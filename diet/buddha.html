<h1>Buddhist Dietary Customs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Buddhism is an offspring of various sects lumped under "Hinduism" and 
 of Jainism. While eventually driven out of India it still flourishes in 
surrounding countries and may be the fourth most populous religion in 
the world. Including an even wider range of ethnicities and languages 
than Hinduism, variation in dietary customs is to be expected.

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Buddhism was founded in about 500 BCE by a Nepalese prince named 
Siddhartha Gautama. He was a fully trained and certified warrior and 
scheduled to become king, but instead escaped from the palace by night 
and wandered about India as a mendicant trying various forms to 
achieve enlightenment. He adopted Jainism, tried asceticism, studied 
Vedic Hinduism and non-Vedic Hinduism, all to no avail. He finally 
succeeded while meditating under a Bodhi tree (Sacred Fig Tree 
<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), and from that time on was known as Gautama 
Buddha.</p>

<p>The Buddha spent the rest of his life teaching the dharma (the 
underlying order of life, nature and the cosmos). Upon his death at 80 
his well briefed disciples continued the teaching and Buddhism became 
a major influence on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. It is, however, 
endlessly debated whether Buddhism is a religion or a philosophy.</p>

<p>The Hindu Brahmins were very much against Buddhism because it negated 
the caste system. They campaigned vigorously against it, even making 
changes in Hinduism (like promoting the cow cult) and succeeded in 
driving it almost entirely out of India by the 12th century CE. Recently, 
though, it's started to seep back in.</p>

<p>Buddhism did survive and thrive in surrounding countries and is 
thought to now be the fourth most populous "religion".  The major 
branches of Buddhism are Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, as 
detailed below.</p>
<br>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>No killing</b> of any sentient being (similar to Jainism) nor using 
  animal products (milk, eggs, leather, feathers, etc. - similar to 
  vegan). Oddly, the cuisines of all the predominantly Buddhist populations 
  feature meat.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Alcohol</b> and other intoxicants are forbidden because they may 
  result in violations of others of the  "Five Moral Precepts": 
  no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying or partaking of 
  intoxicants. Also intoxicants cloud the mind and interfere with the 
  concentration needed to achieve enlightenment.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Onions, Garlic, Scallions, Chives and Leeks</b>, "the five pungent 
  spices" are forbidden for some sects (China, Vietnam) for pretty much 
  the same reason as in Hinduism, they're said to lead to anger (raw) and 
  passion (cooked), but the Buddhists add that their odors repel gods and 
  attract hungry ghosts and demons.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Meat Eating Among Buddhists</h2>

<p>Give the rules stated above, it may seem strange that the world's Buddhist 
populations are predominantly meat eaters, and they honor neither the Hindu 
ban on cow nor the Muslim ban on pig. They do, however, prefer that the 
slaughtering be done by Chinese or Muslims, though Christians will do too if 
any are on hand. If a Buddhist must kill an animal there are certain last 
rites to be performed for the beast, depending on sect.</p>

<p>Strict adherence to vegetarianism is the rule for priests, monks, nuns 
and those who feel they are on the Bodhisattva path - except in some schools 
and sects. The Buddha himself is reported to have died from eating 
tainted pork. Some apologists say it was mushrooms but pork is well 
documented. This pork may have been provided in accordance with the exception 
rule (see below) or it may not.</p>

<p>It is said the Buddha sometimes ate meat that was prepared specifically 
for him in violation of the exception rule. This is said to be to 
demonstrate freedom from attachment - even attachment to the rules of 
Buddhism. Either that or he just kinda liked the stuff.</p>
<br>

<h3>Theravada Buddhism</h3>

<p><img src="img/asoka1s.jpg" alt="Asoka" class=mrg>
Theravada (Teaching of the Elders) is the oldest surviving form of 
Buddhism. It is prevalent in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, 
and Laos. It is also practiced by some ethnic groups in Vietnam, parts of 
southwestern China. Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. While gaining 
popularity in Singapore, Australia and California, it is also the form 
that's sneaking back into India.</p>

<p>Monks and priests of Theravada are generally mendicants who depend for 
their sustenance on donations by the people. In some regions most young men 
are drafted to be monks for a particular period of service before re-entering 
the community as full adults.</p>

<p>In Burma the monks march out in the morning in their saffron robes carrying 
their begging bowls and the people crowd around to place their offerings in 
the bowls. In other areas this process may be much less formalized.</p>

<p>Clearly monks have little control over what is put in the bowl, and are 
expected to eat whatever food is placed there. Because the population is not 
vegetarian meat may be what is on hand and may be included and it is allowed 
to be eaten in accordance with standard rules.</p>

<p>The standard rule is: meat must not have been prepared specifically for you 
and you must not have seen or been in any way involved in the slaughter of 
the beast. If you are an unexpected guest in a household and you were unaware 
they happened to be serving roast pig, they may offer it to you and you may 
eat it. If you were an expected guest and they prepared roast pig for you 
you must decline it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <small>Photo of an Asoka pillar

<h3>Mahayana Buddhism</h3>

<p><img src="img/bodhisattva1s.jpg" alt="Bodhisattva" class=mrg>
Mahayana Buddhism began developing out of Theravada Buddhism in about 
100 BCE. It was carried to China as early as 200 CE but did not become  
significant in India until around 500 CE. It is now the dominant form of 
Buddhism in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The Japanese Zen 
school was the most popular version in California but massive influx of 
both Theravada and Vietnamese Mahayana from Southeast Asia since the 
Vietnam War as well as support for Tibet has pushed Zen into the 
background.</p>

<p>Mahayana monasteries were well supported financially and acquired 
considerable land, so the monks were able to raise plenty of food for 
their own use. Mahayana monks and nuns are, therefore, expected to 
follow a strictly vegetarian diet in accordance with the Buddha's 
doctrine of no killing, along with subscripts that shunning all animal 
products facilitates enlightenment. Many vegetarian recipes developed 
by and for the monks are to be found in cookbooks from the countries 
within the Mahayana range. Strangely, many of them mimic meat dishes 
as closely as possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the major Japanese Kamakura sects, Zen, Nichiren 
and Jodo, have loosened the rules and do not required vegetarianism. 
Chinese and most Korean Buddhist monks and nuns are strict vegetarians. 
This often includes non-violence to plants so root vegetables are off the 
menu in favor of beans and fruit. Some sects observe this additional 
strictness only during special occasions. &nbsp; &nbsp; <small>Photo

<h3>Vajrayana Buddhism</h3> 

<p><img src="img/tibet01s.jpg" alt="Tibetan Prayer Wheel" class=mrg>
This tantric form developed from Mahayana and is now prevalent in Tibet, 
Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Arunachal Pradish (Indian state) and some areas 
of the Russian Far East, Siberia and Manchuria. In the U.S. it is 
generally known just as "Tibetan Buddhism" and is becoming more popular 
here along with support for Tibet.</p>

<p>In the region dominated by Vajrayana neither the people nor the monks 
and nuns have had the luxury of vegetarianism - year round agriculture is 
simply impossible. For this reason, and explaining that their tantric 
practice makes vegetarianism unnecessary, Tibetan Buddhists do not 
attempt to avoid meat.</p>

<p>Though many monks and lamas have fled Tibet and live in vegetarian 
parts of India or other countries where a vegetarian way is not 
difficult, they retain their meat eating ways. American and European 
converts from other Buddhist forms often give up their vegetarianism 
as well to be more in tune with their lama (<a href="buddha.html#h01">1</a>).
