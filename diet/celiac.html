<h3>Celiac Disease</h3> (gluten intolerance) is a serious autoimmune 
condition of genetic origin and estimated to affect 1 in 133 Americans. 
Even minute amounts of gluten in the diet cause an autoimmune reaction 
which degrades the lining of the small intestine and it's ability to 
absorb nutrition.<p></p>
<h3>"Gluten Free"</h3> is also a fad diet highly promoted by some people 
and product developers because it is high profit. It is promoted as a 
weight loss diet and to treat Attention Deficit Disorder, but studies 
have shown it is ineffective for both those applications.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is not a medical site. Nothing here should be considered medical 
advice in diagnosis or treatment of any disorder or disease - qualified 
practitioners should be consulted. This overview from publicly 
available documents may help persons who do not have a gluten problem 
in understanding associates who do.</p>

<h3>Celiac Disease</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This serious 
autoimmune condition is estimated to affect about 1 in 133 Americans (it 
has been much under diagnosed in the US) and seems to be more prevalent 
now than it was 60 years ago, for unknown reasons. This condition results 
in digestive problems, often painful, and in gradual degradation of the 
small intestine, resulting in malnutrition and possibly cancer. It is an 
inherited condition, so tends to run in families.
<p>There is no cure and the only effective treatment is to completely 
avoid even the most tiny amounts of gluten protein in the diet. This is 
a particular problem for Catholics because communion wafers contain 
gluten.</p>
<p>Celiac disease, when suspected, must be tested for <u>before</u> 
taking up a gluten free diet. Properly certified medical practitioners 
should be consulted, and reputable dieticians trained in this disorder 
should tests prove positive.</p>
<p><u>Helpful Information</u>: &nbsp; There are now a number of 
organizations devoted to this potentially debilitating problem (see 
<a href="celiac.html#links"><b>Links</b></a> for a few), including one specific to 
helping celiac <a href="celiac.html#g05"><b>College Students</b></a> through the 
unique problems of that environment.</p>

<h3>Gluten Sensitivity</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This non-celiac 
reaction was formerly disregarded but is now considered real by medical 
practitioners. Some say it is more prevalent than Celiac Disease, but 
this is still under study. It may, in fact, not be due to gluten but 
to carbohydrates called FODMAPs, which are common in foods high in 
gluten. It is nowhere near as dangerous to health as celiac disease, 
but can be similarly painful.<p></p>

<h3>Gluten Free Diet</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  While absolutely 
essential for celiac sufferers, and definitely indicated for gluten 
sensitivity, "Gluten Free" is being heavily promoted by various people 
and businesses for their own financial benefit. It is promoted as a 
weight loss diet and a treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder. Actual 
tests have shown this diet ineffective for both these problems, and it 
has nutritional risks.<p></p>

<h2>Nutritional Risks</h2>

<p>Celiac Disease will result in nutritional deficiencies due to 
degradation of the small intestine. On the other hand, a Gluten Free 
diet can result in nutritional deficiencies because gluten free 
foods may be deficient. For this reason, medical practitioners recommend 
against a gluten free diet for those for whom it is not medically 
necessary, and recommend special care and supplementation for whom it is. 
These deficiencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Calcium</li>
<li>Fiber</li>
<li>Thiamin</li>
<li>Riboflavin</li>
<li>Niacin</li>
<li>Folate</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Diet Requirements</h2>

<p>Maintaining a gluten free diet is not easy, because many processed 
foods include some gluten or are cross contaminated. Even those labeled 
"wheat free" can contain gluten. Great care in selecting foods is a 
requirement.</p>

<p>All gluten bearing items are grains, the seeds of grasses - but 
not all grass seeds contain gluten.

<p>Grains containing gluten and thus to be avoided.:
  <ul>
  <li>Wheat - the worst of all - and it's near relatives
    <ul>
    <li>Triticale</li>
    <li>Einkorn</li>
    <li>Emmer</li>
    <li>Faro</li>
    <li>Spelt</li>
    <li>Kamut</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Barley</li>
  <li>Rye</li>
  <li>Oats - possibly some varieties, or from cross contamination.</li>
  </ul>
Grains (grass seeds) that are safe for celiacs (if not cross contaminated).
  <ul>
  <li>Rice - including "glutenous rice".</li>
  <li>Oats - if certified gluten free (<a href="celiac.html#g02">G2</a>).</li>
  <li>Corn - if not processed with gluten containing ingredients</li>
  <li>Wild Rice.</li>
  </ul>
Non grass "grains" are all safe for celiacs, including:
  <ul>
  <li>Amaranth seeds.</li>
  <li>Buckwheat</li>
  <li>Quinoa.</li>
  </ul>
