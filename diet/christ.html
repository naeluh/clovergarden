<h1>Christian Dietary Customs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Christianity, despite its later adoption of Jewish scriptures, is 
essentially a powerful offshoot of the Pagans. The Jews were very 
resistant to converting, so early Christians were recruited mainly from 
the Greco / Roman culture of Asia Minor and the Near East, and later by 
wholesale conversion of the Pagan tribes of Europe, almost always 
"conversion by the sword", and destruction of Pagan shrines and temples 
by mob violence.</p>

<p>In so doing, Christianity, already a pastiche of the Cult of the Dying 
God (Isis & Osirus) and whatever else was going around at the time, 
adopted 
a great deal of pagan culture and symbology. All the major Pagan holidays 
were adopted, with a little renaming (in the case of Easter they didn't 
even bother renaming) and assignment of Christian mythology to them. Some 
favorite local deities were converted to saints, and Mary, mother of 
Jesus, was re-formulated as a replacement for Vesta, the favorite goddess 
of Rome, to make conversion easier.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Whether or not Jesus the Christ was actually a living person is still 
hotly debated. Unlike the Buddha of 550 years before, we don't have 
detailed contemporaneous records of his life, appearance, travels and 
dietary preferences. Despite high hopes, no certifiable physical evidence 
has been found by modern archaeology - nor was any found by Origen 
(185 - 254 CE), an early and influential father of the Church. The 
earliest datable fragment of a Christian manuscript is from a little 
before 256 CE.</p>

<p>This point, however, is of almost no importance - relevant only to our 
current very literal age. It would have been of little interest in the 
time of Christianity's founding - but if he was actually born it was in 
the spring, not at Christmas time. Tax time during the Roman Empire was 
in the spring as it is today, and shepherds and their flocks would not 
have been out in the hills in winter.</p>

<p>The birth of Jesus was conveniently assigned to Saturnalia / Sol 
Invictus, a holidays the Pagans were not about to give up. Despite a few 
manger scenes and Christmas carols, our current Christmas celebration is 
far more in keeping with the Saternalia than it is with any specifically 
Christian ritual.<p>

<p>This serves as an example of how Christianity, already descended 
largely from Pagan (and possibly Jain and Buddhist) thought, adapted 
rather freely to the cultures it absorbed. Egypt, on the other hand, 
held to it's traditional religion until the (by then Christian) Roman 
Emperor decreed a death penalty for anyone who did so, and enforced 
it.</p>

<p>Ambitious Christian leaders, however, finding in Christ's doctrine no 
justification for a powerful authoritarian church, fixed that by adopting 
the vigorously authoritarian Jewish scriptures and tacking their own 
material onto the back end of it. In my opinion this Old Testament 
material should be ignored by anyone calling themselves Christian, and 
some sects do reject it.</p>
<br>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<p>There aren't any rules. Christians eat and drink whatever they 
please, and generally base their regional cuisines on what is available 
economically and what was eaten by their non-Christian ancestors - as 
well as adapting the rituals and symbology of their ancestry into 
Christianity.</p>

<p>In an event some years ago in South America, survivors of a plane 
crash resorted to eating non-survivors to continue surviving (the non 
survivors were frozen, so did not spoil). After their rescue it was 
found they would not be punished in the hereafter because the Catholic 
Church has no prohibitions even against eating people, though neither 
the Church nor I (see <a href="../ingred/ao_human.html"><b>Human</b></a>) 
recommend the practice.</p>

<p>Such a prohibition would sort of conflict with the ritual of the 
Eucharist where the wine and wafer are magically transubstantiated into 
the blood and body of the Christ, now wouldn't it?</p>

<p>It is true though, a few sects do take the Jewish material more 
seriously and make at least a half hearted attempt to adhere to Jewish 
dietary laws, but as I've already mentioned, inclusion of this material 
into Christianity is rather questionable.</p>
