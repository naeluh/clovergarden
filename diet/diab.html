<p>
Diabetes is a condition where the body does not automatically control 
its blood sugar level, so it has to be controled "by hand".  This 
is a medical issue, so I'm providing just a short introduction for those 
who need to understand the basics. Anyone with diabetes or who needs 
to care for a person with the condition should refer to qualified medical 
sources (see <a href="diab.html#links">Links</a> section) and seek the advice of a 
physician.

<h2 id="class">Overview</h2>

<p>There are two main forms of diabetes (<i>diabetes mellitus</i>):</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Type 1:</h3> &nbsp; Faiure of the pancreas to produce any or 
    sufficient insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar level. The 
    cause is often an autoimmune attack commonly during childhood. This form 
    accounts for about 10% of all cases and can be controlled only with 
    externally supplied insulin, generally by injection. Diet and lifestyle 
    are also factors in controlling this form.<p></p></li>

  <li><h3>Type 2:</h3> &nbsp; Also called "adult onset diabetes" this form 
    is the result of the body's loss of sensativity to insulin. Causes are 
    still being studied but are generally related to factors of lifestyle 
    and diet, particularly excess internal abdominal fat. It is generally 
    treated by diet and exercise and by drugs when more severe, but can 
    progress to the point of requiring external insulin sources. It is 
    important it be kept under control because it can result in heart 
    disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, liver failure and blindness.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Diabetic symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Blood sugar too low</h3> (hypoglycemia): &nbsp; tired, confused, 
    cranky, shaky, sweaty. Generally corrected by consuming fruit juices 
    or some other sugar containing beverage.</li>
  <li><h3>Blood sugar too high</h3> (hyperglycemia): &nbsp; thirsty, 
    excessive urination, blurred vision. Generally corrected according to 
    instructions from a doctor.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

<h2>Diet</h2>

<p>Coping with diabetes takes serious attention to exercise, weight 
control, diet and careful monitoring of blood sugar level. Proper diet 
is a key factor that should be configured under the guidance of a 
certified dietician, particularly because it's not a one size fits all 
situation.</p>

<p>A recommended diet is likely to include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Eating frequently but in modest portions.</li>
  <li>Increased whole-grain foods, fruits and vegetables.</li>
  <li>Selected carbohydrates: 45% to 65% of daily calories.</li>
  <li>Less protein: 15% to 20% of daily calories.</li>
  <li>Less fats: 20% to 35% of daily calories.</li>
  <li>Eating a large variety of foods.</li> 
  <li>Severely limiting sweets.</li>
  <li>Limiting alcohol (makes control more difficult).</li>
  <li>Lower salt.</li>
  <li>Higher fiber.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Parts of the diet will be aimed at lowering the risk of heart disease 
which can be an increased risk to diabetics.</p>
