<h1>Heart-Healthy Diet</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The term "Heart-Healthy Diet" is most associated with the American 
Heart Association. It was introduced in 1956 as the "Prudent Diet" 
and reflects the views of the American medical establishment - although 
much of the underlying science seems questionable. It also reflects the 
lobbying efforts of the powerful seed oil cartels, so it's been codified 
into legislation and government diet recommendations.

<h2 class="over">Overview</h2>

<p>The stated purpose of the AHA diet is prevention of cardiovascular 
disease, particularly myocardial infraction (heart attack). From its 
original configuration, it has needed serious modifications several 
times, and still needs serious re-evaluation. Today, its main points 
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of fat in the diet to 25% to 35% of calories and replacement 
  of saturated fats and trans fats with mono and polyunsaturated fats.</li>
<li>Severe reduction of Cholesterol in the diet.</li>
<li>Reduction of meat protein in the diet as a tool for reducing both 
  saturated fats and cholesterol.</li>
<li>Use of fat free or 1% dairy products.</li>
<li>Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>Increase in fiber from whole grains, beans, etc.</li>
<li>Limit sweets, deserts and sugary sodas.</li>
<li>Keep alcohol consumption moderate.</li>
<li>Reduction of Salt in the diet (to a level salt metabolism experts 
  consider near dangerous).</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 class="prob">Comments on the Diet</h2>

<p>For most of it's existence, the AHA enthusiastically endorsed using 
trans fats in place of the natural fats we evolved with, and the use 
of polyunsaturated "vegetable oils". Trans fats had to be removed 
when incontrovertible research proved them to be the most dangerous 
fats you could consume.</p>

<p>Even when New York was considering banning trans fats entirely, the 
AHA was still promoting them, and still claiming margarine was better 
for you than butter - I personally verified this on their Web site.
This is not surprising, since their first financing was by Crisco, first 
major trans fat product, and they have been supported by the seed oil 
industry, makers of trans fats and polyunsaturated "vegetable oils".</p>

<p>When forced to remove trans fats, they replaced it with 
"monounsaturated fats", which to them means Canola Oil, itself a very 
questionable product (see <a href="heart.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). They have 
never come out in favor of Olive Oil, which everyone else recommends - 
it is not a seed oil but a fruit oil, similar to Avocado Oil.</p>

<p>They have always supported highly processed polyunsaturated seed 
oils, called "vegetable oils". These are extracted with high heat and 
toxic petroleum solvents, then distilled to drive off (most of) the 
solvents. By this time, any fragile Omega-3 fats have been converted 
to trans fats. The oil is rancid, discolored, and stinks. It is then 
bleached and deodorized. Not exactly a "natural" product.</p>

<p>They had to include the monounsaturated fats because excess 
polyunsaturated fats were increasingly suspected of causing cancer, 
and in any case, disrupted the natural balance of Omega-6 oils to 
Omega-3 oils. It is entirely Omega-6, most Omega-3 in the feed oil 
has been destroyed by the heat of processing.</p>

<p>They AHA continues to demonize saturated fats, even though their 
original "proof" was by a severely defective study. It was based on 
hydrogenated fats and also included a sharp reduction in sugar 
consumption. Sugar, is now known to cause heart disease, and this 
reduction is thought to have produced the positive results.</p> 

<p>This demonization is not supported by history, demographics, or 
recent science. In fact, research has shown that a sufficient amount 
of saturated fats in the diet can protect the body from the ravages 
of polyunsaturated fats.</p> 

<p>Also from bad science, was their shrill condemnation of eggs and 
shrimp, because both contain cholesterol. This had to be toned down 
when valid research showed that the body produces the cholesterol it 
needs itself, and if it does absorb some from the diet, it reduces 
the amount it is making. Cholesterol is absolutely needed for cell 
membranes, and you brain is made mostly of cholesterol.</p>

<p>Do-gooders following AHA guidelines hounded the fast food industry 
into abandoning beef tallow for deep frying. The industry found they 
couldn't use the recommended polyunsaturated oils (corn, soy, sunflower, 
safflower, cottonseed, etc.) because they became unusably rancid and 
stinky in less than a day - beef tallow lasted a month.</p>

<p>Instead the fast food industry had to use more durable partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils called "trans fats" which were at the time 
heavily endorsed by the AHA. Further scientific research proved trans 
fats to be more dangerous than any other form of fat. The fast food 
industry is now trying to move to gene-modified oils that mimic olive 
oil, and to fully hydrogenated oils. Fully hydrogenated oils are known 
as "saturated fats", what the AHA wanted to get us away from in the 
first place. The public would have been better served sticking with 
beef tallow.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="res">Results</h2>

<p>Coconut oil, an AHA demonized "Tropical Oil", has the most 
saturated fat available (92% vs. 44% for lard). Significant populations 
cook <u>everything</u> in coconut oil, or coconut oil and lard, Thailand, 
for instance. These populations show no signs of the heart disease 
the AHA theory predicts. Many nutritionists now consider Coconut Oil 
to be the healthiest oil you can use.</p>

<p>At the kick-off for the AHA's Prudent Diet one panel member was an 
elderly cardiologist, Dr. Dudley White. He pointed out that when he 
started his career (1921) the U.S. practically lived on lard and butter, 
yet he didn't see a single case of myocardial infraction until 1928. 
His opinion: "I think that we would all benefit from the kind of diet 
that we had at the time when no one had ever heard the word corn oil". 
It should be noted that cancer was almost unknown at that time as well.
</p>

<p>Today, Heart Disease and Cancer are the major killers, and the 
situation continues to get worse. It got that bad pretty much in 
step with the increased use of trans fats and polyunsaturated oils.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the Prudent Diet (1957), Dr Norman Jolliffe, 
Director of the Nutrition Bureau of the New York Health Department, 
initiated the "Anti-Coronary Club", composed of selected businessmen, 
ranging in age from 40 to 59 years old, who were placed on the Prudent 
Diet. Club members used corn oil and margarine instead of butter, cold 
breakfast cereals instead of eggs and chicken, and fish instead of 
beef.</p>

<p>By 1966, Club members were shown to have serum cholesterol of 220, 
opposed to 250 in the control group that ate meat three times a day. 
Problem: 8 members of the Club had died, and none in the control 
group had died. Dr. Jolliffe had hoped the diet would save him, but 
he had also died, of a blood clot.</p>

<p>In the period 2003 - 2004 huge numbers of Americans were on the 
<a href="atkin.html">Atkins Diet</a> eating substantial amounts of 
saturated animal fats along with the large amount of animal protein 
called for by that diet. I suppose they all should have died, but 
instead they showed no particular increase in cholesterol problems 
or artery clogging. A couple of friends of mine were on the Atkins 
Diet, and closely monitored by a physician. No problems were seen.</p>

<p>Of course the AHA has studies to support its positions, but lets be 
realistic about research - it's very expensive, but doesn't generate a 
revenue stream to fund itself. Scientists are completely dependent on 
grants, directly or indirectly from people with money, who want 
scientific "proof" for whatever it is they make that money from. 
Scientists, consciously or unconsciously, are likely to frame their 
research and interpret their result to favor the outcome that's being 
paid for - their very survival depends on it.</p>

<p>In my admittedly non-medical opinion, demographics are definitive. 
"Do people who eat a whole lot of this stuff have the problems studies 
predict?" If not, there's something wrong with the studies.</p>
