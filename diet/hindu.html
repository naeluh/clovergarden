<h1>Hindu Dietary Customs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Spanning a vast region from Kashmir to Bali, thousands of years, diverse 
peoples and languages as different as Hindi (Indo-European) and Tamil 
(Dravidian), Hindu dietary customs could hardly be expected to be uniform, 
and they aren't. Here we've got your hard core vegetarians, and we've got 
your spit roasted pig - and even beef in some regions and cities.

<h2 id="over">Overview</h2>

<p>"Hinduism" is a British invention, to conveniently lump together a 
whole lot of somewhat different but related religions, philosophies and 
cultures of the Indian Subcontinent. This term, while imprecise, is much 
in common use outside India, without regard to the details, and has 
come to represent a diverse religio-cultural expanse, even in India.</p>

<p>Considering Hindu as a religious complex, it is the third most populous 
religion in the world, dominating  India, Nepal and Bali with significant 
populations in other South and Southeast Asian countries. Beyond its 
traditional range, the Hindu population of the Americas is nearly 2.5 
million with 1.4 million in the U.S. while Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad 
and Tobago in South America are together about one third Hindu.</p>

<p>Other religions native to the region are Sikhism and Jainism but they 
are both significantly different. Buddhism is an offspring of Jainism and 
various Hindu cults. Whether the Hare Krishna cult should be added to 
the Hindu count is debatable as they themselves say not, but waffle a 
bit on that point. They do, however, use the Hindu texts and adhere to 
the <a href="hindu.html#brahm"><b>Brahman Diet</b></a>. 

<p>Hinduism very much dominates the entirety of India, except the far 
northeastern corner where Christianity dominates. Islam has a 
significant minority presence in many Indian states. In Kerala, in 
the far southwest, Islam and Christianity both have a significant 
share, while Hinduism still holds a small majority.</p>

<p>Though it's thought not actually a part of Hinduism, a major feature 
of Indian society is the caste system (<a href="hindu.html#h01"><b>Link-1</b></a>). 
Exactly how this complex and very rigid structure developed is a subject 
of conjecture. The sacred Vedas do divide people into four Varnas 
(castes) but not with the complexity or hereditary rigidly of the current 
system. In any case, a person's caste and region affect how s/he is 
expected to adhere to the various dietary customs.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="gen">General Rules</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Tamas, Rajas and Sattva.</h3> - these Ayurvedic "vibrations" are 
characteristics of various foods and affect both the physical and astral 
bodies. This is the root theory behind various Hindu food customs.
<ul>
  <li><b>Tamasic</b> (heavy) foods, such as meat and fermented foods 
    (including alcohol), promote dullness and inertia.</li>
  <li><b>Rajasic</b> (expanding) foods, including onions, garlic, hot 
    spices, stimulants, fish, eggs and salt, are thought to excite 
    intellect and passion, which interfere with meditation.</li>
  <li><b>Sattvic</b> (ascending) foods, including fruits, vegetables and 
   grains, are thought to promote transcendence, sublimity and 
   orderliness.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Clearly those of higher caste should adhere to the Sattvic for their 
spiritual development, while the middle castes indulge in the rajasic and 
the lower castes in the tamasic - they're thought spiritually beyond 
hope anyway.</p>
    
<h3>Vegetarianism:</h3> &nbsp; Large numbers of Hindus (perhaps as many 
as 30%) are vegetarian, depending on region and sect, though strictness 
varies. In some regions fish are eaten as "fruits of the sea" (what a 
cop-out). Vegetarianism is practiced particularly in the southern 
regions of India and in Gujarat on the northwest coast. Members of the 
Brahman caste are supposed to be vegetarian (see 
<a href="hindu.html#brahm"><b>Brahman Diet</b></a>), but in some areas Brahmans 
traditionally eat meat.<p></p>

<h3>Onions &amp; Garlic</h3> and all other members of the <i>Allium</i>  
genus including shallots, chives, leeks, etc. are forbidden to many 
Hindu sects and castes. Onions and garlic inhibit transcendence by 
clouding one's mind with "passion" (rajasic). Others say they cause 
"odors of the breath" which are offensive to Lord Krishna. Problem: 
no onions or garlic leaves a huge hole in the flavor spectrum which 
is partially patched by using the "aromatic" resin Asafoetida.<p></p>

<h3>Asafoetida</h3>, resin from a plant related to celery and fennel, 
has the same sulfurous stink as SAE 90 weight hypoid gear oil. Tiny 
amounts are fried briefly in hot oil before adding other ingredients 
to tame the odor and develop the flavor. It provides a complexity and 
sophistication similar in effect to the onions and garlic (also 
sulfurous) forbidden to many Hindu cooks.<p></p>

<h3>Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; have been avoided by the higher castes because 
they "grow in dung and unclean ground", however morels have long been 
picked and enjoyed in Kashmir, and significant mushroom farming operations 
have been started in Kerala, Karnataka and other states.<p></p>

<h3>Pigs</h3> are not forbidden by Hinduism except by those sects that 
ban all meat. Some regions do not eat pork due to lingering influence 
of Mughal (Muslim) rule. On the other hand not much pork is consumed in 
India except in a few areas that traditionally hunted wild boar or are 
near the border with China. Most of India can't afford to eat pork, 
because pigs would compete directly with humans for food, and there 
just isn't enough to go around.<p></p>

<h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; That cows are sacred to Hindus is well known but 
not exactly accurate. It is true a large part of the Hindu population 
venerate cows as "The Mother" and do not eat beef, but in some states, 
and within some castes, cow is definitely eaten. The largest amount of 
beef production, consumption, and export in India is Water Buffalo 
(Carabeef). In any case, in 2019, more than 2.6 million metric tons 
of beef and veal were eaten in India, and 1.6 million metric tons were 
exported.

<p><img src="img/indiacow01e.jpg" alt="Cow slaughter laws in India" class=mrg>
Whether or not the sacred Vedas prohibit slaughtering cows depends 
on who is translating and what verses are selected as "proof", but they 
were probably eaten in those times, at least to some extent. Veneration 
of cows probably stems from the rise of the Krishna cult, from economics, 
and from Brahmanism's response to Buddhism. Milk and milk products, like 
butter and yogurt, are more efficient use of the animals.</p>

<p>Battles over banning slaughter of cows are very complex and extremely 
political. The bans are often seen as moves by the upper casts to 
maintain control, and as part of anti-Muslim pogroms. The bans have 
resulted in widespread smuggling of cattle from states that ban 
slaughter to those that don't. Eating beef is not banned in any state.
</p>

<p>Consumption of milk and milk products brings up the always 
embarrassing problem of what to do with male calves, which will never 
be good milk producers (and aren't "The Mother" either). In the northwest 
states, there is a total ban on cattle slaughter, but in most of India, 
slaughter of male cattle is legal, and often cows over a certain age. 
Some activists say that since all cattle shit, and cowpies are dried 
and used for household fuel, none qualify as non-productive.

<h2 id="vers">Versions <small>&amp;</small> Regions</h2>

<p>This section is by no means comprehensive of what is eaten by Hindus 
in India - that varies from state to state and from one side of a state 
to another. Only about 30% of Hindus are vegetarians, so the rest eat 
whatever animals, birds, fish and shellfish are available and allowed 
by the religious doctrine they follow. The diets listed here are 
are of particular current or historical interest. <br>

<h3 id="brahm">The Brahman Diet</h3>
<br>This diet is familiar to many Americans as that promoted by the 
Hare Krishna cult and it is the diet members of the Brahman caste are 
expected to adhere to in India and elsewhere. The objective is to 
emphasize sattvic foods, minimize rajasic and eliminate tamasic foods.
 
<ul>
<li><b>Meat</b> is forbidden along with all meat products.</li>
<li><b>Eggs</b> are forbidden.</li>
<li><b>Milk</b> and milk products are permitted, butter, yogurt, cream, 
  etc. (but in India they're very expensive).</li>
<li><b>Cheese</b> must not be coagulated with rennet (an animal product). 
  In India the acid coagulated cheese panir predominates. It is roughly 
  the same as hoop cheese, a form of farmer's cheese with more of the 
  liquid squeezed out.</li>
<li><b>Onions</b> - forbidden along with all other members of the 
  <i>Allium</i> genus, including garlic, scallions, chives, shallots, 
  etc.</li>
<li><b>Mushrooms</b> are forbidden along with all other fungi.</li>
<li><b>Stimulants</b> - coffee, tea, etc. are rajastic and to be avoided 
  as they interfere with meditation.</li>
<li><b>Alcohol</b> - no.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are, of course, exceptions. In Kashmir Brahmans eat meat (though 
not beef) and to a lesser extent in Orissa, Bengal and Maharashtra where 
eggs, fish, chicken and even lamb and goat may be included.</p>
<br>

<h3>Hare Krishna Diet</h3>
<br><img src="img/krishna1m.jpg" alt="Krishna" class=mrg>
<p>The Hare Krishna cult (International Society of Krishna Consciousness) 
adheres quite strictly to the Brahman Diet, but adapts some Western foods 
to it. They have always been rather food oriented and run a worldwide 
chain of dining halls called "Govindas" where inexpensive sattvic food 
is served (non-believers are welcome). The food is good enough to have 
been listed by Saveur magazine in their annual top 100 favorite things 
(Jan/Feb 2008). Back in the mid 1970s I ate a few meals at the main 
Los Angeles temple and the food was good then too. I met A.C. 
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in person back then, but in 1977 ISKCON  
fell on confusing times due to lack of succession planning.

<br>

<h3>Muslim Influence</h3>
<br><img src="img/taj01c.jpg" alt="Taj Mahal" class=mrg>
<p>From 1206 to 1857 Muslim invaders ruled various parts of India and 
nearly all of India at the height of the Mughal (Mongol) Empire around 
1800. They established a culinary tradition based on Persian cuisine 
melded with Indian ingredients. This tradition continues in the current 
era even though the population is now nearly all Hindu. It predominates 
in the Northwest and is also found in the city of Hyderabad in east 
central India.
 
<p>This Mughal cuisine is the one most familiar to Americans as 
"Indian cuisine". It's spicing is rich and aromatic with dishes including 
lamb, chicken, yogurt and cheese but beef and pork are not eaten. Leavened 
naan bread is commonly served as are complex rice pilafs. Most predominant 
in Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi and Hyderabad.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h3>Gujarat</h3>
<br><img src="img/sri_nathji1c.jpg" alt="Sri Nathji" class=mrg>
With the meat eaters of Pakistan and Rajasthan to the north and the 
seafood eaters of Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat is noted for 
uncompromising and sophisticated vegetarian cuisine. About 89% of 
Gujarat's population is Hindu, with the sect of Shrinathji (a form of 
Krishna (a form of Vishnu)) predominating. It is also home of the sect 
Bhagawan Swaminarayan founded based on love, peace, purity and 
non-violence. Vegetarian Jains, though, account for only about 1% 
of the population.

<p>Meat, chicken, fish and other animal flesh is little used in Gujarat, 
but milk products are very popular, with Gujarat the largest milk producer 
in India. Followers of Swaminarayan do not eat eggs but other Gurjarati 
do. "Roti" flat bread, usually made of millet, is much served but so is 
rice and a very wide variety of seasonal vegetables and pulses. Dishes 
tend to be a bit sweeter than in other parts of India.</p>

<p>Gurjarat is an educated and highly industrialized area so it both has 
considerable influence on the rest of India and attracts outsiders who 
seek employment there. Many Gurjarati have taken up residence in the U.S. 
and other Western countries filling technical positions.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h3>Udupi</h3>
<br><img src="img/Udupi01h.jpg" alt="Sri Krishna Temple" class=mrg>
Udupi is in Karnataka state, on the west coast of India south of 
Maharashtra. Here, in the 13th century, was established the Udupi Sri 
Krishna Temple. This temple became the center for the most strict, 
and most inventive purely Sattvic cuisine. This cuisine is now world 
famous, and Udupi restaurants are found all over India and beyond.

<p>Also in Karnataka, a bit south from Udupi, live the Kodava people, 
who are barely Indian by culture, and not Hindu by religion. They erect 
no images of gods and do not recognize the caste system at all. The 
history of this warrior people is unknown, whether they came from 
somewhere else, or have always been there. In Kodava, pork is the 
favorite meat, with lamb, chicken and fish also appearing on the 
dinner table.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h3>The (largely) Vegetarian Southeast</h3>
<br><img src="img/hindu4m.jpg" alt="Temple" class=mrg>
<p>While the Mughali cuisine of northern India has been most familiar to 
Americans as "Indian cuisine", restaurants specializing in the famous 
vegetarian cuisines of Southeastern India are now becoming common, 
especially in Southern California, but also in New York.</p>

<p>Dal (split and peeled pigeon peas, mung beans and lentils) is the 
foundation of the cuisine, but rice is also much used, Coconut and coconut 
milk are major ingredient and frying is done largely in coconut oil. Dairy 
products are expensive but yogurt is popular. Rather than bread thin lacy 
pancakes made from a mix of rice and dal are widely served.</p>

<p>Potatoes and many other vegetables are used, usually in combination 
with dal. The green and white balls known here as Thai Eggplants, are 
also the most common eggplants in southeast India. Curry leaves, 
tamarind, and lots of chilis are major spicings, while the aromatic 
spices of the Mughali cuisine are little used. Pickles and chutneys 
appear at every meal.</p>

<p>While southeastern India is famous for its vegetarian cuisine, it 
isn't by any means a totally vegetarian region. In Andhra Pradesh 
(91% Hindu), mutton, chicken and seafoods of all kinds are enjoyed by 
the majority of the population. In Tamil Nadu (88% Hindu), especially 
around the city of Channai (formerly Madras), pork, mutton, chicken 
and seafoods of all kinds are enjoyed by the majority. Muslims (6%) 
skip the pork, but the Christians (6%) will eat anything.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h3>Kerala</h3>
<br><img src="img/kerala01h.jpg" alt="Kathakali Performer" class=mrg>
This is the southernmost state in western India, back to back with 
Tamil Nadu. The cuisine is quite typical of southern India, with a 
lot of coconut used and cooking in coconut oil. Many spices are used 
in Kerala, since it was long a center of the spice trade.

<p>Seafood and fresh water fish are very popular, and chicken has a 
major place on the table, but the most notable feature of Kerala 
cuisine is Beef. Beef is much enjoyed by Hindus (55%), Muslims (27%), 
and Christians (18%) alike. This is a major region for raising, eating, 
and exporting beef.
<br class=cll></p>  
<br>

<h2 id="fast">Fasting - Navaratri Festivals, etc.</h2>

<p><img src="img/Navratr01h.jpg" alt="Durga" class=mrg>
The major Navaratri festival is held in the September - October period, 
and is a 10 day and 9 night festival celebrating victory of good over evil. 
The legends and central character featured vary from one region to another. 
Shown here is Durga, very popular in Maharashtra. Lesser Navaratri occur at 
the other three changes of season.</p>
<p>Many people fast for all or some specific days during the main festival. 
During the fast, certain foods are allowed, and certain are not allowed. 
This varies somewhat with region and family, so the list here is approximate, 
but a fairly good guide. This list is primarily from Uttar Pradesh state in 
northern India, rules may be stricter in Udupi.</p>
<p>?? = opinions vary, consult your religious leaders.
