<h1>Islamic Dietary Law</h1>

<p>
Islamic dietary law may descend from <a href="jewish.html">
<b>Jewish Dietary Law</b></a> but there are significant differences that 
make kosher certifications unreliable guides for Muslims.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Foods (and behavior) are divided into three categories:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Halal</b> - lawful.</li>
  <li><b>Haram</b> - forbidden, unlawful.</li>
  <li><b>Mashbooh, Mushtabahat</b> - questionable or doubtful, to be 
    avoided where possible.</li>
  </ul>
<br>


<h2>Specific Rules</h2>

<p>This list is not exhaustive or in sufficient detail to be a complete 
guide to halal foods. It is more a general guide to persons who have 
found a need to understand the rules well enough to get along. For 
authoritative detail see the <a href="islam.html#links"><b>Links</b></a> section.
</p> 

<p>You need to determine the level of compliance of your guests in advance 
so you will not screw up. Meats are a particular problem due to certified 
halal products being difficult to find in many areas. In such cases a 
vegetarian approach may be a good idea, particularly if your guests are 
fairly strict in their compliance.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Alcohol</h3> is banned, as are any foods prepared with 
  alcohol. For instance you can't use vanilla extract in baked goods 
  because it contains alcohol. The Turks, though, have either obtained 
  a special dispensation from Allah or they're all going straight to Hell 
  with the rest of us. The distilled beverage raki (similar to Greek 
  ouzo) is very popular, wine is used in cooking, and many Turks reserve 
  abstinence for Ramadan.</li>
<li><h3>Animals</h3> that are vegetarian are allowed, including 
  cattle, sheep, goats, deer, bison, camel, wild ass and rabbit. Donkey 
  (domestic) is forbidden and horse is controversial (Mashbooh). In 
  addition, approved animals must be slaughtered in accordance with 
  Islamic law (Zabihah). This must be done by a Muslim while invoking the 
  name of Allah. Slaughter must by by cutting all blood vessels in the 
  neck. There is debate as to whether animals slaughtered by Christians 
  and Jews (People of the Book) can be eaten. The answer tends to "No" 
  (and how can you say the guy who actually did the job wasn't a Hindu,  
  Pagan, or Shamanist?). There  is also a problem with bogus halal 
  certification of packaged meats. The best solution is probably to 
  slaughter your own goat, carefully following the instructions.</li>
<li><h3>Animal Products</h3> from non halal animals are 
  forbidden. Animal shortenings (lard, tallow), gelatin and many other 
  animal extracts used in food processing are forbidden unless the halal 
  and Zabihah status of the source are known - usually impossible.  Blood 
  and products made from blood are forbidden, but liver and spleen 
  (which contain blood) are permitted.</li>
<li><h3>Specifically Forbidden</h3> are pigs, donkeys, mules, dogs, cats, 
  monkeys, elephant, mouse, rat, wild animals and all predators (animals 
  with fangs).  Any animal that has died except by Zabihah slaughter is 
  forbidden except fish that have died by removal from water or by a 
  blow.</li>
<li><h3>Birds</h3> that hunt with talons (hawks, eagles, etc.) and prey 
  on animals or birds are forbidden. Birds that eat seeds and vegetables 
  are permitted (chicken, duck pigeon sparrow, etc.). Birds that eat 
  some forbidden items (chickens eat insects, etc.) are permitted 
  provided such things are not a major part of their diet.</li>
<li><h3>Insects:</h3> &nbsp; Locusts are permitted, all others 
  forbidden.</li>
<li><h3>Pigs</h3> may not be eaten nor any foods derived from pigs, but 
  going beyond Jewish dietary laws Islam forbids having anything whatever 
  to do with pigs. A Muslim is only allowed to sell pork if in an infidel 
  land and if grave hardship would be caused by not doing so. Even then 
  the money must be kept separate from other money and all profit must be 
  given to Muslim charities. Pig leather and other non-food products are 
  also banned. For more on this see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_pigz.html"><b>Pig - Prohibitions</b></a> page.
  </li> 
<li><h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; This is an area of disagreement. Some schools 
  follow the same strict rules as Kashrut (Jewish dietary law). Others 
  permit all fish but not shellfish. A few classify shrimp and prawns 
  as "fish", while still others consider all seafood permitted. In any 
  case, fish that have died in the water are forbidden. Fish killed by 
  removal from water or by a blow are permitted (if they are a permitted 
  fish according to the school of thought to which you subscribe).</li>
<li><h3>Shellfish</h3> are forbidden by some schools, accepted 
  along with all seafoods by others.</li>
<li><h3>Rodents</h3> and other <h3>Pests</h3> are all forbidden, 
  including mouse, hedgehog and rat, but rabbit is permitted (rabbit is 
  scientifically not quite a rodent).</li>
<li><h3>Reptiles and Amphibians</h3> are all forbidden.</li>
<li><h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Here we have controversy. Some schools reject 
  all rennet coagulated cheese because the Zabihah status of the animal 
  is unknown. Others say rennet is not life because blood does not flow 
  thorough it so it doesn't matter. Some say rennet is OK so long as it 
  doesn't come from a pig (redundant, rennet never comes from pigs). 
  Cheeses coagulated with acid (cottage, farmer's, etc.) are generally 
  permitted as are those coagulated using vegetable enzymes.</li>
<li><h3>Whey</h3> is a byproduct of cheese making and products containing 
  it are subject to the same controversy as with cheese.</li>
<li><h3>Fruits and Vegetables</h3> can be eaten, but must be inspected to 
  assure they contain no bugs.</li>
<li><h3>Grains</h3> are all permitted, provided they have not been 
  prepared using animal fats or other forbidden ingredients, and are 
  bug free.</li>
<li><h3>Vinegar</h3> is permitted even though it can only be made 
  from alcohol (wine, beer, etc.). Muslims make some pretty good wine 
  vinegars but they label them "raisin vinegar" or some similar 
  euphemism. They use a continuous process so Allah can't accuse them 
  of making wine and throwing them into the flames of Hell.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Halal Certification</h2>

<p>Unlike kosher certification, halal certification is still pretty 
sparse in North America, and there is considerable dispute among 
certifying organizations, particularly in regard to meats. Fraud is 
fairly common.</p>
