<h1>Jain Dietary Customs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>Jainism is a small religion but an ancient one that has been inordinately 
influential on the culture and religions of India. That archaeologists 
have found evidence of the religion in the Indus Valley civilization of 
5000 to 8000 years ago is highly speculative and generally disregarded, 
but it is well established that it existed before 900 BCE. Currently the 
major region of growth for the Jain religion are the United States, 
where a number of temples have already been constructed, and Japan. 
Converts are being accepted

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Jainism has contributed a great deal to both culture and religion in 
India and from there to the rest of the world. This is because of the 
great antiquity of the religion, because Jains have generally been the most 
highly educated people in India, and due to the recognized integrity of 
the religion. Jains are so respected that some non-Jain temples in India 
are administered by Jains.</p>

<p>While Mahavira, the earliest Jain "teacher" reliably dated lived 
around 600 BCE. He is listed as the 24th. Parshvanatha, the 23rd, is 
held to have lived 250 years before that, but his his historical 
existence is questionable. In the Buddha's day, his followers recognized 
Jainism as already a very ancient religion and Jainism most certainly 
contributed a great deal to Buddhist thought.</p>

<p>There are two major sects of Jainism and several minor ones but the 
differences are not great. Monks of the Digambar persuasion wear no 
clothes because clothes are posessions and increase desire for material 
things. Monks of the Svetambar persuasion wear white robes (nuns of both 
sects wear white robes). Other disagreements among the sects are even 
more minor and not over doctrine but conduct. Temples in the United 
States welcome all sects.</p>
<br>

<h2>General Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Responsibility:</b> &nbsp; Every human is responsible for his/her 
 own actions. Karma is fully implemented.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Compassion:</b> &nbsp; All conscious (five-sensed) living beings 
  have eternal souls, and all souls are equal because all are capable of 
  achieving Moksha (Nirvana, transcendence from the cycle of birth and 
  death). All should be regarded as having near equal worth, though human 
  life is considered the highest form.<p></p></li>

<li><b>God:</b> &nbsp; The universe is eternal and governed by natural 
  laws. There is no supreme being or creator god. There is only the pure 
  soul of each living being: Consciousness, Knowledge, Perception and 
  Happiness.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Rationality:</b> &nbsp; Great emphasis is placed on rational 
  perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Detachment:</b> &nbsp; Attachment to material things and worldly 
  life gathers karma and interferes with achieving moksha (liberation), 
  trapping one in the cycle of birth, death and suffering.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Nonviolence:</b> &nbsp; Jains generally choose professions that 
  respect life and ethical conduct. Doctors, yes; soldiers, no. Monks 
  and nuns walk barefoot and sweep the ground as they go to avoid 
  stepping on insects. In times past Jains wore face masks to prevent 
  accidentally breathing in no-see-ems and monks and nuns often still 
  do.<p></p></li> 
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Specific Rules</h2>

In general Jains are pretty strict about adherence, but some of the rules 
regarding plants (one sensed beings) and no overnight storage are not 
tightly adhered to by laity today. Monks and nuns are expected to follow 
all strictures with great accuracy. This section is an overview of 
important points but for more detail (and more rules) refer to Jain Web 
sites (<a href="jain.html#j01">1</a>, <a href="jain.html#j02">2</a>).

<ul>
<li><b>Night Meals</b> are forbidden because of the many creatures that 
  come out at night and which may be accidentally killed due to 
  poor lighting or attraction to fire.</li>
<li><b>Freshness:</b> &nbsp; Food must be prepared fresh daily. Keeping 
  cooked food overnight is forbidden. Ground spices have an expiry of 
  3 days during rain, 5 days in summer and 7 days in winter.</li>
<li><b>Vegetarianism:</b> &nbsp; Traditionally Jains have been 
  lacto-vegetarians, but modern dairy farming methods, particularly what 
  happens to the male calves (the veal market) has caused many to pursue 
  a vegan diet, eating no animal products.</li>
<li><b>Water</b> is filtered through three layers of cotton cloth before 
  use for cooking or drinking. Water should boiled and cooled before 
  drinking to avoid illness caused by micro-organisms. Illness is thought 
  to engender intolerance.</li>
<li><b>Root Vegetables:</b> (potatoes, carrots, turnips) are forbidden 
  because uprooting a plant kills it (non-violence) and because many tiny 
  creatures may inhabit roots.</li>
<li><b>Beansprouts</b> are prohibited because they are living and eating 
  them kills the whole plant.</li>
<li><b>Cereal Grains</b> are permitted.</li>
<li><b>Fruits:</b> Most are permitted but fruits that bleed milky sap 
  when cut, Jackfruit, for instance, are forbidden. Many Jains avoid 
  fruits that have a red meat-like appearance (tomatoes, watermelon).
  </li>
<li><b>Vegetable Greens</b> are considered marginal because plucking them 
  involves pain to the plant. Most Jains consider greens acceptable but 
  cabbages and other greens where the whole top is cut and the plant 
  thus killed are forbidden.</li>
<li><b>Mushrooms, Fungus and Yeasts</b> are forbidden because they are 
  parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments and may harbor other life 
  forms.</li>
<li><b>Honey</b> is forbidden as the excrement of bees (actually they 
  barf it up).</li>
<li><b>Eggs</b> are forbidden as progeny of five-sensed beings.</li>
<li><b>Cheese and Yogurt</b> are permissible (for non vegan Jains) but 
  must be freshly prepared on the day they are eaten and no animal rennet 
  may be used to make them. Vegetable and Microbial rennet is acceptable 
  but in strict practice only acid coagulated fresh cheese will fit the 
  same day rule. The previous day's yogurt may not be use as a starter 
  the next day.</li>
<li><b>Vinegar</b> is forbidden, it's a product of fermentation 
  (yeast to alcohol then bacterial to vinegar).</li> 
<li><b>Alcohol</b> is forbidden because it may destroy the power of 
  discrimination, create delusions and result in ill health. Also 
  alcoholic beverages are considered non-vegetarian because of FDA 
  allowed additives, some of which are of animal origin.</li>
<li><b>Onions, Garlic, Scallions, Chives and Leeks</b> fall under the 
  category of "roots" the pulling of which kills the whole plant so 
  they are forbidden.</li>
<li><b>Silver Foils</b> common in India as decoration on sweets are banned 
  because the foils are pounded out between layers of bull intestine and 
  are therefor not vegetarian.</li>
