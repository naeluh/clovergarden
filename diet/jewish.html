<h1>Jewish Dietary Law</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Jewish religion includes a strict, well defined set of rules as to 
what foods are "kashrut" or not and how they must be prepared. No reasons 
are given for these rules so what those reasons might have been has been 
debated for centuries.
<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, many of the dietary laws are of rather obscure 
purpose. Some hold  Judaism favors eating only "ideal animals", those 
definitive of their type, in order to be more in tune with God. Since pigs 
and fish without scales do not match the "ideal" for their type they are 
forbidden. This may have been a consideration but does not explain many 
other rules which seem quite arbitrary.</p>

<p>Many authorities suspect a major factor was deliberately making it 
difficult for Jews to socialize with non-Jews. This may have been desired 
by the religious authorities because of earlier problems with Jews slipping 
out of their grasp and fading into the more comfortable non-Jewish 
population.</p>

<p>Today observance of the laws ranges very widely, as evidenced by Jewish 
doctors and media moguls commonly found scarfing quantities of forbidden 
creepy-crawlys in Japanese sushi bars here in Los Angeles. The Conservative 
and Orthodox communities look very much askance at this.</p>

<p>The largest congregation of Judaism in the U.S. is Reform Judaism. 
In 1885 the American Reform Rabbis wrote the Pittsburgh Platform which 
declared kashrut obsolete. This was based on the theory of the time that 
the laws were hygienic in purpose, but that theory has since been 
discredited. Kashrut is now thought to be about identity and spiritual 
integrity.</p>

<p>A large number of Reform Jews still eat pork (probably variable by 
region), but the trend is away from that. The Reform movement's 1999 
Statement of Principles included observance of dietary laws, though not 
with traditional rigidity (compliance is still a completely personal 
matter). One Reform rabbi notes that the cookbooks published by his 
temple included pork and shellfish dishes in the 1920s, shellfish but 
no pork in the 1970s, and neither pork nor shellfish from the early 
1990s on.</p>
<br>

<h2>Specific Rules</h2>

<p>This list is not exhaustive or in sufficient detail to be a complete 
guide to keeping kosher. It is more a guide to persons who have not but 
who have found a need to understand the rules well enough to get along. 
For authoritative detail see the <a href="jewish.html#links"><b>Links</b></a> 
section.</p> 

<p>If serving Jewish guests you need to determine their level of 
compliance in advance so you will not screw up. If you find you are 
dealing with Jews who do keep strictly kosher, give up. Sharing food 
is simply not on the menu. "This behavior is by design".</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Animals</h3> allowed are those with cloven hooves that chew a 
  cud (ruminants). This includes cattle, sheep, goats, deer and and 
  bison. Pigs, rabbits, camels and rock badgers are specifically 
  forbidden. In addition, approved animals must be slaughtered, all 
  blood drained and otherwise prepared in accordance with kosher law, 
  and all under strict rabbinical supervision to be rated "kosher".</li>
<li><h3>Animal Products</h3> from non-kosher animals, including eggs, 
  milk, etc. are forbidden.</li>
<li><h3>Animal Parts:</h3> &nbsp; Some parts of kosher animals are 
  forbidden including organ fats and certain nerves and blood vessels. 
  Removing these nerves and blood vessels is tedious so most slaughterers  
  sell the hind quarters to non-kosher outlets and only kosher the fore 
  quarters. Blood and products made with blood are forbidden.</li>
<li><h3>Meat / Dairy:</h3> &nbsp; Meat (birds or mammals) and Dairy (milk 
  and milk products) cannot be eaten together. Some authorities also 
  include fish as meat. Eggs, fruits, vegetables and grains can be eaten 
  with either meat or dairy but fish must not be cooked with or on the 
  same plate with meat. Utensils used to prepare meat and dairy must be 
  kept separate. There must be a period variously stated as three or 
  six hours between eating meat and eating dairy or vice versa.</li>
<li><h3>Milk</h3> technically must be watched over by a Jew from animal 
  to bottle to make sure it is not mixed with any milk from non-kosher 
  animals. Milk production is so strictly regulated and inspected in the 
  U.S. that most authorities consider it to be kosher without this level 
  of supervision.</li>
<li><h3>Birds</h3> are specifically listed but turkeys were unknown so 
  there is controversy there. Specifically birds of prey and scavengers 
  are forbidden but chickens, domestic ducks and geese are permitted.
  </li>
<li><h3>Insects:</h3> &nbsp; Certain "winged swarming insects" are 
  permitted but positive identification has been lost so all insects are 
  considered forbidden except in a few communities with a tradition of 
  eating certain ones.</li>
<li><h3>Pigs</h3> may not be eaten nor any foods derived from pigs. 
  Unlike Islamic law Jews are not forbidden to farm or sell pigs nor to 
  use leather derived from pigs, just forbidden to eat them. Various 
  reasons have been propose which I summarize on my page 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_pigz.html"><b>Pig - Prohibitions</b></a>.</li>
<li><h3>Fish</h3> must have fins and scales that can be scraped off 
  without breaking the skin. Fish must be purchased whole so it can be 
  positively identified or from a reliable kosher fish market. Kashrut.com 
  has a list of <a href="http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fish/"><b>Kosher 
  and Non-Kosher Fish</b></a>. Some of the kosher fish have barely enough 
  scales to get by, but they have at least a few.</li>
<li><h3>Shellfish</h3> are all forbidden including crabs, lobsters, 
  clams, etc. They come from the sea but don't have fins and removable 
  scales.</li>
<li><h3>Rodents</h3> are all forbidden including rabbit (which is not 
  strictly a rodent by scientific catagories).</li>
<li><h3>Reptiles and Amphibians</h3> are all forbidden.</li>
<li><h3>Cheese</h3> must be manufactured by Jews. Some authorities 
  exempt soft acid set cheeses (farmer's cheese, etc.) but others do not. 
  Kosher hard cheeses are hard to find and very expensive because of the 
  extensive rabbinical supervision required.</li>
<li><h3>Whey</h3> and products containing it are forbidden. Whey is a 
  byproduct of cheese making and non-kosher rennet may have been used.
  </li>
<li><h3>Fruits and Vegetables</h3> can be eaten, but must be inspected to 
  assure they contain no bugs (creepy-crawlys are forbidden).</li>
<li><h3>Grape Products</h3> (Wine, etc.) made by non-Jews are forbidden. 
  Fortunately actually drinkable kosher wines have become widely 
  available in the U.S.</li>
<li><h3>Pareve</h3> is a term used for foods that are neither meat nor 
  dairy nor have they had any contact with meats or dairy nor with 
  equipment used to process meats and dairy. Grains, fruits and 
  vegetables are examples. These foods may be served with either meats 
  or dairy without restriction.</li>
<li><h3>Utensils:</h3> &nbsp; A kosher home must have two sets of pans, 
  utensils, towels, potholders, trivets, spoon rests, etc. - one for 
  meat and the other for use with dairy products. Any mistakes decertify 
  the utensil and a rabbi must be consulted as to whether or not it can 
  be "koshered". All utensils must be washed in a dishpan reserved for 
  their type, never in the sink.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Kosher Certification</h2>

<p>To make keeping kosher easier, there are a number of rabbinical 
organizations that inspect food production and award (or deny) 
certification. Certification is generally identified by a symbol on 
the package the food comes in. 
<a href="http://kosherquest.org/kosher-symbols/"><b>Kosher Quest</b></a> 
has a good multi-national list of certification symbols they consider 
reliable and identify the organizations providing the certification.</p>
