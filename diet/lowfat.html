<h1>Low Fat Diet</h1>
<hr class="hr2">

It seems most major nutrition programs are based on studies that 
are incomplete, cherry-picked, or just plain wrong - just someone liked 
what they said. The Low Fat Diet is based on all of these, plus outright 
fraud. In the 1950s, evidence was cropping up that Sucrose contributed to 
heart disease. In response, from the 1960s on, the Sugar industry bought 
scientists to produce studies that showed fat consumption, not sugar, to 
be the problem (<a href="lowfat.html#l01"><b>L1</b></a>). Unfortunately, scientists 
are even easier to buy than politicians - because they depend on grants 
for survival. Today, the Low Fat Diet is being studied as a leading 
cause of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other aspects of ill 
health.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Executives in the sugar industry wanted to bury evidence that 
sugar contributed to heart disease, and also figured that if people 
ate less fat, they would eat more sugar. This proved very correct.<p>

<p>To this end, in 1965, they hired Harvard scientists to come up with 
a major study that downplayed the role of sugar and named fats as the 
cause of heart disease. When this study was released in 1967, it did 
not mention that financing came from the sugar industry. This 
propaganda program continued through the 1970s and beyond.</p>

<p>To the sugar industry's misfortune, it was not they who most 
benefited, but the High Fructose Corn Syrup industry. With massive 
government subsidies to corn growers, that industry could easily 
deliver more sugars at a lower price than the sugar industry could.
</p>

<p>An interesting side story here is from the American Heart Association, 
the poster child for campaigns based on incomplete, badly designed or 
misleading studies. They based their demonization of saturated fats 
as the causes of heart disease on a highly defective 
study. That study replaced saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats, 
but <u>also significantly reduced sugar consumption</u>. Today, many 
researchers think it was the decrease in sugar consumption that had 
the beneficial effect on heart health, and that polyunsaturated oils 
may be a health risk in the long term.</p>

<p>A new study lead by David S. Ludwig (<a href="lowfat.html#l02"><b>L2</b></a>) 
shows that the low fat diet also contributes significantly to obesity 
and diabetes. Refined carbohydrates are metabolized differently than 
fats. Under the influence of excess insulin, which they trigger, 
calories from carbohydrates are converted directly into fat stored 
in fat cells, and are unavailable for burning as fuel. This leaves 
the body short on burnable calories, so it signals for the person to 
eat more. Of course, if what is eaten is more carbs, it just goes on.
</p>

<p>Today the AHA's campaigns against saturated fats and cholesterol 
are proving misguided at best, and their promotion of trans fats 
instead of natural fats is considered highly damaging, if not 
deadly. High end chefs no longer fear to use bacon and lard in 
their cooking. I expect the next AHA scandal will be the industrially 
produced polyunsaturated fats, which the AHA so eagerly promotes.
