<h1>Macrobiotics</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
With strict rules and prohibitions, and an Oriental mystique the 
macrobiotic lifestyle and diet have attracted a significant following 
of adherents and true believers. While it is difficult to find any 
substantiated medical statements buried under the vast sea of 
enthusiastic promotion, what can be found is not entirely enthusiastic. 
Most dietitians would concede that moderate forms of macrobiotics are 
better for maintaining health than the "Standard American Diet" (SAD), 
but they are also likely to recommend a less restrictive diet.

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2 id="over">Overview</h2>

<p>While the term "macrobiotic" is first known from the writings of 
Hippocrates and further defined by German physician Christoph Hufeland, 
the term is now associated mainly with Japanese educator George Ohsawa 
and his followers, particularly Michio Kushi.</p>

<p>Mr. Ohsawa, who claimed a diet of brown rice, miso soup and seaweed 
cured him of serious childhood illness, brought his macrobiotics plan to 
the U.S. around 1958. While it also includes elements of Oriental 
philosophy and lifestyle, the diet part has received the most attention.
</p>

<p>Michio Kushi expanded on Ohsawa's works and intensely promoted 
macrobiotics in the U.S., founding Erewhon Natural Foods, the East West 
Journal, the East West Foundation, the Kushi Foundation, and the Kushi 
Institute. Together with his wife Aveline, Kushi wrote over 70 books on 
the macrobiotic lifestyle.</p>

<p>Since the more extreme forms of the diet have been abandoned, 
macrobiotics is no longer as controversial as it once was, but medical 
practitioners still recommend strongly against the diet's use by 
pregnant women and young children.</p>

<p>Today the main controversy is over claims that a macrobiotic diet 
cures cancer and AIDS. While several cases have been documented of people 
who recovered from cancer while on a macrobiotic diet it is unknown if 
this represents anything beyond normal remission rates or rates 
encountered with cleaning up the diet in a less restricted way. It must 
be noted that a least some of the people macrobiotics supposedly cured 
were also undergoing conventional therapies. It must also be noted that 
Michio Kushi's wife, Aveline, died of cervical cancer. Information 
regarding macrobiotics and AIDS is much more scant.</p>
<br>


<h2>The Diet</h2>

<p>The objective of the macrobiotic diet is to balance the centrifugal 
and centripetal forces, yin and yang. In the Chinese system all 
foods are rated as to how yin or yang they are. Macrobiotics holds that 
achieving balance is easier with foods that are nearly yin/yang neutral, 
most notably brown rice.</p>

<p>The original macrobiotic diet Ohsawa brought to the U.S. defined 10 
stages, numbered -3 to 7. Stage 7, which consisted only of brown rice and 
water, proved quite dangerous and current practice approximates Ohsawa's 
stages 2 and 3. Stages above 4 are no longer recommended by macrobiotic 
councilors but the theories on which they were based have not been 
abandoned.</p>

<p>Care must still be taken to assure adequate intake of vitamin B12, 
vitamin D, calcium and iron. all of which are relatively scarce in a 
macrobiotic diet. Vitamin B12 will be absent almost entirely if the 
diet form includes no animal products at all (vegan).</p>
