<h1>Mediterranean Diet</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Medical professionals have been intrigued that people in the 
Mediterranean region eat about as much total fat as Americans but have a 
much lower incidence of heart disease. Dietary factors have been and are 
being studied with generally positive results.
<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2 id="class">Overview</h2>

<p>The keys to this diet are simple: plenty of pasta, bread, grains  
olive oil, fruits and vegetables; moderate use of red wine, fish, poultry 
and dairy products; not much red meat.</p>

<p>While clinical tests, particularly with heart and lung patients, have 
been highly positive, there is widespread demand for more studies and more 
rigorous studies, particularly by diet practitioners whose favorite ox has 
been gored.</p>

<p>Now it is true the most promenent study (the Lyon Study) was incomplete 
when it was halted. The reason it was halted was the ethics commitee felt 
the early results demanded bringing the control group in on the deal.</p>

<p>The American Heart Association says the Mediterranean diet is too high 
in fat. Atkins and Paleo say it's unconsionably high in carbs, Zoners say 
it's close but wrong carbs and no tables and calculators. Vegetarians 
say it's cruel to shrimp and Puritans say it tastes too good so it must 
be immoral. I say it's maybe a little shy on the red wine but otherwise 
just fine.</p>

<p>I (and some others) suspect a major keys to the healthfulness of this 
diet is monounsaturated fats (olive oil) displacing trans fats, 
polyunsaturated fats and saturated fats. Also <u>low sugar</u> - 
see our <a href="lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Suggestion: get a couple good Greek, Italian and Turkish cookbooks and 
learn to use them. Resist cherry picking the more American style recipes 
(stick to the plan in the first paragraph above).</p> 

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> &nbsp; noting that I have no medical or dietary 
credentials whatever, I do endorse this diet as providing excellent, 
flavorful and economical meals that many experts consider to be rather 
healthy, but offer no medical advice whatever.</p>
