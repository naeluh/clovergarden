<h1>Raw Foods Diet</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
This is about as restricted as diets can get and still be regarded as 
sane. Many vegetable foods are slightly toxic raw and some are quite toxic 
while most animal foods are just plain dangerous uncooked. The most extreme 
sect is raw food vegans who also reject all foods of animal (or insect) 
origin.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Proponents point out that raw foods must be our natural diet because 
lighting fires became popular only in very recent times. Before that there 
was simply no way to cook anything.</p> 

<p>Anthropologists and paleontologists now strongly dispute this. It 
has been found that fire was not first controlled by humans, but by our 
pre-human ancestors millions of years ago. Many now believe it 
was the more efficient nutrition of cooked foods that allowed pre-humans 
to start evolving large, energy consuming brains. In the mean time, 
our guts became less bulky, as less is needed for cooked food. This 
short gut is unable to properly digest many raw foods.</p>

<p>Beyond the "no way to cook" issue, there is a lot of disagreement 
among the sects, particularly between "idealists" and "realists" as 
well as between "live food" advocates and "juicers". Then there's 
the split between omnivores and vegans.</p>

<p>Proponents of a vegan raw foods diet maintain that our natural diet was 
strictly vegetarian as well as raw. Anthropologists and paleontologists 
firmly deny this was the case. Our ancestors for more than 3 million years 
back ate every bit of animal flesh they could get their teeth on. They 
probably also spent plenty of time splitting open rotting logs and eating 
the grubs, worms and beetles found within - though admittedly eating them 
raw and as "live food".</p>

<p>Raw food idealists claim for it many health benefits. For one thing, 
they point out, there are vanishingly few overweight raw foods dieters. 
They maintain it's a "cleansing" and "detoxification" diet and if adhered 
to religiously is the formula for perfect health and will cure all 
diseases. Others say many raw foodists do not take care of real health 
issues, just blaming them on "insufficient detoxification".</p>

<p>Many practitioners consider the raw foods diet a 100% proposition, 
holding that any cooked foods whatever are damaging and will interfere 
with proper absorption of nutrients from raw foods. Others feel anything 
above 75% raw is just fine.</p>

<p>It is important that raw foods be obtained from organic growers 
and similarly "clean" sources, as exposure to pesticide residue from 
conventionally grown food would be much higher than for most people. 
Foods should be washed thoroughly and carefully.</p>

<p>Care must be take to avoid toxic vegetable foods. For instance sprouts 
from mung beans and similar can be used, but sprouts from kidney beans and 
some other beans are much too toxic raw. Nearly all fresh bean seeds are 
at least somewhat toxic, particularly lima beans and soy beans. Many 
vegetable foods contain significant amounts of cyanide, which evaporates 
with cooking.</p>

<p>Many raw foods enthusiasts consume a large amount of their food as 
juice, because eating that large a volume of whole fresh vegetables is 
less practical. Many of the great apes spend between 4 and 7 hours a 
day just chewing, and still need bigger guts for digestion.</p>

<p>Raw nuts are very important to the raw foods diet because so many 
protein sources are off limits due to toxicity when eaten raw. Among 
nuts, cashews are a particular problem because they are encased in 
highly toxic shells. Most "raw" cashews are actually lightly cooked in 
the shelling process - unacceptable. There is one company in Indonesia 
that has a method of shelling them cold, but at a significantly higher 
price.</p>

<p>Not all raw foods enthusiasts are vegetarian, but raw animal foods 
present some problems. Meats, particularly chicken and turkey, are 
subject to bacterial contamination and other meats may have parasites. 
Fish can be obtained suitable for eating raw, but care must be taken 
there too. For example, salmon, particularly wild salmon, carry 
parasites that can cause painful (though temporary) infections.</p>

<p>Certified raw milk is pretty safe (where available) if consumed within 
a short time, but this would not be part of the "natural diet". Milk 
animals weren't domesticated until long after cooking was established and 
trying to milk a wild buffalo just isn't safe. Raw eggs would be more 
natural and seem pretty safe here in "overregulated California", where 
nearly all cases of illness from raw eggs have been restaurant and 
institution related where egg pooling is used. Red States, not so much.

<h2 id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p>Information in this article is based on many publicly available 
sources. Please refer to our <a href="../ingred/meddisclm.html">
<b>Medical Disclaimer</b></a></p>

<h3>Minerals:</h3> &nbsp; In particular, zinc and copper 
may be deficient. Even some hard core raw foods enthusiasts recognize this 
and recommend supplements.<p></p>

<h3>Weight:</h3> &nbsp; It is true raw foodists are rarely 
overweight. Nutritionists, though, find many to be seriously 
underweight and malnourished. Many female raw foodists are infertile 
and do not menstruate, and many males are also infertile and may 
experience erectile disfunction. Our short guts, evolved for cooked 
foods, are no longer able to extract sufficient nutrition from raw 
foods.<p></p>

<h3>Raw Foods Vegan:</h3> &nbsp; This form combines the 
nutrition problems of both the raw foods and vegan diets, and usually 
includes a level of idealism that rejects supplements and other 
"unnatural". substances. For details, see our <a href="vegan.html">
