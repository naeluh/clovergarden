<h1>Vegetarian</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
There is no reasonable question that one can live and be healthy 
on a vegetarian diet. A major part of the worlds population has lived 
as vegetarians for generations, either by choice or because they couldn't 
afford to do otherwise. Despite what some idealists claim, though, 
vegetarianism is a recent post-agricultural development - our more 
distant ancestors ate any animal, grub or worm they could get hold of.

<h2 id="class">Classes <small>and</small> Types <small>of</small> 
Vegetarians</h2>

<p>There are two broad classes of vegetarians:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Ethical Vegetarians:</h3> &nbsp; These are people who feel, or 
    who's religion teaches, that killing animals is cruel and wrong. 
    Some sects go a mile farther and forbid any exploitation or even 
    inconveniencing of animals, for any purpose whatever. Many of the 
    more extreme ethical vegetarians do not extend these courtesies to 
    people, even though people are animals too.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Health / Aesthetic Vegetarians:</h3> &nbsp; These are people 
    who are vegetarians for reasons other than ethics.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Now lets cut this a different way into types:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Strict Vegetarians:</h3> &nbsp; These are folks who don't eat 
    any animal derived foods. The strictist of the strict are the vegans 
    who consider use of any animal products whatever, for any purpose, 
    highly unethical. See our separate 
    <a href="vegan.html"><b>Vegan Diet</b></a> page for more on that. 
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Fruitarians:</h3> &nbsp; These are another variety of very 
    strict vegetarians, with a number of subclasses depending on 
    exact diet. The most extreme will only eat fruit that has fallen, 
    or would soon fall, from the plant. Others use the botanical 
    definition of "fruit" and eat beans, peas and the like. Most do 
    not eat grains. Frutarians may or may not be "ethical vegetarians".
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Lacto Vegetarians</h3> most exemplified by the Jains of India. 
    To the Jains even no-see-ems are "five sensed life" and not to be 
    harmed in any way.  In times past Jains wore face masks to prevent 
    injuring tiny insects. Eggs, even sterile eggs, are regarded as 
    forbidden life forms, but milk products are permitted. This leaves 
    a huge hole in their philosophy (see next section) which perhaps c
    ould be avoided in the India of times long past, but not now. For 
    this reason, many Jains have been turning to Strict Vegetarianism. 
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Ovo-Lacto Vegetarians</h3> feel it is acceptable to eat eggs and 
    milk products because the animals producing them are not killed 
    or injured (they may be inconvenienced - but so are the rest of 
    us). <u>It is not possible to be both an "Ethical Vegetarian" and an 
    "Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian"</u>. Anyone who doesn't understand why should 
    read our <a href="../ingred/ab_vealcon.html"><b>Veal - 
    Controversy</b></a> page. <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>False Vegetarians</h3> eat fish, sometimes describing fish as 
    "fruits of the sea". Fish are not fruits or vegetables. We, and all 
    other higher animals are descended from fish. All of our 
    characteristics are exaggerations and adaptations of characteristics 
    we inherited from our fishy ancestors. We are of the same flesh, and 
    no-one who eats fish has the right to claim the title "vegetarian". 
    Episcatarian, perhaps?</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p>Today the vegetarian diet and protein requirements are much better 
understood and a whole lot less scary than when I started my vegetarian 
phase, but even back then I had no health problems from it. Of course 
I wasn't a vegan, and I solved the social problems by simply adhering 
to Theravada Buddhist conventions, allowing me to eat whatever I was 
served (provided it wasn't prepared specifically for me) outside of home. 
Records show that people who opt for a vegetarian diet hold to it an 
average of about 8 years - I probably did a little less than that.</p>

<p>Here in California there are now so many ovo-lacto vegetarians 
people are used to them and the social problems are much reduced from 
what they once were. Of course, vegans are still considered pretty 
insufferable by most folks.</p>

<h3>Protein:</h3> &nbsp; When I started my vegetarian phase the 
protein thing was scary. It looked very difficult to assure the U.S. 
recommended minimum. Turned out this "minimum" was so high it was 
dangerous (encouraged by the meat and dairy industries) and was soon 
reduced. It's probably still well above any real minimum.<p></p>

<p>The only real protein deficiency problem normal vegetarians face is 
with a severely unbalanced protein supply. Vegetable sources are 
incomplete (soy is one of the most complete but it apparently has other 
serious problems). Fortunately beans and grains nicely complement each 
other's deficiencies.</p>

<p>Earlier books on vegetarian nutrition say you had to balance your 
protein at each meal, but current thinking is that you have at least 
24 hours and probably a lot longer to balance out. The "protein 
combining" theory was popularized by the first edition of Frances 
Moore Lapp&eacute;'s book <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i>, but has 
never been supported by properly interpreted data, and was withdrawn 
from later editions.</p>

<h3>Vegans:</h3> &nbsp; Of all the classes and types of vegetarians 
who are actually getting <u>enough</u> food, only strict vegetarians 
and vegans (and the frutarian subset and vegetarian raw foodists) face 
serious deficiency problems, particularlly with vitamin B12. For details 
read our <a href="vegan.html"><b>Vegan Diet</b></a> page.<p></p>

<p><h3>Fruitarians:</h3> &nbsp; Persons on this extreme version of the 
vegan diet are just as at risk from vitamin B12 deficiency as regular 
Vegans. The fruitarian diet is considered quite risky for teens, and 
has proven it can be deadly for infants. Some adults seem to get along 
OK though.

<p>Unfortunately long term risk data is very sparce. One notable 
occurance was Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who spent a lot of time on a 
fruitarian diet. It is known that the fruitarian diet can seriously 
disrupt pancreatic function, which can put people in the hospital. This 
happened to Ashton Kutcher, who used the diet while preparing to play 
Steve Jobs in the film <i>JOBS</i>. It is suspected, but not yet proven, 
that this stress can result in a particular rare variety of pancreatic 
cancer, the kind that Steve Jobs died of.</p>
