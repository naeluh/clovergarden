<h1>Zone Diet</h1>
<hr class="hr2">

<span class=bg>Launched by research scientist Dr. Barry Sears with 
publication of his book <i>Enter The Zone</i> in 1995, this diet takes 
a different approach. His aim is hormone balance, with emphasis on 
insulin, the hormone that governs fat storage. It emphasizes a balance 
of 30% protein, 40% carbohydrates and 30% fats, predominantly 
monounsaturated fats.</span>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Zone diet aimed for balance, but while South Beach's balance is 
in tune with official medical doctrine Zone is not. The American Heart 
Association and the AMA denounce it as "high protein" even though only 
30% of its calories come from protein, while proponents of high protein 
diets denounce it as "high carb" and vegetarian promoters lament its 
ratio of protein to carbohydrates. The diet did, however, become 
popular among celebrities and supermodels. As of 2018 it is much more 
in tune with recent nutritional theories.</p>

<p>Dr. Sears holds that the body cannot store fat and burn fat at the 
same time. The burn/storage cycle is controlled by insulin. He says low 
fat diets don't work so well because insulin levels are high and the body 
tries to store any fat it gets hold of. Enough fat is needed in the diet 
to keep that level low so fat can be burned rather than stored.<p>

<p>This balance point is the "Zone" and is said to offer other advantages 
including reduction of inflammation causing factors.</p>

<p>While this diet allows 30% of calories from fats, it is fairly 
insistent that as much as possible be monounsaturated fats. Olive oil 
is the most common source of monounsaturates and also features a very 
low level of rancidity prone polyunsaturates. This is one point just 
about everyone thinks is a good idea.</p>

<p>This diet corresponds roughly to the Mediterranean Diet but with the 
starchy carbohydrates (pasta, bread) replaced with low glycemic 
carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables - and a lot more calculation. 
To follow this diet for maximum benefit requires a book with Zone Food 
Block tables and considerable planning and calculation of blocks to get 
the 40:30:30 ratio right at every meal. On the other hand, for a lesser 
level of benefit you can just follow the general principles.</p>

<p>As an adjunct to the diet Dr. Sears recommends a supplement of fish oil 
for Omega-3 fatty acids and his site offers a specially formulated version 
claimed superior to normal fish oil supplements. As with any other diet 
site various supplements are offered (<a href="zone.html#03">1</a>).</p>
