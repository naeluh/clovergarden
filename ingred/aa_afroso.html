<h1>Afrotheria</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Members of Superorder <i>Afrotheria</i> have an incredibly 
wide range of physical forms, but have been found almost certainly to 
have a common ancestor. The diversity apparently resulted from rapid 
evolution into many niches left vacant on an island Africa by the 
Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction that destroyed the dinosaurs. It is 
thought that living in underground burrows and being able to hibernate 
enabled some mammals to survive.</p>

<p>There are two Clades within Afrotheria, <i>Paenungulata</i> and 
<i>Afroinsectiphilia</i>. We have covered culinary members of both clades 
on this page.  No member of the Afrotheria is kosher.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The <i>Afrotheria</i> evolved from a small mammal in an almost 
vacant island Africa. With few competitors, they evolved rapidly 
to fill a wide range of niches that required a wide range of physical 
attributes. Eventually, Africa attached to other continents, and the 
larger Afrotheres spread far and wide. Meanwhile, an influx of predators 
from other continents forced further rapid evolution. Today, the largest 
Afrotheres have a contracting range, and many are threatened with 
extinction.</p>

<h2>Clade <i>Paenungulata</i></h2>

<p>Members of this clade are notable for their incisor teeth, which 
have, even in the tiny (by comparison) Rock Hyrax, the nature of 
tusks. They also have many more subtle similarities.</p>

   <h3>Elephant</h3>
   <img src="img/aa_eleph01h.jpg" alt="African Elephant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Loxodonta africana</i> (African Bush Elephant) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   <i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i> (African Forest Elephant) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   <i>Elephas maximus</i> (Asian Elephant)]
   <p>
   Elephants are found in patches of Africa, India and Southeast Asia. 
   The earliest known ancestor of Elephants was about the size of a 
   fox, and lived in what is now Morocco. The male African Bush Elephant 
   is the largest, usually weighing in at around 13,330 pounds, but the 
   largest on record weighed 22,000 pounds.</p>
   <p>Elephants have long been eaten by people, particularly in Africa. 
   Today African Elephants, are under great risk from poachers, not 
   for food, but for the illegal ivory trade. Most of this ivory is 
   shipped to Asia. So vicious is this poaching that in 2013 over 1000 
   park rangers were murdered while trying to protect the elephants.

   <h3 id="rock">Hyrax</h3>
   <br><img src="img/aa_hyrax01e.jpg" alt="Live Hyrax" class=mrg>
   [Dassie (Africaans), <i>Procavia capensis</i>  (Rock Hyrax)  &nbsp; 
   | &nbsp;  <i>Heterohyrax brucei</i> (Bush Hyrax) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   <i>Dendrohyrax dorsalis</i> (Western Tree Hyrax) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   <i>Dendrohyrax arboreus</i> (Southern Tree Hyrax)]
   <p>
   Yes, they are closely related to Elephants - they even have little 
   tusks, but not long enough to project out. One variety or another of 
   the Hyrax is found over most of Sub-Saharan Africa, but the Rock Hyrax 
   also extends into the southern mountains of Algeria, along both sides 
   of the Red Sea, and north into Israel. Adult Hyraxes range from about 
   5 pounds to 8 pounds, with the Rock and Bush Hyraxes heavier than the 
   Tree Hyraxes.</p>
   <p>Hyraxes have a host of predators, everything from eagles to snakes, 
   and are also hunted by humans for food, though not intensively. The 
   Rock Hyrax (Dassie) was much eaten by early Dutch settlers in South 
   Africa due to the serious shortage of meat animals available to them. 
   Their guns were too clumsy and ineffective to go after big game. The 
   Rock Hyrax is safe from humans in parts of its northern range because 
   it isn't kosher or halal.

   <h3>Sirenia</h3>
   <br><img src="img/aa_manat01e.jpg" alt="Live Manatee" class=mrg>
   [Sea Cows; family <i>Trichechidae</i> (Manatees)  &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   family  <i>Dugongidae</i> (Dugong)]
   <p>
   These almost entirely vegetarian, fully aquatic animals eat large 
   amounts of water plants, thus are restricted to warm, shallow regions 
   with plenty of vegetation. Manatees are found in estuaries and rivers 
   on both sides of the Atlantic. They inhabit the entire Caribbean 
   region and the Amazon basin deep into the center of South America. 
   In Africa they live along the west central coast and far up the 
   rivers almost to central Africa. A full grown Manatee can weigh more 
   than 3,900 pounds. Dugongs live in waters along the east coast of 
   Africa, including the Red Sea, and through the islands of Southeast 
   Asia. The largest Dugong recorded weighed 2,200 pounds.</p>
   <p>At the time of the Spanish arrival, the natives of the Caribbean 
   region were hunting Manatees for food, and they were similarly hunted 
   in Africa. Today, these animals are legally protected through much of 
   their ranges, but poaching for food is still a problem. The main risks 
   to these animals are from other human activity: ships, boats, fishing 
   nets, oil spills etc. With manatees, damage from ships is very common 
   because they don't hear low frequency sounds well.

<h2><i>Afroinsectiphilia</i></h2>

<p>While it's hard to imagine that creatures weighing just a couple of 
ounces could be fairly closely related to Elephants, the DNA evidence 
is pretty clear. One family (<i>Macroscelididae</i>), not shown here 
because they are all too small to eat, was given the name "Elephant 
Shrews". They were tiny and shrew-like, but with long, mobile noses 
suggestive of elephant trunks. The namers never dreamed they would 
actually be related to elephants.</p>

   <h3>Common Tenrec</h3>
   <br><img src="img/aa_tenrec02h.jpg" alt="Live Tenrec" class=mrg>
   [Tailless Tenrec; <i>Tenrec ecaudatus</i>]
   <p>
   Tenrecs are small insect eating animals native to Madagascar and 
   parts of Africa. This Tenrec, found throughout Madagascar, is much 
   larger than most, growing to 15 inches long and weighing up to 5-1/2 
   pounds. It is covered with fur, but also long sharp spines. It not 
   only eats insects, but also small frogs and mice. It lives in burrows 
   and can hibernate for long periods. Despite the "tailless" designation, 
   it does have a tail, but a very short one.</p> 
   <p>This Tenrec has been taken from Madagascar to other islands in the 
   Indian Ocean, and it is eaten on the island of Mauritius. This is not 
   easy, as it is hard to catch and difficult to prepare properly, 
   especially with all those sharp spines. The Common Tenrec is IUCN red 
   listed LC (Least Concern).

   <h3>Aardvark</h3>
   <br><img src="img/aa_aardv01e.jpg" alt="Live Aardvark" class=mrg>
   [Cape Anteater, African Ant Bear; <i>Orycteropus afer</i> of order 
   <i>Tubulidentata</i>]
   <p>
   The Aardvark is a nocturnal burrowing insect eater that roams over 
   the southern 2/3 of Africa. It avoids rocky areas because it can't 
   burrow there. It is rather large for a burrowing animal, weighing 
   up to 180 pounds. It has a very long snout containing an even longer 
   tongue, coated with stick saliva and used to gather ants and termites. 
   The only other thing the Aardvark eats is the Aardvark cucumber, 
   the only cucumber that matures its fruit underground. The meat, which 
   is similar to pork, is eaten by some African cultures.
   The Aardvark is IUCN red listed LC (Least Concern).
