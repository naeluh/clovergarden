[Center Cut Pot Roast, Chuck Roast Center Cut]
<p>
Named for the slice of shoulder blade bone in the (rough) shape of 
the number "7" (top in photo), this is a popular cut for various uses 
and easily available in markets around here. The actual configuration of 
the bones, and shape of the "7", can vary because several of these are 
cut from a shoulder.</p>
<p>Steaks may be cut to 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, but at 3/4 inch they may 
be called "roasts". While definitely a bit tougher than the premium 
steaks, they also have more flavor. The photo specimen was 9-1/2 
inches by 7-1/2 inches and 3/4 inch thick, weighing 2 pounds.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut is often used for "Yankee Pot Roast" 
and similar. For those uses it should be at least 3/4 inch thick. 
Ok, I confess: when I just want to fry up a hunk of beef, plain and 
simple, this is my favorite cut, at between 1/2 and 3/4 inch. Yes, it's 
tougher than the premium cuts, but has more flavor, and I keep it quite 
rare, so it doesn't have time to toughen up.<p></p>
