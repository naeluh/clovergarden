<p>
Beef Bones can come from all parts of the beast, but those from the shank 
(photo specimen) are particularly good because they include some of the 
most flavorful meat and plenty of connective tissue. These are also very 
easy for the butcher to cut up on his bandsaw. In any case, what you're 
looking for is bones with some meat and tendons on them, and cut or 
broken to expose marrow in the center.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Any meat market should be able to provide plenty 
of beef soup bones. If they aren't on display ask the butcher. Most 
markets will cut up large bones for you on the bandsaw. Be sure to 
specify you want the bones for soup stock, not for your dog.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Wash well to remove saw kerf residue and bone chips. 
If large, you should split them into pieces. Always split lengthwise as 
bone is very hard to split crosswise. Unless you have a lot of practice 
swinging a meat cleaver, place the edge where you want the split and hit 
the back of the cleaver with a heavy soft faced mallet. This will 
minimize pieces of bone flying all over everywhere.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are used to make very good beef stock. Beef 
stock needs to be simmered a very long time, 8 hours is definitely not too 
much. Put vegetables in for only the last hour.<p></p>
