<h1>Beef Brisket</h1>

<h2>Flat Cut</h2>
<br>[k'awi de res (Bolivia); Falda (Argentina)]
<p>
  This is the preferred (and higher price) brisket cut, rectangular and 
  nearly uniform in thickness. It is moderately tough and usually used 
  braised or roasted. The photo   specimen was 8-1/2 x 5-1/2 x 1-1/2 
  inches and weighed 2 pounds 1-1/2 ounces, a fairly small size for this 
  cut.</p>
  <p>These are also made into corned beef, and during the week leading 
  up to St. Patrick's Day they may be on sale, but at a considerably 
  higher price than the Point Cut.</p>

<h2>Point Cut</h2>
<br>[#120B (deckle off)]
<p>
  This is the end of the whole brisket up near the separation between 
  the shank and shoulder. The photo specimen is actually a Corned Beef 
  Point Cut, "Deckle-on". You can see there is a thick layer of fat with 
  a thin layer of meat over it. This is normally removed (deckle-off) 
  for fresh cuts, in which case there would be little fat and the cut 
  would be flatter, more like the Flat Cut, but not so rectangular.</p>
  <p>The photo specimen was 8 x 6-3/4 x 2-1/2 inches and weighed 3 pounds 
  3-3/4 ounces. This is a rather large size for a point cut - but, when 
  corned beef point cuts are on sale the week before St. Patrick's Day, 
  there is usually a 2 package limit, so I buy the biggest ones they 
  have.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Flat Cut Brisket is usually roasted, braised 
or barbecued whole, then sliced for serving. It's shape and thickness 
make it a natural for this sort of use. It is particularly popular 
in Texas for barbecue.
<p>Point Cut Brisket is not common fresh in markets here in Southern 
California, but is sold (along with much more expensive Flat Cut) as 
"corned" (salted) beef, very popular for the U.S. / Canadian St. 
Patrick's Day dish <a href="../recipes/1mm_cornbeefcab1.html"><b>Corned 
Beef and Cabbage</b></a>. This is not an Irish dish (the St. Patrick's 
day celebration isn't Irish either), but the Irish have started offering 
it due to tourist demand. They've even started putting on North American 
style St. Patrick's Day celebrations (formerly all the pubs were closed 
on St. Patrick's Day) - got to keep those tourist dollars rolling in, 
you know.</p>
