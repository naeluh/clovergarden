<h1>Beef Chuck Roll Roast</h1>

[Diesmillo Grueso]
<p>
This moderately priced roast offers an excellent combination of 
meat, fat and connective tissue. It's a bit tougher than the premium 
cuts but has better flavor. Roasted whole, this cut has enough fat and 
connective tissue to keep it moist, better in both flavor and texture 
than round roast, but I most often use it as stew meat.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 8-1/2 x 4-1/4 x 2-3/4 inches and weighed 
3-3/8 pounds. Because they are cut from a much larger wholesale chunk 
of shoulder, chuck roll roasts may vary some in shape, size and amount 
of fat.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is the roast I most often cut into chunks 
to make stews. It takes more preparation than round, but cooks in lest 
time and has better flavor and texture. I use all offcuts to make soup 
stock, so there is no waste.

<p>Yes, the fat goes into the soup pot too, as much of the flavor in fat 
is water soluble. After simmering for 4 to 6 hours, strain the stock and 
defat it using your gravy separator.</p>

<p>Because I don't mind a steak that's a little chewy, and I do my steaks 
quite rare which keeps them tender, I sometimes cut one of these in 
half crosswise, then slice horizontally into steaks. A bit tougher 
than the premium cuts, but with better flavor.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Cut into stew chunks, a 3.3 pound, 8-1/2 x 4-1/4 
x 2-3/4 inch roast yielded 2 pounds 9-7/8 ounces (79%) of clear meat. The 
offcuts are meaty with moderate fat and lots of connective tissue, so 
make a fine soup stock. If you don't have enough offcuts you can freeze 
what you have to combine with more later.<p></p>
