"Beef" includes all members of the <i>Bovini</i> tribe of the 
<i>Bovinae</i> subfamily of family <i>Bovidae</i></span>, and that 
includes Cattle and Yaks (genus <i>Bos</i>), Buffalo (genus <i>Bubalus</i> 
(water buffalo)), Bison (genus <i>Bison</i> (including American 
"buffalo")), and a bunch of lesser known lines.</p>
<p>"Beefs" are pretty much all purpose critters, fulfilling tractor and 
transportation duties in much of the world as well as providing dairy 
products and meat.</p>

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The generally category "Beef" includes Cattle, Yaks, Water Buffalo 
and Bison.</p>

<p>All domestic cattle descend from the wild Aurochs (<i>Bos primigenius 
taurus</i>) with domestication begining somewhere between 10,000 years 
ago and 8,000 years ago. By then sheep, goats, pigs and dogs had already 
been domesticated and were being sheared, milked, eaten and used to 
carry or pull loads.</p>

<p>In Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia "beef" means water buffalo 
and there's little attention paid to particular cuts - you just buy a hunk 
of buffalo of the weight you want. It's all going to be cut into small thin 
pieces anyway because it's all a bit tough and you need to strech it because 
it's expensive.</p>

<p>In Europe and the U.S. where beef means cow, it's cooked in medium to 
large pieces as a feature dish and in various ways so cut is extremely 
important. Prime grilling cuts are so expensive the beef industry has 
recently invented new cuts that can be substituted for the astronomically 
priced ones.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="age" class=lrg>Aging Beef</h2>

<p>Beef is not considered at its best fresh from the animal, it's just 
too tough. This is why beef is not popular in many areas that lack 
refrigeration and why it's boiled in other such areas. With time the 
muscle fibers are digested by enzymes making it more tender. The problem 
here is giving the enzymes time to work without the beef rotting. Two 
aging methods are generally used:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Dry Aging</h3> is done by hanging the carcass, quarter or primal 
cut in a room with carefully regulated temperature and air flow, 
generally for 7 to 20 days. Air flow is necessary to avoid spoilage but 
can't be too fast or the beef will become too dry. This aging process is 
relatively expensive but provides the most "beefy" flavored beef.
<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Wet Aging</h3> is done for nearly all your supermarket beef. 
Cuts are vacuum packed in plastic and the aging takes place during normal 
distribution, transportation and warehousing. At the destination store 
the package is opened and the final cuting and consumer packaging is 
done. Obviously this is a lot less expensive than the dry aging method.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="veal" class=lrg>Veal</h2>

<p>Veal is the meat of a calf, an immature cow. It is pale in color and 
relatively tender compared to beef, with a flavor sort of between pork and 
beef. It is an inevitable  byproduct of the dairy industry.</p>

<p>Veal production has been made highly controversial by animal rights 
advocates using highly emotional campaigns, often misleading or short on 
facts. The veal industry has countered with information campaigns which 
may also be misleading. For more on this subject see our page titled 
<a href="ab_vealcon.html"><b>Veal - Controversy</b></a>.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="who" class=lrg>Who Eats Beef?</h2>

<p>Cattle were domestigated well before the dawn of history, probably 
separately in Africa and Central Asia. Large areas of fertile grassland 
are necessary for raising cattle so it is not popular in heavily 
forested or dry parts of the world.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>India</h3> &nbsp; The sacred Vedas have specific instructions for 
beef, so obviously it was a common comestable in early India. It fell out 
of favor with the rise of Buddhism and the Krishna cult. Now major parts 
of India are vegetarian and the parts that aren't still don't eat cow 
(or don't admit it anyway). In any case, it is economically more 
advantageous to allow cattle to convert indigestible plant material 
into dairy products than to kill them for meat.
<p>The wide use of milk, cream and cheese in India does present a 
troubling ethical delema, especially for Jains and other extreme 
vegtarians. As a byproduct of dairy production, India is necessarily a 
major exporter of veal. They do it quietly, but everyone knows it's 
being done, and that there's no escape from it.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Asia, East, Southeast</h3> &nbsp; Beef is eaten but in relatively 
small quantity compared to pig, except in <b>Mongolia</b> and 
<b>Korea</b> where beef is favored.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Islam</h3> &nbsp; Beef is not forbidden but is not much eaten in 
Islamic regions due to the strong Arabic influence in religion and custom. 
It was not economical or even possible to raise cattle in Arabia, most of 
the Middle East, or post-Roman North Africa - so lamb or mutton are much 
more common.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Jews</h3> &nbsp; Beef is approved by religious law. For 
Orthodox Jews it must be ritually saughtered and processed in accordance 
with the law.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Christians</h3> &nbsp; A powerful sub-cult of the Pagans (a Cult 
of the Dying God), Christians eat whatever they please and beef is a big 
item wherever it can be raised economically.</li>
