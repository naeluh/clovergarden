<td colspan="2">The 
Chuck NAMP #113 (66# to 110#) extend from the neck to the fifth rib

  The Chuck Roll is an extension of the Rib Eye Roast into the Chuck, 
  but the shoulder gets more exercise, so it's not as tender, and because 
  of the shoulder bone structure, it's more complex.  Wholesale Cut: 
  the Chuck Roll 116A (13# to 21#) includes the Chuck Eye Roll 116D 
  (8# to 14#), Chuck Tender 116B (1# to 3#) and Chuck Under Blade 
  116E (8# to 14#).<br>The Chuck Roll Roast is a thick cut across the

  The Chuck Tender #116B (1# to 3#) is a narrow muscle, just above the 
  Chuck Underblade, that superficially resembles the Tenderloin at the 
  other end of the beast, thus the name. The roast is a thick slice 
  across and steak is a thin slice across. This is the tenderest part

  Cut from above the shoulder blade. The roast is a thick crosswise slice. 
  The Flatiron Steak is produced by cutting the roast in half 
  horizontally into upper and lower halves to remove a membrane. This is 
  the most tender of the chuck cuts, and the Flatiron has been the most

  premium cuts.</td></tr>

  These are sold, sawed into chunks, as an economical cut to use when 
  making beef stock. There is quite a bit of meat on them, but it is 
  difficult to remove until well cooked due to the complexity of the 
  bones it adheres tightly to.

  This is the upper portion of ribs 6

  The difference between a Ribeye Roast and a Rib Roast is that the 
  Ribeye is boneless and the Rib Roast has rib bones. This cut comes 
  from the top of the Rib primal cut, with the meat on the outside of 
  the ribs. The bones removed for Ribeye are the Back Ribs (see above).

  This is a special case of the Rib Steak, including a long length of full 
  width rib, Frenched, and with a very thick head of meat. Special 
  considerations are necessary for cooking because of the thickness of the 
  meat, usually 2 inches or thicker.

  Steak, New York Strip Steak, Kansas City Steak, Ambassador Steak, Boneless

  end (starting just behind the 13th rib) to a thick butt end within the

  This steak is a crosscut,

  This is part of the diaphragm muscles and hangs down between the 12th 
  and 13th ribs next to the kidneys.  There's just one per beef, weighing 
  1 to 2-1/4 pounds, and due to its internal position it doesn't show up 
  on beef charts. It is flavorful, but like the skirt steak (another part 
  of the diaphragm) it needs to be cooked briefly with high heat to no more 
  than medium rare. Traditionally butchers kept this cut for themselves.

  Veal tongue differs from beef tongue in being less than 1/2 the weight, 
  more tender and with a milder flavor. They also have a much shorter 
  cooking time and are not trimmed as much at the root end because the 
  FDA considers them not to pose a mad cow disease risk.

  These come in two varieties, "throat sweetbreads" (thymus) and 
  "heart sweetbreads" (pancreas), also sometimes called "stomach sweetbreads". 
  The heart sweetbreads are preferred, and have a roughly round shape. The 
  throat sweetbreads are of a roughly cylindrical shape. They are often 
  cooked together. The photo specimen, a pancreas, was 8 inches long, 4 
  inches wide, 1-1/4 inches thick and weighed 0.9 pound.
