<h1>Short Loin Crosscut Steaks</h1>

<h2>Porterhouse Steak</h2>
<p>
  This steak is a crosscut of the Short Loin, 
  meaning it includes both the Top Loin muscle and the Tenderloin muscle 
  in a single steak. It differs from the T-bone steak in being thicker and 
  including a greater width of Tenderloin (1.25 inches minimum). This is 
  one of the premier charcoal grilling cuts, thus expensive.</p>
  <p>The photo specimen was 7 inches long, 6 inches wide and 1 inch 
  thick, weighing 1.22 pounds.</p>

<h2>T-Bone Steak</h2>
  <p>
  This steak is a crosscut of the Short Loin, meaning it includes both 
  the Top Loin muscle and the Tenderloin muscle in a single steak. It 
  differs from the Porterhouse in being a little thinner and including 
  a narrower width of Tenderloin (0.5 inch minimum). Not a loss in my 
  opinion, the tenderloin, while very tender, is deficient in flavor. 
  This is a highly desirable charcoal grilling cut, thus fairly 
  expensive, but less so than the Porterhouse.</p>
  <p>The photo specimen was 8 inches long, 6-1/4 inches wide and 
  a litt less than 7/8 inch thick, weighing 15-3/8 ounces.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are considered excellent charcoal 
grilling steaks. Of course they can also be pan fried or broiled. 
They should be cooked over very high heat with care taken they are not 
overdone. You don't want to wreck an expensive cut by making it dry 
and flavorless.<p></p>
