[#1100, #1101 (special)]
<p>
This cut can be from any part of the beast except the shanks. It is 
mechanically tenderized by a special machine that dices the meat small 
from both sides but does not cut it all the way through. The cut must 
remain intact when suspended form a point 1/2 inch in from the edge.</p>
<p>For #1100, two pieces may be knitted together or a single thin piece 
can be folded before tenderizing. For #1101 (Beef Cubed Steak Special), 
only meat from the round, rib and chuck can be used. Knitting pieces 
together and folding are forbidden.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 5 inches long, 4 inches across and 0.4 inch 
thick. weighing 1/4 pound, 2013 US $3.99 / pound.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Back in my tender youth, a half century ago and 
before I knew anything about cooking, I used to buy these frozen at the 
local market. I fried them gently in butter and ate them with a sprinkle 
of salt and a very liberal squeeze of lemon juice. Tests with the photo 
samples have shown this still works very well. Of course, these are 
still just a bit on the chewy side, but quite edible.<p></p>
