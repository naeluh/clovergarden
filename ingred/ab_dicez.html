[#135/A/B, Diced Beef, Beef for Stewing, Beef for Kabobs]
<p>
  <b>#135: Diced Beef.</b> &nbsp; This product can be prepared from any 
  part of the beast except shank, detached cutaneous muscles and heel 
  meat. It must be free of bones, cartilage, heavy connective tissue and 
  lymph glands. At least 75% by weight must meet the size specification 
  of at least 0.75 inch and no larger than 1.5 inches, but no piece may 
  exceed 2.5 inches. Fat thickness may not exceed 0.50 inch at any point. 
  Of course, that provided by your local meat market may not adhere 
  strictly to this standard, usually with larger hunks, but that isn't 
  such a problem for home cooks as it would be for a prison kitchen or 
  the like.</p>

<p><b>#135A: Beef for Stewing.</b> &nbsp; This is a little stricter than 
#135. 80% must meet the #135 size specification and fat must at no point 
exceed 0.25 inch thick. The batch from which the photo specimen came 
from met the spec OK except for quite a few pieces exceeding 2.5 inches 
- in fact one piece was a whopping 4.25 inches.</p>

<p><b>#135B: Beef for Kabobs.</b> &nbsp; This one is quite a bit stricter 
than #135. 90% must meet a size narrowed to 1.00 inch to 1.50 inches, and 
no surface may be more than 2.5 inches. Further, surface and seam fat must 
not at any point exceed 0.125 (1/8) inch.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most of the pieces in any of these products 
will be from tougher cuts, so don't depend on them cooking quickley, 
even though cut fairly amall.<p></p>
