<h1>Beef Finger Meat</h1>

<p>
This meat is cut out between ribs 6 through 12 and from under the 
Ribeye Roast. The meat included in these strips is tender loin meat, but 
it is removed from the Roast because it includes a lot of connective 
tissue and is more than a little tough.</p>

<p>This cut will not be found in regular North American super markets, 
but can be had from specialty butchers. The photo specimens were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) that 
carries quite a few meat items unfamiliar to most Americans.
The photo specimens were about 10 inches long, 1-3/4 inches wide 
and 1 inch thick. They were purchased frozen for 2019 US $6.99 / pound.

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Because of its toughness, this cut needs 
either long / hot cooking or needs to be ground. It makes very good 
beef burger patties, preferably blended with some regular ground 
beef.</p>
