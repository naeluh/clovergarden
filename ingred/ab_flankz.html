[Beef Flank; Bavette (Fr); #193]
<p>
This cut is very lean with medium flavor and is medium tough. Despite 
it's toughness, it is not a cheap cut due to its popularity in Mexican 
and Asian cuisines. It is excellent for Fajitas and other Mexican dishes 
that use beef cut into narrow strips and also for Asian stir fried 
dishes which also use narrow strips.</p>
<p>Because it's already thin it needs 
less cutting than most other cuts. The photo specimen was 11 
inches by 7.5 inches and 1-1/4 inches at the upper right, tapering to 
3/8 inch at the lower left, and weighing 2.3 pounds.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For some applications this cut is marinated 
whole, then grilled or broiled with high heat to an internal temperature 
of 145&deg;F/63&deg;C and then sliced very thin. For other applications 
it is sliced thin into strips before cooking. In either case it must be 
sliced across the grain or it will be stringy.
<p>This meat should be minimally cooked over high heat. Braising and 
other slower methods that cook the meat thoroughly will make it tough and 
dry.</p>
