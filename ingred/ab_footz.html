<h1>Calf Foot</h1>
<br><img src="img/ab_calffoot02g.jpg" alt="Whole Calf Foot" class=mrg>
[Pate de Res (Spanish)]
<p>
  An essential ingredient in many traditional soups, including 
  Philadelphia Pepperpot - the soup that saved the American Revolution. 
  These have fallen out of use by Regular Americans as so many wish to 
  avoid any animal part that actually looks like part of an animal. 
  They are easily available in ethnic markets.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in California Calif Feet are found in markets 
serving Mexican, Eastern and Southeastern European, Turkish, Armenian, 
South American, Levantine and Middle Eastern communities, and we have 
plenty of all those. If the feet are whole, have the butcher bandsaw them 
into slices - this service is normal and generally provided without cost.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Feet sold in California are thoroughly cleaned with 
the outer hoof and all hair removed. If you buy pre-cut feet or have the 
meat market bandsaw them into convenient pieces there is no prep except 
a quick wash to remove any saw kerf residue.  If you have purchased them 
whole, use a meat cleaver driven by a heavy soft faced mallet to split 
them lengthwise first and then crosswise.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; When making soup stock you'll want to simmer for 
at least 8 hours, more is better. For <a href="../recipes/tmm_khash1.html">
Khash</a> (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan) 10 to 12 hours.<p></p>
