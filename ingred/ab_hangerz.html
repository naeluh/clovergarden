[#40, Hanger Steak, Bistro Steak, Butcher's Steak; Onglet (French)]
<p>
  This is part of the diaphragm muscles and hangs down between the 12th 
  and 13th ribs next to the kidneys, thus the name.  There's just one per 
  beef, weighing 1 to 2 pounds, and due to its internal position it 
  doesn't show up on beef charts. It is flavorful, but like the skirt 
  steak (another part of the diaphragm) it needs to be cooked briefly 
  with high heat to no more than medium rare. Traditionally butchers 
  kept this cut for themselves.</p>
<p>Some descriptions of this cut attribute it to the Plate cut, along 
with the Skirt Steak, but the NAMP manual associates it with the 
Short Loin, as it hangs quite high in the beast. The photo specimen was 
untrimmed, with fat and membranes in place. It measured 11-1/2 inches 
long, 5 inches wide and 1-1/2 inch average thickness, weighing 
2 pounds 3-1/2 ounces.</p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This cut may have been trimmed by the butcher, 
with fat and membranes removed. If not, trim it yourself. There's a 
tough membrane between the two halves and the halves are usually 
separated before cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is a loose grained piece of meat, 
similar to the Skirt Steak and requires the same sort of treatment 
to prevent it from becoming tough. Grill or Broil with high heat for 
a short time - no farther than medium rare. Slice it crosswise.<p></p>
