<p>
  Beef Hearts are very large, so they are rarely sold whole. The photo 
  example, from an Asian market, appears to be about 1/3 of a whole 
  heart, and with most of the plumbing cut off. It weighed 1 pound 6 
  ounces, and was 7-1/2 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide and 1-3/4 inches 
  thick. Since most Americans don't want to buy any meat that actually 
  looks like part of an animal, most regular markets sell heart sliced 
  about 1/2 inch thick with most of the fat cut off.</p>
  <p>This is muscle meat, and very well exercised, even tougher than 
  shank - simmering time will need to be about 3 hours. Hearts are made 
  of a unique type of muscle, called cardiac muscle. It is a striated 
  muscle like skeletal muscle, but this is not obvious, it looks smooth.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Most Beef Hearts are ground up and included in 
various sausages and similar products, but some do appear in better 
quality meat markets. The price is reasonable because most people don't 
know what to do with them. The photo specimen was purchased from a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $1.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Generally all that is needed is to cut off the 
thick fat at the top and any remaining plumbing on the inside - then 
slice as desired.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Beef Heart needs to be wet cooked for a long 
time, about 3 hours at a simmer, so is used mostly in stews and similar 
dishes.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; With the thick fat cut off, the heart in the 
photo above yielded 91%.  Heart meat purchased sliced may yield about 
95%, depending on how picky you are.<p></p>
