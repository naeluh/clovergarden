[Sirloin Tip]
<p>
  This is usually a wholesale cut, the front side of the leg from hip to 
  knee. #167 has fat on, and #167A, called "Peeled" has the fat off. 
  This cut is divided by the butcher in many ways. It is more tender 
  than the other parts of the round, all of which are from the back 
  side of the leg.</p>
<p>This cut consists of three sections: Tip Center, Tip Side, and 
Tip Bottom. The Tip Center, an oval shaped muscle, is the tenderest 
part of the entire Round and is often cut into Tip Steaks. The tip 
side is has is an oval flattened on one side and has some visible 
connective tissue. The Tip Bottom is irregular and smaller than the 
others. It contains quite a bit of connective tissue so will need 
longer wet cooking.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut can be roasted whole, but most of 
the time it is parted out into smaller cuts, often called Sirloin Tip 
cuts.<p></p>
