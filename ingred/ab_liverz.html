<h1>Beef Liver</h1>

<p>
   A beef liver is very much larger than you probably want for household 
   use, so they are always sold sliced crosswise. Liver is held 
   particularly compatible with onions in just about all beef eating 
   cultures, so it's not easy to find a recipe that doesn't include them. 
   The photo specimen was 11 inches long, 5 inches wide and 1 inch thick, 
   weighing 1 pound 5 ounces.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Liver is still fairly common in meat markets, but 
most available in ethnic markets serving Eastern and Southern Europeans, 
Mexicans and Middle Easterners.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The way they're sold around here there isn't much 
to do except remove a little plumbing, slice and rinse well in salted 
water - unless you need to kosher them.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Liver is usually cut into smallish pieces and 
cooking time is kept very short, as liver tends to toughen with longer 
cooking. This is, of course, impossible with Jewish recipes since the 
liver is already well overcooked by the koshering process (see below).
<p></p>

<h3 id="kosh">Koshering:</h3> &nbsp; If you are using liver in a Jewish 
recipe, this procedure is necessary to reproduce the authentic flavor 
of the dish. If you are Jewish and want to keep "sort of kosher", the 
basic procedure here should do fine, but if you're keeping a hard 
core kosher kitchen there are a lot more details, and you should consult 
a paper by an authorized rabbi. The main point is this: blood is 
forbidden for Jews, and liver is so saturated with blood koshering by 
salt is considered insufficient.
<ol>
<li>If you're really doing kosher, you must buy your liver from a kosher 
  butcher to make sure the animal has been killed and dismantled in 
  accordance with kashrut laws.</li>
<li>If koshering a whole liver (this would be the case with a lamb liver), 
  you need to make sufficient cuts through the outer membrane for the 
  juices to flow through.</li>
<li>The liver may be salted or no. If it is, usually just enough salt is 
  applied for proper flavor in cooking.</li>
<li>Flame is required. Preferably use a gas or charcoal grill with the 
  flame below the grate, but with care it can be done in the broiler. If 
  broiling, use a grate in a pan so that all liquids drain away and 
  cannot touch the liver. In either case, you must roast the liver all 
  the way through, turning once to get it flamed on both sides. There 
  must be no dark brown color in the center. It is not necessary to char 
  the surface, but some recipes do call for that.</li>
<li>The liver may now be cut in whatever way is appropriate to the recipe 
  being used.</li>
<li>Caution: &nbsp; Once a grate, pan, tongs or other tools and utensils 
  have been used to kosher liver, they <u>must</u> <u>not</u> be used for 
  any other purpose nor come in contact with tools used for other 
  purposes.</li>
<li>Caution: &nbsp; If broiling, you must be careful no liquid from 
  the liver splashes on the walls of the broiler or any other part of the 
  stove, or you stove may thereafter be used only for koshering liver. 
  There is probably some rabbinical procedure to restore the stove to 
  general use, but it probably involves sand blasting and a substantial 
  donation to the temple.</li>
<li>Fortunately we Pagans and Christians can disregard the above 
  cautions.</li>
