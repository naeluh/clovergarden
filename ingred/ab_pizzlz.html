<h1>Beef "Pizzle"</h1>
<br><img src="img/ab_pizzle02g.jpg" alt="Whole Bull Dick" class=mrg>
[Bull Pecker, Bull Dick; El Miembro Viril del Toro (Spanish); 
Card&aacute;n (Bolivia ("Driveshaft"))]
<p>
Most people in North America know this item only as dried sticks 
sold as dog chew treats (bully sticks), but, at one time, in the 
American South, they were dried and made into walking sticks (also 
useful for beating slaves). They are not featured by the porn industry 
because bulls are not nearly as cooperative as horses and dogs.</p>

<p>Beef pizzles are now easily available in North America, because any 
large Asian market will have plenty of them in the frozen meat cases. 
They are popular as a "medicinal" item, reputed to improve strength 
and endurance in certain athletic activities that are beyond the scope 
of these pages.</p>

<p>The photo specimen, purchased from a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (Alhambra) was 28 inches long and weighed  11 ounces. 
Cost was 2017 US $7.99 / pound.</p>

<p>While most noted for use by Asians, Beef Pizzle has a similar 
reputation in parts of South America. It is used instead of Tripe as 
the basis for the Bolivian national hang-over cure soup, Caldo de 
Card&aacute;n.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in any large Asian market 
(at least here in Southern California) curled up in foam trays in the 
frozen meat cases.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; These need a bit of attention before you start 
to cook.
  <ol>
  <li>First the Pizzle must be split along the urethra. This can be done 
    with a knife, but some have found it easier to jam one blade of a 
    pair of kitchen shears into the urethra, then just snip from one end 
    to the other.</li>
  <li>At this point, you need to wash it throughly and give it a soak 
    in water to clean the split plumbing.</li>
  <li>Next, there is a tough outer membrane that doesn't cook well. 
    Plunge the Pizzle into a pot with plenty of boiling water for 
    a minute or two. After this the membrane will be firmed up and 
    can be peeled off.</li>
  <li>Give it another wash and you're good to go.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; You want to use a slow cooker here, because 
  Pizzle is very tough and needs to be simmered for 10 hours before it 
  is edible. We hope to have a complete tested recipe for Bolivian 
  <i>Caldo de Card&aacute;n</i> (Driveshaft Soup) on this site soon.<p></p>
