<p>
Cut from the rib area, this is ribs 6 through 12 and some or all of 13. 
The backbone is cut completely away at one end and the other is to be cut 
so the ribs are all between 6 and 8 inches long (though in practice this 
varies). There can be substantial fat on the inside depending on how the 
ribs were cut.</p>
<p>The Rib Eye Roast meat is removed from the outside at the backbone end 
and any easily recoverable meat for grinding is removed from between the 
bones at the backbone end, thus the notches. The ribs become wider and 
flatter as they go down the side and below this cut they are made into 
Short Ribs. Each side shown in the photo was 15 inches long by 8-1/2 
inches at the widest point and weighed 3-5/8 pounds.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are most commonly separated into 
individual ribs and grilled or broiled. Meat is not thick at any point 
so it will be cooked through when well browned on the outside. In the 
broiler, cut them in pairs or threes, partially separated, for stability, 
and finish separating them after broiling.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 3-5/8 pound side was 2-1/8 pounds with 
bones subtracted (59%) but some of that was fat so don't count on more 
than 50% meat.<p></p>
