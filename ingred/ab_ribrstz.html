<p>
The difference between a Ribeye Roast and a Rib Roast is that the 
Ribeye is boneless and the Rib Roast has rib bones. This cut comes 
from the top of the rib primal cut, with the meat on the outside of 
the ribs. The bones removed for Ribeye are the 
<a href="ab_ribbakz.html">Back Ribs</a>.</p>

<p>this is a one of the tenderest roasts you can serve, and easy to slice 
if it is boneless, but, being loin meat, it is not the most flavorful.
</p> 

<p>Rib Roasts can be of substantial size, 3-1/2 to over 18 pounds, 
depending on size of cow and how it is cut. The full Rib Roast can be so 
large it is often cut into two sections, called the First Cut or Small 
End Cut which includes ribs 9 or 10 through 12, and Second Cut or Large 
End Cut which includes ribs 6 through 8 or 9. The photo specimen was 
small and short at 9 x 5 x 2-1/2 inches and 3 pounds 10 ounces.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut is just about always oven roasted 
or cooked by similar means. It may or may not be netted or laced to 
hold it in shape. It should not be overcooked or it will become dry 
and tougher. Given here are temperatures at the center of the roast. It 
should then be let rest for 10 minutes under foil and center 
temperature will rise another 5 degrees.<p></p>
