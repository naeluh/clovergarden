<h1>Beef Short Ribs</h1>

<h2>Flanken Ribs</h2>
<br>[Korean style ribs (thinner)]
<p>
Here in Southern California these are sold as "Flanken Ribs", with 
"Short Ribs" designating the English Style. These were 7-1/4 inches 
long, 1-1/2 inches wide and 5/8 inch thick, weighing 4-5/8 ounces 
each</p>
<p><b>Korean Style Ribs</b> are cut the same way, but about half as 
thick.</p>

<h2>Short Ribs, English Style</h2>
<p>
Here in Southern California these are sold just as "Short Ribs". These 
were 3 inches wide by 3-1/2 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick, weighing 
10 ounces each. The bones were typically 2-7/8 ounces, yielding 7-1/8 
ounces edible (71%), but a 10 ounce piece will be only 8 ounces cooked, 
and the bone will still be 2-7/8 ounces.
</p>
<p>These are far too thick to fry or broil, unless you cut them 
horizontally into bone half and boneless half - but they'll still be 
a bit tough. Braising works well, and they'll be tender in about 1-1/4 
hours.
