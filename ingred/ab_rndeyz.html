<h1>Beef Eye of Round</h1>

[#171C, Cuete (Spanish)]
<p>
This cut consists of a single oval muscle, which is about the tenderest 
part of the Bottom Round. That still isn't all that tender, so salting 
and special slow cooking methods have been developed.</p>
<p>The photo specimen, actually half of an Eye of Round, was 2-1/2 
pounds, 2-3/4 x 5 inches on the wide face and 6-1/2 inches long.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Several methods have been developed to roast 
this chunk of meat and get it tender. Here is one that is reported to 
work well.
<ol>
<li>Rub the roast liberally with kosher salt (sticks to meat better than 
regular salt). Put it in a plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 12 
hours, but 24 hours or more is better. Some recipes do not call for 
this, but it will keep the meat moister.</li>
<li>Bring the roast out and rinse it lightly and dry. Then rub with 
whatever seasonings you like. If you have salted the roast you don't 
need salt in the rub, but the rub should include some olive oil.</li>
<li>Let the roast sit at room temperature for 1 hour so it's not so 
cold. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 500&deg;F/260&deg;C.</li>
<li>Place the roast on a rack over a shallow pan. When you are sure the 
oven is at 500&deg;F/260&deg;C, slide the roast into the center of the 
oven and close the door.</li>
<li>Immediately reduce the heat to 475&deg;F/245&deg;C and roast for 
7 minutes per pound of roast (26 minutes for a 3-1/2 pound roast).</li>
<li>Do not open the oven door. Turn off the oven and let the roast stay 
in there for 2-1/2 hours. DO NOT open the oven door during this time.
</li>
<li>Confirm that the roast has reached an internal temperature of 
145&deg;F/63&deg;C. One of those digital thermometers with a long cable 
that measure with the door closed is very helpful for this operation.
</li>
<li> Bring out the roast. Let it rest lightly tented with foil for 
about 10 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other recipes salt as above, sear all over in a large skillet 
and roast in a 225&deg;F/107&deg;C oven for 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until 
115&deg;F/46&deg;C in the center. The oven is then turned off and the 
roast left in (without opening the door) until the center temperature 
rises to 125&deg;F/52&deg;C.</p>

<p>Yet other recipes follow the first method but add the pan searing step 
from the second method.</p>
