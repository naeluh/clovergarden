[Round Steaks Crosscut]
<p>
This is a slab cut from the big end of the round, cut #166A or similar. 
It includes the Top Round, Bottom Round and Eye of round. For clarity, 
the Top Round is at the bottom of the photo. This is a very lean but not 
very tender cut, so it's best for recipes that call for the meat to be 
cut into thin pieces or that use a long moist cooking method. If it's 
less than 3/4 inch thick it can be called a "steak". 
</p>The photo specimen was 14 inches wide, 10 inches high and 1-3/4 
inches thick, weighing 7.3 pounds.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is a tough cut for applications where 
the meat is cut into thin strips, or where long moist cooking is applied, 
or both.
<p>I would never serve this thing to guests fried, broiled or 
grilled, but the flavor is good and I don't mind a steak that fights 
back, so I have broiled it for myself now and then.
