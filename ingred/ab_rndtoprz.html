[London Broil]
<p>
  This is the inside leg muscle, opposite the Bottom Round. Top Round 
  Steaks are thick slices cut crosswise from the roast. Thinner slices are 
  called simply Round Steaks. The Top Round Steak is sometimes called a 
  London Broil, but that is the name of a menu item, not a cut, and it is 
  more commonly from the Flank.</p>

<p>This cut is very lean. Though not as tough as the Bottom Round, it 
is not a tender cut. Taking a thick "steak" like this and grilling it 
or broiling it, well, you'd better have a sharp steak knife and strong 
teeth. The photo specimen, labeled as Top Round - Lond Broil, was 10 
inches long, 6.5 inches wide, 1-1/4 inches thick and weighed 2 pounds 
12 ounces.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut is best for braise or simmer, though 
a particularly tender piece can be slow oven roasted. It can also be 
sliced thin and then into narrow strips which are marinaded and stir 
fried for Asian dishes.
<p>When used for London Broil (a preparation completely unknown in 
England) it is first marinated for several hours, then seared over 
very high heat (grilled or broiled). For serving, it is sliced very thin 
across the grain.</p>
