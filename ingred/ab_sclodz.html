<h1>Beef Chuck Shoulder Clod Roast</h1>

<br>
<h2>Cross-rib Roast</h2>
<br>[Cross-rib Roast, Boston Cut, English Cut Roast, English Roll, 
Bread and Butter Cut]
<p>
Cut from the shoulder, this moderately priced roast is flavorful but 
somewhat tough, though not as tough as round. It'd be a bit chewy cut 
into steaks and fried or broiled, but it is fine for cutting into chunks 
for stew, or for any long cooking method such as braising or roasting. 
The photo specimen was 6-1/2 x 3.0 inches across the face, and 6-1/2 
inches long, weighing a little over 3 pounds. It was boneless and had 
almost no fat. 2007 US $3.69 / pound.</p>

<h2>Shoulder Clod Roast</h2>
<p>
This is the same as the Cross-rib Roast except cut into slabs about 
3/4 inch thick. The photo specimen was 10 inches long, 5 inches wide 2 
inches thick and weighed 3 pounds.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut can be roasted or braised whole. The 
connective tissue melts into the meat keeping it moist.
<p>The slabs can be cut into chunks for stews. Offcuts are low in fat, 
meaty and high in connective tissue, making them excellent for soup 
stock, If you don't have enough, you can freeze the offcuts to combine 
with more later. The fat goes in the pot with the other offcuts as much 
of the flavor in fat is water soluble. After simmering 4 to 6 hours, 
strain the stock and defat it using your gravy separator.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The 3.0 pound slab photo specimen, after cutting 
into chunks for stew, removing all fat and membranes, yielded 2 
pounds 3-5/8 ounces clear meat (74%). Since all the offcuts are fine 
for soup stock, there is no waste. If roasted whole, yield on the plate 
will be very high.<p></p>
