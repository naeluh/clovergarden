Center cut Beef Shanks (photo specimen) are great for beef soups and 
stews. They include plenty of the most flavorful meat on the beast, and 
plenty of connective tissue for a rich stock. The bone is cut in slices 
exposing the marrow, and very little of your money goes for fat.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are plentiful in just about any ethnic 
market and often even appear in supermarkets. Unfortunately the meat 
markets are quite aware of the great properties these shanks posses, so 
it's worth shopping for a good price.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Wash well to remove saw kerf residue and bone 
chips. Depending on your use, you may just want to cut up the shanks and 
toss everything into the stock pot for a very strong stock. In other 
cases you may want to separate the meat for stew, and use the rest to 
make stock. If the bones are large, you may want to split them. Place 
the edge of your meat cleaver where you want the split and hit the back 
of the cleaver with a heavy soft faced mallet. This will minimize pieces 
of bone flying all over everywhere.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 3 pounds 7 ounces tray of meaty shanks (similar 
to the photo but with somewhat bigger bones) yielded 1 pound 10 ounces of 
clear stew meat (47%), 12-5/8 ounces of marrow bones (23%), of which 
2-7/8 ounces was actually marrow (5%), and 1 pound of fat, tendon and 
unrecoverable meat (30%).<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; the 30% fat and offcuts plus the 23% marrow bones 
all goes into the stock pot. Yes, the fat too, much of the flavor in fat 
is water soluble. When you have simmered for a few hours, strain out the 
solids and remove the fat using your gravy separator.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The meat from shanks is the finest stew meat, 
tough with plenty of connective tissue, but it needs long cooking, even 
longer than bottom round.<p></p>
