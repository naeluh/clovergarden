<p>

  This cut seems to vary in interpretation. Some vendors claim theirs are 
  from the Top Sirloin, but it seems more official that they are one of 
  the cuts from the Sirloin Tip, or Knuckle (See Round). This cut has 
  very good flavor and is quite moderately tough.</p>

<p>The photo specimen was 8 inches long, 3 inches wide and 7/8 inch 
thick, weighing 8.9 ounces. It was stupidly priced at 2013 US $9.99 / 
pound, but if you bought one tray you got another "free", so the 
effective price was about $5.00 / pound.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is another cut that should be grilled 
or broiled over very high heat so it is almost chared on the outside 
and quite rare on the inside, and then is sliced thin crosswise. I have 
also sliced these in half horizontally and pan fried them successfully. 
They were a little chewy, but not at all disturbingly so.<p></p>
