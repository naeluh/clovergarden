[Trimmed Tip Steak, Ball Tip Steak, Kabob Meat]
<p>
This is a roast cut from the Knuckle, the front side of the back leg.  
It is more tender than other parts of the round, but slow cooking is 
still recommended. Some stores I know also cut the knuckle into Sirloin 
Tip Steaks. These are made quite thin to compensate for toughness. One 
store cuts them about 1/8 inch thick, which makes them difficult to fry 
without them getting overcooked and dry. The other cuts them even a 
little thinner, but lays them out so each steak is made up of two slices 
which are fried together. This is a better plan, keeping the meat moister 
but still thin enough to eat.</p>
<p>The photo specimen, a sirloin tip roast, was 9-1/2 inches by 6-1/2 
inches and 1-1/2 inch thick and weighed 2 pounds 10 ounces, purchased 
at 2014 US $2.99 / pound (on sale).</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is a little more tender than the other 
roasts from the round, but the same slow cooking methods are in order.
