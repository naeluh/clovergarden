<h1>Beef Skirt Steak</h1>

<p>
This lesser known cut is favored for fajitas, stir fry, Bolognese 
sauce, and Iberian and South American cuisines, as well as in 
fancy restaurants. It is flavorful with a loose texture that takes 
marinades very well.</p>
<p>The Outside Skirt, also known as the Diaphragm Skirt, is sold almost 
entirely to restaurants. The Inside Skirt, considered slightly less 
flavorful, can be found in some markets. The top photo specimen, an 
Outside skirt, was 17 inches long, 2-3/4 inches wide and 0.35 inch 
thick, weighing 8-3/4 ounces. They can range from 16 to 24 inches 
long.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This cut is usually purchased from specialty 
meat stores rather than in supermarkets. The outside skirt can be 
found at markets that also sell direct to restaurants. &nbsp; 
<b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Supermarkets often sell Flap Meat labeled as 
Skirt Steak. While these two may be interchangeable in Tex-Mex 
usage, the much thinner flap meat is not suitable for other uses.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Membranes are almost always present on the 
outside skirt and may be present on the inside skirt. They must be 
removed, but usually you can just pull them off with little trouble.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This meat is generally either cooked very 
fast over high heat, or braised for a fairly long time. In between 
it will be tough. After cooking it is generally sliced thin across 
the grain. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; because this cut is so 
loose in texture, heat penetrates very quickly so it's easy to overcook.
