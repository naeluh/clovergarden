[New York Strip, Kansas City Strip, Shell Steak, Club Steak]
<p>
  Cut from the Short Loin, this is like a Crosscut (Porterhouse, T-Bone), 
  but stops at the bone and includes no meat from the tenderloin side. 
  All the names above are for the exact same cut, #1179 (bone in) and 
  #1180 (boneless). The "Club Steak" name is also used for other steaks.
  #1179A and #1180A are the same thing but "Center-Cut".</p>
<p>Being a loin steak, this cut is quite tender, but not as flavorful 
as the tougher cuts. The photo specimen was 7-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 1 inches 
and weighed 14-1/2 ounces.</p>

<p>Note that "Vegas Strip Steak" is not at all related to this cut. 
It is from the Chuck (shoulder) and was developed for (deceptive) 
marketing purposes.</p>
