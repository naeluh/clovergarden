<h1>Suet / Tallow</h1>
<br><img src="img/ab_suet03g.jpg" alt="Lump of Suet" class=mrg>
<h3>Suet:</h3> &nbsp; This is fat from around the kidneys of a bovine 
(the name is also used for similar fat from sheep). It is very high in 
saturated fats, thus firm, flaky, solid at room temperature and very 
desirable for many cooking applications. Suet is most often rendered 
into tallow, the cow equivalent of lard, but is still used directly in 
cooking, particularly for many of the best English dishes.<p></p>

<h3>Health:</h3> &nbsp; In North America, suet is most known as food 
for winter birds, because of the AHA's (American Heart Association's) 
incessant campaign against saturated fats, particularly animal fats, as 
heart killers.
<p>The recent enthusiasm for the Atkins Diet pretty much blew this out 
of the water - people on that diet failed to die, or even to show any 
of the symptoms claimed by the AHA. In fact, recent studies with rats 
(and demographics in China) show that saturated fats protect the heart 
from the ravages of canola oil (and other mustard seed oils).</p>
<p>The "healthy" trans fats and polyunsaturated fats the AHA urged us to 
use instead, are far and away more dangerous, to the point the FDA is 
considering banning trans fats outright. Polyunsaturated fats may be 
a major contributor to Type II diabetes, and their rapid rancidity is 
suspected to contribute to cancer - scandals in the making.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3> &nbsp; Observant Jews are forbidden to consume 
suet or tallow, because these are reserved to be submitted to God as 
burnt offerings at the temple, for his exclusive enjoyment.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While widely available in England, in 
North America, suet for human consumption can be had only from specialty 
meat markets. The photo specimen, weighing 1 pound 10 ounces, was 
obtained from Harmony Farms, a specialty retail / wholesale meat market 
here in La Crecenta, California. To quote the meat man, "Nobody else has 
this, but if you need more for the holidays, we will have it".<p></p>

<h3>Tallow:</h3> &nbsp; This is fat rendered from suet, exactly as lard 
is rendered from pig fat. It is not readily available in markets, but 
it is very easy to render it from suet, as I did for the photo specimen 
below. For methods of rendering suet into tallow, see our 
<a href="ap_lardz.html">Lard</a> page - it's done exactly the same 
way.<p></p>

<h2>The Tragedy of Tallow</h2>

<p>Not long ago all the fast food restaurants deep fried in beef tallow, 
a safe, high temperature (400&deg;F/200&deg;C) frying fat with good 
flavor and so durable a vat would only have to be replaced about once 
a month.</p>

<p>Then the AHA mobilized the Do-gooders against this "deadly animal fat", 
and a massive campaign was launched urging the fast food industry to 
stop using tallow in favor of "healthy" vegetable oils (actually highly 
processed seed oils not found in nature, like corn, soybean and canola 
oils).</p>

<p>The fast food industry decided they had to conform to this demand - so 
they studied the recommended vegetable oils. These were found totally 
unusable. These oils became rancid and stinky within just a few hours at 
frying temperatures. The fact that many products of rancidity are 
suspected carcinogens was probably not a consideration, but smell and 
taste certainly were - and the cost of replacing the fry oil every few 
hours, not once a month, was economically non-viable.</p>

<p>The fast food industry turned to the only option available at the 
time - deadly trans fats. These had the durability of beef tallow, but 
were approved by the Do-gooders and the AHA, because they were made by 
further processing of the already highly processed seed oils. The taste 
wasn't as good, so McDonalds (and probably others) turned to artificial 
beef flavors added to their fries to make them acceptable.</p>

<p>Now, they have to give up trans fats, which may soon be banned 
completely by the FDA. They cannot return to relatively safe, economical, 
good tasting beef tallow because the Do-gooders will scream in rage. The 
whole basis for the AHA's campaign has been shown entirely invalid, but 
the Do-gooders "know what's good for you" - it'll be at least another 
half century before the damage is undone.</p>

<p>So, the industry must turn to the only option left - an option not 
available when they went to trans fats - highly processed seed oils 
from GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) seeds, which emulate the 
health characteristics of olive pomace oil (olive oil is too expensive 
for the fast food industry, and there is insufficient supply). This brings 
up a whole new realm of possible long term health problems.</p>

<p>Incidentally, in England, fish and chips are still fried in good old 
beef tallow. Clearly, they are short of Do-gooders over there. We 
should send them ours.
