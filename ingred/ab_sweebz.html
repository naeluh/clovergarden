<h1>Veal Sweetbreads</h1>

[Mollejas de Res (Spanish)]
<p>
These come in two varieties, "throat sweetbreads" (thymus) and 
"heart sweetbreads" (pancreas), sometimes called "stomach sweetbreads". 
The larger, oval shaped heart sweetbreads are preferred by fancy 
restaurants, so it is the elongated shaped throat sweetbreads we can 
buy in markets here in Southern California. The two can be 
cooked together if both are available, and they taste pretty much the 
same. The photo specimen, a thymus, was 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, 
1-1/4 inches thick and weighed 0.9 pound.</p>
<p>Sweetbreads are a highly superior (not just in my opinion) substitute 
for beef brains in any recipe calling for those. Brains are mostly 
mushy cholesterol, and carry a minute risk of mad cow disease.</p>

<p>Mild, tender sweetbreads in flavorful sauces were once popular all 
over North America and most of Europe, but today are served mostly 
to connoisseurs in fancy restaurants. They are still popular in 
Mediterranean and some other ethnic cuisines, and are well worth 
your attention</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You won't find these in your average supermarket, 
but ethnic meat markets, particularly those serving Latin American or 
Near Eastern communities may have them. You will generally find only the 
thymus as the pancreas fetches a higher price in the fancy restaurant 
trade.
<p>The photo specimen was bought from a large multi-ethnic market here in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel). It was packed in a plastic tub, but other 
markets may have them in sealed vacuum pack bags or on a shrink wrapped 
foam tray. In regions without ethnic markets you will have to order from 
a specialty meat market, probably at a higher price. Buy them well before 
the expiry date and cook them right after purchase as organ meats are 
quite perishable (and market expiry dates tend to be over-optimistic).
</p>
<p>Some "gourmet" recipes call for "milk fed veal sweetbreads", but we 
don't have those around here. They're probably all sent to fancy 
restaurants in New York and San Francisco, where they can fetch an 
outrageous price. Here in Los Angeles, world center for ethnic cuisines, 
we're fine with more robust flavors.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; After soaking, par boiling and pressing as shown 
below, you will have about 46% of the weight as bought. Recipes almost 
always give the weight "as purchased" and expect the weight loss. Yield 
may be a little higher if all these steps are not followed.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The way they're sold around here, sweetbreads 
are pretty much ready to go, so step 1 may not be needed.
<ol>
<li>Trim off any extraneous stringy stuff. Many recipes say to par boil 
  them about 3 minutes, chill, and remove the external membranes, but 
  those sold around here are pretty much ready to go with the membrane 
  already removed.</li>
<li>Soaking is optional, and is only to give the sweetbreads a lighter 
  color, which I don't consider at all critical. If you do, rinse them, 
  then soak for about 4 hours in lightly salted water or milk. Milk is 
  said to get the best results but I've never used it nor thought it 
  necessary.</li>
<li>If you will be dry cooking (grilling, frying, broiling), you want 
  to do this initial wet cooking to firm up the sweetbreads. Recipes 
  that go straight into broth to be cooked may not call for this. Place 
  in a saucepan with cold water to cover well. Squeeze the juice of 2 
  lemons into the pot and toss the sliced peels in too. Add 1 T salt. 
  Bring quickly to a boil, then simmer slowly for about 10 minutes. 
  Some recipes call for vinegar instead of lemon, and the amount of 
  lemon may vary.</li>
<li>Chill immediately and thoroughly under cold running water or in 
  ice water.</li>
<li>Pressing is optional, but it gives the sweetbreads a firmer 
  consistency so they are easier to slice neatly. Without it they may 
  be a little spongy. Pat them dry and place on a plate. Place another 
  plate on top. Put this assembly in the refrigerator and top it with 
  a large jar of pickles or a similar weight. Let them sit there for 
  4 hours, or a little more. The ideal pressed thickness is about 3/4 
  inch.</li>
<li>The sweetbreads are now ready to use in any recipe.</li>
</ol>
