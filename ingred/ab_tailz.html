<h1>Oxtail</h1>

[#1791; Colita der Res (Spanish)]
<p>
While this cut was originally the tail of a steer or ox (a bull with his 
balls cut off to greatly improve his disposition), today it can also be 
from a cow. Oxtail was once considered food for the poor, but today is 
quite expensive, valued for its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The main use for oxtail is in soups, where it's gelatinous nature 
provides body. This characteristic is particularly essential in mock 
turtle soup, but is used in many other soups and stews worldwide. It is 
no doubt even eaten in India, though India likes to pretend beef is not 
eaten there.</p>
<p>Whole oxtails vary from 2 to 4 pounds each, so when a recipe calls 
for "one oxtail", 3 pounds is a good bet. The photo specimen was 19 
inches long and weighed 3 pounds, purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2017 US $3.99 / pound. The largest piece 
in the photo weighed 9 ounces, the smallest 2-3/4 ounces, but pieces 
weighing less than an ounce are sometimes included in a tray of 
pieces.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; It pays to keep an eye on your local meat 
markets, because the cost of oxtail can vary as much as a few dollars 
per pound. On the same day (in July 2017) I saw trays of cut tail from 
$3.99 / pound (on sale) to $7.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Because oxtail, at least here in California, is 
almost always sold already skinned and jointed, there is no prep. Even 
rinsing off saw kerf is not needed as they are generally cut with a blade.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking time is usually 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 hours. 
After cooking, the meat is most often removed from the bones and the 
bones discarded. Some recipes call for serving "on the bone", but in 
either case the flesh should easily and cleanly scrape off the bones. 
Aromatic vegetables and seasonings are often included during the long 
cooking, and in most cases, are discarded with the bones. The soup is 
then finished using fresh vegetables and the meat added back near the 
end of cooking. In some cases, the overcooked vegetables become part 
of the sauce.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The best substitutes are Beef Shanks and the 
much less costly beef neck bones, but they are imperfect substitutes. 
More tender cuts of beef definitely will not serve.<p></p>
