<h1>Beef Tenderloin</h1>
<br><img src="img/ab_tloin03i.jpg" alt="Full Beef Tenderloin" class=mrg>
[Beef Filet; Filet de Boeuf (French)]
<p>
This is a "premium cut", from which restaurants derive many of their most 
profitable (and fancily named) dishes. It is taken from the loin area, 
inside the ribs and just below the spine near the aft end of the beef, 
just forward of the "round" (the beef's tush). This muscle is very lean, 
but gets less exercise than any other muscle in the beef, so it is 
naturally tender. It also has the least beefy flavor, making it suitable 
for showing off the chef's sauces.</p>
<p>The photo specimen is cut IMPS/NAMP #190A, full tenderloin with all fat 
and side muscle removed. Note the "wing", the crosswise piece at the right 
end (the iliacus muscle) is not included in the classic recipes but cut away 
for some other use. The thick end (to the right) is the aft end and called 
the "butt" end. This specimen was 25 inches long, 1-1/4 inches thick and up 
to 3-1/2 inches wide, not counting the "wing". It weighed 2.46 pounds, 
about average,</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Mail order houses sell USDA Prime cuts from the 
tenderloin for up to 2009 US $80.00 / pound (usually shipped frozen). Some 
experts consider "Prime" a waste of money for this already tender cut and 
are perfectly happy with "Choice", and even "Select" wouldn't be bad. 
Supermarkets sell Choice for between $14 and $20 per pound. Discount 
warehouses are reported to sell at under $10, but that's for IMPS/NAMPA 
#189 (no A) which means they haven't had the fat layer removed. To compare 
to #189A prices you have to multiply the warehouse cost by 1.5 and then 
figure your labor.
<p>The ethnic markets I normally shop at sell tenderloin at the butcher's 
counter for around 2019 US $7.99 per pound, but the U.S. grown 
photo specimen was from the floor cases at an Asian market in Alhambra. 
It was still in the shrink wrap as shipped from the meat packer. The 
price was 2009 US $2.99 / pound, and the USDA grade was probably 
"Standard", since there was no visible fat in the meat and it was sold 
without a USDA grade. Flavor was quite good though, and the meat decently 
tender. Keep in mind the USDA grade indicates nothing more than the 
amount of fat marbled through the meat. Select and Standard are leaner 
and Prime is very fatty (only about 2% of American beef is fatty enough 
to rate Prime).</p>
<p>Which cut number you buy (see next section) depends on usage. 
Unfortunately your local market will not have their cuts conveniently 
identified by number, but you should be able to figure it out from the 
descriptions below.</p>
<p>The #189 
will cut into steaks (#1189) with a surround of fat which you can trim to 
the thickness you desire. The #189A steaks (#1189A) will have very little 
fat, but more than the #1190, and will be a bit larger because the 
side muscle is still on. These two cuts are fine for simpler recipes. 
The #190/190A cuts are best for the more refined recipes and will have 
just about no external fat at all, but they will be smaller. These cuts 
are desired by fancy chefs so the fat doesn't interfere with the taste 
and texture of their sauces.</p>


<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; 
The preparation effort depends on the cut number you have purchased and your 
intended use. It can range from removing fat and silver skin to just making 
a few cuts. For the classic cuts you will remove the "wing" so the tenderloin 
looks like the diagram below. Reserve the wing for other uses.

<p><b>#189</b> needs all the external fat removed, but most of this usually 
  pulls off easily by hand. Then remove the "silver skin", the membrane 
  around part of the main muscle. I've found this is easy to pull off in 
  shreds once you cut it free at one end. 
<br><b>#189A</b> has all fat removed but needs the silver skin removed. 

<br><b>#190</b> is the same as #189A except the side muscle (psoas minor, 
parallel to the main psoas major) has been removed.
<br><b>#190A</b> has had both the side muscle and silver skin membrane 
  removed.
<br><b>#191</b> is the Butt Tenderloin with fat, same condition as #189.
<br><b>#191A</b> is #191 but fat removed as for #189A.
<br><b>#191B</b> is #191A but with the silver skin removed.
<br><b>#192</b> is the Short Tenderloin, fat on as for #189.
<br><b>#192A</b> is the Tenderloin Tips. The side muscle may or may not 
  be included.

<h2 class=lrg>Cuts:</h2>

The standard American cuts are shown in the diagram. They are somewhat 
variable, because the Chateaubriand section may be longer or shorter or 
absent entirely, the entire thing can be cut into Tournedos (also called 
Tournados or Medallions). Technically, Chateaubriand is a recipe for a 
tenderloin roast, not a cut of meat. In restaurant practice any portion of 
the tenderloin can be called "Tournedos".<p></p>
<p>French practice is a bit more formal. While American butchers tend to call 
the entire tenderloin "Filets Mignons", the French reserve 
<i>Filets Mignons</i> for only a few slices at the small end of the <i>filet de 
boeuf</i>. Beyond that you 
have <i>Tournedos</i>, then <i>Chateaubriand</i> for the thicker center 
section and finally <i>Biftek</i> at the <i>tet de filet</i>, the big 
end.<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Because of their small size Tournedos and other 
cross cuts of tenderloin are presented two to a serving. They are generally 
cut 1-1/2 inches thick or a little more and weigh between 3 and 4 
ounces. They may be tied around with string to hold their shape. Also, 
because this cut is so lean, a strip of bacon may be wrapped around before 
tying with string. Tournedos are just about always served with sauces 
(a different sauce for each of the two in fancier restaurants).
<p>Tenderloin should not be cooked beyond medium rare, or you're just 
wasting your money. If you want "well done", fry hamburgers.</p>
