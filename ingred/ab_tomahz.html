[Cowboy Steak]
<p>
This is a special version of a Rib Steak (#1103) including the full width of 
a rib bone, Frenched, and a considerable length of it. The meat is thick, 
1-3/4 inches minimum, and the whole cut weighs between 35 and 60 
ounces. The photo specimen was 13-1/2 inches long, the meat was 2-1/2 inches 
thick, and it weighed 2-1/2 pounds (40 ounces). It was purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2021 US $8.99 / pound.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This  very thick cut takes special cooking. Here is 
how to do it on a charcoal grill. Other methods need to imitate this method.
<ol>
<li>You must have a really good probe thermometer to get this right - see our 
  <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html"><b>Kitchen Thermometers</b></a> page.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill. Start a full chimney starter of charcoal. When 
  fully burning (charcoals coated with gray ash) pile the coals at one end 
  of the grill. Wait until it is good and hot.</li>
<li>Just before placing on the grill, season the Tomahawk both sides with 
  Pepper and Salt.</li>
<li>Place the Tomahawk on the grill as far away from the coals as possible. 
  Close down the lid.</li>
<li>Turn the Tomahawk fairly often to make sure it's cooking evenly.</li>
<li>After about 15 minutes, start checking the temperature at the center of 
  the meat. When it reaches 95&deg;F to 100&deg;F (35&deg;C to 38&deg;C) 
  take it off the grill, cover with foil and let it rest for about 15 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile start another chimney starter of charcoal and add it to the 
  charcoal already burning. You want it all really hot now.</li>
<li>Take the foil off the Tomahawk and place over the hot coals until well 
  seared, about 1 minute, then turn it over and sear the other side, and 
  finally the fat edge.</li>
  </ol>
