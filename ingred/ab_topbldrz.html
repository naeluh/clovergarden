  Cut from above the shoulder blade. The roast is a thick crosswise slice. 
  The Flatiron Steak is produced by cutting the roast in half 
  horizontally into upper and lower halves to remove a membrane. This is 
  the most tender of the chuck cuts, and the Flatiron has been the most 
  successful of the "New Steak" cuts.</p>

<p>The photo specimen, a Flatiron Steak, was 13-1/2 inches long, 4-1/2 
inches wide and 1-1/4 inch thick for the thick half and 1/2 inch thick 
for the thin half. Weight was 1 pound 13-1/8 ounces. This made reasonably 
tender steaks.</p>
  
<p>The purpose of the "New Steaks" is, of course, to separate consumers 
from their money. The traditional well known steaks have become so 
expensive beef consumption has been falling, even as carcass costs 
continue to rise. Marketeers are attempting to come up reasonably tender 
steaks from the tougher sections of the beast, because they can be sold 
at a lower price than the well known ones. That price is, however, higher 
than that for ground beef, which is what much of these sections might 
otherwise end up as.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This cut, at least the photo specimen, has 
a problem. For half the length it is about 1-1/4 inches thick and 
for the other half 1/2 inch thick. It really needs to be cut into 
two halves and the halves cooked separately. If the thick half is 
more than 1-3/4 inches it should be split in half horizontally into 
two equal halves.<p></p>
