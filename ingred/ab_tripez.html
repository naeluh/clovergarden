<p>A cow has four stomachs. The stomach walls of the first three are commonly 
sold as "tripe" and the fourth less commonly so. Some Americans hold tripe 
to be disgusting, but there are many famous recipes for it and its 
popularity is world-wide.</p>
<p>The most famous American tripe dish is <b>Philadelphia Pepper Pot</b>, 
said to have saved the American Revolution when Washington's army was 
starving at Valley Forge. In keeping with other famous tripe soups and stews, 
it should be made with a calf's foot. Mexican <b>Menudo</b> is perhaps the 
tripe dish most familiar to Americans and is famed as a hangover cure (tripe 
and calf foot have this reputation in a number of countries).</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Tripe tends to be rather rare in 
chain supermarkets, but is very common in ethnic markets serving Asian, 
European, Mexican, South American, and Near and Middle Eastern 
communities. A specialty meat market should also be able to supply it.

<p>Unlike the tripe described in older cookbooks, that sold in North 
America today is thoroughly cleaned, parboiled and bleached, so it's 
pretty much ready to go.  As purchased, it should have almost no odor.
</p>

<p>Buy the type of tripe appropriate to your recipe. Generally rustic 
recipes are happy with Blanket Tripe, the more refined prefer Honeycomb 
Tripe. Book tripe is not so commonly used but has a unique texture and 
mingles well with sauces.</p>

<p>A cow has four stomachs, each providing a distinct form of tripe:
<ul>
<li><h3>Blanket Tripe</h3>, also known as flat or smooth tripe, double 
  tripe (obsolete) or gras double (French), comes from the first stomach, 
  the rumen. This is the lowest cost tripe and is fine for most soups and 
  stews.</li>
<li><h3>Honeycomb Tripe</h3> comes from the second stomach, the 
  reticulum. It is preferred for more delicate dishes or where holding 
  sauces well is desired.</li>
<li><h3>Book Tripe</h3>, also known as leaf or bible tripe, comes from 
  the third stomach, the omasum. It is less common than the other two 
  but provides a unique double texture, thick and thin.</li>
<li><h3>Reed Tripe</h3> comes from the fourth stomach, the abomasum, but 
  is rarely seen in American markets due to its glandular nature. It is 
  called for in some traditional Italian recipes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Role Tripe</h3> is an 18th century term no longer used and nobody 
seems to know exactly what kind of tripe it designated.<p></p>

<h3>Green Tripe</h3> is tripe fresh from the cow and may be olive 
green, gray or brown. In this condition it's ugly, crusty, smelly and 
unappetizing, though dogs like this form best. Cleaning green tripe is 
a real hassle and is described in cookbooks from early times. The tripe 
sold in North American markets has already been thoroughly cleaned so 
you don't have to do that, unless you're disassembling your own cow.
<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; You will end up with less than half the 
weight you started with, as little as a third for honeycomb tripe. Recipes 
should give the starting weight unless explicitly stated otherwise, such 
as calling for "cooked tripe". Unfortunately many cookbook writers are 
very sloppy about things like this - they presume the whole world does 
everything the exact same way they do (British cookbooks are particularly 
bad this way).  If there are no instructions to cook the tripe in the 
recipe, its a good bet the weight is for already cooked tripe.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking Procedure:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the tripe thoroughly and remove any fat that may be attached 
  to it.</li>
<li>Place the tripe in a pot with cold water to cover. Add some 
  <b>Citric Acid</b> or <b>Lemon Juice</b> to the water along with a 
  teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil for a few minutes, then drain and 
  rinse the tripe.</li>
<li>With fresh water, acid and salt, repeat the above step.</li>
<li>Clean the pot. Return the tripe to the pot and add fresh cold water 
  to cover. Bring to a boil and and simmer until tender but still 
  "al dente", especially if it will be cooked much more in the recipe. 
  &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Sample the 
  tripe as it cooks, because cooking time depends not only on type, but 
  also on degree of pre-processing. Tripe I've purchased from a large 
  Hispanic  market in Los Angeles (Burbank) required rather short 
  cooking. Normal cooking for cleaned and par-boiled tripe (as usually 
  sold here in Southern California) is about 2-1/4 hours for Blanket 
  Tripe down to 1-1/4 hours for Book Tripe. It should still be a bit 
  chewy, but not too much. </li>
<li>Cut the tripe to whatever size and shape the recipe calls for.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've read complaints about the odor of cooking tripe on Internet 
discussion boards. I don't know where they got their tripe, but that we 
have in Southern California has almost no odor as purchased and only a 
light and not unpleasant odor when cooking.</p>
