[#185D, #1185C/D (steaks), Santa Maria Steak, Newport Steak, Triangle 
Steak, Culotte (not quite correct)]
<p>
  This is an elongated, triangular cut from the bottom of the Sirloin 
  adjacent to the Flank and Round. The Tri-Tip steak is cut crosswise 
  from this section.</p>
<p>This cut is very popular all along the West Coast, centering in 
Santa Maria, 170 miles north of Los Angeles, but is not well known 
in most of the country.  In New York, Florence Prime Meats has 
popularized this cut under the name "Newport Steak", named for the 
triangular logo on a pack of Newport cigarettes.</p>

<p>Supply is limited because there are only two of these per beast. 
The photo specimen was a Tri-Tip Roast, untrimmed (#185C). Untrimmed 
means the membrane and fat (on the back side in photo) have not been 
removed. This one measured 12 inches long, 7 inches wide at the big end 
and 2 inches thick at the thickest point, and weighing 2 pounds 3 ounces 
after fat and membrane were removed</p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If this cut is purchased "untrimmed", there 
is a membrane covering one side (the outside side as part of the 
beast) with a layer of fat over it. This should be removed before 
cooking. The NAMP guide shows #1185C and $1185D cut about 3/4 inch thick 
across the grain as steaks before cooking, but that isn't much done 
around here.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Here in California this cut is generally 
given a flavorful rub, then grilled whole over very high heat so it's 
almost charred on the outside and still rare on the inside. It is then 
sliced about 1/4 inch thick.<p></p>
