<h1>Veal Breast</h1>

<p>
  The Veal Breast region is equivalent to the combined Brisket and 
  Plate region of the beef chart. The Veal Breast, because of its much 
  more manageable size, is treated entirely differently from the beef 
  brisket. It is usually sold bone-in, and, though just roasting it works 
  fine, it is a favorite for stuffing. This is done by partially 
  separating the meat from the bones and slipping the stuffing in 
  between.</p>

<p>The photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches long, 7 inches wide and 2-1/4 
inches thick. It was purchased for 2012 US $2.49 per pound, probably 
on sale, 'cause I'm real cheap.<p>

This is a view of the veal breast roast from the bone side. It should 
be cut quite flat on this side.

This is another view, bone side down, showing a view of the end where 
the stuffing separation would be made.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; I'm not a big one for real fancy, so I 
usually just roast this thing as is, pull the bones, slice it and 
serve with a pan juice sauce. Most recipes call for stuffing it before 
roasting. Most veal recipes are Italian, because veal is very popular 
there.<p></p>
