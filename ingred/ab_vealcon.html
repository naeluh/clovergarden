<h1>Veal - Controversy</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>While veal is the primary focus of this controversy, it applies 
equally to sheep and goats when they are raised for milk production. 
Here are the facts that show why it's impossible to be both an ovo-lacto 
vegetarian and an "ethical vegetarian" - If you want to be a vegetarian 
you must chose one or the other.</span>

<p><b>Veal</b> is the meat of a calf, an immature cow, and an inevitable 
byproduct of the dairy industry. To keep milk cows giving milk they must 
be made pregnant and produce a calf once a year. Female calves are raised 
as part of the herd and sent to work in the milk mines when mature. Half 
the calves are male, which makes them less desirable for milk production.
</p>

<p>Dairies have no use for male calves. They used to need one bull to 
knock up the milk cows once a year, but now they get their bull in a 
bottle to save the expense and danger of maintaining the ill tempered 
lout.</p>

<p>You can't have more than one bull even if you wanted to - they'd spend 
the entire day trying to kill each other. That's natures way, survival of 
the biggest, meanest and most ill tempered.</p>

<p>You could cut their nuts off and make steers of them, which 
would greatly improve their temperament, but that still leaves a serious 
problem. These are dairy cattle, not beef cattle. They won't bulk up fast 
enough to be economical and the meat won't be properly marbled. You just 
can't afford to raise them because dog food meat doesn't fetch a 
sufficient price - and that solution wouldn't satisfy the ethical 
vegies anyway.</p>

<p>The only thing a dairy farmer can do is sell the male calves off to 
veal producers where they will be sent to slaughter before puberty brings 
on the bad disposition. And that is where controversy comes in.</p>

<p>Animal rights advocates, most of whom have never met a live bull and 
don't know and have little interest in the facts above, claim veal calves 
are mistreated. They say the calves are kept under inhumane conditions, 
fed a diet deliberately imbalanced to make them anemic and shot through 
with dangerous hormones and drugs. The veal industry denies all this and 
says veal calves are well treated and tested for any medicinal residues.
</p>

<p>Who's telling the truth? Probably neither.</p>

<p>Animal rights advocates have a deserved reputation for making false 
and misleading claims, using photographs of undisclosed date and province, 
and for shrill emotional appeals short on logic. Industry advocates, with 
an obvious economic interest, are also noted for exaggeration and 
misleading statements, though under much stricter scrutiny by government 
and press. Here are statements from the veal industry 
(<a href="ab_vealcon.html#v10">V10</a>) and a representative advocate site 
(<a href="ab_vealcon.html#v13">V13</a>).</p>

<p>The "Veal Crates" touted by anti-veal advocates are now illegal in 
most developed countries - a thing of the past - but are still heavily 
used by advocates for their propaganda effectiveness. The objective of 
most of these advocates is not better treatment of veal calves, but to 
promote veganism - where people use no animal foods or products whatever, 
and do not inconvenience animals in any way.</p>

<p>In any case, the treatment problem is partially resolved by the 
current increase in interest by leading chefs in grass fed veal, industry 
efforts, and state and federal regulations regarding care of veal 
calves.</p>

<p>I certainly agree that veal calves should be kept under humane 
conditions for their short lives, but veal production will not stop or 
decline so long as people buy and consume milk, yogurt, butter, cream 
and cheese. By the time a calf is born it's already got a lot of money 
invested in it so it doesn't make sense to just kill all the males right 
then and there and toss the carcasses into the garbage.</p>
