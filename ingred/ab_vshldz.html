[Beccerrito (Spanish)]
<p>
  Veal Shoulder is of a much more manageable size than a Beef 
  Shoulder, so it is often sold as a whole cut, or, more usually, 
  boneless. It is quite tender, but, as with many tender cuts of 
  various beasts, flavor is not its strong point. Flavorful sauces 
  are in order.</p> 
  <p>The Veal Shoulder Steak is the veal equivalent of the Beef 7 Bone 
  Steak, with the same configuration. The photo specimen, a veal shoulder 
  steak, was 9 inches long, 7 inches wide, 1-3/8 inches thick and weighed 
  2.11 pounds, 2010 US $2.99/# on sale.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most commonly, a whole boneless veal shoulder 
is formed into a roll and tied to keep its shape. It is commonly 
seared, then braised with a flavorful sauce. The veal shoulder steak is 
also usually seared and braised with flavorful sauce elements to make up 
for it's rather light flavor. The most common veal shoulder recipes are 
Italian.<p></p>
