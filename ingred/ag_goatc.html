<p>
There are no official cuts of goat in the United States, it simply hasn't 
been popular enough that any official organization wanted to standardize it, 
so meat cutters here informally follow a pattern standardized in Australia, 
if they follow anything at all. In the ethnic markets here in Los Angeles, 
goat is often given a single price, regardless of cut.

  <td><img src="img/ag_rand03c.jpg" alt="Random chunks" class=mrg>
  Goat is often sold in this form here in Los Angeles, cut into random 
  chunks, cut from any part except the higher value leg. The bone structure 
  of the chunks can be a little complex making deboning a hassle, but the 
  price can be fairly low - in 2012 I've bought these for US $1.99/#. The 
  bones and trimmings make very good soup stock for use in recipes. Meat 
  yield will be between 34% and 54% depending on how much fat is on the 
  pieces.

<tr><th class=tbl rowspan="2">Leg</th>
  <td class=nw>Shank End</td>
  <td><img src="img/ag_leg04c.jpg" alt="Leg, Shank end" class=mrg>
  This cut is the meatiest and least difficult to disassemble for meat, but 
  there's a bit more complexity and bone than you'd expect from the photo. 
  The knee is right in the middle of it.
  <br>The photo specimen was 7 inches wide at the 
  cut end, 4 inches high and 9 inches long, weighing 3.2 pounds. Yield was 
  2 pounds 1 ounce clear meat (64%) and 9 ounces bone, the rest being fat.
  </td></tr> 
  <tr><td class=nw>Loin End</td>
  <td><img src="img/ag_leg08c.jpg" alt="Leg,Loin end" class=mrg>
  This cut includes the split backbone leading to the tail (top right edge 
  in the photo, half the pelvic bone, and the pelvic end of the leg bone. 
  It also includes a lump of interior fat (center in photo) and a thick 
  blanket of fat on the outside (underside in photo). This makes it difficult  
  to disassemble for clear meat and the yield is relatively low. The photo 
  specimen weighed 5.8 pounds and yielded 2 pounds 3 ounces of clear meat 
  (38%) 13-1/2 ounces of bone and the rest was fat.

  <img src="img/as_spleen02c.jpg" alt="Lamb Spleen" class=mrg></a>
  Goat Spleen is quite popular in India, especially Tamil Nadu, but not 
  much available in North America. Lamb Spleen, usually labeled "Lamb 
  Melts", are identical in appearance and cooking properties to Goat 
  Spleen, so are an excellent substitute (the photo is of Lamb Spleen). 
  For details, see our <a href="as_spleenz.html"><b>Lamb Spleen</b></a> 
  page. </td></tr>

  <img src="img/as_nuts01c.jpg" alt="Lamb Testicles" class=mrg></a>
  Goat Nuts are unlikely to be found commercially in North America, 
  but <a href="as_nutz.html"><b>Sheep Nuts</b><a> are pretty common 
  in markets serving various ethnic communities here. Sheep and Goats 
  are so closely related there should be no significant difference. 
  The photo is of sheep nuts, shipped frozen from New Zealand.
  </td></tr>
<tr><th class=tbl rowspan="1">Fat</th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td>Goat fat turns solid at a fairly high temperature - I've measured 
  88&deg;F/31&deg;C on the surface of solid chunks. It has a smoke point 
  around 370&deg;F/188&deg;C, but in tests frying potaoes I did not 
  particularly like the favor or frying characteristics.
