[C&aacute; cu&oacute;ng (Viet); Maeng da, Malaeng da (Thai); {Alukap 
(Ilokano); Obus (Visayan)} (Philippines); Giant toe biter; 
<i>Lethocerus indicus</i> of family <i>Belostomatidae</i>]
<p>
This large insect is usually between 2.6 and 3.1 inches long, but 
reported to grow to as long as 5 inches. It is native to South and 
Southeast Asia and southern China. It is a strong flier and swimmer, 
and a fierce predator, preying on frogs, lizards, turtles, and other 
vertebrates. It kills them with an injection of powerful toxins.</p>
<p>These toxins liquify the victim's flesh so the bug can suck it out 
of their skin. Bites on humans are extremely painful, but humans are not 
liquified. These bugs are popular food items in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, 
and the Philippines. They are so popular in Thailand, large quantities 
are imported from surrounding countries. Farming is difficult because 
of their food requirements, and they can be cannibalistic if over crowded.

<h3>Eating:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia, female Giant Water Bugs are 
boiled or roasted, often seasoned with lemon grass, lime juice, herbs 
and salt. They are served whole. They have a taste described as like 
shrimp or scallops, with overtones of black liquorice.
<ol>
<li>Buy cooked Giant Water bugs.</li>
<li>Pull off the inedible wings and legs.</li>
<li>Break off the head end, just in front of the wings.</li>
<li>Suck out the contents of the main body.</li>
<li>Pick out the contents of the head end and eat it.</li>
<li>Discard the shell.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Products:</h3> &nbsp; Males of the species are roasted and pounded 
well, then used for <i>Nam Phrik Maeng da</i>, a sauce of dried red 
chilis, onion, garlic, and the bugs. Shrimp Paste, Fish Sauce and 
Tamarind may also appear in this sauce.<p></p>
<p>It is the pheromones (sex attractants) of the males that provide a 
unique taste and aroma. For convenience, extracts of the male insect 
are also used in Thailand and Vietnam. Because the genuine Essence has 
become very expensive, artificial Water Bug Essence is now available.
