Here we have lumped together three of the four groups of 
<i>Arthropoda</i> that have members used for human food. The fourth 
group, the much more edible Crustaceans, will be found in our 
<a href="seashell.html">Shellfish</a> section. In the photo to the left 
is a praying mantis, a highly modified predatory cockroach. Nobody eats 
praying mantises (that I know of) but people do eat cockroaches.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>When our first land living ancestors crawled out of the water, insects 
were the food that allowed them to thrive and adjust to living on land. 
Cockroaches, which grew to three feet long back then, were particularly 
important. We ate so many of them they had to get smaller so they could 
hide, and to this day they scurry away from us.</p>
<p>Much more recently, grubs (insect larvae) were probably a major and 
fairly easy to find comestible for our pre-human forms in Africa. For 
certain, insects of various kinds were something we ate regularly.</p>
<p>While the strict Jewish food laws forbid eating creepy-crawlys of 
any other kind, certain locusts are an exception. Basically this was an 
"eat them or die" situation after the clouds of locusts ate everything 
else.</p>
<p>Eating insects became quite common in Mexico, particularly in Hidalgo 
and Oaxaca states, and also in Central America. Available meats were 
few and too expensive for the common people, but insects offered a 
very high amount of easily available protein and fats. This practice has 
continued, even after the Spanish invasion brought pigs, cattle, goats 
and sheep, and to the current day.</p>
<p>Today, there are a number of nutrition activists promoting a return 
to eating insects, as easily produced and sustainable sources of 
nutrition, with minimal environmental impact. The edible insects are 
very high in protein and nutritional fats, and also rich sources of 
vitamins and minerals. These activists also claim they are tasty and 
can be prepared in many ways.</p>
<p>Actually, everyone eats insects, whether they know it or not. 
The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) allows 149 insect fragments 
per 100 grams (3-1/2 ounces) of wheat flour (but no live insects). For 
chocolate it's 59 insect parts per 100 grams, and other foods have 
similar or higher limits. It is simply not possible to eliminate insects 
from the food supply.</p> 
<p>Personally I haven't tried the insects listed below. They are not 
sold in the markets I shop at here in Los Angeles, and are ridiculously 
expensive ordered on the Internet. Besides, there's just so much else to 
eat that I haven't tried yet - but I will soon try the silkworm pupae.

<h2>American Cockroach</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_cockam01d.jpg" alt="Fresh Cockroach" class=mrg>
[Water Bug (USA); Payplaneta americana]
<p>
This winged roach is the bug of choice for cockroach farmers. In China 
this is a fast growing and very profitable industry. These are actually 
native to Africa, not America, but they have come to infest much of the 
world. They grow to an average body length of 1.6 inches and live as long 
as 2 years, though 1 year is more typical.</p>
<p>A typical cockroach farm has millions of these guys. When they have 
grown to maturity, they are vacuumed up and poured into boiling water. 
They are then scooped out, drained and set out to dry the same as if 
they were chili pods. They are sold mainly to cosmetics and pharmaceutical 
firms which grind them up for raw material - though most are a bit 
secretive about all this. Some roaches, however, are fried whole and 
served with salt as an appetizer.

<h2>Bamboo Worm</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_bamb01e.jpg" alt="Deep Fried Bamboo Worm Larva" class=mrg>
[Non mai phai (Thai, lit. "bamboo worm"), Rot duan (Thai, lit. "express 
train"); <i>Omphisa fuscidentalis</i>]
<p>
This moth lays 80 to 130 eggs at the base of a fresh bamboo shoot in 
August. The larva hatch and cooperatively bore a hole into the bamboo. 
Next they bore an exit hole for when they are adults. Then they start 
feeding on the soft pulp inside the bamboo. Strangely, this doesn't 
hurt the bamboo, but makes it stronger. These moths live in northern 
Thailand, northern Burma, Laos and parts of Yunnan, China, and their 
larva are considered a delicacy throughout that region. They are usually 
eaten deep fried. The photo specimens have been fried and are set out for 
sale in a market in Bangkok, Thailand.

[Xamoes; rhinoceros beetle; Families <i>Cerambycidae</i>, 
<i>Scarabaeidae</i>, <i>Melolonthidae</i>, <i>Passalidae</i>]
<p>
These are the grubs (larva) of large beetles that feed on the mesquite 
trees. About 88 species of beetle grubs are eaten in Mexico. They are 
most eaten in the Mexican state of Hidalgo, but also in other states in 
the region including Oaxaca. They need to be well toasted or they are 
bitter, but, once toasted, are said to taste similar to pork rinds. The 
photo specimens, well toasted and for sale in a market in Tula, appeared 
to be about 3/4 inch long.

<h2>Chapulines</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_grshop01h.jpg" alt="Fried Grasshoppers" class=mrg>
[Grasshoppers <i>Sphenarium purpurascens</i>]
<p>
These grasshoppers are much liked in Oaxaca, Mexico, where markets display 
heaping baskets of them. They are also eaten in the region around Mexico 
City, including Puebla and Hidalgo. This grasshopper also lives in 
Guatemala, so is probably eaten there as well. They are available from 
May to August. After a thorough cleaning they are roasted on a clay 
comal and seasoned with garlic, lime juice and salt flavored with 
extract of agave worms. Harvesting these grasshoppers both protects 
crops and provides substantial income to farm families.

<h2>Chilocuiles</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_magu01h.jpg" alt="Live Red Worms in Market" class=mrg>
[Gusanos rojos. Chinicuiles, Tecoles; Red worms; 
<i>Comadia redtenbacheri</i> obs. <i>Hypopta agavis</i>]
<p>
This is probably the most eaten insect in Mexico, the caterpillar (larva) 
of a moth. It infests the Maguey plant (<i>Agave americana</i>), the 
plant from which the distilled alcoholic spirit mezcal is made. Some 
brands of mezcal contain a worm, usually gusanos rogos, but some use 
a much less edible worm that is the larva of a weevil, because it's 
cheaper.</p>
<p>This fleshy worm, which can be up to 2.7 inches long, is highly 
nutritious and has been part of the Mexican diet probably for thousands 
of years. They are most popular in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, 
a bit north of Mexico City. Sometimes they are eaten alive, but most often 
they are fried or braised, seasoned with salt, lime juice and chili 
sauce, and rolled up in a tortilla. They are said to taste something 
like sunflower seeds, but juicier.

<h2>Cicadas</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_cicad01h.jpg" alt="Deep Fried Cicada Grubs" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Cicadidae</i>]
<p>
About 2500 species of Cicadas are known to science, and there are 
probably more. They live in tropical and temperate climates and are 
widely eaten around the world, including in China, Mexico (particularly 
in Hidalgo), Burma and Congo,  The photo specimens were deep fried in 
Shandong, China,

<p>
Crickets are a popular culinary insect in many parts of the world, They 
are particularly liked in Thailand and Cambodia, where street vendors 
present big metal pans heaped high with fried crickets (Chingreit thot). 
The photo specimens are obviously from a fancy restaurant where they 
fetch a higher price neatly presented.

(Ilokano); Obus (Visayan)} (Philippines); Giant toe biter; 
<i>Lethocerus indicus</i> of family <i>Belostomatidae</i>]
<p>
This large insect is usually between 2.6 and 3.1 inches long, but 
reported to grow to as long as 5 inches. It is native to South and 
Southeast Asia, and southern China. It is a strong flier and swimer, and 
preys on frogs, lizzards, turtles and other vertibrates. It kills them 
with an injection of powerful toxins. These bugs are popular food items 
in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and the Philippines.

[Mexican Caviar; <i>Liometopum apiculatum</i> and 
<i>Liometopum occidentale</i>]
<p>
These are the pupae and larva of a couple of species of ant that build 
large nests among the roots of agave plants. In size they are a bit 
larger than cooked short grain rice grains, and taste buttery and nutty 
with a texture similar to cottage cheese. They are eaten most commonly in 
the Mexican state of Hidalgo, a bit north of Mexico City, and in Mexico 
City itself. They probably have been eaten there since long before the 
time of the Aztecs. The photo specimens were cooked in butter and served 
on a plate with a green sauce, tortilla chips and a coarse salsa.

<h2>Mealworms</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_meal02e.jpg" alt="Stirfried Mealworms" class=mrg>
[<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>]
<p>
These familiar worms, the larva of a black beetle, are available in most 
pet stores, for use in feeding captive reptiles, fish and birds. They are 
normally less than 3/4 inch, but growers use juvenile hormones to keep 
them from maturing, and they may grow to over 3/4 inch long. The photo 
shows mealworms with bok choy and chilis, stir fried and served by a 
restaurant in Yunnan, China.

<h2>Meocuiles</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_meoc01h.jpg" alt="Fried Maguey worms" class=mrg>
[Gusano del maguey blanco, Maguey Worm; <i>Aegiale hesperiaris</i>]
<p>
This is the caterpillar (larva) of a butterfly called the Tequila Giant 
Skipper. It infests the plants <i>Agave tequilana</i> and <i>Agave 
americana</i>), the plants from which the distilled alcoholic spirits 
Tequila and Mezcal, respectively, are made.</p>
<p>This worm is highly nutritious and has been part of the Mexican 
diet, probably for thousands of years. They are eaten most commonly in 
Mexican state of Hidalgo, a bit north of Mexico City. The photo 
specimens have been cooked and were served on a plate with a green sauce.

[See <a href="ai_mopanez.html"><b>Other Names</b></a>; <i>Gonimbrasia belina</i>]
<p>
Millions of the indigenous peoples of Southern Africa depend on these large 
moth caterpillars for protein in their diets, but in other parts of the region 
they are a popular delicacy or snack. They are picked by hand, mainly by women 
and children, and are usually salted and dried. Commercially they are canned 
in brine, or with tomato and chili sauce.

<h2>Silkworm Pupae</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_silkw01h.jpg" alt="Roasted Silkworm Pupae" class=mrg>
[Tua mai (Thai); Beondegi (Korea); <i>Bombyx mori</i>]
<p>
In production of silk, the moth pupa is killed about 2 days before it 
would emerge, ruining the cocoon. the raw silk is then produced by 
unwinding the cocoon, leaving the pupa exposed. It can be used in 
numerous ways, and one of these ways is human food.<p>
<p>This is the one insect that's easy to find in Los Angeles. All the big 
Asian markets have foam trays of them in the frozen food cases. They 
are also available in cans, but the canned ones need to be soaked in 
multiple changes of water to eliminate the off flavor. They are marinated, 
then roasted or fried, and sold by street vendors in Korea, China, Japan, 
Thailand and India. They are said to taste like raw chestnuts, cooked 
soybeans and mushrooms.  I will be trying them soon and will report.

<h2>Stink Bug</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_stinkg01h.jpg" alt="Live Green Stink Bug" class=mrg>
[Green Stink Bug; <i>Chinavia hilaris</i> and other species of family 
<i>Pentatomidae</i>]
<p>
The stink bugs are distributed worldwide, and many species are 
considered crop pests. This is one bug with which I have personal 
experience, as I didn't see that one had plopped into my wine glass. 
The flavor was interesting and not unpleasant, but I spit it out because 
I didn't know they were edible at the time. He was undamaged, though 
perhaps a little inebriated, so I tossed him back out the window.</p>
<p>This insect is so important in the state of Guerrero, just south of 
Mexico City, the town of Taxco has a temple dedicated to it, and on the 
first Monday following the Day of the Dead there is a festival in its 
honor, presided over by the <i>Se&ntilde;orita dia del Jumil</i>, or 
Miss Stink Bug as she would be called here. A green sauce and a chili 
sauce are made including roasted stink bugs.	Sauces are also made from 
them in Southeast Asia, and they are eaten in Africa as well.

<p>
These large grubs were one of the most important protein sources for the 
aboriginal people of Australia. They feed on roots of 
several trees, and can grow to 2-3/4 inches long. Raw, they are said to 
taste similar to almonds. Cooked they are crispy on the outside and the 
inside becomes a light yellow, similar to scrambled eggs.

<h2>Scorpion</h2>
<br><img src="img/ai_scorpa01k.jpg" alt="Live Black Scorpion" class=mrg>
[order <i>Scorpiones</i>]
<p>
Scorpions are native to every continent except Antarctica, usually in 
the warmer regions. Of 1752 species only 25 have venom that can kill 
humans. Deep fried scorpions are common in the night markets of northern 
China and are eaten in other parts of East and Southeast Asia. They are 
usually impaled on a bamboo skewer and dipped into hot frying oil. Fried 
scorpion is said to taste much like a crunchy potato chip, with a tasty 
liquidy bit in the middle. In Chinese markets vendors usually sell two 
sizes, big black ones and smaller dark beige ones.</p> 
<p>The photo is of an Asian Forest Scorpion (<i>Heterometrus 
laoticus</i>). These live in Vietnam and Laos where they grow to 4.7 
inches long. Their venom is painful but not life threatening. The South 
Asian Forest Scorpion (<i>Heterometrus swammerdami titanicus</i>) of Sri 
Lanka and Southern India is one of the largest in the world, growing to 
nearly 8 inches long and up to 2 ounces in weight. Its venom is not 
powerful because it uses its strong claws to crush its prey rather than 
stinging it to death. I don't know if people eat them in that region. 
Scorpion venom is very complex and is being extensively studied for 
possible pharmaceutical uses. &nbsp;

<p>
Fried tarantulas are a specialty of the Cambodian town of Sukon, but are 
also sold in Phnom Penh and other locations in that country. Though 
tarantulas have been eaten for more than 100 years we know of, they were 
not very popular. How they became popular in Cambodia is a matter of 
conjecture, but it may be from severe food shortages during the Khmer 
Rouge years. Now they are presented in baskets as a tourist attraction, 
selling for about 2002 US $0.08 each. They are very high in protein, and 
said to taste like a combination of chicken and cod. They are deep fried 
until the contents of the abdomen has congealed to a brown paste, 
consisting of internal organs, eggs (females only) and spider poop.

Native to East Asia and parts of Australia, these centipedes live in 
damp environments and grow to about 8 inches long. They have been much 
in the news lately, because the venom they produce is being researched 
as superior to morphine for pain control. They have been used in Chinese 
medicine for centuries.</p>
<p>In Chinese night markets they are threaded onto sticks and deep 
fried. They are reported to be slightly bitter and crunchy, without much 
substance. Best sprinkled with salt. It is also reported that the legs get 
stuck between your teeth.
