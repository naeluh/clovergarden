<p>In some regions of Southern Africa, these large moth caterpillars are a 
popular delicacy, but in other regions, millions of indigenous peoples depend 
on them for protein in their diets. They are picked by hand, mainly by women 
and children, and processed at home to preserve for future use, as their 
season is quite short.</p>
<p>Mopane worms are very nutritious, with an outstandingly high protein 
content and good mineral suite, but they are now threatened by overharvest, 
loss of habitat, and global warming. There is significant effort being put 
into farming them because the demand remains high.

<h3>Preparing Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; When a Caterpillar is captured the tail end 
is pinched off and the caterpillar is wrung out from front to back to clear 
the gut of icky green stuff. At home, the caterpillars are washed well, then 
simmered without additional water, but plenty of salt. Finally, they are set 
out to dry in the sun, or may be smoked over a fire. Commercially they are 
canned in brine, or with tomato and chili sauce. <p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Mopane are available from multiple on-line 
sources in North America when in season, but are sold out most of the year. 
They are very expensive here, even compared to other edible insects, at 
about 2021 US $18 for 50 grams (1-3/4 ounce).<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Dried caterpillars can be eaten as a crunchy snack, 
but they are often re-hydrated and stewed with onions, tomatoes and spices. 
For an example, see our recipe <a href="../recipes/qaa_mopane1.html">
