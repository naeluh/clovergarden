<p>This seaweed is found along rocky coasts of China, Korea and Japan, and is 
now cultivated along the coast of China and the Korean coast facing China. 
Used as a sea vegetable in Japan, it was brought to North America by the Michio 
Kushi Macrobiotic movement, and is now fairly common in Japanese restaurants 
here. It is imported from Japan, China and Korea in dried form, and that is 
how it is generally used in Japan.

<p>Hijiki is available in two forms, Leaf Form (M&eacute; Hijiki) as shown in 
the photo, and Wire Form (Naga Hijiki), which looks like a tangle of thin 
black wires. Either will work fine, but some prefer the Bud Form. Rehydrated 
and cooked it is said to have a slight anise flavor, but that resemblance is 
rather faint. It is used in a number of recipes in Japan, and also is ground 
to impart color and a speckled appearance to <a href="am_konjaz.html">

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; I have not found this seaweed in the Korean 
markets or the Chinese / Southeast Asian markets here in Los Angeles. 
Japanese markets are pretty much extinct here due to assimilation. It 
may be found in markets serving the Michio Kushi Macrobiotic folks, a 
subcult of the Yuppies. It is, however, available from a few vendors on 
the Internet, priced from high to absurd. The photo example was 
Well-Pac brand from Korea, 2022 US $17.72 for 1 pound, by far the best 
deal I found.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep the package tightly sealed and in 
a cool, dry place, protected from direct sunlight, and it should be quite 
usable for about a year.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; As shipped, Hijiki is black and very tough, so needs 
long soaking (30 minutes in warm water) and cooking to be edible . It has a 
nutty flavor which is enjoyed in soups, vegetable dishes, and salads. <p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition</h3> &nbsp; Hijiki is high in dietary fiber and 
a number of important minerals, particularly iodine, calcium, magnesium, and 
iron. It is also higher than most seaweeds in inorganic arsenic, which has 
resulted in cautionary pronouncements by a number of governments, including 
the US Department of Agriculture.
<p>The arsenic content is not likely to be 
dangerous in the quantities consumed in normal culinary usage, even in Japan, 
and no adverse effects have been reported. The warnings apply mainly to 
"health nuts" who tend to overdo "healthy" things until they aren't healthy, 
and also may apply to the Macrobiotic movement, as members eat unusually high 
amounts of seaweed, including Hijiki. On the plus side, many studies have 
brought up significant health benefits from Hijiki extracts, including 
anti-tumor factors and activity against HIV-1. Research is ongoing.<p></p>
