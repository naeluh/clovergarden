[Konbu, Kombu (Japan); Miyeok, Dashima (Korea); Haidai (China): 
  <i>Laminaria japonica</i> (and several other <i>Laminaria</i> species)]
<p>
This is edible kelp grown along the coasts of Japan, Korea  and China 
- quite different from the giant kelp of California which is processed 
rather than eaten directly. The long wide fronds are dried and packaged 
for use, particularly to make soup stock, but also for use as wrappers 
for various prepared foods. Almost all this kelp used for food is 
cultivated rather than gathered wild which explains why there are so 
few crunchy critters growing on it.</p>

<p>This kelp is normally sold as flat dried sheets cut from the fronds but 
is also sold as narrow cut strips, salted and bagged in the refrigerated 
section. In Japan it is also pickled and served as a snack to 
accompany green tea. The photo shows a piece of a frond as dried, and a 
shorter piece cut from the end after soaking.</p>

<p>Kelp is very important to the cuisine of Japan, particularly for making 
soup stock, generally in combination with shaved bonito flakes or, for 
vegetarians, dried shiitake mushrooms. It is also very popular in Korea 
and to a much lesser extent in China. In Japan, many varieties are sold by 
name, each with very specific uses. Here in North America, we use the Kelp 
we can get, and have no hint what variety it is. </p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This seaweed is 
easily found in large flat packages in any market serving a Japanese or 
Korean community, and to a lesser extent in other Asian markets. It is 
imported from both Japan and Korea and price varies greatly depending 
on the company's quality image.<p></p>
<p>Keep the package sealed as much as possible and in a cool, dry place 
away from light and it will last a year or so.</p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Do not wash - the slight amount of whitish 
powder on the outside is part of the product. When making soup, konbu 
is put in a pot with cold water which is then heated. The konbu is 
removed from the water just as it comes to a boil, as boiling will make 
for an overly strong taste. The soaked kelp can then be discarded or 
used for some other purpose.<p></p>
<p>Some more substantial recipes do call for strips of konbu to be cooked 
for a much longer time and eaten as part of the recipe. To prepare for 
cutting into strips, soak in cool water for about 1/2 hour.</p>
