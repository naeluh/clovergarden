<p>This coastal seaweed is a siphonous alga, meaning its round branches 
are composed of a tangle of near microscopic filaments, each filament 
being a single multinucleate cell. This accounts for its spongy texture. 
Its branching fronds grow up to about 12 inches long.</p>
<p>Sponge seaweed is very common as a temperate Pacific species from 
around Japan, but is also found along the Pacific coasts of Canada, 
California and northern Mexico. Two subspecies were thought to be 
invasives around Ireland and Britain, but genetics have shown them to 
be a separate population. It is possibly an invasive in other parts of 
the North Atlantic, especially along the Atlantic coast of North America 
and is a serious problem in Massachusetts. One subspecies grows around 
Australia, New Zealand, South America, the Falkland Islands, the southern 
tip of Africa and possibly as far south as Antarctica. Subspecies also 
exist in small regions of the Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>This seaweed can be a problem in shellfish beds, because it can grow 
profusely on the shells, hindering movement and feeding, and sometimes 
breaks them lose and floats them away, thus the name "Oyster Thief".

<p>Sponge Seaweed is used in various skin rejuvenation products, but 
in Asia, particularly Korea, it is used for food, particularly as 
a flavor and aroma modifying ingredient. It has a distinctive aroma 
compared to other seaweeds.</p>

This seaweed is valued in Korea mainly for inclusion in a number 
of kimchees, especially watery kimchees or those with a fish component. 
It is reputed to eliminate fishy smells, the smell of garlic, and 
aftertastes. The strands are typically 0.040 inch diameter dried and 
0.120 after soaking.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This seaweed is 
not easy to find, even in Korean markets here in Los Angeles. You have 
to take great care, because other seaweeds are often very thinly sliced 
into threads that look a lot like this one, and the package for all of 
them will probably just say "Dried Seaweed". The strands of this seaweed 
are round, not square, and it tends to be very tangled.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This seaweed is always soaked before cooking. 
It can be simmered a bit and served with a dash of rice vinegar to 
enliven it, but it's main use as an ingredient in kimchees.
