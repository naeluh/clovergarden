<p>
Wakame is a popular seaweed for soups and salads,particularly in 
Japan and Korea. its native region. It has become a troublesome 
invasive in New Zealand and some other places. It has also invaded 
California, but can't compete with native kelps. It is found here 
only in estuaries and disturbed places the native kelps haven't yet 
returned to.<p>
<p>It has a softly crunchy texture and a pleasant slightly spinachy 
flavor. While most familiar in North America as dry, brittle black 
tangles in plastic bags, it is also commonly available salted in 
bags in the refrigerated section of Korean markets.</p>
<p>The photo specimens are dried tangle (center), salted tangle 
briefly soaked (lower right) and a single piece from the salted tangle 
spread out (upper left). This is a short length cut from one side of 
the central stem.</p>
<p>Wakame has recently been found to contain a substance that 
stimulates production of a fat burning protein, so expect it to become 
better known in the West. It has become a troublesome invasive weed 
along the coasts of non-Asian countries, so eat up!</p>

<p>In Korea and Japan, fresh Wakame is often available, and there is 
the salted, which has better color and texture than the dried, but 
most people use the dried most of the time, for economy and ease of 
storage. This is so prevalent, most recipes don't mention any form 
except dried.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This seaweed is easily found in large plastic 
packages, filled with tangled looking seaweed, in any market serving a 
Japanese or Korean community, and to a lesser extent in other Asian 
markets. It is imported from both Japan and Korea, and price varies 
greatly depending on the company's quality image. Frozen may be 
available, but is usually a wholesale item for food processors.

<p>Dried Wakame should be very dark greenish black. Any light spots or 
brownish black instead of greenish black means it is old and/or has 
been stored improperly. When soaked, it should be very dark green and 
of uniform color, but green, not black or brown or unevenly colored.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; For dried, keep the package sealed as much as 
possible and in a cool, dry place away from light. Properly stored it 
will last a year or so. Salted is best kept refrigerated.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Wakame should be soaked in cool water for 
20 to 30 minutes, then drain and wring out excess water. Salted Wakame 
should be soaked for about 15 minutes to reduce salt.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; 1 ounce of dried wakame, soaked about 20 minutes 
and wrung out, will yield 8 ounces (8 times). Salted Wakame, after 
soaking to reduce salt, will be little changed in weight.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Wakame is generally used raw in salads, but 
is also used in soups, where it will be cooked briefly.<p></p>
