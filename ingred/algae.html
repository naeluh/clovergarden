<h1>Algae</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>"Algae" is a term of convenience for all the "seaweeds", but many 
microscopic entities are also lumped in - and 3 billion years of confused 
history. It used to be simple to say "Algae are not plants", but that is 
now highly controversial, and the relationships are still being worked 
out. Green and Red algae are now included in clade <i>Archaeplastida</i>, 
sort of <i>Plantae sensu lato</i> (plants viewed broadly), with red 
needing a bit more "lato" than green.  Brown algae are still safely not 
plants, but even that could change. Fortunately we can go ahead and eat 
them without waiting for all the confusion to be resolved.</p>
<p>I include Cyanobacteria on this page. They are no longer classed as 
algae, though still called "blue-green algae" by the health food industry 
(a more marketable designation than "pond scum"). Cyanobacteria are the 
sole generators of atmospheric oxygen, on their own or symbiotically 
inhabiting (in simplified form) the chloroplasts of both plants and 
algae.

<p>Seaweeds were gathered from the shore by our pre-human ancestors 
for use as food, and we continue to eat them today. They provide important 
minerals, particularly iodine, which can be in short supply from other 
sources. Besides being eaten as vegetables, algae and cyanobacteria are 
major feedstocks for the food processing, dietary supplement and medicinal 
industries.</p>

<p>Very few sea vegetables are toxic, but some are. Cyanobacteria and 
single celled algae can be highly toxic, and increasingly infest our 
oceans due to climate change and human pollution.</p>

</span> &nbsp; The brown algae are quite different from other seaweeds, 
more closely related to diatoms, downy mildew and other single cell life 
forms (See <a href="algae.html#a02">Note-A2</a>). They are multicellular, and do

   <h2>Laminariaceae Family</h2>
   
   <p>This large family of Kelps includes our most familiar seaweeds, 
   particularly the giant kelp that litters our West Coast beaches after 
   a storm. Kelps are of great economic, culinary and environmental 
   importance. They provide shelter and breeding grounds for many 
   animal species. They also have many uses in food processing, 
   including manufacturing vegan "caviar" - and many are eaten fresh 
   or dried.</p>

      (China): <i>Sacharina japonica</i> (formerly <i>Laminaria japonica</i>) 
      and several other <i>L.</i> species)]
      <p>
      This is edible kelp grown along the coasts of Japan, Korea  and 
      China - quite different from the giant kelp of California which 
      is processed rather than eaten directly. The long wide fronds are 
      dried and packaged for use particularly to make soup stock, but also for 
      to use as wrappers for various prepared foods. Almost all this kelp used 
      for food is cultivated rather than gathered wild which explains why there 
      are so few crunchy critters growing on it.</p>
      <p>This kelp is normally sold as flat dried sheets cut from the fronds but 
      is also sold as narrow cut strips, salted and bagged in the refrigerated 
      section. In Japan it is also pickled and and served as a snack to 
      accompany green tea. The photo shows a piece of a frond as dried, and a 
      shorter piece cut from the end after soaking.

      <p>
      This kelp is found from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska to Southern 
      California, and is an important member of the kelp forests. The 
      tubular stype can be up to 105 feet long, topped by a float bulb 
      and ribbon-like fronds up to 13 feet long by nearly 6 inches wide. 
      The stypes and bulbs need to be soaked in changes of water for a 
      few days, and then can be pickled or candied. The fronds need to be 
      dried before they have much flavor. Fronds covered with herring 
      eggs were very popular with northern Indian tribes.

      I'm making a presumption that the contents of the can was 
      <i>L. hyperborea</i>, because that's the kind of <i>Laminaria</i> 
      most common up there around Russia - but it could be <i>Laminaria 
      digitata</i>, a nearly identical kelp also found in the 
      region. The paper compliance label stuck to the bottom just said 
      "Laminaria" - everything else on the can was in Russian.</p>
      <p>The kelp strips were mild with a pleasant flavor, probably it's 
      used on the zakuska table. Clearly the Russians didn't quite 
      understand American labeling law, because the compliance sticker 
      listed Laminaria last. Ingred: Laminaria, vegetable oil, onions, 
      vinegar, salt, sugar, garlic, coriander, pepper. &nbsp;

      [Atlantic Kombu, Oarweed; <i>Laminaria digitata</i> (Atlantic) 
      &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Laminaria setchellii</i> (Northeast Pacific)]
      <p>
      The name "Sea Tangle" properly belongs to the Atlantic kelp 
      <i>L. digitata</i>, but many packages of kelp found in Asian 
      markets here in Los Angeles are labeled "Sea Tangle". Actually, this 
      commercially harvested kelp is closely related to the kombu kelps of 
      East Asia and can be used similarly, but is not found in the Pacific 
      at all.</p>
      <p>The photo, clearly labeled <i>Laminaria digitata</i>, was taken 
      in the eastern North Pacific (Washington State), so is probably the 
      very closely related <i>Laminaria setchellii</i>, which is a little 
      smaller. Both share the common name "oarweed". <i>L. setchellii</i> 
      is harvested from Alaska to California, and some could be sold as 
      Kombu in Asia, but the name "sea tangle" doesn't apply to it.

      <p>
      This seaweed grows in high surf environments from Vancouver Island, 
      Canada, to the central coast of California. It is illegal to 
      harvest it in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. In 
      California, where it is most consumed by Japanese communities in 
      the San Francisco region, recreational harvesting is forbidden, 
      and commercial harvesting is tightly regulated, with licensing, 
      fees and quotas. Both the fronds and the stypes are consumed, but 
      mostly the fronds. Dried fronds sell for about 2018 US $45 per 
      pound. Studies are underway to assure sustainable 
      harvests. This is one of a very few seaweeds that spend most of 
      their time out of the water.  The Sea Palm is not to be confused 
      with the Southern Sea Palm (<i>Eisenia arborea</i>), which is an 
      underwater species with much longer fronds.

      This seaweed is found on the northeast coasts of the Pacific, 
      and the northeast coasts of the Atlantic in cool temperate to 
      arctic waters. It grows to 16 feet long and nearly 8 inches wide, 
      living for two to four years. It is generally sold dried, and has 
      a sweeter taste than other kelps due to sugar alcohols (mannitol) 
      and monosodium glutamate/ There is interest in establishing it as 
      an aquaculture crop, especially due to extreme decline in some 
      areas, possibly an effect of global warming.

      <p>
      Along the temperate western coasts of North and South America, forests of 
      Giant Kelp provide food and shelter for fish, crustaceans and other sea 
      life. The greatest kelp forests in the world are off the coast of California 
      where fronds can grow to 200 feet (60 meters), and in the warm sunlit 
      waters of Southern California can grow more than 10 inches (25 cm) a day.</p>
      <p>California kelp is both an important resource and important to the health 
      of the marine environment so harvesting kelp is highly regulated here. The 
      main threat to kelp forests is not harvesting but sea urchins. Order more

      beer to ice cream, and also to feed farmed abalone.

      <p>
      Wakame is a popular seaweed for soups and salads,particularly in 
      Japan and Korea. its native region. It has become a troublesome 
      invasive in New Zealand and some other places. It has also invaded 
      California, but can't compete with native kelps. It is found here 
      only in estuaries and disturbed places the native kelps haven't yet 
      returned to.<p>
      <p>It has a softly crunchy texture and a pleasant slightly spinachy 
      flavor. While most familiar in North America as dry, brittle black 
      tangles in plastic bags, it is also commonly available salted in 
      bags in the refrigerated section of Korean markets.</p>
      <p>The photo specimens are dried tangle (center), salted tangle 
      briefly soaked (lower right) and a single piece from the salted 
      tangle spread out (upper left). This is a short length cut from 
      one side of the central stem.</p>
      <p>Wakame has recently been found to contain a substance that 
      stimulates production of a fat burning protein, so expect it to become 
      better known in the West. It has become a troublesome invasive weed 
      along the coasts of non-Asian countries, so eat up!

      can grow to a maximum length of about 7 feet.</p>
      <p>The midribs of this seaweed are sweet and crunchy, often eaten 
      raw or chopped and included in salads. The leafy part of the 
      frond is a bit acrid raw, so is dried and rehydrated before 
      use. The reproductive fronds at the base of the main frond (bottom 
      left in photo) are peanutty in flavor.

      can grow to 13 feet, but is usually quite a bit shorter in 
      Alaska. When harvesting, only the top half of the frond should 
      be cut off for use. This allows the plant to continue to live 
      and produce spores to keep the population stable.</p>
      <p>Usage is much the same as <i>A. esculenta</i> (see above), 
      except the leafy parts of the frond are often used fresh, though 
      more often dried and rehydrated so they can be stored for future

   [<i>Himanthalia elongata</i> of family <i>Himanthaliaceae</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and East Atlantic from Scandinavia 
   down to Portugal, this seaweed grows to about 7 feet. The stringy 
   fronds spawn, then decay in the late summer. New ones will sprout 
   in the second and third years. Sea Spaghetti has been used for food 
   for many years, in various dishes where its beefy or nutty flavors 
   are appreciated.

&nbsp; Red Algae (see <a href="algae.html#a03">Note-A3</a>) is adapted to living at 
greater depth than green and brown algae, but not all do so. Its pigment 
reflects red light and absorbs blue, the color that penetrates deepest. 
Red algae are now widely accepted as plants - but only by the broadest 
definition of "plants", so acceptance isn't universal and is subject to 
change without notice.<p></p>

   Nori is shredded and made up into paper-like sheets very much the way 
   handmade paper is made. These sheets are lightly toasted which turns 
   them green. They are used as a wrapping for sushi, as a garnish, as a

&nbsp; Green Algae (see <a href="algae.html#a01">Note-A1</a>) is now widely

   and <i>Ulva clathrata</i> (next paragraph)]
   <p>
   Sea lettuce is found in tidal and near tidal seawater worldwide, 
   generally anchored to rocks or other algae. It is eaten raw in salads 
   and cooked in soups, particularly in Scandinavia, Great Britain, 
   Ireland, China, and Japan. It is also eaten dried (see next paragraph)
   </p>
   <p>Sea lettuce is small, generally around 6 inches long but can grow 
   to nearly 40 inches. It is almost transparently thin and consists of a 
   single wide frond anchored at one point. It may be ruffled or somewhat 
   divided, generally resembling the lettuce leaves after which it is 
   named. <i>U. lactuca</i> is common worldwide in tropical and temperate 
   regions, but is less common in arctic regions.</p>
   <p>Most sea lettuce is gathered wild as it grows prolifically wherever 
   there are sufficient nutrients, in both highly and moderately saline 
   waters, but some is farmed.

   see also <i>U. lactuca</i> (above)]
   <p>
   Stone Hair is often used dried in China, either rehydrated or 
   ground to powder as a flavoring ingredient (Tai tyau feen). The 
   photo specimen is <i>U. intestinalis</i>, but <i>U. clathrata</i> 
   goes under the same Chinese name. These are long stringy species 
   consisting of very thin walled tubes, but <i>U. lactuca</i> (see 
   above) is also used dried. Conversely, these two species are also 
   used fresh. All these species of Sea Lettuce are important to the 
   Buddhist diet in China, both dried and fresh.</p>
   <p><i>U. intestinalis</i> can grow to about 8 inches long, while 
   <i>U. clathrata</i> can grow to nearly 16 inches long. Both are 
   found worldwide, but <i>U. intestinalis</i> is much more common 
   in temperate regions than tropical, and ventures into the arctic.  
   <i>U. clathrata</i> is common in tropical and subtropical regions, 
   but is very scarce in subarctic regions.

   <p>
   This Indo-Pacific seaweed is common in tropical regions but less 
   common in the subtropics and barely ventures into temperate regions 
   at all. It is totally absent from the Atlantic. Sea Grape is now 
   successfully farmed in the Philippines, where it is liked raw with 
   vinegar as a snack, or in a salad with chopped onions, tomato and a 
   dressing of fish sauce and vinegar. It is eaten similarly in Okinawa, 
   Japan. Known to be high in iodine, it has a light pleasant seaweed 
   flavor and a satisfying crunchiness when bitten. The stems are tough 
   and stringy, but small and entirely tolerable (swallow them, you need 
   more fiber anyway).</p>
   <p>The photo specimens were packed in salt, 
   sold at a local Philippine market for 2015 US $4.99 for a package 
   weighing about 4 ounces. About half the weight was in salt, but when 
   the seaweed is rinsed and re-hydrated it'll probably weigh about the 
   same. We have included our ubiquitous red kidney bean for scale.

   <p>This coastal seaweed is a siphonous alga, meaning its round branches 
   are composed of a tangle of near microscopic filaments, each filament 
   being a single multinucleate cell. This accounts for its spongy texture. 
   Its branching fronds grow up to about 12 inches long.</p>
   <p>Sponge seaweed is very common as a temperate Pacific species from 
   around Japan, but is also found along the Pacific coasts of Canada, 
   California and northern Mexico. Subspecies are found in the eastern 
   North Atlantic, but especially along the Atlantic coast of North 
   America, where it is a serious invasive. One subspecies grows around 
   Australia, New Zealand, South America, the southern tip of Africa, 
   and possibly as far south as Antarctica. Subspecies also exist in 
   small regions of the Mediterranean.

   <p>
   This single celled algae was, in the 1940s and 1950s expected to, by 
   now, be one of the most important food crops in the world. This did not 
   happen for a number of reasons. Production proved far more expensive than 
   expected, it proved entirely indigestible unless its cell walls were 
   broken down by processing, it proved difficult to make anything from it 
   that you'd actually want to eat, and methods were found to greatly improve 
   output of conventional agricultural products.</p>
   <p>Today chlorella is sold mainly as a health food supplement. It has 
   been found effective at removing toxic heavy metals and dioxins from the 
   body. It is also thought effective for treating radiation poisoning, 
   reducing blood pressure and cholesterol, and improving immune function, 
   though these claims are not without contention,  &nbsp; <small>Drawing

Lichens are symbiotic composite organisms consisting of a fungus body 
within which live either single cell algae or cyanobacteria. This 
relationship, playing on the strengths of each, allows the  organism to 
live in extremely harsh environments, from arctic tundra to dry deserts 
and on bare rock, though they are also abundant in temperate and 
rainforest environments. Lichens are used as food by many cultures 
around the world sometimes as a survival essential and sometimes as 
a delicacy. Licnes now have their own

Cyanobacteria (see <a href="algae.html#a04">Note-A4</a>) is an often blue-green 
bacteria, some varieties of which adhere to each other in long strands 
that mat together into a mass resembling algae. While some formerly 
dormant varieties are now causing problems with toxic blooms (due mainly 
to human pollution), we cannot be too resentful of them. Cyanobacteria 
are solely responsible for the oxygen in the atmosphere (Click on drawing 
for larger and more detailed illustration).</p>
<p>Originally they made oxygen all by themselves but now many live in the 
chloroplasts of plants and algae where they are the engine that actually 
generates the oxygen. Apparently some eukaryotes ingested cyanobacteria 
but found them indigestible. The cyanobacteria found the insides of the 
eukaryotes cozy and settled in. The several types of chloroplasts show 
this happened more than once.</p>

   <p>
   Spirulina is the commercial name for <i>Arthrospira</i>, a 
   Cyanobacteria that forms into spiral threads that can be harvested as 
   pond scum. Spirulina proper is a different bacteria and is not used for 
   food.</p>

   <p>This algae was a significant nutrient for the Aztecs and still 
   is for some African tribes, but its commercial potential has been 
   overblown. Wild, unsupportable claims by health food purveyors 
   have brought heavy fines in California, but the claims continue. 
   This is not to say it is not nutritious, it is, containing a fairly 
   balanced protein, many vitamins, minerals and nutritional pigments, 
   as well as fatty acids</p>   
 
   <p>The problem here is that all these nutrients can by obtained at 
   much lower cost from other sources. Promoters haven't been able to 
   get spirulina accepted as a general food either, because it looks bad, 
   tastes bad and can be heavily contaminated with insects, copepods 
   (tiny crustaceans) and worse - It's grown in open ponds.</p>

   <p>Spirulina has been promoted to ethical vegetarians as a source of 
   Vitamin B12, which they desire to get from non-animal sources (of 
   which there aren't any of useful concentration in nature). It does 
   contain a significant amount of a form of B12 not usable by the human 
   body, but any usable B12 in Spirulina appears to come from insect 
   and copepod contamination (animals, in other words). The more 
   contamination the more B12.

   Not actually a moss, this land dwelling cyanobacteria forms long 
   strands that look like hair. It is harvested in the Gobi Desert and 
   the Qinghai Plateau, but harvesting has been restricted due to 
   resulting erosion. Due to increasing cost, sellers have responded in 
   the time honored Chinese way - by adulterating the product. Real Fat 
   Choy is dark green - the adulterant strands, made from starch, are 
   usually black. Real Fat Choy will stand up to over 30 minutes of 
   simmering, but adulterant strands will disintegrate.
