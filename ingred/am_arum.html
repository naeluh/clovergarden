<h1>Arums</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>The Arum Family (<i>Araceae</i>) are bog plants well 
known in North America for decorative varieties</span> like Calla Lilies, 
Philodendrons, and the Titan Arum (<i>Amorphophallus titanum</i>) from 
Sumatra, which makes the newspapers whenever one blooms. It's the worlds 
largest flower (to 15 feet tall) and smells like a rotting corpse to 
attract pollinating insects. In contrast, <i>Wolfia</i> duckweeds, also 
Arums, have the smallest known flowers, one hundredth of an inch (0.3 mm) 
long.</p>
<p>While the Titan Arum isn't much eaten, corms (swollen underground 
stems) of some far less spectacular arums are important in the diet of 
many tropical peoples. &nbsp;

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The Arums are a fairly large family and common as ornamentals, but 
only a few members are significant as food. Taro has been spread by 
Polynesian settlers throughout the Pacific Islands and as far as Hawaii. 
It has long been an important food for these peoples because it is one 
of the few starchy vegetables that thrive in a hot and very wet 
environment.</p>

<p><u>Caution:</u> Arums foliage and some roots typically contain large 
amounts of sharp pointed Calcium Oxalate crystals that cause severe 
irritation and swelling of the mouth and throat which can be fatal 
through strangulation. Should you manage to swallow them, they break 
down into Calcium and corrosive Oxalic Acid in the digestive tract 
causing severe gastric distress. It is important that all Arums be 
properly prepared and cooked before ingestion.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="duck">Duckweed</h2>
<br><a href="am_duckz.html">
<img src="img/am_duck01e.jpg" alt="Blanket of Duckweeds" class=mrg></a>
[Water Lentil; Family <i>Araceae</i>, Subfamily <i>Lemnoideae</i>, four 
Genera]
<p>
These tiny, free floating, aquatic weeds are native to temperate, subtropical, 
and tropical regions worldwide. They have evolved into very simple plants, 
discarding many features of the larger arums. They consists of a single oval 
green thallus (not a true leaf), that reproduces both by budding and sexually 
by flowers.</p>

<p>While the Titan Arum has the largest bloom in the plant world, Duckweeds 
have the smallest, only three to four hundredths of an inch (0.76 to 1.0 mm) 
long. Duckweeds are important for research, pharmaceutical production, 
animal food, and in some regions human food. This group of plants now has 
it's own <a href="am_duckz.html"><b>Duckweeds</b></a> page.

<h2>Elephant Foot Yam</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_eleph05k.jpg" alt="Whole Elephant Foot Corm" class=mrg>
[Suran (India); <i>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius</i>]
<p>
Native to Southeast Asia, this arum produces another warm, super-stinky 
flower pretending to be a rotting dead animal. Mercifully the flower is 
much smaller than that of the Titan Arum. The corms of this plant, which 
look remarkably like old anti-tank mines, are cooked and eaten in 
Southeast Asia and in India, where efforts are being made to develop it 
into a major crop. Despite the name, it is not a yam. As canned "Suran" 
it is sometimes seen in Indian markets in North America.

<h2>Konjac</h2>

<img src="img/am_konjac02h.jpg" alt="Whole Konjac Corm" class=mrg></a>
[Devil's Tongue; Konnyaku (Japan); Gonyak (Korea); <i>Amorphophallus 
konjac</i>]
<p>
The Konjac plant is native to tropical and warm temperate zones of 
East Asia, as far north as Japan, and as far south as Indonesia. It has 
been planted in Hawaii. It is harvested for root corms that can be up 
to 10 inches in diameter. Corms are ground up and extracted to produce 
a flour that is almost entirely soluble fiber. This fiber has many food 
industry uses as a gelling agent, thickener, film former, emulsifier, 
and stabilizer.</p>
<p>The flour is also made into a clear jelly formed into blocks and 
noodles, much used in Japan and Korea. This jelly is often colored with 
powdered Hijiki seaweed. The flour is also used by vegans as a substitute 
for gelatin, and by diabetics as a thickener having almost no calories 
or carbs. It is being promoted as a weight loss item, but there are 
some dangers.

<p>
Rhizomes of this common wetland plant found in the northeast U.S. 
were eaten by Native Americans in times past but it is no longer a 
significant food plant.

<h2>Malanga</h2>

[Yautia (Puerto Rico), Malanga (Cuba), <a href="am_malangz.html"><b>Many 
More Names</b></a>; <i>xanthosoma sagittifolium</i> (malanga blanca)]
<p>
Native to northern South America, this arum is now also grown all through 
the Caribbean region and Central America, and is particularly popular in 
Cuba and Puerto Rico. The plant is also now grown in West Africa as an 
alternative to yams and taro (cocoyam) and in Hawaii as 'ape (say 
"Ah-pay").</p>
<p>The corm is somewhat mucilaginous and cooks to a smoother texture than 
potato, with chunks holding their shape well. The longer of the photo 
specimens, obtained from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles, was 8-1/2 
inches long, 2-5/8 inches in diameter at the thickest part, and weighed 
14 ounces.

<h2>Skunk Cabbage</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_skunk01k.jpg" alt="Live Skunk Cabbage" class=mrg>
[<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>]
<p>
Rhizomes of this common wetlands plant, found in North America from southern 
Canada to Georgia, were eaten by Native Americans in 
times past but it is no longer a significant food plant here. It 
inhabits damp stream beds and gets its name from the skunk-like 
odor the leaves exude when damaged. This plant was very common in the back 
woods of New Jersey where I lived for a while as a child.

(S.E. Asia); Dalo (Fiji); Cara (Brazil); Calaloo (Caribbean, leaves 
only);  Yautia (Puerto Rico); <i>Colocasia esculenta</i>]
<p>
Probably native to the wetlands of Malaysia, taro was carried through the 
Pacific region as far as Hawaii by seagoing canoe, and by traders as far 
as ancient Egypt and Rome. In more modern times it has been carried to all 
tropical and near tropical areas, including Africa, Central America and 
the Caribbean. Cold tolerant varieties are grown in China, Korea and 
Japan. The photo specimens run up to about 5 inches inch long, 2-1/2 inches 
diameter and about 5 ounces.

<p>
Taro leaves are, of course, grown wherever Taro Corms are grown 
(see our <a href="am_taroz.html"><b>Taro / Colocosia</b></a> page). 
They are edible, and are cooked and eaten in most of those regions. They 
do need much different treatment, because the Oxalic Acid and Calcium 
Oxalate content can't be simply peeled off as it can with the corms.</p>
<p>While these have been pretty much unavailable in North America, they 
are now showing up in Philippine markets here in Los Angeles, and are 
selling very well when they appear.

<h2>Giant Trunk Taro</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_tarog04h.jpg" alt="Giant Trunk Taro Plants" class=mrg>
[<i>Unidentified</i>]
<p>
Some searches for "Cooking Giant Taro" come up with videos featuring this 
Taro. In all these videos, everyone is dressed in Indian clothes, so I 
presume this is a Variety found in India. The photo here is from Wikimedia, 
and was labeled <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i>, but it certainly does not look 
anything at all like any other photos of that species. The stem is the part 
eaten, and may be up to about 5 inches diameter. First the brown bark is cut 
away, then the white core is sliced up into short, fairly thin pieces. It 
is cooked by boiling, and holds its shape well.

Simiden (Chuuk); Swam taro (Papua New Guinea), Navia (Vanuatu); Palawan 
(Philippines); Mane (Nepal); <i>Cyrtosperma merkusii</i>]
<p>
This Taro can grow even larger than the Giant Elephant Ear, with leaves that 
exceed 6 feet long and 4 feet wide, and corms that can weigh up to 220 pounds 
(100 kg). It is endemic to the islands of Oceania, particularly those in the 
mid Pacific where it is a critical contributor to nutrition for the people 
who live there. It is difficult to grow, and becoming more difficult as Global 
Warming is raising the sea level. Salt water increasingly is invading the 
growing ponds and reducing the fresh water lens these plants depend on. The 
corms need to be boiled for hours to detoxify them.</p>
<p>This Taro also grows along stream banks in the tropical parts of Nepal, 
where it is harvested in January and February. Leaves, Stems, and Corms 
are all eaten, and all need lengthy boiling and changes of the water to 
remove irritating and toxic elements.

[Indian Taro; Bac ha (Viet); <i>Colocasia gigantea</i>]
<p>
Often sold as "Taro Stems", this plant is native to Southeast Asia, and 
is thought to be a natural cross between <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i> 
and <i>Colocasia esculenta</i> (Taro). The stems are eaten as a vegetable 
in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and in Japan. The root corms 
of this species are fibrous and inedible, and the leaves are not 
particularly edible either.

<br><img src="img/am_aromac01h.jpg" alt="Alocasia Leaf and Flower" class=mrg>
[Baibing (Mizo); <i>Alocasia fornicata</i> - also - <i>Colocasia affinis</i>]
The Spadix (flower spike) of these plants are harvested in the wild as a 
seasonal vegetable in the far northwest corner of Burma and the adjacent 
states of far eastern India. The Spadix, like the rest of the plant, contains 
sharp calcium oxalate crystals, so must be sufficiently cooked to be edible. 
The Photo is <u>not</u> of <i>Alocasia fornicata</i> as no suitable image was 
available. It is of <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i>, but should look pretty 
similar.
