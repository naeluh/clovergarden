[Bac Ha (Viet - South and U.S.); Doc Mung, Roc Mung (Viet - North); 
Indian Taro; Hasu-imo, Ryukyu (Japan); Manto de Eva (Chile) 
<i>Colocasia gigantea</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to Southeast Asia, and is thought to be a natural 
cross between <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i> and <i>Colocasia esculenta</i> 
(Taro). The stems are eaten as a vegetable in Southeast Asia, 
particularly Vietnam, and in Japan. The root corms of this species are 
fibrous and inedible, and the leaves are not particularly edible either.

The photo to the left shows what the plant looks like. Some varieties 
can grow leaves up to 5 feet across. The stems are peeled and used as 
slices or short segments, mostly in soups. They have little flavor, but 
are valued for their foamy sponge-like texture and ability to hold a lot 
of the broth flavor.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Colocasia stems are available in Asian markets 
that serve a Southeast Asian community. The photo specimens was a stem 
cut into segments for easy handling. The largest segment was 2-1/8 inch 
across the big end. Purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2016 US $3.99 / pound. It is very light, so 11 segments 
averaging 7 inches long weighed only 1-1/8 pound.
