<h1>Duckweeds</h1>
<br><img src="img/am_duckvw01g.jpg" alt="Three kinds of Duckweed" class=mrg>

Duckweeds belong to Family <i>Araceae</i>, the Arum Family. They comprise 
Subfamily <i>Lemnoideae</i>, which contains four Genera: <i>Lemna</i>, 
<i>Spirodela</i>, <i>Wolffia</i>, and <i>Wolffiella</i>.

<p>These plants are all tiny free floating individuals that live in slow moving 
fresh water environments, in tropical to temperate regions. They have evolved 
into very simple plants, discarding or greatly reducing most features of the 
other Arums. They do still have functional flowers, but while the 
<a href="am_arum.html"><b>Titan Arum</b></a> has the largest bloom in the 
world, Duckweeds have the smallest flowers found in nature.</p>

<p>Duckweeds are of growing importance for human nutrition, botanical 
research, pharmaceutical production, animal feed, and waste water 
remediation - municipal, agricultural, and industrial.

<p>The photo to the left shows <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> (large fronds - 
1 cm / 0.39 inch), <i>Lemna minor</i> (medium fronds), and <i>Wolffia 
arrhiza</i> (very small fronds).

<h2 class=lrg id="wolf">Genus Wolfia</h2>

<p>This is the genus most of interest for human nutrition. While currently 
used as food mainly in Southeast Asia (Burma, Laos, Thailand), these plants 
are gaining a lot of attention in the West as a farmed product. They are 
very high in quality protein, higher than soybeans. They also yield fiber, 
and many other important nutrients. They grow so fast under ideal conditions 
that growing ponds must be harvested almost daily.</p>

<p>They are being processed as a food ingredient and supplement, and now 
(late 2019) have been found to be the first known significant plant source 
of bioavailable vitamin B12. While some other Duckweeds contain calcium 
oxalate, Wolfias do not. One grower in the US has self certified 
Duckweed as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), and has received a "no 
objection" letter from the FDA.</p>

<p>The various species of <i>Wolfia</i> are all very similar in properties 
and usefulness. Which one is actually the smallest vascular flowering plant 
in the world is up for debate, but they are all of about the same size.  We 
have given details of only two that are currently in cultivation in North 
America. Others of note are all very similar to these two. <i>Wolffia 
angusta</i>, <i>W. australiana</i>, <i>W. borealis</i>, <i>W. 
brasiliensis</i>, and <i>W. columbiana</i> are prominent examples.</p>

   <h2>Wolfia arrhiza</h2>
   <br><img src="img/am_duckwa01e.jpg" alt="Wolfia Arrhiza in Water" class=mrg>
   [Spotless Watermeal, Rootless Duckweed; Khai-nam (Thai (lit "eggs of the 
   water"); <i>Wolfia arrhiza</i>]
   <p>
   This is the smallest vascular flowering plant in the world. Each green 
   thallus in the photo is a whole mature independent plant, 1mm (0.039 inch) 
   or less long. It has no roots, stems, or leaves, It's main means of 
   reproduction is budding, but the minute flowers are functional and it can 
   reproduce sexually as well. It produces energy both by photosynthesis, and 
   by absorbing carbon from its environment.</p>

   <p><i>W. arrhiza</i> is so prolific, growing ponds can be harvested every 3 
   to 4 days. It is a warm water plant, and if the water gets too cold, it 
   sinks to the bottom of the pond and becomes a dormant starchy turion until 
   the water is warmer.</p>

   <p>This is a very nutritious plant, and is used for food in  Burma, Laos, 
   and Thailand. Dried, it is 40% protein. The plant also provides important 
   amino acids, as well as minerals, including calcium, magnesium, and zinc. 
   Most unusually, it is a vegetable source for Vitamin B12, long thought to 
   be mythical.</p>

   <p><i>W. arrhiza</i> is also used for treatment of agricultural and 
   municipal waste water. In recirculating inland shrimp farms, it is used to 
   treat the outflow from the ponds. The plant can then be harvested and used 
   as feed for Chickens, Tilapia, and Carp.

   <h2>Wolfia globosa</h2>

   [Asian watermeal; <i>Wolfia globosa</i>]
   <p>
   This Duckweed is very similar to <i>Wolfia arrhiza</i> in size and 
   characteristics. Each green spheroid in the photo is a whole mature 
   independent plant, most of which are now budding for reproduction. They 
   are less than 1mm (0.039 inch) long. they have no roots, stems, or leaves. 
   Their main means of reproduction is budding, but the minute flowers are 
   functional and they can reproduce sexually as well.</p>

   <p>Cultivation and usage of <i>W. globosa</i> is also about the same as 
   <i>W. arrhiza</i>, and it has also been found to be a vegetable source for 
   Vitamin B12.

<h2>Spirodela polyrhiza</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_ducksp01e.jpg" alt="Spirodela polyrhiza in Water" class=mrg>
[Common Duckmeat, Greater Duckweed, Great Duckmeat, Common Duckweed; 
<i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i>]
<p>
This Duckweed is found in temperate and tropical regions of North, Central, 
and South America, Asia, and Central Europe. It is rarely found in Australia 
and not found in New Zealand. It consists of a disk up to 1 cm (0.39 inch) 
diameter with several short roots. It is green or reddish on the top side 
and dark red on the bottom side. 

<p>This Duckweed is not used directly as human food, because it tends to 
absorb toxic heavy metals (lead, aresnic, mercury), and there is the possibility 
of bacterial infection. It is used for waste water remediation in agricultural 
and industrial environments. If used for agricultural waste water, it is then 
harvested and used as feed for Poultry (including Ducks), and for Fish. It 
proved to reduce growth of Rainbow Trout, but increase growth of Tilapia. 
That used to remove toxic heavy metals from industrial waste cannot be fed 
to animals or used as a soil amendment. This plant is also considered 
excellent for Biofuel applications.</p>

<p><p><i>S. polyrhiza</i> is a warm water plant, and if the water gets too 
cold (7&deg;C / 45&deg;F) it sinks to the bottom of the pond and becomes a 
dormant starchy turion until the water reaches 15&deg;C / 59&deg;F.

<h2>Lemna minor</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_ducklm01e.jpg" alt="Lemna minor in Water" class=mrg>
[Common Duckweed, Lesser Duckweed; <i>Lemna Minor</i>]
<p>
This duckweed is native to Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, and has 
been introduced to Australia and South America. It is usually in the form of 
1 to 3 leaves, each leaf having a root. The leaves may be up to 8 mm long and 
up to 5 mm wide (0.32 x 0.20 inch) and the roots up to 2 cm (0.79 inch) long. 
It mainly reproduces by the leaves separating and growing new attached leaves, 
but it also reproduces sexually by flowers and seeds. It's sticky roots cause 
birds to distribute it from pond to pond.</p>

<p>This Duckweed is not used directly as human food, because it tends to 
absorb toxic heavy metals. It is used for waste water remediation, 
particularly in agricultural environments. It is then harvested and used as 
feed for Poultry (including Ducks), and for Fish, or as soil amendment. That 
used to remove toxic heavy metals from industrial waste cannot be fed to 
animals or used in soil. This plant is also being seriously considered for 
Biofuel applications.</p>

<p><p><i>L. minor</i> is a warm water plant, and if the water gets too cold 
(7&deg;C / 45&deg;F) it sinks to the bottom of the pond and becomes a 
dormant starchy turion until the water is warmer.
