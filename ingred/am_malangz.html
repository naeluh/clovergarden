Native to northern South America, this arum is now also grown all through 
the Caribbean region and Central America, and is particularly popular in 
Cuba and Puerto Rico. As "New Cocoyam", Malanga is also now grown in West 
Africa as an alternative to yams and taro (Cocoyam). It is also grown in 
Hawaii as 'Ape (say "Ah-pay"), and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The corm is somewhat mucilaginous and cooks to a smoother texture than 
potato, with chunks holding their shape well. The flavor is closer to potato 
than other tropical root vegetables, but is a little more nutty than potatoes 
are. The longer of the photo specimens, obtained from a multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles, was 8-1/2 inches long, 2-5/8 inches in diameter at the thickest 
part, and weighed 14 ounces.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These Corms are now widely available in 
North America, from markets serving Hispanic, Southeast Asian, and 
Philippine communities. A recent purchase from a Philippine market was 
at 2017 US $2.49 / pound, but they are often at a lower price in 
markets serving a Hispanic community.

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Malanga should be stored at a cool 
room temperature, not below 45&deg;F/7&deg;C.

<h2 class=h1>Malanga Leaves</h2>
<br>

[Macabo, Taioba (Brazil); Tannia, Tannier (Caribbean); Nkontomire (Ghana); 
<i>Xanthosoma saggitifolium</i>]
<p>These leaves are now eaten in many tropical and sub-tropical regions 
around the world. They have a lower calcium oxalate level than 
<a href="am_tarolz.html"><b>Taro Leaves</b></a> so are easier to prepare. 
While the leaves look similar at first glance, Malanga Leaves have the stem 
attached at the point of the "V" notch, while Taro Leaves are attached several 
inches below the "V" notch. Malanga Leaves also grow very much larger.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Not easy in North America. There is a known 
experimental farm at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, which sells the  
leaves in local markets. It may also be available in Florida where Malanga 
is a commercial crop. It is also considered an invasive weed there. It is 
frost sensitive, but should be easy to grow in warmer regions. It is best 
grown in raised beds of well drained, just moist soil to prevent diseases.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Leaves and stems must be cooked because they contain 
calcium oxalate, though not as much as spinach. It is usually cooked much like 
Spinach. In Brazil, the leaf is stripped from the veins and stir fried in 
Olive Oil with Garlic, and a minimal amount of water if needed. The leaves 
take longer to cook than Spinach because they are quite a bit thicker. In 
Suriname the leaves are often baked with a Maggi&reg; cube and served as 
a side dish. Young and tender leaves are also used in stews and soups.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition</h3> &nbsp; Malanga Leaf and Stems contain 
calcium oxalate, but not as much as in Spinach. The leaf is 27% protein, high 
in Vitamin C, and rich in Calcium Iron, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Manganese.
