<h1>Giant Taro</h1>

[Giant Taro, Giant Alocasia (English); Badjang (Philippines); 'Ape (Hawaii 
(not unique)); Vi'a or Bi'a (Taiwan Austronesian); Biga, Bira (Philippines); 
Birah (Malay); Cunjevoi, Hakkin, Bargadga, Nargan, Bundal (Australia); 
<i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i>]
<p>
<p><i>A. macrorrhizos</i> is not actually a Taro, but closely related 
(<i>Alocasia</i> means "Like Taro). This plant is native to the rainforests 
of Island Southeast Asia, and as far south as Queensland, Australia. It was 
originally cultivated in the Philippines, and spread from there through the 
Pacific Islands. Some islanders considered it "famine food", and much 
preferred Taro. The leaves can get up to 6 feet long and over 3 feet wide.
</p>

<p>A video from the Philippines shows a man uprooting a wild plant and 
discarding the whole thing. The root was very short. He then started digging 
out small Cormels from around where the root had been to actually cook and 
eat. He did complain about them being so small (about 5 x 1-1/4 inches).</p>

<p>The leaf stems (petioles) of this plant are apparently used in some regions, 
just sliced up, boiled, and included in curries. Usability of leaf stems may 
depend on particular cultivars.</p>

<p> Nothing I have seen in photos, videos, or descriptions suggests the 
<a href="am_tarobgz.html"><b>"Big Taro"</b></a> corms common in the 
Philippine and Southeast Asian markets here in Los Angeles come from this 
plant.

In the Philippines, a sweet called Binagol is traditionally made from the 
Giant Taro, though most recipes I see for it call for regular Taro. This 
confection is made with condensed milk, sugar, coconut milk, and egg yolks.
It is placed in a half coconut shell, wrapped in banana leaves, and steamed 
for 30 minutes or more.
