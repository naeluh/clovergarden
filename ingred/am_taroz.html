Probably native to the wetlands of Malaysia, taro was carried throughout 
the Pacific as far as Hawaii by seagoing canoe, and by traders as far as 
ancient Egypt and Rome. In more modern times it has been carried to all 
tropical and near tropical regions, including Africa and Central America. 
Cold tolerant varieties are grown in China, Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>Taro Corms (called taro root) are short underground stems rich in 
starch. Unlike most starchy vegetables they are high in amylose, a starch 
soluble in hot water, and contain 3% sugar, which makes them somewhat 
sweet. Taro is indigestible raw and can cause severe gastrointestinal 
distress if not properly prepared and cooked. The photo specimens run 
up to about 5 inches long, 2-1/2 inches diameter and about 5 ounces</p>

A well known use of taro in the U.S. is for making the Hawaiian staple 
"poi". Taro corms are peeled, boiled, then mashed on a board with special 
masher tools, usually of stone, and usually by the men. The mash is then 
adjusted with water to make the desired thickness, "one finger", 
"two finger" and "three finger" (the thinnest). It may be eaten fresh or 
fermented for a few days when it will be a little sour and smell similar 
to yogurt. "Table Taro" is Taro steamed and served whole or as chunks like 
Potato, and Taro Chips are also made. Hawaii grows both wetland and 
dryland varieties of Taro.

<p>All across Oceania (the remote Pacific Islands) taro is used similarly 
to how it is used in Hawaii, boiled, baked, and roasted. This is part of 
Polynesian and Micronesian culture. Earliest evidence of use is from the 
Solomon Islands, predating 20,000 BP (Before Present).</p>

<p>In India, recipes call for taro corms as "colocasia root". They are 
used as chunks in Curries and Sambars in South India. Colocasia stems are 
also used, and in some areas the leaves also, but rarely the flowers.  We 
cover leaves and stems on a separate <a href="am_tarolz.html"><b>Taro 
Leaves &amp; Stems</b></a> page.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome, colocasia root was boiled and served with sauces or 
boiled along with meats, much as potatoes are today. Because it was 
imported from Egypt, colocasia disappeared from Europe upon the fall of 
the Roman Empire, except for Cyprus where it is still grown and cooked 
as kolokassi.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Taro corms are widely available in North 
America, due to their common use by Hispanic, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, 
Hawaiian, African and other communities of tropical and subtropical 
origin. They should be firm and unwrinkled, with no soft spots or mold.
Select the larger ones, as they will be easier to peel.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Store like potatoes, in a cool dry place with 
no direct sunlight. They will keep for a week or so.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Taro corms must be peeled to remove toxic Oxalic 
Acid and Calcium Oxalate in the skins (see <a href="am_taroz.html#oxa">Health &amp; 
Nutrition</a>). Cooking time is short, 10 to 15 minutes for 3/4 inch cubes, 
but it will hold its shape well if cooked a bit longer. Some people cook 
them skin-on and peel after when they're less slippery. In this case, the 
cooking water should be discarded.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp;  Boiling potatoes make an acceptable substitute 
in some recipes, but they will have a less silky texture, be less sweet, 
and take longer to cook. They cannot be used for things like Poi where 
exact flavor, texture and cooking properties are critical. Other than for 
Poi, <a href="am_malangz.html"><b>Malanga</b></a> makes 
an excellent substitute. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="oxa">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition - Oxalate</h2>

<p>Taro leaves, stems and corm skins all contain both soluble oxalic acid and 
sharp crystals of calcium oxalate, both types being serious health problems 
if not used with discretion.</p>

<p>Peeling and cooking the Taro corms removes the Oxalic Acid and 
Calcium Oxalate. This makes the corms harmless in even large quantities, 
demonstrated by the prevalence of Taro in the cuisines of Southeast Asia, 
and in particular the Pacific Island regions, including Hawaii.</p>
