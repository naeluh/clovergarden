<p><span class=bg>Animals, including people, have been found by genetic

<p>All of us complex animals are actually organized communities of a vast 
number of single cell animals,  bacteria and archaea, all with various 
degrees of specialization, independence and mobility. A little less than 
half the cells in our bodies are based on human DNA, but nearly all our 
weight is, as our <i>Eukaryote</i> cells are around 10,000 times larger 
than bacteria or archea cells.

<h3><a href="plants.html">Plants <small>&amp;</small> Animals</a></h3> 
stem from a common ancestor named LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor) 
which existed nearly 4 billion years ago. Complex <i>Eukaryote</i> cells 
developed about 2 billion years ago, and it was perhaps about 1.7 billion 
years ago that the Plant and Animal lineages separated. Both were still 
single celled, because multi-celular <i>Eukaryotes</i> first appeared 
about 1.4 billion years ago. About 1.2 billion years ago, 
<i>Eukaryote</i> cells began to adopt sexual reproduction, greatly 
accelerating the pace of evolution.<p></p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg id=opist>Opisthokonts</h2>

<p>About 1.3 billion years ago, after a number of intermeidate steps, 
complex <i>Opisthokont</i> cells had developed within the Animal lineage, 
<i>Podiata</i>. Perhaps 1.2 billion years ago, two populations of single 
celled <i>Opisthokonts</i> separately developed into complex 
multi-celular organisms, <b>Animals</b> and <a href="fungus.html">
<b>Fungus</b></a>.<p>

<p>Unlike oganisms in the Plant lineage, Opisthokonts cannot generate 
their own food from sunlight and raw materials, so both Animals and 
Fungi live by digesting other organisms, living and/or dead.</p>

<h2>Fungus</h2> 

<p>As the Fungi branched off from the Animal lineage (or vice versa), we 
have branched them off into their own 
<a href="fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</p>


<h2 id="kinds">Animals</h2>

<p><img src="img/fu_slime02h.jpg" alt="Slime Mold" class=mrg>

<b>How could a single celled proto-fungus evolve into animals?</b> 
That seems totally absurd - yet we have a current example of how it 
could happen. Slime molds are no longer considered fungus, but are  
similarly structured. They belong to the <i>Amoebozoa</i>, which are 
thought to have split from the animal lineage a little before the 
<i>Opisthokonts</i> evolved and split into animals and fungus. Ordinarily 
they are independent single cell entities, but when times are tough and 
it's time to move on, they assemble into a multi-cell creeping critter, 
an "animal" if you will, and head off to seek their fortune. Some cells 
modify themselves to fill particular roles, as we would expect from a 
proto-animal. <small>Slime mold photo by Dr. Jonathan Gott contributed 
to the Public Domain.
</small></p>

<p>We have not found a transition form between proto-fungus and animals, 
and it may be extinct, but we have stumbled on several other "extinct" 
transition forms, so it's possible we eventually will find one.</p>

<p>Here we present a chart of the edible animals. It follows their 
evolutionary descent but for simplicity we include only animal lines 
that are used by humans for food. Extinct lines are omitted (you can't 
eat those) as are intermediate evolutionary stages that aren't of culinary 
interest. All the first level entries were already in existence during 
the Cambrian era, about 530 million years ago. Very little is known 
about animal evolution in the Precambrian due to a very faint fossil 
record.</p>

<h2 id="who" class=lrg>Who Eats What Animals?</h2>

<p>Whether it's "right" (or healthy) to eat our fellow critters has been 
intensely debated for thousands of years with no resolution. Parrots have 
learned to talk (compose and speak meaningful sentences for their own 
purposes), less vocal animals have been shown to understand sentences.  
Ravens form clubs, use tools and can think out problems. Sociological 
studies show we're all pretty similar, so traditional notions of human 
exceptionalism and dominion over animals really don't wash.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's been shown that all animals, including ourselves, 
live by eating other living things, and many live exclusively on other 
animals, and in some cases animals of intellectual achievement superior to 
their own - so it's been pointed out this is the natural order. An order 
in which we participate - until something eats us.</p>

<p>So it all boils down to a matter of personal viewpoint, or the strictures 
of your religion (which is also a personal viewpoint). I was a vegetarian 
for some time (though not a very "ethical" one), and not at other times, 
so I'll make no condemnation one way or the other.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>North Americans</h3> are predominantly Christians, a powerful 
subtribe of the Pagans, and have no religious food prohibitions except 
for a few small sects that adhere more or less to Jewish law or promote 
vegetarianism. Most churches don't even forbid eating people (though 
it's rarely done).
<p>By secular law and/or custom, Americans are forbidden to eat dog, cat 
and horse. Just about everything else is fair game. These prohibitions 
have no logic but are the result of pressure by pet lovers. Pigs are 
smarter than dogs and cats, and can be just as friendly, and they're way 
smarter than horses, but are eaten in quantity by pet lovers because 
they're not cute and cuddly. The horsey set has even pressured government 
to forbid exporting horses to places that do eat horse, despite the fact 
that horses, in the wild, kill and eat smaller animals, and have killed 
and eaten people.</p>
<p>Of course North America includes vegetarians of every possible stripe, 
including a strong contingent of "vegans" who won't eat any animal or use 
any animal derived products for anything. Eggs, milk products and honey 
are off their menu because they amount to "exploiting animals". Of 
course, they have no strictures against exploiting people, ignoring that 
people are animals too.</p>
<p>The U.S. is also host to many large and strong immigrant communities and 
Native American communities, so an occasional cat, dog or horse does end up 
in the stew pot - you just have to be a little careful about who knows. 
The U.S. also hosts large contingents of Jews, Muslims, Hindus and 
other religious persuasions that follow their own dietary rules.</li>

<li><h3>Europeans</h3> are much like Americans but with some 
variations. The French, for instance, do eat horse, though it has 
declined in popularity, but it is still quite popular in southeastern 
Europe. I have it on good authority that the Germans ate plenty of cats 
during World War II, and the English ate some too (for cat, use any 
rabbit recipe, they cook and taste the same).
<p>Europe, due to past conquest of distant countries and importation of 
labor in times of worker shortage (especially Muslim Turks in Germany and 
Indians and Pakistanis in England) also has plenty of religious contingents 
following their own rules.</p></li>

<li><h3>Hinduism</h3> is a British "word of convenience" for 
a large number of schools of though in India, both Vedic and non-Vedic. 
While some sects are vegetarian, many Hindus do eat meat, though most 
don't eat cow. Cow is clearly not forbidden by the sacred Vedas (which 
provide guidance on eating them), but from later political / religious 
prohibitions inspired by the Krishna cult, anti-Islam sentiment and 
economics (better return on investment from milk than meat).
<p>Pig is not prohibited to meat eating Hindus but is rarely eaten due 
to pure economics (not enough high quality grains and vegetables to feed 
both the people and pigs) and due to a suspicion of the animal possibly 
picked up from other cultures. Pigs are eaten in northeastern areas 
influenced by China, and where wild pigs were traditionally hunted 
(Kodava and Tamil Nadu).</p>
<p>The main meat eaten by Hindus is goat, which British conquerors were 
pleased to call "mutton" so it would taste better. In areas of India 
influenced by Islam (north), lamb and mutton predominate for both Muslims 
and Hindus.</p>
<p>Hindus who eat meat avoid skin and fat - it is always removed before 
cooking.</p>
<p>Many Hindus are vegetarians of various degrees of purity. On the east 
coast they excuse fish and shellfish consumption by defining fish as fruit 
(fruit of the sea). On the west coast many won't eat anything that 
even suggests meat and go to great effort not to harm insects or even 
"nosee'ems".</p>
<p>Brahmans, the highest Hindu cast, are supposed to adhere to the 
"Brahman diet" (introduced to Americans by the Hari Krishna folks), 
which forbids any meat, onions, garlic, shallots, or mushrooms - but in 
Kashmir Brahmans eat meat, but not cow.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Buddhists</h3> are supposed to 
go through life "doing no harm", so some sects are vegetarians. Their 
presence in China, Japan, Tibet and Southeast Asia has provided those 
area with a good number of excellent vegetarian recipes. Of course, in 
Tibet, vegetarianism is often almost impossible.
<p>In Southeast Asia, where Theravada Buddhism predominates, animals are 
widely eaten, but priests are expected to be vegetarian. Since they live 
entirely by begging, there is an escape clause. Strict Buddhists may 
accept meat <b>provided</b> it was not in any way prepared for them or 
as a result of them - in other words, they did no harm. If you invite 
a strict Buddhist to dinner, you are responsible for providing vegetarian 
food and no meat will be accepted. If, on the other hand, the Buddhist 
showed up completely unexpectedly and meat was what there was, you could 
offer it and it may be accepted, or may not.</p>
<p>Of course in the U.S. we have traditional Buddhists of all sects plus any 
number of varieties of half baked "Buddhists" who follow any set of rules 
they fancy. If they think they're getting off the wheel of Karma that 
way they may have to rethink in their next life, but, hey, life's not all 
that bad, really.</p></li>

<li><h3>Jews</h3> have a strict set of dietary guidelines, the 
Kosher laws (<a href="animal.html#a3">A3</a>), which are adhered to more or less 
strictly depending on the sect of Judaism a person belongs to and personal 
viewpoint. Kosher is an anglicized form of Hebrew <i>kasher</i> which means 
"fit" or "proper".
<p>Pig is completely forbidden for eating, but the Jews are not pathological 
about pig like the Muslims are - you can sell them, use leather made from 
them, just not eat them.</p>
<p>Edible animals must chew a cud and have a cloven hoof: cattle, antelope, 
buffalo, bison, deer, eland, gazelle, goat, hart, moose, ox, sheep 
and yak. - though certain parts (brain, major nerves, etc.) are forbidden 
as well as any blood at all - thus killing and salting (koshering) rules 
must be strictly followed.</p>
<p>Forbidden are: camel, dog, dolphin, donkey, horse, pig, porpoise, 
rabbit, hyrax, rodents, whale, all reptiles, frogs, lizards, snakes, 
turtles, toads, all insects (except certain locusts 
(<a href="animal.html#a5">A5</a>)) and other invertebrates, and crocodiles (though 
now known to not be reptiles but related to birds they still don't 
qualify).</p>
<p>Edible birds must have a projecting claw, a crop and a gizzard the 
inner lining of which can be peeled away: chicken, Cornish hen, duck, 
dove, goose, pigeon, songbirds and turkey.</p>
<p>Forbidden birds are wild birds and birds of prey: eagle, heron, 
ostrich, owl, pelican, stork, swan, vulture, raven and crow.</p>
<p>Edible fish must have both fins and scales that can be removed without 
breaking the skin: anchovy, bass, blackfish, bluefish, butterfish, carp, 
chub, cod, flounder, fluke, haddock, halibut, herring, mackerel, mahimahi, 
mullet, perch, pickerel, pike, pompano, porgy, red snapper, sablefish, 
salmon, sardine, shad, smelt, snapper, sole, tilefish, trout, tuna, 
weakfish, whitefish and whiting.</p>
<p>Among forbidden fish are: catfish, eel, lamprey, marlin, rays, puffer, 
sailfish, shark, sturgeon, swordfish and turbot.</p>
<p>Forbidden seafoods are all shellfish and mollusks, including: clam, 
lobster, octopus, oyster, scallop, squid, shrimp and snail (the popularity 
of expensive sushi bars among Jewish professionals in Los Angeles and what 
they eat there is strictly between them and their rabbi).</p>
<p>Milk products and meat must not be mixed nor eaten at the same meal, 
and separate cooking utensils are required for the two.</p>
<p>In general, great care must be taken to insure that no kosher food is 
in any way contaminated by or comes in contact with any non-kosher food 
or substance, or machinery and utensils that have.</p>
<p>The primary purpose for all these rules was to make Jews so different 
from other peoples they could not mingle with them. These rules are so 
effective in that regard that the majority of North American Jews have 
come to ignore them in part or in whole.</li>

<li><h3>Muslims</h3> follow Islamic food law which is derived 
from the Jewish kosher law and is very similar but particularly sticks 
at pig in any shape form manner or use. Acceptable foods are called 
<i>Halal</i> (lawful), unacceptable are <i>haram</i> (unlawful) and 
questionable items are <i>mushbooh</i> (suspected) and should not be 
consumed (<a href="animal.html#a4">A4</a>).
<p>Alcohol and other intoxicants are strictly forbidden - though the 
Turks seem to have received a special dispensation from Allah on this 
item - either that or they're all going straight to Hell with the rest 
of us. Because a literal reading of the Koran forbids "wine", some 
Muslims feel free to drink arak (a hard liquor similar to Greek ouzo) 
and beer.</p>
<p>All halal animals must be properly slaughtered and must not have been 
dead before slaughter. No animal that was killed in the name of anyone 
other than Allah is acceptable. As you might expect, halal meat is 
extra expensive, and there is fraud.</p></li>

<li><h3>Chinese</h3> (other than the Buddhists) are very big 
on eating animals. They particularly favor pig, chicken and duck. Beef 
and fish are also used, and Lamb and Mutton in the Muslim regions. In 
the Southeast, they'll stop at nothing (fried scorpions, anyone? 
Tarantulas?). Recently, restaurants there were promoting rat, because 
they'd already served all the snakes that had been eating the rats - 
so plenty of rats.

<p>Chinese saying, "The Cantonese will eat anything with legs except a 
table, and anything with wings except an airplane".  Actually, this 
underestimates the Cantonese - they are perfectly fine with eating things 
that have neither legs nor wings. There is now some conflict between 
Northern China and Southeast China. Many northerners have adopted a 
Western attitude towards cats and dogs as pets, while they are still 
eating them in the southeast.</p>

<p>Chinese Buddhists are supposed to be strictly vegetarian. Buddhist 
monks in this region grow and process their own food so they can avoid 
meat entirely. This extends down into Vietnam, but only 12% of 
Vietnamese are Buddhist, there are a few Christians, and the rest 
are Pagans.</p></li>

<li><h3>Korea</h3> is big on beef, fish, and 
moderately hot chilis. Pork is also used, and everything is served with 
rice and kimchee (pickled cabbage (and/or other vegetables) usually with 
red chili, but sometimes not).<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Japan</h3> is a land of two major religions, Shinto, the 
indigenous religion, and Zen Buddhism, originally imported from Korea. 
To my knowledge, Shinto has no restrictions on eating animals. Zen 
Buddhism at one time forbade (by command of the Emperor) eating animals 
except fish and birds, but in later times Japanese Zen has 
de-emphasized vegetarianism, though it is still respected. These two 
religions are now so intertwined the saying is, "You're born Shinto, 
and die Buddhist".
<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Southeast Asia:</h3> &nbsp; While Buddhists in Vietnam 
adhere to Chinese Buddhism, they account for only 12% of the population. 
The vast majority adhere to the indigenous Pagan / Animist religion with 
dashes of Confucianism and Buddhism added. Any restrictions on eating 
animals are local. Thailand is 93% Theravada Buddhist, but in much of 
the country this Buddhism is strongly influenced by indigenous Pagan / 
Animist religion and Hinduism. Pretty much all animals are on the menu. 
In Laos it's 66% Theraveda and  31% Pagan / Animist, but again, the 
Buddhism is heavily influenced by the indiginous religion. Cambodia is 
97% Theravada Buddhist, but with strong traditional influence from 
Hinduism. There are no restrictions on eating animals except those 
followed by priests.<p></p></li>
