<h1>Annona</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Custard Apple family (<i>Annonaceae</i>) is a large family of 
tropical and subtropical shrubs, trees and vines. Two genera, Annona and 
Asimina, are significant producers of edible fruit. These large, soft, 
thin skinned and often faceted or warted fruits are difficult to ship so 
are consumed mostly where they grow. The Cherimoya, however, is grown in 
California and commonly available in U.S. markets - often at high prices. 
Even where I shop they're often well over US $3 / pound so I shudder to 
think what they might cost in the yuppie emporiums.</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Fruit producing members of the <i>Annonaceae</i> family all originated 
in the Americas. The tropical species were quickly distributed all over 
the tropical world by explorers and traders in the 16th century because 
the seeds are large, reasonably long lived and the fruit is highly 
desirable.</p>
<p>The seeds, bark and leaves are toxic but have a number of medicinal 
uses and are used as natural insecticides.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>Not every <i>Annonaceae</i> that bares edible fruit is listed here, 
but these are the ones commercially exploited over a wide area. There 
are others used locally in Central and South America.</p>

<h2>Atymoya</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_atemoya1k.jpg" alt="Whole Atymoya Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Annona cherimola x squamosa</i>]
<p>
The Atymoya, a deliberate cross between a Cherimoya and a Sweetsop, is  
considered one of the best eating Annonas. It is currently grown mostly in 
Florida where it was developed but has been found suitable to coastal 
areas of Southern California so may become more common here.

Iwo (Erhe); Awerewa, Ehiri, Airama, Muscadier de Calabash, Lubushi; 
<i>Monodora myristica</i>]
<p>
This member of the Custard Apple family is native to evergreen forests 
of West Africa from Liberia, south to Angola and east to Uganda. It 
is also now grown in the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is present 
in Central and South America. It produces large spherical fruit up to 
nearly 8 inches diameter. Embedded in the aromatic pulp are up to 120 
plump seeds up to 1.0 inches long. These are shelled and the interior 
dried and ground for use in the same ways as nutmeg. They are also used 
medicinally.

<h2>Cherimoya</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_chery02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Cherimoya" class=mrg>
[<i>Annona cherimola</i>]
<p>
Believed to have originated in the valleys of northwestern South America, 
the cherimoya has been grown in California since 1871. The heart shaped 
fruit generally weigh between 6 ounces and 1 pound but can get up to 5 
pounds. The photo specimen was 3-1/4 inches across and weighed 1/2 pound.
The skin is thin and may be covered with fingerprint like indentations as 
in the photo (most common), or may have protrubances like the Atymoya 
pictured here. The flesh is white, creamy, fragrant and with just 
a touch of tartness. It's best just eaten out of the skin with a spoon, 
dealing with the many seeds as you encounter them. The seeds are quite 
toxic but so hard they cause no harm if accidentally swallowed.</p>
<p><b>Buying:</b> Buy fruit that is firm, unblemished and heavy for it's 
size. Set it on a counter out of the sunlight and let it ripen until it 
has some give like an almost ripe avocado. Give it one more day after 
that and then store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days if you aren't 
going to eat it right then and there. If left out to get overripe it 
will begin to ferment.

<h2 id="cust">Custard Apple</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_custapple01e.jpg" alt="Custard Apple, Inside and Outside" class=mrg>
[<i>Annona reticulata</i>]
<p>
Thought to have originated in the West Indies, the custard apple was 
transported all around the world by traders in the 16th century. Requiring 
a moist tropical climate it can not be grown in California and is a bit 
marginal even in Florida. Custard apple fruit is pleasant tasting but 
considered inferior to the Cherimoya and Sweetsop. In India it is eaten only 
by the lower classes but is not class sensitive in the rest of the world. It 
is often pressed through a sieve and added to ice cream and milk shakes or 
blended with other fruit such as bananas.

<h2>Llama</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_llama01k.jpg" alt="Llama Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Annona diversifolia</i> alt <i>A. macroprophyllata</i>]
<p>
This tree is native to the west coast of Central America, but a few 
are grown in Florida. The fruit, which can be nearly 6 inches diameter 
and weight up to 2 pounds, is slightly elongated and studded with 
shallow triangular protrubences. The rind may be pale green to pink or 
purple and covered with a velvety light gray bloom. The fruit is variable 
from juicy to rather dry with slightly tart flesh which will be 
white in green fruit to rose in pink or purple fruit. Yield is uncertain 
so it's unlikely to become commercially exploited to any great degree.

[Prairie Banana, Kentucky Banana, Ozark Banana; <i>Asimina triloba</i>]
<p>
A temperate zone tree native to the Southeast USA. The thin skinned 
fruit, yellow to brownish when ripe, is smooth and shaped roughly like a 
plump mango, 3 to 6 inches long and weighing up to a pound. The flesh is 
creamy and ranges in flavor between banana and mango depending on 
cultivar. Paw Paw is not yet a commercial crop but is being developed as 
one with some success - uncertain pollination is a problem. Growers 
sometimes resort to hanging rotting chicken necks in the orchards to 
attract the blow flies and carrion beetles this plant depends on for 
pollination. Shipping is another problem so the fruits are often pulped 
and the pulp frozen for shipment. <b>Note:</b> In Australia the name 
"Pawpaw" is used for mangos.

<h2>Pond Apple</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_pond03h.jpg" alt="Pond Apples on Tree" class=mrg>
[Alligator apple, Monkey apple; <i>Annona glabra</i>]
<p>
Pond Apple is native to the West Indies and grows wild all over the 
Caribbean area and prolifically in the Florida Everglades. Unfortunately 
it isn't considered as good eating as other Annonas and the yellow 
flesh is said to be narcotic. The smooth skinned oblong fruits, between 
3 and 6 inches long, are eaten fresh locally and made into jam and wine 
but this fruit is not exploited commercially. Pond apple is often used 
for root stock on which to grow other species because the roots are 
extremely tolerant of flooding. Pond apple root stock imported for 
grafting has escaped and become perhaps the worst invasive pest plant 
in northern Australia. Meanwhile they're trying to restore pond apple 
habitat in Florida.

<img src="img/ca_soursop09e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Soursop" class=mrg></a>
[Guanabana (Spanish); Graviola (Brazil); <i>Annona muricata</i>]
<p>
Native to the West Indies, soursop is now the most grown Annona 
throughout the tropics.  The fruits are relatively large, up to 12 inches 
long and 6 inches in diameter, thin skinned and covered with tiny spines 
which rub off easily. The larger photo specimen was 6 inches long, 3-3/4 
inches diameter and weighed 6-3/4 ounces.</p>
<p>Most soursop is processed into ice cream, sherbets and beverages. The 
flesh is a trace fibrous and there are a lot of seeds, but the flavor is 
intensely floral and quite enjoyable. It has been described as like 
Strawberry and Pineapple with notes of Citrus and Coconut or Banana. 
The fruit has a sweet-sour balance similar to Tamarind.

<h2>Sweetsop</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_swsop04e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Sugar Apple" class=mrg>
[Sugar Apple, Anon; <i>Annona squamosa</i>]
<p>
The Sugar Apple is the most widely grown Annona species. It's origin is 
uncertain but possibly around the Caribbean basin. It was carried 
worldwide by traders in the 16th century. Requiring a wet tropical or near 
tropical environment. sweetsop is not grown in California due to cold 
winters but a few are grown in Florida. The fruit is generally just broken 
apart into segments and the creamy flesh stripped from the seeds in the 
mouth. The seeds are quite toxic but are so hard they will cause no harm 
if accidentally swallowed. The photo specimen, from an Asian market in 
Los Angeles and mislabeled custard apple, was previously frozen.

<h2>Marolo</h2>
<br><img src="img/ca_marolo01k.jpg" alt="Marolo Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Araticum do cerrado; <i>Annona crassiflora</i>]
<p>
This fruit grows wild in the tropical savanna of Brazil and Paraguay and 
is eaten by native peoples. While not yet cultivated, it is receiving 
increased interest from the food industry for inclusion, in the form of 
flour, in snack bars. It is sweet and high in vitamin C, minerals, 
antioxidants and dietary fiber.

<h2>Selim Pepper</h2>

[Grains of Selim, Senegal pepper, Kimba pepper, African pepper, 
Moor pepper, Negro pepper, Kani pepper, Kili pepper, Ethiopian pepper; 
Djar (Wolof, Senegal); Poivre de S&eacute;n&eacute;gal (French); 
Kieng (Cameroon); Hwentea (Ga - Ghana); Chimba (North Ghana);
<i>Xylopia aethiopica</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Xylopia striata</i>
similar but larger -  both of family <i>Annonaceae</i>]
<p>
This spice is totally unrelated to the Pepper Family (Piperaceae) or 
even the Pepper Order (<i>Piperales</i>). It is used for similar 
purposes as those peppers, but is much more aromatic. It is native to 
much of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal across to Ethiopia, and as 
far south as Tanzania, with Ghana the largest producer. It is thought 
to have originated in Ethiopia, but is particularly important in 
Senegal on the coast of West Africa.
