<h1>Camel</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
[Jamal (Arabic); Ngamia (Swahili); <i>Camelus dromedarius</i>]
<p><span class=bg>
While Bactrian camels (two humps) are eaten at times, the prferred eating 
camel is the Dromedary (one hump). They are slaughtered between 4 and 10 
years old, but as the camel ages, its meat becomes tougher and less flavorful.
</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Camel is eaten in  Eritrea, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, 
Syria, Libya, Sudan, and Kazakhstan, and particularly in Somalia and Djibouti 
where it is a staple of the cuisine. In ancient Persia, camels were often 
spit roasted whole. Camel is also sometimes eaten in Australia, and exported 
from there, mostly to the Near East, but also to the U.S. and 
Europe. Australian camels are feral, not farmed, so the flavor is different.

<h3>Camel meat</h3> is a red meat that tastes similar to Beef, but is somewhat 
coarser in texture. It is also a little sweeter, due to high glycogen content, 
similar to Horse meat. Meat from older camels can be very tough and take long 
cooking to be suitable for the table. The hump contains large amounts of white 
fat, which is often used to preserve meats, camel and other.

<h3>Camel Milk</h3> is very important for some peoples, and key to the 
survival of nomads in desert regions. It is, however, difficult to make butter 
from camel milk, but some butter is made. It is difficult to get camel milk to 
coagulate into curds to make cheese, but experiments have been done and some 
is now produced commercially in Mauritania.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> Camel Meat, Milk, and Hump Fat are available from North 
American producers. Look for them on-line. These products are also available 
in Australia.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking</h3> &nbsp; Camel meat is used in dishes from African cuisines. 
It is commonly included with vegetables in stews or in rice dishes, such as 
the Biryani in the photo. It is generally wet cooked due to toughness, and 
how long depends on age.
