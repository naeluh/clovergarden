Dogs and Cats are the signature families of the two suborders of the 
order <i>Carnivora</i>: <i>Caniformia</i> and <i>Feliformia</i>.</span> 
Carnivora means "Meat Eaters" and while both these families are fierce 
killers by nature they have learned to exploit humans for food and shelter 
without actually eating them. Sometimes, however, the tables are turned 
and they are turned out on the table. &nbsp;

<p>Note: &nbsp; some scientists consider Hyenas a third suborder (and 
strange beasts they are), but most lump them in with cats in 
<i>Feliformia</i>.

<h2 id="cuts" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>I make no moral judgement as to whether people <i>should</i> eat 
dog or cat, or any other animal for that matter - that is for each of 
you to decide on your own. If you have decided to eat any animals, I see 
little difference between any one and another so long as they have been 
raised for food in a respectful manner and were humanely killed. I do 
not agree with eating animals that have been treated as pets - that's 
a betrayal of trust.</p>
<p>Both dog and cat are forbidden by Jewish and Islamic food law since 
acceptable meat must come from animals that both have split hoofs and 
chew a cud.</p>

<h2 id="dog" class=lrg>Dog</h2>

<p><img src="img/ao_dog01h.jpg" alt="St Bernards" class=mrg>
Dog has been a common menu item particularly in Korea but also in parts 
of China, Southeast Asia, some Indonesian islands and occasionally in 
Native American communities. In French Polynesia dog was long the only 
available meat animal, and it was much enjoyed in Paris during the 
Franco-Prussian war. Dog butcher shops still existed in Paris at least 
until 1910 (rumors are it is still served in some parts of Paris). &nbsp; 
<small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0150</a></small>.</p>

<p>Of course, with a large Asian population, dog is eaten in California, 
but not openly. A couple of annoying yapping dogs in the neighboring 
condos became suddenly silent, but, hey, the folks may have moved, I 
don't know.</p>

<p>I confess I've never eaten either dog or cat, but the Parisian 
literati in 1870 said it was light pink and delicious. Westerners who 
have sampled dog meat recently, variously describe it as similar to 
mutton, a bit fatty tasting and a bit chewy. It is mostly used in soups 
and stews.</p>

<p>All this outrages pet lovers but makes logical sense. Dogs are less 
intelligent and more dangerous than pigs, which can be just as friendly 
and sociable, yet most pet lovers eat pig regularly.</p>

<p>In China, a cottage industry has long bred dogs for flavor (Chow dog 
anyone?), but large commercial operations are now developing, 
particularly breeding St Bernards with local breeds to provide a 
desirable combination of size, growth, disease resistance and lots of 
lean meat. This has, of course, produced screams of outrage from the 
Swiss.</p>

<p>Major, and certainly legitimate complaints against Korean dog eating 
are that the animals are raised under inhumane and unsanitary conditions 
and are tortured to death by hanging and beating with bats. That's said 
to tenderize them and improve flavor. As of 2018 animal welfare laws have 
been brought to bear, and the courts have ruled it illegal to kill dogs 
for food. It's probably still done and will be for some time - food 
traditions are very persistent.</p>

<h3>Dog Relatives</h3>, such as bears, raccoons, seals, sea 
lions, weasels, otters and badgers are  eaten in various North American 
regions but are treated separately under game animals. All of them, and 
dogs as well, must be cooked by the rules for pork, because they can all 
be carriers of trichinosis (as can humans).<p></p> 


<h2 id="cat" class=lrg>Cat</h2>

<p><img src="img/ao_cat01k.jpg" alt="White Cat" class=mrg>
Cat has been an emergency food in Europe, consumed when other supplies are 
short. It is a more common item of consumption in East Asia and Southeast 
Asia, though much less so than dog - except in the Guangdong region of China. 
Cat is common in Cantonese cuisine, to the distress of the northern Chinese 
who have recently adopted a Western attitude towards cats as pets and 
companions. &nbsp; 
<small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0149</a></small>.</p>

<p>The common house cat can be used in any rabbit recipe and tastes about the 
same, to the extent the standard reference <i>Larousse Gastronomiqe</i> 
includes comparative illustrations of the bones so you can tell which you 
are being served, if that matters to you.</p>
<p>I have first hand corroboration from a WWII Luftwafe 
antiaircraft gunner that this substitution works fine.
In England also, cat was featured as "roof rabbit" during WWII.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><blockquote>Oh kittens, in our hours of ease
<br>Uncertain toys and full of fleas,
<br>When pain and anguish hang o'er men,
<br>We turn you into sausage then</blockquote>

<p>As for larger cats, zoo keepers who've had to shoot a lion now and 
then testify that lion is delicious (and again, similar to rabbit), but 
it's way too expensive to appear in your local supermarket. Lion is 
available from an exotic meat perveyor in Southern California. He's taken 
a lot of flack for this, but he gets it from a farm in the Midwest that 
raises lions for their pelts. Before he started buying it, it was fed 
to dogs.</p>

<h3>Cat Relatives</h3>, mostly civets and palm civets, are 
eaten in China and Southeast Asia, and are suspected of introducing 
dangerous viral diseases to humans (the recent SARS outbreak). They are 
captured wild and not raised under controlled conditions.<p></p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health Considerations</h2>

<p>As with all other animals that are not strictly vegetarian, dog and cat 
provide a high risk of trichinosis, a parasitic worm infection that can 
sometimes be deadly or debilitating. Dog and cat should always be thoroughly 
cooked to an internal temperature of 165&deg;F/70&deg;C before consuming.
