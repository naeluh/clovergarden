<p><span class=bg>Though perhaps a fitting reward for telemarketers who call during 
dinnertime, I don't recommend eating humans, but include them for 
completeness. They do end up on the dinner table now and then. 
</span></p>

<p>The biggest problem with eating human is that it's not sold in stores, 
so you first have to go out and kill one. Despite absence from the 
endangered species list, killing humans is dangerous and <u>highly 
illegal</u> under most circumstances. Then you have to clean and butcher 
the human yourself, a task for which most home kitchens are not well 
equipped. Finally, there are the difficult questions to answer when the 
police investigators arrive.</p>
<p>Beyond all this there are some very significant health considerations.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Eating humans, called "cannibalism", has generally been associated with 
religious ritual or extreme hunger. In either case, culinary considerations 
are rather secondary. False accusations of cannibalism have been common 
throughout history as a means of de-humanizing some population that was 
not liked or to justify exploiting or destroying that population. Even 
reports of ritual cannibalism by the Aztecs are now seriously in 
question.</p>

<p>On the other hand, long pig is still on the menu in some places - 
though the dish is in decline. In New Guinea, Japanese troops during 
WWII followed local custom in eating roast Australian soldier. The 
last really notable person New Guinea natives ate was Michael Rockefeller 
(Smithsonian, March 2014) - they've mostly been converted to Christianity 
now, a religion that frowns on eating long pig, but does not forbid it 
(declared by the Pope in 1972, after the Andes plane crash).</p>

<p>There are occasional reports from Nigeria of eating humans, and in 
February, 2014, a hotel restaurant in Anambra state was closed by 
authorities for serving human. Two fresh heads were found, and 11 
people were arrested (IBTimes, UK).</p>

<p>The only reasonably authortative report I know of as to taste and 
texture of human is that of New York Times reporter William Seabrook. He 
reported it was very much like veal, a little tougher, a little stringier 
and with a somewhat more mature flavor. His description sounds a lot like 
the new "free range" veal popular with the chef set, and, if his 
description is reliable, that should be an acceptable substitute in any 
recipe calling for human. Others, though, say it's more like pork, and 
the structure of the meat is reported by scientists to be similar to that 
of pork, so take your pick.<p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health Considerations</h2>

<p>Humans are essentially wild animals, not raised under the tightly 
controlled conditions typical of our industrialized agriculture. They are 
free to contract various diseases and many of these diseases are 100% 
transmittable to other humans who consume them.</p>
<p>Among these diseases are Trichinosis, Hepatitis and HIV (AIDS). Trichinosis 
is more widespread than most people realize because it is often asymptomatic, 
but AIDS is a much more serious risk. Many other more or less severe diseases 
and parasitic infections can be contracted.</p>
<p>Human should always be well cooked to an internal temperature of at 
least 165&deg;F/70&deg;C before consuming, and brains should probably be 
avoided altogether (unless you are already a zombie).</p>
