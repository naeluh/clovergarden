<h1>Bacon</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Perhaps the most popular and delicious cured pork product is bacon - 
salt cured and usually smoked pork belly, Many favor it with an almost 
religious devotion. There is also Back Bacon, called "bacon" in the British 
Isles and much of Canada, and called "Canadian bacon" here. It is more like 
a bland ham than like real bacon and is not worthy of religious devotion 

<p>It has been said, "Bacon: proof there is a God - and that he hates Jews 
and Muslims". There is simply no way to make even acceptable bacon, never 
mind delicious, from cows, sheep goats or camels. The closest you can get 
is with chicken and fish, but that's still very, very far away.<p>

<p>A bit ago, I think it was 2017, a Vegan organization scheduled a big 
protest at a Texas bacon festival. Hardly anyone showed up, probably 
fearing the smell of bacon would break them.

<h2>Bacon</h2>

[Streaky Bacon (GB, Canada)]
<p>
When we say just "bacon" in the United States, this sliced product is 
what we mean. It is pork belly, salt cured, smoked and sliced. It may be 
"thick sliced" or "regular", but even thick sliced is rather thin. In 
my opinion, it's too thin for many recipe uses. On the other hand, sliced 
is essential for a lot of other recipes - though I'd generally still recommend 
the "thick sliced". Typically, slices are 10-1/2 inches long, 2 inches wide 
and 0.12 inch thick (thick sliced).  Flavor, thickness and leanness vary 
considerably with brand, so find one you like.

<h2>Canadian Bacon / Back Bacon</h2>

<p>[Short Cut Bacon (Australia); Back Rashers (Ireland); Irish Bacon (US) | 
similar: Peameal Bacon (Canada - parts)]
</p><p>
When they say just "bacon" in England, Ireland and much of Canada, this 
is what is meant. What we know as bacon in the United States is called 
"streaky bacon" in those benighted regions. This product is made from 
center-cut boneless pork loin (where we get pork chops from). It may be 
salt cured or salt cured and smoked like our bacon, then sliced. 
Comparatively, it is generally dry and disappointing in flavor, tasting 
more like ham than real bacon.  Loin is the least flavorful meat on the 
pig and there's not enough fat to compensate for that.

<h2>Peameal Bacon</h2>
<br><a href="ap_baconbz.html"> 
<img src="img/ap_baconpm01e.jpg" alt="Loaves of Bacon" class=mrg></a>
Sold in parts of Canada, this product is eye of center cut pork loin 
given a sweet pickle cure and is not smoked. It is called "peameal" 
because it was traditionally rolled in meal made from yellow peas, but 
today it's usually cornmeal. The photo specimens, from Toronto, Canada, 
are roasted and drizzled with a honey glaze.

[Streaky Bacon (GB, Canada)]
<p>
This is simply regular bacon before slicing. It's generally a deli 
product of special quality and somewhat higher price. The photo specimen 
was purchased from the deli department of a large multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles for US $6.19 / pound, compared to the regular specimen above 
purchased from a discount market at $4.65 / pound. It was 8 inches long 
and 2 inches thick at the thick end.

<h2>Ends and Pieces</h2>
<br><a href="ap_baconz.html">
<img src="img/ap_baconep05e.jpg" alt="Random Pieces of Bacon" class=mrg></a>
Unfortunately, pigs are not perfectly rectangular, so producing those 
trays of thin uniform slices involves a lot of trimming at the edges. 
These trimmings are packaged and sold through some markets. They tend 
to be sliced a lot thicker and usually are leaner than sliced bacon. 
This is the way I buy nearly all my bacon, because I use it mostly in 
recipes where sliced is really too thin. I buy Bar-M brand (produced by 
Serve-Rite Meat Co in Los Angeles) which has excellent smoky flavor.

<h2>Smoked Pork Ribs</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_ribsmk03d.jpg" alt="Block of Smoked Pork Side" class=mrg>
You want flavor? We have flavor, right here. The photo specimen is from 
one end of a slice of pork side about 3-3/4 inches wide and 2-1/2 inches 
thick. The whole piece was about 14 inches long and cut from the spare 
ribs part of the pig. The slice includes the ribs, bacon layer and skin. 
It's bacon cured and strongly smoked. Roasted it is awesome. Roasting 
method right here: &nbsp;

<h2>Pancetta</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_pancet02h.jpg" alt="Thick Slice of Pancetta" class=mrg>
[Italian Bacon]
<p>
This is pork belly rolled up into a cylinder and given a salt cure, but it 
is not smoked. This product is often called for in Italian recipes and is 
commonly available in the service deli of well stocked meat markets. Subst: 
Salt Pork.

<h2>Chinese Bacon</h2>
<br><a href="ap_baconcz.html"> 
<img src="img/ap_baconch02d.jpg" alt="Chinese Bacon slices" class=mrg></a>
[Lop yok, Laap yuk (China)]
<p>
This is an intense product usually cut in small pieces to add to soups 
and stir fries as a flavoring element. It is often fairly strongly 
flavored with cinnamon and/or star anise. It may be smoked or not. It 
is meant to be cooked before being eaten. The photo specimens, purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, were made by Prime Foods in 
New York, so were probably unleaded and contained no melamine.</p>
<p>The larger of the photo specimens was 10-1/2 inches long, 2-1/2 
inches wide and 0.8 inch thick. Note that the skin is on and is used 
along with the rest. Ingredients: pork belly, sugar, soy sauce, thick 
soy sauce, Mei Kwe Lu liquor (distilled from sorghum and roses) salt, 
msg, cinnamon, spice, sodium nitrite.

<h2>Hungarian Bacon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_baconh05h.jpg" alt="Hungarian bacon block" class=mrg>
The definitive characteristic of Hungarian bacon are that it is slab bacon 
that has been cooked sufficiently to be sliced and eaten without further 
cooking. It is sometimes made thick, as in the photo specimen which is 2 
inches thick, by sticking together two slabs. It may also be a single slab 
with the rind still on, essential for Gypsy Bacon. It is often rubbed with 
paprika and garlic, as in the photo, but also may be rubbed with black 
pepper and garlic.
