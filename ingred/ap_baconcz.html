[Lop yok, Laap yuk (China)]
<p>
   This is an intense product usually cut in small pieces to add to soups 
   and stir fries as a flavoring element. It is often fairly strongly 
   flavored with cinnamon and/or star anise. It may be smoked or not. It 
   is meant to be cooked before being eaten. The photo specimens, purchased 
   from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, were made by Prime Foods in 
   New York, so were probably unleaded and contained no melamine.</p>
   <p>The larger of the photo specimens was 10-1/2 inches long, 2-1/2 
   inches wide and 0.8 inch thick. Note that the skin is on and is used 
   along with the rest. Ingredients: pork belly, sugar, soy sauce, thick 
   soy sauce, Mei Kwe Lu liquor (distilled from sorghum and roses), salt, 
   msg, cinnamon, spice, sodium nitrite.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product can be found in most Asian markets. 
Tightly vacuum packed, it will generally not be refrigerated. Formulas, 
appearance and shelf stability vary widely.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Although it is unrefrigerated at the store, I 
keep it in the fridge if it will be long before use. Of course, once 
opened, it should be tightly wrapped, refrigerated, and consumed within 
a week or so as it may be subject to mold.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The package will usually tell you to steam it to an 
internal temperature of 166&deg;F/75&deg;C before using, but Chinese bacon 
affectionado Chichi Wang says it's much better to soak it in cold water 
for 5 hours or up to a day for much better softening. Then cook it in 
whatever recipe you wish to use.<p></p>  

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This product is generally cut into small pieces 
and included in stir fries, salads, with vegetables or whatever. Just do 
the soak ahead of time so it's reasonably soft.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese sausage, which are commonly available, will 
probably do, but there are some Chinese ham pieces cured much like this 
bacon that would be better, if available.<p></p>
