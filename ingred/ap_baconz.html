<h1>Bacon - Streaky Bacon</h1>

<p>
   When we say just "bacon" in the United States, this sliced product is 
   what we mean. It is pork belly, salt cured, smoked and sliced. It may 
   be "thick sliced" or "regular", but even thick sliced is rather thin. 
   In my opinion, it's too thin for many recipe uses. On the other hand, 
   sliced is essential for a lot of other recipes - though I'd generally 
   still recommend the "thick sliced". Typically, slices are 10-1/2 
   inches long, 2 inches wide and 0.12 inch thick (thick sliced).  
   Flavor, thickness and leanness vary considerably with brand, so 
   find one you like.</p>

<h2>Slab Bacon</h2>

   This is simply regular bacon before slicing. It's generally a deli product 
   of special quality and somewhat higher price. The photo specimen was 
   purchased from the deli department of a large multi-ethnic market in Los 
   Angeles for  US $6.19 / pound, compared to the regular specimen above 
   purchased from a discount market at $4.65 / pound. It was 8 inches long 
   and 2 inches thick at the thick end.

<h2>Ends and Pieces</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_baconep05g.jpg" alt="Pile of Bacon Pieces" class=mrg>
   Unfortunately, pigs are not perfectly rectangular, so producing those 
   trays of thin uniform slices involves a lot of trimming at the edges. 
   These trimmings are packaged and sold through some markets. They tend 
   to be sliced a lot thicker and usually are leaner than sliced bacon. 
   This is the way I buy nearly all my bacon, because I use it mostly in 
   recipes where sliced is really too thin. I buy Bar-M brand (produced by 
   Serve-Rite Meat Co in Los Angeles) which has excellent smoky flavor.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; In the United States (and much of Canada), sliced 
bacon will be found in just about any market that sells any meat at all.
Slab bacon will be found in the deli department of most markets that 
have a full service deli. Ends and pieces will be found in many markets 
that sell meat, but by no means all. Quality varies by manufacturer. 
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Vacuum packed bacon will keep a month at least. 
Once opened it will probably start to mold within a week or so, sooner 
if not wrapped air tight. If there's just a little blue-green mold, it 
can be scraped off. If it's orange mold, discard the bacon.<P></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Cut to the size you want.<p></p>  

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Sliced bacon is generally fried, preferably in 
a little bacon fat or lard. For best flavor it should be fried only 
partially crisp. Fast food outfits fry theirs all crisp because it is 
then eternal like cardboard and easy to handle, but it tastes kind of 
like cardboard too.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Bacon is the only real substitute for bacon, but 
in some recipes where it doesn't play a major roll, Canadian bacon or ham 
can be used. If you're Muslim or an observant Jew, your best bet is 
conversion to a different religion.<p></p>
