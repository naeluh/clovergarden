<h1>Pork Shoulder Boston Butt</h1>

[#406]
<p>
This is the top portion of the shoulder from the backbone down to the 
top of the <a href="ap_shouldz.html">Picnic Shoulder</a>, including the 
shoulder blade. It may be sold skin-on but is more commonly without skin 
</p>

<p>The term "butt" has nothing to do with the rear end of the pig, this 
is the front shoulder. Some say it was called "Boston Butt" because it 
was packed in a barrel called a "butt" but I think that's reaching.

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the most common cuts of pork and 
can be found in any meat market that sells pork.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The most common way for this cut to be cooked 
is oven roasted whole. The complex bone structure and significant internal 
fat deposits make other uses difficult.<p></p>

<p>
This is the boneless version of the Boston Butt, actually cut a bit 
different from the regular version. This cut is often rolled and secured 
with netting to provide a uniform roasting thickness.</p>
