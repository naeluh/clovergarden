<h1>Pork Belly</h1>

[Fresh Bacon, Uncured Bacon]
<p>
Most pork bellies end up cured and smoked into bacon, but fresh pork 
belly is widely used in Asian recipes. It is also used in Latin 
American recipes and in Eastern and Central European cooking. Pork 
belly is now returning to popularity in North America - see 
<a href="ap_bellyz.html#health"><b>Health &amp; Nutrition</b></a>.</p>

<p>The photo specimen is a half belly with skin, including the part 
that was over the spare ribs. A cross section slice is to the left. 
The photo specimen was 14 inches long, 10.5 inches wide, 2-1/4 inches 
thick at the thickest point and weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces. A whole 
belly would be 28 inches long and weigh about 13 pounds.
</p>
<p>Pork bellies may also be sold with the spare ribs still attached, 
and Asian markets here in Los Angeles have them both ways</p>

<p>Pork belly futures were once a huge item on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, but that market has been closed for some time, to the distress 
of comedians. Demand is now more steady, so frozen pork bellies need no 
longer be stored for long periods. They are now commonly sold immediately 
and often fresh. This has resulted in some pricing uncertainty and 
volatility in bacon prices, but not enough to justify a commodities 
market.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh pork belly can be found, usually sliced, 
in markets serving East and Southeast Asian communities, particularly 
in Philippine markets. These should generally be bought "skin on" because 
the skin is an important part of most recipes. Pork belly can also be 
found in markets serving Mexican communities.

<p>Philippine markets here in Southern California have a wide selection, 
selling belly ribs on, ribs removed, slices with or without ribs, and cubes 
(without ribs). The skin is always included.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Asian cooking the belly is generally cut 
into strips about 3/8 thick, 3/8 to 3/4 inches wide and in length the 
thickness of the belly, but may also be cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Cubes 
an inch on a side and larger are also used.

<p>Pork belly recipes are are often quite rich due to the fat layers. I 
have also used the boneless end of a side of spare ribs which is leaner, 
but you mustn't go too lean or the recipe simply won't work right.</p>

<p>European recipes often call for a large square of the belly, score 
the skin side, rub with herbs and spices, and roast in a moderate oven 
until most of the fat has rendered out and the skin is crisp. It still 
isn't really low calorie though.

<h2 id="health">Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>

<p>Use of extremely flavorful Pork Belly and Lard, is increasing in 
North America, a move being lead by top chefs. The reasons for this 
are three:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been 
exposed as fraudulent from the get-go. Harvard scientists were paid by 
the Sugar Industry to produce studies with false or misleading results. 
The diet is now being studied as a possible significant contributor to 
chronic diseases.<p></p></li>

<li>Animal fats are not the cause of clogged arteries. The American 
Heart Association's vendetta against animal fats has been shown to be 
based on deliberately defective studies and influenced by the Seed 
Oil industry, a major source of AHA funding. The animal fats we 
evolved with are far less dangerous than the Trans Fats they urged us 
to use instead, as well as the unnatural polyunsaturated fats they 
still urge us to use. Actual studies have shown sufficient saturated 
fat will protect the heart from the ravages of Canola Oil, at least 
for rats. For details, see <a href="ap_lardz.html">
<b>Lard</b></a>.<p></p></li>

<li>Flavor, plain and simple. The reason, despite shrill warnings from 
the AHA, a great many Americans flat out refused to give up Bacon 
(salt cured and smoked Pork Belly).</li>

</ul>
