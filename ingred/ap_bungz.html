[Hog Bung]
<p>
This is the rectum and large intestine of the pig. In the West it is 
  commonly used as a large sausage casing. In East and Southeast Asia it is 
  a popular street food. They are also prepared similarly in Mexico.</p>

<p>If sold for cooking it's called "Pork Bung", if sold for making sausages 
  it's called "Hog Bung".  The photo specimens were 23 inches long, 2 inches 
  diameter at the big end and weighed 6-1/4 ounces.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3>: &nbsp; If you intend to cook these, they're most easily 
found in markets serving an East or Southeast Asian community. Look for 
them in the frozen food cases. If buying for sausage making you can get 
them from the usual purveyors of sausage casings.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  If you've just butchered your own pig, you've got 
a good deal of scrubbing to do, and generally need to turn the bung 
inside out to clean the inside. If you've bought a package in a North 
American market, they're cleaned up and ready to go.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Generally these are simmered for an hour, 
then sliced diagonally about 1 inch wide. They may be deep fried, often 
wrapped around a scallion, or stir fried. If fried crisp they are usually 
served with a dip. In Mexico also they are served with beans and 
tortillas if still chewy, on there own (perhaps with hot sauce) if 
crisp.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; If you've bought a 1 pound package you should 
have about 8 ounces or so after simmering (50%).<p></p>
