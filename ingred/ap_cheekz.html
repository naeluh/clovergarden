<p>
This is kind of a "secret cut", unknown to the general public and still 
economical. It is very lean and tough, but with a <u>lot</u> of 
connective tissue in it, making it moist, tender and very flavorful 
with long cooking. Ideal for braises and stews. The photo specimens 
(showing both sides) were 3-3/4 ounces each, measuring 3-3/4 inches 
long, 3-1/2 wide and 1 inch thick at the thickest part.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is a rarely seen cut here in Southern 
California, but I have found it at 168 Market, a large Asian market 
Alhambra, packed in the usual shrink wrapped foam trays.  Others 
have obtained these from specialty butcher shops. I paid 2014 US 
$2.89 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Rinse, cut to the size you want (1-1/2 inches is 
usually good). Yield approaches 100%.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These take about 1-3/4 to 2 hours of slow 
simmering to be nice and tender. They may be stir fried lightly brown 
before adding liquid and simmering.<p></p>
