<h1>Pork Chops</h1>
<br><img src="img/ap_chop23g.jpg" alt="Pork Chops" class=mrg>
<p>
Pork Chops are simply slices across the loin. They fall into roughly three 
categories as shown in the photo. To the left is a chop near the shoulder 
end (#1410B), to the right a chop near the sirloin end (also #1410B), and 
in the center is the classic porkchop shaped center chop (#1412). Pork chops 
typically weigh between 6 and 8 ounces.</p>
<p>There are variations on the #1412L &nbsp;  #1412A (Chine bone off), #1412B 
(boneless) and #1412E (boneless, single muscle and trimmed of nearly all 
fat). You aren't likely to see any of these variations in your local market - 
they're ordered by the restaurant trade. </p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; If you want to serve pork chops, buy them already 
cut from the loin. The bones are too wide for simply cutting between them.
Buy the cuts that are most suitable for your use.<p></p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Blade End Chops:</h3> &nbsp; (Left) &nbsp; These have more flavor 
  than the center cut chops but vary a lot in shape and bone configuration.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Center Cut Chops:</h3> &nbsp; (Center) &nbsp; These are in the 
  most demand and often sell at a higher price than the others. This is 
  the form you want for stuffed pork chops.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Sirloin End Chops:</h3> &nbsp; (Right) &nbsp; These have no rib 
  bone at all, but will have various other bone configurations. The one 
  at the right in the photo was cut from a loin that had the tenderloin 
  removed, which is why it has that gap to the right of the T bone. 
  Those sold in markets generally include the tenderloin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;Pork chops are the primary pork cut for pan 
frying.<p></p>
<p>Some cookbooks, especially ones on Asian cuisine recommend removing 
the bones and fat from pork chops and using the meat for stir frying. 
Their reasoning is that loin meat is tender, and pork chops are an easily 
available form. Personally I don't give loin that much preference, other 
cuts have more flavor and just aren't tougher enough to worry about.
