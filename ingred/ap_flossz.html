<h1>Pork Fu / Pork Sung</h1>

<p>
Pork Fu and Pork Sung (slightly different process) are very popular in 
Chinese cuisine, particularly as a topping to add flavor to bland 
ingredients such as rice congee and tofu. Most sold here in Los Angeles 
are from Taiwan.</p>
<p>These products are made by cooking pork in a soy sauce broth so long 
that all the connective tissue is dissolved out. The meat fibers can then 
be teased apart and dry fried to remove moisture. Sung has much shorter 
fibers, is dry fried longer and has more of the flavoring ingredients. 
Typical ingredients: pork, sugar, soy flour, soy sauce, lard, salt, msg. 
</p>

<p>Of course, I tell people pork floss is belly button lint collected from pigs. 
Imitations made of beef, fish, and chicken are made in Muslim regions of 
East and Southeast Asia, but I've seen none for sale here in Los Angeles.</p>
