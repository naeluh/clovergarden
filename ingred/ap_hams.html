<p>
Preserving pork with salt and smoke date from ancient times. This was 
necessary because the pigs had to be slaughtered every autumn because it 
would be impossible to feed them through the winter. Today this is no 
longer necessary, but these techniques continue to be used, now almost 
entirely for flavor and texture.
</p>
<p>The largest single chunks of a pig are the hams, the hind legs of the 
pig (and to a lesser extent the front legs). These have long had special 
treatment. They are much more difficult to preserve than smaller parts, 
and more rewarding. The photo is of a slice from a Virginia type Picnic 
Ham bought from an Asian market in Los Angeles.</p>

<h2>Ham - Wet Cure, "City Ham"</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gmm_hamcty1.html">
<img src="img/ap_ham03h.jpg" alt="Whole Roasted Ham" class=mrg></a>
<p>
The modern Wet Cure process is a fairly recent development, emerging from the 
realm of county fair contests along the American east coast in the mid to 
late 1800s. It proved to be far more suitable than the dry cure for large 
scale industrial production.</p>
<p>With improved transportation and commercial refrigeration coming on line 
in the late 1800s the relatively short shelf life of the commercial product 
became increasingly less of a problem and allowed reduction of the amount of 
salt used in the process. Processing time was greatly shortened by machinery 
which injected cure solution into the hams or tumbled them continuously in 
vats to massage the cure into the meat.</p>
For the home and restaurant consumer, these hams were much less expensive 
and far more convenient than the dry cured - and, the wet cure ham, with 
much less salt, can serve as a main dish feature. The dry cured is used 
mostly for appetizers, recipe ingredients and sandwich slices.

<h2>Ham - Dry Cure "Country Ham"</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gmm_hamctry1.html">
<img src="img/ap_hamctry02h.jpg" alt="Dry Curing Hams" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Virginia ham, Springfield ham, Jamon Iberico, Jamon Serrano, 
Prosciutto, Jinhua ham, and many more]
</p><p>
<p>The dry cure process has changed little since the time of the Roman 
Empire. The main improvements have been in the purity of the salt available 
and the discovery that potassium nitrate added to the salt cure greatly 
improved color, flavor and safety. The cure is much more controllable now.</p>
<p>Today almost all dry cured meat products include sodium or potassium 
nitrate and wet cure meat products include sodium or potassium nitrite 
(faster acting for the much shorter cure time) to improve safety and 
appearance. For details see our <a href="sa_saltptz.html">Curing Salts</a> 
page.</p>
<p>Many dry cured ham products are still produced in America, Europe and 
China, For details of buying, preparation and a list of types, see our  
<a href="../recipes/gmm_hamctry1.html"><b>Cooking Dry Cure Hams</b></a>

<h2>Spanish Hams</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hamiber1h.jpg" alt="Spanish Ham and Slices" class=mrg>
[Jamon Serrano | Jamon Iberico]
<p>
Spain produces the most prestigious hams in the world. While they are now 
legally imported into the United States, the astronomical price limits 
enjoyment of them mainly to the detested 1%. They are much less expensive 
in Europe, but with transportation, duties and handling it's even far 
worse than foreign car parts here.

<p>These hams are to be sliced very thin and eaten raw. To this purpose 
special cutting fixtures and special knives are used. The bones left when 
the meat has been enjoyed, are also considered highly desirable for 
Spanish soups and stews, and are even sold separately by merchants that 
sell ham slices.</p>
<p>Jamon Serrano is a dry cure ham made from the legs of white Spanish 
pigs fed on special diets (how special dictates the final price). A whole 
16 pound ham is likely to set you back around US $850.</p>
<p>Jamon Iberico is a dry cured ham made from the legs of black Iberian 
pigs. The most expensive are from pigs allowed to forage acorns in the 
cork oak forests of Spain. A whole 16 pound ham of this sort will set you 
back about US $1600. Those from pigs with less acorn in their diet can be 
a bit less.</p>
<p>"Serrano Style" hams are now made in North America. Not quite the same 
as the Spanish, but costing between US $100 and $170, depending on aging 
and smoking. No attempt is made to produce an "Iberico Style" because we 
don't have cork oak forests here - we get our wine corks from Spain and 
Portugal.

<h2>Bayonne Hams</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hambay01h.jpg" alt="Bayonne Hams" class=mrg>
[Jambon de Bayonne]
<p>
This is the famous ham of far southwestern corner of France, particularly 
Le Pays Basque, but also parts of Gascony. It is salt cured using two 
different kinds of salt at different tims, <i>Salies-de-B&eacute;arn</i> 
and <i>sel de Bayonne</i>, and it is not smoked. I don't know if it's 
currently legal to import it, but it is said some good imitations are 
made by the Basque communities of Northern California. They even import 
the proper salts. The best substitutes are Westphalian ham or a good 
quality Italian Prosciutto.</p>
<p>The photo shows Bayonne hams hanging in a drying room. The modern 
drying cycle imitates the natural temperature and humidity changes of 
the Pays Basque and Gascony from late October to July.

<h2>Westphalian Ham</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hamwph02d.jpg" alt="Westphalian Slice" class=mrg>
[West&auml;lischer Schinken]
<p>
This famous dry cure ham is made from pigs fed on acorns in the forests of 
Westphalia, Germany. Smoked over beechwood and juniper, it has very deep 
ham flavor and is intended to be sliced very thin. It's a bit costly. The 
photo specimen, not from a gourmet outlet but from a low cost multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles, sold at US $13.99 / pound. The slice was 6-1/4 inches 
long and 2-1/2 inches high. While this ham was flattened, many Westphalian 
hams are round.</p>
<p>Similar products from Germany are <i>Ammerl&auml;der Schinken</i>, cured with 
sea salt, brown sugar and spices, and smoked over beechwood, and 
<i>Schwarzw&auml;lder Schinken</i>, <b>Black Forest Ham</b>, smoked over 
sawdust and fir brush. <u>Be Warned</u>: most hams sold in North America by 
the name "Black Forest Ham" are wet cure products with little resemblence to 
the real thing.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chinese Dry Cure Hams</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hamchina01h.jpg" alt="Chinese Hams Curing" class=mrg>
<p>[Jinhua ham and similar]
</p><p>
These hams have been made in China since at least back to the year 900, 
and are considered very fine. They have won prizes internationally, but  
they are still illegal to import into the United States. For this reason 
Asian markets here in California sell 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick slices of 
domestic Virginia type hams - usually made from the front leg to keep the 
slice size and cost reasonable.</p>
<p>The Chinese use this ham in a wide variety of stews, soups and soup 
stocks. I buy them for use in American recipes also, and admit to being 
guilty of slicing them thin and eating them raw - don't know what the 
USDA would have to say about that. In any case, the Asian markets are 
a convenient source for an otherwise difficult ingredient.

<h2>Chinese Cured Smoked Ham</h2>
<br><a href="ap_chhamz.html">
<img src="img/ap_hamcss01h.jpg" alt="Slab of Chinese Ham" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Much different from our hams, this one is quite dry, sweet and seasoned 
with soy sauce and smoke. It is meant to be an ingredient, cut into small 
pieces, rather than being eaten as a feature item.</p>

<p>The photo specimen, purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, was 
made by Hsin Tung Yang Foods Company of San Francisco, California, so we 
can be pretty sure it's unleaded and contains no melamine.

<h2>Prosciutto</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_prosci01d.jpg" alt="Slice of Prosciutto" class=mrg> 
[Parma Ham]
<p>
This product of Italy (the best are said to be from Parma) is a boneless, 
uncooked, dry cured ham, unsmoked (except a few in the Alpine region of 
Italy). It has a flattened shape because for part of the cure cycle it is 
held under weights. It is generally deboned for easy slicing. Delis will 
occasionally sell ends a pieces at a reduced price.</p> 
<p>In Italy there is a cooked (cotto) form but elsewhere the raw (crudo) form 
is expected. It is most commonly eaten raw, and, being tough and salty, 
it is usually sliced very thin. If using it as a flavoring element in stews 
or other cooked recipes, buy it unsliced so you can cut it into thicker 
pieces. The fat is an important part of the product and sometimes 
specifically called for in recipes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Prosciuttini</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_protini02h.jpg" alt="Slice of Prosciuttini" class=mrg> 
[Pepper Ham]
<p>
A product of Italy, this is ham pieces molded into a cylinder or rectangle and 
coated with pepper. It is usually not smoked. Compared to Prosciutto, it is 
more tender, moister and less salty, thus more in need of careful 
refrigeration. It is used mainly for sandwich slices. The photo specimen 
was 4 inches in diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Capicolla</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_capic02h.jpg" alt="Slice of Capiocolla" class=mrg>
[Capocollo, Coppa]
<p>
This Italian product is made from meat of the neck and shoulder, lightly 
seasoned and cured in the manner of ham. It is stuffed into a natural casing, 
often coated with paprika, sometimes lightly smoked, and aged for up to 6 
months. It is not very salty, and is used mainly for sandwich slices. If 
coated with paprika, the flavor permeates the whole product but is not 
particularly strong. The photo specimen was 4-1/8 inch diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Other Hams</h2>

<ul>
  <li><h3>Culitello</h3> &nbsp; (Italian) &nbsp; made from meat high in 
    the butt end of the ham. Very lean and aged with spices and dry wine. 
    Deep red color and sweet flavor.</li>
  <li><h3>Gammon:</h3> &nbsp; (primarily UK usage) &nbsp; the whole side 
    of the pig is cured at once (usually a bacon cure) and the leg cut 
    off after. Often sold as gammon steaks or slices. Generally boiled 
    and sometimes glazed by a final baking.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Canned Hams</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gmm_hamcty1.html">
<img src="img/ap_hamcan01h.jpg" alt="Ham in a Can" class=mrg></a>
[Jinhua ham and similar]
<p>
Canned hams vary tremendously in quality. I have read that the brand in 
the photo is quite good, but many are made of random chunks and pieces 
glued together, sort of like SPAM without the spicing. Gelatin is added 
to fill the can so the ham won't be rattling around in there. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; trademark owner</small>.</p>
<p>Canned hams come two ways: "perishable", which need to be kept under 
refrigeration, and "eternal" which are fully cooked, pasteurized, shelf 
stable  and can be eaten without cooking. A variation of canned hams is 
the "Hostess Ham". This one, generally chunks glued together, is packed 
in a cylindrical can for easy and uniform slicing.</p>
<p>For details on handling and cooking canned hams, see our page 
<a href="../recipes/gmm_hamcty1.html"><b>Cooking Wet Cure Hams</b></a> 
(canned hams are always wet cure).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Ham and Water Product</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hamwat01h.jpg" alt="Slice of Ham Product" class=mrg>
<p>
These products are generally made from chunks and pieces of ham molded together 
into a loaf. The photo specimen has a solid lump in the middle and the rest 
is made up of small pieces and chopped ham, possibly "mechanically deboned". 
These products slice well and are sold mainly for use in sandwiches. They are 
always fully cooked and "ready to eat". This one was composed of 35% ground 
ham shank, ham, water.
<br class=cll></p> 

<h2>SPAM</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ap_SPAM01h.jpg" alt="SPAM Block &amp; Slice" class=mrg>
<p>
SPAM is a construct from "Spiced Ham", and was first produced by Hormel 
Food Corporation in 1937. It is a canned pre-cooked meat product which 
has ham in it, but not as the major ingredient which is pork. It's 
popularity has been greatly enhanced worldwide by war and disaster. 
After WWII, American soldiers swore they'd never touch SPAM again so long 
as they lived, but soon succumbed to nostalgia. In England it is still 
remembered fondly as a major factor in the country not starving during 
the war. In Asia, also introduced by war and disaster, it is so favorably 
viewed it is made up in gift sets to be presented to the hostess when 
invited to dinner. A number of Asian dishes in the Philippines, China 
and Japan now incorporate it as a feature ingredient.

<p>US SPAM consumption averages 3.8 cans per second. That's SPAM, not 
Spam or spam, which are names for unwelcome emails. Ingredients: Pork with 
ham, salt, water modified potato starch, sugar, sodium nitrite. There are 
now a number of variations, the most common of which is Spam Lite, which 
includes mechanically separated chicken as well as the traditional pork 
and ham.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Deviled Ham Spread</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ap_hamdev02d.jpg" alt="Deviled Ham Can and Bowl" class=mrg>
This product was developed by the William Underwood company in 1868 and is 
now the property of Pillsbury Company. It is generally used as a spread on 
crackers and in sandwiches. Texture is much like canned tuna (the kind 
without big solid parts - do they still make any with solid parts?). The 
flavor is a little like it too, but it has noticeable chili heat (the 
"deviled" part). The devil now on the can is a much friendlier looking guy 
than on the original cans. Ingredients: ham (cured with water, salt), brown 
sugar, sodium nitrite, seasoning (mustard 
flour, spices, turmeric).
