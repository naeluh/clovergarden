<h1>Pork Hocks</h1>
<br><img src="img/ap_hocks01g.jpg" alt="Fresh Pork Hock Slices" class=mrg>
[#417 (shoulder) #417A (ham); Pig Knuckle (GB); Schweinhaxen, Eisbein 
(German)]
<p>
This is simply the lower shank of the leg between the ham and the foot 
(aft leg) or the shoulder and the foot (fore leg). It has much more meat and 
much more fat than the foot, but the meat is tougher and with a lot more 
connective tissue in it compared to the ham or shoulder.</p>

<p>In Europe the hock is commonly pickled in brine rather than left fresh. 
In North America you'll generally have to do your own brining. In times 
past beer bars in North America had big jars of vinegar pickled pork hocks 
which were sold by the piece, but this practice was rapidly fading by the 
1980s.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh hocks are now rare in chain supermarkets but 
can easily be found in markets serving Asian or Mexican communities. Generally 
they will be sliced about 1 inch thick as in the photo, but they can also 
be had as part of a <a href="ap_feetz.html"><b>Long Foot</b></a>. For 
some European recipes you will need unsliced hocks - ask the meat man, 
he can probably supply them uncut.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Wash them to remove any saw debris. If your 
recipe calls for them in chunks, the bones split very easily lengthwise by 
driving a sharp Chinese cleaver knife through with a soft faced mallet. 
Crosswise they are too hard for many knives, and cutting them this way will 
produce bone chips, so have your meat man bandsaw them.<p></p>

<h3>Salt Cure:</h3> &nbsp; Central European recipes often require cured 
but unsmoked hocks. You can do this by soaking (refrigerated) in a brine 
made from 1/2 cup kosher salt (Morton) to each liter (it's European) of 
water for 2 to 5 days. Use 1/2 Tablespoon per liter "Pink Salt" 
(nitrite curing salt) for better color.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; You'll need to simmer these for about 1-1/2 hours, 
15 minutes longer if you are cooking whole hocks rather than slices.

<h2 class=h1 id="ham">Ham Hocks</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_hockham05g.jpg" alt="Smoked Hocks" class=mrg>
[#561]
<p>
<b>Ham Hocks</b> are simply pork hocks that have been salt cured and 
smoked fairly heavily. They are most often used as an ingredient in soups 
and stews, generally with strongly flavored greens, particularly collard 
greens, beans, blackeye peas, and the like.</p>

<p>Ham hocks vary greatly in size depending on how they are cut and 
whether they are from a front leg or hind leg. The hocks shown in the 
photo are typical but at the very large end of the size range. The one to 
the right is 3 inches high, 5 inches wide and 6 inches long, weighing 1 
pound 14-1/2 ounces. They are comonly between 9 ounces and 1 pound.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Because of their prominent place in American 
southern cuisine and "Soul Food" cooking, smoked hocks are still fairly 
available in supermarkets, particularly in communities with a sizeable 
black population.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are tougher than fresh hocks. They will be 
edible but still chewy in about 1-1/2 hours, but are often cooked until 
the meat falls from the bones, which will take at least 3-1/2 hours. At 
3 hours they are satisfactorily edible as a cold snack, not too chewy.
