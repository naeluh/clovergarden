This is cut is from the jowl, with most of the fat removed - but not all 
the fat. The jowl is below the cheek, which is right behind the jaw and 
contains a big lump of very tough meat. The jowl contains a thin layer 
of much more tender meat, and this cut is trimmed to the thickness of 
that meat layer at its thickest.

<p>This is quite different from the more familiar cured products - the 
Hog Jowl Bacon of North America and the Guanciale of Italy. Both of 
those use the full thickness of the jowl, which is mostly fat. For those  
products see our <a href="ap_pigp.html"><b>Pork Products</b></a> page.
</p>

<p>The photo specimens were about half an inch thick, the largest 
was 6-3/4 x 5-1/2 inches and wighed 9-7/8 ounces. The photo shows both 
sides. The meat layer is not even so the constant thickness cut is 
nearly ll meat on one edge, and tapers to nearly all fat on the opposite 
edge.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very uncommon cut here in Southern 
California. I purchased it from an Asian market in Alhambra, a market 
that carries a lot of cuts of meat unfamiliar to Americans.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Use any method commonly used for fatty pig 
parts. This cut would probably be good for grinding into sausage, which 
requires a lot of fat.  I lightly fried 1 pound 10 ounces of slabs of 
this meat. After frying, I found it was very easy to slice away the 
fat down to a very thin layer. This left 1 pound 2-1/2 ounces, for a 
yield of 71%.<p></p>

<p>The fat, of course, can be very easily rendered into useful lard. 
Do not fear the lard, it is far less dangerous than the deadly trans 
fats the AHA urged you to use instead, and you survived those (we hope). 
It tastes a lot better than trans fats too - for details see  our 
<a href="ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</p>
