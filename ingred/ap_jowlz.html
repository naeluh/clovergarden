<p>
While an important ingredient in the American Southeast, folks in 
much of North America are not particularly familiar with Hog Jowels. 
Basically, it's the pig's cheeks. While the Italian Guanciale is 
salt cured with herbs, Hog Jowl in the US is generally salt cured and 
smoked like bacon.</p>
 
<p>In American Southern cuisine, Hog Jowl is used much like bacon. 
it can be sliced and fried like bacon, and is often used as a 
flavoring ingredient with beans and greens. The larger of the 
photo specimens was 6-3/4 inches long, 2 inches thick and 2-1/2 inches 
at its widest.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Los Angeles, I find it most often at 
the Altadena location of Super King Markets. This store's customers 
include a fairly high black population (20% to 25%), some of whom would 
know what to do with this ingredient. It is rather difficult to find 
anywhere else. Of course, in the US Southeast it is much more common.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Stored tightly sealed in the refrigerator 
it should last for a couple of weeks. If it gets a few spots of mold on 
it, just scrape the mold off before slicing.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, just cut it into the desired pieces. 
Properly, it will include the skin. If you are just going to fry it, 
cut the skin off (and reserve for another use) as it will be quite 
tough. If it will be simmered for some time, leave the skin on.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Use as per recipe - or as a substitute for 
ham hocks or bacon. Note that jowls have a lot more fat than regular 
bacon, and that fat renders rather easily, so you may need to pour 
some off.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Smoked Bacon, Smoked ham hocks<p></p>
