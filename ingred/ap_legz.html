[Fresh Ham, #401 Whole Leg]
<p>
The back leg of a pig, this cut is the lower part of the ham section but 
is not the whole section. There'a a lot of meat between this cut and the 
aft end of the loin but it has relatively complex bones so is usually 
boned and sold as "boneless leg".</p>

<p>The largest use for this cut is production of cured hams. Fresh hams 
are rare in major supermarkets due to size, but can be found in various 
ethnic markets. The photo specimen was obtained from a market 
serving communities from the Black Sea area, Mexico and Central America.
</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 11-1/2 inches across the face, 7 inches high,
10-1/2 inches long and weighed 13-1/2 pounds. Of this 7-1/2 pounds were 
clear recoverable meat. It was cut across to "short shank" length but the 
end piece was left attached by skin on one side. The photo shows the full 
length.  This is a very big cut, but fortunately my local market also 
sells 1-1/2 inch thick slabs cut from the leg.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; How you use one of these is between you 
and your recipe, but I surgically dismantled the photo specimen for analysis 
(and because that's what I usually do with these things), a process that 
takes about 2-1/2 hours. Complete breakdown:<p></p>
