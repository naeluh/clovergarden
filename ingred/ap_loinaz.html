<h1>Pork Loin (Aft Half)</h1>
<br><img src="img/ap_loin05i.jpg" alt="Pork Loin (aft half)" class=mrg>
<p>
This cut is from the top of the pig down to the centerline (you can 
see the spine cut in half lengthwise in the photo) running from just 
forward of the ham to the midpoint of the pig.</p>
<p>While you won't often find such a cut at your local chain supermarket, 
ethnic markets do supply it. The photo speciment was obtained from a market 
that serves communities primarily from southern Russia, Georgia, Armenia, 
Mexico and Central America. They were offering the forward half, aft half, 
or the entire loin as you might chose at US $0.99/#.</p>

<p>The photo specimen was 18 inches long, 9 inches wide, 4-1/2 inches thick 
and weighed almost 12-1/2 pounds. Of this 7-3/4 pounds was clear meat free of 
fat, bones and membranes (62%) The rest 2-3/4 pounds of bones and 2 pounds of 
misc bits of meat, fat and membranes, made a most excelent soup stock.</p>

<p>This cut includes a lot of connective tissue so if you just slice it and 
pan fry it you will find it flavorful but rather chewey. It's best used for 
slow roasted or wet cooked methods and would make a flavorful soup.

<h3>Tenderloin:</h3> 
&nbsp; This is a long narrow muscle shown here. It is the only real 
muscle on the inside side of the ribs. See <a href="ap_lointz.html">

<h3>Sirloin End:</h3> &nbsp; Several cuts can be made crosswise from 
the aft (sirloin) end of the loin. They will include part of the pelvic 
bone and some of the backbone leading to the tail.

<h3>Sirloin End Chops:</h3> &nbsp; You can see that there are only two 
to three small ribs from this point on back and they're rather loose, 
so chops sliced from this cut will be meaty but not have tails. If what 
you want is bone-on chops you want the butcher to saw them, the spine 
segments are much too wide for a fryable chop. If you want boneless 
chops, just remove the meat and slice it yourself. &nbsp;
