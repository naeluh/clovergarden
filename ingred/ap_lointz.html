This muscle structure is found on the inside of the ribcage at the aft 
end of the loin. Getting relatively little excercise and pretty much 
devoid of fat or connective tissue it's the most tender meat on the pig.
<p>It's small size and lack of structural integrity limit its usefulness, 
but it's often smoked whole and sold for slicing and snacking. The photo 
specimen was 14 inches long, 2-3/4 inches wide, 1-3/8 inches thick and 
weighed just over 1 pound with a yield nearly 100%.</p>

<p>With limited use on its own, this cut is most often left in the 
ribcage and becomes part of Loin End Pork Chops, on the opposite side 
of the "T" bone from the rest of the meat.</p>

<p>I have a cookbook with Chinese recipes calling for tenderloin to be 
sliced crosswise very thin and then the slices cut into narrow strips 
before frying. This is sturcturally imposible with the American 
tenderloins I've dealt with, they'd just crumble to tiny fragments. 
Maybe Chinese pigs have tougher tenderloins.</p>
