<h1>Pickled Pig Parts</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Pickling in salt and vinegar has been a food preservation technique since 
pre-literate times. Today preservation is not so much of an issue, but the 
flavors are much enjoyed (though not by everyone). Pickled pork was a 
mainstay for Portuguese sailors who introduced it and chili peppers to India 
through their colony of Goa. While chilis conquered India in short order, 
vinegar and vinegared pig stayed pretty much in Goa. Here we present some of 
the pig parts commonly pickled with vinegar. Recipes for most of them will 
be found in our recipe pages.</p>

<h2>Pickled Pig Skins</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gam_pigskpkl1.html">
<img src="img/ap_skinpkle06f.jpg" alt="Strips of Pickled Skin" class=mrg></a>
These can be very good - or very bad. Good ones are thick and firm like 
those in the photo, pickled in a moderate vinegar broth. If they are soft 
and mushy they are terrible, and some are too strong on the vinegar. Some 
produced here in Los Angeles by ethnic Mexican producers can be excellent, 
but even they can screw up a batch now and then. Those in the photo were 
by Faraon, a reliable ethnic distributor here in Los Angeles.
<p>Rolls of pig skin are easily available in any market that serves a 
significant Mexican community, but pickling them is tricky, and you need 
some potassium nitrate (saltpeter). Of course we have a successful recipe 
for <a href="../recipes/gam_pigskpkl1.html"><b>Pickled Pig Skins</b></a>.

<h2>Pickled Pig Feet</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gam_pigftpkl2.html">
<img src="img/ap_pigftpkl2f.jpg" alt="Pickled Pig Feet" class=mrg></a>
Feet are the best known pickled pig part, enjoyed throughout the world (except, 
of course, in Israel and the Muslim regions). In times past, any reputable 
American meat market had a huge jar of pickled pig feet on display, and that's 
how they're best (or, make your own). Put up in jars, those from 
major brands can be <u>really</u> <u>awful</u>, mushy, acrid and greasy, but 
some Mexican ethnic brands are pretty decent. In my vegetarian days, I'd 
occasionally weaken and succumb to the lure of a jar of pickled pig feet. 
The photo specimens were pickled using our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/gam_pigftpkl2.html"><b>Pickled Pig Feet #2</b></a>.

<h2>Pickled Pig Snouts</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gam_pigsnout1.html">
<img src="img/ap_snout2f.jpg" alt="Pig Snout on Plate" class=mrg></a>
This is one pickled pig part I haven't found commercially in Los Angeles, 
but the Asian markets here are well stocked with fresh pig snouts so you 
can make your own. In some pig producing regions they are a minor commercial 
item, carefully packed in jars with their noses pressed to the glass. The 
photo specimen is one I pickled myself. They're trickier to get right than 
pig feet, but not nearly as tricky as pig skins. They are much less messy 
to eat than Pig Feet. Here's our recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/gam_pigsnout1.html"><b>Pickled Pig Snouts</b></a>.

<h2>Pickled Pig Ear Strips</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gam_pigerpkl1.html">
<img src="img/ap_pigerpkl1d.jpg" alt="Pig Ear Strips" class=mrg></a>
Pig ears have a unique texture - a thin crunchy cartilage core with thick 
skin layers on both sides. The flavor is also unique. I have purchased 
commercially packed jars here in Los Angeles, but they were just too awful 
to eat. I have developed my own recipe which produces a very enjoyable 
product. Here it is: 
<a href="../recipes/gam_pigerpkl1.html"><b>Pickled Pig Ear Strips</b></a>.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Pickled Pork Hocks</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/gam_pighkpkl1.html">
<img src="img/ap_pighkpkl1d.jpg" alt="Pickled Pork Hocks" class=mrg></a>
Time was when every self respecting beer bar had a big jar of pickled eggs 
and one of pickled pork hocks on display. Patrons could order by the piece, 
but I haven't seen this in recent times. Hocks are easier to eat than feet 
and have a considerably different flavor because they are much meatier. 
Recipe coming soon.
