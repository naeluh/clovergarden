<p>
Pigs are temperate climate forest animals native to Europe and Asia.
They are often associated with mud because, since they can't sweat, they 
may wallow in mud to cool down. They prefer clean mud because they are 
clean animals by nature. They are also smart, smarter than dogs, but 
find scant sympathy from animal lovers because they aren't so cute and 
cuddly.</p>
<p>The ancestral form, the wild boar (photo), was depleted by hunting 
in the 16th through 19th centuries but has recovered most of it's former 
range and is now found from England to Japan and from Sweden to Indonesia.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General and History</h2>

<p>Pigs were one of the first animals to be domesticated, probably 
because they found hanging around with people provided a good food 
supply. Scientists now believe pigs were domesticated about 7000 years 
ago and independently in China and the Near East.</p>

<p>Near Eastern domesticated pigs were taken to Europe and from them the 
Europeans learned to domesticate their own wild boars. European pigs 
were in turn exported to the Near East and the Near Eastern genotype is 
now extinct in Europe.<p>

<p>Domestic pigs can get very large, even over 1000 pounds (domestic pig 
named Fred, released on a hunting preserve and shot in April 2007), but 
they are generally sent to market at less than a year old and about 230 
pounds.</p>

<h3>Wild Boar</h3> is also in considerable demand so there are boar farms 
all over Europe to fill the demand. Some of their ancestral territory, 
recently reclaimed, has been settled by escapees from boar farms.<p></p>

<p>Domestic pigs can also go feral, becoming a real nuisance, destroying 
crops and causing substantial damage to delicate habitats. They are very 
difficult to control because they are very smart, hard to catch or hunt, 
and because of the inevitable outcry by unthinking single-issue animal 
advocates.</p>

<h2 id="who" class=lrg>Who Eats Pigs <small>&amp;</small> Who Doesn't</h2>

<p>Pigs are outstandingly tasty. So tasty, in fact, that God has reserved 
them for the Pagans (Pagans <i>senso lato</i> includes Christians) and 
forbids Jews and Muslims from eating them. They are not valuable as 
beasts of burden or for production of milk or wool, so you might as well 
eat them. Pork is the most eaten meat in much of the world, but not all 
the world. In some regions there are religious prohibitions, and in 
others, particularly India, they are economically nonviable because they 
compete directly with humans for scarce food resources. In such regions 
goats, which can survive on scrub and weeds, are the main meat. Here's 
a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Jews</h3> are forbidden by God from eating pig but have no 
  prohibitions on using non-food pig products such as leather. The Hebrew 
  texts call pigs "unclean" but provide no further explanation. A number 
  of reasons have been proposed which I explore on the page  
  <a href="ap_pigz.html"><b>Pig Prohibitions</b></a>.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Islam</h3> inherited the Jewish prohibition and expanded on it to 
  forbid any contact whatever with pigs or pig products on pain of frying 
  forever in the saut&eacute; pans of Hell - no virgins for you, buddy!
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Buddhists</h3> of non-vegetarian sects have no problem with pig. 
  Members of some vegetarian sects which depend on charity can eat pig if 
  it has been offered incidentally and was not prepared specifically for 
  them. It is said the Buddha himself died from being served tainted pork.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>India:</h3> Hindus have no prohibition on eating pig unless their 
  sect forbids all meat as part of a vegetarian discipline. Nonetheless, 
  pig is not much eaten in India, except in a few forested areas that 
  have a tradition of hunting wild pigs, or which have been under Chinese 
  (Northeast) or European influence (Goa). Most of India simply can't 
  afford pigs because they compete directly with humans for scarce food 
  resources.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>China</h3> and <h3>Southeast Asia</h3> are very big eaters of pig 
  except in the Muslim areas. In the northern Mongolian areas and Korea, 
  beef predominates but pig is not forbidden.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Christians</h3>, basically a powerful sub-cult of the Pagans, 
  have no dietary prohibitions and are quite fond of pig wherever it can 
  be raised economically, particularly in Europe and the Americas. A few 
  very small Christian sects do take Jewish law more seriously and 
  forbid pig, but who would want to belong to a sect like that?</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="cuts" class=lrg>Cuts of Pork</h2>

<p><a href="ap_pigc.html">
<img src="img/ap_pig17e.gif" alt="Marked Pig with Pork Cuts" class=mrg></a>
Pork cuts are much simpler than beef cuts, including only five "primal" 
cuts.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &curren; &nbsp; Shoulder, Boston Butt
<br> &nbsp; &curren; &nbsp; Shoulder, Picnic - including part of the front leg
<br> &nbsp; &curren; &nbsp; Leg or Ham
<br> &nbsp; &curren; &nbsp; Loin - from Butt to Ham
<br> &nbsp; &curren; &nbsp; Ribs - below the Loin, including belly
</p>
<p>Some presentations don't consider the rib/belly to be a primal cut, but I 
figure if pork bellies were good enough to have their own commodities 
exchange, they're good enough to be a primal cut (that exchange has been 
closed due to changes in bacon consumption and distribution).</p>
<p>Other parts of the pig not included in the primal cuts are used, and 
various of the innards. For more information on pork cuts (and innards) 
see our <a href="ap_pigc.html"><b>Cuts of Pork</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cured" class=lrg>Cured Pork</h2>

<p>Pork is superior to any other animal for preserving in many ways. In 
Europe, many methods were perfected, because the hogs could not be fed 
through the winter. It was hard enough to keep the people fed. So the 
hogs were slaughtered at the onset of winter and the meat preserved in 
a number of ways. While the need has largely faded away, these methods 
are still used because of the outstanding flavors and textures they 
provide.</p> 

<p>For <b>Hams</b>, see our <a href="ap_hams.html"><b>Hams</b></a> page, 
which has a link to comprehensive instructions on purchasing and cooking 
various types of hams. For other <b>Cured Pork</b> products, see our 
<a href="ap_pigp.html"><b>Pork Products</b></a> page.</p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health Considerations</h2>

<p>Pork has long been condemned in North America, particularly by the 
American Heart Association, as having a high content of "artery clogging 
saturated fat". Interestingly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, when 
Americans practically lived on lard and fatty pork, heart disease was not 
a major problem. This was pointed out by an elderly physician present at 
the kick-off for the AMA's "Heart Healthy Diet" (which featured using 
deadly trans fats instead). Nor does it seem to be much of a problem in 
other populations with high pork consumption. Lard, by the way, has less 
saturated fat than butter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, populations consuming a lot of trans fats (long 
promoted by the AHA as a "healthy alternative") and polyunsaturated oils, 
also heavily promoted by the AHA, do have a high incidence of both heart 
disease and cancer. I suspect there are serious flaws in current "medical 
knowledge", but I'm not a medical doctor so I don't dispense medical 
advice (nor do I have a vested interest in current "medical knowledge").
</p>

<p>What I do say is "Today's medical knowledge is tomorrow's quackery". 
In any case, the U.S. pork industry has worked hard to reduce the amount 
of fat in "the other white meat". even to the point flavor starts to 
suffer from lack of it. Fat can be removed almost entirely from many 
modern cuts of pork.</p>

<h3>Trichinosis</h3> is a parasitic worm disease associated with 
undercooked pork. While it is sometimes fatal or debilitating, most 
victims recover completely (but can still transmit the disease if you 
eat them undercooked). It has been pretty much eliminated from American 
commercial pork (and even more so in Germany where there is a tradition 
of eating pork raw), but is still occasionally found in "free range" 
pigs on small farms, and in other countries.<p></p>

<p>Trichinosis can be acquired from eating any animal that is not 
strictly vegetarian. Undercooked Bear is the most common source in the 
USA, but walrus, dog, raccoon, cat, human, horse and other omnivorous 
or carnivorous animals should also be cooked to an internal temperature 
of at least 149&deg;F/65&deg;C before serving. For more information 
see <a href="ap_pig.html#p02">Note P2</a>.</p>
