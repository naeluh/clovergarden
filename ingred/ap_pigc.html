I have seen another Fresh Cuts Chart that conflicts with this one, but 
this one seems to have more support. We also have a

Because of its large size (over 20 pounds) markets generally sell half

  This whole loin (#410) was 31 inches long, 7 inches wide, 4 inches thick 
  and   weighed 22 pounds 6 ounces. Shoulder end is to the right, ham end to 
  the left, including the tenderloin (bottom left). A center cut loin (#412)

  <img src="img/ap_loinbless08c.jpg" alt="Boneless Loin" class=mrg></a>
  The boneless loin is generally sold as a center cut (as in the photo) or 
  a half loin. This boneless loin was 23 inches long, 6-1/2 inches wide, 
  2-1/2 inches thick and weighed 8 pounds 14 ounces.

  This is the Boneles Loin rolled up and tied with string so it presents a 
  uniform thickness for oven roasting. Full length can be supplied to restaurants 
  but in the markets it's more likely to be a half loin as shown in the 
  photo.
  </td></tr>

  <td><a href="ap_loinaz.html">
  <img src="img/ap_bback08c.jpg" alt="Back Ribs" class=mrg></a>
  Why they're called "baby" is beyond me. This is the set of ribs from the 
  loin cut away from the spine. Basically it's the rib part of the loin after 
  the meaty boneless loin has been removed. These ribs don't have the 
  cartilagenous material found with spare ribs.
  </td></tr>

  <img src="img/ap_loint15c.jpg" alt="Tenderloin" class=mrg></a>
  This muscle structure is found on the inside of the ribcage at the aft 
  end of the loin. Getting relatively little excercise and pretty much 
  devoid of fat or connective tissue it's the most tender meat on the pig.
  The photo specimen, removed from the whole loin shown above, was 
  14 inches long, 3 inches wide at the widest point and 1-1/2 inches thick. 
  With the side muscle on it weighed 1 pound 6 ounces. With the side muscle 
  off (#415A) it weighed 1 pound 4-3/8 ounces.

  The photo shows pork chops from three positions on the loin. To the left 
  is from the shoulder end (#1410A rib chops), center cut (#1412) in the 
  middle and sirloin end (#1410B end chops) on the right. #1410B also 
  covers chops from the extreme shoulder end (not shown here but similar to 
  the sirloin end chops). The classic "pork chop" shaped center cut chops 
  usually sell at a higher price and sirloin end chops at the lowest price.
  Pork chops typically weigh between 6 and 8 ounces each.

  <td class=nw><b>Ribs</b></td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/ap_ctrystrib01c.jpg" alt="Country-Style Ribs" class=mrg>
  These are made from the rib section at the shoulder end of the whole loin. 
  The spine is removed but leaving the feather bones above and the ribs below. 
  The meaty part above the ribs is cut leaving half with the ribs and half 
  with the feather bones. The two sections sliced crosswise about 1 to 
  1-1/2 inchs thick and packed together. It is a meaty and economical cut 
  for the budget conscious.

  <img src="img/ap_belly05c.jpg" alt="Half Belly" class=mrg></a>
  Most pork bellies go straight to processors to cure, smoke and slice into 
  bacon, but fresh pork belly is widely used in Asian recipes. The photo 
  specimen is a half belly with skin, including the part that was over the 
  spare ribs. A cross section slice is to the left. The photo 
  specimen was 14 inches long, 10.5 inches  wide, 2-1/4 inches thick at the 
  thickest point and weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces. A whole belly would be 28 
  inches long and weigh about 13 pounds.

  <td><a href="ap_sribz.html">
  <img src="img/ap_ribstabarb01c.jpg" alt="Spare Ribs" class=mrg></a>
  Spare ribs underlie the front portion of the Pork Belly cut. The photo 
  specimen is cut lengthwise "Santa Barbara style". The upper section, if 
  sold separately, would be "Saint Louis Ribs". Be aware, if using English 
  recipes, that in the UK "Spare Ribs" is a cut from the top of the shoulder 
  and actually contains no ribs (see  
  <a href="ap_pigcc.html#brit">British Chart</a>).

  <img src="img/ap_saltpork02c.jpg" alt="Block of Salt Pork" class=mrg></a>
  Salt Pork is brined pork belly, the same as bacon but not smoked, 
  and with the skin on. It was formerly a very popular ingredient in American 
  cuisine, but fell out of favor due to the American Heart Association's 
  misguided vendetta against the natural fats we evolved with in favor of 
  deadly trans fats.

  The main use for pig heads in North America is the making of head cheese, 
  a large sausage like item. Unfortunately they are still not easy to find 
  even in the ethnic markets in Southern California. The photo specimen, a 
  half head, weighing around 5 pounds and yielded about 3 pounds of material 
  suitable for head cheese. Regretably the ear was removed, but those are 
  easily replaced from the Philippine markets.</td></tr>

  <td><a href="ap_cheekz.html">
  <img src="img/ap_cheek03c.jpg" alt="Cheek Meat" class=mrg></a>
  This is kind of a "secret cut", unknown to the general public and still 
  economical. It is very lean and tough, but with a <u>lot</u> of 
  connective tissue in it, making it moist, tender and very flavorful 
  with long cooking. Ideal for braises and stews. These weigh about 
  3-3/4 ounces each.</td></tr>

  The Jowl is just below the cheek, and is very different from the cheek. 
  Fresh Pork Jowl Meat is an unusual cut here in North America, it's just 
  the thickness of the meat layer. For the more familiar cured products 
  (Hog Jowl Bacon and Guanciale), which use the whole thickness, see our 
  <a href="ap_pigp.html"><b>Pork Products</b></a> page.

  Pig ears are prized for their unique textures, chewy or gelatinous 
  (depending on how long they are cooked) on the outside and crunchy in the 
  inside. They are often used in Asian salads. The photo specimens were about 
  8-3/4 inches long, 6-5/8 inches wide and weighed a little over 3/4 pound

  Tails are popular in most pig raising regions and treated similarly to 
  pig feet, but they are meatier with a lot less tendons. Those shown in the 
  photo were prepared in the way normal for Asian markets, cut to lengths 
  and split in half lengthwise. The one in the center of the photo was 
  8-1/2 inches long. Markets for other ethnic populations may prepare them 
  less thoroughly.</td></tr>

  Pig feet are widely used throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico and parts of 
  South America, both to add body to soups and stews and cooked on their own 
  or pickled. The photo shows the common form, just the foot, and the long 
  form with hock. Feet weigh between 14 ounces and 1-1/2 pounds, "long feet"

  separately. The sub-mucosa membrane layer is also stripped off to make 
  sausage casings, which are easily available here in Asian markets.

  Not actually fat, though it is fatty. This is the mesentary of the pig, a 
  fold of the body cavity wall that serves to hold the small intestine in 
  place, yet give it a lot of freedom to expand and contract. Preparing this 
  as an appetizer, <a href="../recipes/sam_bulak1.html">Chicharong Bulaklak</a> 
  is a Philippine specialty.</td></tr>

  This is a fatty membrane (greater omentum) from the inside of the pig's 
  body cavity. It is held highly desirable for a number of European recipes 
  as a wrapper that will automatically baste what it is wrapped around. The 
  photo specimen, laid out, not stretched, on a 12 x 18 inch cutting board, 
  weighed 4-3/8 ounces. It was purchased from the freezer cases of a large 
  Asian market in Los Angeles.</td></tr>

  <td class=nw id="cer"><br></td>
  <td>Pig brains are eaten in some cultures and are particularly popular in 
  the Philippines, but current thinking in North America is that they are not 
  entirely safe. I have not seen them for sale in Southern California. 
  At this writing (2010) there is an onging investigation of severe 
  nervous problems at a pig processing plant where the brains were blown out 
  with compressed air.</td></tr>

<tr><th rowspan="1">Testicles<br>(Pork Fries)</th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td>Pig testicles are popular in Romania but are pretty much unavailable 
  in North America. Here nearly all male pigs are castrated right after 
  birth when their testicles are still too undeveloped for sale. Sheep 
  testicles are fairly available and can be used as a substitute.</td></tr>

  This part cuts into uniquely shaped pieces with a texture that's 
  equally unique. They can be served simmered in sauces or as an 
  appetizer with dips.
