<p>
This is salt cured pork fat back. It may be brine cured or dry salt cured, 
as was the photo specimen. It usually has a layer of skin, and sometimes 
a thin layer of meat on the other side. East Slavic versions are 
sometimes cured with salt and paprika, while South Slavic versions are 
sometimes smoked. Salo may be slice thin and eaten raw on rye bread, 
or similarly, or it may be cooked, used in recipes much like Salt Pork.
<p> 

<p>Products like Salo and Salt Pork were formerly a very popular 
ingredient in American cuisine, but fell out of favor due to the 
American Heart Association's misguided vendetta against the natural 
fats we evolved with in favor of deadly trans fats.  Back in the mid 
19th century Americans practically lived on pig fat, and congestive 
heart disease was almost unknown then. This was actually pointed out 
by an elderly cardiologist at the kick-off for the AHA's "Heart Healthy 
Diet".</p>
 
<p>Now that much of the AHA's "modern medical knowledge" has been totallhy 
discredited, and even the role of saturated fats is being strongly 
re-examined, cooks can feel free to return to these flavorful traditional 
ingredients. Pig fat, by the way, has a better health profile than 
butter, even by the AHA's reconning - much less saturated fat than 
butter (44% vs 65%) and more of the healthy monounsaturated fats 
(45% vs 30%).</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product has recently (late 2018) started 
to appear in the refrigerated meat cases of markets serving a Central 
European community here in Los Angeles. The photo specimen, 11 ounces, 
was made by Bandi Foods of Van Nuys, California, and sold for 2019 US 
$10.59 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; This product is so heavily salted it will 
probably last forever in the refrigerator if tightly sealed in 
plastic.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; For some uses there is no prep. For others you 
may want to cut to size and simmer in a saucepan of water for 10 minutes 
or so to cut down the amount of salt. The skin is usually not included 
because it is so tough.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Salo is often simply sliced very thin and 
eaten on bread or crackers - the skin acts as a cutting board. It is 
also used in recipes similarly to how Salt Pork is used. When it is 
all used except the skin, the skin is usually tossed into a pot where 
soup stock is being made.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Salt Pork (for cooking applications).<p></p>
