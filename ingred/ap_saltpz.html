<p>
  Salt Pork is brined pork belly, the same as bacon but not smoked, 
  and with the skin on. It was formerly a very popular ingredient in American 
  cuisine, but fell out of favor due to the American Heart Association's 
  misguided vendetta against the natural fats we evolved with in favor of 
  deadly trans fats.  Back in the mid 19th century Americans practically 
  lived on pig fat, and congestive heart disease was almost unknown then. 
  This was actually pointed out by an elderly cardiologist at the kick-off 
  for the AHA's "Heart Healthy Diet".</p>
 
  <p>Now that much of the AHA's "modern medical knowledge" has been totallhy 
  discredited, and even the role of saturated fats is being strongly 
  re-examined, cooks can feel free to return to this flavorful traditional 
  ingredient. Pig fat, by the way, has a better health profile than butter, 
  even by the AHA's reconning - much less saturated fat than butter 
  (44% vs 65%) and more of the healthy monounsaturated fats (45% vs 30%).</p>

<p>Today, most Americans are familiar with this product only in the form 
of the one tiny piece included in a can of "pork and beans".</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Hormel brand is fairly available, particularly 
in markets serving Mexican or central and eastern European communities. 
It comes vacuum packed in 12 ounce blocks. Ingredients: Cured with water, 
salt, sugar, dextrose, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Salt pork today has much less salt than it did 
back in the 19th century and needs to be refrigerated. Keeping properties 
are similar to bacon. As with bacon, if you see a touch of mold, cut it 
off and use rest of the block right away.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Salt pork is generally cut to the size you will use 
and simmered in a saucepan of water for 10 minutes or so to cut down the 
amount of salt. Traditional recipes may call for long soaking or more 
simmering than is needed today. The skin is normally left on.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Use as per recipe.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Pork belly and a little salt, or
