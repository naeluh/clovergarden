<h1>Pork Shoulder Picnic Roast (Fresh)</h1>

[#405, 405A]
<p>
The portion of the front leg above the hocks and below the 
<a href="ap_bbuttz.html">Pork Butt Roast (Boston Butt)</a>. See also 
Picnic Ham for the smoked and cured version. This is a large cut which is 
often roasted intact, skin-on and bone-in, and a very fine roast it is. 
It's a fairly lean cut with plenty of meat and big bones through the 
center, and any chef will tell you there's lots of flavor near the 
bone.</p> 

<p>If you can't handle skin and bones see <a href="ap_bbuttz.html">Pork 
Butt Roast</a>. The skin and bones are critical flavor elements and you 
aren't going to get anything near the same without them. There is also 
a Boneless Pork Picnic Shoulder listed, but it's a disorderly cut and 
not common around here, </p>

<p>The Picnic Shoulder is also a very interesting piece for parting out, 
particularly if you have recipes requiring skin (the whole underside of 
the unit in the photo is covered with skin). An 8 pound shoulder will 
yield 4-1/2 pounds of clear meat without fat, 10 ounces of skin, only 
1/3 cup of fat rendered from the cracklings and a good 2 quarts of 
soup stock, particularly good if you splinter the bones.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is working muscle so it has more flavor but needs more 
cooking time to bring it tender than a pork loin or rib roast would.</p>
