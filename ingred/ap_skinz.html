<h1>Pig Skins</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
While the skins of beef and sheep are almost always made into leather, 
pig skins are a culinary prize prepared in numerous ways, particularly 
in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia. Of course their use to make 
American footballs is also well known. The photo shows the inside side 
of a skin recovered from a picnic shoulder roast and properly scraped 
to remove excess fat (which should be rendered into lard and tasty 
cracklings). This skin weighed 1/2 pound, but one from a leg would 
weigh about 3/4 pound.

<h2>Fresh Pig Skins</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_skin26e.jpg" alt="Roll of PIg Skin" class=mrg>
[Cuero de Puerco]
<p>
Because the skins are commercially important, both for selling fresh and 
for processing into Pork Rinds, meat processors have special machines to 
remove the fat from the inside side. Buying commercially prepared pig 
skins avoids the difficult and tedious job of scraping the fat by hand. 
The roll shown is from a pork belly. Hide recovered from other parts of 
the pig may be thicker and will be folded rather than rolled.</p>
<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Your best chance of finding commercial pig skins 
is in a Carniceria (Mexican meat market) or meat section of a regular 
market that serves a heavily Mexican community.<p></p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For most recipes, such as Thai pig skin salads, 
pork belly skin should be simmered for about 45 minutes. Skin from other 
parts of the pig may take a bit longer. It is done when still slightly 
chewy, but not too much if it will be served cold because it will firm up 
quite a bit when cold. To make chicharr&oacute;nes the skin is first 
thoroughly dried.

<h2>Pickled Pig Skins</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_skinpickle03e.jpg" alt="Pickled Pig Skin Strips" class=mrg>
Jars of pickled pig skins are often found in markets serving a Mexican 
community. Unfortunately some brands are badly made, overcooked until 
mushy and packed with too much vinegar. A proper pickled pig skin should 
be firm, moderately chewy and pickled in a moderate vinegar brine. The 
photo specimens were by Faraon, a reliable specialty distributor in 
Los Angeles, and they were excellent. See also our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/gam_pigskpkl1.html"><b>Pickled Pig Skins</b></a> for 
how to make them yourself.

<h2>Pork Rinds - Chicharr&oacute;n Delgado</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_skin24e.jpg" alt="Fried Pig Skins" class=mrg>
[Chicharr&oacute;n de Cerdo]
<p>
A popular snack in the United states, pork skins dried, then deep fried. 
Consumption peaked very high during the Atkins diet craze but has now 
dropped back to a minor item. The term "delgado" means thin, to 
differentiate from "gordito", thick. Caution: in Spanish speaking 
countries other than Mexico and the U.S. "Chicharr&oacute;n" can mean 
something quite different, and not always involving pig skins or even 
pig. Chicharr&oacute;n describes a cooking method, not an ingredient.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were up to 15 inches long and weighed about 3-1/2 
ounces per piece, costing US $4.99/pound, They were purchased from a large 
market serving Altadena, CA, a mixed white, Mexican and black community 
in the process of gentrification. Purchased this way they tend to be less 
salty than packaged products, salt being the main health complaint against 
this snack food (they have no carbs, high protein and less fat than potato 
chips). This form is not ideal for <a href="../recipes/xmm_pigrind1.html">
<b><i>Chicharr&oacute;nes en Salsa Verde</i></b></a> as they become too 
chewy when exposed to the salsa, for that you want the lightest, 
fluffiest chicharr&oacute;nes you can get. For the ultimate in light and 
fluffy make them yourself by our "no splatter" recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/xam_chicher1.html"><b>Chicharr&oacute;nes</b></a>.

<h2>Chicharr&oacute;n Gordito</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_skin22e.jpg" alt="Fried Thick Pig Skins" class=mrg>
[Chicharr&oacute;n de Puerco]
<p>
The name meaning "thick", these pork rinds have the fat layer and some 
meat included. The place I bought them from keeps them quite hot, but they 
are still much better purchased from a street vendor right out of the pan 
when the meat part will still be very tender. They are not as fatty as you'd 
think because most of the fat is rendered out, but they are fattier than 
chicharr&oacute;nes delgado.
