<h1>Smoked Pork Parts</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
alt curing followed by smoking has been a standard method of preserving 
parts of pigs for thousands of years. Today it is no longer simply a 
strategy for preservation, though it does extend the refrigerated life 
of many meats. Today it is valued mainly for the flavor and texture it 
imparts.</p>
<p>Smoking has long used been used from the British Isles all they way 
to China. Smoking was also used by the American Indians, but they had 
no pigs, and in general they didn't have the salt for proper curing. 
Dry smoked, uncured buffalo just isn't going to be same.

<p>By our current methods, meat is almost never just smoked. It is first 
cured with salt. Using a dry process, a very small amount of potassium 
or sodium nitrate (saltpeter) is added to the salt to enhance flavor, 
produce an attractive color and protect the meat from bacteria. Using a 
wet process, an even smaller amounts of sodium or potassium nitrite is 
used for the same purpose.</p>

<h2>Bacon</h2>
<br><a href="ap_bacon.html">
<img src="img/ap_bacon02d.jpg" alt="Two Slices of Bacon" class=mrg></a>
Perhaps the most popular and flavorful cured pork product is bacon - 
salt cured and usually smoked pork belly, Many favor it with an almost 
religious devotion. There is also Back Bacon, called "bacon" in the 
British Isles and much of Canada, and called "Canadian bacon" here. It is 
more like a bland ham than like real bacon and is not worthy of religious 
devotion, but is sometimes an acceptable breakfast ingredient if not 
overcooked. There are other kinds as well, including Chinese and 
Hungarian bacon, so bacon is a large subject and has its own 
<a href="ap_bacon.html"><b>Bacon</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Ham</h2>
<br><a href="ap_hams.html">
<img src="img/ap_hamsf08e.jpg" alt="Slice of Virginia Ham" class=mrg></a>
Ham is properly a pig's hind leg, but the term is also sometimes used for 
cured shoulder.  It may be fresh, but is most often cured in salt brine 
and may then be smoked. Hams are cured throughout most of the world, 
including China, but excepting Israel and the Muslim regions. Hams are a 
major subject and have their own <a href="ap_hams.html"><b>Hams</b></a> 
page.
<br class=cll><p></p>
 
<h2>Smoked Ham Hocks</h2>
<br><a href="ap_hockz.html">
<img src="img/ap_hockham05d.jpg" alt="Two Ham Hocks" class=mrg></a>
These are available in the refrigerated cases of most well stocked markets 
as they are still much favored in the American South. They take a fair amount 
of cooking to be edible and are often used as a flavoring ingredient in 
soups and stews. Personally I like to boil them up, then refrigerate them 
and use them as snacks, cutting off a piece now and then. Find more detail 
and cooking information see our 
<a href="ap_hockz.html"><b>Ham Hocks</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Pork Loin</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_loinsmk02d.jpg" alt="Two Slices Smoked Loin" class=mrg>
This is a common recipe ingredient. It is much milder than the other 
smoked products on this page, lightly cured and lightly smoked. It has 
fairly good refrigerated shelf life and will be found in the refrigerated 
cases of well stocked meat departments. It is made from the loin, which 
is where pork chops come from, so the meat has a relatively mild flavor 
itself. This makes for an ingredient that will provide some smoked meat 
flavor but not overwhelm a recipe. The photo specimens were 5 inches by 
5 inches and 1/2 inch thick. Note that these slices are bone-in, whereas 
the very similarly cut Canadian bacon would be without bones.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Pork Tongues</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_toungs02d.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Pig Tongues" class=mrg>
These tongues had both good firm texture and excellent flavor for use as 
sliced snacks. They were 6 inches long and weighed 4.2 ounces each. 
These were purchased at a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 
US 2015 $5.79 / pound. Made by Mama Vickey's Foods in North Hollywood, 
California. Ingred: Pork tongue, salt, cure #1. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Pork Ribs</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_ribsmk03d.jpg" alt="Block of Smoked Pork Side" class=mrg>
You want flavor? We have flavor, right here. The photo specimen is from 
one end of a slice of pork side about 3-3/4 inches wide and 2-1/2 inches 
thick. The whole piece was about 14 inches long and cut from the spare 
ribs part of the pig. The slice includes the ribs, bacon layer and skin. 
It's bacon cured and strongly smoked. Roasted it is awesome. Roasting 
method right here: <a href="../recipes/gam_pigribsm1.html"><b>Smoked 
Pork Ribs, Roasted</b></a>.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Cured Pork Tenderloin</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_lointcur02f.jpg" alt="Whole Pork Tenderloin" class=mrg>
This cut is found on the inside side of the loin and often processed as 
a separate part. While the uncured tenderloin is mild in flavor, this 
product is meant as a snack item, so the cure is quite distinct and it 
ends up tasting similar to a fairly strongly flavored ham. The photo 
specimen was 10 inches long, 2-1/2 inches across the big end, and weighed 
14-1/8 ounces. Cured with water, garlic, salt, sugar, sodium nitrite.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Pig Tails</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_tail04d.jpg" alt="Two Smoked Pig Tails" class=mrg>
These are available in the refrigerated deli cases of well stocked 
markets, particularly those serving European or American Southeast 
communities. Properly made they have very good flavor and will be 
appreciated by people who enjoy gnawing on things. It's best to slice 
the skin into bite size squares before starting to gnaw. Tails actually 
have a fair amount of meat on them.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Neck Bones</h2>
<br><img src="img/ap_neckbs02d.jpg" alt="Three Neck Bones" class=mrg>
Unlike pig tails, these are not good for gnawing on. They have plenty of 
meat but no skin, and the meat is almost impossible to get at until 
cooked so well if falls off the bones. These are an excellent ingredient 
for flavoring soups and stews. When simmered for 2-1/2 hours or so, the 
meat can easily be picked off, returned to the pot, and the bones 
discarded. These can be found in the refrigerated deli cases of well 
stocked markets, particularly those serving an American Southeast 
community.
