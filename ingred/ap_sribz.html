Spare ribs underlie the front portion of the Pork Belly cut. The photo 
specimen is cut lengthwise "Santa Barbara style". The upper section, if 
sold separately, would be "Saint Louis Ribs". Be aware, if using English 
recipes, that in the UK "Spare Ribs" is a cut from the top of the shoulder 
and actually contains no ribs (see

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Spare ribs can be had, at widely varying prices,
in practically any market that sells meat - except kosher and hilal 
butcher shops. It doesn't seem to make a lot of difference whether the 
ribs are "fresh" or "previously frozen".<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; for most recipes you will want to separate the ribs 
and more often than not cut them to specific lengths. For both these tasks 
by far the easiest method is to use a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife 
and a soft faced mallet with which to drive it through bone and 
cartilage.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Spare ribs are cooked just about any way you can 
cook meat, everything from simmered in soup to roasted on the grill.
