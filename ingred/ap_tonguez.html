<h1>Pork Tongues</h1>

<p>
Pork tongues are eaten by pretty much every culture where pig is a 
significant item in the diet. They are not nearly as fatty as cow tongues 
but like them are sometimes pickled. The photo specimen was 7-3/4 inches 
long and weighed 12-1/4 ounces. It cooked down to 7 ounces. </p>
<p>Pig tongues are particularly convenient when you are trying to do a 
recipe that calls for ony a small amount of beef tongue - just don't 
cook the pig tongue as long as for a beef tongue.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Pig tongues can generally be found in ethnic 
markets (except those serving primarily Jewish or Muslim communities, 
of course). They are particularly common in markets serving Asian, Latin 
American and Eastern European communities. They may be cut as in the 
photo, or may be cut flatter with much less of the root on the underside.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Tongue is always cooked whole.
<ol>
<li>Wash <b>Tongue</b> well and cut away any excess fat, plumbing or other 
  icky bits.</li>
<li>Put the Tongue in a pot with water to cover and add a good doloup 
  of <b>Vinegar</b>. Use plenty of water as the tongue will curl and swell. 
  Bring to a boil for about 2 minutes. Remove Tongue and discard water.</li>
<li>Return Tongue to the pot with fresh water. You may also put in 
  Onion slices, Garlic, Bay leaf and Herbs and Spices, as you desire or 
  as called for by your recipe.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil and simmer slowly until done - 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Test 
  doneness with a sharp skewer though the thickest part - it should not 
  encounter a resistant spot in the center.</li>
<li>Lift Tongue from the broth and cool just enough to handle. Peel off 
  the skin and return to the broth to finish cooling. Note: some pig 
  tongues don't peel easily - if so, leave the skin on. Some people even 
  leave on the much tougher skin on beef tongues.</li>
<li>Some recipes call for using the broth, which needs to be strained and 
  defatted (using your gravy separator).</li>
<li>Slice or dice the Tongue as required by your recipe.</li>
</ol>
