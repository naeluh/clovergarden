<h1>Pig Uterus</h1>
<br><img src="img/ap_uterus02g.jpg" alt="Pig Uterus" class=mrg>
Yes, even this part of the pig is enjoyed on the dinner plate. It 
doesn't at all resemble a human uterus, because it's designed to 
manufacture a whole slew of piglets. The human uterus is designed 
for just one, though it can sometimes safely accomodate two, and 
with rapidly declining safety beyond that. Pig Uterus is different 
in shape and texture from any other part of the pig, so it is 
handled rather differently from other parts.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; this is not a problem here in Southern 
California, as our huge Asian markets are usually well supplied. 
It can be had at a fairly low cost, as not many know how to cook 
it, or want to try.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp;  Prepared and fully cooked, you will end up with 
about 40% the weight you started with. Recipes should list the starting 
weight unless specifically stated otherwise.<p></p>


<h3>Clean &amp; Cut</h3>
<br><img src="img/ap_uterus05e.jpg" alt="Pig Uterus, cleaned and cut" class=mrg> 
Because of it's unique characteristics, and especially it's smoothness 
and hollowness, the Uterus is cut quite differently from other parts of 
the pig. 
<ol>
<li>Rinse the Uterus thoroughly.</li>
<li>Cut away as much of the thin membrane as you can so you just have 
  the tubular part.</li>
<li>Cut the tubular part into lengths of about 2 inch crescents, then 
  make many cuts on from the convex side extending through the wall 
  into the interior tube. This will allow quicker cooking and will 
  give some purchase for sauces it may be cooked in, or for dips if 
  served as an appetizer.</li>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<br><img src="img/ap_uterus08e.jpg" alt="Pig Uterus, Cooked" class=mrg> 
Pig uterus is usually cooked in a sauce, but it can be served also as 
an appetizer with dips. This is a tough item with a somewhat crunchy 
bite. Thee flavor stays the same even throug a couple of hours simmering.

<p>Uterus is first edible after simmering 25 to 30 minutess, and still 
has quite a bit of crunch. It becomes less chewy with further simmering, 
and by 1 hour it is fairly easy to eat. The crunchiness will have faded 
a lot, but most people will probably prefer the texture at about 1 hour. 
After 1 hour it continues to become more tender, but the change is not 
great.</p>
