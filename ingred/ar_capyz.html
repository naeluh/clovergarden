Native to South America, the capybara is the largest rodent alive 
today and grows to over 140 pounds. Extinct capybaras were much larger 
with <i>Josephoartigasia monesi</i> exceeding 2200 pounds. Capybaras are 
doing well today and have a conservation status of LC (Least Concern) 
though hunting them has been restricted in some areas where populations 
have declined.</p>
<p>Capybaras are semi-aquatic, living in most of South America but 
avoiding the Andes mountains. They are easy going and allow people to 
pet them but they do not make good pets because they are unhappy taken 
from their family, and they occasionally bite and get pushy.

<p>Back in 2006/2007 a new sign was purchased for the California Visitors 
Information Center along the Santa Monica freeway. These signs normally 
feature the silhouette of a California bear. Unfortunately, the painter 
of this sign wasn't too familiar with bears. By time it was replaced the 
silhouette he painted had been identified as that of a capybara.</p>

<p>There are actually plenty of capybaras on exhibit in Southern 
California, particularly at the Santa Anna and Santa Barbara Zoos, as 
the weather here is highly suitable for them. There may be some in the 
wild in Louisiana.</p>

<p>In South America capybaras are eaten and are reputed to be very much 
like pork. The meat is often dried, salted, shredded and seasoned. 
Capybara meat is particularly popular during Lent because the Catholic 
Church has identified these semi-aquatic rodents as fish, and fish is 
allowed during Lent. While I'm sure someone in Los Angeles sells 
capybara, I haven't found any yet.</p> 

<p>Capybaras have very tough hide which is used to make a durable 
leather.</p>

<p>I know of no unusual risks in eating capybara except being bitten by 
one or pummeled by animal enthusiasts with whom they are quite popular.
