<p>
<p>Marmots are large Ground Squirrels that can be found in North America, 
the Alpine region of Europe, the Himalayas, Central Asia, Siberia, 
Mongolia, and northern China. The North America Woodchuck is also a 
Marmot, but it already has its own <a href="ar_woodz.html"><b>WoodChuck 
/ Groundhog</b></a> page. Here we consider just the ones hunted and eaten 
in Mongolia, the only other region where Marmot is much on the menu.</p>
<p>The two Marmots listed above have an overlapping range from Kazakhstan 
through southwest Siberia, Mongolia and northwestern China. They usually 
weigh between 9 and 14 pounds, but can weigh up to 18 pounds. when 
nearing hibernation.</p>
<p>The Tarbagan Marmot is ICUN Red Listed as Endangered (it's the one 
most hunted in Mongolia). The Gray Marmot, and nearly all other Marmots, 
including the Woodchuck, are ICUN Red Listed as Least Concern.

<h3>Boodog:</h3> &nbsp; This is the recipe by which Marmots are cooked 
in Mongolia, usually the Tarbagan marmot. They are difficult to hunt as 
they are wary, and it's hard to get within rifle range, and if they are 
wounded and make it back to their burrow, they have to be dug out. 
Nonetheless, the Tarbagan is the only Marmot ICUN Red Listed as 
Endangered.</p>

<p>The photo shows a kerosene blow torch being used by a Mongolian to 
burn the fur off a Marmot. The beast is then disemboweled and boned. It 
is cooked by pouring hot rocks into its body cavity. Talk about Paleo, 
this is really Paleo - except the kerosene torch is just pre-Victorian.

<p><b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; Marmots can carry Plague, so they must be 
handled with care to avoid direct exposure, breathing body fluids, or 
being bitten by their fleas. They should be cooked "well done" - In 
2019 a Mongolian couple died of Plague after eating raw Marmot meat.
