[Musquash; Marsh Rabbit; <i>Ondatra zibethicus</i>]
<p>
Muskrats are semi-aquatic rodents native to North America, but were 
introduced into Europe in the early 1900s for their then valuable fur. 
Since then they have spread all the way from France to Kamchatka and 
are well established in that range. They have also been introduced to 
some ranges in South America. They are considered serious pests 
in Holland and Belgium because they dig big holes in dikes, but 
otherwise don't seem to be much of a problem.</p>
<p>Not true rats, but related to hamsters and lemmings, muskrats 
are medium size, weighing up to 4 pounds and about 13 inches long, plus 
11 inches of tail. The tail is scaly and flattened, but vertically, not 
horizontally like the beaver. Muskrats may dig burrows to live in, or 
may build lodges similar to those of beavers, but made from lighter 
materials. They are another animal permitted on meatless Fridays and 
Lent because the Catholic Church has classified them as fish. 
Muskrats are plentiful and IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

<p>Muskrats are native to most of North America, but are particularly 
favored as a food item in the Great Lakes region and the Northeast from 
Virginia through Maine. They were considered a very important animal 
by the American Indians in those regions, and are still eaten by the 
regional tribes. Most muskrat stew recipes are directly related to 
American Indian practices.</p>

<p>The steps given here are a little tedious, but I have read reports by 
persons who tried to cook muskrat without going through them all, and 
suffered the consequences.</p>

<b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Muskrats are most commonly available frozen. In 
some regions frozen Muskrat may be provided by fish markets. Here in 
Southern California, I purchased the photo specimen from Hawaii 
Supermarket, a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), but 
Muskrat is not a common item there. It was frozen, tightly wrapped in 
heavy plastic film. The photo to the left shows the specimen after 
thawing. It weighed 1.84 pounds and cost 2016 US $8.99 / pound.</p>
<p>In some regions Muskrats can be purchased directly from trappers, 
generally skinned and gutted, but not otherwise cleaned. The season 
varies from state to state, but is roughly November 1st to February 
28th. In some locations muskrat festivals are held during this period.
</p>

<p><b>Skinning, etc:</b> &nbsp; Preparing a whole skin-on muskrat is a 
little complicated, because the musk glands must be removed without 
breaking them, and all fat must be removed, especially fat on the 
underside of the four legs. Unfortunately I've found very little good 
information on the Internet for skinning muskrats for food rather 
than fur. Southern California is completely devoid of muskrats, so I 
have not had the opportunity to work with them.  Just work carefully.
</p>

<p><b>Final Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Commercially frozen muskrat probably 
has the musk glands removed, but if obtained directly from a trapper 
the beast will be skinned and gutted, but nothing further. In either 
case, it is important to carefully remove anything that looks like a 
gland, particularly under the front legs and near the back legs and 
internally. Remove any and all fat and any other white material. I 
use my fish filleting knife for this, as it has the razor sharpness 
and delicacy to do the job quickly and precisely. Should a musk gland 
be broken and contaminate the meat, it takes about 3 days of soaking 
in many changes of salt water to make it edible.</p>

<p><b>Cutting:</b> &nbsp; Disjoint the Muskrat and cut into pieces 
the size you want, but not too small or bones will be difficult to 
deal with on the plate. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
by a soft faced mallet works best for some of the cuts. In Indian 
tribes, the muskrat is often just tossed in the pot, head-on and 
"teeth showing", with other ingredients loaded over it. I prefer to 
remove the head for aesthetic reasons, especially if serving guests.
</p>

<p><b>Soaking:</b> &nbsp; Wash the Muskrat well. You will soon notice 
that blood continues to seep out and the wash water never runs clean. 
Once you have much reduced the color of the water, put the Muskrat 
in a stainless steel pot. Add water to just cover, and a heaping 
tablespoon of salt. Set it in a cool place and let it sit overnight. 
I prefer to do one change of the salt water during this time, but 
most recipes don't call for that.</p>

<p><b>Par Boiling:</b> &nbsp; Drain the Muskrat and wash well. Put in 
a pot with plenty of water to cover well. Over high heat, bring it 
to a boil for about 2 minutes. Pour out and refresh with cold water. 
Wash the Muskrat (and the pot) well.</p>

<p><b>Holding:</b> &nbsp; Since I have done the par boiling in the 
morning after the overnight soak, and I intend to cook the muskrat in 
the evening, I drain it well and pack it into a sealed plastic bag, 
which I put in the fridge.</p>
