<h1>Rabbits, Jackrabbits <small>&amp;</small> Hares</h1>
<br><img src="img/ar_rabbit02e.jpg" alt="Cute Rabbit with Carrot" class=mrg>
[(family <i>Leporidae</i>), <i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i> 
  (European rabbit), <i>Sylvilagus</i> species (American cottontail 
  rabbit), <i>Lepus</i> species (Hares)]
<p>
Popularly, rabbits are thought of as rodents, but they actually 
belong to order <i>Lagomorpha</i>, not <i>Rodentia</i> - though the two 
orders are more closely related than once thought. All domesticated and 
pet rabbits are of the single European species (<i>O. cuniculus</i>) 
found wild all across Europe and now Australia where it has become quite 
the pest.</p>
<p>American cottontail rabbits range from parts of South America through 
pretty much all of North America. While often hunted for food, they are 
not farmed. Hares and Jackrabbits (genus <i>Lepus</i>) are similar to 
rabbits but generally have longer ears, run faster and do not burrow. 
Like cottontails, they are hunted but not farmed.</p>
<p>Rabbits make good pets and are easily taught to use a litter box. 
They are, however, not good around small children as they are a bit 
fragile and also might bite if startled. They are also not good around 
computers as they mistake wires and cables for roots and chew them to 
pieces. Also, the males tend to get a bit horny and may try to hump your 
foot or other objects.

<p>Rabbit has been described as "chicken without wings". It is used 
similarly and tastes similar to the dark meat of a free range chicken. 
It is, however, more delicate in texture (chicken is stringier). Wild 
rabbit hare and jackrabbit does, of course, have a stronger "gamier" 
flavor than farmed rabbit.

<p>In Southern California rabbit tends to be on the expensive side, 
though less costly purchased from one of the big Asian markets. If 
economy is a real issue, use chicken thigh meat in place of rabbit, 
cut in a way where the stringiness won't be too noticeable.</p>

Unless you live near a rabbit producer (or are one) you're going to get 
your rabbit dressed and frozen as in the photo. You can cut it apart 
similarly to how you would cut a chicken into pieces. The photo specimen 
weighed 2-3/4 pounds, fairly typical.</p>

<p>Rabbits are vegetarian so they will not have trichinosis and need not be 
over cooked.</p>

<p><b>Do Not</b> discard the bones and offcuts, rabbit makes an excellent 
soup stock. If you don't have enough, combine it with some chicken bones 
and offcuts.

<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Rabbit meat is high in protein and very low in fat. There are no 
particular diseases or disorders to worry about with commercial rabbit.
