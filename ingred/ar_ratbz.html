<h1>Rice Rat</h1>
<br><img src="img/ar_bandi02k.jpg" alt="Three Rice Rats Captured" class=mrg>
[Bandicoot Rat, Rice field rats, <i>Bandicota bengalensis</i> 
(lesser bandicoot rat) <i>Bandicota indica</i> (greater bandicoot rat)]
<p>
The greater and lesser bandicoot rat, not the common rat, are the rats 
eaten in Southeast Asia and southern China. Not related to the real 
bandicoot (an Australian marsupial), they are major pests in rice and 
wheat fields throughout Southeast Asia and India. While they are hunted, 
trapped and eaten in great quantity conservation status is LC (Least 
Concern) because they breed at a stunning rate.</p>
<p>These rats are much larger and plumper than the common rat and the 
tail is proportionately shorter. For <i>B. indica</i> head/body length 
is about 10 inches and overall length is 16 inches. &nbsp; <small>Photo

<p>While California and Texas grow large quantities of rice, we have no 
bandicoot rats, and the USDA is unlikely to approve introducing them. I 
would not be surprised if frozen ones are available somewhere in the vast 
LA/Orange County metropolis, but I haven't encountered them. It is unknown 
if common rat is a suitable substitute but it's way too small to be worth 
trying anyway.</p>

<p>To prepare a rat (presuming it is already dead):
<ol>
<li>Cut off it's tail and feet, then make a cut through the skin around 
the neck behind the ears. Grasp the rat by the head and pull the skin 
entirely off.</li>
<li>Cut off the head and discard.</li>
<li> Slit the belly being careful not to cut so deep you cut the innards. 
Now pull out all the innards, except the heart and liver are often left 
in.</li>
<li>At this point larger rats are simply marinated with seasonings and 
roasted over hot coals until well done. Smaller rats may be roasted until 
just done, then made into ground rat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>The main risk involved with eating bandicoot rats is from programs to 
poison them. Make sure your rats come from an area where no poisoning is 
being done. This is not a problem in North America because there are no 
bandicoot rats here.</p>
