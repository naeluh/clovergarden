<h1>Common Rat</h1>
<br><img src="img/ar_rat02g.jpg" alt="Live Brown Rat" class=mrg>
[[Roof rat, Ship rat, Black rat, <i>Rattus rattus</i> | Brown rat, 
  Sewer rat, Norwegian rat, Common rat, Wharf rat, 
  <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> | other species are relatively rare]]
<p>
Native to tropical Asia (<i>R. rattus</i>) and China (<i>R. 
norvegicus</i>) rats had spread throughout the Old World by Roman 
times, and throughout the rest of the world aboard European ships in 
the 1500s. Here in Los Angeles we have roof rats (mostly medium gray) 
but in cooler parts of North America the much larger brown rat 
predominates (photo). The various strains of laboratory rats were 
developed from <i>R. norvegicus</i>.</p>
<p>While despised as filthy in the wild, rats kept as pets are found 
to be clean, friendly and intelligent. Most pet rats are fancier 
breeds of <i>R. norvegicus</i>. Common rat is not much cooked except 
in extreme circumstances because it's just not meaty enough to bother 
with.

<p>I am not aware, at this time, of anyone eating common rats except in 
cases of extreme hardship. Rats are commonly eaten in Asia but those are 
<a href="ar_ratbz.html">Rice Field Rats</a> (bandicoot rats) which are 
much larger and meatier than even a plump <i>R. norvegicus</i>, never 
mind <i>R. rattus</i>. They are also safer and more consistent because 
you know what they've been eating.</p>

<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Rats are notorious carriers of disease, but highly adaptable and 
impossible to exterminate. The blood anticoagulant warfarin was thought 
to be the end of rats but is now being incorporated by some rats as a 
nutrient. <i>R. rattus</i> was probably the main spreader of plague and 
typhus in Europe, but here in Los Angeles County these diseases are 
rarely found associated with rats because the necessary flea vector 
(<i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>) is seldom found on them.</p>

<p>Eating wild rats in North America cannot be recommended in any case 
because of the many eradication programs that use powerful poisons.</p>
