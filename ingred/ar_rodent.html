<p><span class=bg>Grandorder <i>Glires</i> (rodents and rabbits) is 
sister to Grandorder <i>Euarchonta</i> (that's us, other primates, 
colugos and tree shrews), all lumped under Superorder 
<i>Euarchontoglires</i>. So yes, people are related to rats, some more 
closely than others.</span></p>

<p>Rodents (Order <i>Rodentia</i>) live on all continents except 
Antarctica and account for about 40% of mammalian species (2277 species). 
They range in size from 1/4 ounce (African pygmy mouse) to 140 pounds 
(capybara), but extinct species once ranged to well over 2000 pounds. The 
photo is of a prairie dog, formerly eaten by some American Indians after 
the buffalo were gone.

closely related order <i>Lagomorpha</i> which they share with Pikas 
(rock rabbits, coneys).

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The first identifiable rodents date from the early Paleocene, about 64 
million years ago. Most of the modern groupings were established by the 
end of the Eocene, about 33 million years ago.</p>
<p> Rodents are characterized by a 
pair of very large incisor teeth that grow continuously and are kept under 
control by gnawing on stuff. There is a long gap and then just a few side 
teeth. Most are strictly vegetarian, but a good number are not so 
vegetarian and a few are fairly carnivorous.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>While there are at least 2277 species of rodent, only a few appear on 
the dinner table, and even fewer on the North American dinner table. Here 
we will consider only those commonly eaten or outstandingly interesting 
for some other reason. All rodents (and rabbits) are forbidden by Judaic 
and Islamic dietary laws, but other cultures are far more flexible on 
that issue.</p>

<h2 id="bunny">Rabbit, Jackrabbit <small>&amp;</small> Hare</h2>
<br><a href="ar_rabbitz.html">
<img src="img/ar_rabbit02h.jpg" alt="Cute Bunny with Carrot" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Cony (archaic), (family <i>Leporidae</i>), 
<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i> (European rabbit), <i>Sylvilagus</i> 
species (American cottontail rabbit), <i>Lepus</i> species (Hares and 
Jackrabbits)]
</p><p>
Popularly, rabbits are thought of as rodents, but they actually 
belong to order <i>Lagomorpha</i>, not <i>Rodentia</i> - though the two 
orders are more closely related than once thought. All domesticated and 
pet rabbits are of the single European species (<i>O. cuniculus</i>), 
found wild all across Europe and now Australia where it has become quite 
the pest.</p>
<p>American cottontail rabbits range from parts of South America through 
pretty much all of North America. While often hunted for food, they are 
not farmed. Hares and Jackrabbits (genus <i>Lepus</i>) are similar to 
rabbits but generally have longer ears, run faster and do not burrow. 
Like cottontails, they are hunted but not farmed. &nbsp;

<h2 id="beaver">Beaver</h2>
<br><img src="img/ar_beaver01e.jpg" alt="Live Beaver" class=mrg>
[<i>Castor canadensis</i> (American beaver), <i>Castor fiber</i> 
(European beaver)]
<p>
Beavers are large aquatic rodents noted for building dams that 
create extensive ponds blocking fast moving streams. There are two extant 
species of beaver, and one extinct one that weighed nearly 500 pounds. 
<i>C. fiber</i> had a brush with extinction due to harvesting for its 
testicles and glands for medicinal purposes. Today it is being actively 
reintroduced throughout Europe but is still rated NT (Near Threatened).
</p>
<p>Although heavily harvested in the past for its pelts, particularly for 
making beaver hats, American beavers are doing well and rated as LC (Least 
Concern). Beaver dams are of great importance ecologically, particularly 
for maintaining salmon runs.</p>
<p>Beaver is no longer much eaten (well, <i>Castor</i> isn't, anyway), 
but at the height of the fur trade it was available and cheap. It was 
particularly attractive to Catholics because the Church had declared 
beaver to be a fish, thus beaver could be eaten on meatless Fridays and 
during Lent. Today it'd be a major project to get some beaver meat - 
where it is available it's sold mainly to mink farms. &nbsp;

<h2>Suborder <i>Hystricomorpha</i></h2>

<p>This "Porcupine-like" Suborder has not always been considered 
Rodents, but recent evidence does place them there. Some are called 
"rats", but they are definitely not rats. They are divided into New 
World and Old World species. All originated in Africa, but a bunch 
of them rafted over to South America when the continents were much 
closer.</p>

   <h3>Agouti</h3>

   <i>Dasyprocta punctata</i> (Central American  Agouti) 
   &nbsp; | &nbsp; all of family <i>Dasyproctidae</i>]
   <p>
   These rodents are common in north central South America, with <i>C. 
   punctata</i> extending as far north as southern Mexico. They are 
   fairly large, with <i>punctata</i> growing to a little over 9 pounds, 
   while <i>leporina</i> and <i>fuliginosa</i> grow to a little over 13 
   pounds. They are hunted within their ranges, but are difficult to 
   raise in captivity. While there are other Agouti that are less common, 
   those we list here are all IUCN red list rated LC (least concern).

   <h3>Cane Rat</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ar_caner01k.jpg" alt="Live Cane Rat" class=mrg>

   &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Thryonomys gregorianus</i> (lesser cane rat) 
   &nbsp; | &nbsp; both of family <i>Thryonomyidae</i>]
   <p>
   Cane rats live in most of sub-Saharan Africa, and are considered 
   serious agricultural pests, particularly around cane plantations. They 
   grow as large as 22 pounds, and despite hunting, their numbers may be 
   increasing due to human farming activity.</p>
   <p>Cane rats are eaten in West and Central Africa and are appreciated 
   for their tender, high protein low fat meat. A breeding program has 
   been established, and several African governments are encouraging 
   farming them. The best substitute easily available in North America 
   is probably Rabbit.

   [Capibara, Chiguiro, Carpincho (Spanish); Capivara (Portuguese); 
   <i>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South America, the capybara is the largest rodent alive 
   today and grows to over 140 pounds. Extinct capybaras were much larger 
   with <i>Josephoartigasia monesi</i> exceeding 2200 pounds. Capybaras are 
   doing well today and have a conservation status of LC (Least Concern), 
   though hunting them has been restricted in some areas where populations 
   have declined.</p>
   <p>Capybaras are semi-aquatic, living in most of South America but 
   avoiding the Andes mountains. They are easy going and allow people to 
   pet them, but they do not make good pets because they are unhappy taken 
   from their family and they occasionally bite and get pushy. &nbsp;

   <h3>Dassie Rat</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ar_dassie02e.jpg" alt="Live Cane Rat" class=mrg>
   [<i>Petromus typicus</i> of family <i>Petromuridae</i>]
   <p>
   Dassies are called "rock rats", but, while they are rodents, they are 
   not rats. They live near the west coast of South Africa, and grow to 
   about 10 ounces.</p>
   <p>I have included them here because there is a possibility of 
   confusion. There are two "dassies" in South Africa, one of which 
   was much eaten by early Dutch settlers, but that one was the 
   <a href="aa_afroso.html#rock">Rock Hyrax</a> (<i>Procavia 
   capensis</i>), which can grow to a little more than 8 pounds (much 
   more edible). The Hyrax looks much like a rodent, but it's closest 
   relatives are the Elephants and Marine Mammals (<i>Sirenia</i>).

   <h3>Desmarest's Hutia</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ar_hutia01e.jpg" alt="Live Hutia" class=mrg>
   [<i>Capromys pilorides</i> of family <i>Capromyidae</i>]
   <p>
   This fairly large rodent is native to the islands of the Cuban 
   archipelago in the Caribbean. Growing to 19 pounds, it is hunted for 
   food on the islands. They have at times been raised in captivity as 
   miniature livestock, and encouraging this is being officially 
   considered.</p> 
   <p>Despite its small range and human predation, this Hutia is 
   numerous and IUCN rated LC (Least Concern). Hunting them is licensed 
   and regulated. Unfortunately there were no regulations when there 
   were giant Hutia, up to 440 pounds. It is possible one species may 
   still have been alive around the time the Spanish arrived.

   [Cuy, Cuyo, Cuni, Cobayo, Conejillos de Indias (South America); 
   Cavy; <i>Cavia porcellus</i> of family <i>Caviidae</i>]
   <p>
   These rodents are native to the Andean region of South America 
   (Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia) - they don't come from Guinea and 
   they aren't pigs. Guinea pigs have been domesticated for probably 7000 
   years by tribes in the Andean region. <i>C. porcellus</i> is no 
   longer found in the wild, but several of its near relatives are.</p>
   <p>Andean households routinely breed guinea pigs for consumption, feeding 
   them vegetable scraps, but to most of the world they are cute, docile, 
   easy to care for pets. Guinea Pigs are moderate size rodents. Pet 
   varieties usually weigh between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds, but meat varieties 
   weigh up to 4 pounds. &nbsp; <a href="ar_guineaz.html"><b>Details and

   <h3>Nutria</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ar_nutria01h.jpg" alt="Live Nutria" class=mrg>
   [Coypu (Spanish); <i>Myocastor coypus</i>]
   <p>Native to southern South America, the nutria is yet another 
   semi-aquatic rodent that has been spread worldwide for its formerly 
   valuable fur. Now it is a very serious pest and destroyer of wetlands in 
   the US, Europe and Asia. Nutria is still being promoted as a get rich 
   scheme - you buy expensive breeding pairs, raise a lot of nutrias and 
   sell the furs and meat to get rich. Of course the market never 
   materializes.</p>
   <p>Nutria are fairly large, weighing up to 20 pounds, and the meat 
   is nutritious, low fat and high protein, similar to guinea pig. Taste 
   and texture are said to be quite similar to rabbit.  Unfortunately, 
   the only places there are markets for the meat is in Kyrgyzstan and 
   Uzbekistan, and there it's sold to people too poor to afford other 
   meats. Nutria were first introduced to California, but eradicated 
   here, and several other states have high profile eradication efforts 
   because of the serious ecological damage they cause. Unfortunately, 
   California is experiencing another costly invasion (2018). To help 
   control them, there are also serious efforts to commercialize Nutria 
   meat for human consumption. They need to get a couple of big name 
   TV chefs behind this - surely it can be sold to yuppies for a premium 
   price. It has also been successfully tested as an ingredient in dog 
   food. &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

   <p>
   These rodents, native to cloud forests and rain forests of Central 
   and South America, can weigh up to 31 pounds (<i>C. paca</i>). 
   Paca meat is considered a delicacy, so they are hunted for food 
   throughout their range. Commercial farming is being considered, since 
   their meat can fetch a premium price.

   Porcupines probably originated in Africa, then infested South America, 
   finally making it to North America about 3 million years ago when 
   Panama rose out of the sea. They are considered good eating throughout 
   their range. The most common culinary varieties, all of  which are 
   IUCN rated "Least Concern", are:</p>
   
   <h3>North American:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Erethizon dorsatum</i>) Native to 
   forests from northern Mexico to Alaska. Arboreal and partially 
   nocturnal, they can grow to 40 pounds, but are usually around 20 
   pounds. They are not farmed or sold in markets due to handling 
   difficulties.

   <h3>Crested Porcupine:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Hystrix cristata</i>) Native 
   to Italy, North Africa and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, these are 
   mostly nocturnal. They can weigh up to 60 pounds, and are widely 
   eaten by humans within their range.<p></p>

   <h3>Cape Porcupine:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Hystrix africaeaustralis</i>) 
   Native from the southern tip of Africa as far north as Congo, these 
   are mostly nocturnal. Weighing up to 66 pounds, this porcupine was 
   much favored by Dutch settlers in South Africa.

<h2>Rats &nbsp; - &nbsp; Superfamily <i>Muroidea</i></h2>

<p>Many animals called "Rat" are not really rats, and most listed here 
are not "true rats", but Superfamily <i>Muroidea</i> does include the 
real rats. Eating rat is strongly forbidden by Judaism and Islam and in 
some South American cultures. While not forbidden to Christians and other 
Pagans, they just aren't considered an appetizing idea in Europe and the 
Americas - though Muskrat has a significant following in North America.</p>
<p>In Asia rat is considered very highly, though it is generally 
Bandicoot Rat or Bamboo Rat rather than common rat that is eaten. 
Restaurants in China are now promoting rat (2011) because they've 
already cooked and served all the snakes that ate rats, so rats are 
plentiful now. Gives a new meaning to "ratatouille", it does.</p>

   wheat fields throughout Southeast Asia and India. While they are 
   hunted, trapped and eaten in great quantity, conservation status is 
   LC (Least Concern) because they breed at an astonishing rate.

   <p>
   Muskrats are semi-aquatic rodents native to North America, but were 
   introduced into Europe in the early 1900s for their then valuable fur. 
   Since then they have spread all the way from France to Kamchatka and 
   are well established in that range. They have also been introduced to 
   some ranges in South America. They are considered serious pests 
   in Holland and Belgium because they dig big holes in dikes, but 
   otherwise don't seem to be much of a problem.</p>
   <p>Not true rats, but related to hamsters and lemmings, muskrats 
   are medium size, weighing up to 4 pounds and about 13 inches long, plus 
   11 inches of tail. The tail is scaly and flattened, but vertically, not 
   horizontally like the beaver. Muskrats may dig burrows to live in, or 
   may build lodges similar to those of beavers, but made from lighter 
   materials. They are another animal permitted on meatless Fridays and 
   Lent because the Catholic Church has classified them as fish. 
   Muskrats are plentiful and IUCN rated LC (Least Concern). Cooking 
   Muskrat so it is edible requires unusual and very specific steps.

[Fuzzy tailed tree rat; family <i>Sciuridae</i>]
<p>
Squirrels are divided into tree living (arboreal) and burrowing 
ground squirrel categories. Some of the arboreal varieties are known as 
"flying squirrels" because they've developed large flaps of skin that 
allow them to glide from tree to tree. Flying squirrels are too small to 
be of culinary interest.</p>
<p>The photo is of an eastern fox squirrel, the largest North American 
arboreal squirrel, weighing as much as 2.2 pounds. This squirrel and the 
very similar eastern gray squirrel are large, aggressive and adaptable. 
Due to human introduction into non-native ranges in both North America 
and Europe, they threaten to drive all other arboreal squirrels to 
extinction.</p>
<p>Technically, Woodchucks and other marmots are oversize burrowing ground 
squirrels, but we'll treat them separately here. The smaller ground 
squirrels are not generally of culinary interest.</p>
<p>Squirrel was once significant in American cooking, particularly in the 
Southeast, but has fallen out of favor due to the inconvenience of 
shooting and dressing the squirrels - people just don't have time for that 
any more. &nbsp;  <a href="ar_squirz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b>

<p>These two Marmots have an overlapping range from Kazakhstan through 
southwest Siberia, Mongolia and northwestern China. They usually weigh 
between 9 and 14 pounds, but can weigh up to 18 pounds when nearing 
hibernation. There are other Marmots not listed here because I have no 
evidence of them being much eaten by people today, though the 
Yellow-bellied Marmot of the U.S. Northwest was probably eaten by 
Native Americans of the region in times past. Today, the Woodchuck is 
the only Marmot much eaten in North America.

Woodchucks are large Marmots that live from central Alaska, down through 
Minnesota, south to Arkansas and Georgia, and as far north as 
Newfoundland, but they avoid all the Western states. They prefer moist 
grassland near forests. They can grow to 31 pounds under ideal conditions, 
but are usually between 4 and 9 pounds.</p>
<p>Woodchucks are most often considered garden and farm pests, but are 
also considered good eating by many people living within their range,

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>The more popular culinary rabbits and rodents are low in fat and good 
sources of protein. Aquatic varieties may be a bit fattier.</p>
<p>Wild rodents sometimes carry diseases, but those grown commercially 
should not be a problem. Any wild rodents that are not strictly vegetarian 
should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165&deg;F/74&deg;C 
to avoid trichinosis and other diseases.</p>
<p>Rabies and Plague are possibilities with wild rodents, but not usually 
a major problem in North America. Here in Southern California, we do 
occassionally get warnings that some wild squirrels have been found 
with the Plague.</p>
