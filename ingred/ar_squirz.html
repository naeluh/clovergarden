[Fuzzy tailed tree rat; (family <i>Sciuridae</i>)]
<p>
Squirrels are divided into tree living (arboreal) and burrowing ground 
squirrel categories. Some of the arboreal varieties are known as 
"flying squirrels" because they've developed large flaps of skin that 
allow them to glide from tree to tree. Flying squirrels are too small to 
be of culinary interest.</p>
<p>The photo is of an eastern fox squirrel, the largest North American 
arboreal squirrel, weighing as much as 2.2 pounds. This squirrel and the 
very similar eastern gray squirrel are large, aggressive and adaptable. 
Due to human introduction into non-native ranges in both North America 
and Europe, they threaten to drive all other arboreal squirrels to 
extinction.</p>
<p>Technically, Woodchucks and other marmots are oversize burrowing 
ground squirrels, but we'll treat them separately here. The smaller 
ground squirrels are not generally of culinary interest.</p>
<p>Squirrel was once significant in American cooking, particularly in the 
Southeast, but has fallen out of favor due to the inconvenience of 
catching, killing and dressing squirrels in our increasingly urbanized 
environment.

<p>Squirrel is the correct meat for an authentic Brunswick stew, but 
today people resort to using chicken. The inconvenient truth is, <b>we 
need to eat more squirrels</b>. They are woefully deficient in natural 
predators and are completely out of control. Dogs are too slow, cats just 
don't care, hawks will ignore them all day in hopes of getting a pigeon, 
and owls, weasels and arboreal snakes are still avoiding urban areas.</p>

<p>The fox squirrels (<i>Sciurus niger</i>) plaguing our urban forests 
here in California are not native but were brought from the East Coast 
and released by some total moron. These squirrels are highly destructive 
to fruit and nut crops and to our homes. A single squirrel can strip a 
whole fruit tree in a couple days. They pick a not quite ripe fruit, 
take one  bite, throw the fruit away and pick another. 80% of what they 
take is wasted.</p>

<p>They are also noted for raiding bird feeders and digging up flower 
bulbs and eating them. If there is even the smallest opening they get 
into attics to build nests and pee. If there isn't an opening they'll 
try to gnaw their way in, destroying siding and other woodwork.</p>

<p>Despite questionable legality, many homeowners around here have 
resorted to high power pellet rifles with telescopic sights. These 
probably account for hundreds of squirrels every year, but there are 
always more,</p>

<p>Of course you could set traps, but squirrels are clever and hard to 
trap - and then what do you do with them? It's illegal to release these 
alien squirrels anywhere in California. The most reasonable solution is 
to kill them, dress them and cook them. Unfortunately few in our urban 
environment are up to doing this.</p>

<p>I confess I haven't done it myself, yet, but it's definitely on my 
list of things to do, as is making an authentic Brunswick stew. I need 
to set up an outdoors cutting board.</p>

<p>Squirrels are the primary carriers of plague in Southern California 
(and practically everywhere else).</p>
<p>Squirrels may not be strictly vegetarian, so they should be cooked well 
to avoid the possibility of trichinosis. In Russia a pack of squirrels was 
seen to kill a dog and eat it.
