[Whistlepig, Pasture pig; Wuchak (Algonquian); <i>Marmota monax</i>]
<p>
Woodchucks live from central Alaska, down through Minnesota, south 
to Arkansas and Georgia, and as far north as Newfoundland, but they avoid 
all the Western states. They prefer moist grassland near forests. They 
can grow to 31 pounds under ideal conditions, but are usually between 4 
and 9 pounds.</p>
<p>Having a taste for garden vegetation and agricultural crops, they are 
considered major pests. Woodchucks also dig large multi-tunneled burrows 
which can drain ponds, undermine foundations, cause injury to farm 
animals and damage equipment.</p>
<p>Woodchucks are also considered good eating by many people living 
within their range, but they are not farmed (too wild in temperament). 
They are almost completely vegetarian but have been observed to eat some 
insects and snails. This does not present a trichinosis problem. It is 
very rare for Woodchucks to carry Plague, but Rabies is a little more 
common.

Woodchuck meat is dark but mild and tender, as it is a small vegetarian. 
Recipes are similar to those for rabbit or squirrel.

<p><b>Hunting / Trapping:</b> &nbsp; In areas of sustained harvest, 
woodchucks should not be hunted or trapped until mid to late summer, 
because the young would die should their mother be killed before they 
are mature. Woodchucks hibernate during the winter but emerge from early 
February to early April depending on latitude and weather. They may be 
trapped (they like green beans and cut apples) or hunted, but hunting is 
a lot harder.</p>
<p><b>Preparing:</b> &nbsp; Woodchuck is gutted as soon as killed and 
the blood drained, It is then chilled until skinned and dressed. Some 
instructions call for hanging the animal in a very cool place for 48 
hours before skinning and dressing, but most don't. Hanging, an old 
tenderizing method, seems to have gone out of style.
<br><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Small grey 
or reddish scent glands, looking like small blobs of fat, should be 
carefully removed without breaking. They are found under the forelegs, 
above the shoulder blades, along the backbone in the small of the back 
and around the anus. Remove and discard all fat, then cut the carcass 
into the size chunks you want for cooking or freezing. The hide is tough 
and some people process it into durable leather.</p>
<p><b>Cooking</b> &nbsp; Woodchuck is usually made into stew or stew 
filled pies. Old woodchucks (worn teeth and claws) should be parboiled 
before cooking. Some people soak the meat in salt brine for an hour or 
more before cooking. Simmer on the bone for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, depending 
on age, then add vegetables and simmer another 1/2 hour or so. Remove 
the meat from the bones, which are discarded. Strain the broth and 
finish the stew like any other meat stew.</p>
