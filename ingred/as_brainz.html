<h1>Lamb Brain</h1>

Lamb brains are eaten in most lamb growing regions, but have not been 
easy to find here in Southern California (which is not much of a lamb 
growing region). In Autumn 2013 I did find some, imported from 
Australia, packaged in individual plastic bags arranged six to a foam 
tray. Typically, they were 3 inches wide by 3-1/2 inches long and 
weighed 3-1/4 ounces each. Cost was US 2013 $5.99 / pound.

<p>Brains are very high in cholesterol. That's pretty much what brains 
are made out of, but there are other concerns. Scrapie, the sheep and 
goat version of mad cow disease, is not currently thought to transmit 
to humans, but there is considerable concern that it could morph 
into a version that can. In Europe, even heads of mature sheep that 
have had their brains removed are illegal due to this concern. Heads 
of lambs may be sold if the brain and spinal cord have been carefully 
removed. Fortunately, scrapie has been pretty much eliminated from 
Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Some people (mostly not in North America) just dote over brains. I'm 
not one of those, and kind of wonder about those who do. I haven't 
liked the brains of any critter I've tried, either for taste or texture, 
but these were particularly bad. Cooked for just a short time they had 
almost the consistency of mush, and rather than being bland they had a 
distinctly unpleasant taste - and an unpleasant aftertaste that lingered.
</p>

<p>After tasting one, I decided not to do any recipes for Lamb Brains -  
the zombies are welcome to them. Consequently, I don't have much detail 
- there are limits to just how far I'll go in the cause of science. I 
can report, though, that cooked they yield about 73% of their uncooked 
weight.</p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Sweetbreads (thymus and pancreas) are considered 
superior substitutes for brains (and I can testify to that for beef). 
While lamb sweetbreads are very popular in Latin America and Turkey, 
I have not seen them here in Southern California, but beef sweetbreads 
are fairly available - if you know where to look.<p></p>
