<h1>Lamb Feet</h1>
<br><img src="img/as_feet01g.jpg" alt="Three whole Lamb Feet" class=mrg>
   Lamb feet are used mainly to add substance to soups and stews. They appear 
   in recipes from regions where cows can't be economically raised and pigs 
   are forbidden (or way too expensive to raise). The photo specimens, from 
   New Zealand, were 6-1/2 inches long and weighed 4.9 ounces each.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in markets serving communities 
from countries that use a lot of lamb: Turkey, Armenia, Middle East, North 
Africa, Pakistan, and the like. Some stores do not place the feet on 
display but you can ask for them at the counter.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Feet sold here in California are completely cleaned, 
all wool removed, parboiled and with the outer hoof removed. For best 
results you want to split the lamb feet lengthwise to expose the tendons 
and the bone marrow. To do this take set a foot on the cutting board, hoof 
towards you. Carefully position your razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife at 
the cleft and drive it through with your soft faced mallet. The bone 
will split nicely.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;.As with calf feet, the main reason to cook 
lamb feet is to add body to soups and stews. They are interchangeable 
with calve's feet on a same weight basis, but are not interchangeable 
with pig feet which are quite different.
<p>Split and put in the broth for the recipe. Simmer for about 1-1/2 hours. 
The meat can be removed from the bones, cut up and returned to the 
recipe. If the meat will not be used you can simmer considerably longer.</p>
