<p>Lamb heads are a prized delicacy in the cuisines of North Africa, the 
Middle East, Turkey, Armenia and the Stans. American military officers 
in Iraq, who've asked for a "real authentic Iraqi dinner" have regretted  
their request as dinner stared back at them at the table - while the 
Iraqis beam with pride at the fine fare they have provided. Lamb head 
is also quite popular in Norway and Iceland.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Because of our large and very diverse ethnic 
populations here in Southern California, the big multi-ethnic markets 
often have Lamb Head, plastic wrapped on foam trays. Here it is always 
half heads, the whole head for properly staring at the guests needs to 
be ordered special. It will still be cut in half, but able to be bound 
together. The photo specimen was 10 inches long and 6 inches wide, 
weighing 1 pound 10-3/4 ounces. It was purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2019 US $2.29 / 
pound.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; In primitive circumstances, the head may be 
charred over a charcoal fire to burn off hair and make it possible to 
rub off the skin. Note that in some regions, such as Norway, the hair 
is singed off but the skin is left on. Around here, the heads are sold 
skinned and ready to go. In all cases, the head is sawed in half 
lengthwise, though it may be tied back together for or after roasting. 
Here in Southern California we will usually be dealing with half heads 
that don't match.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; There are a number of ways in which Lamb Head 
is cooked. The brain is always removed and cooked separately.

<ul>
<li><b>Steaming:</b> &nbsp; The head is washed and placed on a steamer 
rack and steamed for about 3-1/2 hours. Depending on the steamer, it 
may have to be cut into chunks - use a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
by a soft faced mallet. We have a complete recipe for this method, 
<a href="../recipes/mam_lmbhd1.html"><b>Lamb Head, Steamed</b></a>.
<p></p></li>

<li><b>Roasting:</b> &nbsp; The head should be placed in a pot of 
salted water to cover and brought to a boil for about 5 minutes or so.  
Dump it in a clean skink and rinse well. The tongue is usually simmered 
another 20 minutes and its skin peeled, then returned to the head. The 
head is massaged with a mix of oil, garlic and herbs. Arranged on a 
pan, it is slipped into the oven, perhaps starting at 425&deg;F/220&deg;C 
for 20 minutes, then turning down to 325&deg;F/190&deg;C for another 
hour, basting frequently. Some recipes finish half heads in the broiler 
for more browning.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Boiling:</b> &nbsp; This is essentially the same as steaming but 
it's best to do the par boil and rinse per the Roasting method first, 
especially if the broth will be used. It will need to be boiled for 2 
to 3 hours. Onions and root vegetables can be added to the water with 
appropriate timing. Boiling is popular in Scotland, Khazakstan and other 
regions. In Iceland, the head is pulled a bit earlier. All the meat is 
pulled from the bones and returned to the pot with the vegetables.</li> 
</ul>
