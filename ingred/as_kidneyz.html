<p>
Lamb kidneys are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
significant item in the diet. They are similar in size, shape and taste 
and are generally interchangeable with pig kidneys (unless you're a 
Muslim or observant Jew). The photo specimens were 3-3/4 inches long and 
weighed 3-3/4 ounces each.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in markets serving communities 
from countries that use a lot of lamb: Turkey, Armenia, Middle East, North 
Africa, Pakistan, etc. They should not have a strong odor.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Split kidneys lengthwise as shown in photo above. 
Cut out the white fat and any attached plumbing.<p></p>
