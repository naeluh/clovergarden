Here in Southern California,  Mutton is often cut into chunks, similar 
to how Goat is often cut, but into larger chunks. Most of the Mutton 
available here is imported frozen from Australia or New Zealand. The 
photo specimens were about 50% bone, but quite low in fat.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Mutton is not common here in Southern 
California, but can be found in some of the ethnic markets, 
particularly those serving a Philippine community. The photo 
specimens were found in a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
for 2016 US $2.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These chunks can be roasted whole and used 
to make soup stock. I usually cut away the meat for other uses (a little 
tedious) and roast the bones for about 30 minutes in a preheated 
475&deg;F/245&deg;C oven. I then simmer the bones for stock. Note: all 
the fat goes in the stock pot because some of the desirable flavors from 
the fat are water soluble. When the stock is done, the fat is removed 
using your gravy separator.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; These chunks usually average out around 50% 
removable meat and 50% bones, membranes and fat.<p></p>
