Lamb Necks are useful for stews and the like. The meat is fairly dark and 
flavorful, and there is little fat.  The photo specimens were 
4 inches long, 2-1/2 inches high and 3 inches across and weighed 1 pound 
each. Each of these chunks contained two neck bones.
<p>Keep in mind, if using an English recipe that uses the traditional 
English lamb cuts "neck" means something quite different. See the 
<a href="as_sheepcc.html#brit">English Lamb Chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in markets serving communities 
from countries that use a lot of lamb: Turkey, Armenia, Middle East, North 
Africa, Pakistan, etc.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Neck meat is well exercised so it's both 
flavorful and tough. Given the complexity of the bones the practical 
method for recovering this meat is to simmer for two hours, after which 
it can be easily removed from the bones with a fork.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A one pound neck piece (two bones) will yield 
about 10 ounces of meat (63%). Of course to fully recover this meat, the 
neck pieces need to be simmered about 2 hours so the meat can be pulled 
off cleanly. After simmering the cooked meat will weigh abotut 5-1/2 
ounces (34%).<p></p>
