[Lamb Fries, Sheep Nuts; Testiculos de Borrego (Spanish)]
<p>
  Lamb Testicles are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
  significant item in the diet. They're pretty good eating, but 
  unfortunately   they are a bit scarce in North America. Here most male 
  sheep are castrated immediately after birth and their testicles are not 
  yet developed. Allowed to develop to maturity they're of pretty 
  impressive size.</p>
  <p>The photo specimens were procured from a large multi-ethnic market 
  in Los Angeles, just under 1-1/2 pounds packed in a foam tray of 5. The 
  largest was 3-1/2 inches long, 2-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 5-7/8 
  ounces. The smallest was 3-1/4 inches long, 2 inches diameter and 
  weighed 3-5/8 ounces.</p>

<p>Raw sheep testicles feel like little balloons filled with jelly. Cooked 
they are tender, mild, and do not have any sheep meat taste or aroma. They 
have been compared to bratwurst.</p>

<p>They are always skinned and most often sliced and fried coated in a light 
batter. Around Lebanon they are cut smaller, fried without batter and served 
with parsley, lemon juice and/or sumac.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Lamb testicles are not easy to find in North 
America, but are most often found packed in trays of 4 to 6 in markets 
serving a heavily Middle Eastern community. They can be ordered from a 
specialty butcher, but you may have to buy a whole box. In Australia, 
New Zealand and the Balkans these are normal fare and more easily 
available.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep well refrigerated until used. Like other 
organ meats they degrade rapidly and should be cooked within a day or so 
from purchase.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Rinse. Cut just a little off each end, run a knife, 
sharp edge out, lengthwise just under the skin. Peel the skin off. This is 
the hard part because the skin is <u>very</u> tough and what you're 
peeling it off of is rather tender. They may then be sliced according to 
the recipe. An alternative method is to slice them in half lengthwise 
before peeling.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Sheep nuts cook very quickly if sliced. The are 
most often fried and just a couple minutes in hot oil will do it.<p></p>
