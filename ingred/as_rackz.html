<h1>Lamb Rack</h1>

This cut is most often roasted whole. The feather bones above the 
backbone (chine bone) are usually sawed off by the butcher. The chine 
bone itself is carefully removed with a boning knife so as to not 
damage the meat above it.  The chops are easily cut separate from each 
other after the rack is roasted. 

<p>The tails of the chops may be "Frenched", which means trimmed so the 
rib bones are completely exposed without meat, fat or membranes for 
an inch to 2 inches from the tips. They must be scraped completely 
clean or they will burn. Frenching is not at all necessary, it's just 
a style.</p>

<p>All the materials removed during trimming are used for soups and 
stocks. The fat can also proved flavor and included (if you have no 
other use for it). The stock can be de-fatted easily using your 
gravy separator.</p>

<p>Two or three racks can be bound into a circle to form a "Crown Roast". 
The racks are turned meaty side in, and a stuffing may be placed in the 
center. For this use the racks are always Frenched. Doing this prep is 
not easy, so most people just buy it already formed, stuffed and ready 
to roast - for 2019 US $130 to $150 plus one-day shipping.

<p>The photo specimen was 12-1/2 inches long, 8 inches wide and weighted 
2-1/2 pounds.

This photo shows Lamb Chops cut from the rack pictured above. They are 
easily cut apart once the backbone (chine bone) has been carefully cut 
away. The one to the far right has been "Frenched".
