Lamb shanks are popular in all lamb eating cultures. The meat is flavorful 
and there's plenty of connective tissue to make for good soups. The photo 
specimens were 7 inches long, 2-1/2 inches wide and 1-3/4 inches thick at 
the big end. They weighed 11-1/2 ounces each.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in markets serving communities 
from countries that use a lot of lamb: Turkey, Armenia, Middle East, North 
Africa, Pakistan, etc.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  This depends on the recipe. Some recipes call for 
the meat to be removed from the bones. The meat is actually quite easy to 
remove from the bone. The outer membrane and fat are much easier to remove 
from the meat after it has been removed from the bone.
<p>While often not part of the recipe, 
the bones should be browned well in the oven and used to make lamb stock 
(see <a href="../recipes/tim_lambstock1.html"><b>Recipe</b></a>).</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; One pound of shanks will yield 7.8 ounces of 
uncooked meat (49%).<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Shank meat is well exercised and there's a lot of 
tough connective tissue, so long wet cooking is in order, at least 1/2 hour 
off the bone or 1 hour on the bone.<p></p>
