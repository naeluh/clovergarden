<h1>Sheep / Lamb</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>Domesticated sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) have been 
raised for meat, milk, and wool for around 12,000 years. In countries 
where grazing land is scarce, too hilly and too scrubby for cattle, 
sheep and goats are the most economical meats, and lamb has become 
deeply embedded in the culture of peoples from those regions.</span>

<h2 id="#gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Sheep and goats were probably the first animals to be domesticated, 
about 12,000 years ago. Their small size and tendency to flock made it 
possible to fence them in and conduct a selective breeding program to 
reduce wild traits. Originally sheep were raised for meat, milk and 
skins, but around 8000 years ago they began to be breed for wool.</p>

<p>Lamb consumption in the United States is rather low, averaging around 
1 pound per person per year. Some Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups 
eat lamb at certain holidays. Most is purchased by Muslims, followed by 
Greeks, Jews and Hispanics, nearly all on the East and West coasts.	 Lamb, 
as sold, is expensive here, and by time you remove the bones and all that 
fat, it is quite expensive.</p>
 
<p>In the United States, three sheep designations are used.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; A sheep one year old or less. Inspectors 
  determine age in live sheep from the teeth, In carcasses by the joints 
  in the front shank and the ribs. Lamb accounts for most of the sheep 
  meat sold in the US.</li>
<li><h3>Yearling Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; A sheep older than one year and 
  younger than two years. This is roughly equivalent to the term 
  <b>Hogget</b> used in Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.</li>
<li><h3>Mutton:</h3> &nbsp; A sheep older than two years. Mutton is very 
  rare in the US, but can be found in some ethnic markets, particularly 
  those serving a Philippine community. Mutton has a stronger taste than 
  lamb. Most mutton is shipped here from New Zealand and Australia.</li> 
</ul>
<p>The USDA grades quality of lamb meat on a scale depending on 
palatability. The grades are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Prime:</h3> &nbsp; This meat from fatter sheep accounts for less 
  than 10% of US production.</li>
<li><h3>Choice:</h3> &nbsp; This grade accounts for about 90% of all 
  US lamb production.</li>
<li><h3>Good <small>&amp;</small> Utility:</h3> &nbsp; These lower 
  grades are very rare in US lamb production.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="who" class=lrg>Who Eat's Sheep <small>&amp;</small> Goat?</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Jews</h3> are free to eat lamb and goat provided it has been 
  ritually slaughtered. In the religion's land of origin, the Middle East, 
  lamb dominates because there is no lush grazing land for cattle, and pig 
  is forbidden, so lamb / mutton is important to Jewish culture worldwide.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Islam</h3> adopted much of it's dietary law from Judaism, and 
  is also predominantly a religion of less fertile regions. While beef 
  is not forbidden, it can't be economically raised in most Islamic 
  regions, so lamb / mutton is the meat of choice, and goat is allowed.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Southeast Asia:</h3> &nbsp; Muslim areas including the far south 
  of Thailand, most of Malaysia and Indonesia, favor lamb, but it's more 
  expensive in tropical climates, so buffalo is more popular. Non-Muslims 
  prefer pig, which is in good supply and much less costly.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>India:</h3> &nbsp; In areas of India that were under Muslim 
  occupation for some time, such as the Punjab and Hyderabad, lamb is 
  preferred, but goat is the most common meat in India. Recipes can 
  confuse you because during the Raj the British were pleased to call 
  goat "mutton" to make it taste better.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Christians</h3>, largely recruited from the Pagans, brought a 
  whole lot of Paganism with them. Rejecting the religious prohibitions 
  of Judaism they eat whatever is economical in the region where they 
  live. In the Middle East and other less fertile areas that will be 
  sheep and goat, but cow and pig are preferred where economical.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>North Americans</h3> are predominantly Christians, Pagans, 
  Atheists or "Mix and Match".  Lamb is not that popular here because 
  it's too expensive compared to cow and pig, and some don't like the 
  smell while it's cooking.
