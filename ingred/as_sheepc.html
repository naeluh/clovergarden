<h1>Lamb / Sheep Cuts <small>by</small> Chart</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
This chart shows U.S. Lamb Primal Cuts. Canada uses the same cuts 
but with names in both English and French.</span>. There are two 
different cut styles used in the U.S. - Style A (13th rib goes with loin, 
no surloin (next cut is leg)) and Style B (no rib goes with loin, surloin 
is cut from Style A leg).</p>
<p>Australia / New Zealand primal cuts are very close to U.S. Style-B, 
though subprime cuts are a little different. Traditional British cuts 
are quite different (Click on 
<a href="as_sheepcc.html#brit"><b>English Chart</b></a> for English 
cuts), but England seems to be shifting to the Australian system.  
See <a href="as_sheepc.html#links"><b>Links</b></a> for further details.

  the leg bone (left in photo). The photo specimen was 7 inches long, 5

Officially, this primal cut is both sides as a saddle, but in markets its  
generally sold by the side. To many Americans this is the most desirable 
part of the lamb - used in many of the fanciest classic lamb recipes. 
It's also very much the most expensive especially since there isn't all that 
much meat on it.

  This is a fairly meaty cut and sells at a higher price than some other lamb 
  cuts. The photo specimen, purchased at a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles, 
  conforms to neither Style A (13th rib only) or Style B (no rib) in having 
  ribs 11 12 and 13.  It was 11 inches by 6 inches and weighed 2.1 pounds. 
  Cut to Style A it would have been 1 pound 11 ounces, 9 inches by 6 inches. 
  The short loin part of the tenderlon can  be seen in the upper right.

  The loin may include 1 to 3 ribs which are not proper loin chops (the 
  photo shows two rib chops on the left). The loin chops are quite meaty, 
  containing only a thin T-shaped bone. Actually, they are mineature 
  T-Bone and Porterhouse steaks.

Leg of Lamb is prized everywhere lamb is eaten. It is highly popular in

  <img src="img/as_shank06c.jpg" alt="Lamb Shanks" class=mrg></a>
Lamb shanks are popular in all lamb eating cultures. The meat is flavorful 
and there's plenty of connective tissue to make good soups. The photo 
specimens were 7 inches long, 2-1/2 inches wide and 1-3/4 inches thick at 
the big end. They weighed 11-1/2 ounces each.

<tr><th id="other"><span class=bg>Other Cuts</span></th><td colspan=2>
While these unnumbered cuts are not normal to American supermarkets, they

are all easily available from ethnic markets.</td></tr>

  <td class=nw><br></td>
    <td><a href="as_headz.html">
  <img src="img/as_head05c.jpg" alt="Lamb Head" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb heads are a prized delacy in the cuisines of the Middle East, 
  Turkey, Armenia and the Stans. American military personnel in Iraq who've 
  asked for a "real authentic Iraqi dinner" generally regret their request 
  as dinner stares back at them while the Iraqis beam with pride at the fine 
  fare they have provided. Lamb head is also quite popular in Norway.

  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_neckz.html">
  <img src="img/as_neck01c.jpg" alt="Lamb Neck" class=mrg></a>
   Lamb Necks are useful for stews and the like. The meat is fairly dark and 
   flavorful, and there is little fat.  The photo specimens were 
   4 inches long, 2-1/2 inches high and 3 inches across and weighed 1 pound 
   each. Each of these chunks contained two neck bones.
   Keep in mind, if using an English recipe that uses the traditional 
   English lamb cuts, "neck" means something quite different. See the 
   <a href="as_sheepcc.html#brit">English Lamb Chart</a>.

  <td><a href="as_mchunkz.html">
  <img src="img/as_mutt02c.jpg" alt="Chunks of Mutton" class=mrg></a>
   Here in Southern California, Mutton is often cut into chunks, similar 
   to how Goat is often cut, but into larger chunks. Most mutton available 
   here is imported frozen from Australia or New Zealand. The photo 
   specimens were about 50% bone, but quite low in fat.
   </td></tr>

  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_feetz.html">
  <img src="img/as_feet01c.jpg" alt="Lamb Feet" class=mrg></a>
   Lamb feet are used mainly to add substance to soups and stews. They appear 
   in recipes from regions where cows can't be economically raised and pigs 
   are forbidden (or way too expensive to raise). The photo specimens, from 
   New Zealand, were 6-1/2 inches long and weighed 4.9 ounces each.
   </td></tr>
<tr><th  rowspan="1">Fat</th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/as_fatrump01c.jpg" alt="Live Fat Rump Sheep" class=mrg>
  In regions where people adhere to a religion that forbids lard, the 
  best they can do is sheep fat. For this purpose special breeds of 
  sheep are raised that store large amounts of fat in their tails and/or 
  rumps. This fat is considered of much higher quality than that found 
  on other parts of a sheep. This fat is very important for frying and 
  inclusion in recipes in the Middle East, Pakistan and Central Asia. 
  These breeds are not raised on a commercial scale in North America, 
  so here we must use fat from other parts of the sheep.

<tr><th id="inn"><span class=bg>Innards</span></th><td colspan="2">
In traditional agricultural regions, all edible parts of an animal are eaten, 
including internal organs. These are different in taste and texture from 
muscle meats and some are highly prized and expensive. Most Americans, 
however, are unfamiliar with them and how they are used, so innards tend 
to be rather economical here.</td></tr>

  <td><a href="as_tongz.html">
  <img src="img/as_tongue01c.jpg" alt="Whole Lamb Tongues" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb tongues are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
  significant item in the diet. They are sometimes pickled. The photo 
  specimens, packed in a tray of 6, were 5 inches long and weighed 2.7 ounces 
  each.</td></tr>

  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_kidneyz.html">
  <img src="img/as_kidney07c.jpg" alt="Lamb Kidneys" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb kidneys are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
  significant item in the diet. They are similar in size, shape and taste, 
  and are generally interchangeable with pig kidneys (unless you're a 
  Muslim or observant Jew).  The photo specimens were 3-3/4 inches long 
  and weighed 3-3/4 ounces each.</td></tr>

  <img src="img/as_liver05c.jpg" alt="Lamb Liver" class=mrg></a>
  As with the livers of other meat animals, lamb liver is usually cooked 
  with onions. The photo specimen was 0.7 pound, 7 x 5 x 7/8 inches.</td>

  <img src="img/as_heart02c.jpg" alt="Lamb Hearts" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb hearts are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
  significant item in the diet. The meat is dark and tough, so needs long 
  cooking (4 hrs simmering). The photo specimens were 4-1/4 x 3 x 2 
  inches and wighed 10-3/4 ounces, a significant part of which is hard 
  fat. Pig hearts are larger, cheaper and much less fatty, but forbidden 
  by Islam and Judaism.</td></tr>

  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_spleenz.html">
  <img src="img/as_spleen02c.jpg" alt="Lamb Spleen" class=mrg></a>
  These are usually labeled "Lamb Melts" in the markets to avoid the 
  rather anatomical "Spleen". It is most used in North African cooking, 
  but also anywhere sheep and goat are feature meats. The larger of the 
  two photo specimens (front and back) was 6-1/2 inches long, 4 inches 
  wide and 1 inch thick, weighing 5-1/2 ounces.
.</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="1">Lungs<small><br>(Lights)</small></th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td>Lungs are called for in some recipes, most notabley for Scottish Haggis, 
  as well as some recipes originating from the Middle East, "The Stans" and 
  North Africa. It is, however, illegal to sell lungs in the U.S. so they 
  must be done without, unless you slaughter your own lamb.</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="1"><a href="as_tripez.html">Tripe</a></th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_tripez.html">
  <img src="img/as_tripe02c.jpg" alt="Lamb Tripe" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb tripe is much thinner than beef but may take as long to cook depending 
  on desired texture. The photo specimen was about 13 inches by 10 inches and 
  weighed 1 pound, but they may be up to about 1-1/2 pounds.
  </td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="1"><a href="as_brainz.html">Brains</a></th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td><a href="as_brainz.html">
  <img src="img/as_brain03c.jpg" alt="Whole Lamb Brain" class=mrg></a>
  Lamb brains are eaten in most lamb growing regions, but have not 
  been easy to find here in Southern California (which is not much of a 
  lamb growing region). In Autumn 2013 I did find some, imported from 
  Australia, packaged in individual plastic bags arranged six to a foam 
  tray. Typically, they were 3 inches wide by 3-1/2 inches long and 
  weighed 3-1/4 ounces each.
  <b>subst:</b> Sweetbreads are considered a superior substitute.</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="1">Sweetbreads</th>
  <td class=nw><br></td>
  <td>Lamb sweetbreads are particularly popular in Latin America and Turkey. 
  There are two types, usually served together. Throat Sweetbreads (thymus) 
  are  cylindrical in shape while the Heart Sweetbreads (pancreas) are 
  roughly spherical. I have yet to see them here in Southern California 
  where even cow sweetbreads are not common.</td></tr>

  Lamb testicles are well regarded by non-squemish eaters. they are 
  generally shipped frozen from Australia or New Zealand. The photo 
  specimens were purchased from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles, 
  (Altadena) just under 1-1/2 pounds packed in a foam tray of 5. The 
  largest was 3-1/2 inches long, 2-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 5-7/8 
  ounces. The smallest was 3-1/4 inches long, 2 inches diameter and 
  weighed 3-5/8 ounces.</td></tr>
