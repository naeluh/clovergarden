God has reserved pigs for the Pagans (Pagans senso lato includes 
Christians). Jews and Muslims must get along with just sheep, goats and 
cattle, passing over the vast array of delicious pork products for the 
few that can be made from these animals.</span> &nbsp;

<h2>Lamb Sausage - Moroccan</h2>
<br><img src="img/sg_lambm01e.jpg" alt="Moroccan Lamb Sausage" class=mrg>
The photo specimens, obtained fresh from a Whole Foods Market, were 7 
inches long, 1 inch in diameter and weighed 3 ounces. Lamb, spices 
(black pepper, cumin, coriander), sea salt, citric acid, natural lemon 
flavor, canola oil, and natural lamb casings. This formulation is 
fine for the flavor of North African recipes, but doesn't assure 
kosher / halal if the animals have not been slaughtered and prepared 
in accordance with religious rituals.
<p>This is a rather spicy sausage, though the "hot" aspect comes from 
black pepper rather than chilis. The cumin and coriander are fairly 
assertive as well. In cooking it exudes quite a bit of both oil and 
water, so for browning you want to use a fairly high heat (and there 
will be a lot of splattering). Grilling over hot coals will get better 
browning than frying, but frying works fine too. The overall effect 
is significantly drier than a pork sausage but moist enough to be 
enjoyable, and of course the flavor is different.
