<h1>Lamb Spleen / Goat Spleen</h1>

These are usually labeled "Lamb Melts" in the markets to avoid the 
rather anatomical "Spleen". It is most used in North African cooking, 
but also anywhere sheep and goat are featured meats. The larger of the 
two photo specimens of was 6-1/2 inches long, 4 inches wide and 1 inch 
thick, weighing 5-1/2 ounces. The smaller in the photo shows the flat 
back side.<p>
<p>Goat Spleen, popular in India, is pretty much identical in 
appearance and cooking properties, but not much available in 
North America.</p>

<p>Spleens are most commonly combined with kidneys, livers, lungs and 
other sheep innards in recipes, but in Morocco they are often split open 
and stuffed. In flavor it's similar to liver but milder, but its texture 
is is chewy rather than soft and crumbly like liver.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found labled "Lamb Melts" in markets 
serving Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and North African, and any other 
communites that are big on sheep and goat.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for peeling away the skin and 
tendons, but spleens sold in markets here are cleaned and ready to go. 
Their may be a small amount of fat to cut away. There is an outer 
membrane, which is a little annoying, but removing it is rather difficult 
to do. Because of the soft texture, it is best to place the spleens 
into the freezer compartment until stiff to make them easier to slice 
evenly. T can take 1-1/2 hours or more.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Like Squid. Spleen must be cooked a very shorth 
time, or a rather long time. For stir frying, cut fairly thin and fry 
the minimum time to cook through, less than 10 minutes. If wet cooked, 
at 10 minutes they have the texture of a very soft, springy rubber and 
cannot be chewed. At 1-1/4 hour they're still a little chewy, but quite 
edible.<p></p>

<h3>Recipes:</h3> &nbsp; If you search for recipes on the Internet, search 
for "Lamb Spleen". "Lamb Melts" will get you only hundreds of descriptions 
of dishes where "the lamb melts in your mouth" and no recipes for spleen.
<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Spleens are very 
high in dietary iron and promote red blood cells, but is a problem 
for a few poeple who have a condition called hemochromatosis. <p></p>
