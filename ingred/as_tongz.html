[Lengua de Borrego (Spanish)]
<p>
Lamb tongues are eaten by pretty much every culture where lamb is a 
significant item in the diet. They are sometimes pickled. As with the 
tongues of other ungulates, they are quite fatty.</p>
<p>The photo specimens, packed in a tray of 6, were 5 inches long and 
weighed 2.7 ounces each. I have purchased New Zealand lamb tongues that 
were 7 inches long and weighed 5.7 ounces, but they were cut farther 
back and included small bone and some fat and glandular material at 
the root end.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Lamb tongues are most often found packed in trays 
of 4 to 6 in markets serving Middle Eastern, Armenian, Turkish or other 
lamb focused communities. As with all parts of lamb in North America, 
they are expensive, but you can use less expensive pig tongues instead, 
unless you are a Muslim or observant Jew.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For best results, and for broth that can be used 
in recipes, follow this method:
<ol>
<li>Wash the tongue and cut away any fat, lymph nodes or other stuff hanging 
  onto the bottom and root end. If there are bones, you can leave them in 
  for now.</li>
<li>Soak in cold water for 4 hours (if you have time).</li>
<li>Put in a pot with cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer 15 minutes</li>
<li>Clean the pot, refill with cold water and 1/2 tablespoon of 
  <b>Lemon Juice</b>. Put the tongues back in and bring 
  to a boil. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Take off heat and let cool until you can handle the tongues. Pull them 
  out and peel off the skins (this is much more difficult when the tongues 
  are cold). Return them to the broth to finish cooling.</li>
<li>Many recipes call for a good chill in the refrigerator, after which 
  the tongues will slice neatly and fat can be easily skimmed or strained from 
  the broth. The broth is used in many recipes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Raw yield is very good, 85% to 90% depending on how 
the tongues were cut. They will, however, shrink quite a bit in cooking. 
A 1 pound 7 ounce raw batch of tongues yielded 12-1/2 ounces trimmed cooked 
and peeled, but that's still 54% which is pretty good considering cooking 
shrinkage for most meats.<p></p>
