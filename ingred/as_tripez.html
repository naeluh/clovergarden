[Lamb Stomach]
<p>
This is the lining of the lamb's stomach. It is similar to beef tripe 
but there's only one kind and it's a lot thinner. It does not, however, 
take any less time to cook, in fact it seems to take more. The photo 
specimen was about 16 inches by 14 inches and weighed 1-1/2 pounds.</p>

<p>Lamb tripe straight from the lamb is dark olive green, crusty and needs 
a lot of scraping and cleaning, just like tripe from a cow. The lamb tripe 
sold in California is already factory cleaned and pretty much ready to go, 
but is generally not bleached as white as cow tripe is.</p>

<p>Incidentally, natural unscraped green tripe from lambs and cows is a 
common ingredient in upscale dog foods, and that's the way the dogs like 
it, but people prefer it well scraped and cleaned with all the green gone.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Lamb Tripe is to be found in markets serving a 
Middle Eastern, Persian, Pakastani, Armenian, Turkish, North African or 
other lamb focused community. It will generally be packaged one piece to 
a foam tray.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For best results, follow this method:
<ol>
<li>Wash the tripe and pick off any remaining fat and fiber, generally from 
  the folds. </li>
<li>Soak in cold water acidulated with lemon juice or citric acid for an 
  hour or so.</li>
<li>Put tripe in a pot with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer 20 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Clean the pot,</li>
<li>If the tripe is going into a long cooking recipe it can go in at this 
  point. If it must be fully cooked first, then refill the pot with cold 
  water, put in the tripe (it can be cut at this point) 
  and cook until done - another 3 to 5 hours.</li>
</ol>
