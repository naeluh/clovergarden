<p>
I knew you were just dying to see these lovely worms in clear aspic, 
so, here they are, with sauce and a condiment of shredded carrot and 
radish.</p>

<p>These burrowing worms are found in sandy subtidal environments and 
seabeds as deep as 3000 feet.  As unsegmented worms, they have 
traditionally been placed in its own phylum, <i>Sipuncula</i>, but 
evidence is accumulating that they are a subgroup of the annelid 
(segmented) worms. This worm can grow to 10 inches long, but is more 
commonly around 6 inches.</p>

<p>These worms are used as food particularly in the Guangdong, Hainan, 
Guangxi, and Fujian provinces of southern China. They are cleaned of 
their innards and cooked in various ways. In Fujian province they are 
cut into 2 inch segments, embedded in small cakes of clear aspic jelly, 
and served with a sauce.
