<p>That's right - not even worms can escape the voracious appetite of 
the Human species. Many insect larva are called "worms" in culinary 
circles, but they are not at all related to true worms. Of the true 
worms, fairly large marine species predominate on the plate.

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Annelid worms (phylum <i>Annelida</i>) are very ancient, but having 
no hard parts, fossil evidence is sparse. They are, however, well 
represented in the Burgess Shale of 550 million years ago from the mid 
Cambrian period. They have probably been around since the Precambrium or 
soon after, but we have to await additional evidence to say for sure.</p>
<p>Eating worms was certainly very important to our early vertebrate 
ancestors, but declined when they crawled out onto the land, where 
insects were much more plentiful. In more recent times, as Humans 
learned to harvest seafood, some worms have returned to the table, 
particularly in East Asia.</p>


<h2>Spoon Worm</h2>

(Japan); Haich&aacute;ng (China); <i>Urechis unicinctus</i>]
<p>
These sea worms dig "U" shaped tunnels in sand or mud. Often other 
animals take up residence in the tunnels, thus the "innkeeper" name.	 
They were traditionally held as a separate phylum of worms, having no 
segments, but are now held to be a subgroup of the annelid (segmented) 
worms. Young larvae are segmented, but lose that characteristic as adults. 
This is not the species where the tiny male lives its entire adult life 
within the female's uterus.</p>

<p>In Korea and Japan, these worms are usually eaten raw, with sesame 
oil and salt. Not surprisingly, a Korean company has applied for a U.S. 
Patent for producing an extract of this worm as a treatment for erectile 
disfunction. In China, they are often sliced up and stir fried with 
vegetables. They are also dried and ground to be used to add meaty flavor 
to dishes. They are particularly popular in Shandong, a north coast 
provence of China, just across the Yellow Sea from Korea, and are used 
in many recipes there.

<h2>Peanut Worm</h2>

[Beihai shachong, Tusan (China); <i>Sipunculus nudus</i>]
<p>
These burrowing worms are found in sandy subtidal environments and seabeds 
as deep as 3000 feet.  As unsegmented worms, they have traditionally been 
placed in its own phylum, <i>Sipuncula</i>, but evidence is accumulating 
that they are a subgroup of the annelid (segmented) worms. This worm 
can grow to 10 inches long, but is more commonly around 6 inches.</p>

<p>These worms are used as food particularly in the Guangdong, Hainan, 
Guangxi, and Fujian provinces of southern China. They are cleaned of 
their innards and cooked in various ways. In Fujian province they are 
cut into 2 inch segments, embedded in small cakes of clear aspic jelly, 
and served with a sauce. &nbsp; <a href="aw_sipunz.html"><b>Details and
