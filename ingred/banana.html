<p>The photo shows the bottom end of a maturing bunch of bananas growing 
in Spain's Canary Islands. All the female flowers have developed into 
bananas, but the male inflorescence is still opening, layer by layer, to 
expose rows of male flowers. Commercial bananas are sterile so don't need 
the male inflorescence, which is often removed and sold as a separate 
product.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Bananas were one of the earliest agricultural crops, starting about 
10,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. Taken from there to Africa and from 
Africa to Central and South America, it is now an important crop 
throughout the tropical areas of the world. The name "banana" is African.
</p>

<p>Bananas are the world's most popular fruit. Even in the 
U.S. where bananas are not grown, the average person, in a year, eats 10 
pounds more bananas than apples. Bananas are currently the 4th most 
important source of nutrition for the world's population, following only 
rice, wheat and corn.</p>

<p>Scientific naming of bananas has been highly confusing because the 
scientists have been highly confused. The former species name <i>Musca 
paradisiaca</i> was particularly confused and has been abandoned. For 
clarity, a letter code has been instituted (see below).</p>

<p>Developing new varieties of banana is very frustrating, especially 
since all the successful commercial varieties are sterile. In fact, the 
frustration of endless failures drove one prominent developer to suicide.
</p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg id="buy">Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Bananas</h2>

<p>Bananas are generally sold slightly unripe, which is fine because they 
are more durable that way and ripen well at room temperature. Avoid 
bruised fruit and bananas that are all green - they may not ripen well 
- cooking bananas like <a href="banana.html#plant">plantains</a> are the exception.
Different recipes will call for them all green through yellow to black.
</p>

<p>Do not refrigerate bananas or expose them to extreme temperatures or 
they will not ripen properly. When ripe, they can be refrigerated for a 
couple days to prevent them from becoming mushy. The skins turn brown 
when refrigerated but this does not affect the flesh.<p>

<p>Store bananas away from other fruits unless you want those fruit to 
ripen more quickly. Bananas exude a lot of ethylene gas which causes 
fruit to ripen.</p>

<br>

banana", A group), <i>Musa balbisiana</i> ("humble banana", B group)]
<p>
Wild bananas are not sterile like commercial bananas so are filled with 
hard seeds about 1/4 inch diameter. These are now uncommon even in their 
native Southeast Asia, but are of extreme importance to banana breeders 
who are developing a successor to the Cavendish, against the inevitable 
day when it will succumb to disease.

All commercial seedless bananas are either <i>polyploids</i> (sterile 
genetic diploids, triploids or tetraploids) of one of the two species 
listed above, or are hybrids of the two. They are given letter 
designations from the first letters of the two species. The old name 
<i>paradisiaca</i> was rather confused and has been dropped.<p></p>

<h2>Burro</h2>
<br><img src="img/bn_burro01h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Burro bananas" class=mrg>
This banana is now fairly available in Southern California particularly in 
ethnic groceries. It's short, rather squarish in cross section and more 
flavorful than the Cavendish. They are noted for a hint of lemon in the 
flavor. They look very like the Philippine Saba banana, but apparently 
are different and much less sweet.<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="bancav">Cavendish</h2>
<br><img src="img/bn_caven05h.jpg" alt="Ripe Cavendish Bananas" class=mrg>
[Chiquita Banana, Grand Nain; <i>Musa acuminata</i> (AAA group)]
<p>
This is your supermarket banana, grown on huge plantations of 
genetically identical plants to support a $4 billion export market. It is 
not the best tasting banana but holds its dominant position by convenience 
of storage and shipping. It is ripe when it shows a few small black spots 
on the peel. These bananas run between 7 and 8 inches long, (not counting 
the stem), 1-5/8 inches across and typically weigh between 6-1/2 and 7-1/2 
ounces  A 6-7/8 ounce banana was 4-7/8 ounces after peeling for a yield of 
70%. Smaller bananas yield less.</p>
<p>The Cavendish is propagated by root suckers. It's a sterile seedless 
banana producing neither pollen nor seed, Every plant is an offshoot of 
one single original plant. This lack of diversity places the crop at 
great risk of disease and there's no way to breed disease resistance.</p>
<p>Currently the black sigatoka fungus is a major problem and airborne 
spraying is the only defense, accounting for a full 20% of the cost of 
growing bananas. A soil bacteria called Tropical Race 4 also now threatens 
the Cavendish, just as a previous variety wiped out its commercial predecessor, 
<a href="banana.html#banmike">Gros Michel</a>. Prepare at least for higher prices and 
the possible disappearance of the familiar seedless dessert banana.

[Pisang Tongkat Langit (Moluccas); <i>Musa x troglodytarum</i>]
<p>
This unique banana is cultivated in the South Pacific islands, from 
the Moluccas east to French Polynesia, south to New Caledonia and north 
to the Federated States of Micronesia. Some are also grown on Hawaii. 
It is still unknown which wild species they developed from. They are 
distinguished by the bunches pointing skyward and the fruit being 
bright orange, copper color or red, and often having distinct ridges. 
The flesh is yellow to orange, and they fall into the general category 
of "cooking bananas". These are not cultivated commercially and are not 
sold in North America.

[FHIA0-01; (AAAB group)]
<p>
A new variety developed in Honduras and introduced in 1994. It has 
become fairly popular in Australia but has yet to penetrate the North 
American Market. It is much more pest resistant than the Cavendish. The 
Goldfinger can be cooked into fries when green, but is expected to be 
more popular fully ripe.

[Big Mike; (AAA group)]
<p>
This is the original banana imported to the U.S. and the original product 
of the United Fruit Company (originally the Boston Fruit Company - now 
Chiquita Brands). It was wiped out as a commercial product in the early 
1950s by Panama Disease, forcing United Fruit to replant in 
<a href="banana.html#bancav">Cavindish</a>, a less flavorful and more difficult to 
ship variety. The photo specimens were grown in Jamaica, but they are 
also grown in Thailand.

[Hua Moa (Chicken Egg) Banana, Hawaiiano, (AAB group) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
similar, possibly the same, Popoulu Banana]
<p>
Native to Southeast Asia, this banana was taken by canoe to the  
Marquesas Islands and then on to Hawaii. It was introduced to Florida 
in 1960 and some are grown in Dade County. They have become a favorite 
there for the Cuban and Caribbean communities as cooking bananas. The 
skins are very thin and the taste is sweet-sour. They are often baked 
with cinnamon and sugar, or crushed and fried. Colombians use them in 
a meat soup.  The photo shows three stages of ripening. The left and 
center are both fine for cooking, while the piece to the right is still 
firm, a bit starchy, and only lightly sweet.</p>
<p>These bananas are not easy to grow. they need a warm, protected 
location free of Panama disease, and a lot of care. The photo 
specimens, grown in Florida, were typically 7-1/2 inches long and 2-3/4 
inches diameter, weighing 1 pound 2 ounces. The largest I've bought 
(not in photo) was 1 pound 9 ounces, 8-1/2 inches long and 3 inches 
diameter. They were purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles 
(Eagle Rock) for 2017 US $1.29 / pound.

<h2>Lacatan Banana</h2>
<br><img src="img/bn_lacatan01h.jpg" alt="Ripe Lacatan Bananas" class=mrg>
[Lakatan Banana;  (AA group)]
<p>
These bananas are one of the three most popular varieties in the Philippines 
and preferred to the Cavendish as a desert banana, even though they are more 
expensive. Not yet readily available in North America, they are distinguished 
by a slightly orange color.

<p>
These small bananas are now grown in many areas and are easily available 
in Southern California markets catering to Latino populations. They 
should be eaten when they show a fair number of black spots but before 
they become predominantly black. They have a faint apple or strawberry 
flavor but mostly taste like bananas.

[#4235, Cooking Banana; Macho Banana (Markets); Dodo (West Africa); 
(AAB and ABB groups)]
<p>
This is a culinary classification of bananas, and not a specific 
scientific definition. This name is applied to bananas that are starchier 
and less sweet than "dessert" bananas like Cavendish. Plantains are most 
often cooked while still green or somewhat green, but are also cooked when 
yellow, depending on taste and texture desired. They are still quite firm 
when solid yellow and can still be fried in that state. Some recipes call 
for them ripe, when they will be solid black and finally have softened. 
The flesh tends to be a little orange in color. The average plantain 
sold in North America is about 12 inches long and weighs about 9-3/4 
ounces. 
&nbsp; <a href="bn_plantz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>

<h3>Plantain Stems <small>&amp;</small> Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Stems are 
eaten particularly in southern India (Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala). When 
the bunch of bananas is harvested, the plant is cut down and layers peeled 
off to get to the tender central stalk. This is chopped and prepared in 
salads and curries. The outer layers are used for binding string and for 
weaving mats. Young immature Shoots are sometimes cooked and eaten in 
Ethiopia.<p></p>

<h3>Plantain Roots:</h3> &nbsp; Root corms are sometimes eaten in 
Ethiopia, but not as commonly as those of the related Enset. They are 
soft and starchy just before the flowering stage.<p></p>

<h3>Plantain Leaves <small>&amp;</small> Blossoms</h3>: &nbsp; These 
are used the same as those of other bananas.

[Red Dacca Banana (Au); (AAA group)]
<p>
These short bananas are now very popular with supermarkets in upscale 
areas because their exotic appearance allows the market to charge high 
prices. They tastes pretty much like bananas, but sweeter than the 
Cavendish. They should be eaten when the first black spots appear.

<h2>Saba Banana</h2>
<img src="img/bn_saba03k.jpg" alt="Hand of Saba" class=mrg>
[Carababa Banana, Philippine Plantain; (ABB group)]
<p>
This is one of the most popular bananas in the Philippines and is 
occasionally available in Philippine markets here in Southern California. 
It is small and rather boxy in shape. The photo specimens were between 6 
and 6-1/2 inches long (not counting stem) and weighed about 6-1/4 ounces. 
A 6-1/4 ounce specimen yielded 3 ounces peeled (48%). In the yellow state 
shown they were rather firm, starchy and not particularly sweet - but 
would be a little sweeter with more black splotches. This banana is 
sometimes eaten raw but most often boiled in the skin and served with 
a sweet sauce.

in North America, as they are being grown in vast quantity in Mexico. 
They are usable for both cooking and eating out of hand, or in fruit 
salads and the like. Because of their growing impoatance, they now have

This is a a flavorful disease resistant African "desert" variety from the 
Congo which could become a popular dessert banana if disease destroys the 
familiar Cavendish (though it is somewhat smaller). It is being studied 
for resistance to both pests ane disease.Much of the ongoing development 
work is being done by The University of Leuven (KU Leuven) of Belgium.

This pointy heart shape item is the male inflorescence of the banana or

consists of red leaf like bracts covering rows of male flowers. The bracts 
curl up one by one, each exposing a row of flowers (not "baby bananas" as so 
many descriptions say). Above the "blossom" are a large number of female 
flowers that will mature into bananas  Commercial bananas are sterile, so 
the male inflorescence is not needed for pollination</p>

Banana leaf is used in many tropical areas of the world in place of 
plates, particularly at banquets and other large events, and in street

Leaves are also an important food wrapper particularly to hold and 
protect food during steaming and for making rice cakes, which may be 
cylindrical or pyramid shaped.</p>

Enset is planted widely in Ethiopia and noteworthy as a durable, long lived 
crop providing a hedge against famine. The tiny banana-like fruits are not 
edible, but the starchy root corm is. A tree takes four to five years to 
mature, at which time the root can weigh around 80 pounds. There are related 
ensets in India, Yunan, China and Thailand but they are not so important for 
food as in Ethiopia. See <a href="banana.html#b1">Note-B1</a>.

<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Bananas are considered in both tradition and modern medicine to be 
very healthy and nutritious to eat. Here are a few strong points.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Potassium:</b> &nbsp; This is a mineral bananas are particularly 
  noted for. It can help with salt balance, blood pressure and water 
  balance. It is said to aid cognitive function, particularly in children.
  </li>
<li><b>Tryptophan:</b> &nbsp; While banana provides only 100th the amount 
  in an equal weight of egg white, it is still reputed to be calming to 
  the nerves, and is considered "cooling" in traditional Asian medicine.
  </li>
<li><b>Iron:</b> &nbsp; Bananas contain enough iron to be helpful in 
  cases of anemia, as it stimulates formation of red blood cells.</li>
<li><b>Dietary Fiber:</b> &nbsp; Bananas are considered to have a very 
  beneficial influence on the digestive tract, due to fiber and its 
  general nature.</li>
