[Common Barberry, European Barberry; Zereshk (Persian for dried); 
Kotsakburi (Georgian); Berberis (Arabic); Agracejo (Spanish);
<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>  &nbsp; | &nbsp; Bidaneh (Persian); 
<i>Berberis integerrima</i> (seedless variety)]
<p>
The fruit of this shrub is rather tart from being high in vitamin C. 
It was once widely used in Europe as a souring agent, but has been 
replaced by citrus fruits due to difficulty harvesting - lots of very 
sharp spines on the branches. The berries are still made into jams to 
some extent. Today, this fruit is most popular in Iran.</p>

<p>Barberry was once very common in North America and used for jam and 
wine, but it is an alternate host for a very serious wheat stem rust, so 
has been eradicated from large regions and is illegal in Canada. There 
are varieties of barberry immune to the rust, and these are allowed in 
quarantine regions in the United States.</p>

<p>In Iran and Afghanistan, these berries are sprinkled on top of rice 
pilafs, and also used in chicken and meat dishes. In Georgia they 
are ground and used to add a fruity flavor to meat and meat dumplings,
and are similarly used in Armenia. In Georgia, they are also made into 
a very sour syrup. In northwest India, they are pickled and used with 
curries.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are not easy to find in stores, but 
here in Los Angeles we have large populations of Iranians and Armenians, 
and some Georgians, so multi-ethnic markets often have dried barberries. 
I have purchased Golchin brand in a 6 ounce tub at U.S. 2015 $1.16 per 
ounce, but my last purchase was from a bulk bin in an Armenian market in 
Sunland. Some other multi-ethnic markets here have them in small plastic 
bags labeled Zereshk. They are available on-line for prices between 
$1.25 per ounce and $7.68 per ounce, plus shipping. The Golchin were 
nice, not too dry and the bulk bin ones were just as good.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; It is best to keep them tightly sealed in 
their original package or in a 2 mil plastic bag and refrigerated. 
otherwise they become darker and much too dry.<p></p>

<p><b>Substitute:</b> &nbsp; Ground Sumac, easily available from markets 
serving an eastern Mediterranean community, is a suitable substitute.</p>
