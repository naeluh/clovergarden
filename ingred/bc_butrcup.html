<h1>Buttercup Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Order <i>Ranunculales</i> (the Buttercups) is a fairly large order 
of plants, most of which are highly to extremely toxic, some of which 
have strong medicinal properties, and a very few have culinary uses. 
Here we consider only the culinary species.

<h2>Poppy Seed</h2>
<br><a href="rn_poppyz.html">
<img src="img/bc_poppys02d.jpg" alt="Tiny White and Black Poppy Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Family <i>Papaveraceae</i>]
<p>
The poppy of culinary interest is the Opium Poppy, <i>Papaver 
somniferum</i>, the tiny seeds of which are used on baked goods in the 
U.S. and in curries and other dishes in India. Poppy seed oil is used for 
cooking in some parts of the world, but for slow drying artist's oil 
paints in North America.</p>

<p>In Western cooking, black poppy seeds are presumed. In Indian cooking, 
where they are used both for flavoring and as a thickener, the somewhat 
milder white variety is presumed. Opium is harvested from the same seed 
pods but by time the seeds are mature there is negligible opium in the 
pods - however, do avoid poppy seed rolls and the like before a drug test 
- you can be found positive. 
&nbsp; <a href="rn_poppyz.html"><b>Details &amp; Cooking</b></a>.</p>

<p>Pictured at the top of the page is <i>P. Eschscholzia californica</i>, 
the California poppy, which is supposed to have a mild opiate effect when 
the dried sap is smoked, but is not supposed to be addictive. I haven't 
tried it so I can't confirm or deny. Seeds of the California Poppy have 
been used in cooking, but the yield per pod is relatively small.

<h2>Nigella</h2> 
<br><a href="rn_nigelaz.html">
<img src="img/bc_nigella02d.jpg" alt="Tiny black Nigella seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Kalonji (Hindi); Charnushka (Russia, U.S. Armenian); C&ouml;rek otu 
(Turkish); Siyah Daneh (Persian); Kalo Jeera, Kalojira, Black Cumin 
(Bengali only, otherwise improper), Black Caraway (improper); 
Onion Seed (improper); <i>Nigella sativa</i>]
<p>
This member of the mostly toxic Ranunculales order is native to 
South and Southwest Asia. The seeds, which look a bit like the totally 
unrelated onion seeds, are used as a spice in India, the Middle East, 
Near East, Anatolia, Caucasus, Greece and Egypt. They have a strong, 
aromatic and slightly bitter taste.

<h2>Barberry</h2>
<br><a href="bc_barbz.html">
<img src="img/bc_barb03e.jpg" alt="Dried Barberry Fruit" class=mrg></a>
[Common Barberry, European Barberry; Zereshk (Persian for dried); 
Kotsakburi (Georgian); Berberis (Arabic); Agracejo (Spanish);
<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>  &nbsp; | &nbsp; Bidaneh (Persian); 
<i>Berberis integerrima</i> (seedless variety)]
<p>
The fruit of this shrub is rather tart from being high in vitamin C. 
It was once widely used in Europe as a souring agent, but has been 
replaced by citrus fruits due to difficulty harvesting - lots of very 
sharp spines on the branches. The berries are still made into jams to 
some extent. Today, this fruit is most popular in Iran, particularly 
as a topping for rice pilavs, but also with chicken and meats. They 
are also used in Georgia, Armenia, Afghanistan and India.

<h2 id="calaf">Calafate Barberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/bc_calafate01h.jpg" alt="Calafate Barberry Fruit on Bush" class=mrg>
[Magellan Barberry; <i>Berberis microphylla</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Michay, 
Calafate; <i>Berberis darwinii</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the south of Argentina and Chile, particularly 
Patagonia. It grows to 3 to 4 feet high and has arching branches with a 
lot of very sharp spines on them. It fruits fairly heavily, with the 
fruit maturing to a blue-black color. The plant is farmed commercially 
for its fruit which is eaten fresh and made into jams.

<h2 id="oregg">Oregon Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/bc_oregong01e.jpg" alt="Oregon Grape Shrub w/Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Mahonia aquifolium</i> alt <i>Berberis aquifolium</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Creeping Oregon Grape, Creeping Barberry; <i>Mahonia repens</i>]
<p>
This shrub, closely related to the Barberries, is widely planted as a 
decorative here in California and up the coast to Washington state. Few 
realize the berries are edible, though they are rather tart. They were 
used by the Northwest Indians mixed with sweeter fruit, particularly 
<a href="er_heath.html#sal">Salal berries</a>. Today they are 
still used to make jams, and still usually mixed with sweeter fruit. 
The low sub-shrub creeping species is used similarly, but tolerates 
hotter, dryer climate and ranges from Canada down through Arizona, 
New Mexico and parts of California and Nevada.

<h2 id="trifol">Chaparral Berry</h2>
<br><img src="img/bc_mtrifol01e.jpg" alt="Chaparral Berry Shrub w/Fruit" class=mrg>
[Agarita, Agrito, Algerita, Currant-of-Texas, Wild Currant; 
<i>Mahonia trifoliolata</i> alt <i>Berberis trifoliolata</i>]
<p>
This shrub, closely related to the Barberries, is native to Texas, 
Arizona and New Mexico in the Southwest United States. It is widely 
cultivated in desert regions. The berries are harvested between April and 
May. The sweet-sour fruit is used to make fruit drinks, a fruit wine 
(Agarita), jams and jellies.

<h2 id="yanang">Yanang Leaf</h2>
<br><img src="img/bc_yanang02e.jpg" alt="Whole Yanang Leaves" class=mrg>
[Bai Yanang (Issan, Laos); Voar Yeav (Khmer); Day Suong Sam (Thai); 
<i>Tiliacora Triandra</i>]
<p>
This climbing plant is native to northast Thailand (Issan), Laos, 
Vietnam and Cambodia. In Issan, leaves are used particularly in a soup 
called Kaeng no Mai or Kaeng Lao. It is not used as a flavoring element 
but as a thickener. Leaves are rubbed between the hands under water 
until all the green is in the water and the fibers can be removed. 
The water is called Nam Yanang (yanang water). It is similarly used 
in Cambodian Sour Soup (Samlar machu). In Vietnam it is used to make 
a jelly called Suong Sam.</p>
<p>The photo specimens are very dark because they were formerly frozen. 
In life, the leaves are a medium green. The photo specimens were about 
4-1/8 inches long and 1-7/8 inches wide. They were purchased frozen 
from an Asian Market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2016 US $1.09 for 
3.5 ounces. Canned Yanang Leaves Extract is often used in Southeast 
Asia, and Aroy-D brand in 14 ounce cans is available in North America.

<h2>Curare Family</h2>
<br><img src="img/bc_curare01c.jpg" alt="Curare Plant Watercolor" class=mrg>
[family <i>Menispermaceae</i>]
<p>
The only culinary application for this family of Buttercups is in 
acquiring animal based food. From <i>M. Curarea</i> and other species of 
this family South American natives acquired the extreme neuromuscular 
toxin curare, used to poison hunting darts. Substances extracted from 
members of this plant family are the source for a number of important 
medicinals.
