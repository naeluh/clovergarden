</p><p>
Hundreds of varieties of domesticated chickens are now raised 
worldwide. They are a critical economical food resource, both for eggs and 
meat, except in India where both chickens and eggs are scarce and expensive.
All varieties, fancy and plain, are descend from a single subspecies 
of Southeast Asian red jungle fowl. That original wild chicken is still 
doing well, holding its wide natural range in Southeast Asia, but the one 
in the photo is living happily in Hawaii.

<h2 id="intro">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><img src="img/bd_chkredjung02k.jpg" alt="Jungle Hen" class=mrg>
The hundreds of varieties of domestic chickens (<i>Gallus gallus 
domesticus</i>) were all developed from a single subspecies of Southeast 
Asian red jungle fowl (<i>Gallus gallus gallus</i>). The first really hard 
evidence of domesticated chickens is from China about 6000 BCE, but in 
regions not suitable for red jungle fowl, so they must have been 
domesticated elsewhere. Evidence now points to Vietnam about 10,000 years 
ago. &nbsp; <small>Photo of jungle hen by Adamantiaf distributed under license

<p>Chickens were found not only highly susceptible to domestication but 
tolerant of various climates - and they eat just about anything. They 
arrived in Egypt about 1430 BCE from Babylon and entered the Greco-Roman 
world in about 500 BCE, but are not mentioned in the Hebrew/Christian Old 
Testament so they probably were not kept in the Levant.</p>
<p>Chickens were brought to North America by Europeans, but are now proven 
to have been introduced to South America by Polynesians in 
pre-Columbian times - settling once and for all the question of Polynesians 
traveling to the Americas (sorry, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki">Thor</a>).</p>
<br>

<h2 id="size" class=lrg>Types, Sizes <small>&</small> Uses</h2>

<p>Unlike turkeys, you don't have to chose between hens and toms because 
they aren't marked. Several sizes of chicken are available on the market 
to be used in different ways. Growers generally use different varieties for 
each size, the object being to select varieties that "plump out" (develop 
thick breast meat) at different ages and weights. From youngest to oldest:
<ul>
<li><h3>Poussin:</h3> [Coquelet] A really young chicken (less than 28 days) 
weighing around 1 pound (400 to 500 grams) - enough for one person if 
there's plenty else to eat. While quite common in Europe they're not to be 
found in US markets, save perhaps in some specialty shops serving 
the high priced chef set.</li>
<li><h3>Cornish Game Hen:</h3> [Game Hen, Rock Cornish, Cornish] A young 
chicken (30 to 40 days) of special breed weighing between 1 and 2 pounds 
(450 to 900 grams). They are very common frozen in US supermarkets, often 
packed two to a tray. A large one (2 pounds) can serve two persons if there 
is a side dish, soup or salad. Cornish game hens were developed in 
Connecticut and are pretty much an American item, as difficult to find in 
Europe as Poussins are to find here. They were originally a cross between 
a Cornish cock and a Plymouth Rock hen, and are in no way "game".</li>
<li><h3>Fryer / Broiler:</h3> A young chicken killed at 7 to 13 weeks and 
weighing between 3 and 5 pounds. This is your standard supermarket chicken, 
sold both fresh and frozen in mass market, boutique and kosher formats. Serves 
3 to 4 people.</li>
<li><h3>Roasters:</h3> A mature chicken killed at 3 to 5 months and weighing 
between 4-1/2 and 8 pounds. Often parts are too thick to fry and some consider 
them less than ideal for roasting as well, but I figure if you can roast a 
turkey you can probably roast a large chicken. Serves 5 to 7 people.</li>
<li><h3>Capon:</h3> A rooster that's had his rocks cut off in childhood so 
he grows up big and soft and doesn't bother the hens or fight with other 
capons. They are generally killed at under 8 months when they will weigh 6 
to 9 pounds. The meat is tender and considered the finest flavor of all 
chickens, but the bird will have more fat than others. This is a specialty 
shop item - I've never seen one in Southern California markets.</li>
<li><h3>Stewing Chicken:</h3> Over 10 months old, 5 to 8 pounds and not 
generally found in the supermarkets. They're often a byproduct of the egg 
industry - hens beyond their peak laying age.</li>
<li><h3>Old Hen / Old Rooster:</h3>
<br><img src="img/bd_chkroost01s.jpg" alt="Old Rooster" class=mrg>
<br>Old Hen is a barnyard chicken generally at the end of her egg 
production. Tasty but tough and should be long cooked in soup or stew. Old 
Rooster (Photo) is even tougher. It's said you can boil him until the bones 
dissolve and the meat will still be tough. I've cooked old hen and that 
was tough enough, thank you.

<br class=cll></li>
<li><h3>Silkie</h3>
<br><a href="bd_chksilkz.html">
<img src="img/bd_chksilk01s.jpg" alt="White Chicken" class=mrg></a>
A very unusual chicken with fur-like feathers. It is thought some 
dinosaurs may have had feathers like this. Silkies also have blue-black 
skin and black bones. They are used mainly by Chinese and Southeast Asian 
peoples, often to make a tonic soup combined with medicinal herbs and 
roots. <a href="bd_chksilkz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<br>

<h2 id="yield" class=lrg>Parts &amp; Yields</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>To replace the meat of a whole chicken with skinless/boneless meat 
  you need a little over half the weight of the whole chicken called for.
  Use good stock instead of water in the recipe to replace flavors 
  expected from the whole chicken.<p></p></li>

<li>To replace skinless/boneless meat with the meat of a a whole chicken, 
  you need a chicken weighing (after removing giblets) a little less than 
  twice the weight of the meat called for.<p></p></li>

<li>Simmered meat will weigh about 64% of the weight of the raw meat. 
  By poaching (190&deg;F/88&deg;C to 198&deg;F/92&deg;C) and cooling 
  in the broth, you can get as high as 70%. <p></p></li>

<li>For making stock, the fat goes into the pot along with the skin, 
  bones, and off-cuts. Chefs have found much of the flavor we expect 
  from fat is water soluble. Remove the fat from the strained stock 
  using your   gravy separator. For details see our 
  <a href="../recipes/goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> 
  page.</li>
</ul>

<p>This table below is for a chicken sold packaged as 6.12 pounds (5.8 
pounds unpacked). A smaller chicken will not yield as high a percentage 
of meat. A 3 pound chicken may yield as low as 80% of the table 
percentage (42% instead of 52%)</p>

<p><u>Example:</u> &nbsp; To know how much weight in whole chickens you 
must buy to have 5 pounds of breast meat, use the <b>Whole Chicken</b> 
table. divide 5 pounds by 0.28 (28%) to find 17.9 pounds of whole 
chickens. Conversely, to find out how much skinless, boneless breast 
meat your 5 pound chicken will yield, multiply 5 by 0.28 to get 1.4 
pounds (1 pound 6 ounces).</p>

<p><u>Example:</u> &nbsp; To find how much weight in whole thighs you 
need to buy to yield 3 pounds of skinless, boneless thigh meat, use the 
<b>Parts</b> table. Divide 3 pounds by 0.55 (55%) to find 5.45 pounds of 
whole thighs. Conversely, to find out how much meat a 4.5 pound tray of 
thighs will yield, multiply 4.5 by 0.55 to get 2.48 pounds.</p>
