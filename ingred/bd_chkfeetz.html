<h1>Chicken Feet</h1>

<p>
In Asia chicken feet are enjoyed in soup, stews and on their own by all 
classes. In South Africa they are much eaten but most commonly by the poor. 
Chicken feet also play a part in the cuisines of Eastern Europe and the 
US South. In Thailand, boned chicken feet are used in salads.</p>

<p>Chicken feet have no meat but are high in collagen and reputed to be good 
for joints and wrinkles.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find them in ethnic markets, particularly those 
serving Asian communities. In Southern California they're generally 
packed in foam trays weighing about 1-1/2 pounds, about 23 feet, and 
are completely cleaned and ready to go except for clipping off the 
claws (usually left on in South African practice).<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; In life, chicken feet have a hard yellow scally 
outer skin but this is removed before they go to market, at least around 
here. If any remains, scrape it off. Cut off the claws (kitchen shears) 
and trim off any hard spots on the bottom of the feet. If your chicken 
feet are not perfectly clean rub them with salt to clean them thoroughly. 
Rinse and scald in boiling water for 1 minute, drain and cool.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken feet are often boiled in soup stock to 
add body. They are also used as an ingredient in soups and stews. In Asia 
they are often served whole, generally after deep frying them then stewing 
them in a sauce. Cooking time is generally about 1-1/2 hours or just a bit 
more.<p></p>

<p>In Chinese dim sum restaurants whole chicken feet are a common item,  
most often deep fried and then stewed in a black bean sauce. The 
proper way to eat them is to pick up a foot with chopsticks (significant 
chopstick skills required) and start eating from the tips of the toes 
(claws are always removed). They are taken a joint at a time and the bone 
is spit out after the edable part is enjoyed. </p>

<p>In South Africa chicken feet (Walkie) are often grilled along with the 
heads (Talkie). Not only do they not cut off the claws, for "regular" 
(crunchy) they don't scrape off the scaly layer. For "well done" (soft) 
the scales are scraped off.</p>

<h2>Boned Chicken Feet</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_ckfeetb03e.jpg" alt="Boned Chicken Feet" class=mrg>
Boned Chicken Feet are used in salads in Southeast Asia, particularly 
Thailand and Malaysia. They are boned by steaming or simmering until the 
skin and tendons are like a stiff jelly. The bones are then pushed out 
leaving the tendons still in the chicken foot shape. 
The photo specimens were purchased at a large market in Los Angeles 
serving Chinese and Southeast Asian communities.
