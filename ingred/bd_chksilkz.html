<h1>Silkie Chicken</h1>

[Black Chicken, La Soyeuse Poulet (French), <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>]

<p>This small Asian chicken possibly originated in China, or maybe 
farther south, but the first written record of them is in the journals of 
Marco Polo. Silkies are unlike any other chicken. They come in various 
colors, white and black being most common, but their feathers are like 
soft fur. This is because of a recessive gene - some dinosaurs had 
feathers of this sort. The skin under those soft feathers is blue-black, 
the bones are black and even the flesh is dark and bluish. They have 
five toes rather than four as found on all but a few other odd types of 
chicken.</p>
<p>Silkies grown in North American are bantam varieties that can grow to 2 
pounds at full maturity, but they're generally marketed at 1 to 1-1/2 
pounds. In Europe, larger silkies are grown that can reach 4 pounds when 
fully mature. They are not particularly good egg layers because as soon 
as they have a few eggs they want to settle down and hatch them. Good 
layers are bred to not want to be bothered with hatching.</p>
<p>Silkies are very tame and gentle, making good pets. Hens are often 
assigned to hatching the eggs and tending the chicks of less attentive 
birds. They are, however, also widely eaten in East and Southeast Asia 
and are considered to have strong medicinal powers. They are now grown 
for the market in North America, but they'll set you back a pretty penny 
- and many people here think they're just too cute to eat.

This is what you get when you cut open the vacuum package - yup, looks a 
whole lot like a dead chicken. If you have a problem with that, be aware 
- it gets worse. Not only is the skin black, so are the bones, and the 
flesh is blue-gray to blue-brown. The inside cavity is coal black.</p>

<p>These birds are most noted for use in Chinese tonic soups, combined 
with a number of medicinal herbs and roots. They are most often prepared 
for new mothers right after giving birth.  Silkies are also braised and 
stewed in various ways. They are not used for stir fries and other 
briefly cooked dishes because they are tougher than regular chickens. 
Aside from China these chickens are eaten in Southeast Asia and to a 
lesser extent in Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>Because silkies are expensive to raise, chicken breeders are attempting 
to develop more productive, normally feathered chickens with the black 
flesh gene. None are currently marketed, and it's doubtful they will 
be accepted as having the same medicinal properties as the silkie.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Silkies are now easy to find frozen in markets 
serving East or Southeast Asian communities. Typically they are sold with 
head and feet attached under USDA Exemption Permit 101 (Buddhist 
Exemption). They are expensive, typically over US $10 for a 1-1/2 pound 
bird even in Los Angeles. The photo specimen to the left was grown in 
Canada and weighed 1.47 pounds.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Silkies aren't particularly meaty but they contain 
almost no fat so yield is decent, about 60% edible depending on cooking 
method. Most of the lost weight is in the head, neck and feet.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; For general preparation there is no significant 
difference between these and Cornish game hens - except for needing to cut 
off the feet and head (which are properly used in making stock).
<p>Despite what you're told by the US FDA, the best and safest way to thaw 
birds (any size) is in cold water, either in their sterile vacuum pack or 
with frequent changing of the water. This method is approved by the USDA 
for commercial and institutional establishments.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  Use recipes for which the deeper flavor of 
the silkie (even the breasts) will not violate the intent of the recipe 
and the color won't be a problem. Keep in mind they need to be cooked 
long enough to be tender. They can be used in place of game birds but 
the flavor is closer to chicken.

<p>In Asian cooking, most chickens are skinned before cooking, but these 
are done skin-on. After all, when you're paying that much extra for the 
skin color you don't want to throw it out - and unlike normal domestic 
chickens there is almost no fat under the skin.</p>
