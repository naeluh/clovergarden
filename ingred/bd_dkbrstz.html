Forget about finding duck breasts in markets in Los Angeles - if you want 
breasts you'll have to buy whole ducks and figure out what to do with the 
rest. The reason is simple - the breasts are all sold to the restaurant 
trade where the highest price can be had. Prestigious duck recipes that don't 
call for whole duck generally call for breast. Duck breasts (both halves 
together) weigh around 13 to 14 ounces (boneless). 9 to 10 ounces (67%) 
is meat, the rest being skin and fat - which is almost always left in 
place for cooking.
<p>Do not expect white meat - duck is all dark and the meat of all parts 
tastes much the same. On the other hand, you won't have flavorless cardboard 
breast meat as with commercial chickens.<p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Buy a whole duck and figure out how to use the 
rest of it. Nearly all breasts not attached to the rest of the duck go 
into the restaurant trade where a high price can be had.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Not much prep required, once you've got them off 
the Duck. Most recipes call for breasts to be sliced with fat and skin 
on the edge of each slice.  Note that the "tenderloin" (the inner strip 
- see right specimen in photo above) will come loose, it has almost no 
adhesion to the rest of the breast.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Use only duck recipes. This is dark meat and 
takes a lot longer to cook than chicken breast - and the skin and fat 
is almost always included. This is not low calorie fare.<p></p>
