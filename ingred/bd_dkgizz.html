Duck gizzards are very popular in France, but in North America they are most 
used in Asian recipes. Duck gizzards have a different flavor (duck) and 
different texture than Chicken gizzards - they are crunchy rather than 
rubbery. They are expensive in France and China, but reasonably priced in 
North America due to fewer cooks who know what to do with them.
<p>In life the gizzard is a thick walled muscular sack full of rocks the 
duck uses as a ball mill to grind up everything it eats. They are 
"extra dark" meat with a more intense flavor than any other muscle in 
the duck. Poultry processors cut the gizzards into several pieces, clean 
them and remove the associated plumbing. Generally they are frozen for 
shipment but may be thawed and packed in trays at your store. The photo shows 
typical gizzard pieces as sold.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find them in ethnic markets serving a Chinese 
community. In Southern California they're generally peeled, cut and cleaned 
as shown above, packed in foam plastic trays weighing about 1 pound.
<p></p>

<p>French duck gizzards, as shown to the left, are probably available in 
upscale gourmet outlets. They are sold canned, whole or cut, as confit 
(seasoned, cooked and packed in fat).</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; If in the form described above, about as close to 
100% as you can get.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If in the form described above, rinse gizzards and 
remove any fat left by the processor. Just scrape it down to the edge where 
it's easy to cut off. Gizzard pieces vary quite a bit in size, but they are usually 
sliced fairly thin before cooking.
<p>If you have fresh whole gizzards or in the form shown to the left, you 
need to peel off the tough outer membrane before cutting.
