<h1>Duck Legs</h1>

Duck legs  differ from chicken legs in being short and wide, and with 
relatively little fat. They are reasonably economical and your best bet 
for getting duck meat without much fat. They always come with the thigh 
because the thigh isn't large enough to sell as a separate cut as with 
chicken. A duck leg/thigh weighs about 8.5 ounces.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find duck legs in markets serving a Chinese or 
Southeast Asian community, generally in the frozen meat section. They are 
sold with the thigh attached because the thigh is not large enough to be 
sold as a separate cut. They are reasonably available because the major 
market is for duck breast, but each duck comes with two legs as well.

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Duck legs are a little more difficult to debone and 
disjoint than chicken legs because the joints are much tighter and there 
is almost no cartilage. If you remove the skin, it has to be carefully 
cut loose with a sharp knife because it adheres much more tightly to the 
flesh than with chicken. An 8.5 ounce leg/thigh will yield 4.5 ounces  
(53%) of skinless boneless meat. It will yield only 1.1 oz (13%) 
renderable fat<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Duck legs and thighs can be used similarly to 
chicken legs and thighs but need to be cooked at least twice as long or 
they will be tough. If you are not including the skin in your recipe you 
can render the fat from it in a small frying pan, and eat the cracklings 
as a snack. The fat is prized for cooking.<p></p>
