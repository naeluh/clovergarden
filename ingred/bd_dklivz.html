<h1>Duck Liver</h1>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkliver02g.jpg" alt="Whole Duck Liver" class=mrg>
If you buy a whole duck you'll get a liver inside - if you're lucky. 
You won't find them in markets because they are in high demand with 
chefs and food processors for making p&acirc;t&eacute;s. If you want 
more you'll have to make a special deal with a duck farm or poultry 
vendor. The photo specimen was found frozen inside a duck and weighed 
1-1/4 ounce.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; If you want more than what you get inside a duck, 
forget stores - you'll need to make a deal with a poultry vendor or duck 
farm - and outbid the  p&acirc;t&eacute; makers.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; If you got one with your duck, take the neck 
skin and render the fat from it in a small frying pan. Eat the cracklings. 
Slice your duck liver and give it a very brief frying. Eat with a little 
lemon juice and salt.<p></p>
