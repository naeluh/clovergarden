Duck necks are cheap and plentiful here in Los Angeles. They are the best 
way to make a nice, relatively clear duck stock for soup. The photo 
specimens are about 8 inches long, 1 inch in diameter and weight about 4 
ounces each.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find them in markets serving a Chinese community. 
In Southern California they're generally skinned and packaged in foam plastic 
trays weighing about 2 pounds at about 2009 US $1.19/pound.<p></p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Chop the necks into about 2 inch lengths using 
a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife. Put in a pot with plenty of water so 
they're well covered, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 4 to 6 hours. 
Yes, this is much longer than for chicken. If desired, you can add some 
aromatic vegetables and herbs for the last half hour of cooking.
<p>When done, strain out and discard the solids. Separate the fat using 
your gravy separator. Discard the fat and refrigerate stock until needed.
