<h1>Roasting <small>a</small> Duck</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Roast duck is most popular in France, China and Southeast Asia. The most 
famous recipe is Peking Duck, but that's nearly impossible at home, 
and even for a restaurant involves special ovens, special ducks and 
conflicts with animal rights activists and health inspectors. Here we'll 
use a much simpler method appropriate for home kitchens lacking a large 
staff.

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>General Discussion</h2>

<p>The duck you buy at the market, the Pekin Duck, was developed in China 
around 950 CE and brought to Long Island in the USA over a century ago. 
Roasting a duck is different from roasting a chicken or turkey for a 
number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're not going to have to decide whether fresh or frozen because 
  you'll probably only be able to get frozen.</li>
<li>You aren't going to have to ponder size so much because all the market 
  will have is likely between 4 and 5-1/2 pounds, though I have seen a few 
  as heavy as 7 pounds.</li>
<li>You need not make decisions about sex (the duck's, not your own - can't 
  help you there) because they aren't labeled by gender.</li>
<li>Salting and/or brining are not needed.</li>
<li>Time and finish temperature aren't as critical because a duck isn't 
  going to end up with cardboard breasts if you run 5 degrees over.</li>
<li>Ducks are seldom stuffed, and when they are they are stuffed with 
  fruit. Turkey style stuffings would become saturated with fat.</li>
<li>Duck roasts to a much darker shade.</li>
<li>No sane person tries to roast vegetables in the same pan with a duck.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="equip" class=lrg>Equipment You Will Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <h3>Oven</h3> with good temperature control and sufficient room for the 
  duck and its roasting pan.</li>
<li>A <h3>Roasting Pan</h3>. Highly preferred are shallow pans fitted 
  with a <b>V-rack</b>, and with convenient handles on the pan and the 
  V-rack. Disposable aluminum pans are very dangerously flimsy, and 
  leave the duck soaking in oil.</li>
<li><h3>Aluminum foil</h3> - wide.</li>
<li><h3>Rubber Gloves</h3> - these are for turning the Duck during 
  roasting, and removing the Duck from the V-rack after roasting. 
  Silicone oven gloves work but I simply won't pay the price asked for 
  them, and they're too stiff anyway. Get the thickest set of flock 
  lined rubber dishwashing gloves they have at  your local market in 
  size "extra large". These will do just fine if you are organized and 
  work efficiently.</li>
<li><h3>Meat Thermometer</h3> with a probe long enough to penetrate to 
  the center of the duck thigh. Best is one with a probe on a long cable 
  so you can monitor the temperature without opening the oven.</li>
<li><h3>Kitchen twine</h3> for tying the legs together.</li>
<li><h3>Bamboo skewers</h3> for pinning neck fat and wings.</li>
<li><h3>Basting brush</h3> for the final glaze.</li>
<li><h3>Knives</h3> &nbsp; Forget the carving knife - the best knives for 
  working with duck are a razor sharp boning knife and a santoku or 
  similar thin sharp slicing knife. If you intend to cut it up Chinese 
  style you'll need a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife and a soft 
  faced mallet to drive it through.</li>  
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="plan" class=lrg>Planning <small>&amp;</small> Buying</h2>

<p><h3>Planning</h3> &nbsp; A 5 pound duck, with a salad and a substantial 
side, will serve four. You don't have to plan as far ahead as with turkey 
or goose because duck will thaw pretty quickly and doesn't need salting 
or brining like a turkey.<p></p>

<p><h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You'll probably be buying your duck frozen 
- unless you buy direct from a duck farm or live poultry vendor. The best 
place to buy ducks is in the frozen meat section of a large Asian market - 
they'll have plenty of ducks and the price will likely be much lower than 
in supermarkets.<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="run" class=lrg>Procedure</h2>

<p>This recipe follows French practice - except I do the scalding Chinese 
way which I consider superior, and cooking times are American - the 
French like their ducks a bit on the pink side, which would give our 
USDA bacteriophobes fits.</p>
<p>The object of the temperature changes is to first quickly set the 
skin so it is porous, then cook at a low temperature for a fairly long 
time, and finally brown and crisp at a high temperature. If the low 
temperature phase isn't long enough the duck will be very tough.

<ol>
<li>Thaw the duck thoroughly. Remove the shrink wrap (if packaged that way) 
  and let it sit on a cool counter until thawed, or thaw it in cold running 
  (or very frequently changed) water (see <a href="bd_dkroast.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). 
  Ideally your duck should have reached a cool room temperature just 
  before roasting.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Remove the giblets (gizzard, liver and usually neck), any easily removed 
  lumps of fat, and cut off excess neck skin. Refrigerate or freeze the neck 
  to use in your next batch of stock and reserve the gizzards for soup (dice 
  small). Some French recipes use the liver for sauce, otherwise it's 
  reserved for the cook. Fry it up in a little duck fat (rendered from the 
  neck skin) and eat it with a sprinkle of lemon juice and salt.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Prepare your roasting pan. Cover the V-rack with aluminum foil and punch 
  a bunch of holes through it at the lowest points so it'll drain well and 
  oil it (that duck fat from the neck skin will do fine).
  <p></p></li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Mix the basting liquid - 1T honey, 2T water.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Rinse out your your duck and pull out any gookies or lumps of fat you can 
  still find in there.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Remove the wishbone (to make the front rounder and to make later carving 
  easier). You can push back the skin at the front of the breast and use a 
  sharp boning knife to cut around the top and sides of the wishbone, then 
  bend it out and cut it free at the bottom ends.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Cut off the wing tips - they'll just flop around and burn. Pin the 
  wings to the side with small sharp bamboo skewers.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Tuck the tail into the body cavity and tie the legs together with kitchen 
  twine. 
  <p></p></li>
<li>Pin the neck skin with a bamboo skewer to close the front.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Boil up plenty of water and scald the duck:
  <br><u>French method</u>: &nbsp;  Stand the duck in the sink and pour 
  boiling water over it a couple times until the skin swells. Let drain.
  <br><u>Chinese method</u>: &nbsp; In a wok, or better yet a kadhai (Indian 
  wok), bring plenty of water to a rolling boil. Carefully lower you duck 
  in back side down and ladle boiling water over the exposed parts for about 
  5 minutes. The French don't do it this way because they don't have woks.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Set the duck in the v-rack back side down and slide into the oven. 
  Let roast for about 15 minutes. 
  <p></p></li>
<li>Pull the duck out of the oven and turn breast side down (use the rubber 
  gloves). Slide back in the oven and roast another 10 minutes.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Turn the oven down to 325&deg;F/160&deg;C.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Turn the duck breast side up and roast for another 40 minutes (for a 
  5 pound duck).
  <p></p></li>
<li>Bring the basting liquid to a simmer and keep it warm. With a basting 
  brush, baste the duck all over and return to the oven.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Turn the oven back up to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C. Roast until nicely browned 
  (about 15 minutes) basting three more times.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Verify with a meat thermometer that the thickest part of the duck 
  thigh has reached 165&deg;F/74&deg;C  (see <a href="bd_dkroast.html#02">Note-2</a>). 
  A duck is small and will not have as much temperature rise during resting 
  as a turkey.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Remove duck from the roasting pan (rubber gloves, again). Pour the 
  liquid inside the duck into a pan. It can be used for making sauces or 
  whatever. Place the duck on a platter and let rest for about 10 minutes.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Get any side dishes that need oven finishing into the oven.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Cut the duck apart and slice the breasts - and cut other 
  joints Chinese style if you wish (see <a href="bd_dkroast.html#carve">Carving your 
  Duck</a> below. Use great care that the nice crisp skin doesn't get wet 
  and mushy during this process - duck skin that isn't crispy is chewy.
  <p><p></li>
<li>Arrange on a platter and serve</li>

<h2><u>Notes</u></h2>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Thawing:</h3>  Yes, all the books, recipes, cooking articles 
  and "experts" scream <h3><i>"Never Do This!"</i></h3> but the rabid 
  bacteriophobes at the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) say it's OK. 
  Actual research has proven a cool countertop or cold running water thaw 
  is less risky (on multiple counts) than thawing in the refrigerator, 
  and far easier to time. The "Never Do This" recommendation is based on 
  an FDA decree that has no research whatever to support it. If you find 
  you just won't be ready by time it's thawed, put it back in the fridge 
  <u>before</u> it is completely thawed - making sure it can't touch or 
  drip on anything else.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Final Temperature:</h3> Yes your thermometers and many of your 
  books and recipes say fowl must go to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C - based on an 
  FDA recommendation. That recommendation was reviewed in 2006 and the 
  FDA could find no supporting data whatever, not even scribbled notes, 
  to support the ruinous 180&deg;F recommendation, and now agrees with 
  the USDA that 165&deg;F/74&deg;C is perfectly safe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stuffing Temperature:</h3> &nbsp; If you've stuffed the duck 
  (not usually done, except sometimes with fruit), and find the stuffing 
  just isn't going to make it to 165&deg;F before the duck is overcooked, 
  pull the duck, scoop out the stuffing, put it in a casserole and 
  return it to the oven while the duck rests and gets cut up.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rubber Glove Removal:</h3> To get those slippery gloves off, just 
  wash your hands with cleanser with the gloves on, then they won't be 
  slippery, will pull right off and won't need further washing.</li>
</ol>
</td></tr></table>
<br>

<h2 id="carve" class=lrg>Carving your Duck</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don't attempt to carve at the table - duck is just too awkward for 
  that - you'll look foolish.</li>
<li>As with a turkey you start by bending back the wings, then thighs and 
  cutting them free where they meet the body, then cut the tendons to free 
  the joint. The joints are much tighter than on a chicken or turkey and 
  take some effort to dislodge and cut free.</li>
<li>When cutting from the body the meat clings hard to the bones and the 
  bone structure is convoluted and the whole thing is dark which makes it 
  more difficult to see what you're doing. Use a small sharp boning knife, 
  not a carving knife.</li>
<li>Cut the breasts away from the breastbone (if you haven't already 
  removed it). You'll find the keel is very shallow and the bone nearly 
  horizontal which makes this a little more difficult than with chicken. 
  Once you have the breasts off you're about done - there's just a 
  little more meat for picking off the body.</li>
<li>Once you've disassembled your duck you can slice the breasts - and do 
  slice fairly thin because duck is chewier than turkey. A thin razor 
  sharp santoku is a much better tool for this than a conventional 
  slicing knife. The flesh is firm and will slice well without breaking 
  up. The "tenderloin" under the main breast will come completely loose 
  - it has almost no adhesion.</li> 
<li>The second joint of the wing is so small it isn't worth separating 
  the wing into two pieces.</li>
<li>Once you've got it all sliced up, arrange the slices on a platter, 
  perhaps roughly in the form of the duck as shown in the photo.</li>
<li>If you wish you can debone the legs and thighs. The legs don't have 
  tendon problems like turkey so they debone quite easily.</li>
<li>Unlike chicken or turkey, it matters little which parts go to whom. 
  There's no white meat and all parts taste pretty much the same - but 
  duck is chewier so wings and legs should not go to people with bad 
  teeth.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Chinese Way:</h2>
<p>Bones are not removed - the Chinese are certain meat on the bone is 
juicier. Remove the leg-thigh pieces and wings as noted above. Cut away 
the back from the breast side - this is best done with your kitchen 
shears.</p>
<p>Chop breasts, legs, thighs and wing joints into slices, generally 
1-1/2 inches wide and maybe a bit thinner for the breast. This chopping 
is best done with a razor sharp Chinese cleaver.</p>
<p>You're probably not a Chinese chef born with a cleaver knife in your 
hand, so don't try to do this free-hand. Carefully position the sharp 
edge of the knife at the point you want to cut, then drive the cleaver 
knife through with a blow from a soft faced mallet (plastic, wood or 
hard rubber). Preferably drive it through with a single blow to minimize 
bone splinters.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="safety" class=lrg>Safety Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be prepared to handle dangerous quantities of very hot oil. The 
roasting pan must always be handled with great care lest it spill. Safe 
and proper basting tools should be used.</li>
<li>Observe cooking temperatures given above and take them seriously. 
Harmful bacteria multiply very rapidly at temperatures between 40&deg;F 
and 140&deg;F, a range your duck will be in for most of the cooking time.
</li>
<li>Do not let an uncooked duck come in contact with any other food.</li>
<li>When handling an uncooked duck, do not handle any other food until 
you have cleaned up all surfaces, tools and your hands, preferably using 
a little bleach or a mildly disinfecting cleanser.</li>
<li>The USDA recommends that leftovers should be in the refrigerator 
within 2 hours of coming out of the oven. In general, that's just not 
going to happen, but try to keep close. If there are large amounts store 
in multiple smaller batches so the temperature will drop quickly.</li>
