<span class=bg>
It is necessary to scald a duck to open pores in the skin so the fat will 
escape during roasting. The skin will become tight and swolen during this 
process.</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>
The method shown here is Chinese, lowering the duck into a wok (or in 
this case an Indian kadhai which is deeper) of boiling water and ladling 
the water over the exposed parts of the duck for about 5 minutes.
</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>
The French method, used through Europe and North America, is to put 
the duck in the sink and pour boiling water over it. It's done this way 
because the French don't have woks.</span>
