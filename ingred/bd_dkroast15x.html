I've read that Chinese gourmets say the most delectible part of a duck is 
the tail. Chefs strongly disagree and say to discard the tail. I find that 
with the oil glands properly removed the tail is just fine, but there's not 
a lot to eat there.</span>

<span class=bg>
The wishbone on a duck or goose is heavier and positioned differently from 
that of a chicken or turkey. It is usually removed to give the front of the 
bird a smoother appearance and to make slicing easier after roasting.

<span class=bg>Just push the breast skin back and use a boning knife to 
cut around the top and sides, then pull out forward and cut it free at 
the ends.</span>
