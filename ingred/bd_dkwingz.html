<h1>Duck Wings</h1>

Duck wings are plentiful in markets serving a Chinese or Southeast Asian 
community, and fairly inexpensive.  They are very much like chicken wings 
but larger, the tip joint is much longer, and they are almost completely 
devoid of fat. They are much used as appetizers in the same manner as 
chicken wings but must be cooked considerably longer. Duck wings weigh 
about 4.6 ounces each.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find them in markets serving a Chinese or 
Southeast Asian community.  They are sold whole and as "drumettes" 
(largest joint only). Whole wings are sold in trays weighing about 
2 pounds at about US $1.49/pound.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Follow the recipe, or use as for chicken wings, 
but cook at least twice as long. You can use them to make
