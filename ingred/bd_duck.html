"Duck" is a rather imprecise term covering a number of subfamilies of the 
water bird family <i>Anatidae</i> - basically all those that are not either 
geese (subfamily <i>Anserinae</i> tribe <i>Anserini</i>) or swans (subfamily 
<i>Anserinae</i> genus <i>Cygnus</i>). The photo is of a Mandarin Duck, 
generally raised as a decorative rather than for food.

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>It's hard to generalize about ducks in general - except that some of 
the many species populate every continent except Antarctica, and get 
pretty close to there too. For domestic ducks, though, it's easier to 
generalize - because all except the Muscovy were developed from the wild 
Mallard, regardless of current size, shape, color or disposition.</p>

<p>Male ducks are often decked out in very fancy colors, but females are, 
due to their nest tending needs, dressed in dull brown camouflage. Male 
ducks take no part in hatching eggs or tending the young.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="size" class=lrg>Types, Sizes <small>&</small> Uses</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Mallard</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkmallard01e.jpg" alt="Mallard Duck" class=mrg>
[Wild Duck, <i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>]
<p>Nearly all domestic ducks were derived from the wild Mallard, but 
unlike them the Mallard is relatively small (not much over 2-1/2 pounds) 
and a strong flyer. The photo shows the typical male coloration. There 
has recently been some effort to farm mallards, but the commercial 
potential is still unknown and depends on public acceptance. Will people 
(mainly chefs) pay more for wilder tasting duck?

<h2 id=pekin>White Pekin Duck</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <h3>Long Island Duck</h3>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkpekin01h.jpg" alt="Pekin Duck" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Anas platyrhynchos domestica</i>]
</p><p>
This duck, developed in China, accounts for about 95% of the ducks eaten in 
North America. They are also known as Long Island Ducks because some were 
brought there from China in 1873 to establish commercial duck farms. Flavor 
is mild and flesh is relatively low in fat. They are killed at about 7 weeks 
when they weigh about 7 pounds. White ducks are preferred for meat (as are 
white chickens) because they look clean after plucking.</p>
<p>European Pekins are rather different from the North American variety and 
walk quite upright, though not as upright as an Indian Runner.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Muscovy Duck</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkmusc01e.jpg" alt="Muskovy Duck" class=mrg>
[<i>Cairina moschata</i>]
<p>
Native to Brazil, this is the only domesticated duck that isn't 
derived from Mallard stock. Muskovys account for about 2% to 3% of the North 
American market. They are sold mainly into the restaurant trade where their 
large breasts are appreciated.  Their meat is relatively low in fat and has 
been described as more like veal than like poultry. Muscovy livers are also 
used to make foie gras.</p>
<p>These are large ducks with the males reaching over 15 pounds 
and females can be as heavy as 9 pounds. They are generally killed at 11 
weeks when the breasts have reached a mature size. The individual in the 
photo has a black face but they more commonly have red faces. Muscovys don't 
swim much because they have deficient oil glands, but they can fly, and are 
the only domestic duck that roosts on branches at night like a chicken.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rouen Duck</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkrouen02h.jpg" alt="Rouen Hen" class=mrg>
[Giant Mallard]
<p>
This duck looks very much like a Mallard that's just way too fat to fly 
(see Mallard above for male coloration). Show birds grow as large as 12 pounds 
but production varieties are considerably smaller. They are highly thought of 
as meat ducks in Europe so some are grown in North America, mainly for the 
restaurant trade. Its popularity is increasing because its meat is even 
less fatty than that of the Pekin, but it is a relatively expensive duck 
to grow compared to the Pekin.

<h2>Indian Runner Duck</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkrun02h.jpg" alt="Runner Ducks" class=mrg>
Developed in India, this is the premier egg laying duck. A hen will lay 
around 300 eggs a year, twice what most ducks lay, and has little interest 
in hatching them. Runners are easily recognizable on land because they 
stand almost straight upright. They have been described as looking like a 
bowling pin with feet, but they look much more normal floating.<p></p>
<p>The photo specimens are the "fawn and white" variety, but there are 
white and penciled (whatever that means) varieties. It's main competitor 
is the related Khaki Campbell which is an even better egg layer but is 
still not common. Thin and tough, runners are not desirable as meat ducks.

<h3>Duck Eggs - Fresh</h3>
<p>These are now produced in quantity in California and are in good 
supply in the Asian markets. When buying, just make sure you're getting 
fresh eggs, not salted - read the label. In California salted eggs are 
not dyed red, and Balut look like fresh eggs too.

<h3>Duck Eggs - Salted:</h3> 
<p>These are now produced in quantity in 
California and in good supply in the Asian markets. When buying, just make 
sure you're getting salted eggs, not raw - read the label. Some Asian 
producers dye the salted eggs red or package them in red shrink-wrap - 
but California producers don't.

<h3>Duck Eggs - Preserved:</h3> &nbsp; The mysterious dark amber jell in 
some Chinese pastries many Americans have encountered without knowing 
what it was. Fourty years ago these were shipped over her in great 
ceramic jars packed in rice straw and ashes, but are today sent over 
by the container load, cleaned and put up in foam plastic trays.

<b>Duck Eggs - Feathered / Balut</b> &nbsp; You'd probably really rather not know, 
but these are eggs incubated 16 days to develop the embryo. Much eaten as 
an "appetizer" in China, Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia. They are now 
produced in California to meet demand from our Asian communities and can 
be ordered on-line. They are available over the counter from some 
Chinese / Southeast Asian markets, and in Philippine markets.
