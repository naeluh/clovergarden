<h1>Working <small>with</small> Ducks</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
There are significant structural differences between ducks and land 
birds like chickens and turkeys. There is also the matter of fat, which is 
very important to the duck, serving as insulation, flotation, energy supply 
and oil to waterproof its feathers. Fortunately it's a prized cooking fat 
so it need not be resented.

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>Facts <small>&amp;</small> Comparison 
<small>to</small> Chicken</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Size:</b> &nbsp; While chickens come in a wide range of sizes for 
  different purposes, ducks are nearly all sold between 4 and 5-1/2 pounds. 
  This is, however, a convenient size for most recipes.</li>
<li><b>Fat:</b> &nbsp; Ducks carry a very large amount of fat compared to 
  chickens, but unlike chicken nearly all the fat is firmly attached to 
  the skin and comes off with it. On the plus side, duck fat is considered 
  one of the finest cooking fats, so render it all out for cooking.
  <br><u>Caution</u>: duck fat will turn rancid fairly quickly even if 
  frozen, so do not keep frozen duck or duck fat more than a couple 
  months.</li>
<li><b>Meat:</b> &nbsp; It's all dark meat - there's no pale dry 
  cardboard-like  breast meat like on chicken. The meat is also 
  relatively tough, making for longer cooking times, and it's relatively 
  oily, so you don't have to worry about it drying out - but you may 
  have to skim fat out of recipes.</li>
<li><b>Breast:</b> &nbsp; Duck breasts are wide and flat, and not nearly 
  as thick as chicken. The breastbone is very wide and has only a low 
  keel. The skin over the breasts has a very thick layer of fat. Breasts 
  are almost always used skin-on, the fat becoming part of the recipe. 
  Breasts are very scarce in markets because almost all are sold to the 
  restaurant trade. You'll usually have to buy a whole duck and have a 
  plan to use the rest of the bird.</li>
<li><b>Legs &amp; Thighs:</b> &nbsp; Duck legs are shorter than chicken 
  legs and the thighs aren't large enough to sell as a separate product, 
  so they're packaged together. They are harder to skin than chicken 
  because the skin doesn't just peel off, you have to carefully cut it 
  off, and they're harder to disjoint.</li>
<li><b>Wings:</b> &nbsp; These are similar to chicken wings but larger 
  and with a deeper flavor. The tip joint is longer and without meat so 
  it's used for making stock.</li>
<li><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; It's relatively tough compared to chicken skin 
  and remains a bit chewy if fried or roasted. It has a relatively thick 
  layer of fat under it, particularly at the breasts, but almost none on 
  wings and legs. It adheres much more strongly than chicken skin so has 
  to be carefully cut away with a sharp knife rather than just being 
  pulled off.</li>
<li><b>Giblets:</b> &nbsp; Neck, gizzard, heart and liver should be 
  included in any whole duck, but don't count on it - what you actually 
  get can be pretty random - and there may be some unexpected parts in 
  there too. Duck gizzards differ in both flavor and texture from chicken 
  gizzards and are highly prized in France and Asia. They can be 
  purchased in trays in Asian markets - see our 
  <a href="bd_dkgizz.html"><b>Duck Gizzard</b></a> page for details. 
  Duck livers are prized by chefs and food processors for making 
  p&acirc;t&eacute;s so are very scarce in the markets. Necks are also 
  sold separately in trays and are excellent for making duck soup stock.
  </li>
<li><b>Bones &amp;  Cartilage:</b> &nbsp; Duck bones are very hard, they 
  practically ring if you drop them on a hard surface. There is very 
  little cartilage even in the joints.</li>
<li><b>Oil Gland:</b> &nbsp; Ducks have an oil gland at the top of the 
  tail which has a bad flavor. Commercial ducks have this removed but if 
  you're doing your own duck be sure to cut it off thoroughly.</li>
<li><b>Cooking Time:</b> &nbsp; Duck meat takes a much longer cooking 
  time than chicken - for thin slices of meat an hour. For whole wing 
  joints, about 2 hours at a slow simmer, 2-1/2 hours for legs.</li>
<li><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Duck bones and offcuts make an excellent 
  flavorful stock, but it won't be as clear as chicken stock. You need 
  to simmer duck a whole lot longer - use beef timing rather than chicken 
  timing. In Asian markets you can often find trays of duck necks which 
  make excellent stock.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2 id="yield" class=lrg>Yields</h2>

<p>Weights given are for raw meat. After simmering to tenderness meat will 
be about <b>58%</b> of the raw weight, which is a little lower than for 
chicken. The lost weight becomes part of, and flavors, the cooking liquid.</p>

<h2 id="notes" class=lrg>Notes & Safety</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Thawing:</h3> &nbsp;  Yes, all the books, recipes, cooking 
  articles and "experts" scream <h3><i>"Never Do This!"</i></h3> but 
  even the rabid bacteriophobes at the USDA (U.S. Department of 
  Agriculture) say it's OK. Actual research has proven a cool countertop 
  or cold running water thaw is less risky (on multiple counts) than 
  thawing in the refrigerator, and far  easier to time. The "Never Do 
  This" recommendation is based on an FDA decree that has no research 
  whatever to support it. If you find you just won't be ready by time 
  it's thawed, put it back in the fridge <u>before</u> it is completely 
  thawed - and make sure it can't contact or drip on anything else.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Final Temperature:</h3> &nbsp; Yes your thermometers and many of 
  your books and recipes say fowl must go to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C - based 
  on an FDA recommendation. That recommendation was reviewed in 2006 and 
  the FDA could find no supporting data whatever, not even scribbled 
  notes, to support the ruinous 180&deg;F recommendation, and now agrees 
  with the USDA that 165&deg;F/74&deg;C is perfectly safe.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Hot Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Be prepared to handle dangerous quantities 
  of very hot oil. The roasting pan must always be handled with great 
  care lest it spill. Safe and proper basting tools should be used.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Temperature:</h3> &nbsp; Observe cooking temperatures given 
  above and take them seriously. Harmful bacteria multiply very rapidly 
  at temperatures between 40&deg;F and 140&deg;F, a range your duck 
  will be in for most of the cooking time. The 165&deg;F/74&deg;C will 
  assure all bacteria are dead.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Contact:</h3> &nbsp; Do not let an uncooked duck come in contact 
  with or drip on any other food, inside the refrigerator or out.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Handling:</h3> &nbsp; When handling an uncooked duck, do not 
  handle any other food until you have cleaned up all surfaces, tools 
  and your hands, preferably using a little bleach or a mildly 
  disinfecting cleanser.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Leftovers</h3> &nbsp; The USDA recommends that leftovers should 
  be in the refrigerator within 2 hours of coming out of the oven. In 
  general, that's just not going to happen, but try to keep close. If 
  there are large amounts store in multiple smaller batches so the 
  temperature will drop quickly.</li>
