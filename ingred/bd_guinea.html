<h1>Guineafowl</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
[Family <i>Numididae</i>]
<p>Guineafowl are native to Africa, and appear to be the oldest extant family 
of <i>Galiforms</i> (Chicken-like birds). There are four genera of guineafowl 
running wild in Africa, but the domesticated guinaefowl are all derived from 
the Helmeted Guineafowl <i>Numida meleagris</i>. The photo shows free range 
Helmeted Guineafowl in Namibia, Africa.	All genera of Guineafowl are  IUCN 
rated LC (Least Concern) except the White-Breasted which lives in the forests 
of western West Africa which is IUCN VU (Vulnerable).

<h2>Domestic Helmeted Guineafowl</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_guinh02e.jpg" alt="Domestic Helmeted Guineafowl" class=mrg>
<p>[Pintade, Pearl Hen, Gleany ; <i>Numida meleagris</i>]</p>
<p>The Helmeted Guineafowl is native to most of Sub Saharan Africa, but 
prefers open savanna, so avoids the Congo region and some costal regions. 
When the domesticated variety was developed is unknown, but there is evidence 
they were being kept in Greece by 500 BCE. They have since been introduced 
to regions of Africa they did not naturally inhabit, and have been introduced 
within Europe, India, North Americas, Australia, and the West Indies. As with 
Chickens, hobby breeders have developed varieties of various colorations and 
patterns, including pearl gray and lavender.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These birds are locally and sporadically available in 
North America, and available from on-line specialists like  D'Artagnan, if 
you can afford their prices and the cost of express shipping. Weight of 
dressed whole birds is about 2-3/4 pounds (1-1/4 kg). <u>Subst</u>: Free 
Range Chicken. If not Free Range, then definitely, just thigh and leg meat.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are cooked the same as Free Range Chicken, 
but they will be a bit tougher, so somewhat longer cooking time. <p></p>


<h2>Black Guineafowl</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_guinb01e.jpg" alt="Black Guineafowl" class=mrg>
[<i>Agelastes niger</i>]
<p>The Black Guineafowl is not a domesticated species, but it is actively 
hunted for food in it's range, especially in West Central Africa. It has 
the second widest distribution, after the Helmeted Guineafowl, and occupies 
regions that bird avoids. It is found in humid forests from  Nigeria and 
Cameroon down through West Central Africa through the Congo region and 
into Angola. Their numbers are declining due to over hunting and habitat 
degradation, but are still common and IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).
