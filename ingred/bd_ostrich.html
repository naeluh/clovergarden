[Ostrich <i>Struthio camelus</i> of family <i>Struthionidae</i> &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; Emu <i>Dromaius novaehollandiae</i> of family <i>Dromaiidae</i>]
<p>
Ostrich has often been described as "the meat of the future", because it 
looks and tastes similar to beef, but is very low in both fat and 
cholesterol. There is a problem though - price.  It is often said that 
as production ramps up, the price will come down, but, due to the nature 
of the beast, and problems encountered in raising it and preparing it 
for market, the potential for price reduction is limited. This is a wild 
animal, not one that has been domesticated and carefully bred for 10,000 
years.</p>
<p>Price also limits ramping up production - an ostrich and egg problem. 
A market certainly does exist, though the prices it will currently pay 
provide marginal profit. One factor that partially offsets the problems 
is that ostrich skin is highly valued for high end leather goods due to 
it's attractive pattern. The feathers are also sellable, as are empty 
egg shells.

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>General and History</h2>

<p>Ostriches, native to Africa, can grow to as much as 350 pounds and 
9 feet tall. Emus, native to Australia, are smaller, growing only to 
130 pounds or so. Unfortunately, much larger birds (up to about 880 
pounds and over 12 feet tall) were hunted to extinction by the natives 
of Madagascar and New Zealand between 1500 and 1700.</p>

<p>Ostrich and Emus have wings that are small and weak and have no breast 
bone keel to attach strong breast muscles to. This does not mean the 
wings are useless, they are very important. Cheetahs are the most 
dangerous predator for ostriches. An ostrich can run about 45 miles 
per hour, but cheetahs are considerably faster - yet their kill ratio is 
low. In a pursuit, as the cheetah closes in, the ostrich will spread 
its wings and uses them as airfoils to execute a turn too sharp for the 
cheetah to follow. Cheetahs have only short endurance at speed, and the 
chase is often over. Other predators rely on ambush because they can't 
run fast enough, but ostriches have been known to kill lions with a 
single kick.</p>

<p>
<p>Ostrich farming has been a very uncertain business. In most places it 
has been a sort of pyramid scheme, with the early entries making a huge 
amount of money selling breeding pairs at high prices. Once the market 
for breeders is saturated, most farms go out of business.  Namibia, 
Brazil and Israel invested very heavily in ostrich farming, and crashed 
out on grounds of profitability - and in Israel ostrich and crocodile 
are now illegal to farm - not kosher.</p>

<p>South Africa has been the largest producer since the late 1800s, and 
has plenty of low cost labor available, but even there it's been up and 
down. In 1990 there were over a million ostriches on South African farms, 
and in 2012, 250,000, with the industry threatened by extinction from bird 
flu (not the deadly Asian variety).</p>
<p>North America is a relatively stable producer, but again, relative 
to what? Australia went into ostriches in a big way back around 1990, 
but profitability has been highly ellusive and most smaller operators are 
gone. Remaining operators have shifted to optimizing for hides rather than 
meat.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking Ostrich <small>&amp;</small> Emu</h2>

<p>While Ostrich may look and taste a lot like beef, its lack of fat 
makes it quite different for cooking.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Thigh Cuts:</b> &nbsp; These need to be cooked over high 
    heat, very quickly, preferably to medium rare - medium is risky and 
    beyond that it is ruined. On the plus side, a patty of ground ostrich 
    will have very little shrink during cooking - again because of the 
    lack of fat. Because of the quick cooking, ostrich cuts are usually 
    sliced fairly thin for grilling, broiling or pan frying. Thigh cuts 
    are also good cut into strips and used for stir fry dishes, and cubed 
    for kebabs. For stir fries, fry stirring only until the raw color 
    is gone, then remove and set aside. When everything else is done, 
    stir the meat back in until warmed through and serve.</li>
  <li><b>Drum Cuts:</b> &nbsp; The legs provide the toughest cuts and are 
    best used for slow cooking with plenty of liquid, in soups and stews. 
    The Drum Fillet is a bit less tough than the Inside Drum and 
    Outside Drum.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

<img src="img/bd_ostrc03e.gif" alt="Chart" class=mrg></a>
These birds are not parted out into whole joints as turkeys are, because 
of size. A 6 pound drumstick is just a little too big for the plate. 
Instead, these birds are disassembled into separate muscles. This 
increases the cost of processing, you can't just dump the bird in a 
shrink bag and send it to the market. It does make cooking more 
convenient, as there are no bones to deal with at the consumer level.
</p>
<p>A significant amount of meat cannot be recovered as cuts, so it is 
used to produce ground ostrich meat and ostrich sausages, which sell 
at a significantly lower price per pound than the cuts.</p>
<p>At this time, naming of the cuts is not well standardized, and 
differs some among North America, Australia and South Africa.

There are two significant cuts near the thigh, but the rest of the 
forequarter has little meat, though people who have access to whole 
forequarters do roast them and pick off the meat there is.</td></tr>

<tr>

<tr><td><b>Wing<br>Drumette</b>
  </td>
  <td><img src="img/bd_ostrcwd03n.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>
  The wing drumette has little recoverable meat on it and is seldom sold 
  as a retail cut.   The ostrich / emu breastbone is flat and unsuitable 
  for attachment of strong wing muscles.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Neck</b>
  </td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/bd_ostrcnk03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>

<table class=tbl>
<tr><th id="thigh"><span class=tf>Thigh</span></th><td>
The thigh, located at the top front of the hindquarter, is the meatiest 
part of the bird, containing a number of substantial muscles suitable 
for slicing into steaks. These cuts are more tender than those of the 
Drum, but overcooking must be carefully avoided.
</td></tr>

  <td class=nw><b>Pearl<br>Round</b></td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/bd_ostrcpl03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>
  This is a substantial cut from the center of the thigh, weighing about 
  9-1/2 ounces. This cut is often cut into steaks for pan frying or 
  quick roasting.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td class=nw><b>Fan</b>
  </td>
  <td><img src="img/bd_ostrcfn03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>

  <td class=nw><b>Tenderloin</b></td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/bd_ostrctl03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>
  This is a substantial cut from the bottom of the hindquarter, and is 
  sufficient for slicing into steaks. It weighs about 1-7/8 pounds for 
  ostrich.

<table class=tbl>
<tr><th id="drum"><span class=tf>Drum</span></th><td>
Weighing about 6 pounds, ostrich drumsticks are too large for the plate 
and are separated into individual muscles. Tendons and tough membranes 
must be removed before cooking, and these tough cuts are better for 
long wet cooking than for frying, grilling or broiling.
</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td class=nw><b>Drum,<br> Outer</b></td>
  <td>
  <img src="img/bd_ostrcdo03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>

<tr><td class=nw><b>Drum,<br>Fillet</b>
  </td>
  <td><img src="img/bd_ostrcdf03m.gif" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>
  This is the muscle at the front of the leg which draws the leg forward. 
  as with other animals, it is more tender than the muscles that drive 
  the leg back, but it's still not real tender. It weighs about 1-1/4 
  pounds for ostrich.

Unfortunately, an ostrich or emu carcass does not divide completely 
into neat "cuts". There is a lot of miscellaneous meat that can only 
be ground up for use.
</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td class=nw><b>Ground Ostrich</b></td>
  <td>
  A fair amount of ground ostrich is generated from each bird dismantled, 
  and this can be purchased as bulk ground or as formed hamburger patties. 
  The price per pound is substantially less than for the coherent cuts.
  These must not be overcooked, but they exhibit much less shrink than 
  beef patties.   
  </td></tr>
  <tr>
  <td class=nw><b>Sausage</b></td>
  <td>
  These are available in a number of forms, including ostrich hot dogs 
  (which may be 100% ostrich or include some beef and pork, depending 
  on manufacturer). They are not as low cost as ground ostrich but are 
  still substantially less than the coherent cuts.
  </td></tr>

<table class=tbl>
<tr><th id="eggs"><span class=tf>Eggs</span></th><td>
As fitting for such large birds, their eggs are very large, but are not 
as large in proportion to body size as for other birds. They can, of 
course, be cooked, but are most valuable empty, for sale to crafts people 
who carve them in various designs.
