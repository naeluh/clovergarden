[<i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i>]
<p>
<span class=bg>Velociraptors</span> were small 
feathered dinosaurs belonging to the family <i>Dromaeosauridae</i> of the 
suborder <i>Theropoda</i>, the same suborder from which birds evolved. 
They lived between 70 and 83 million years ago and were about the size of 
a large modern Thanksgiving turkey, something like 33 pounds, but a lot 
slimmer and well toned. The tail was rigid vertically, but flexible 
horizontally to aid in tight turns at high speed. While velociraptor did 
not fly, some of its direct ancestors possibly did - the evidence is 
scars on the arm bones for anchoring flight feathers. The wings did 
make velociraptor a fearsome predator, contributing to tight turns at 
high speed and the ability to run up steep slopes. &nbsp;

<p>The velociraptors in the novel and movie "Jurassic Park" were clearly 
"conceptualized" for effect and do not resemble the real velociraptor in 
size nor did they have feathers - and real ones probably didn't hunt 
in packs. On the other hand, regardless of size, I don't think you'd want 
to meet up with a hungry one. We have good evidence those nasty hooks on 
the front of the feet were used to rip into the throats of victims - and 
they were very fast.</p>
