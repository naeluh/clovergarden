<h1>Bellflowers</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg>Bellflowers</span> (family <i>Campanulaceae</i>) are a 
modest size family with worldwide distribution. Most have bell shaped 
flowers hanging as a bell would, but not all, as witness the Chinese 
Bellflowers in the photo. Many are popular decoratives and several have 
medicinal uses but only a few have culinary applications.

<h2>Chinese Bellflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/bellflower23h.jpg" alt="Chinese Bellflower Root shreds" class=mrg>
[Japanese Bellflower, Balloon Flower; Do-ra-ji (Korea); 
<i>Platycodon grandiflorus</i>]
<p>
Native to Northeast Asia (China, East Siberia, Korea and Japan) the root 
of this plant has long been used as an anti-inflammatory in China, but in 
Korea the root is popular in salads and in herbal cooking.</p>
<p>So far I've found it only in the dried form shown in the photo, labeled 
Bellflower or Platycodon depending on brand. The specimens were obtained 
from a local Korean market.<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Codonopsis</h2>
<br><img src="img/bellflower20h.jpg" alt="Dried Roots" class=mrg>
[Bonnet Bellflower; Todok (Korea); <i>Codonopsis lanceolata</i>]
<p>
Native to the edges of moist forests in East Asia, the root of this 
plant is used in cooking from Malaysia to Korea. The photo specimens were 
purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles, packaged in a plastic bag.</p>
<p>In Korea Codonopsis is called Todok and is popular cooked fresh as a 
vegetable but fresh Todok isn't common here. The dried root should be soaked 
in warm salted water to soften it and draw out any bitterness. Slices such as 
are shown in the photo will take well over an hour of soaking time. Todok 
remains fairly firm and is somewhat fiberous so always cut crosswise and 
fairly thin.</p>
<p><u>Subst:</u> &nbsp; Celery root is most similar in texture though 
different in flavor. Parsnip is way too sweet and gets way too soft.</p>
<p>This root, thought to have anti-cancer properties, is also reputed to 
be an aphrodesiac tonic and is used medicinally to treat inflamation. 
Another colonopsis species, <i>Codonopsis pilosula</i>, is important in 
Chinese herbal medicine but not for cooking.

<h2>Rampion Bellflower</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bellflower29h.jpg" alt="Flowers" class=mrg>
[Rover Bellflower; <i>Campanula rapunculus</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to Western Asia, North Africa and most of 
Europe. It is absent from Ireland, Iceland and Norway, but has been 
introduced to Denmark, southern Sweeden and England. It was formerly 
widely cultivated in Europe for its spinach like leaves and its roots, 
which were used like radishes.

<h2>Serbian Bellflower</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bellflower27h.jpg" alt="Flowers" class=mrg>
[Trailing Bellflower; <i>Campanula poscharskyana</i>]
<p>
Native to the Dinaric Alps along the Balkan west coast, the leaves 
of this plant are edible year round and used in salads.
