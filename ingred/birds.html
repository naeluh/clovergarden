<p>
Birds (class <i>Avis</i>) are a branch of the Dinosaurs that has 
survived into our era - their closest living relatives are the 
Crocodiles. Some birds have been pretty fearsome too - flightless but fast 
running predators 12 feet tall with hooked flesh shredding beaks and eagles 
with 20 foot wingspans. They make today's birds look pretty tame, but I 
still wouldn't want to get an eagle really pissed off at me or get kicked 
by an emu. <small>Photo of Eclectus Parrots, green male and red female,

<p>Wild birds no longer appear on our tables much because domesticated 
birds have long been bred to be meatier, and because wild birds are rather 
hard to catch. In Italy and France, though, song birds are greatly prized 
by gourmets, probably an echo of the excesses of the Romans.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><a href="bd_velociz.html">
<img src="img/bd_veloci05e.jpg" alt="Velociraptor" class=mrg></a>
When did birds first appear? That depends on what you want to call a 
"bird". For certain <a href="bd_velociz.html"><b>Velociraptor</b></a> 
was feathered, including large quills anchored directly to the arm bones 
as modern birds that fly have, but I think few consider velociraptor a 
bird (wrong branch of <i>Theropoda</i> anyway). Even when birds could be 
said to fly depends on your definition of "fly".

<p>Proponents of "Intelligent Design" have argued birds cannot have 
evolved because only a fully developed wing is useful for flying, so 
intermediate stages make no sense and wings must have been designed. This 
has been shown completely false - non-flyable wings are highly useful. A 
study of immature chuckers (<a href="birds.html#b02">B2</a>) shows they flap their 
wings so as to create negative lift, forcing them towards the ground. 
This gives them improved traction allowing them to run up slopes so steep 
predators cannot follow. A nearly mature chucker can run straight up the 
trunk of a tree. When the wings are mature the chucker can flap them 
differently so as to create positive lift and fly.</p>

<p>Another example is the ostrich, which while fast can't outrun a 
cheetah, yet cheetahs rarely get to dine on ostrich. As the cheetah 
closes in the ostrich spreads its wings and uses them as airfoils to 
execute a turn the cheetah simply cannot follow, and soon becomes 
exhausted. So you can see that velociraptor, while tiny compared to the 
movie version, was a fearsome predator non-winged creatures would have 
difficulty escaping.</p>

Currently the earliest bird there is general agreement on is 
Archaeopteryx, of which 8 fossils have been found to date. This bird lived 
in the Jurassic, about 150 to 155 million years ago and was about 18 
inches long from nose to tail tip. It wasn't entirely "birdlike", having 
toothed jaws rather than a beak and a long bony tail and it wasn't a 
strong flyer but it could definitely fly. The photo shows a model 
reconstructed as best could be determined from the fossil evidence.

<p>So from all this you can see the transition from "dinosaur" to "bird" 
is a continuum and occurred over a fairly long period of time, possibly 
more than once. The exact lineage is still being debated, but in any case 
our Thanksgiving turkey does give us some idea what dinosaur might have 
tasted like.
