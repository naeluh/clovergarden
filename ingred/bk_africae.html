<h1>Bread <small>in</small> Africa</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>While domestication of grains for easy harvesting may 
have originated in Anatolia and Caucasus, about 10,000 years ago, the 
Horn of Africa was certainly not far behind. Grinding of grains into 
flour with sliding stones, and the baking of flat breads, is far older. 
Today, the main breads of Africa are still made under very primitive 
conditions. in a manner possibly in place before the dawn of history.

This is a popular bread in the Maghreb region, often eaten for 
breakfast with a mix of butter and honey, but also with jams. It is 
made from semolina or wheat flour.

<h3>Pita Bread</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Pita (Greek); Pocket 
  Bread; Pide (Turkey); Khubz Arabi (Arabic)]
<br><img src="img/bk_pita08e.jpg" alt="Disks of Pita" class=mrg>
<p>
This lightly leavened wheat bread is very popular throughout North 
Africa, and far beyond. The ethnic markets here in the Los Angeles 
region are piled high with pita, in both white (photo) and whole wheat 
versions, in the 7 inch and larger sizes.</p>
<p>The earliest Arabic recipes (10th century) have these baked in a 
Tandoor, but today they are usually made in continuous industrial  
ovens so as to meet the high demand. Pita is baked in a very hot oven at 
450&deg;F/232&deg;C or higher, causing the disk to puff up dramatically. 
When removed from the oven the disk collapses, but the two sides remain 
separated, so the bread can be opened into a pocket. Throughout the 
region, street foods of all kinds are packed into pita pockets.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was a 7 inch diameter disk 0.15 inch thick. Half 
the top layer was removed to show the inside. Enriched wheat flour, 
water, yeast, salt, calcium propionate.

Kisra Rhaheeefa is much like Ethiopia's <a href="bk_africae.html#inj"><b>Injera</b></a> 
and used similarly, but is made from Sorghum Flour or Wheat Flour rather 
than Teff. The "Kisra Rhaheeefa" name differentiates it from "Kisra 
Aseeda", which is a Sorghum Porridge.

<p>
This is the bread of Ethiopia and Eritrea, usually made from 
<a href="gr_teffz.html"><b>Teff</b></a>. It was traditionally, and 
is often still today, made very large, to fit the table for which it 
would be the tablecloth. Scoops of stews and other recipes are placed 
directly on it. Diners tear off pieces of the "tablecloth" and use them 
to pick up the food. Today, especially in restaurants it is often made 
smaller and served on an Indian thali, or a very large plate.

<p>This is a sour dough bread, made with a leavened batter similar to 
thin pancake batter. The batter is baked on a large clay or metal tray, 
over moderate heat, and on one side only. Bubbles on the top side burst, 
giving the bread a spongy texture, almost like honeycomb tripe, which 
is very good at holding sauces. Temperature is regulated so it sets 
through, but does not brown on the bottom (see the rolled examples in 
the photo at the top of the page). It can be made using white or brown 
Teff, or a mix. Farmers say the white Teff is preferred to the brown by 
most of their customers.

<p>This bread is popular in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen, but now also 
popular in Israel, introduced by Yemenite Jews. It is a fermented sour 
dough bread usually made of Sorghum Flour or Corn Flour and cooked on 
circular metal stove called a taawa or daawo. In Yemen, it is often 
served by street vendors.

<h3>Chapati</h3>
<br><img src="img/bk_afchap02e.jpg" alt="African Chapatis" class=mrg>
Long influenced by India, East Africa has adopted the Indian Chapati as 
their main form of bread - but they use white flour instead of the whole 
wheat Atta flour used in India. As it is very inconvenient for me 
to produce Chipatis, I use Flour Tortillas, easily available here in 
Southern California. I prefer the small 5 inch diameter ones. 
Incidentally, Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas make an excellent substitute 
for Indian Chapatis

South Sudan (Christian and Native Religion) is now a separate country 
from Sudan (all Muslim) and is moving strongly into the East African 
community. One thing they still have in common with Sudan is Sudan's
