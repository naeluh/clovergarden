<h1>Bread: &nbsp; Greece <small>to</small> Punjab</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>This region is large, but has a lot of consistency as 
far as bread is concerned. All through this region bread has an almost 
religious standing, and has supported the people since deep in prehistory. 
It includes the regions where grain agriculture and bread baking were 
originally developed. The baking oven used through this region is the 
Tandoor. Most breads from this region are quite thin because the extreme 
heat and vertical geometry of this oven make thicker loaves difficult.

<h2>Making Bread</h2>
<p></p> 

<h3>Tandoor</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tandoor (India); 
  Ton&eacute; (Georgia); Tonir (Armenia); Tannur (Arabic)]
<br><img src="img/tandoor02h.jpg" alt="Large Tandoor" class=mrg>
<p>
Clay and brick pit ovens have been used throughout the region of 
Anatolia, Caucasus, Western and Southern Asia for at least 5000 
years. The photo shows a bakery size oven in Georgia, but they come 
in many smaller sizes. They are usually quite deep, and at least 
partially embedded in the ground or a solid masonry structure. The 
internal temperature, fired by wood or charcoal, is normally well 
above 550&deg;F/290&deg;C, but usually is kept below 
800&deg;F/425&deg;C. Large bakery tandoors are now often gas fired. 
Bread is slapped on the wall of the tandoor where it sticks and bakes 
very quickly. It is then removed using a pole with a hook on it.

<p>In India, the Tandoor is a community or restaurant device due to 
the expense of building and operating it, but in Armenia, Georgia, and 
parts of Central Asia, traditional homes had at least a small one, 
usually in a shed separate from the house. Bread baked in a traditional 
Tandoor will be thicker on one side than the other, or stretched a bit 
due to drooping on the vertical surface. Here in Southern California, 
production bakeries have installed industrial tandoors which produce 
breads that are not curved, and are more even in thickness.

<h2>Varieties of Bread</h2>
<p></p>


<h3>Lavash</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [(Armenia); Lavashi 
  (Georgian)]
<br><img src="img/bk_lavash09d.jpg" alt="Sheet of Lavash" class=mrg>
This bread originated in Armenia, but is now much used also in Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran, Kashmir, and, of course, Southern California. 
It is fairly soft and very flexible as baked, making it excellent for 
wraps. It dries quickly, and in Armenia it is often dried and stacked 
for months until needed, then reconstituted by sprinkling with water. 
It also has many uses in the dried form.
<p>This bread is also made in whole wheat versions and in sizes much 
larger than the photo specimen. The photo specimen was 33-1/2 inches 
long, 12 inches wide and about 0.035 inch thick. The sheet weighed 
4-3/4 ounces. Flour, water, salt, yeast. 2013 US $1.99 / pound. The 
specimen was made by Colorado Quality Bakery. That's not the state 
Colorado, of course, but Colorado Boulevard in Glendale.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Matnakash</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Matnakash (Armenia)]
<br><img src="img/bk_matna02h.jpg" alt="Loaf of Matnakash" class=mrg>
<p>
This firm, yeast leavened bread is made throughout Armenia and Turkey, 
though in Turkey the inscribed pattern may be different. The photo 
specimen was 13 inches long, 9 inches wide and about 1-7/8 inches thick, 
weighing 1 pound 7 ounces. Flour, yeast, salt, water, made in Glendale, 
California.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Barbari Bread</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Nan-e Barbari 
(Persian)]
<br><img src="img/bk_barbar02e.jpg" alt="Loaf of Barbari" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the main bread of Persia (Iran). I suspect it has gone a bit 
north as well, because the Armenian bakeries in Glendale churn it out 
in quantity. The photo specimen was 22-1/2 inches long, 6-1/2 inches 
wide and 1-1/2 inches thick, weighing 1 pound 3 ounces. Unlike Matnakash 
it is usually sprinkled with sesame seeds. Flour, yeast, salt, water, 
sesame seeds.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Deda's Puri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Georgian; Mother's 
Dough (English)]
<br><img src="img/bk_pouri6h.jpg" alt="Loaf of Puri" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a very common bread in Georgia, where it would be baked in a 
tandoor oven. It always has the hole in the middle to keep it from 
puffing up too much (tandoors are very hot so browning is very fast and  
thick loaves wouldn't bake through). The crust is fairly soft. The photo 
specimen, baked in Glendale, of course, was 12 inches diameter, 1-7/8 
inches thick, and weighed 1-1/2 pounds. For serving it would be cut into 
slices about 1-1/2 inches thick.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Shotis Puri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Georgian; Shotti Bread 
(Glendale)]
<br><img src="img/bk_shotti02d.jpg" alt="Loaf of Shotti" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a very popular bread in Georgia, where it would be baked in a 
tandoor oven. It always has narrow "handles" at the ends and a depression 
in the center, but otherwise shape varies considerably from bakery to 
bakery. Length depends on the diameter of the tandoor, the larger the 
oven the longer the shotis that can be made in it. The shape results 
from the traditional method of forming the loaf. First it is pulled 
long, holding by the ends. Then it is patted out wide in the middle, 
and a depression is made in the center so it will not become too thick. 
It is stretched over a fabric covered form to aid in slapping it onto 
the hot wall of the tandoor. At a temperature of around 
350&deg;C/660&deg;F It browns in around 10 minutes and is fetched off 
the wall with a long hook and spatula. For serving, slices are cut 
about 1-1/2 inch thick.</p>
<p>In Glendale, California, it is made quite large, so as to be the 
standard 1 pound weight expected of breads here. Of course, made in 
Georgia it is smaller, much more rustic looking, and curved from the 
tandoor wall. The many Armenian bakeries here in Los Angeles County 
use industrial tandoors, so the size is not limited by oven diameter 
and the loaves are not curved. The photo specimen was 24-1/2 inches 
long, 6-1/2 inches across and 1-1/2 inches thick, with a thin, fairly 
soft crust. It was made by Glendale Fine Bakery: wheat flour (non GMO), 
yeast, salt, water.

<h3>Naan</h3> 
<br><img src="img/bk_naan09e.jpg" alt="Two Loaves of Naan" class=mrg>
This is a very popular lightly leavened Tandoori bread in northwest 
India, through Iran and on to the Caucasus. The photo specimen was 
made in Los Angeles, California, where it is available both fresh and 
frozen. We have a substantial South Asian population here and the ladies 
don't have the time or the communal Tandoor found in India, so they 
appreciate these.
<p>The loaf to the right in the photo was as purchased fresh, and the 
one to the left  I toasted it in my home Tandoor, consisting of a large 
ceramic floor tile in a 575&deg;F/300&deg;C oven. It was browned well in 
3 minutes. These measured 7 inches diameter by 0.4 inch thick and weighed 
2-7/8 ounces (after toasting). Enriched wheat flour, water, whole wheat 
flour, soybean oil and yeast.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Non - Uzbek</h3>
<br><img src="img/bk_uzbeknon02h.jpg" alt="Loaf of Uzbek Non Bread" class=mrg>
This is a tandoor baked bread that is extremely popular in Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. It is often more fancily decorated than the 
simple loaf in the photo, and can have an oil glaze on the top side. Non 
can also have onions, nigella, or other toppings spread on it before 
baking.

<h3>Maneesh</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Man'oushe, Za'atar Flatbread]
<br><img src="img/bk_manaesh01h.jpg" alt="Loaf of Maneesh Bread" class=mrg>
<p>
This bread is very popular in Lebanon. It is a loaf similar to Naan, 
coated with a Za'atar spice mix (za'atar (a kind of wild thyme), sumac 
and sesame seeds), then baked in an oven similar to a pizza oven. Other 
toppings may be added after it comes out of the oven.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pita Bread</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Pita (Greek); Pocket 
  Bread; Pide (Turkey); Khubz Arabi (Arabic)]
<br><img src="img/bk_pita08e.jpg" alt="Disks of Pita" class=mrg>
<p>
This lightly leavened wheat bread is popular in Greece, the Balkans, 
Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia, the Levant, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and 
the Northwest corner of India. The ethnic markets here in the Los 
Angeles region are piled high with pita, in both white (photo) and 
whole wheat versions, in the 7 inch and larger sizes.</p>
<p>The earliest Arabic recipes (10th century) have these baked in a 
Tandoor, but today they are usually made in continuous industrial  
ovens so as to meet the high demand. Pita is baked in a very hot oven at 
450&deg;F/232&deg;C or higher, causing the disk to puff up dramatically. 
When removed from the oven the disk collapses, but the two sides remain 
separated, so the bread can be opened into a pocket. Throughout the 
region, street foods of all kinds are packed into pita pockets.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was a 7 inch diameter disk 0.15 inch thick. Half 
the top layer was removed to show the inside. Enriched wheat flour, 
water, yeast, salt, calcium propionate.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pita Bread - Greek</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Pita (Greek)]
<br><img src="img/bk_gkpita01e.jpg" alt="Disks of Pita" class=mrg>
<p>
This bread does not have a pocket, in fact it is very much like the 
naan bread made by the same Armenian bakery, just a bit different in 
surface texture. It's probably made in the same continuous process 
"tandoor" the naan is made in. Of course, the earliest records of the 
baking of pita have it all made in a tandoor. These were 7-1/4 inch 
diameter, 0.32 inch thick and weighted 3-1/4 ounces each, made in 
California. Enriched wheat flour, water, soybean oil, yeast, 2% or less 
of whey, salt, sugar, dough conditioner, baking powder, sodium propionate.
