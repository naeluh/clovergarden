<h1>Breads <small>of </small> East <small>&amp;</small> Southeast Asia</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg> East and Southeast Asia are not regions that come readily 
to mind when you think of bread, but bread does have a presence there. 
In China, wheat was long considered a coarse grain for the poor, until 
grinding mills capable of grinding such hard grain into flour were 
imported from the Roman Empire. It then became very prestigious among 
royalty and the upper classes, but not for making the leavened breads 
of Europe. China lacked the high gluten wheat needed for that kind of 
bread, so wheat was used mainly for dumplings and the like until modern 
times.</span>

<h2>Vietnamese French Rolls</h2>

[Banh Mi (Wheat Bread)]
<p>Vietnam was long controlled by France, as part of French Indochina. 
Various items from the French cuisine were introduced to the region, 
and most disappeared immediately upon the end of Franc's Southeast Asian 
Empire. The major exception is the French Roll, absolutely essential for 
the justly famous <a href="../recipes/swx_banhmi1.html">
<b>Banh Mi - Vietnamese Sandwiches</b></a>.  Some Baguettes are also 
still popular in Vietnam.

<h2>Chinese Doughnut Stick</h2>
<br><img src="img/bk_quay01e.jpg" alt="Chinese Youtiao, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Youtiao (China); Ch&aacute;y Qu&acirc;y (Vietnam)]
<p>
These are very popular all over China and in Vietnam, especially for 
breakfast. They are soft, airy, and chewy. They are rarely made at home 
because it takes too many steps, too much time, and too much attention 
- and the the region is swarming with street vendors producing them 
in quantity. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) in a 13 ounce package for 2019 US 
$3.49. They are to be fried in oil at 350&deg;F/177&deg;C for 3 minutes, 
or heated in an oven at 350&deg;F/177&deg;C for 3 to 4 minutes. Ingred: 
flour, water, cottonseed oil, salt.
