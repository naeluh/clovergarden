<h1>Breads <small>of</small> India</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Bread in India is generally flat and thin. From pretty thin to very 
thin to extremely thin. This is because Indians traditionally don't have 
ovens, though a few in the cities have them today. Bread is baked 
either on a flat or almost flat pan or in a Tandoor. The tandoor is a 
kind of oven, but its extreme heat and vertical geometry are not 
conducive to thick loves.</span>

<h2 id="make">Making Bread</h2>

<p><img src="../ke/img/ke_tavalodge1h.jpg" alt="Tava and Comal" class=mrg>
<h3>Tava:</h3> &nbsp; In Indian homes, the Tava is the 
traditional surface on which flat bread is baked, sometimes simply 
placed over a bucket of hot charcoal. Our Tava (right in photo) is 
rather upscale with a machine formed bowl and riveted handle - common 
tavas are pounded by hand out of sheet metal and many lack a handle, 
being manipulated with tongs. The tava is not at all suited to our gas 
and electric stoves. Being concave they are unstable even on a gas 
stove, and must be used with a wok ring - they are pretty much impossible 
for electric stoves. In India they are often used convex side up, which 
is an even worse problem. I strongly recommend the Lodge 10-1/2 inch 
L90G3 round griddle (Mexican "Comal" - left in photo) - a great piece of 
hardware, perfect for dry roasting spices and also for heating or 
frying Indian flat breads (and Mexican tortillas).

<p><img src="../ke/img/ke_tandoor01h.jpg" alt="Tandoor Oven" class=mrg>
<h3>Tandoor:</h3> &nbsp; Leavened bread In India is baked in a 
Tandoor. Indian homes do not have a tandoor - it is too expensive both 
to build and operate. It is normally a community or commercial device. 
Naan bread is prepared at home and taken to a community or commercial 
Tandoor to be baked. Dough is slapped on the inside wall of the tandoor, 
where it sticks and bakes quickly at very high temperature. It is then 
retrieved with a hook. Naan bread baked in such an oven will be of 
uneven thickness and of a sort of teardrop shape. Here in California, 
production bakeries have designed continuous industrial tandoors which 
produce breads that are round and even in thickness.	Tandoor ovens are 
also much used in Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Pakistan.

<h2 id="var">Varieties of Bread</h2>

<h3>Chapati</h3> 
<br><img src="img/bk_chiptort02e.jpg" alt="Chapati &amp; Tortilla" class=mrg>
The Chapati, a variety of Roti (round flat bread), made from a whole 
wheat flour called Atta, is the mainstay of bread in India. In the North, 
it is served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Traditionally, a servant 
would be making these fresh, continuously during meals, or in poorer 
households, it would be the wife's duty. It would be simply unthinkable 
to buy them. Here in Southern California we have a bit of a servant 
problem - no servants - and Indian wives here have caught this 
"liberation" bug. Chapatis are now produced here in bakeries, packaged 
and sold in Indian and some other markets, needing only warming. The 
photo specimens were 7-3/8 inches diameter 0.050 inches thick and 
weighed 1-5/8 ounces each. Made in California: wheat flour, water, 
vegetable oil, yeast, salt, calcium propionate. Some are of a lighter 
color than those in the photo - depends on the flour.
<p><b>Subst:</b> Whole wheat Tortillas are a dead ringer for 
Chapatis. In the photo, the roti to the left is actually a chapati 
obtained from an Indian market in Artesia. The one on the right is a 
whole wheat tortilla, obtained from a local multi-ethnic market. They 
look exactly the same, and they taste the same too. This is only logical 
- they're made from the same stuff, whole wheat flour, and the chipatis 
are made on easily available tortilla making equipment. Incidentally, 
for those who still want to make them at home, Indian markets here now 
sell tortilla presses to make it much easier than rolling them out.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Naan Bread</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tandoori Roti]
<br><img src="img/bk_indnaan04e.jpg" alt="Two Loaves of Naan" class=mrg>
This is the main leavened bread of India. It is traditionally made with 
yeast and white flour, and baked in a Tandoor oven (see top of page). If 
made in the traditional tandoor, the loaf will be tear shaped, due to 
drooping a bit after being slapped on the inside wall of the oven. They 
will also have one or more holes from being hooked out of the oven. The 
photo specimens, purchased at a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles, 
were made in Pakistan and shipped frozen. They were about 7 inches wide,  
8 inches high and roughly 0.3 inch thick, weighing 3 ounces. Wheat flour, 
water, canola oil, salt, baking soda.
<p>Here in Southern California, naan bakers use continuous process 
industrial "tandoors", so the breads are round and without holes, but 
otherwise pretty much the same. Naan bread can usually be found in the 
freezer cases of markets serving an Armenian, Indian or Pakistani 
community. They just need heating up on a grill, grill pan or oven 
(400&deg;F/200&deg;C for about 1-1/2 minutes). Hot naan bread is often 
brushed with butter for serving.</p>
<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; I have purchased Greek style pita bread (the 
non-pocketed style) and found it essentially identical - not surprising 
since that bread was made by an Armenian bakery that also makes naan 
bread (tandoors, called "tonir" are much used in Armenia). Regular pita 
bread wouldn't be as similar, but if a moderately puffy variety, it can 
serve. Small bare pizza shells would also be similar.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Paratha</h3> 
<br><img src="img/bk_indparath02h.jpg" alt="Disk of Partha" class=mrg>
Very popular in northern India, this flat bread is made quite differently 
from other Indian flat breads. It is actually made like puff pastry, 
many thin layers kept loose from each other with butter, or in this 
case Palm Oil based margarine. Commercially, the disks are interleaved 
with plastic and frozen. They are not thawed before cooking because it 
would be very difficult to peel off the plastic if they were soft. 
They are then pan fried in very shallow oil until lightly golden. You 
need to use a very good oil because these absorb quite a bit of it, so 
the oil greatly affects the flavor. Made in Pakistan, 7 inches diameter, 
2-5/8 ounces each, wheat flour, water, palm based margarine, salt, 
baking powder (E500). 
<br class=cll>

<h3>Puri</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Poori, Boori]
<br><img src="img/bk_indpuri01h.jpg" alt="Three Puri Puffs" class=mrg>
These are usually served with a curry and chutney. This is a small 
unleavened flat bread that is deep fried rather than pan fried. 
Because of moisture in the dough, they puff up. The package of frozen 
puri I purchased pictured them puffed up into pillows, but the actual 
product puffed rather unevenly - they were still good, though. These 
were made in India, 4-3/4 inches diameter, 0.06 inch thick and weighed 3/4 
ounce each. Wheat flour (65%) water, milk (1%), corn oil, salt.
<br class=cll>

<h3>Papad</h3>
<br><img src="img/bk_indpapad01e.jpg" alt="Two Papads" class=mrg>
These are almost paper thin and very brittle. They are served as 
appetizers in Indian Restaurants, at least in California and England 
anyway. In England they are often served with a red onion relish. 
They are quickly dry fried and bubble up some. They may be in various 
sizes and are available with a variety of herbs and spices.
<p>An essential ingredient is papadkhar, which acts as a preservative 
and is also responsible for the bubbling. It is sodium benzoate, which 
may be substituted by a 2:1 mix of sodium carbonate and sodium 
bicarbonate. Made in India, 7-1/2 inches diameter, 0.020 inch thick 
and weighing 5/8 ounce (16 grams). Urad dal, black pepper, salt, 
asafoetida, papadkhar, vegetable oil.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Dosas <small>&amp;</small> Idlis</h3> &nbsp; The next 
two items differ from the above in that they are generally available only 
fresh in restaurants and Indian delis. They are also a bit of a problem 
for making at home, as idlis need an idli steamer or similar, and both 
need the Dal and Rice ground very fine to a paste. This is normally 
done with a Wet Grinder, an appliance very popular in India but almost 
unknown in the West - and they cost around US 2014 $200 to $275. A very 
powerful blender can be used if the grains are well soaked (a food 
processor definitely can't).

<p>Today, in India, many homes make "instant dosa" from rice flour, 
semolina flour and other finely ground flours, possibly with a little 
baking powder or buttermilk.</p> 

<h3>Dosa</h3>  
<br><img src="img/bk_inddosa01e.jpg" alt="Folded Triangle" class=mrg>
These lacy flat breads are very popular in the southern states of 
India, where they originated. They are made of separately soaked, ground 
and fermented Urad Dal and Rice. They are mixed together to form a thin 
batter which is poured into a pan, very similar to how crepes are made 
in the West. There are versions made of other batters as well. The dosa 
in the photo I'm using (until I get time to make dosas) is actually made 
of semolina. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Gpics at en.wikipedia distributed

<h3>Idli</h3>  
<br><img src="img/bk_indidli01h.jpg" alt="Serving of Idli" class=mrg>
Idli are very popular in the southern states of India, especially for 
breakfast. Like Dosa, Idli are made of soaked, ground and fermented Urad 
Dal and Rice. Rather than being fried in a pan, they are steamed in metal 
trays with cup-like depressions. These trays are usually set up in 
tree-like tiers so many can be made at once.
