<h1>Bread <small>in</small> Ireland</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>While the making of bread was known in Ireland from prehistoric times, 
it was little made, and only in wealthy households. The average Irish 
household was simply not equipped for it. The only cooking implements 
were a fire and a cauldron. Until the time of Roman influence, the 
caldron was of clay. From the Romans the Irish got copper cauldrons, 
and later iron ones, but they didn't have even primitive ovens until 
the 20th century. Food was not baked, it was boiled.</span>

<p>Bread was never a staple for the common people of Ireland. Thin 
unleavened cakes could be cooked on a hot rock, and later in a frying 
pan, but you had to be able to afford grain. Anything much beyond that 
had to be baked on hot rocks with the cauldron inverted over it. This 
was very inconvenient, because the cauldron was needed for boiling. Few 
households had the resources to have an extra cauldron. Also, the low 
gluten wheat flour available in Ireland wasn't ideal for yeast leavened 
bread.</p>
<p>The potato was probably introduced to Ireland in 1588, from ships 
of the Spanish Armada wrecked on the Irish coast. The Spanish used 
potatoes on their ships to ward off scurvy. Potatoes were easy to grow 
in Ireland and grains weren't. The cauldron became very busy boiling 
potatoes, and the Irish ate little else. Potatoes are so nutritious 
they needed nothing more except a little milk.</p>
<p>Then came the Great Potato Famine of 1845 to 1852, bringing mass 
starvation. There was plenty of food in Ireland, but the British 
controlled it and would not let it be distributed - their deliberate 
policy was for the Irish to all starve to death.</p>
<p>After the famine, interest in bread was revived. While flour was 
still very expensive, and homes were still not set up for handling 
bread dough, two things made it easier. The first was importation of 
the concept of baking soda from North America. The other was manufacture 
of the Bastable Oven (see photo). Soda bread could be mixed up and 
immediately baked in this oven over hot coals, with more hot coals 
shoveled onto the rimmed top.</p>
<p>Today Ireland is famous for soda breads of many kinds, though 
the arrival of real stoves with ovens in the household has greatly 
reduce use of the bastable oven. &nbsp; <small>Photo borrowed from

<h3>Soda Bread</h3>

Though today Ireland is known as the land of soda bread, it was completely 
unknown there until the early 1800s and did not become widely known until 
after the Great Potato Famine, which ended in 1852. The concept of 
leavening bread with acid and baking soda had been long in use by the 
American Indians (who used ashes) and had been used for some time by 
Europeans in North America. This quick, very simple method of making 
bread suited the poorly equipped Irish household, and also worked with 
the low gluten flour available in Ireland. The photo specimen is made of 
half and half white and whole wheat flour, by our recipe
