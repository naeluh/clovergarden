<h1>Breads <small>of the </small> Nordic Region</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Here we together consider the breads of Scandinavia 
and the Uralic countries, Finland and Estonia. They all had similar 
restrictions on the breads they could make, due to the kinds of grains 
that would grow in the region. Wheat is not practical to grow in the 
region, and without the high gluten of wheat, light breads are not 
possible. Rye was common, but the dough needed to be soured to rise 
even moderately.</span>

<h2>Finnish Sour Rye Bread</h2>
<br><img src="img/veg_bdsrye1e.jpg" alt="Loaf of Finnish Sour Rye Bread" class=mrg>
[Hapanleipa (Finland)]
<p>This photo is from from our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/veg_bdsrye1.html"><b>Sour Rye Bread</b></a>. 
In eastern Finland, this bread is made into fairly thick loaves and 
baked about twice a week. In western Finland it is traditionally made 
into thin loaves the shape of millstones (with a hole in the center). 
In the west it is baked twice a year and strung up on poles until hard, 
then stored in a special room. The eastern Finns think the millstone 
shape is quite appropriate for this hard dry bread. Our example was 
probably half way between the eastern and western versions. This bread 
is traditionally made up in a large stone bowl. The bowl is not washed 
and bits of dough dried to the sides act as starter for the next batch.

<h2>Finnish Barley Bread</h2>
<br><img src="img/veg_bdbarley1e.jpg" alt="Loaf of Finnish Barley Bread" class=mrg>
[Ohraleipa (Finland)]
<p>This photo is from from our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/veg_bdbarley1.html"><b>Barley Bread</b></a>. 
Barley is a grain which grows pretty well under very adverse climate 
and soil conditions, and was the major grain in some regions in 
prehistoric times. Our recipe would not be considered "authentic" by 
purists, as it does incorporate some wheat flour. On the other hand, 
I think Finns have sold enough telecom equipment by now to afford an 
occasional bag of imported wheat flour.

<p>
Production of Crispbread began in Sweden about 500 CE, and it remains 
very popular throughout northern Europe. It always had a hole in the 
middle so it could be strung on long poles, which were suspended from 
the rafters of the home, a storage method also used in Finland. It was 
made twice a year, after harvest and in spring. It was made of whole 
grain Rye flour, salt and water. Before baking, crushed ice was kneaded 
into the dough which would lighten it when evaporation left holes in the 
bread. The photo specimen, Leksands brand, was made in Sweden. Ingred: 
Rye flour, water, yeast, salt.
