<h1>Bromeliads</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The large family <i>Bromeliaceae</i> (3168 species) stands within 
the huge and culinarily important order <i>Poales</i>, the grasses and 
grains, which they don't much resemble. They are very well known for 
spectacular decoratives, and the leaves are an important source of fiber 
in their region. Only one species is of significant culinary (and 
economic) interest - very significant, actually. Bromeliads are 
native to the tropical Americas, and into the subtropical zone. One 
species is native to Africa, carried there by migratory birds.

<h2>Pineapple</h2>
<br><a href="bl_pineapz.html">
<img src="img/od_pineapple05d.jpg" alt="Whole Pineapple Fruit" class=mrg></a>
[Pi&ntilde;a, Anan&aacute; (Spanish); <i>Ananas comosus</i>]
<p>
The Pineapple is the only bromeliad familiar as food in North America, or 
just about anywhere else. They were taken throughout the tropics by the 
Spanish and Portuguese, and are now grown in humid tropical regions worldwide.
</p>
<p>A large flower spike grows at the top of the plant, with about 200 
flowers. Each flower produces a berry, and as the berries mature, they 
fuse together into the multiple fruit we call a "pineapple".
Fertilization must be prevented or the pineapple will be full of seeds, 
South American pineapples are green when ripe but some of the patented 
varieties, particularly from Hawaii, are green and gold when ripe.

<h2>Chagual</h2>
<br><img src="img/bl_puya01c.jpg" alt="Blooming Chagual Plants" class=mrg>
[<i>Puya chilensis</i> and other <i>Puya</i> species]<p>
This bromeliad is native to north facing hillsides of the Andes mountains 
of west central Chile. It is reported that natives of the region use the 
bases of young leaves to make salads. The leaf fibers are probably of 
more culinary value because they are used to weave durable fishing nets.
