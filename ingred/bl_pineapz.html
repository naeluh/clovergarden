<h1>Pineapple</h1>
<br><img src="img/bl_pineapp05b.jpg" alt="Fresh &amp; Whole Pineapple" class=mrg>
[Pi&ntilde;a, Anan&aacute; (Spanish); <i>Ananas comosus</i> of family <i>Bromeliaceae</i>]
<p>
The Pineapple is the only bromeliad familiar as food in North America, or 
just about anywhere else. Originating in South America, they were taken 
throughout the tropics by the Spanish and Portuguese. Major producers are 
Hawaii (USA), Costa Rica, Brazil, Thailand, and Philippines. Most sold 
fresh in North America come from Hawaii and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>A large flower spike grows at the top of the plant, with about 200 
flowers. Each flower produces a berry, and as the berries mature, they 
fuse together into the multiple fruit we call a "pineapple".
Fertilization must be prevented or the pineapple will be full of seeds, 
a reason why humming birds are illegal in Hawaii, as they are the primary 
pollinator.</p>
<p>South American pineapples are green when ripe but some of the patented 
varieties, particularly from Hawaii, are green and gold when ripe. Pineapples 
sold here in Southern California weigh 3 to 5 pounds. The photo specimen, a 
4-1/2 pound fruit, yielded about 2-1/2 pounds (55%) when trimmed and cored. 
Chopped it's about 7-1/2 ounces per cup.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; To tell if a pineapple is ripe, sniff at the stem 
end. If it smells like pineapple, it is ripe. If it has very little smell, 
it is not ripe, and if it smells fermented, it is over-ripe. The don't 
ripen farther once cut from the plant.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Pineapples will keep a few days at a cool room 
temperature, a little longer bagged in plastic and refrigerated. Once cut 
they must be refrigerated and consumed within a couple of days.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; <p></p>

<tr><td class=top>
  <img src="img/bl_pinapp05d.jpg" alt="Pineapple, top and bottom cut off." class=mrg>
  </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=top>Here is a 3 pound Pineapple with the top 
  and bottom cut off. All cuts made in this series were with a razor sharp 
  Santoku, our recommended vegetable slicing knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=top>
  <img src="img/bl_pinapp08d.jpg" alt="Pineapple with sides shaved off." class=mrg>
  </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=top>The next step is to shave off the outside 
  skin. Do a number of shallow cuts so you don't loose too much pineapple.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=top>
  <img src="img/bl_pinapp11d.jpg" alt="Pineapple spiral cut to remove 
  deep flower remains." class=mrg>
  </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=top>You will still have remaining 
  dark brown spots which are the remains of the flowers. You will notice they 
  are in a spiral pattern (more obvious and uniform on some pineapples than 
  others). You can cut them out with spiral trenches, but cut only as deep as 
  needed to remove the dark brown stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=top>
  <img src="img/bl_pinapp14d.jpg" alt="Pineapple sliced lengthwise" class=mrg>
  </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=top>Now cut the pineapple lengthwise into 
  quarters, 8ths (quarters cut in half lengthwise) or 12ths (quarters cut 
  twice lengthwise. Now you can cut away the hard central core, easiest with 
  8ths or 12ths.
  <p>An alternative method is to cut the pineapple in slices crosswise, and 
  remove the core with a sharp cookie cutter or similar. For snacks, some 
  do not remove the core, but leave it to hold the slice on a fork while 
  biting off all around the core. This is a good plan for kids, but don't 
  eat too much or your lips will sting.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top>
  <img src="img/bl_pinapp17d.jpg" alt="Pineapple cut into chunks" class=mrg>
  </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=top>Here the pineapple is cut into bite size 
  chunks, ready for inclusion in a recipe. These chunks were cut from a 
  pineapple cut into 12ths lengthwise.
  <p>The photo specimen was a small (3 pound) pineapple which yielded 1 pound 
  3 ounces (40%). A larger pineapple will yield up to 55% for a 4-1/2 
  pound specimen.</p>
  <p>Cut this size, weight is about 7 ounces per cup. It would be a little 
  more chopped into smaller pieces.</p></td></tr>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2>
<p>Pineapple is very high in manganese and vitamin C, and low in just about 
everything else - except sugars and acid.
