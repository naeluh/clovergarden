<h1>Banana Blossom</h1>
<br><img src="img/bn_blossum06f.jpg" alt="Banana Blossoms, whole and peeled" class=mrg>
[banana heart; banana bell (Australia); Dok kluai (Thai); 
Mak Bpee (Laos); Shang chao fua (China); <i>Musa acuminata</i>, 
<i>M.  balbisiana</i> and <i>M. acuminata x balbisiana</i>]
<p>
This pointy heart shape item is the male inflorescence of the banana or 
plantain plant. It forms a point at the end of the flowering stem and 
consists of red leaf like bracts covering rows of male flowers. The bracts 
curl up one by one, each exposing a row of flowers (not "baby bananas" as so 
many descriptions say). Above the "blossom" are a large number of female 
flowers that will mature into bananas  Commercial bananas are sterile, so 
the male inflorescence is not needed and is often cut off and sold 
separately.</p>
<p>The photo specimens weighed 1 pound 2 ounces, were 3-3/8 inches diameter 
and 8-3/4 inches long, about medium size. They were imported from Mexico, 
as most sold in California are (The U.S. is too cool for successful banana 
cultivation).</p>

<p>Banana blossom tastes a bit like banana peel but less bitter and 
astringent. The red outer bracts are not edible but make very nice 
decorative boats for serving salads and such in.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Banana blossoms are used in Southeast Asian, 
African and tropical American cuisines. They are most easily available in 
markets serving a Southeast Asian community, particularly Philippine. 
Select firm, bright colored blossoms. They can be stored in the 
refrigerator, wrapped in plastic, for a few days. I understand dried 
banana blossom is also sold, but I have seen only fresh here in Los 
Angeles.<p></p>
 
<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; You need to peel off the tough, bitter outer bract 
layers and their associated flowers until you get to the yellow inner 
layers which are brittle rather than tough. The inner section can then be 
sliced or diced for use in recipes. The moment you cut them put the pieces 
in a bowl of cold water acidulated with citric acid or lemon juice, they 
discolor very quickly. A 1 pound 2-1/8 ounce blossom yielded 6 ounces 
of crisp edible material (33%).<p></p> 

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't get banana blossoms or don't like 
their slightly bitter flavor, you can replace them in recipes with 
slivered Bamboo Shoots.<p></p>
