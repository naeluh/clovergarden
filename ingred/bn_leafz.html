Banana leaf is used in many tropical areas of the world in place of 
plates, particularly at banquets and other large events, and in street 
food stalls and restaurants. Plantain leaves may be a little tougher 
than leaves of desert bananas. Leaves are also an important food wrapper 
particularly to hold and protect food during steaming and for making rice 
cakes, which may be cylindrical or pyramid shaped.</p>

<p>The photo shows a half banana leaf (split down the spine) with a 
little off the ends. They are sold here in Southern California as 
half and quarter leaves, fresh or frozen. The photo specimen, 6 feet 
long and 10 inches wide, was not the longest or widest in the batch, 
but was the longest that fit on my carpet.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Banana leaves are easily available in the freezer 
cases of Asian grocers here in Southern California, and probably through 
much of the country. They need to be thawed thoroughly before unfolding, 
but any leftovers can be refrozen without degrading. They are sometimes 
available fresh here in Los Angeles, but sell out quickly. We have plenty 
of banana plants growing here, but we also have the Santa Ana winds which 
split them up pretty badly. Banana plants are tropical decoratives here 
and don't fruit, because Southern California is too cold for them.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Banana leaves should be passed over a flame or 
blanched in boiling water before use as a wrapper. This makes them more 
flexible and less likely to split up.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Used as wrappers, banana leaves impart only a 
slight flavor to food, so if you can't get them you can use corn husks 
or parchment paper, or even aluminum foil (if no acidic ingredients) 
without destroying the recipe. Of course the appearance will not be 
"authentic".<p></p>
