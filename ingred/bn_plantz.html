This is a culinary classification of bananas, and not a specific 
scientific definition. This name is applied to bananas that are starchier 
and less sweet than "dessert" bananas like Cavendish. Plantains are most 
often cooked while still green or somewhat green, but are also cooked when 
yellow, depending on taste and texture desired. They are still quite firm 
when solid yellow and can still be fried in that state. Some recipes call 
for them ripe, when they will be solid black and finally have softened. 
The flesh tends to be a little orange in color. The average plantain 
sold in North America is about 12 inches long and weighs about 9-3/4 
ounces.</p>

<h3>Plantain Stems <small>&amp;</small> Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Stems are 
eaten particularly in southern India (Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala). When 
the bunch of bananas is harvested, the plant is cut down and layers 
peeled off to get to the tender central stalk. This is chopped and 
prepared in salads and curries. The outer layers are used for binding 
string and for weaving mats. Young immature Shoots are sometimes cooked 
and eaten in Ethiopia.<p></p>

<h3>Plantain Roots:</h3> &nbsp; Root corms are sometimes eaten in 
Ethiopia, but not as commonly as those of the related Enset. They are 
soft and starchy just before the flowering stage.<p></p>

<h3>Plantain Leaves <small>&amp;</small> Blossoms</h3>: &nbsp; These are 
used the same as those of other bananas.<p></p>

These are  much smaller than the more common plantains and rather boxy in 
shape. The photo specimens were between 6 and 6-1/2 inches long (not 
counting stem) and weighed about 6-1/4 ounces. A 6-1/4 ounce specimen 
yielded 3 ounces peeled (48%). In the yellow state shown they were rather 
firm, starchy and not particularly sweet. This plantain is used widely 
for sweets and savories.</p>
<p>Large South American plantains are now grown in the southern 
Philippines but have not caught on yet because their size makes them 
awkward for the most common uses, and because many people are unaware 
they become sweet enough for their other uses when solid black.

<p>Plantains are starchier, firmer and less sweet than dessert bananas so 
they are most often cooked rather than eaten raw out of hand. Personally 
I rather like them just peeled, because I like my fruit snacks a bit less 
sweet than many do. In southern India the peels are diced small and used 
in some recipes, but I haven't yet found what kind of recipes.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Plantains are so important to so many tropical 
cuisines they are available even in some supermarkets in any region that 
has significant ethnic populations. They ripen fairly slowly, so buy them 
near the condition you need if you can. They are firm enough to slice and 
fry from solid green to solid yellow but soften as they turn black.<p></p>
 
<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; They peel just like regular bananas. Slice per the 
recipe you have chosen. Some recipes call for them to be cooked in their 
skins.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Because plantains are a staple starch in the 
tropics worldwide, taking the place potatoes have in more temperate 
climes, there are many hundreds of ways to cook them. Plantains are most 
commonly fried in oil until golden brown, then eaten as is or included in 
recipes. They are often served as a side dish just as potatoes are. They 
may also be sliced thin and fried crisp like potato chips.<p></p>
