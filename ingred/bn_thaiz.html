<h1>Thai Bananas</h1>
<br><img src="img/bn_thai06g.jpg" alt="Green and Yellow Thai Bananas" class=mrg>
[Gluay, Kluai (Thai)]
<p>
Bananas are very important in the cuisine of Thailand, and probably more 
than 50 varieties are grown there, each with unique characteristics that 
make it suitable for particular uses. Those most commonly found in 
markets in Thailand are listed below. The leaves are also much used for 
food service, for wrapping foods for steaming, and other applications. 
Even the stems have uses, but not as food (though they are fed to 
animals).

<h3>Gluay Naam Waa:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Musa acuminata x 
balbisiana</i> (ABB)) This is an "all purpose" Banana, useful for 
both cooking, eating out of hand, and in fruit salads and the like. 
This short plump banana is the the most popular banana in Thailand, 
and much used for fried bananas. They are very common here in 
Los Angeles (2016 on) as they are now grown in vast quantities in 
Mexico.

<p>These are shipped to California either dead green or showing just a 
trace of yellowing. If buying green for cooking, don't buy too far ahead 
as they ripen fairly quickly. When they are at the right stage you can 
slow further ripening by refrigerating. They are generally about 5 
inches long (not counting the stem) and weight 3.5 ounces.</p>

<h3>Green Naam Waa</h3> are on the left in the photo. These are in a 
state where it takes about 1-1/2 hours simmering to make them tender 
for eating, though still quite firm. They have almost no sweetness at 
this stage. With just a little more yellowing they would cook more 
quickly and have a touch of sweetness.<p></p>

<h3>Yellow Naam Waa</h3> are on the right in they photo. These are 
just ripe enough for eating, They are still quite firm and would be 
sweeter with just a little more blackening of the skins. These take 
about 15 minutes simmering to cook them through. They will still be 
intact but quite soft and quite noticeably sweet. 

<p><b>Subst:</b> The Mexican Burro Banana, available in Hispanic markets, 
is considered a good substitute.

<p>No other Thai Bananas than the Naam Waa are available in markets 
here in Southern California, but there are a number of them popular 
in Thailand that may eventually appear here.</p>

<h3>Gluay Tani</h3> 
<br><img src="img/bn_wild01d.jpg" alt="Wild Banana cut open" class=mrg>
[<i>Musa balbisiana</i> B Group]
<p>
Wild bananas are not found in the markets, here or in Thailand. 
They are widespread, but their fruit is full of hard black seeds. These 
plants form clumps in the wild, but are not planted around homes because 
of their association with the ghostess Nang Tani. When seen, she takes 
the form of a young woman with a slightly green complexion, floating 
with her feet just above the ground. She usually has a gentle 
disposition, but it's considered unwise to take risks with ghosts. 
Yellow ribbons are tied around banana plants she is thought to live 
within.</p>

<h3>Gluay Hom;</h3> &nbsp; (Fragrant Banana) Similar in appearance to 
  American Cavendish bananas, but actually Gros Michel, its commercial 
  predecessor (AAA group). These are not widely known today because 
  the major plantations were wiped out by a fungus. They are not being 
  shipped to North America.<p></p>

<h3>Gluay Khai:</h3> &nbsp; (Egg Banana) Very short and wide, with thin 
  skin and very strong scent. Not seen in North America, probably because 
  it doesn't ship well.<p></p>

<h3>Gluay Lep Muu Nang:</h3> &nbsp; (Dancer's Fingernail, or Lady 
  Finger Banana) Short and thin, rather pointed at the tip end and very 
  sweet.<p></p>

<h3>Gluay Hak Muk:</h3> &nbsp; (Plantain) Large, thick skinned cooking 
  bananas, similar to those available in Hispanic markets here in North 
  America.<p></p>
