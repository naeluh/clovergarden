<h1>Boraginaceae  (Family)</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The Forget-me-not / Borage family (<i>Boraginaceae</i>) was placed by 
APG IV 2016 as the only Family within the Order <i>Boraginales</i>, itself 
placed within the clade <i>lamiids</i> unplaced within the clade <i>euastrids</i> 
(true astrids) unplaced within the clade <i>Astrids</i> which is 
placed in the clade <i>superastrids</i> within the Core Eudicot division 
of the clade <i>Eudicots</i>. In other words, confused and subject to 
revision.</p>
<p> Most recently, Order <i>Boraginales</i> seems to be attached directly 
to Clade <i>Astrids</i>. Family <i>Boraginaceae</i> is still further divided 
into 6 subfamilies, which division we ignore here as irrelevant to culinary 
matters.

<h2>Ahiflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/bo_ahiflower01h.jpg" alt="Ahiflower plant in bloom" class=mrg>
[Field Gromwell, Corn Gromwell, Bastard Alkanet; <i>Lithospermum arvense</i> 
alt <i>Buglossoides arvensis</i>]
<p>This herbal plant is native to Eurasia, from Ireland to Japan, as far north 
as Korea and as far south as northern Pakistan. It has been introduced to much 
of North America and Australia. Until recently, this was a wild weed, but 
is now being increasingly cultivated. Its seed oil is currently of great 
interest in the nutritional supplement industry, due to it's Omega-3 oil 
content.</p>
<p>The Omega-3 oil in Ahiflower is high in SDA (stearidonic acid) which the 
body can easily convert to the DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA 
(eicosapentaenoic acid) typical of marine oils. DHA and EPA are the types of 
Omega-3 that are important to human health. ALA (alphalinolenic acid), the 
type of Omega-3 provided by flaxseed, canola oil, chia seeds, soybeans, 
walnuts, and pine nuts is very difficult for the body to convert to SDA (about 
8% conversion) which it can then convert to DHA and EPA. ALA is not of direct 
benefit to human health.

   [Dyer's Bugloss, Orchanet, Spanish bugloss, Languedoc bugloss; 
   Ratan Jot (India); <i>Alkanna tinctoria</i>]
   <p>
   This plant, native to the Mediterranean region, has blue flowers on 
   very hairy foliage, and a root that looks black from the outside but 
   is blue-red on the inside. It has long been used as a dye and as a 
   stain for wood, but also as a food coloring, particularly to color 
   wine, other alcoholic beverages and vegetable oils (the color is 
   soluble in alcohol and oils, but not water). In India, under the 
   name Ratan Jot, it has been traditionally used to color some versions 
   of Rogan Josh curry. Alkanet is currently approved as a food coloring 
   in Australia but banned in the European Union.

   [Knockaway, Sandpaper tree, Sugarberry; Anacua (Mexico); 
   <i>Ehretia anacua</i>]
   <p>
   This tree, native to northeastern coastal Mexico and southeastern coastal 
   Texas, can grow to 45 feet on the floodplains, but remains shrub size 
   on arid hillsides. It produces clusters of tiny reddish yellow fruit,  
   usually between 0.25 and 0.32 inches (7 to 8 mm) diameter. The fruit 
   contains 2 stones, each containing 2 seeds, but the edible flesh is 
   sweet and juicy - also enjoyed by birds and various mammals.

   <h2>Borage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bo_borag01h.jpg" alt="Borage Plant with Flowers" class=mrg>
   [Starflower; <i>Borago officinalis</i>]
   <p>
   This herb is native to the Mediterranean region, but hardy enough to 
   grow in the British Isles. It has become naturalized in many other 
   regions, particularly by escaping from gardens. This herb has long 
   been grown in home gardens for its fresh leaves, which have a 
   cucumber-like aroma and flavor. It has also been grown as a medicinal, 
   but the main purpose of commercial cultivation today is for borage 
   seed oil, often sold as "Starflower Oil". This oil has the highest 
   percentage of gamma-linoleic acid of any plant oil, and is sold into 
   the ever profitably "health conscious" market as a supplement.</p>
   <p>Used fresh, the leaves often appear in European salads. The bright 
   blue flowers are sweet and nontoxic, making them desirable as a color 
   garnish, particularly for deserts. In Germany, the leaves are often 
   used in soups, but in Frankfurt they are made into a green sauce called 
   Gr&uuml;ne So&szlig;e. In Liguria, Italy, borage is often used as a 
   filling for ravioli and pansoti. The leaves are used as a vegetable 
   in the Navarra and Arag&oacute;ne regions of Spain, boiled and 
   saut&eacute;ed with garlic. They are also popular on the island of 
   Crete. Borage has been long used as a medicinal, particularly for PMS 
   and menopause symptoms.

   <h2>Bugloss - Italian</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bo_azurea01h.jpg" alt="Italian Bugloss Plants with Flowers" class=mrg>
   [Agoglossos (Crete); <i>Anchusa azurea</i>]
   <p>
   This herb is native to Europe, Western Asia and parts of North 
   Africa. Elsewhere it is known as a noxious weed. On the island of 
   Crete, tender stems are eaten steamed, boiled or fried.

   <h2>Comfrey - Tuberous</h2> 
   <br><img src="img/bo_comft01h.jpg" alt="Tuberous Comfrey Plants with Flowers" class=mrg>
   [Meacan dubh cnapach (Gaelic); <i>Symphytum tuberosum</i>]
   <p>
   This herb is native to Europe, including the British Isles, but 
   while common in Scotland it is not common in England and Wales. It 
   has been extensively planted in Ireland, and to some extent in the 
   West Coast region of North America. While the best known comfrey, 
   <i>Symphytum officinale</i>, is too toxic to use except medicinally, 
   Tuberous Comfrey is also used as an edible plant. In the spring, when 
   the leaves are tender, they are used as a potherb. They are not eaten 
   raw because they are hairy and toxic until cooked. The root tubers 
   are used mainly as a non-acidic substitute for coffee, roasted until 
   brown and brittle, then ground.

   <h2>Heliotrope - European</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bo_helio01h.jpg" alt="Flowering European Heliotrope Plant" class=mrg>
   [European Turnsole; <i>Heliotropium europaeum</i>]<p>
   There are over 250 species of Heliotrope, many of them native to Yemen. 
   They are noted for being highly medicinal and/or toxic. This one, 
   native to Europe, Asia and North Africa, is the only one that has had 
   significant culinary use. In Europe, sap from the flowers was used as 
   a food coloring in Medieval times, and in France into early modern 
   times. It is no longer so used due to toxicity and easy availability 
   of other colorings.

   <h2>Koda</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bo_koda01h.jpg" alt="Koda Fruit Cluster" class=mrg>
   [Koda (Australia); <i>Ehretia acuminata</i>]<p>
   This tree, native to East Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and 
   Australia, grows to nearly 100 feet high. It produces large clusters 
   of tiny yellow or red fruit, 0.16 to 0.20 inches (4 to 5 mm) diameter. 
   The fruit contains 2 to 4 large seeds, which doesn't leave much to 
   eat, but it is edible. It is also eaten by many birds. The tree is 
   used for building timber, furniture making and in traditional Chinese 
   medicine, but the fruit is now only occasionally eaten.

   [Mareer; Snottygobbles, Glueberry, Narrow-leafed Bird Lime Tree; 
   Kerosene wood (Papua New Guinea); Tou, Kou (Hawaii); 
   <i>Cordia subcordata</i>]<p>
   This tree is native to Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia including 
   Philippines, and the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii. It produces 
   small clusters of oblong fruit, 3/4 to 1-1/8 inches long, containing 
   one to four seeds. Ripe, the fruit is woody and unappetizing, designed 
   to float long distances across the sea. The seeds are edible but used 
   mainly as famine food.</p>
   <p>The main culinary use for this tree has been in ancient Hawaii. 
   Because the wood did not taint or flavor food is was used for bowls, 
   utensils and large containers of 2 to 4 gallon size for fermenting  
   and storing Poi (a paste made from cooked taro roots - the main staple 
   of traditional Hawaiian cuisine).

   <p>
   Fragrant Manjack is native to Pakistan, Nepal, northern India, Sri 
   Lanka, Southeast Asia including Philippines, China, Ryuku Islands, 
   Taiwan, New Guinea, northern Australia and New Caledonia.  It produces 
   small clusters of pink fruit, 1/2 to 3/4 inch diameter, containing a 
   single large seed. Ripe, the fruit is mucilaginous (used for glue in 
   offices), a bit insipid in flavor, very delicate and very perishable. 
   It is usually sold unripe or pickled. <i>C mixa</i> is very similar to 
   <i>C dichotoma</i> and used the same, but the fruit tends to be more 
   tan than pink.

   [Native Willow, Peachwood; <i>Ehretia saligna</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub or small tree, growing to about 20 feet high, is native to 
   northern Australia. It produces tiny yellow or red fruit, similar to 
   that of Koda (see below) but in smaller clusters. The fruits are 0.16 to 
   0.20 inches (4 to 5 mm) diameter, and contain 2 to 4 large seeds. This 
   doesn't leave much to eat, but the fruit was an important food for 
   Australian aborigines, particularly in arid regions. It is not much 
   eaten today due to difficulty in harvesting.

   <br><img src="img/bo_watrlf01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Ball Headed Waterleaf Plant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Hydrophyllum capitatum</i>]
   <p>
   This herbal plant is native to western North America, from British 
   Columbia and Alberta in Canada down to central California, Utah and 
   Colorado in the United States. It was an important food source for 
   American Indians and early settlers. Tender shoots and leaves were 
   cooked as greens and the fleshy roots were also cooked.

   &nbsp; | &nbsp; also Appendaged Waterleaf; <i>H. appendiculatum</i> 
   &nbsp; | &nbsp; also  Broad-leaved Waterleaf; <i>H. canadense</i>]
   <p>
   These plants are native to North America from Minnesota in 
   the Great Lakes region east to western New England and south to eastern 
   Kansas and Virginia. They are perennial herbs that live in moist forested 
   areas. Tender young leaves and shoots are eaten as salad greens and older 
   leaves are cooked like spinach. The flavor is mild, but gets bitter if 
   the leaves are too old. Young leaves may have whitish spots that look 
   like water spots, thus the name "waterleaf".</p>
   <p>The photo is of <i>H. virginianum</i>, which is very unpopular in 
   gardens. It spreads quickly by long root runners and soon takes over 
   everything, and is difficult to impossible to eradicate once established.

   [California Yerba Santa, Mountain balm, Consumptive's weed, Bear weed; 
   <i>Eriodictyon californicum</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub is native to dry mountain slopes of Oregon and California, 
   though there are only scattered populations in Southern California. It 
   can grow to about 10 feet high, and has narrow leaves up to 6 inches 
   long. The Spanish name translates to "Sacred Herb", for its medicinal 
   properties, especially applied to a wide range of respiratory problems. 
   It has recently come to the attention of the food and pharmaceutical 
   industries due to four flavanones it produces. These may be useful for 
   masking bitter tastes.</p>
   <p>This plant encourages the spread of wild fires, having coated 
   itself with highly flammable resins. It does this on purpose, because 
   it quickly grows back from rhizomes deep in the ground, after 
   competing plants have been burned off.
