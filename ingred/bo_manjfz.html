Fragrant Manjack is native to Pakistan, Nepal, northern India, Sri Lanka, 
Southeast Asia including Philippines, China, Ryuku Islands, Taiwan, 
New Guinea, northern Australia and New Caledonia. It produces small 
clusters of pink fruit, 1/2 to 3/4 inch diameter, containing a single 
large seed. Ripe, the fruit is mucilaginous (used for glue in offices), 
a bit insipid in flavor, very delicate and very perishable. It is usually 
sold unripe or pickled. <i>C mixa</i> is very similar to 
<i>C dichotoma</i> and used the same, but the fruit tends to be more 
tan than pink.</p>

<p>In India, sour unripe fruit are cut in half, seeded and pickled for 
use as condiments, as with other Indian pickles. They are quite popular 
In Taiwan, where they are pickled whole and used in soups and as a 
topping for tofu and vegetables. The seeds are also edible, and in 
Burma, the leaves are cooked as greens. The fruit and seeds have long 
been used medicinally.</p>

<p>The photo specimens, pickled in Taiwan, were up to 0.56 inches 
(1.4 cm) diameter. The fruits are reputed to be rather insipid, so they 
are pickled with flavorings, but then the taste is mostly the flavorings. 
Ing: Seeds (Cummingcordia), Soy Sauce, Water, Sugar, Salt, Lactic Acid.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is not a very common item in North 
America, but they are often available in some of the larger Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles. The photo specimens, labeled "Preserved 
Taiwan Seeds",  were purchased in a 4.6 ounce jar for 2016 US $2.19, 
from a market in San Gabriel.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Since most of the flavor is the pickle, I 
would suggest chopping up some Chinese pickled Stem Lettuce, which 
tastes pretty similar, is a lot cheaper, and you don't have to deal 
with the seeds. It is crisper though.<p></p>
