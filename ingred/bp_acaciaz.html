<h1>Climbing Wattle &nbsp; / &nbsp; Acacia</h1>

[Cha-om (Thai); Pak La, Pak Ka (Laos); Su pout ywet, 
Tsu boht (Burmese); Saom (Cambodia); Khang-khu Khangkhuh (Mizoram, 
Manipur India); <i>Senegalia pennata</i>, formerly <i>Acacia pennata</i>]
<p>
This vine-like climbing shrub or small tree (to 16 feet tall) is native 
to South and Southeast Asia. Feathery leaf shoots are used in omelets, 
curries, soups and stir fries in Thailand, Burma, Laos and the Indian 
states of Mizoram and Manipur, adjacent to Burma. Acacia omelets 
are particularly popular as a side dish or added to soups in Thailand, 
and also in Cambodia.</p>

<p>The flavor and aroma will be quite unfamiliar to most people in 
North America, a bit like rubber cement, and may be off-putting to 
some who are not accustomed to it, so use with caution. It is similar 
in taste to Mexican <a href="bp_guajez.html"><b>Guaje Beans</b></a> 
(also an Acacia).</p>

<p>This plant is highly illegal in Australia and New Zealand because 
it invades grazing land. Seeds and plants are also illegal in 
California, Hawaii and the Netherlands.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Your chances of finding fresh Acacia leaves of 
this variety in North America seems rather slim right now, even in 
Southern California. Washed and frozen leaves in sealed packages are 
now available here, as they are in Australia, imported from Thailand. 
The photo specimen was purchased from a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $1.58 for 4 ounces (without stems). 
They are also available with stems for $2.09 for 8 ounces (about 3-1/2 
ounces yield if stripped).

<p>The version "without stems" may have some short pieces of stem 
included, so, after thawing, wring them out and massage the lump to 
locate any stiff stem pieces and remove them.</p>

<p>In Southeast Asia Cha Om is often served steamed "on the stem". The 
diner will strip the stems with his/her teeth. Unfortunately the frozen 
ones "with stems" don't look nearly as nice as fresh steamed, so I don't 
particularly recommend them.</p>

<p>Recipes often call for "a bunch". Judging by pictures from Thailand, 
a bunch of stems probably weighs between 6 and 8 ounces - fairly large 
because only the youngest leaf shoots can be used, and the stems are 
discarded.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  The leaves are bitter and sulphurous when 
fresh (when they may be added to shrimp sauces and the like) but are 
a little milder when cooked. Only the young tender leaf fronds are used 
and these must be stripped from the central stem and inspected for tiny 
thorns.  For a typical three egg <a href="../recipes/ssd_omletaca1.html">
<b>Acacia Leaf Omelette</b></a> recipe you need 1 ounce to 1-1/2 ounces 
of edible leaf.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The best substitute I know is 
<a href="dy_dandez.html">Dandelion Leaves</a>, particularly for use in 
acacia leaf omelets. They won't provide the distinctive rubber cement 
aroma and taste, but many people may find that not to be a disadvantage.
