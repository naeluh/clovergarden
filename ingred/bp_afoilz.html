<p>
This large bean tree is native to West Africa from Senegal east to 
Central African Republic and south to Angola. The pods of this tree 
are up to 19 inches long and contain 6 to 10 glossy seeds up to 
2-3/4 inches long. They are sufficiently toxic to be used as arrow 
poison and to poison fish. An edible oil can be extracted from the 
seeds, but it is mostly used to make soap and candles. Various parts 
of the tree are used medicinally.</p>

<p>The seeds are most eaten in Nigeria. said to provide a meaty taste. 
To make the toxic seeds edible, they are boiled up to 12 hours, then 
shelled. The cotyledons are sliced thin, then boiled for about 2 hours 
and soaked in water for 10 hours. They are then wrapped in banana leaves 
and fermented 4 to 6 days to use as a snack or side dish, 7 to 10 days 
to use as a condiment in soup.
