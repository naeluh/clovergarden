<p>
This medium size bean tree (to 65 feet) is native to West and Central 
Africa. The seeds are reported to be toxic, but the arils (the orange 
coating at one end, is sweet and edible. Despite the toxic reports, 
shelled seeds are ground for use as a thickener in soups and the like 
in Nigeria. Perhaps cooking detoxifies them as is the case with many 
other beans. Young leaves are sometimes cooked as a vegetable, and 
flowers are used as a condiment in sauces.
