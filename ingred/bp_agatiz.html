Native to Southeast Asia and tropical India, flowers of this plant are often 
used as a vegetable throughout Southeast Asia. In Thailand flowers are 
cooked in curries and served raw with a fish sauce dip. In India and 
Sri Lanka young pods and leaves are also used. These trees require hot humid 
growing conditions and are extremely sensitive to frost, so are not grown 
in California. The photo specimens were about 2-1/4 inches long on 
average. 
<p>A small yellow species, <i>S. bispinosa</i>, is also used in Vietnam and 
Thailand but is less popular. That species is grown widely in India for 
non-culinary purposes. A red variety of the larger <i>S. grandiflorra</i> 
also exists.</p>

In Southeast Asia these buds are used raw, steamed and in curries. 
The taste of raw ones is rather bitter, but this is much lightened by 
cooking.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  In Southeast Asia these flower buds are sold 
fresh, laid out neatly in trays. Here in Los Angeles they can be found 
the same way, but frozen. The photo to the left is of a 5.3 ounce tray 
purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles - from Thailand and 
improperly labeled "Squash Flower Whole". They were typically 2-1/4 
inches long. They are also available here pickeled in a light brine.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These need only short cooking. To serve as an 
appetizer or vegetable side they can be steamed. They are often included 
in curries, usually sour curries without coconut, added at the last 
minute. They can be stuffed, often with a shrimp and pork paste, battered 
and fried in the manner of tempura.

In the photo to the left are buds that were packed in a light brine. From 
Thailand, the jar was labeled "Pickled Dok Kae in Brine". Ingred: Dok-Kae, 
water, salt, citric acid, sodium benzoate, sodium metabisulfite. The taste 
was lightly floral, with just a touch of bitterness. Length of the brined 
buds varied from 1-1/2 inches to 3-1/2 inches, with some of the more 
mature buds starting to open.</p>

<p>These could be served as an appetizer pickle, with or without a dip. 
They were purchased from an large Asian market in Los Angeles.
