<h1>Black Eyed Peas</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_blackeye14g.jpg" alt="Fresh Pods, Fresh and Dried Black Eyed Beans" class=mrg>
[Black-eyed Bean, Field Peas; Lobiya, Lobia, Rongi, Chawli (India); 
  family Fabaceae, <i>Vigna unguiculata</i>, subspecies 
  <i>dekindtiana</i>]
<p>
Native to Africa, black-eyed peas are now planted worldwide, particularly 
in India, Africa, China, the U.S. Southern States, the Caribbean, and 
California. They are well known in the U.S. for their use in Southern and 
Afro-American cooking, having been brought over with the slave trade. They 
are also very popular in Brazil, which has a strong African influence, 
also from the slave trade.</p>

<p>The photo shows fresh pods (top) about 7-1/2 inches long, but they 
can get up to at least 9 inches. The tiny dried beans on the left were 
from India. They were typically 0.30 inch long and 0.15 inch thick. 
These beans are called "Chawli", but the name Chawli is also used for 
the larger Black Eyed Peas. In the center are the dried beans common 
in North America, typically 0.40 inch long and 0.22 inch thick. To 
the right are freshly shelled beans, typically 0.58 inch long by 
0.29 inch thick.</p>
<p>The commercial variety in North America is almost universally the 
California Blackeye, but other varieties with different color spots 
and different sizes exist in their native Africa, in India, and in the 
U.S. Southeast.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Black Eyed Peas are always easily 
available as dried beans here in North America. Sometimes fresh pods are 
available here in Los Angeles (and are likely more available in the 
Southeast). The pods are mature, so aren't good for cooking, but they 
shell fairly easily if ripe enough. I find they split easier on the 
concave side. Less mature pods have smaller, greener beans, and can 
be very difficult to shell.

<p>For uses calling for fresh Black Eyes, frozen are widely available 
and will do, with just a little less cooking.</p>

<p>For recipes calling for fresh young pods, you can use the closely 
related Afro-Asian <a href="bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a>, which 
have much the same flavor and much meatier pods. They are widely available 
in markets serving Southeast Asian communities, and now even in some 
supermarkets.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh beans should be simmered in 
salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, frozen a little less. Dried beans 
should be soaked for at least 7 hours in water with 1/2 Tablespoon salt 
per cup of beans (yes, salt - see our 
<a href="bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried Beans</b></a> page).  
Rinse after draining and cook in water to cover until tender. Timing 
will depend on how old the beans are, and really old beans will never 
be tender - so make sure your beans are less than 1-1/2 years old.

<h3>Yield</h3> &nbsp; 1 cup dried = 2-1/2 cups cooked.<p></p>
