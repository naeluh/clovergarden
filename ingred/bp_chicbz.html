<h1>Chickpeas (Bengal / Desi type)</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_chana08g.jpg" alt="Desi Type Chickpeas, Dal, Flour" class=mrg>
[Bengal Chickpeas, Kala Chana, Chana Dal, Bengal Gram (India); Shimbra 
  (Ethiopia)]
<p>
   One of the most important crops in India, these chickpeas are closer to 
   the wild chickpeas of southeastern Turkey than are the familiar 
   Mediterranean (Kabuli) type. Desi is the preferred type in hotter 
   regions.    Shown in the photo are red and green varieties 
   along with Chana Dal (split and peeled chana) and Besan or Gram Flour 
   (chickpea flour ground from the dal). Dal is used more than the whole 
   peas because it cooks much faster, important in a fuel poor country. 
   The red peas in the photo were around 1/4 inch in diameter and weighed 
   about 155 to an ounce, the green slightly smaller.</p>
   <p><b>Dalia:</b> &nbsp; [Pappulu, Bhuna Chana] &nbsp; This is roasted, 
   peeled and split Bengal Gram. It looks just like the unroasted Dal, 
   but is soft and easily ground. "Dalia" is the Gujarati name for this 
   dal, and the name by which it is sold in North America. This causes 
   a lot of confusion, because in the rest of India Dalia means broken 
   grain, particularly wheat.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; All these forms can be found in markets 
serving an Indian community. If your local market has only the red or 
only the green in whole peas, not a problem, they taste the same.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The whole chickpeas can be stored in a sealed 
container away from light for about a year. The dal is also durable 
and will last about a year. Over-aged beans and dal will not cook 
soft.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  A cup (6-1/2 ounces) of dried chickpeas should 
be soaked for about 8 hours in 3 cups of water with 2 t salt per cup 
of beans (see <a href="bp_soak.html">Soaking / Brining Beans</a>). 
One cup will yield a little over 2-1/2 cups (14 ounces) of drained 
beans. 1 pound of dry beans will yield 2 pounds soaked.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Soaked chick peas should be simmered for 
about 3/4 hour to cook. Unsoaked dried beans will take up to 2-1/2 
hours of simmering.<p></p>

<h3>Besan / Chickpea Flour:</h3> &nbsp; The flour, ground from the 
dal, is used worldwide and found in most multi-ethnic markets, and 
some supermarkets. Like whole wheat flour, Besan is prone to going 
rancid. It should be purchased from a source with high turnover, 
be kept in a tightly sealed container, and replaced every 6 months 
or so.<p></p>
