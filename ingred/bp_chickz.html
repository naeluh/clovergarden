<h1>Chickpeas / Garbanzos (Kabuli type)</h1>

[Garbanzo (Spanish - from Basque); Kabuli Chana (India); Ceci (Italy); 
Chiche (France); <i>Cicer arietinum</i>]
<p>
These are the large light colored chickpea so familiar in the Mediterranean 
region, the Middle East and North America. They were not introduced into 
India until the 18th century and came there through Afghanistan, thus named 
for the Afghan capital of Kabul. Kabuli is the preferred type for growing 
in more temperate climates. The photo shows dried peas on the left, fresh 
pods top right and freshly shelled peas lower right. The dried peas were 
about 3/8 inch in diameter and weighed about 50 to an ounce.</p>

<p>These peas are entirely essential to the cuisines of the Middle East and 
North Africa. They appear made into a paste and mixed with sesame paste and 
sometime flavorings in the very popular paste/dip 
<a href="lm_sesame.html#hum"><b>Humus</b></a> and in recipes of all kinds.</p>

<p>These beans proved 100% fatal to French monks in the monasteries in Sicily 
because they could not properly pronounce the name in Italian. Anyone who 
could not pronounce the name properly was immediately slaughtered, along 
with every other French man, woman and child on Sicily. This event is 
historically known as "The Sicilian Vespers", since the slaughter began at 
the Vespers bell (coincidence, not a signal).</p>

<h3>Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; In regions where chickpeas are grown, fresh pods are 
simply broken open and the peas eaten raw as a snack. They can also be cooked 
and have a fresher flavor than dried. Once impossible to get in the U.S., 
fresh chickpeas are becoming fairly common, at least in Southern California.
<p></p>

<h3>Canned:</h3> &nbsp; Canned Chickpeas are a convenient substitute for 
soaking and cooking your own dried peas. Actually they were previously dried, 
then soaked and cooked in the canning process. Soaking your own is considered 
superior but requires planning ahead. A 15oz can yields about 9-1/2 oz after 
draining, equivalent to a little more than 1/2 cup of dried beans before 
soaking.<p></p>

<h3>Dried:</h3> &nbsp; Dried chickpeas should be soaked for about 8 hours 
with 3 cups of water and 1/2 Tablespoon salt per cup of beans (see 
<a href="bp_soak.html">Soaking / Brining Beans</a>). One cup (7 ounces) 
will yield a little over 2-1/4 cups (15 ounces) soaked. 1 pound of dry 
beans will yield 2 pounds soaked. Weights of properly soaked beans will 
change very little during cooking.<p></p>
   
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Soaked chick peas should be simmered for about 3/4 
hour to cook. Unsoaked dried beans will take up to 2-1/2 hours of simmering.
<p></p>

<p>Some recipes, particularly from Armenia, want the chickpeas skinned before 
cooking. This is done by soaking them for a couple days, changing the water 
twice a day, then rubbing them between your hands under water. the peas will 
sink and the skins will float allowing easy removal.</p>
