[Garbanzos (Spanish - from Basque), Ceci (Italy), Chiche (France), 
Chana / Bengal Gram (India), <i>Cicer arietinum</i>]
<p>
Originating probably in southeastern Turkey, these "peas" were taken to 
India and to the Mediterranean region in prehistoric times. We know they 
have been cultivated for over 7500 years, and today remain prominent in the 
cuisines of both regions. Chickpeas require a warm dry 
climate so in the U.S. they are grown mainly in California and Arizona. 
They are grown in other parts of the country but yields decline with 
temperature.Production is increasing rapidly in developing countries, 
particularly in Western Asia.</p>
<p>The photo shows chickpea flour (besan) in the center and clockwise from the 
top green and red Bengal gram (Desi type chickpeas), light colored Kabul type 
chickpeas, fresh Kabul type chickpeas and pods, and Chana Dal (split and 
peeled Bengal gram.

   [Bengal Chickpeas, Kala Chana, Chana Dal, Bengal Gram (India); 
   Shimbra (Ethiopia)]
   <p>
   One of the most important crops in India, these chickpeas are closer 
   to the wild chickpeas of southeastern Turkey than are the familiar 
   Mediterranean (Kabuli) type. Desi is the preferred type for growing 
   in hotter regions.</p>
   <p>Shown in the photo are red and green varieties along with Chana Dal 
   (split and peeled chana) and Besan or Gram Flour (chickpea flour 
   ground from the dal). Dalia [Pappulu, Bhuna Chana], a roasted peeled 
   and split Bengal Gram is not shown. It looks just like Chana Dal, but 
   is almost powdery in texture and easily ground. Dal is used more than 
   the whole peas because it cooks much faster, important in a fuel poor 
   country. The red peas in the photo were around 1/4 inch in diameter 
   and weighed about 155 to an ounce (19 gm / 100), the green slightly 
   smaller.

   <p>[Garbanzo (Spanish); Kabuli Chana, Safed Chana (India); Ceci (Italy); 
   Chiche (France); Hommes, Hamaz (Arab); Nohud, Lablabi (Turkey)]</p>
   <p>
   These are the large light colored chickpea so familiar in the 
   Mediterranean region, the Near East and North America. They were not 
   introduced into India until the 18th century and came there through 
   Afghanistan, thus named for the Afghan capital of Kabul.</p>
   <p>Kabuli is the preferred type for growing in more temperate climates. 
   The photo shows dried peas on the left, fresh pods top right and freshly 
   shelled peas on the lower right. The dried peas in the photo were about 
   3/8 inch in diameter and weighed about 50 to an ounce (56 gms / 100).

   <h3>Hummus Type:</h3> &nbsp;  These look like tiny versions of the Kabuli 
   type Chickpeas and weigh only 22 gms / 100. They are used in the Levant 
   and surrounding regions to make Hummus, as they have thin skins and don't 
   need to be peeled before grinding.

   <h3>Bambai Chana</h3>
   <br>Bambai / Bombay type: this type is similar to Desi type, including 
   the dark color, but are slightly larger. They are popular all over 
   India, but I haven't seen any marked as such in Southern California.
   <p></p>

   <h3 id="cecin">Ceci Neri</h3>
   <br>This type is grown only in Puglia, Italy. It is darker than the 
   Desi type, almost black, and about as large as the Kabuli type.
   <p></p>

   <h3>Dalia</h3>
   <br>[Dalia (Gugarati); Pappulu, Bhuna Chana] &nbsp; This is actually 
   Chana roasted in special kilns. It is soft and often eaten as a snack 
   in India, but may be a little chalky for American tastes. It is often 
   crushed fine for use as a thickener in curries and chutneys.
