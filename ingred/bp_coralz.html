<h1>Coral Trees</h1>

[Genus <i>Erithina</i> of Family <i>Fabaceae</i>]
<p>
Coral Trees are found worldwide. They are often planted as decoratives, 
to replenish nitrogen, to shade other crops, and as support for 
vanilla bean vines. They are generally quite toxic, containing 
strong alkaloids, but some parts of some are eaten. Other parts of 
several are used medicinally. Seeds of some are used as rat poison, 
and bark as fish poison. The part most eaten is the flower, which is 
slightly narcotic and sleep inducing. Young leaves and buds are also 
sometimes eaten, but the beans of only one are edible.

This tree is native to Central America and some of the Caribbean 
islands, particularly Cuba, and has been cultivated and naturalized in 
Panama. The name "Pito", whistle, comes from boys using the flowers to 
make whistles. In Guatemala and El Salvador, the flower buds, picked 
before they turn red and open, are used as a vegetable, similarly to 
string beans. Young leaves and soft young twigs can are eaten, but are 
not particularly tasty. In other parts of Central America, the young 
flowers and shoots are added to soups, usually bean soups, and other 
food preparations as a vegetable. They have a combination of dark 
floral and dark vegetable tastes, and stand up well to wet cooking.</p>
<p>Eating a lot of the flower buds has a sedative effect, 
and young leaves and twigs may be simmered to make a sedative tea. 
The seeds are much more powerful, and the usual dosage is 1/4 to 1/2 
seed.  Crushed branches are used as a fish poison. The photo specimens 
were from Guatemala, purchased frozen from a large Hispanic market in 
Los Angeles (Burbank) for 2016 US $3.99 for 6 ounces, or $10.64 per 
pound. The top specimen in the photo was 2-7/8 inches long.</p>

   <i>Erithina berterona</i>]
   <p>
   This tree is native to the Andean region from western Venezuela to 
   southern Bolivia. It is the only Coral Tree that produces beans 
   non-toxic enough to be edible. Unripe pods can be eaten, but the 
   beans are more popular as food. Pods, which can be up to 26 inches 
   long have 6 seeds, up to 2.5 inches long and up to 1.1 ounces each. 
   A 20 year old tree can produce more than 400 pounds of seeds a year, 
   with the crop coming in earlier than most other crops. The beans are 
   too watery to dry, so are used fresh, boiled or fried for about 45 
   minutes. After boiling, they can be dried and ground into flour. 
   Cooked beans can be used in soups, salads and other dishes. Usage 
   is not yet widespread, but Andean governments are promoting it in 
   their regions.
