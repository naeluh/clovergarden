<p>
   This fermented soybean paste, similar to Japanese Miso, is an 
   essential ingredient in Korean cuisine, appearing in soups, stews,  
   sauces, dips and dressings. The photo specimen was purchased in a 1.1 
   pound tub from a Korean market in Los Angeles. Ingredients: water 
   soybean, wheat flour, salt, fermented soybean powder, rice wine, 
   wheat, soybean powder, malt, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Any market serving a Korean community will 
have this essential paste, in various size tubs and jars. Not being 
Korean, I buy the smallest tubs, 1.1 pounds.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; This is a common product, so you shouldn't 
have to substitute. Japanese Miso is different in both flavor and 
texture, but a similarly colored Miso can be used in an emergency.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This paste is used as an ingredient in 
soups, stews, sauces, dips and dressings. It contributes body and 
flavor. It may be cooked or not depending on the recipe.
