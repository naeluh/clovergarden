<h1>Fava Beans</h1>

[Broad Bean, Faba Bean, Horse Bean (smaller versions), Field Bean; 
Ful Roomy (Egypt); <i>Vicia faba</i> alt <i>Faba sativa</i>]
<p>
Native to North Africa or Southwest Asia, these were the only beans 
common in Europe before discovery of the Americas. They are essential to 
the cuisines of peoples all around the Mediterranean, particularly the 
Near East and North Africa, and are widely marketed in the North 
America. Fresh, once rare, are increasingly available.</p>

<p>Favas come in a wide range of sizes. In Europe, the larger are grown 
for human consumption and the smaller, called "horse beans", mostly for 
animal feed. In Egypt and the Near East small beans are much used in 
cooking. The photo specimens are fairly large beans with pods 
about 7-1/2 inches long. Seeds in the open pod are 1.25 inches long, 
0.75 inches across and 0.5 inches thick. but the average bean is smaller. 
The photo also shows large dried favas both peeled and unpeeled. Unpeeled 
(the dark ones) are most common). Favas, generally the smaller ones 
(Ful Hamam), are also available canned (previously dried).</p>

see our <a href="bp_fulz.html"><b>Ful Hamam Beans</b></a> page.</p>


<p>When fully mature, the pods will start to show signs of browning which 
is when fresh beans are at their largest. Select smaller fully green pods 
if you want beans with a more tender skin and pods speckled with brown if 
you want maximum bean. Fresh beans can be deceptive with full looking 
pods having little in them, so select by feeling the beans inside.</p>

<p>Fava pods can only be eaten very young and must be cooked (toxic), but 
pods that young are not much available, even in California. Mature pods 
are lined with fuzz which cushions the beans and the beans themselves 
have a tough outer skin which is removed for some recipes and not for 
others. After boiling a few minutes the skins are easily peeled off, but 
it's tedious.</p>

<p>Yield of fresh favas is not high. 26 ounces of average size pods 
yielded 11 ounces of beans (42%) which when boiled and peeled became 
6-5/8 ounces peeled (22%). If your recipe is OK with frozen you can get 
pre-peeled favas for much less cost and much less trouble. Fresh pods 
can be kept at room temperature for several days wrapped in paper or 
otherwise protected from drying out.</p>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Fava beans are known to be deadly to people with a genetic deficiency 
of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaise (G6PD), children being 
particularly vulnerable. While rare, this deficiency is found in some 
ethnic groups: Africans and people of Mediterranean descent - ironically 
the regions where fava beans are most consumed.</p>

<p>This enzyme deficiency is thought to provide some protection against 
malaria, but without the enzyme to detoxify fava beans, fever, heavy loss 
of red blood cells and a yellow complexion result. Survivors recover 
completely but blood transfusion may be needed in severe cases. Favas 
should also be avoided by people taking MAOI antidepressants.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Favas are high in L-dopa which is used to treat 
Parkinson's disease and may be helpful in reducing high blood pressure. 
It is also reputed to increase human libido and help with erectile 
disfunction.</p>
