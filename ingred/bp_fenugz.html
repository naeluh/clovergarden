  [Methi (Hindi, Urdu, etc.); 
  Shanbalileh (Persia); Hilbeh (Arabic); Utakbo suneli (Georgia); 
  <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> also <i>T. cerulea</i>]
<p>
This plant, a bean related to clover, has apparently been cultivated 
for over 6000 years in the Middle East and was also well known to the 
ancient Greeks and Egyptians. Both the aromatic seeds and the greens 
are used.</p>
 
<p>In India, fenugreek seed is toasted and included in a number of 
important <i>masalas</i> (spice mixes), and it is also used in the 
cuisines of the Middle East, Persia and Greece. The fresh green leaves 
and stems are used as an herb in these same regions, and dried 
leaves in Georgia and India.</p>
<p>Fenugreek seed is also considered an important medicinal, particularly 
for increasing lactation in nursing women.<p>

<p>In the United States the most important use for fenugreek seed is in 
the production of artificial maple syrup, but both the greens and seeds 
are important in the cuisines of Greece, Bulgaria, Anatolia, North 
Africa, East Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent and as far 
as Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3>Blue Fenugreek</h3>, (<i>Trigonella caerulea</i>) is found in the 
Alpine regions of Europe where it is used as an herb to flavor bread and 
cheese. It is little known outside that area, except in Georgia (former 
Soviet Republic of) where it is much used as a dried herb called 
<i>Utskho Suneli</i>. This species is not quite as strong as the 
<i>T. foenum-graecum</i> that is commonly available in North America, 
but the substitution works well enough.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find the fresh herb in markets serving 
Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Persian or Indian communities. In the 
San Fernando Vally it is usually sold as "Shambe" (a corruption of the 
Persian) and in Artesia it's sold as "Methi" (Indian). Nowhere around 
here is it sold as "Fenugreek". The seeds can be found on most well 
stocked spice shelves and will usually be called "Fenugreek".<p></p>

The <h3>Dried Herb</h3> is rather rare (I know one market that has it), 
but it is very easy to pick fresh leaves off the stems and dry them. If 
you cannot find the the fresh herb, you can easily grow your own 
from seeds (provided they are reasonably fresh).<p></p>
