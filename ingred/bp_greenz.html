<h1>Green Beans</h1>

<p>[<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>]</p>
<p>This is the common green bean here in Southern California, available in 
every market with a produce section. "Green Beans" aren't always green, as you 
can see from the photo specimens, but green is by far the predominant color. 
The dark purple ones are fine raw in salads but if you are going to cook them 
don't pay extra for the color - they come out green. The Yellow Wax Beans do 
remain yellow, but have a weaker flavor than the green varieties. These 
beans are native to the Americas, and unknown in the rest of the world until 
about 1500 CE.</p>

<p><b>Haricot Verts</b> &nbsp; [lit. "Green Beans"] &nbsp; are an effete 
variety favored in French cuisine, more slender and more tender than the 
barbaric (but admittedly more robust) American varieties.

<h2>Flat Green Beans</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bp_flat01f.jpg" alt="Flat Green Beans" class=mrg>
This form was once fairly common here in Southern California, but I haven't 
seen them for years now. Perhaps they are more difficult to grow or harvest 
than the round variety, but, if memory serves me, they tasted pretty much the 
same. This photo is from 2004 CE.<p></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="roman">Romano Beans</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bp_romano05g.jpg" alt="Romano Green Beans, whole and opened" class=mrg> 
[<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>]
<p>These beans are quite common in the produce markets here in Southern 
California and highly favored by some people. They are the same species as 
the round Green Beans, and also from the Americas, but a variety that first 
became popular in Italy. California has a strong Italian influence, so these 
beans became a popular crop here. They are usually 4 to 6 inches long, and 
occasionally can be found in yellow and purple versions. The photo specimens 
were above average in size, the largest being 11-1/2 inches long, 1 inch wide 
and weighing just over 1 ounce. Despite the size they were still quite tender.
Be careful not to overcook these beans as they can become mushy.

<h2 class=lrg id="drag">Dragon Tongue Beans</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bp_dragtong01f.jpg" alt="Dragon Tongue Beans, whole" class=mrg> 
[<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>]
<p>This is a variegated bean, similar to the Romano Bean. It often appears at 
the opening of a new or remodeled supermarket, to show what wonderfully 
diverse produce they will be providing. Then they disappear, never to be seen 
again. I have not seen these beans in the produce markets here in Southern 
California.

<h2>Health and Nutrition</h2>
<p>Green Beans are low in fat, have a good fiber content, and plenty of 
antioxidants, including vitamin C, flavonols, quercetin, and kaemferol. 
Also plenty of A vitamins and vitamin K. Minerals they provide are manganese, 
calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.
