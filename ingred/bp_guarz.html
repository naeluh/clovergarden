[Guar Phalli, Guvar, Goruchikkudu (India); <i>Cyamopsis tetragonoloba</i>]
<p>
This small bean probably originated in India where 80% of the world's 
supply is grown. They are also grown in California, mostly for guar gum but 
some are diverted to Indian markets. They are sold when mature but the pods 
are still green so they can be cooked as a vegetable. These beans grow to 
about 4 inches long (10 cm).</p>
<p>Guar gum, with about 7 times the thickening power of corn starch, is made 
by grinding mature beans. It is widely used in commercial food processing 
and for various industrial uses.</p>
<p>This gum became an important component of "Fraking" mix for extracting 
oil from shale in North America. Demand and price soared, caused a huge 
boom in guar growing in India. The price got so high, alternatives were 
found, causing a tremendous deflation in the price and great hardship 
for guar growers in India.</p>
