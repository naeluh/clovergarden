[Mexican Yam Bean, Saa Got (China), 
  man kaew (Thai), cu san (Viet), sankalu (Hindi), kuzu-imo (Japan), 
  singkamas (Philippine),   bangkwang (Malay), <i>Pachyrhizus erosus</i>]
<p>
Jicama (say HEE-ka-mah) is one of only a few bean plants where a root 
tuber is the edible part. Immature bean pods are cooked in some countries 
but mature pods, beans, leaves and stalks are highly toxic. In the U.S. 
only the root tubers are available. The photo specimen (6-1/4 inches 
across, 2-1/2 pounds) is deeply lobed, but they are commonly without 
lobes.</p>

<p><i>Erosus</i> came from Mexico, but is now widely grown in Southeast 
Asia, the Philippines, China and India. The crisp, white, mildly sweet 
flesh is most commonly just peeled and eaten raw, but in Asia it is 
often cooked. It retains its crispness but quickly absorbs flavors from 
sauces and other ingredients.

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Ahipa</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Andean yam bean; <i>Pachyrhizus 
    ahipa</i>]
  <br> This plant has a similar root which is used similarly to Jicama, 
  but it's a shrub rather than a vine. It is little known outside the 
  Andes region and the West Indies where it was introduced.</p></li>
  <li><b>Goitenyo</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Amazonian yam bean, Jacatupe, 
  Nupe; <i>Pachyrhizus tuberosus</i>]
  <br>This annual vine produces two or more root tubers up to 10 inches 
  long that are used similarly to Jicama. Unlike Jicama the leaves, pods 
  and beans are also edible. The beans and leaves are particularly high 
  in protein </li>

The Jicamas in the photo to the left are typical of those grown in the 
Philippines. They are only about 3 inches in diameter and 4-1/2 ounces, 
but are very sweet compared to our Mexican Jicamas. These were purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eaglerock).</p>

<h3>Buying</h3>: &nbsp; Jicamas can be found in just about any market 
serving a Latin American or Southeast Asian community, and even in 
many regular supermarkets. You want them to be of moderate size because 
than can get a little fibrous when very large. They should be very firm 
and without discolored or soft spots.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; <p>Jicama can be kept a couple of weeks 
unwrapped in a cool dry place, but once cut should be used within a 
week. It won't really keep much longer refrigerated.<p></p>

<h3>Preparing:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, just peel and cut.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Asian recipes Jicama is often cut into 
strips and included in stir fries, where they contribute a crunchy 
texture and absorb flavors from the sauce. Outside Asia they are 
normally eaten raw in salads and the like.<p></p>
