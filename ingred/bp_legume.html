<h1>Order Fabales &nbsp; - &nbsp; Beans, Peas and Lentils</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<i>Fabales</i> is is an order of only four families, three of 
which produce a few medicnals and obscure fruit trees. The fourth, 
<i>Fabaceae</i>, is a nutritional and culinary block buster - so big 
it's divided into sub-families, tribes, sub-tribes, groups and even 
sub-species. It's third largest after 
<a href="dy_daisy.html">Daisies</a> and 
<a href="orchid.html">Orchids</a> - but with a whole lot more to eat.
</p> 
<p>Beans range from tiny herbs to massive trees 300 feet tall. All grow 
their seeds in pods, containing one to many seeds. They are just about 
all toxic, some mildly, some extremely, but some are edible in some 
forms or with special care. The edible part may be immature pods, 
mature seeds, young leaves, flowers or root tubers. Beans also provide 
a wide range of medicinals, flavorings and wood, such as Brazilwood and 
Rosewood.

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Most of the beans Americans are familiar with are from North, South 
and Central America, unknown to Europe and Asia until the 1500s. 
These include green (string) beans, navy beans, lima beans, peanuts, pinto 
beans, kidney beans and the like. Fava beans and Lupini beans were the beans 
known in Europe and the Mediterranean before discovery of the New World. 
In Asia a wide variety of tiny beans, like mung beans, were known, and 
a few in Africa.</p>

<p>Lentils, peas and fava beans were unknown in the New World until 
brought from the Mediterranean by European traders, as were beans of the 
Vigna genus (black-eye peas, mung beans, etc.). Peas and Lentils probably 
originated in Western Asia and/or the Near East, mung, urad and adzuki 
beans probably originated in India, while soybeans originated in China, 
and black-eye peas in Africa, though they are an Asian type bean.</p>

<p>By far the largest selection of beans, peas and lentils in daily use 
is found in India where both New World and Old World pulses are a major 
and essential part of the diet over the entire subcontinent.</p>

<p>Particularly important to India is dal, the word for peas, lentils 
and beans that have been split and peeled. The dal version of any pulse 
requires just a fraction of the soaking and cooking time of whole dried 
pulses. This is very important in a fuel deficient country, but other 
benefits are a softer, smoother texture and more subtle flavors. Dal, 
however, is a tricky word in India, and is sometimes used for the whole 
unpeeled version.</p>

<p>An additional importance of legumes is their symbiotic relationship 
with rizobia bacteria. These bacteria live in legume root nodules where 
they are provided with oxygen and other nutrients in return for "fixing" 
atmospheric nitrogen into compounds usable for plant nutrition. By 
rotating legume crops with grain or vegetable crops, growers can prevent 
the depletion of this essential nutrient in the soil. These nitrogen 
compounds are necessary for the formation of protein, essential for 
human and animal nutrition.</p>

<h2 id="other" class=lrg>Non-Legume Fabales</h2>

<p>There is precious little of culinary importance in Order 
<i><b>Fabales</b></i> that is not in Family <i><b>Fabaceae</b></i>, 
the Legumes. Below is all we have been able to find.</p>


<h2>Family <i>Quillajaceae</i></h2>

   <br>   <img src="img/bp_quillaja01f.jpg" alt="Soap Bark Leaves &amp; Flowers" class=mrg>
   [<i>Quillaja saponaria</i>]
   <p>
   This medium tree, growing to 65 feet, is native to central Chile. Its 
   inner bark contains saponins (natural soaps) that are fairly widely 
   used. The culinary uses are mainly as a foaming agent in beverages, 
   but it has many important pharmaceuitcal uses, and is used in personal 
   care products and in fire fighting foam. This tree has been 
   introduced to California as a decorative.<p>
   <p>The only other species in this family is native to southern 
   Brazil and northern Argentina, but I don't know if it has similar 
   uses.

   <i>Xanthophyllum stipitatum</i>]
   <p>
   <i>X. obscurum</i> is a large tree, growing to about 110 feet high, 
   native to southern Thailand peninsular Malaysia, also Sumatra and 
   Borneo. It appears to be most important in Borneo. It produces dark 
   brown spherical fruits up to 6  inches diameter with a thick rind 
   surrounding a sweet white edible pulp in which are embedded numerous 
   seeds. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Cerlin Ng distributed under licence

   <p><i>X. ecarinatum</i>, native to Borneo, grows to 80 feet and bears 
   orange to brown elliptical fruit 4 inches long. <i>X. stipitatum</i> 
   has a distribution similar to <i>X. obscurum</i>, but grows to 160 
   feet and bears spherical yellow or orange fruit a little more than 
   2 inches diameter. Fruits of both these trees have edible pulp.
