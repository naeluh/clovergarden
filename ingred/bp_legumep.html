<br><img src="img/bp_besam01c.jpg" alt="Mound of Besan Flour" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Cicer arietinum</i>]</p>
<p>
This flour is very popular in India, but now used worldwide. It is 
particularly used for making or coating fritters of all kinds. It can 
be found in just about any muti-ethnic market and some supermarkets. 
Like whole wheat flour, Besan is prone to going rancid. It should be 
purchased from a source with high turnover, kept in a tightly sealed 
container, and replaced every 6 months or so.

<p>[<i>Vicia faba</i> alt <i>V. Faba sativa</i>]
<p>
In Sichuan and Hunan provinces of southern China, fava beans rather 
than soy beans are used to make fermented bean pastes. These may be 
plain (as in the photo) or mixed with chili. They are important 
ingredients in sauces. Ingred: bean, salt.

<h2 id="mung" class=lrg>Mung Bean Products</h2>
<p>[Moong (India); <i>Vigna radiata</i>] &nbsp; Mung beans apparently 
originated in Mongolia, but by 4500 years ago they were widely cultivated 
in India. From there they spread to China and Southeast Asia.

   <img src="img/bp_sproutm01h.jpg" alt="Fresh Sprouts" class=mrg></a>
   [Tao Nge (Thai); Tua Ngok (Laos); Sukjunamul (Korea)]
   <p>
   These are the regular bean sprouts found in just about every grocery 
   market in North America. They are sprouted Chinese style - in India 
   sprouts are cooked at a much earlier stage, when they have a tail 
   about 1/2 inch long and the leaves are just emerging. A far wider 
   range of beans are sprouted in India than just mung beans.

   [Cellophane Noodles, Glass Noodles; fensi, tung hoon, mien, bun tau, 
   bun tao (China)]
   <p>
   Most familiar are the bean threads shown in the photo, but much wider 
   noodles are also made from mung bean starch. They are much used in 
   salads because they need only be soaked in cold water to be edible, 
   but they are also used in soups, and, with care, stir fries.  In Korea, 
   mung bean starch is also made into thin sheets.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Mung Bean Jelly</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/bp_munggel01h.jpg" alt="Block of white mung bean jelly" class=mrg>
   [nokdumuk, cheongpomuk (Korea); liangfen (China)]
   <p>
   This jelly product is much used in Korea, along with similar products 
   made from acorn and yam starch.  This jelly is also made into noodles.
   It is commonly eaten cold with a sauce, but also in stews and 
   soups.  In southern China, it may be made from chick peas rather than 
   mung beans.

<h2 id="soy" class=lrg>Soybean Products</h2>  
<p>[Bhatt (India); Soya Bean (UK); <i>Glycine max</i>] &nbsp; 
Soybeans are probably native to China, and have been important to 
agriculture there since the earliest times - but not as a food crop. 
The beans were planted as a fallow field rotation crop to fix nitrogen 
and restore fertility to the fields, then plowed under. Soybeans were 
not eaten except in times of famine, because they have a wide range of 
toxins and disruptive hormone analogs.</p>
<p>During the Chou Dynasty (1132-246 BCE) techniques were developed to 
create soy sauce, miso and other soy products detoxified by fermentation. 
A little later a method was developed to make a soybean cheese from 
finely ground soybeans by precipitating solids with a salt - the product 
we know as tofu.</p>

   <h3>Miso</h3>
   <br><a href="bp_soymz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_miso01c.jpg" alt="Light &amp; Dark Miso" class=mrg></a>
   Fermented soybean paste was invented in China during the Chou Dynasty 
   (1132-246 BCE) and was the first really successful method to render 
   soybeans edible - and it also produced a very usable byproduct - tamari 
   soy sauce. Both these products are too strong in flavor to be used 
   alone, but they have both become indispensable flavoring ingredients - 
   though most soy sauce is now made by a different process.
   &nbsp; <a href="bp_soymz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Soy Sauce</h3> 
   <br><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_soysz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_soys01c.jpg" alt="Dark & Light Soy Sauce" class=mrg></a>
   [Shoyu (Japan), Soya Sauce (UK)]
   <p>
   First made about 2500 years ago in China, this fermented soybean 
   condiment has long been essential to the cuisines of East and 
   Southeast Asia, and is now used worldwide in almost all cuisines.</p>
   <p>For most cooks there are just two significant types, <b>Light</b> 
   (Japanese or Chinese) and <b>Dark</b> (Chinese). Also, for celiacs, 
   some Tamari type sauces are made with no wheat, thus gluten free. 
   Additionally, you should know the difference between Naturally Brewed 
   (generally considered safe) and Artificial (rather questionable) soy 
   sauces.

   <h3>Tofu</h3>
   <br><a href="bp_tofuz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_tofu01e.jpg" alt="Three Tofu Firmnesses" class=mrg></a>
   [Tofu (Japan, US); Dofu, Doufou (China); Tao Gua, Thua Ngok (Thai); 
   Tauge (Chinese Hokkien); Tau Nge (Thai Hokkien); Tubu (Korea); 
   Bean Crud, Toad Food (improper)]
   <p>
   Basically, bean curd is cottage cheese made by coagulating ground 
   up and cooked soybeans (soy milk) rather than dairy milk. First 
   appearing during the Chou Dynasty (1132-246 BCE), there are several 
   theories for its origin, all of which are unadulterated speculation.
   </p> 
   <p>In this case, most, but not all, the toxins are drained away with 
   the liquid. Two studies have linked high tofu consumption with low 
   brain weight and cognitive decline. Others say this may be not from 
   the beans, but due to aluminum from processing equipment - but that's 
   scant comfort for someone who eats a lot of tofu. Many products, both 
   Asian and Western, are made from tofu, and many of the important ones 
   will be found on our 
   <a href="bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu / Bean Curd</b></a> page.

   <h3>Soybean Sprouts</h3>
   <br><a href="bp_sproutz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_sprouts02h.jpg" alt="Fresh Soybean Sprouts" class=mrg></a>
   [Kongnamul (Korea)]
   <p>
   Soy bean sprouts are larger and sturdier than mung bean sprouts. 
   They are much favored by Koreans - the Korean groceries here in 
   Los Angeles stock a lot more soy sprouts than regular mung bean 
   sprouts. They have a stronger flavor and can withstand longer cooking.

   <h3>Fermented Bean Paste</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_pastsb02k.jpg" alt="Dish of Fermented Soybean Paste" class=mrg>
   [Zhu Jiang (China)]
   <p>
   These fermented pastes are very important in Chinese cuisine, 
   particularly in the making of sauces. They are made by many 
   manufacturers and in endless varieties, with and without chilis.
   Some contain red rice mold and other flavoring and coloring 
   ingredients. The photo specimen, from China, is fairly standard. 
   Ingred: soya bean, water, salt, wine, wheat flour, red rice starter.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Doenjang Soybean Paste</h3>
   <br><a href="bp_doenjz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_doen01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Doenjang Soybean Paste" class=mrg></a>
   <p>
   This fermented soybean paste, similar to Japanese Miso, is an 
   essential ingredient in Korean cuisine, appearing in soups, stews,  
   sauces, dips and dressings. The photo specimen was purchased in a 1.1 
   pound tub from a Korean market in Los Angeles. Ingredients: water 
   soybean, wheat flour, salt, fermented soybean powder, rice wine, 
   wheat, soybean powder, malt, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate. &nbsp;

   <img src="img/bp_yelbean16e.jpg" alt="Three Types of Yellow ean Sauce" class=mrg></a>
   [Nuoc Tuong (Viet)]
   <p>
   Sometimes called "Brown Bean Sauce or "Soy Bean Paste", this sauce is 
   made from fermented yellow soy beans. It is a very common ingredient 
   in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine and available in markets serving 
   Southeast Asian communities. The brown one to the left is a reasonable 
   substitute for fish sauce in many vegetarian dishes.

   <img src="img/bp_blackf06h.jpg" alt="Whole Fermented Black Beans" class=mrg></a>
   <p>
   Wherever a Chinese recipe calls for "Black Beans", this is what is 
   meant. An important sauce ingredient used throughout China and parts of 
   Southeast Asia, they are available in just about any market serving an 
   Asian community. Black soy beans are fermented with salt and ginger, 
   and sometimes other spices, then dried and packaged. The traditional 
   cardboard cylinder package can still be had, but they are now commonly 
   vacuum packed in poly bags.

   <h3>Natto</h3>

   <img src="img/bp_natto02h.jpg" alt="Whole Fermented Natto Beans" class=mrg></a>
   [Cheonggukjang (Korea)]
   <p>
   Most known from Japan, this product is made by fermenting steamed 
   soybeans with a starter culture of <i>Bacillus subtilis natto</i>. 
   It has a fairly strong odor and taste, though the perception of 
   individuals vary. In Japan it is often eaten for breakfast with rice. 
   It is usually sold packaged as a stack of small single serving trays, 
   and may be frozen. Natto is considered a very healthy product both 
   in Japan and by health advocates in North America. Similar fermented 
   products, made with the same bacteria culture, are made in China, 
   Korea, Thailand, the Himalayan region, parts of India, and parts of 
   West Africa.

   <h3>Tempeh</h3> 
   <br><a href="bp_soytz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_tempeh03c.jpg" alt="Cake of Tempeh" class=mrg></a>
   <p>
   A specialty of Indonesia, this product is made by fermenting cooked 
   soybeans with a <i>Rhizopus</i> mold. It is favored by some vegetarians 
   as a meat substitute in all kinds of recipes. In my opinion it doesn't 
   resemble meat in texture, taste or in any other way. In the late 
   1970s it was the "great white hope" of vegans as a non-animal source 
   of vitamin B12. That didn't work out - the B12 came from insect 
   (animal) contamination and vanished under North American sanitary 
   processing conditions.
   &nbsp; <a href="bp_soytz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Textured Vegetable Protein / TVP</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/bp_tvp02h.jpg" alt="TVP Flakes" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This product is made from what is left after hexane extraction of soy 
   oil from soy flour. It is heated and extruded through dies into 
   various shapes, most commonly flake. The extrusion process gives the 
   product a fibrous meat-like texture. It is widely used as a meat 
   analog for vegetarian products and to extend and improve ground meat 
   (it absorbs and retains juices that would otherwise be lost in 
   cooking).</p>
   <p>Residual hexane content is considered too slight to result in any 
   health risk, but other risks associated with unfermented soy, including 
   hormone interference, are a matter of considerable controversy. TVP is 
   very high in protein and low in carbohydrates. The protein is nearly 
   complete, so TVP is heavily used by vegans, both for nutrition and 
   texture.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Soybean Oil</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/oi_soy05c.jpg" alt="Soybean Oil" class=mrg>
   Soybean oil is a very light colored neutral tasting oil with a high 
   smoke point. It is very high in polyunsaturated fats, thus quickly 
   develops rancidity if used at frying temperatures. Nearly all is made 
   from genetically modified beans. It is extracted with hexane and 
   subjected to extensive high temperature processing, deodorizing and 
   refining. While it starts out fairly high in vegetable Omega-3 fats, 
   these are very temperature fragile, so I expect little survives 
   processing.
   <p>Soy oil, formerly used mostly in the paint industry, is now strongly 
   promoted as "healthy" by the industry - and just as strongly questioned 
   by others. Because the industry can buy as many regulators, politicians 
   and scientists (yes, scientists can be bought as easily as politicians) 
   as they need to promote the product, I tend to give more weight to 
   arguments from the other side.  For details of the controversy See 
   our <a href="bp_soyhz.html">Soybeans and Health</a> page. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Soy Milk</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_soymlk02c.jpg" alt="Glass of Soy Milk" class=mrg>
   Soy milk is made by water extraction of ground cooked soybeans and 
   filtering. It is strongly promoted as a "health food", but Its risks 
   and benefits are highly controversial, particularly for feeding to 
   infants. It contains many complex chemical components, some of which 
   mimic human hormones and may affect sexual development. This is of 
   particular interest to some vegans who do not breast feed their 
   infants because that would be feeding them an animal product. Once 
   again, the controversy involves large amounts of money, so it is nearly 
   impossible to know the truth. For details of the controversy See 
   our <a href="bp_soyhz.html">Soybeans and Health</a> page.
   <p> Soy milk is high in protein and contains no cholesterol, but it is 
   low in available calcium.  A lot of work has been done to remove beany 
   tastes and otherwise make it more acceptable compared to the real 
   thing, so different manufacturers use somewhat different processes.

Native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the tamarind tree was known 
to the ancient Egyptians, and taken to India so long ago even botanists 
thought it was native there. From India it was introduced to Persia and the 
Arab world, thus Arabic "tamar hindi" (Indian date). It is now planted 
throughout the tropics and sub-tropics including Mexico, Central America, 
the Caribbean and southern Florida. &nbsp;
