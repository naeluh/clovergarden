<i><b>Fabaceae</b></i> is a very large family in the order <i>Fables</i>, 
including three subfamilies, at least 630 genera and more 
than 18,860 species. Pretty much all are toxic, very mildly to extremely 
deadly, but out of that list of species there are a few important

<h2 id="comm" class=lrg>American Beans</h2>
<p>[Genus <i>Phaseolus</i>] &nbsp; All these beans, now so well known 
worldwide, were unknown in Europe, Africa and Asia until European traders 
brought them from Central and South America. All mature beans in this genus 
are at least somewhat toxic raw or dried. They are safe to eat when boiled 
for about 10 minutes.</p>

<h2><b>Common Beans</b></h2>
<p>[<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>] From about 1500CE, These beans spread quickly 
from the Americas to the rest of the world, where some varieties have become 
associated with particular countries.</p>

   <h3>Anasazi Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_anasazi02h.jpg" alt="White/Purple Aztec Beans" width="220" height="146" class=mrg>
   [New Mexico cave beans, Aztec beans, New Mexico appaloosas, Jacob's 
   Cattle beans.]
   <p>
   These beans may or may not have been grown by the ancient Anasazi in 
   the US Southwest, but the unconfirmed story that they were found in 
   a cave by archaeologists, then sprouted, is pure marketing fantasy - 
   even 50 year old beans won't sprout, never mind 800+ year old beans. 
   In any case, they are a sweet tender bean with a thin skin and good 
   light flavor - a good choice for salads as they absorb dressings well.
   </p> 
   <p>They cooks faster than most beans (45 min for presoaked), and are 
   reputed to be only 25% as fart inducing as the related Pinto Beans. 
   Unfortunately they lose their color pattern when cooked, turning to 
   all pink. One cup produces 1-1/2 cup soaked and cooked. The photo 
   specimens were 0.52 inch long by 0.23 inch thick (13.2 x 5.8 mm), 
   available on-line from various sources for about 2016 US $4.50 per 
   pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Black Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_black10h.jpg" alt="Black Turtle Beans" width="220" height="152" class=mrg>
   [Turtle bean, Frijole Negro]
   <p>
   Essential to the cooking of Southern Mexico, Central America and the 
   Caribbean, this bean is second only to Carioca beans in Brazil, except in 
   Rio de Janeiro where black beans prevail. Their earthy flavor invites 
   strong seasonings and in Mexico's Yucatan region they are often seasoned 
   with the powerful herb Epezota. The photo specimens were typically 0.38 
   inches long and 0.24 inch wide (9.7 x 6.1 mm), but some cultivars are a 
   little larger. Soaked beans will cook in 45 minutes with 1 cup becoming 
   2-1/2 cups. Unsoaked time will be a little more than 1-1/2 hours.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id=cann>Cannellini Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_canel02h.jpg" alt="Cannellini Beans" width="220" height="172" class=mrg>
   [White Kidney bean, Fazolia bean; Alubias (Mexico)]
   <p>
   These beans were developed in Argentina, but the huge Italian 
   community in that country soon exported them to Italy, where they 
   are very poplar, especially in Tuscany. Italian markets here in 
   Southern California stock them imported from Italy at absurd prices.  
   They are also grown in North America, where most are canned, but dried 
   are also available, and will be fresher than imported. The photo 
   specimens, 0.66 inch long by 0.33 inch wide (15.7 x 8.4 mm), were from   
   Bob's Red Mill, purchased for 2016 U.S. $5.66, still pretty expensive 
   for dried beans.</p>
   <p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; While White Kidney Beans are not as toxic, 
   as Red Kidney Beans, they should probably not be cooked in a slow 
   cooker, especially at low setting. They can end up <u>five times 
   more toxic</u> cooked at slow cooker temperatures. They are 
   sufficiently detoxed cooked at boiling temperatures for 10 minutes, 
   but longer is recommended.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="cario">Carioca Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_carioca02e.jpg" alt="Carioca Beans" width="260" height="170" class=mrg>
   [Frijole Carioca (Brazil)]
   <p>This is the most important bean in Brazil, the default bean everywhere 
   except in Rio de Janeiro State where Black Beans prevail. They are often 
   compared to Pinto Beans, so, for comparison, there is a Pinto Bean at the 
   bottom right of our photo. The Cariocas are quite a bit smaller, cook to a 
   lighter color than Pintos, and have a lighter taste. On the other hand, 
   our Pinto Beans have been extensively market tested in Brazil and found to 
   be a satisfactory substitute.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens were typically 0.41 inch long, 0.27 inch wide, and 
   0.25 inch thick (10.4 x 6.9 x 6.4 mm). Soaked beans will be cooked through 
   in 45 minutes, and be just a shade firm. At 50 minutes they are not much 
   different, but start to break up. 1 cup becomes 2-1/2 cups. Unsoaked time 
   will be a little more than 1-1/2 hours.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="cranb">Cranberry Beans / Borlotti Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_cranb02h.jpg" alt="Cranberry Beans" width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
   <p>[Cargamanto, Granados (Chile), Cargamanto (Colombia)]</p>
   <p>
   Originating in Colombia, these large, plump beans are very popular in Italy. 
   If grown in Italy, they are Barlotti Beans, but many sold as such in Italy 
   would be properly called Cranberry Beans, because they are imported from the 
   Americas. Borlottis are available at absurd prices in Italian markets here 
   in Southern California, but are fresher and cheaper as Cranberry Beams grown 
   in the Americas. In Colombia they also have Red Cranberry Beans 
   (Cargamanto Rojo), Cranberry Beans have a creamy texture and a flavor often 
   compared to chestnuts. The photo specimens were 0.62 inch long by 0.37 inch 
   wide and 0.27 inch thick (16.8 x 9.4 x 6.9 mm).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Dragon Tongue Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_dragtoung02k.jpg" alt="Dragon Tongue Beans" width="200" height="170" class=mrg>
   These are a variegated variety of <a href="bp_legumev.html#romano">Romano bean</a>. Clearly 
   the photo specimens have been too long on the shelf, so why didn't I wait 
   for fresh ones? This sort of stuff is only put on the shelf when a newly 
   remodeled supermarket opens - to impress the rubes with how much better it 
   is now. After opening week you'll never see them again. Basically, they 
   taste just like green romano beans so why would anyone want to pay three 
   times as much for them? Well, maybe for salads.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Flor de Mayo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_flordm05h.jpg" alt="Dried brown-purple Flor de Mayo beans" width="220" height="176" class=mrg>
   These beans, native to Mexico, have a high reputation for both taste 
   and texture. They are variable in color, with most a mottled 
   brown-purple, but others tan or light brown. The photo specimens, 
   purchased from a Latino market in Los Angeles, were typically 0.47 
   inch long and 0.29 inch wide (11.9 x 7.4 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="gnorth">Great Northern Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_grtnorth06h.jpg" alt="Great Northern Beans" width="220" height="155" class=mrg>
   [White Beans]
   <p>
   A medium size (0.5 to 0.6 inch long dried) white bean mildly flavored 
   and reasonably firm. It's used for many North American bean recipes 
   and as a substitute for the smaller <a href="bp_legumev.html#navy">Navy Beans</a> in 
   Boston baked beans. These beans are ideal for providing volume and a 
   background for other flavors, but if you want to feature bean flavor 
   use red or pink beans. Pre-soak 8-hrs, cook 1-1/4 hr (2-1/2 hours if 
   not pre-soaked).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Green Beans</h3>
   <br><a href="bp_greenz.html">
   <img src="img/bp_green02h.jpg" alt="Green Bean Pods, various colors" width="220" height="211" class=mrg></a>
   [String Beans / Snap Beans, French Beans, Haricot Verts]
   <p>
   "Green Beans" aren't always green, as you can see from the photo 
   specimens. The dark purple ones are fine raw in salads but if you are 
   going to cook them don't pay extra for the color - they come out green. 
   The yellow ones do remain yellow though.

   <h3>Kidney Bean, Red</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_kidney03e.jpg" alt="Red Kidney Beans" width="260" height="163" class=mrg>
   [Rajma (India)]<p>
   This fairly large bean is one of the most popular New World beans all 
   around the world. The photo specimens were sold as "Dark" and "Light", 
   but they get darker and lighter than these. Yes, that's our famous 
   Red Kidney Bean at the top, joining in for a family portrait. Indian 
   markets will have the widest range from very dark to very light. Dried 
   Kidney Beans run about 0.65 inch long by 0.31 inch wide (16.5 x 8.0 mm) 
   Both standard and light are available canned.</p>
   <p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Fresh or dried Red Kidney Beans are quite 
   toxic, but are detoxed by boiling - <u>however</u>, they should never 
   be cooked in a slow cooker, especially at low setting. Not only will 
   they not be detoxed, but the toxicity can become <u>five times 
   greater</u>. Boil you Red Kidney Beans on the stovetop. They are 
   sufficiently detoxed in 10 minutes, but longer is recommended. You 
   can add them to your slow cooker recipe when they are safe.</p>
   <p>One cup of dried beans weighing just under 1/2 pound will weigh 
   1 pound soaked overnight, which will also be the cooked weight. Cooked 
   volume will be 3 cups. Cooking time for presoaked beans can be as 
   short as 45 minutes for fresh beans soaked with some salt - or as long 
   as 1-1/2 hours depending on age and how tender you want them. 
   Old beans won't cook tender in 8 hours. A 14 ounce can of red kidney 
   beans yields about 8-1/2 ounces of drained beans, about 1-1/2 cups - 
   equivalent to about 4-1/4 ounces of dried beans.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Kidney Bean, White</h3> - see <a href="bp_legumev.html#cann"><b>Canellini Beans</b></a>.<p></p>

   <br><img src="img/bp_mantec01h.jpg" alt="Dried Manteca Beans" width="220" height="139" class=mrg>
   [Prim Bean, Butter Bean]
   <p>
   Long grown in Chile, these beans have been getting a lot of attention
   their reported characteristics of being easily digestible and not 
   producing flatulence. A researcher, Dr. Colin Leakey, has developed a 
   hybrid version that can be grown in England, and it is much in the 
   news there (2012). Here in California we can grow the regular ones. 
   The fartless feature is said to be the result of tannins in the seed 
   coat. The photo specimens, purchased at a large farmer's market in 
   Pasadena, California, were 0.47 inch long, 0.40 inch wide and 0.34 
   inch thick.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="navy">Navy Bean</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_navy06h.jpg" alt="Dried Navy Beans" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
   [White bean, Boston bean, Pea bean, Haricot blanc, Fagioli]
   <p>
   This name usually refers to a dried pure white bean about about .312 
   inch long which is substantially smaller than the <a href="bp_legumev.html#gnorth">
   Great Northern</a> but similarly mild in flavor. These are the 
   traditional bean for Boston Baked Beans. Navy beans are ideal to 
   provide volume and act as a transport for featured flavors other than 
   the beans (molasses in the case of Boston Beans). If you're featuring 
   bean flavor, use red or pink beans. Pre-soak 6-8 hrs, cook 1 hr 
   (2 hrs if not pre-soaked).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Orca Bean</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_orca02h.jpg" alt="Dried Orca Beans" width="220" height="157" class=mrg>
   This is a pretty new bean on the market. Unlike many beans with 
   interesting colors and patterns, this one does not completely lose 
   them when cooked, but they are much toned down. The white has become 
   beige and the black dark brown. Watch the cooking time. Presoaked 
   beans that are fairly fresh can be completely cooked in just 30 min.  
   Pre-soak 8 hrs or overnight in lightly salted water. The photo 
   specimens, from Bob's Red Mill, were 0.43 inch long and 0.25 inch 
   wide (11.0 x 6.4 mm). They were purchased from a Yuppie outlet in 
   Los Angeles (Glendale) for 2016 US $2.99 per pound.

   <h3>Peruvian Bean</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
   <br><img src="img/bp_peru07h.jpg" alt="Dried Peruvian Beans" width="220" height="146" class=mrg>
   [Canary Bean, Peruano bean, Canaria bean, Mayocoba bean, Azufrado bean]
   <p>
   This medium size bean can easily be told from white beans by it's 
   smooth shiny plumpness and distinctly yellow-greenish cast. It is 
   very popular in southern Mexico and Central America, though also 
   grown in Peru and the United States. It is particularly liked for its 
   creamy texture, plump meatiness and thin skin. It is excellent for 
   refried beans. The photo specimens, purchased from a large Hispanic 
   market in Los Angeles (Burbank) for 2017 US $1.29 / pound were 
   typically 0.55 inch long and 0.31 inch wide (14.0 x 8.0 mm).  They 
   need to be soaked 8 hours or overnight in lightly salted water, 
   then simmered about 1/2 hour. Unsoaked they'll need as much as 1-1/4 
   to 1-1/2 hours, but the result isn't as nice as they start to break 
   up with loose skins.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Pink Beans</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_pink03h.jpg" alt="Dried Pink Beans" width="220" height="152" class=mrg>
   Pink beans taste a lot like <a href="bp_legumev.html#red">Red Beans</a>, but in our 
   tests they cooked a bit faster and broke up a lot more, indicating 
   they have thinner skins, so are ideal for pur&eacute;es and other 
   recipes where the beans will be broken up. Pink beans have a deeper 
   bean flavor than <a href="bp_legumev.html#gnorth">White Beans</a> so whites are 
   better as a neutral background and pink for more intense bean flavor. 
   Presoak 8 hrs, cook 1-1/4 hrs (2-1/2 hrs if not pre-soaked). The photo 
   specimens were typically 0.50 inch long and 0.31 inch wide 
   (12.7 x 8.0 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Pinto Bean</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_pinto02h.jpg" alt="Dried Pinto Beans" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
   [Porotos hallados (Chile)]
   <p>This bean is most familiar from U.S. Southwest / Mexican cooking - for 
   "refried beans" bean buritos, and the like. When cooked it loses its 
   mottled color and becomes a uniform pinkish color but has good strong 
   bean flavor. Presoak 8 hours - 1 cup beans needs about 1-3/4 cups of 
   water and will yield 2-1/2 cups of soaked beans. About 2/3 cup will be 
   a little more than one 15 oz can of canned beans. Fully soaked beans will 
   cook in about 45 minutes. The photo specimens were typically 0.48 inch 
   long by 0.34 inch wide (12.2 x 8.6 mm).

   [Silk Beans; Frijol Rojo de Seda (Spanish)]
   <p>These beans are very popular in El Salvador and also in other 
   Central American countries. They are easily available in most of 
   North America, as Goya distributes them under their brand. The dried 
   beans are small, typically 0.54 inches long, 0.29 inch wide, 0.21 inch 
   thick. They have fairly tough skins, so should be soaked in moderately  
   salted water for at least 8 hours before cooking.</p>
   <p>The fresh shell beans in the pod (Frijol de Seda Fresco), on 
   the other hand, are found only in specialty markets when in season.
   The photo specimens were purchased in late August from a large 
   Hispanic market in Los Angeles (Burbank) that specializes in Mexican, 
   South American and Central American foods. They sold at 2017 US $2.99 / 
   pound. The pods were typically 5.4 inches long, 0.53 inch wide and 
   0.35 inch thick. The fresh beans were typically 0.64 inch long, 
   0.39 inch wide, 0.25 inch thick. Yield of edible beans from 1 
   pound of pods was 0.5 pounds (50%).

   [Italian Flat Bean]
   <p>
   In North America, Romano Beans are almost always sold as a green 
   "snap beans", though yellow and purple varieties also exist. Flavor is 
   a little different from the round and flat string beans but not so 
   much as to prevent substitution - just be careful not to overcook as 
   romanos can become mushy. These beans can, of course, be allowed to 
   mature and dry but there's no point as there are plenty of other 
   average size white beans. As green beans, romanos fetch a premium 
   price. The photo specimens are above average in size, the largest 
   being 11-1/2 inches long, 1 inch wide and weighing just over 1 ounce. 
   Despite the size they were still quite tender.

Pallar bean, Burma bean, Duffin bean, Hibbert bean, Java bean, Rangoon bean, 
Madagascar bean, Paiga, Paigya, <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>]</p>
<p>Lima beans are so called because Europeans first shipped them from Lima, 
Peru. There were apparently two separate domestication events. Small flat 
ones probably originated in Guatemala where a wild variety has been found. 
The larger, thicker beans originated in South America, probably Peru, Lima 
bean pods are flat and moderately curved with from 2 to 4 seeds per pod. 
Limas range from the large "Fordhook" variety grown in California to small 
cyanide laced varieties in the Caribbean. The U.S. and some other countries 
allow growing only low cyanide beans but many grown in Southeast Asia require 
thorough cooking to drive off hydrogen cyanide gas.</p>
<p>The pods are often toxic and don't taste good so they are not used for 
food. Limas are not much used in Europe because the warm growing climate 
required is not available there, but are popular in Africa and India.</p>

   <h3>Lima Bean - Large Seed</h3>
   <br><img src="img/bp_limafh06h.jpg" alt="Lima Beans: dried, frozen" width="220" height="141" class=mrg>
   [Garrof&oacute;n (Spain); Double Bean (India); <i>P. lunatus</i> var. 
   <i>limensis</i> (formerly <i>P. Limensis</i>)]
   <p>
   Possibly originating in Peru and brought to the U.S. and Europe from 
   Lima, Peru, these beans were once the largest agricultural crop in 
   California but have been in decline - undeservedly in my opinion. 
   "Fordhook" is the dominant variety. These beans are widely grown but 
   most production is in California due to ideal weather. Available dried, 
   frozen or canned (previously dried). The photo shows dried and frozen 
   fordhooks with our famous dried red kidney bean for scale. The top center 
   bean was 1.05 inches long, 0.75 inches high and 0.4 inches thick.

   [Sieva bean, Butterbean, Rangooni Val / Flat Val (India), 
   <i>P. lunatus</i> var. <i>lunonnus</i>]
   <p>
   Probably originating in Guatemala, these were brought to North America 
   in pre-Columbian times and are grown mainly in the U.S. Southern States. 
   The seed is much smaller and flatter than the California Fordhook and 
   may be streaked with red or purple (Christmas, Florida Speckled, Jackson 
   Wonder). There is a variety called "Butter Pea" which is shaped more like 
   a pea than a bean. Locally available fresh.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Butter Bean</h3>
   <br>This is an inexact term, and can be applied to just about any lima 
   bean. In most of the world it is used for large white beans, but in the 
   United States it varies by region. Most of the U.S. uses "Butter beans" 
   for small varieties but in the Carolinas it is the larger ones. In culinary 
   usage, "Butter Beans" generally means the large yellowish ones, and 
   "Lima Beans" means the small green ones.

   <p>
   This is simply the Large Seed Lima Bean cooked and canned. A 14 ounce can 
   holds about 9-3/4 ounces. These are very good option when it is important 
   your beans all be plump and completely intact, as these were (Goya brand). 
   They average around 1.10 x 0.75 x 0.4 inches (28 x 19 x 10 mm).

   <p>
   This is actually the same as "Lima Bean - Small Seed" above but a purple - 
   tan mottled variety marketed frozen as "Butter Beans" to differentiate 
   them from the green varieties, now mostly called "Baby Limas". The flavor 
   is pretty much the same. The photo specimens were previously frozen and 
   measure from 1/2 inch to 7/8 inches long.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>"Baby" Lima Bean</h3>
   <br>This is a confused term. Often sold frozen, these are not actually 
   babies but are fully mature small Lima Beans. "Baby" is a marketing term 
   used because Yuppies will buy anything labeled "baby", even "baby carrots" 
   machine cut and formed from large carrots.  Most are cultivar Henderson or 
   derivatives but there are also dwarf versions of Fordhook (thicker seed). 
   The original Henderson, a small seed lima, was found growing by a roadside 
   in Virginia, but most commercial production of "baby limas" is now in 
   California. Henderson derivatives Thorogreen and Thaxter predominate, 
   along with some dwarf Fordhooks. Available frozen, dried or canned 
   (previously dried).

   inches (28 x 20 x 7 mm). The largest soaked was 1.56 x 1.05 x 0.43 inches 
   (40 x 26 x 11 mm). Soaking time should be at least 14 hours in lightly 
   salted water, and soaked weight will be about twice dried weight. Cooking 
   time should be at a fast simmer for 45 to 50 minutes. Some may still be a 
   bit firm, but by an hour some will have started to break up.

      <p>
      These small black beans, native to India, are the same size and shape 
      as the familiar <a href="bp_legumev.html#mung">Mung Bean</a>, and are one of the most 
      important beans/dals in India. In Southern India they are a major 
      component of the very popular idlis (steamed cakes) and dosi (lacy 
      pancakes), and are also used roasted as a seasoning.</p>
      <p>Urad beans are sold in three forms, whole (Urad, Black Gram), Split, 
      and split and peeled (Urad Dal, White Lentils). Whole beans take at least 
      a stunning 12 hours of soaking time. 1 cup requires about 2-1/2 cup of 
      water and you'll end up with 3-1/2 cups of soaked beans. Soaked beans 
      will be tender in less than 3/4 hour, unsoaked beans will take about 
      1-1/4 hours to become tender but may not stay as intact as soaked beans.

<p>
These beans are native to Africa, where they are widely grown. They were 
carried from there to India and on to Southeast Asia thousands of years ago. 
There is only one species in this genus, but there are a number of cultivars 
in different shapes and colors. Beans of this type are easy to recognize by 
the very prominent seed scar on one edge.</p>

<p>These beans are grown for animal fodder, human food and medicinal 
uses. Young greens can be eaten raw in salads, or cooked as greens. 
Young pods can also be eaten, generally cut up and cooked. Flowers are 
eaten raw. Mature beans, depending on variety, can contain a fair amount 
of cyanide (they'll be bitter), so need fairly long cooking in an open pot 
to drive it off. The beans are also used in Southeast Asia to make tofu 
and tempeh.</p>

   This variety obviously gets its name from the bright purple color. It 
   is widely grown both for food and as an ornamental for its brilliant 
   purple flowers and pods (the ones in the photo are a bit faded).</p>
   <p>The seeds are shown in several stages of maturing: green, starting 
   to turn color, and purple. The purple ones came from a dried pod, the 
   others from pods like those in the photo. The largest pod was 2-3/4 
   inches long and 15/16 inch across. The largest green bean was 0.63

   This variety is the most common commercial lablab bean in India. It has 
   white flowers, green pods and light colored seeds. In southern India they 
   are very popular young, when they are cut up and cooked as a vegetable. 
   Those in Indian markets around here are usually too mature for that use 
   and have tough pods and tough skins on the beans, which must be shelled 
   and peeled. The most convenient for cooking is the dal, which is already 
   peeled.

Probably originating in India, pigeon peas were established in East Africa 
thousands of years ago and were brought to the Caribbean with the slave 
trade. They are now grown in all tropical and semi-tropical regions of 
the world but until recently were almost unknown in the United States.

cuisines, and essential to the cuisines of southern India where Toor Dal 
is the basic ingredient for sambars and many other dishes. The "red" in

<br><img src="img/bp_dalmix02k.jpg" alt="Various Dals" width="200" height="163" class=mrg>
[Dal, Dahl, Daal (India)]
<p>
"Dal" most often means the split and peeled form of a bean, pea or 
lentil, but not always, and this ambiguity can make Indian recipes 
difficult to interpret. The opposite of "Dal" is "Sabut", which means 
whole beans, peas or lentils. "Sabut" usually appears before the name, 
as in "sabut moong" vs. "moong dal".</p>
<p>Generally, if the recipe calls for soaking for more than an hour 
before cooking, or cooking for more than an hour, it means the whole 
unpeeled item (gram). If there is no soaking time called for and the 
cooking time is less than an hour you can presume the split and peeled 
form. Splitting and peeling shortens the needed soak and cooking time 
drastically, makes the flavor more delicate and the dish more refined 
in texture (no tough skins in it). Pressure cookers are very popular 
in India, especially for cooking beans, as they shorten the cooking 
time and reduce the amount of fuel needed.

<h2 id="lentil" class=h1>Lentils</h2>
<p></p>
[<i>Lens culinaris</i>] &nbsp; Probably originating in Turkey and/or 
Syria, these pulses are smaller than most beans and disk shaped rather 
than bean shaped. Optical lenses take their name from this shape. Lentils 
were one of the very first cultivated crops, probably more than 9000 
years ago, and are now grown worldwide with varieties in different sizes 
and colors. They are commonly sold dried: whole, peeled, and peeled and 
split. Cooking times are less than for beans, particularly in dal (peeled 
and split) form so whole lentils are soaked for less time than beans and 
peas, and dal form is often not soaked before cooking. In India small 
beans of genus <a href="bp_legumev.html#asian"><i>Vigna</i></a> are sometimes called 
"lentils".
<p>Lentils are high in fiber and protein, and significant sources of
folate, thiamin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, phosphorus, iron and 
zinc. The largest growers and exporters of lentils are Canada (33%) and 
India (25%). Australia, Turkey and Nepal are also significant growers.

   These olive green peas, somewhat larger than Green Peas, are cooked 
   up into a lumpy green paste in Northern England and served as "Mushy 
   Peas", often with fish and chips or as part of the snack "Pie and 
   Peas". They may also be served in cups with mint sauce as a snack at 
   fairs and events. Unlike Green Peas, they are allowed to dry on the 
   vine before harvesting.</p>
   <p>These peas are also grown as a minor crop in Canada, but the photo 
   specimens were from Ireland. Size typically 0.34 inch diameter. They 
   are Bachelors brand ordered on-line for 2019 US $7.94 / pound (2ea

   These are edible pod peas but thick and round rather than flat as the 
   Snow Pea is. They have become popular not only for their good taste, 
   raw or lightly cooked but with gardeners because edible yield is so 
   much greater than English peas. Just trim off the stem end and the 
   rest is 100% edible. Individual peas are 0.35 to 0.4 inch diameter 
   and the pods are generally about 3 to 3-1/2 inches long. The pod is 
   sweeter than that of the Snow Pea.

   Probably originating in Paraguay or Bolivia, this bean has been in 
   cultivation for about 7,600 years in Peru. The peanut plant has a 
   unique way of ripening its pods - forcing them underground at an early 
   stage, where they remain until the plant withers and dies. Then they 
   sprout. Peanuts are very nutritious and protective against a number 
   of serious diseases.</p>
   <p>Peanuts were carried from South America to Africa, India and 
   Southeast Asia by European traders and became very popular in all 
   those regions. They were brought to North America from Africa, 
   resulting in the name "goober" (from Bantu <i>nguba</i>) in the

   Origin of this bean is not known, but is probably within the current

   but can hold up to three. The seeds are about 3/8 by 1/4 inch and may

[Bhatt (India); Soya Bean (UK); <i>Glycine max</i>]
<p>
Soybeans are probably native to China and have been important to 
agriculture there since the earliest times - but not as a food crop. The 
beans were planted as a fallow field rotation crop to fix nitrogen and 
restore fertility to the fields, then plowed under. The photo specimens 
include whole fresh pods, fresh beans (edamame), dried white beans, 
black beans, and our ever present red kidney bean for scale.</p>

<p>During the Chou Dynasty (1132-246 BCE) techniques were developed to 
create soy sauce, miso and other soy products detoxified by fermentation. 
A little later a method was developed to make a soybean cheese from 
finely ground soybeans by precipitating solids with a salt - the product 
we know as tofu. Most, (but not all) of the toxins are discarded with the 
liquid. Fresh soybeans see limited use as appetizers and soybean sprouts 
see considerable use, especially in Korea, but not so much as mung bean 
sprouts.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief in the US, Asians eat soy products, 
including tofu and sprouts, only in moderation and not as a really 
significant part of their diets. Soybeans themselves have only been 
eaten in times of famine.</p>
<p>The vast bulk of soybean production is used to produce oil which may 
be used as cooking oil or for other purposes. This oil is high in 
polyunsaturates so exposure to heat should be strictly limited. Once the 
oil has been chemically extracted the solids left are used for animal 
feed and as the basis for many modern soy products, some of 
controversial safety.</p>

<p>
This small bean probably originated in India where 80% of the world's 
supply is grown. They are also grown in California, mostly for guar gum but 
some are diverted to Indian markets. They are sold when mature but the pods 
are still green so they can be cooked as a vegetable.</p>
<p>Guar gum, with about 7 times the thickening power of corn starch, is made 
by grinding mature beans. It is widely used in commercial food processing 
and for various industrial uses.

<p>
Coral Trees are found worldwide, They are often planted as decoratives, 
to replenish nitrogen, to shade other crops, and as support for 
vanilla bean vines. They are generally quite toxic, containing 
strong alkaloids, but some parts of some are eaten. Other parts of 
several are used medicinally. Seeds of some are used as rat poison, 
and bark as fish poison. The part most eaten is the flower, which is 
slightly narcotic and sleep inducing. Young leaves and buds are also 
sometimes eaten, but the beans of only one are edible. These beans

<p>In India fenugreek seed is toasted and included in a number of 
important <i>masalas</i> (spice mixes) and it is also used in the 
cuisines of the Middle East, Persia and Greece. The fresh green leaves 
and stems are also used as an herb in these same regions, and dried

<p>
This shrub or small tree (to 65 feet) is native to the Mayan region of 
southern Mexico and northern Central America (the Yucat&aacute;n region), 
but is now naturalized throughout the tropics. In the 1970s and 1980s it 
was promoted as a "miracle tree" due to its fast growth (more than 20 
feet in two to three years, and usefulness as animal fodder, firewood, 
charcoal, fiber, green manure, erosion control, general biomass, and 
human food. It is now a serious invasive in some regions. They can grow 
as far north as Southern California but do not fruit well here.</p>

<p>In the stage these are commonly sold here in California, the pods 
are about 10 or 11 inches long and just a shade less than 1 inch wide. 
The beans themselves average about 0.50 inch long and 0.32 inch wide. 
The pods will be green with speckles on the shade side and a reddish 
brown on the sunny side. Like most beans, they are slightly toxic when 
mature, but young beans can be eaten raw. Some describe the taste as 
"garlicky", but to me, it is reminiscent of 
<a href="bp_satawz.html"><b>Sataw Beans</b></a>, but not as extreme - 
perhaps that's why they've caught on in Southeast Asia where sataw beans 
are eaten. The clusters of flat pods are even similar, except sataw pods 
are twisted, not straight.

This tree is named for the sweetness of the green pulp of unripe pods. 
It is native to the entire Mississippi valley drainage region and extends 
a ways into Texas in the southwest. The unripe pods were used as food by 
the American Indians, and they can also be brewed into a sort of beer.
It is a popular tree to plant in northern climates, like Washington 
state, but thornless varieties are preferred because the long needle 
sharp thorns on the trunks of thorny ones are really, really nasty.

<p>
This very small bean is little known in the West but is a major food crop in 
arid parts of India. It's eaten as whole beans, sprouts and meal, and noted 
for its distinctive earthy flavor. The name, however, comes from its wide use 
as fodder for horses and cattle. A common method of use is to boil the gram 
until done, drain off the liquid for human use and feed most of the drained 
gram to the livestock. A small amount may go into the recipe with the liquid. 
Horse gram cooking liquid is said to be useful for dissolving kidney stones 
but no medical studies seem to be available.

   and 4 inches wide. A family that picks some pods will likely open 
   them and suck off the sweet white aril as with other ice cream beans, 
   but the beans are not discarded. They are cooked and eaten with lime

   that reach North America are just the beans, lightly pickled. They 
   can be eaten as an appetizer directly from the jar.</p>

Known as "the plant that ate the South", Kudzu is an extremely fast 
growing bean - as much as 12 inches per day! It was brought from southern 
Japan to the southeastern U.S. for cattle forage and erosion control - 
a move universally regretted, as it has taken over whole counties. It 
smothers all the native vegetation including large trees (it can climb 
over 90 feet) and is immune to common herbicides, which it seems to think 
are fertilizer.</p>
<p>Kudzu is edible, the leaves are used as cooked greens, the flowers 
battered and fried as squash flowers are, and the huge root tubers as 
root vegetables and powdered as a thickening agent (called Japanese 
arrowroot). The flowers produce a lot of nectar which is found desirable 
by bees, butterflies and other pollinating insects. The whole plant can 
be used to manufacture ethanol and grazing animals are quite fond of the 
leaves. All in all a very useful plant but currently under-utilized and

   Native to the Andean region of Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, this Lupin 
   has been used for food in that region for 6000 years that we know of. 
   It was a major food in the region until the Spanish conquest, which 
   brought changes to food practices. It is now regaining attention, 
   particularly as a food for other regions with difficult growing 
   conditions. The seed coat contains bitter, toxic alkaloids, but 
   effort is under way to produce "sweet" varieties that are reliably 
   free of the alkaloids.</p>
   <p>The small white beans are very 
   high in protein (40%) and fat (20%), and complements the protein 
   deficiencies of grains, like corn, with which it is often cooked. 
   It is used also in soups, stews and salads. The bitter, toxic 
   alkaloids can be largely removed by soaking for several days in 
   water. These beans have been used commercially, pressed for their 
   edible oil content. As a crop, these plants also renew the nitrogen 
   content of the soil.

There is also at least one species in Africa and a few in Asia.</p> 
<p>In North America the most notable species is the Honey Mesquite 
native to most of Mexico and Texas, and significant in the southern 
parts of California, Arizona and New Mexico. It also grows rather well 
outside it's native range and is rated by the IUCN as one of the 100 
worst invasive species.  It has been very important to the Seri people 
of northwestern Mexico who use the beans at various stages of ripening 
and the wood for cooking them. Dried beans can be ground into flour for 
various uses and have been described as having "a rich, caramel and nutty 
flavor". Because it grows very fast, this is a major species for charcoal 
for grilling.

The photo is of my Gold Medallion tree, <i>Senna leptophylla</i>. 
These are from southern Brazil and are seen blooming profusely all over 
Southern California in early Summer. It is quite similar to the 
<i>Senna siamea</i> of Thailand, the only one used in cuisine, and 
Thailand is pretty much the only place it is used. In Thailand both 
leaves and flower buds are used in soups, curries and the like. Leaves 
and buds are available lightly pickled in jars here in Los Angeles. 
Young pods and seeds are also said to be edible, but must be boiled 
and the water discarded. Various parts of this tree are also used 
medicinally.

Native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the tamarind tree was known to 
the ancient Egyptians, and taken to India so long ago even botanists 
thought it was native there. From India it was introduced to Persia and 
the Arab world, thus Arabic "tamar hindi" (Indian date). It is now 
planted throughout the tropics and sub-tropics including Mexico, Central 
America, the Caribbean and southern Florida.  It is an important sweet /
sour flavoring ingredient in many cuisines.

This tropical bean may have originated in Madagascar, but is now grown 
throughout the Asian tropics. The pods are the most common part used for 
food, but the tuberous roots are also quite popular. New varieties from 
China are now making it possible to grow these in warm temperate regions. 
The seeds from mature pods, high in protein and oil, are eaten, but 
require long cooking to destroy trypsin inhibitors. Flowers and leaves 
are also edible and quite high in protein.

are up to 19 inches long and contain 6 to 10 glossy seeds up to 
2-3/4 inches long. They are sufficiently toxic to be used as arrow 
poison and to poison fish. On the other hand, after processing, they 
are used as a flavoring ingredient and salad item. An edible oil can 
be extracted from the seeds, but it is mostly used to make soap and 
candles. Various parts of the tree are used medicinally.

<p>
This tree, which can grow to about 49 feet high, is native to semi-desert 
regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Oman, Pakistan and the west coast of 
India. These trees produce about 5 seeds per pod, which are dried and 
used locally for food, but this tree is most noted for producing Gum 
Arabic, also called Acacia Gum, which is used as a stabilizer in food 
processing (E414). That from the White Acacia, called locally hashab gum, 
is considered superior to that of the Red Acacia, called talh gum.  
During the rainy season the trees exude sap from cuts in the bark, which 
is gathered after it hardens, about 7 to 10 ounces per tree. Sudan, Chad 
and Nigeria produce 95% of the world's supply.

<p>
This large canopy tree, growing to 100 feet high, is widespread in the 
Caribbean, Central and South America. It is best known in North America 
as luxury grade wood flooring, but provided important food for the 
indigenous peoples of its native region. This tree is in the same 
Subfamily as the Tamarind tree. All <i>Hymenaea</i> species are native 
to the American tropics, except one species, <i>H. verrucosa</i> that is 
native to East Africa, differing in having rather warty looking pods.</p>
<p> The hard mature pods contain one or more seeds surrounded by a dry 
fibrous pulp, but the fibers dissolve readily in water and act as a 
thickener. The pulp is sweet and its food value is very high, having 
lots of starch and protein but little water. It can be eaten raw, or 
powdered to use as an ingredient in baked goods, soups, stews and 
beverages, including fermented beverages. Some are put off by the smell, 
but it is not considered offensive by people who eat it regularly. 
Other species of the tree are similarly used but not as widely.

<p>
This flowering tree native to Southeast Asia can grow to 85 feet high. 
It produces pods containing 5 to 7 large black beans containing a soft 
kernel 1 to 1-1/2 inches across, which is extracted for food. It has a 
disagreeable odor, causes bad breath, body odor smelling of urine, and 
sometimes gout, unary obstruction, severe pain and acute kidney failure, 
mainly in men. Despite all this, these beams are a very popular food in 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma and southern Thailand. It is also reputed to 
be an effective treatment for diabetes.</p> 
<p>Kidney and urinary problems are very erratic and seem unrelated to 
method of preparation. A person who has eaten them many times without 
problems can come down with kidney failure the next time. Young, these 
beans are eaten raw. When older they are used as satay or in curries, 
including the dry meat curry rendang. Personally, I'm not enthused about 
trying these, my kidneys are very important for the processing of beer.

This bean is very important in the Kalahari region of southern Africa 
where it is native. The foliage is based on a large root tuber which 
can reach a weight of at least 610 pounds. This large root allows the 
plant to sprout a huge amount of foliage in the spring. The tubers are 
edible from plants 1 to 2 years old. After that they become astringent 
and fibrous. The bean pods are about 2-1/2 inches long and contain a 
single dark brown bean weighing about 0.9 ounces. These beans are very 
high in both protein and oil.	The beans are usually roasted, giving them 
a taste similar to cashews or chestnuts. Some attempts are being made 
to grow these beans outside their native region.

fruit also is attached directly to the trunks. These fruits are hard 
shelled pods up to 4 inches long and roughly half moon shaped. As 
they ripen they turn color from green brown to yellow brown.</p>
<p>The pods contain a single seed, similar in shape to the pod, which

Native to the central North American Great Plains, from Manitoba, Canada 
to Texas, and from Montana to Wisconsin, this plant grows from tuberous 
roots. The roots were gathered wild by various tribes of American Indians 
and eaten raw or cooked, but most commonly dried for grinding into flour.

frybread.</p>
<p>The tubers are nutritious, with a relatively high protein 
content and plenty of vitamin C, which was important to Plains Indians 
who ate mostly buffalo in the winter.  They were also eaten by European 
settlers when other foods were in short supply. The plant takes 2 to 
4 years to develop a mature tuber, which has discouraged cultivation.

   [Tuberous pea, Tuberous vetchling, Aardaker; <i>Lathyrus tuberosus</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native to wet regions of Europe and Western Asia. It has 
   been cultivated as a food crop since at least the 17th century, but is 
   hampered by low yield. The elongated root tubers, from 1-1/2 to 2 
   inches long, are palatable and nutritious.

   This plant is native to the mountain regions of the Caucasus, 
   particularly Georgia. The recipe I have for it was written in Georgia 
   during the Soviet era and is not very informative, but interpreting 
   the steps given, it is apparently young seed pods that are used. In 
   this case they are simmered in a soup.

   <p>
   This bean, native to the Greek island of Santorini and nearby islands 
   has been cultivated for 3500 years and now has a DOM (Protected 
   Designation of Origin) rating from the European Union. It is adapted 
   to the specific volcanic soil and probably wouldn't grow well 
   elsewhere. It is, however, a very risky crop, wiped out by weather 
   some years, and sold at a high price.</p>
   <p>Using a special procedure, the seeds are soaked in water, then 
   boiled with onion and skimmed until a porridge is formed. It is then 
   beaten into a jelly, which is salted and boiled again. It is finally 
   served with chopped onion, olive oil and lemon juice.

   <p>
   Grass Pea grows well under drought conditions and is sometimes the only 
   food available in parts of Ethiopia, Pakistan, India and Nepal. It is 
   nutritious and high in protein, but contains a neurotoxin that causes    
   paralysis, particularly of the legs. People in affected  areas can 
   either die now of starvation or risk living the rest of their lives as 
   cripples, not a comfortable choice. The neurotoxin is not highly 
   dangerous unless Grass Pea is a major part of your diet.

   [Bitter Vetch (not unique); <i>Lathyrus linifolius</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Europe and parts of Asia, root tubers of this plant were 
   used as food in the Scottish Highlands when food was scarce, until 
   arrival of the potato. The tubers were dried for future use. Eating 
   them had a noteworthy effect which has caused them to be of great 
   interest today, and attempts are being made to cultivate the plant.
   The tubers not only provided nutrition, but had a strong appetite 
   suppression effect, which could last for days. If cultivation works 
   out, this plant could be very big in the always profitable weight 
   loss market.

   [Yellow Pea, Yellow-flowered Pea, <i>Lathyrus aphaca</i>, also

   <p>
   This plant, native to Southern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, 
   and invasive in Northern Europe and North America, is not significant 
   for human food, though it may be harvested as animal fodder. It is 
   listed here because on Wikipedia "Yellow Pea" links to 
   <i>Lathyrus aphaca</i>, not to the edible <a href="bp_legumev.html#peay"><b>Yellow 
   Peas</b></a>. Other sites have taken this botanical name for the edible 
   Yellow Pea. Yellow Vetchling produces seeds only about 3mm in size and 
   only immature pods should be eaten as mature seeds are fairly high in 
   neurotoxins.

<p>
This small bean tree (to 50 feet) or shrub is native to West and Central 
Africa, and used in many ways in the region. Fruit is eaten raw or 
cooked, and the pulp is dried and ground into flour. Seeds are used as 
a thickener and flavoring in soups and stews, particularly in Nigeria, 
or are added whole as a vegetable. The leaves and flower are also used 
as condiments or vegetables.

<br><img src="img/bp_tonka01h.jpg" alt="Split Tonka Bean Fruit" width="220" height="166" class=mrg>
[<i>Dipteryx odorata</i>]
<p>
These beans come from a tree that grows up to 100 feet high. It is 
native to Central America and is cultivated in Venezuela, Brazil and 
Colombia, but the second largest producer, after Venezuela, is now 
Nigeria in Africa. The photo shows a typical fruit with a single seed 
in its center. Held in a hand, it appears to be about 1-1/2 inches 
diameter. When mature and dried, the seeds are wrinkled black on the 
outside and smooth brown inside.</p> 
<p>These seeds have an aroma similar to Sweet Woodruff. It was 
formerly widely used as a vanilla substitute, but is now banned as a 
food additive in many countries because the aroma comes from Coumarin. 
This chemical is used to make anticoagulants like warfarin, a 
prescription drug and rat poison. It is still used in France for perfume 
and in some deserts and stews. Coumarin itself is not an anticoagulant, 
just the feed-stock for manufacturing them. The main importer is the 
United States, where it is used as an aromatic addition to pipe tobacco 
and other tobacco products.

<p>
These fruits have a sweet-sour taste similar to Tamarind, but a little 
sweeter. The brittle pods are 1 to 2 inches long depending on variety 
and contain usually one seed, sometimes two. The smaller variety contains 
pulp that is dry, almost powdery, while the larger has fairly dry but 
sticky pulp, described as tasting like "3 parts dates, 1 part raisins 
and 1 part flour". Both varieties are sold as snacks by street vendors.

[Water Mimosa, Sensitive Neptunia; <i>Neptunia oleracea</i>]
<p>
This is one of the "sensitive plants" which fold up their leaves if 
touched. Its point of origin is unknown, possibly southern Mexico or 
northern South America, but it is cultivated as a vegetable in 
Southeast Asia. It grows on wet banks near streams, or floating on the 
water where the water is still. Young leaves, tender shoots and pods 
are eaten raw as a vegetable or used as ingredients in curries and the 
like in Thailand and Cambodia. The taste is similar to cabbage.

[<i>Cordeauxia edulis</i>]
<p>
This shrub has long been essential to survival of Somali nomads, and 
once dominated the flora of much of Somalia and parts of southeast 
Ethiopia. Today it has been reduced to a few patches due to 
over-exploitation, war, drought and particularly grazing. It is making 
some recovery since the government has forbidden grazing in some regions. 
Some cultivation is being tried. Yellow flowers produce short brown pods 
containing a single large seed. The seeds are sour fresh or dried, and 
a little toxic, but after roasting the taste is similar to chestnuts. 
They are also often boiled, and the sweet water they were boiled in is 
used as a beverage. Locals sometimes use the leaves for tea.
