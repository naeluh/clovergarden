<h2 id="gen">Terms <small>&amp;</small>Definitions</h2>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Bean:</h3> &nbsp; The seeds of beans are generally elongated or 
  even rectangular. Distinctly different genera originated in China, 
  India, the Americas, and the Mediterranean (see our 
  <a href="bp_legume.html#gen"><b>General &amp; History</b></a>) page.
  </li>
<li><h3>Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Dhall] &nbsp; An Indian term that most commonly 
  indicates the peeled and split form of dried Pulses (Beans, Peas and 
  Lentils). Unfortunately, in India they are very sloppy with terms, so 
  some things they call "Dal" are not split and peeled, and some small 
  Beans are called "Lentils". On the Clovegarden site, we are more strict 
  on these terms, and here North American "Split Peas" are categorized 
  as "Dal". Dal is also the word for a finished dish of cooked Dal, 
  particularly in Southern India.</li>
<li><h3>Sabut:</h3> &nbsp; An Indian term indicating a whole unpeeled 
  bean, pea or lentil - not widely used.</li>
<li><h3>Gram:</h3> &nbsp; An Indian term that most commonly indicates the 
  whole unpeeled form of dried Pulses, but loosely used and sometimes 
  refers to the peeled and split form.</li>
<li><h3>Legumes:</h3> &nbsp; On the Clovegarden site, we use the 
  botanical definition of "legumes", meaning fruits of all members of the 
  <i>Fabaceae</i> (the Bean family). To a French chef, "legumes" means 
  only whole pods, such as green beans.</li>
<li><h3>Lentil:</h3> &nbsp; The seeds of lentils are flattened and lens 
  shaped. Lentils probably originated in western Asia. In India the 
  dal forms of some small beans are called "lentil" even though they 
  are not.</li>
<li><b>Pea:</b> &nbsp; Peas proper are members of the species Pisum 
  sativum, with generally round seeds, but the term is also used for a 
  number of beans with round seeds. Peas proper probably originated in 
  Western Asia.</li>
<li><b>Pulse:</b> &nbsp; This is a collective term for the edible seeds 
  of all Beans, Peas and Lentils.</li> 
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="meas">Measures</h2>

<p><img src="img/measures03s.jpg" alt="Measuring Devices" class=mrg>
These measures were determined for canned and dried Pinto Beans. The 
equivalents for dried to canned for other beans may vary some, but this 
is a good guide.</p>

<h3>Canned Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are most often purchased in 14 ounce 
cans. A can will usually contain 1-1/2 cups of beans. Drained and rinsed, 
they will weigh about 9-1/2 ounces. This equivalent to about 2/3 cup 
of dried beans.<p></p>

<h3>Dried Beans:</h3> &nbsp; To get the equivalent of a 14 ounce can of 
beans, soak and cook 4-1/2 ounces (2/3 cup) of dried beans. <p></p>
<br>

<h2 id="dry">Dried Beans <small>&amp;</small> Peas</h2>
<p></p>

<p><a href="../recipes/gtp_beandry1.html">
<img src="img/bp_drymix03c.jpg" alt="Mixed Dried Beans" class=mrg></a>
This section has been replaced by a separate document for easy 
reference to this important issue. See 
<a href="../recipes/gtp_beandry1.html"><b>Cooking Dried Beans</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="can">Canned Beans <small>&amp;</small> Peas</h2>

<p><img src="img/bp_can02s.jpg" alt="Can of Red Kidney Beans" class=mrg>
Canned beans are dried beans that have been soaked and cooked by 
industrial processes. There are a few exceptions, such as Green Pigeon 
Peas, which are canned before they dry. This is also the case with 
Green Peas.</p>

<h3>Canned Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These can be a great convenience when you 
are strapped for time. Though starting with dried beans yourself will 
usually yield better results, canned beans are pretty good, but vary 
with brand. Find a good brand for your type of beans and stick with it. 
The common 14 ounce can will yield about 1-1/2 cups of beans, drained 
and rinsed, which will weigh about 9-1/2 ounces.<p></p>

<h3>Canned Green Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These are absolutely necessary for 
replicating the dismal cuisines of Soviet Russia and Eisenhower era 
America. Brands in glass jars from Russia and other former Soviet 
countries are widely available here in Southern California for just that 
purpose. Otherwise, there's little excuse (unless you are stocking a 
remote cabin with no refrigeration). Use Frozen Green Peas.<p></p>

<h3>Canned Green Pigeon Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These are not peas, but African 
beans. Unlike most canned beans they are not dried before cooking and 
canning, and are minimally cooked. They are a good resource for African, 
Indian, and Caribbean cuisines, as frozen Pigeon Peas not available outside 
of communities with strong Caribbean or Indian influence. They work well 
in soups, stews and even salads. Goya is the dominant brand, and better than 
others I've tried - if you can ignore their public endorsement of Trump.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; As with other food storage, a cool place is 
best. By 2 years, canned beans will have degraded somewhat, likely 
darker in color and less firm. If the can is swollen, at all, discard 
the contents, unless you want to die painfully.<p></p>
<br>

<h2 id=froz>Frozen Peas <small>&amp;</small> Beans</h2>

<p><p><img src="img/bp_froze02c.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Frozen Peas and Beans" class=mrg>
Not all types of peas and beans are available frozen, but a number 
of those often used as Fresh Shell Beans are. Frozen beans are lightly 
cooked for the freezing process, but remaining cooking time will vary by 
type.</p>

<h3>Frozen Green Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These are fantastic for a huge number 
of recipes that call for fresh garden peas - the next best thing and a 
whole lot less expensive and perishable - and available year round. They 
have been lightly cooked for freezing, so add to the recipe for just the 
last couple minutes. For soups and stews that are reheated, they will 
loose their bright green color, but will still taste fine.<p></p>

<h3>Frozen Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Lima Beans and Black Eyed Peas are widely 
available frozen. They need more cooking time than Frozen Green Peas, 
but not as much as fresh shell beans. You have to sample them, to see if 
they are done, so include a few more than your recipe requires.
<p></p>

<h3>Frozen Green Pigeon Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These are not Peas, but African 
Beans. In North America, they are reasonably available in regions with 
significant Caribbean populations, but can also be found in the freezer 
cases of well-stocked Indian markets, The substitute is Canned Green Pigeon 
Peas, but they're still pretty good, as they're canned as shell beans, not 
dried and re-hydrated like other canned beans.
<p></p>

<h3>Frozen Fava Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are widely available in our 
ethnic markets, both shelled and shelled and skinned. They are a great 
convenience, and far more economical than buying Favas in the pod. Like 
other frozen beans, you need to sample them during cooking to see if 
they are done.
<p></p>

<h3>Edamame:</h3> &nbsp; These are immature soy beans, available in the 
pod and shelled. These beans have not yet developed the full soy suite 
of enzymes and toxins, so are safe to eat in moderate quantity. They 
are par boiled before freezing, and generally boiled, steamed or 
microwaved just before eating, which reduces what toxins there might 
be to safe levels.
<p></p>

<h3>Frozen Green Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are a "convenience" product, 
not really necessary due to easy availability of fresh green beans all 
year. They are mostly cooked for the freezing process, so add them near 
the end of cooking.<p></p>
<br>


<h2 id="pod">Pod Beans</h2>
<p></p>

<p><img src="img/bp_podmix02c.jpg" alt="Pile of Various Pod Beans" class=mrg>
Pod Beans, including green beans, romano beans, and the like, are 
immature beans that are still developing in their pods. They do not yet 
contain significant amounts of the sugars and toxins that are problems 
in mature beans. They are cooked and consumed pod and all. Note that 
many beans have slightly to very toxic pods, so only eat those that 
are commonly sold for eating in this form.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Pod Beans purchased fresh will keep for 4 to 6 
days refrigerated, loosely bagged in plastic. Make sure there is no free 
water on the beans before packaging and refrigerating, and remove any 
that are damaged (damaged areas can be cut away with a razor sharp knife).
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The standard method of cooking pod beans is to 
first cut them to the desired configuration. Then drop them into boiling 
salted water and cook them until just crisp tender. They should then be 
drained and immediately refreshed under cold running water. Add them 
to recipes near the end of cooking. This method preserves their color 
and nutrients, and keeps them from becoming mushy.<p></p>
<br>



<h2 id="shell">Shell Beans</h2>

<p><img src="img/bp_shellmx03c.jpg" alt="Several Common Shell Beans" class=mrg>
Shell beans are mature pod beans. The pods have probably started to 
dry, but the beans in the pods have not dried. These may be sold shelled 
or in the pod (particularly peas and sometimes black eyed peas).  
Issues of toxicity and flatulence are not as severe as for dried 
beans, but greater than for pod beans.</p>

<p>Shell beans are relatively expensive from local producers because 
shelling them at this stage is much more tedious than for dried beans. 
They are considerably more affordable purchased frozen, as larger 
producers have developed industrial methods for shelling them and 
distribution frozen is far more practical than fresh.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These beans will need a lot longer cooking than 
Pod Beans, but quite a bit less than even soaked dried beans. The only 
way to be sure is to sample them, so start cooking a 
few more than your recipe calls for.<p></p>

<h3>Fresh Garden Peas:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most popular form of 
"Shell Beans", and far easier to shell than other beans. They are not 
bitter raw and need less than 10 minutes of cooking, so add them to 
recipes very late.<p></p>

<h3>Fava Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are widely available "in the 
pod" here in Southern California due to our large communities from 
the Mediterranean and Near and Middle East. They end up being quite 
costly after shelling, and the skins need to be removed form individual 
beans after cooking (easily done). Fortunately, Frozen Fava Beans are 
also widely available, both shelled and shelled and skinned. Very young 
Fava Beans that can be cooked pod and all are not available here.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp;  Beans at this stage are quite perishable and 
subject to mold. They will keep for 4 to 6 days refrigerated in a 
plastic bag. Make sure there is no free water on the beans before 
packaging and refrigerating.<p></p>
<br>

<h2 id=lent>Lentils</h2>
<p></p>

<p><img src="img/bp_lentmix02c.jpg" alt="Several Lentil Varities" class=mrg>
This section applies only to whole, skin-on lentils. For red lentils 
or other peeled and split lentils, see <a href="bp_legumew.html#dal"><b>Dal</b></a>.
</p>

<h3>Soaking:</h3> &nbsp; These are small beans with a lenticular shape. 
Their skins are thinner and the soaking (or brining) can fully penetrate 
easily, since it doesn't have far to go. For this reason, lentils may 
not be soaked at all, or soaked for just 2 hours or so.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Lentils are often just added to a soup recipe 
at the beginning of cooking and the soup is done when they are tender.
For soups and stews I generally use the smallest Green Lentils, because 
they hold their shape much better in cooking than the larger green and 
brown ones. Contrarily, use the largest ones if you want a creamier 
effect.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Considerations for storage are the same as for 
dried beans, but the small size and thin skin makes them somewhat more 
vulnerable. They can become difficult to cook in less than 2 years. 
A long brining and long cooking may help if the problem isn't too 
severe.
<p></p>
<br>


<h2 id=dal>Dal</h2>
<p></p>

<p><img src="img/bp_dalmix05c.jpg" alt="Several Varities of Dal" class=mrg>
Dal (or Dhall, etc.) is an Indian word for split and peeled beans, 
peas and lentils. Unfortunately, in India they are not consistent, so 
some unpeeled pulses are called "dal". On the Clovegarden site we are 
strict, and categorize even North American split peas as "Dal". In 
India they are called "Mater Dal".</p>

<h3>Soaking:</h3> Split and peeled Dal is not soaked. If an Indian 
recipe calls for soaking a Dal, it is probably one that is called 
"Dal" even though whole with skin on. Red lentils are always "dal" 
whether called that or not.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Dal is very fast cooking. In southern India, 
they prefer to cook dal to mush, but I prefer it to have more texture, 
so I ignore their cooking times.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Considerations for storage are the same as for 
dried beans, but the small size and thin or no skin makes them somewhat 
more vulnerable. Some sites say rehydration problems are caused by oil 
in the skins of beans oxidizing, but I've had Chana Dal and Toor Dal 
(with no skin) become impossible to cook tender in less than 2 years.
<p></p>
<br> 

<h2 id="spr">Bean Sprouts</h2>

<p><a href="bp_sproutz.html">
<img src="img/bp_sproutsm02c.jpg" alt="Mung and Soy Bean Sprouts" class=mrg></a>
Sprouting significantly changes the taste, texture and nutritional 
makeup of beans. Protein and Vitamin C are increased, while phytic 
acid and trypsin inhibitor are decreased. Protein digestibility also 
improves. These changes have mostly occurred by time the sprouts are 
1/2 inch long.  For details see our <a href="bp_sproutz.html">
<b>Bean Sprouts</b></a> page, which also has instruction on sprouting 
them.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id=health class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition.</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Flatulence:</h3> &nbsp; This feature of beans, particularly dried 
beans, bothers many people, but is not noted as a problem with 
populations who eat beans very regularly. Those with strong exposure 
appear to have acquired enzymes that help digest the sugars that cause 
the problem. Soaking the beans and discarding the cooking water can 
reduce flatulence because the indigestible sugars responsible are water 
soluble. This does, however, reduce the flavor somewhat.

<p>A substance called "Beano" is marketed to reduce flatulence - you 
don't add it to recipes but take some along with the beans. Some herbs, 
particularly Epazota, cooked with the beans, are said to help.</p>

<p>The real cure is simple, healthy and cheap. Eat a diet rich in beans 
and cabbages which will build up your ability to process these sugars. 
Cultures that eat a lot of beans don't generally ascribe flatulence 
to them.</p>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Beans are high in protein (dried beans are 
about 20% protein), but it is not complete, lacking methionine. 
This can be completed by grains. Vegetarians should consume beans and 
grains together, or within 12 hours of each other to balance the protein. 
At one time it was thought necessary to eat them both at the same meal, 
but that has been shown unnecessary. They also offer a good selection of 
vitamins and minerals, but beans in storage for much more than a year 
have pretty much lost their vitamin content.<p></p>

<h3>Toxicity:</h3> &nbsp; Most beans are at least slightly toxic, but 
toxicity is reduced to insignificant levels by normal cooking. Lima 
beans should be cooked in an open pot, at least at the start, to allow 
any cyanide to evaporate. Frozen Limas have already been cooked long 
enough to detox, and dried Limas are cyanide free. Other beans, notably 
soy beans and grass peas have more complex and difficult to resolve 
toxicity issues. 
<p><b><u>Caution</u>:</b> &nbsp; Fresh or Dried Red Kidney Beans are 
seriously toxic. Regular stovetop cooking will detox them in 10 minutes 
at a boil - <u>but</u> they must not be cooked in a slow cooker, 
especially set to low. They can become up to <u>5 times</u> as toxic 
as uncooked. White Kidney Beans are less toxic, but caution is still 
advised.</p>
<p>Pods of some edible beans are toxic and should not be consumed - 
stick with those generally sold as edible. Some lima beans are so 
toxic the FDA won't allow them to be imported or sold in the U.S., 
and many bean plants are very toxic indeed, so it's best not to 
experiment with wild beans you don't know.<p></p>

<h3>Soy Bean Problems:</h3> &nbsp; Soybeans and many soy products are 
considered unsafe by some researchers. These products contain vegetable 
estrogens, toxins, mineral blockers and other substances that may cause 
health and child development problems. Traditionally, soy is eaten in 
moderation and only in fermented (miso, soy sauce) and precipitated 
(tofu) forms. For details see our
