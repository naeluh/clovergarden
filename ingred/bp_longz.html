   Unlike it's close relative the African <a href="bp_blkeyez.html">
   <b>Black-eyed Pea</b></a>, these beans are grown only for the pod. 
   These pods are much meatier than the black-eye pod, with small seeds 
   spaced far apart. The flavor is quite similar. While often called 
   Yardlong Beans they actually top out at about 28 inches. The photo 
   specimens were typically 3/8 inch in diameter and the longest was 26 
   inches, but they are commonly a little smaller.
   <p>There is also a "white" variety, actually a light yellow-green, but 
   these are less available, more expensive and found only occasionally in 
   large Asian markets.  These beans are important to the cuisines of 
   Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, so are widely grown in California.
   They are a traditional food in tropical Africa and may have originated 
   there. They have also become quite popular in Caribbean cuisines.</p>

<p>Long beans are eaten raw in salads, particularly in Thailand, where 
they will be quite sweet compared to other beans, but they are more 
commonly cooked, throughout southern India and Southeast Asia. I use them 
in African or Asian stew that calls for Green Beans, as they hold up to 
long cooking much better.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Long beans are available in markets serving 
Southeast Asian communities and around here even in regular produce 
markets and farmer's markets. Look for fairly narrow beans that are dark 
green and not at all shriveled. If overripe they will be lighter in 
color, lumpy and feel hollow. They will keep for up to 5 days loosely 
wrapped in the refrigerator.<p></p>

<h3>Substitution:</h3> &nbsp; Long beans are imperfectly interchangeable 
with green beans because the size, flavor and texture are significantly 
different. Long beans cook firmer, have a darker flavor and are 
distinctly sweet. If you must use green beans adjust the recipe for 
cooking time as green beans overcook very easily compared to long beans.
<p></p>

<h3>Health:</h3> &nbsp; Long beans are a very good 
source of  vitamin C, foliate, magnesium and manganese as well as a good 
source of protein, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, iron, phosphorus, and 
potassium.<p></p>
