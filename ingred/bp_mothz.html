<h1>Moth Beans / Matki</h1>

[Matki (India); <i>Vigna aconitifolia</i>]

These very tiny beans and their dal provide an unusual texture and an 
earthy flavor making them popular in India. They are also favored 
for sprouting, as they sprout very quickly. 1 cup of dried moth beans 
will need 2 cups of soaking water. Soak 6 hours or more. The Dal is 
not soaked before cooking. The photo specimens of Moth were typically 
0.20 inch long and 0.11 inch wide (5.1 x 2.8 mm), and the Moth Dal 
was typically 0.19 inch long and 0.06 inch thick (4.8 x 1.5 mm).

<p>Moth beans are very tolerant of growing conditions and drought 
resistant, but are grown almost entirely in India. The plants are 
short and wide, close to the ground, making harvesting more difficult 
than for most beans. They are being promoted as a crop for the Sahel, 
the semi-arid region that stretches across Africa south of the deserts.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Whole Moth Beans, are almost always available 
in Indian markets. The Dal is common, but not as common as the beans.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep beans or dal cool and dry in a sealed 
container and mark the container by date purchased. Technically they'll 
last for years without spoiling - BUT - in practice a year is about 
maximum. With age they cook less and less well until they simply will 
not soften, no matter how long you soak them and how long you cook 
them.<p></p>

<h3>Soaking &amp; Sprouting:</h3> &nbsp; These beans should be soaked 
at least 6 hours. For cooking whole beans, soak with 1/2 Tablespoon of 
salt per cup of beans. For sprouting, skip the salt. These beans, if 
fresh, sprout with great enthusiasm. They are ready to cook in about 
24 hours after soaking. Those to the left in the photo are ready 
to cook. For more on sprouting, see our 
<a href="bp_sproutm.html"><b>Sprouting Beans, Peas &amp; 
Lentils</b></a> page.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Whole soaked beans will cook in about 
30 minutes. Unsoaked they'll need 45 minutes to an hour, and they 
tend to fall apart a lot more than soaked beans.  Soaked dal should 
be cooked for around 25 minutes, depending on how soft you want it. In 
India it's normally cooked until like a thick soup, but I like more 
texture. <p></p>
