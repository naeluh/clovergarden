[Cheonggukjang (Korea)]
<p>
   Most known from Japan, this product is made by fermenting steamed 
   soybeans with a starter culture of <i>Bacillus subtilis natto</i>. 
   It has a fairly strong odor and taste, though the perception of 
   individuals vary. In Japan it is often eaten for breakfast with rice. 
   It is usually sold packaged as a stack of small single serving trays, 
   and may be frozen. Natto is considered a very healthy product both 
   in Japan and by health advocates in North America. Similar fermented 
   products, made with the same bacteria culture, are made in China, 
   Korea, Thailand, the Himalayan region, parts of India, and parts of 
   West Africa.</p>
   <p>Natto is particularly noted for its stringiness, as shown in the 
   photo - but it wasn't easy to photograph because the strings last 
   only for a few seconds</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product can be found in the refrigerated 
or frozen food sections of markets serving an Asian community, particularly 
Japanese - but Japanese markets are getting scarce as the Japanese more 
and more blend into the mainstream culture.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; This is a perishable product. It can be kept 
refrigerated for a week or so, frozen for longer periods.<p></p>
