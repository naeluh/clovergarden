[Sweet Detar, Sweet Dattock; Ofor (Nigeria (ground seeds)); 
Ntamajalan (Bambara); Dankh, Petit D&eacute;tar (French); 
Abu-laili (Sudan); Tamba Dala (Mali); <i>Detarium microcarpum</i> &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; <i>Detarium senegalense</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Detarium macrocarpum</i> 
all of Family <i>Fabaceae</i> (Beans)]
<p>
These medium to large Trees are of very similar characteristics, have very 
similar uses, and share local names:
<br><b><i>Detarium microcarpum</i></b> grows to 62 feet (19 meters) in the dry savanna 
band from Senegal in West Africa to South Sudan in East Africa. 
<br><b><i>Detarium senegalense</i></b> grows to 131 feet (40 meters in the dry 
forest band from Senegal to Nigeria. Fruit of some trees is toxic, and the 
only way to tell is that fallen fruit under a toxic tree will not be eaten by 
birds or animals.
<br><b><i>Detarium macrocarpum</i></b> grows to 196 feet (60 meters) in the moist 
forest band within Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon. Fruits are about  1-1/2 inches 
long (4 cm) and 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter.

<p>The <b>Fruit</b> can be eaten raw or cooked, but the fruit pulp is more 
commonly dried and ground to a flour, though it is also suitable for 
concentrate and jam. Fruit can be stored for years, because the sweet pulp 
is dry and fibrous, similar to the related Tamarind. 
</p>

<p><b>Seeds</b> are very popular hulled, shelled, and ground for use as a 
thickener and flavoring in soups and stews, or the kernels can be added whole 
as a vegetable. The ground form is called Ofor in Nigeria, and very popular 
there, particularly for Oha Soup.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b> are used as green vegetables, and <b>Flowers</b> are used 
condiments.</p>
