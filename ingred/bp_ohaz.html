<h1>Oha Leaves</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_pterind01g.jpg" alt="Fruit and Leaves of Pterocarpus Indicus" class=mrg>
[Oha (Nigeria); Mkula (Swahili); Padouk blanc (French); 
  <i>Pterocarpus mildbraedii</i>]
<p>
This large bean tree (to 114 feet) is native to West Africa and the 
northern part of Central Africa. The leaves are particularly used in 
soups and the like in Nigeria. The leaves contain hydrogen cyanide and 
oxalate, but not so high as to pose a danger.
The photo is actually <i>Pterocarpus indicus</i>, but the leaves and 
fruit look very much the same, and the leaves of that tree have also 
been used as a vegetable.

<p>These leaves are much used in Nigeria, particularly for use in 
in Oha Soup, which is quite popular there. They are used fresh and h
andled carefully, often as halves with the central stem removed.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These leaves can be found dried on the Internet, 
but in Nigeria they are used fresh.</p>

<p><b>Prep:</b> &nbsp; Cut these leaves only when they are about to go 
into the soup, as they blacken quickly when damaged.</p>
