<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>]</p>
<p>
Probably originating in Paraguay or Bolivia, this bean has been in 
cultivation for about 7,600 years in Peru. The peanut plant has a unique 
way of ripening its pods - forcing them underground at an early stage, 
where they remain until the plant withers and dies. Then they sprout. 
Peanuts are very nutritious and protective against a number of serious 
diseases.</p>

<p>Peanuts were carried from South America to Africa, India and 
Southeast Asia by European traders and became very popular in all those 
regions. They were brought to North America from Africa with the slave 
trade, resulting in the name "goober" (from Bantu <i>nguba</i>) in the 
American South.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="var">Varieties of Peanut</h2>

<p>While there are thousands of varieties of peanut, those grown in 
North America nearly all fall into four variety groups:
<ol>
<li><h3>Spanish:</h3> &nbsp; Relatively small and higher oil content than 
  other varieties. Used for salted nuts, peanut candy and peanut butter.
  </li>
<li><h3>Runners:</h3> &nbsp; Larger and good roasting qualities, most are 
  used to make peanut butter.</li>
<li><h3>Virginia:</h3> &nbsp; Large peanuts used for salting, confections 
  and roasting in the shell.</li>
<li><h3>Valencia:</h3> &nbsp; The preferred type for boiling. These are 
  easy to identify because they are mostly 3 seeds to a pod, tightly 
  packed and the pod has no restrictions between seeds.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 id=buy>Buying, Storing, Cooking Peanuts</h2>

<p><h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Peanuts are not hard to find in markets all over 
North America, generally sold raw blanched or unblanched, roasted in the 
shell with or without salt, and shelled roasted peanuts with or without 
salt. Raw in the shell is not commonly available outside peanut growing 
regions.
<p>The main concerns when buying peanuts are rancidity and mold. It 
is best to buy your peanuts from a source that has high turnover. 
Peanuts go rancid rather quickly fresh or roasted. They should be smelled 
and tasted for rancidity and discarded if any is present. Not only do the 
products of rancidity taste bad, some are suspected carcinogens. <u>Any</u> 
trace of mustiness or mold is grounds for immediate disposal as it may 
involve powerful toxins.</p>
<p>Peanuts bought in the shell should not smell musty or show dark spots 
or insect damage. The pods should be mostly completely closed and should 
not rattle excessively if shaken, evidence of being too dry.

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Peanuts are highly perishable in all forms and 
are vulnerable to molds that produce powerful aflatoxins. They should be 
kept in tightly sealed containers away from moisture, away from any heat 
source and should be consumed in a short period of time.<p></p>

<h3 id="cook">Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In American cuisine peanuts are 
most often roasted, but in China, India and Africa they are most often 
boiled. In both Africa and Southeast Asia, dry roasted peanuts are an 
important garnish. You should always dry roast your own raw peanuts for 
this use (see our recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/skv_peanut1.html">Dry Roasted Peanuts</a>) for 
superior flavor and texture.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/bp_peanut03h.jpg" alt="Boiled Peanuts" class=mrg>
In the American South, as in Africa, Southeast Asia and South America, 
peanuts boiled in the shell in heavily salted water are a very popular snack 
food. They are not much seen outside the growing areas because full size 
peanuts that have not yet started to dry make the best boilers, and they are 
quite perishable. Valencias are strongly preferred and a popular home garden 
item in the US South, but Virginias are sometimes used (see <a href="bp_peanutz.html#var">
Varieties</a>). Dryer peanuts can be boiled but are not as satisfactory. 
Boiled peanuts are highly perishable so should be refrigerated and eaten 
soon. The photo specimen is a very rare five seed Valencia pod shown after 
boiling.

<h2 id="heal">Health and Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Peanuts are highly nutritious, and while they 
are not nuts, they offer a benefit profile similar to nuts. They are 
suspected of or proven to have these health benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Nutrients:</h3> &nbsp; High or significant for manganese, tryptophan, 
  vitamin B3 (niacin), folate, vitamin E, copper, protein.</li>
<li><h3>Fats:</h3> &nbsp; High in heart healthy monounsaturated fats, not as 
  high as olive oil but way better than most vegetable oils.</li>
<li><h3>Antioxidants:</h3> &nbsp; Peanuts are high in antioxidants, including 
  resvrtatrol (the grape skin antioxidant). Roasting increases the amount 
  of antioxidant p-coumaric acid about 22%. Boiling fresh raw peanuts 
  (see <a href="bp_peanutz.html#cook">Cooking</a> above) greatly increases antioxidant 
  levels by absorbtion from the shell. These antioxidants are very 
  important to heart health.</li>
<li><h3>Cancer:</h3> &nbsp; Researchers in Taiwan found peanuts dramatically 
  reduced the incidence of colo-rectal cancer in women, especially those 
  who ate pickled foods. Improvement was not as dramatic in 
  men who are less vulnerable to pickled foods (at least in Taiwan). The 
  antioxidants in peanuts are suspected of being helpful in preventing other 
  cancers as well.</li>
<li><h3>Gallstones</h3> &nbsp; Peanuts are suspected of helping prevent 
  gallstone formation.</li>
<li><h3>Dementia:</h3> &nbsp; Research has shown a diet including niacin rich 
  foods slows the onset of Alzheimer's and other forms of age related 
  cognitive decline. Peanuts are relatively high in niacin.</li>
<li><h3>Calories:</h3> &nbsp; Dry roasted peanuts have only about 166 calories 
  per ounce. They are not considered a contributor to weight gain unless 
  you really overdo them. In fact they may contribute to weight loss by 
  satisfying hunger fairly quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Allergic Reactions:</h3> &nbsp; Some people, particularly children, 
have a peanut allergy, estimated to affect about 0.6% of Americans. This 
immune system over-reaction allergy can be so severe as to cause death from 
minute exposure to peanuts. The problem is highly demographic and 
concentrated in North America. It is suspected the cause is an excessively 
sterile childhood environment and lack of early childhood exposure to 
peanuts. It appears to be curable by controlled exposure and several 
studies are ongoing. Researcher feel the risk from the therapy is much 
less than a lifetime of worrying about peanut exposure.<p></p>

<h3>Aflatoxins:</h3> &nbsp; Peanuts are vulnerable to Aspergillus molds 
that produce powerful toxins also noted for being powerful carcinogens. 
These molds infect cereal grains, oilseed (including peanuts), spices 
and tree nuts. Production is continuously monitored by the FDA (Food and 
Drug Administration), USDA (U.S Department of Agriculture) and peanut 
processing companies. Any batches that do not meet FDA standards are 
destroyed.  Humans have been found extraordinarily resistant to 
aflatoxins compared to farm animals, but are still vulnerable.

<p>While the food supply seems pretty safe on this subject, it does 
point to the necessity for proper storage in the home. Vulnerable 
products need to be stored very dry in sealed containers, at low 
temperatures and for a short time.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="prod">Peanut Products</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Peanut Butter:</h3> &nbsp; This is made by a special grinding process 
from dry roasted peanuts. <b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; Because peanut butter is 
pitched so much to children, major brands are heavily laced with sugar for 
greater child appeal, and may also have trans fats added to prevent oil 
separation. <u>Do Not</u> cook with these abominations (or feed them to 
your children). Select products containing peanuts and only peanuts 
(though a little palm oil as stabilizer is not a problem, hydrogenated 
oils are).<p></p>

<h3>Peanut Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This product is available in light roast 
and dark roast and is made from partially defatted peanuts, ranging from 
12% to 28% fat. It is often used in applications that must be gluten 
free. The light is used where not much peanut flavor is desired and the 
dark where it is. I have not noticed these products in any of the markets 
here in Southern California.<p></p>

<h3>Peanut Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Refined peanut oil is considered a high grade 
cooking oil because its flavor is neutral, it has a high level of 
monounsaturated fats, and it goes to a high temperature 
(450&deg;F/230&deg;C). Though it is inferior in all respects to olive 
pomace oil it goes to a considerably higher temperature than pure olive 
oil. Neither unrefined peanut oil nor virgin olive oil should be used 
above 300&deg;F/150&deg;C.

<p>Back in the 1960s every Chinese recipe called for peanut oil, but 
due to a massive marketing campaign by the Canadian oil industry 
few food writers dare call for anything but Canola oil - the health 
impacts of which are in question.</p>

<p>Back in the early 1960s Planters dominated the peanut oil market and 
every supermarket had plenty of Planters Peanut Oil on display. Then 
Planters became a textbook case of what happens when you let MBAs handle 
a successful brand (Planters was sold to Standard Brands in 1960, which 
became part of Nabisco Brands, which became part of Kraft foods). I 
understand it has recovered to some extent in recent times, but I still 
rarely see it.</p>
