<p>
These beans, about the size and shape of large almonds, grow on large 
Southeast Asian trees in clusters of long twisted flat pods - about 16 
beans per pod. Their taste is often described as "medicinal", but actually 
it's more like rubber cement - particularly the rubber cement we used to 
patch inner tubes with back when tires had tubes. They are quite popular 
in Southern Thailand, Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia where the taste for 
them has been acquired.</p>

<p>Very young pods are eaten as a vegetable in areas where the trees grow. 
In northeastern India mature beans are dried for later use and will then 
be black in color.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Mature beans shelled 
from the pod can be found in small trays in the frozen food section of 
well stocked markets serving Southeast Asian communities.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For curries and the like, I usually put the 
beans in so they'll cook for 1/2 hour or so which will temper the flavor 
of the beans and lightly flavor the curry. They soften a bit but remain 
intact.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The only reasonable substitute is Mexican 
<a href="bp_guajez.html"><b>Guajes</b> or <b>Huajes</b></a>, which 
have a similar taste, but are much smaller and a bit milder. Beyond this 
there are only "place holders", large fresh fava or lima beans - not 
at all the same flavor, but at least they're large green beans, and may 
actually be more acceptable to the uninitiated.<p></p>
