<h1>Soaking / Brining Dried Beans</h1>

<p>
<span class=bg>Some cookbooks urge you to soak beans (usually overnight) before 
cooking - others tell you not to bother. Mexicans generally do not 
soak their beans, but writers of cookbooks for other cuisines almost 
always tell you to soak. Many writers in magazines and on-line tell 
you not to bother. All this results in considerable confusion. 
What, exactly, is the truth?</span></p>

<h3>Soaking:</h3> &nbsp; It is certainly true that dried 
beans can go directly in a pot with water and be cooked satisfactorily 
in one shot - so why soak?
<ul>
<li>Soaking beans cuts the cooking time at least in half. This will often 
  make scheduling a recipe much easier.</li>
<li>Presoaked beans tend to break up less when cooked, making for better 
  appearance.</li>
<li>You can discard the soaking liquid. It will contain some of the 
  indigestible complex sugars that result in gas generation and farting. 
  Mexicans don't care about this because they eat beans so often they've 
  developed enzimes to digest those sugars.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brining:</h3> &nbsp; This is a new take on soaking and highly 
recommended. This is a normal soak, but with 1/2 Tablespoons of 
salt per cup of beans added to the soaking water. Rinse after draining. 
The salt makes the skins more permeable resulting in beans that cook more 
quickly, more evenly and with less breaking up than with any other method. 
In my opinion it also reduces flatulence. This method, developed by the 
Cooks Illustrated kitchens, has been confirmed by other testers.<p></p>

<h3>Quick Brine:</h3> &nbsp; This method seeks the advantage 
of brining but taking less time. Put the beans in a pot with about the 
normal amount of soaking water and 1/2 Tablespoons of salt per cup of 
beans. Bring to a boil and immediately take off the heat. Set aside for 
at least an hour before draining, rinsing and cooking.<p></p> 

<h3>Lentils:</h3> &nbsp; These are rarely soaked and if they are it's for 
no longer than an hour or two. Red lentils in particular are peeled so 
they cook very fast and are never soaked.<p></p>

<h3>Dal:</h3> &nbsp; For southern Indian cooking, dal (split and peeled 
beans, peas and lentils) are not pre-soaked unless a particularly creamy 
texture is desired. In any case, dals need only a fraction of the soaking 
time of whole beans, peas and whole lentils.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Salt or no salt? Some hold that if you cook beans 
in water with salt added before they are completely cooked you will have 
tougher beans than with no salt. Tests by the Los Angeles Times kitchen 
have disproven this, and other testers are of similar opinion.<p></p>
