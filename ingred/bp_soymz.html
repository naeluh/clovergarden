<h1>Miso</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_miso01e.jpg" alt="Light and Dark Japanese Misos" class=mrg>
<p>
Fermented soybean paste was invented in China during the Chou Dynasty 
(1132-246 BCE) and was the first really successful method to render soybeans 
edible - and it also produced a very usable byproduct - tamari soy sauce. 
Both these products are too strong in flavor to be used alone, but they have 
both become indispensable flavoring ingredients - though most soy sauce is 
now made by a different process.</p>
<p>The fermenting technique was taken to Japan around 600 CE and was further 
refined there into today's miso. Originally miso was made by fermenting whole 
soybeans, but from around 1400 on it has been made from ground soybeans. 
Similar products are made in Korea and China but differ in style.</p>
<p>There are a great many misos with subtle flavor differences but for most 
purposes you need consider only the two in the photo: Shiromiso (white) and 
Akamiso (red). The other two most common types are Kuromiso (black) and 
Hatchomiso (aged or smoked) but those are a lot harder to find in the US. 
Typically the ingredients are: water, soybeans, rice, salt and alcohol. 
Other mixes of grains and/or soybeans and grains are used to make miso. 
Fermentation with koji-kin mold (<i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>) ranges in 
time from a week to several years.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Miso is found in the 
refrigerated section of markets serving Japanese and Korean communities 
and in other Asian markets. It may be packed in small plastic bags or in 
tubs.  Once purchased it should be kept refrigerated and if the packages 
are kept tightly closed it will be good for at least a year.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The most well known miso dish in the US is miso 
soup - most often made with shiro miso. In soup the miso is is added last 
and often the soup is not brought back to a full boil after adding the 
miso, though I don't find a few seconds of boiling to make much 
difference.

<p>Other than that, just follow the directions given for your recipe for 
both type of miso and cooking. Health food enthusiasts often don't add 
miso to a recipe until it has cooled in order to keep the mold culture 
alive, but this is not normally done in Japan.<p></p>

<p>Aside from soup miso is used in some pickles, along with sake as a 
marinade for fish, and as part of the liquid for braised vegetables. In 
Japan corn on the cob is often made by coating the ear lightly with shiro 
miso, wrapping it in foil and grilling it.</p>


<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Miso is high in salt which is necessary to the fermentation process and 
is of no use to persons trying to reduce their blood pressure with a salt 
free diet. Medical sources say reducing sodium has little effect until 
nearly all salt is eliminated from the diet.</p>

<p>In my non-medical opinion this sounds like treating the symptoms, not 
the disease, by creating an imbalance so extreme it happens to counter 
symptoms of the real problem. As usual, I point to demographics. Populations 
that practically live on salt, like Japan, don't seem to have that much of 
a high blood pressure problem.</p>

<p>Because natural miso is a long fermented product, it is free from the 
toxins and hormone-like substances some soy products are suspected 
of and is generally considered safe.</p>

<p>Claims that miso contains vitamin B12 (critically deficient in the 
vegan diet) have not stood up to scientific investigation. Miso has B 
vitamins but not B12, unless it has been contaminated with insects. Miso 
has been used as a treatment for radiation sickness, basically 
on hear-say evidence since controlled human studies have not been 
politically practical since the fall of the Japanese Empire.</p>
