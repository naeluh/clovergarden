<h1>Soy Sauce</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_soys01e.jpg" alt="Light and Dark" class=mrg>
  [Shoyu (Japan); Soya sauce (UK)]
<p>
For most cooks there are just two significant types, <b>Light</b> 
(Japanese or Chinese) and <b>Dark</b> (Chinese). As with beer, "Lite" 
is not the same as "Light", but probably indicates reduced salt. Also, 
for celiacs, some Tamari type sauces are made with no grain, thus gluten 
free. Additionally, you should know the difference between Naturally 
Brewed (generally considered safe) and Artificial (rather questionable) 
soy sauces.</p>

<p>In the photo, light is on the left, dark on the right. Of course to the 
specialist and epicure the world of soy sauces is a lot more complicated.

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>

<p><b>Naturally Brewed</b> soy sauce is made from soy beans and usually 
some grain such as wheat, fermented with salt, yeast, mold and bacteria. 
It is generally considered safe, and being long fermented is free from 
the toxins and hormones some non-fermented soy products are suspected 
of.</p>

<p><b>Artificial</b> soy sauce is made from hydrolized soy protein treated with 
hydrochloric acid and colored with caramel. In the US such "soy sauce" is  
generally sold in bottles with Chinese sounding names. Similar concoctions  
are sold through health food emporiums as "liquid aminos". Scientific 
investigation reveals these liquids often contain disturbing amounts of 
toxins and carcinogens.</p>

<h2>General <small>&amp;</small> International</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Light Soy Sauce</h3> is a general term for what we in North 
  America consider "normal" or Japanese style soy sauce, exemplified by 
  "Kikkoman Soy Sauce" (no additional qualifiers except "Naturally 
  Brewed"). Used in all Asian cuisines and worldwide it is usually made 
  from a mix of soybeans and wheat, ranging from about half and half to 
  heavy on the wheat. Other grains may sometimes be used.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Tamari</h3> was formerly made from the run-off from manufacturing 
  miso (fermented bean paste) but today is more likely made pretty much 
  like regular soy sauce except with less grain and more beans. Some 
  versions use no grains and are "celiac safe".<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Low Sodium Soy Sauce</h3> is a variation on light soy sauce. Many 
  prefer this as a "dipping" soy sauce for sushi and the like. It's value 
  in a low salt diet is zilch - it still has plenty of salt, but some 
  salt has been removed after normal fermentation.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Chinese</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Chinese Light Soy Sauce</h3> (<i>shangchau</i>, <i>jiang qing</i>) 
  is pretty similar to the standard Japanese soy sauce but usually with 
  more soybeans and less wheat, which makes it less sweet and also 
  somewhat darker in color. Japanese soy sauce can be substituted - 
  Kikkoman &uuml;ber alles!
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Dark Soy Sauce</h3> (<i>laochou</i>) is more used in Chinese 
  cuisine as a coloring than a flavoring and is often in combination with 
  light soy sauce. It is usually higher in soybeans and lower in wheat 
  than light soy   sauce, is thicker in consistency and almost invariably 
  contains some sugar or molasses, but the sweetener should be at the 
  bottom of the ingredient list. Pearl River Bridge is the brand I 
  usually use.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Dark Sweet Soy Sauce</h3> is similar to dark soy sauce except 
  that molasses has been moved up above both soybeans and wheat. You 
  don't need to stock this because you can just mix some dark soy sauce 
  with molasses.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Mushroom Flavored Dark Soy Sauce</h3> is dark soy sauce with 
  "natural flavors and flavor enhancers". It may or may not be sweetened. 
  I never find it very mushroomy so I'd rather use regular dark soy sauce 
  and add some mushroom soaking liquid to the recipe.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Thick Soy Sauce</h3> is dark soy sauce that has been thickened 
  with starch. It is used mainly for dipping.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Japanese</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Japan is the land of many regional variations and quality grades of 
just about everything, and soy sauce is no exception - but most aren't 
common in North America. Soy Sauce is so important in Japan that Japan 
has been called "a country with only one sauce".</p>
<ul>
<li><h3><i>Koikuchi</i></h3> is the type familiar to us as "Japanese soy 
  sauce" and accounts for over 80% of production in Japan. It is made 
  from roughly equal amounts of soybeans and wheat.
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Tamari</i></h3> is still made by the traditional method as a 
  byproduct of miso production in limited quantity. Most products labeled 
  "tamari" are now made similar to other soy sauces and most contain some 
  wheat.<p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Shiro</i></h3> (white) is made mostly of wheat with very 
  little soybeans. It is sweeter than koikuchi and often used where the 
  light color is important to presentation appearance.<p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Usukuchi</i></h3> is made with the addition of sweet liquid 
  from fermented rice and is both saltier and lighter in color than 
  koikuchi.<p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Saishikomi</i></h3> (twice brewed) uses koikuchi instead of 
  brine in the fermentation process so is considerably stronger and 
  darker.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Korean</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Soy sauce is as important in Korea as it is in Japan. Korea has two 
main types, and a few minor ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3><i>Gan-Jang:</i></h3> &nbsp; [Regular Soy Sauce] &nbsp; This 
  type was adopted from Japan around 1886 and has become the soy sauce 
  used for most Korean cuisine. It is also called <i>Whe-Gan-Jang</i> 
  (Japanese <i>Gan-Jang</i>).<p></p></li>

<li><h3><i>Guk-Gan-Jang:</i></h3> &nbsp; [Soy Sauce for Soup] &nbsp; 
  This is the original Korean soy sauce, made for over 1000 years as 
  a byproduct of making <i>Dwenjang</i>, the Korean equivalent of 
  Japanese Miso. It is quite a bit saltier, has a simpler, less sweet 
  flavor, and a lighter color than regular soy sauce. It was originally 
  made from soy only, but today most includes some wheat, as most 
  <i>Dwenjang</i> now does. It is favored for soups to keep them a 
  lighter color, but is also often used for Korean vegetable dishes 
  (<i>Namul</i>) and Korean salads (<i>Muchim</i>). My local Korean 
  markets here in Los Angeles carry Sempio brand in two varieties, faked 
  up (yellow cap, 2015 US $4.49) and Naturally Brewed (black cap, 2015 
  US $6.69). The color is abut the same, but the naturally brewed has 
  noticeably better flavor. &nbsp; <b>Subst:</b> Korean cooking maven 
  Maangchi suggests using Thai Fish Sauce to keep colors light if you 
  don't have Soy Sauce for Soup (yes, they do use fish sauce in Korea).
  <p></p></li>

<li><h3><i>Mat-Gan-Jang:</i></h3> &nbsp; Various flavored soy sauces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taiwan</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Taiwan, despite it's Chinese population, has gone pretty much over to 
the Japanese style soy sauce.</p>

<h2>Vietnam</h2>
<p></p>

<p>In Vietnam, Fish Sauce takes the place of Soy Sauce in most recipes, 
but Soy Sauce is used, particularly by Buddhist monks. The Vietnamese 
prefer a soy sauce similar to the Chinese Light, considerably lighter 
than Japanese soy sauce. The Korean "Soy Sauce for Soup" could be used 
as a substitute.</p>

<h2>Philippines</h2>
<p></p>

Filipino <h3><i>Toyo</i></h3> is quite similar to Japanese soy sauce, 
which can be used as a substitute.<p></p>

<h2>Indonesian</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3><i>Kecap Asin</i></h3> is similar to Chinese light soy sauce which 
  can be used as a substitute. Kecap asin is not widely available in the 
  US.<p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Kecap Manis</i></h3> has palm sugar as the top ingredient and 
  is thick and very sweet. It is widely available in the US, particularly 
  Heinz' ABC brand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Malaysia &amp; Singapore</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3><i>Kicap Cair</i></h3> is similar to Indonesian Kecap Asin or 
  Chinese light soy sauce.<p></p></li>
<li><h3><i>Kicap Lemak</i></h3> is similar to Indonesian Kecap Manis but 
  with a whole lot less sugar. Maybe cut Kecap Manis half and half with 
  Chinese dark soy sauce as a substitute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Soy Sauce is high in salt. Low Sodium (Reduced Salt) Soy Sauce (salt 
is removed after manufacture) is still pretty high in salt, so useless 
to those trying to reduce blood pressure. Medical sources say reducing 
sodium has little effect until nearly all salt is eliminated from the 
diet. In my non-medical opinion this sounds like treating the symptoms, 
not the disease, by creating an imbalance so extreme it happens to 
counter symptoms of the real problem. As usual I point to demographics. 
Japan, a very high salt culture, has traditionally had 1/3 to 1/5 the 
heart disease rate in North America, but this is slowly changing as 
the Japanese adopt a more Western diet and sedentary lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because naturally brewed Soy Sauce is a long fermented product, it 
is free from the toxins and hormone-like substances some soy products 
have been suspected of, and is generally considered safe. Artificial 
soy sauces and "liquid aminos" however, made from soy protein and 
hydrochloric acid, are chemical swills often containing known toxins 
and carcinogens.</p>
