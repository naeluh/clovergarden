<h1>Tempeh</h1>

[Tempe (Java)]
<p>
This traditional Indonesian product is made from soft cooked soybeans 
infected with a colony of <i>Rhizopus oligosporus</i> mold to make the 
most meat-like of fermented soy products. Does it taste like meat? No - 
it has its own flavor and texture, but it's close enough to the ballpark 
to stand in for chicken and pork where those are too costly. Of course here 
in North America tempeh costs more than chicken or pork, but is favored by 
strict vegetarians.</p>
<p>Back in the '70s when William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi wrote 
<i>The Book of Tempeh</i>, tempeh was the "great white hope" of vegans -  
finally a vegetable source of vitamin B12. That hope evaporated when 
tempeh started being made to Western handling and processing standards. 
The vitamin B12 had come from bacterial and insect contamination, just 
as it had with  Spiralina before it (<a href="bp_soytz.html#t01">T1</a>). There simply 
is no natural vegetarian source sufficient to supply this absolutely 
essential vitamin.</p>
<p>In those idealistic times, the socially concious were reading 
Francis Moore Lapp&eacute;'s <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> and expected 
vegetarianism to take over the world. Surtleff and Aoyagi anticipated 
tempeh shops springing up in every community. Well, there are probably 
some aging hippies up San Francisco way, or in Oregon, running tempeh 
shops, and we have at least one guy down here in Los Angeles making some 
as a side line. Of course, as primary port of entry for the Pacific Rim, 
we are well stocked with frozen tempeh from Asia. The photo specimen was 
3/4 inch thick and about 5 inches by 5-1/2 inches weighing 11 ounces.</p> 
<p>I bought (and read) <i>The Book of Tempeh</i> when it came out in 1979 
(and still have my disintegrating copy), but even in my bead wearing 
vegetarian days I was not a very good hippie. I confess that I had not 
tasted tempeh until 2010 when I wanted to clear some photo samples out of 
my freezer compartment.</p>
<p>Tempeh is a nice change of texture for hard core vegetarians, but 
is not so satisfying for omnivours. Compared to chicken it is much firmer 
and the texture is pebbly rather than stringy. Flavor is nutty rather 
than savory and it's a bit dry rather than succulent. It is, however, 
reasonably palatable.<p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You can find cakes of tempeh in the 
freezer cases of well stocked Asian markets, particularly those serving 
a Southeast Asian community.  It is also now used in Korea and by 
followers of Michio Kushi macrobotics.
<p>You may find fresh tempeh in natural food stores, and may be able to 
find a local producer. Here in Los Angeles Dave's Gourmet Korean sells it 
at a number of local certified farmers markets (yes, you have to go to 
one to get it, no Web site, no orders, no store (Aug 2009)).</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Frozen tempeh can be kept frozen for a year. 
Unopened packages bought fresh will keep refrigerated for about 3 weeks 
from date of packaging. Once opened tempeh should be kept in a tightly 
sealed bag or container and will be good refrigerated for 5 to 7 days. 
A small amount of darker mold on the surface is not a problem so long as 
the tempeh is still firm and smells fresh. Cooked tempeh should be 
refrigerated and consumed within 5 days.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Tempeh is most often cut into cubes, sticks or 
slices and fried in oil to prepare it for use in recipes. Easiest 
and least oil is to deep fry in a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">
<b>Kadhai</b></a> or wok. Fry until lightly browned and crispy on the 
outside - it frys fairly quickly with very little splattering. If there 
will be no subsequent cooking you will want to cut your tempeh into 
fairly thin slices. Otherwise, follow the directions for your recipe.
<p>Tempeh can also be grilled or broiled, or crumbled and cooked similar 
to ground meat. It is also sometimes boiled or steamed, and very fresh 
tempeh can be eaten raw.</p>

<p><b>Making Tempeh:</b> &nbsp; Tempeh is not difficult to make, but does 
require building a primitive incubator so the temperature is tightly 
controlled. The main hassle is dehulling the soybeans. Dry process 
requires a very loosly adjusted grain grinder, wet process just needs 
pans. You can easily find instructions and sources for the mold culture 
on the Internet.<p></p>


<h2>Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>

<p>Tempeh is about 20% protein, which is of a fairly high quality in 
keeping with other soy products. It has about 50 calories per ounce and, 
unlike many fermented soy products, it is low in salt. It has good 
amounts of Calcium, Iron and Zinc.</p>

<p>Because tempeh is a thoroughly fermented product, it is low in the  
toxins and hormone-like substances some non-fermented soy products are 
suspected of, and is generally considered safe in any reasonable 
quantity. Because it includes the complete bean (less husk) it is more 
nutritious than tofu.</p>
