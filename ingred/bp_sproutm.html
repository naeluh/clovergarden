<h1>Sprouting Bean, Peas, &amp; Lentils Sprouts</h1>

<p><img src="../ke/img/ke_sprtjar05f.jpg" alt="Sprouting Jar with 
Moth Beans" class=mrg>
A <a href="../ke/ke_sproutjz.html"><b>Sprouting Jar</b></a> with 
screen lid like the one in the photo is all you need to successfully 
sprout beans, peas, lentils.  Sprouting caps are easy to find on the 
Internet, and are just about all sized to fit a wide mouth Mason 
canning jar. </p>

<p>Of course, there are more complex sprouters available  but this 
is fine, especially when sprouting for Indian recipes. If you want 
to sprout grassy things you mow for your salad, that's another 
matter entirely.</p>

<p>Don't expect to produce sprouts with straight plump stems like the 
commercial ones in the photo at top of page - this takes special 
equipment and techniques. Sproutable Mung Beans are very widely available 
in North America, but soybeans for sprouting are usually special small 
varieties. These can be found on-line, and possibly in Korean markets.
The sprouts in the photo are Moth Beans (Matki), very popular in India.
</p>

<p>Always take care with sanitation, as sprouts can host E.coli and 
Salmonella. This is usually a problem with commercial sprouts, which 
will spend a fair amount of time between sprouter and salad.
</p>

<h3>Warning:</h3> &nbsp; Do not sprout Red Kidney Beans. They are toxic 
and need to be pre-soaked and cooked at a boil for at least 10 minutes. 
The FDA recommends 30 minutes just to make sure. Also, never cook them 
in a slow cooker, that low a temperature can increase the toxicity up 
to 5 times.

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select Beans that are very fresh, from a source with high turnover. 
  Old beans will not sprout well, or at all. Some vendors sell beans 
  specifically for sprouting.</li>
<li>Wash the equipment to be used.</li>
<li>Select a quantity of beans that will not overload the sprouter - 
  they need good air circulation. About 1/2 to 2/3 cup is good for a jar 
  sprouter like the one in the photo. The sprouts in the photo started 
  as 1/2 cup dry and yielded more than 2-1/2 cups sprouted.</li>
<li>Rinse the beans well, then soak them in cool water for 8 to 12 hours, 
  just as if you were going to cook them (except no salt). Very small 
  beans like the Moth Beans in the photo take only 6 hours.</li>
<li>Drain the beans well and rinse with cool water.</li>
<li>Put them in the sprouter, if that isn't where they already are.</li>
<li>Place the sprouter in a location at about 70&deg;F/21&deg;C, away 
  from direct sunlight. Unlike sprouting grassy things, light isn't 
  important for most legumes. The jar should be at an angle, either on 
  a rack as in the photo, or in a bowl.</li>
<li>Rinse with cool water twice per day in cool weather, morning, 
  noon, and night in hot weather. This will keep the beans properly 
  moist and prevent mold and other unwanted organisms from getting 
  established. Always drain so there is no free water in the sprouter. 
  Some jar sprouters have a stand that tilts them towards the screen, 
  but I just leave the jar in a bowl as shown. For other type of 
  sprouters, follow their instructions.</li>
<li>When the sprouts have reached the desired degree of sprouting, rinse 
  them. You can separate out loose skins by swishing them around in a 
  pan of cool water, the skins tend to float for easy removal.</li>
<li>Make sure the sprouts are well drained. Bag them and store in the 
  refrigerator for no more than a couple of days.</li>
  </ol>
