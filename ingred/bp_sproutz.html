<h1>Bean Sprouts</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_sproutsm02f.jpg" alt="Soy and Mung Bean Sprouts" class=mrg>
[Mung Bean: &nbsp; Thua Ngok (Thai); Tauge (Chinese Hokkien); 
  Tao Nge (Thai Hokkien); Tua Ngok (Laos); Sukjunamul (Korea)]
  <br>[Soy Bean: &nbsp; Kongnamul (Korea)]
<p>
Various kinds of beans are sprouted before being served or cooked in 
recipes. Sprouted beans cook quickly and are more nutritious than the 
dried seeds. One study of sprouted soybeans showed Vitamin B levels 
stayed the same, while Vitamin A increased 300% and Vitamin C increased 
between 500% and 600%. There was also a wider range of amino acids. 
Soybean sprouts have also proven effective in regulating blood sugar 
levels. What beans are sprouted and to what extent they are sprouted 
varies from region to region.</p>

<p>As with all legumes, bean sprouts do contain some anti-nutrients, 
so consumption of raw bean sprouts should be moderate. Phytic acid, 
a primary anti-nutrient which blocks mineral absorbtion, is reduced 
by the many rinsings the beans go through during sprouting, but there 
is still a fair amount remaining, particularly in soybean sprouts. 
Anti-nutrients are further reduced by cooking.

<p>Sprouting beans at home is very easy, but do not expect to produce 
the straight plump stems of the sprouts shown to the left. This takes 
special equipment to accomplish, including keeping the sprouting beans 
under weights. For home use, see our

<h2>East Asia <small>&amp;</small> Southeast Asia</h2>

<p><p><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/kgv_beansprt2h.jpg" alt="Soybean Salad" class=mrg>
In this region, long sprouts of Mung Beans (<i>Vigna radiata</i>) 
predominate, with sprouts of Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) used to a much 
lesser extent, except in Korea. These sprouts are shown in the photo 
above, with Soy Sprouts at the top and Mung Bean Sprouts below. Soybean 
sprouts sold in North America are usually around 3 inches, not including 
the root, but are grown as long as 11 inches in Korea. Mung bean sprouts 
are very well known in North America, but Soybean sprouts are mostly 
available from Korean markets.</p>
<p>While Soybean sprouts are the most used kind in Korea, they are used 
to a much lesser extent in China, and are hardly used at all in Japan. 
I attribute this to the relative robustness of Korean recipes, where a 
durable sprout with a more robust flavor is appropriate. They are also 
used in Southeast Asia, to about the same extent as in China.</p>
<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Fresh Mung Bean sprouts are available in markets 
everywhere in North America. Soybean Sprouts are available in Korean 
markets. Sprouts should be crisp, with no sign of softening or decay.</p>
<p><b>Storing:</b> &nbsp; Refrigerated in a plastic bag, with no free 
water, Mung Bean Sprouts will last three days or so, Soybean Sprouts 
about 2 days longer.</p>
<p><b>Prep:</b> &nbsp; Bean sprouts should be rinsed. In China and 
Korea, the thread like root end will always be pinched off (it's jobs 
like this children are for), but we Barbarians often skip this tedious 
step. It takes about 45 minutes to pinch the roots off 12 ounces of 
bean sprouts. In Korea, some recipes call for the yellow bean to be 
removed, but for most recipes it is left on. Some Korean markets carry 
bags of Soybean Sprouts with the root ends cut off.</p>
<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Keep it short. For some recipes, as little as 
10 seconds in boiling water for Mung Bean Sprouts, 30 seconds for Soybean 
Sprouts. For soups and stews, the bean sprouts go in in the last minutes 
of cooking. In some Southeast Asian soups, raw mung bean sprouts are 
simply sprinkled on top of the soup at serving.</p>

<br>

<h2>South Asia - India</h2>

<p><img src="img/bp_mungsp11e.jpg" alt="India Mung Sprouts" class=mrg>
In India, both Mung Beans and Soybeans are are sprouted, and many other 
beans as well, but much differently than in East and Southeast Asia. The 
photo to the left shows a close up of mung beans sprouted properly for 
Indian recipes. Most of the nutritional advantages of sprouted beans are 
already realized when the tails are just 1/2 inch or so long. You will 
not be able to find sprouts like these in markets in North America, and 
will have to sprout your own.</p>
<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Sprouts in this form can stand more cooking 
than than the East Asian style sprouts. Most beans should be cooked to 
reduce the natural toxins they contain. Generally, beans that didn't 
sprout are cooked right along with the sprouted ones. Some beans, 
like Black Beans, have a low germination rate (as little as 50%).

<p><img src="img/bp_valkodav04e.jpg" alt="Kodava Val Sprouts" class=mrg>
In India, many different beans are used sprouted. The beans shown in the 
photo to the left are Kodava Val, a rather small variety of Lablab 
beans from southern India. This one has a very tough skin, so is usually 
sprouted, then the skin is removed. That's a rather tedious job (again, 
this is the sort of job children are for), but the flavor of the beans 
is very good.
