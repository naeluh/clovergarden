<h1>Tamarind</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_tamar12d.jpg" alt="Tamarind forms" class=mrg>
  [Indian Date; Tamarindo 
  (spanish); Asam (malay), Asem Jawa (Indonesia);  Imli, Amli, Chinch 
  (India);  Ma-kahm (Thai); Me (Viet); Puli (Tamil, Malay); 
  <i>Tamarindus indica</i>]
<p>
Native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the tamarind tree was known 
to the ancient Egyptians, and taken to India so long ago even botanists 
thought it was native there. From India it was introduced to Persia and the 
Arab world, thus Arabic "tamar hindi" (Indian date). It is now planted 
throughout the tropics and sub-tropics including Mexico, Central America, 
the Caribbean and southern Florida.</p> 
<p>This hardwood tree can grow to around 70 feet but is in fact a legume, 
related to the common green bean and pea. The sweet/sour fruit pulp 
surrounding the seeds within the thin brittle shell are the part most used, 
but leaf shoots and flowers are also used. Tamarind fruit pulp is an 
important flavoring for food and beverages worldwide.and is an important 
ingredient in Worcestershire sauce, HP Sauce (UK and Canada) and Jamaican 
Pickapeppa sauce.

<br class=cll></p><hr class="hr2">


<p>Tamarind pulp is widely sold in several forms, as illustrated in the photo 
above:
<ul>
<li><b>Whole Pods:</b>  &nbsp; These are found piled in bins (mostly broken) in 
markets serving Hispanic communities, and carefully packed in windowed 
gift boxes for sale in Asian communities. This is the least convenient 
form as you must pick off the fragile shell before using. Otherwise 
prepare the same as for the block form but use a bit more to compensate 
for the seeds.</li>
<li><b>Pressed Block:</b> &nbsp; This is the most common form - pulp with 
the shell and most of the seeds removed. Thailand is the most common 
exporter but also India and other tropical countries.</li>
<li><b>Concentrate (Regular Paste):</b> &nbsp; Widely available and the 
most convenient form - you need only spoon it out of a jar. A tablespoon 
of this paste is roughly equivalent to 1-1/2 tablespoon of block after 
it is soaked and straining as described below. Thailand exports a number 
of brands, often labeled in incomprehensible Thai script and in Vietnamese 
as <i>Nu&ouml;c Me Chua</i>. They vary in quality (some have tiny bits 
of shell in them but this doesn't seem to bother most recipes). Some 
brands are "Product of U.S.A.", but read the label - some contain 
an uncertain amount of "High Fructose Corn Syrup".</li>
<li><b>Concentrate (Black):</b> &nbsp; This seems to comes only from 
India. The most common brand in the US is Tamicon, but there are others. 
It is highly concentrated and clearly has been cooked down, giving it a 
bit of a molasses flavor. You'd need to dilute it with 2 parts water to 
1 part concentrate to get it about where the regular paste is, but the 
flavor will still be different.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class=tf><b>Measures</b></span> &nbsp; Most Indian recipes call 
for pulp from blocks. Measures are usually by volume, sometimes 
tablespoons, but more often "the size of a golf ball", "the size of 
a lime" or "the size of a Gooseberry. <b>Caution:</b> limes in India 
(and most of the world) are what we call "Key Limes" here in North 
America. They are much smaller than our common Persian / Tahitian 
limes, and Indian Gooseberries are much larger than what we call a 
gooseberry in North America.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lime:</b> &nbsp; Key Lime size, about 1.4 inches diameter,  
  1-1/8 ounce (32 grams) and fill 1-1/2 Tablespoons (International  
  tablespoons, not Australian).<p></p></li>
<li><b>Lemon:</b> &nbsp; Lemons like our big yellow ones are not native 
  to India, where the words "lemon" and "lime" are used interchangeably. 
  What botanical lemons they do have are mostly small and green. I have 
  not been able to find an exact size, but lets go with around 1-1/2 
  inches, 1-1/3 ounces (38 grams) and 2 Tablespoons.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Gooseberry:</b> &nbsp; Indian gooseberries get up to about 
  2 inches diameter, but average about 1-5/8 inches diameter, which 
  would be 1-3/4 ounces (50gms), which would be just over 2-3/4 
  Tablespoons. <p></p></li>
<li><b>Golf Ball:</b> &nbsp; This size would be 1.7 inches diameter,  
  weigh 2 ounces (57 grams) and fill 3 Tablespoons. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Block Form</h3>

<p>Is block better than concentrate? Yes, noticeably more tart and 
flavorful, nearly identical to fresh pods but easier to use because 
you don't have to pick off the shell and deal with the seeds. The result 
is much thinner than concentrate, but remarkably strong.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lime size:</b> &nbsp; Take 1 ounce (30 grams, 1-1/2 Tablespoon), 
  chop coarsely and place in a 1 cup measuring cup. Fill with almost 
  boiling water to 2/3 cup. Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring 
  occasionally. It is ready when all the sticky black paste is dissolved 
  leaving the white seed surround and fibers. <b>Golf Ball size:</b> 
  &nbsp; Take 1-7/8 ounces (55 grams 2-7/8 Tablespoons) and do as above 
  but fill to a full 1 cup.</li> 
<li>Strain, preferably through a nylon strainer due to the acidity, 
  pushing the pulp around and pressing with a wooden spoon. Be sure to 
  scrape the outside of the strainer as much paste will adhere there.
  </li>
<li>Lime size will yield about 1/2 cup - the equivalent to about 5 
  tablespoons of regular concentrate.  Golf ball size will yield 
  about 3/4 cup, equivalent to about 7-1/2 tablespoons of concentrate.
  </li> 
<li>Refrigerate what you don't use right away - it'll keep a week or 
  so.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Young Pods:</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sampalok  (Philippine)]
<br><img src="img/bp_tamagn02e.jpg" alt="Green Tamarind Pods, whole and peeled" class=mrg>
<p>
Immature pods are used in India to flavor rice. In the Bahamas green 
pods are roasted in ashes until they burst, then are dipped in the ashes 
and eaten. Immature pods are not much available in North America because 
the trees are unlikely to fruit here except at the southern tip of 
Florida. Mexico grows plenty, but does not ship immature ones north 
of the border.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased frozen from a Philippine market 
in Los Angeles, labeled Green Tamarind Fruit. These were fairly mature, 
the shells already nearly brittle, but the flesh was green and seeds 
quite soft. The flesh was quite tart, with a sweet-tart balance similar 
to lemon. The seeds could be easily chewed, but you don't want to do 
that. They were very bitter and astringent. The best way to peel these is 
right out of the freezer compartment. Leave them in a bowl of hot water 
for about 1 minute so the shell is softened but the flesh is still firmly 
frozen. Thawed, the flesh can be eaten after pulling the fibers out 
by the stem, or it can be squeezed for juice.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/bp_tamlf02h.jpg" alt="Stems of Leaves" class=mrg>
In India and Africa, tender leaf shoots are used as greens and in 
soup. They can be purchased in jars packed in brine in some markets 
serving Asian communities. These have a very light sweet-sour taste. 
The hard stems must be removed, which is a hassle because they are in 
little pieces, and the leaves don't strip off easily - not really 
worthwhile in my opinion. If I lived in a growing region where I could 
get them fresh, I might think differently. The stems in the photo carried 
very thin leaves 0.3 inches wide and 0.7 inch long. Tamarind leaf, water, 
salt, citric acid, sodium benzoate (preservative) sodium metabisulfate 
(color preservative).
<br class=cll>


<h2>Seeds</h2>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [kachika (Gujarat); Imli Beej (Hindi)]
<br><img src="img/bp_tamasd02h.jpg" alt="Tamarind Seeds and Seed Kernels" class=mrg>
<p>
In the growing regions Tamarind seeds are roasted and eaten as a snack, 
as well as being ground to flour for use as a thickener. Despite being 
very nutritious with plenty of antioxidants and such, they currently have 
little use outside the growing regions. A process is being developed 
to use them to produce a substance similar to, but said to be superior to, 
fruit pectin for making jams and jellies.</p>

<p>As harvested from the dried pods sold here in North America, the 
seeds are extremely hard and can withstand even a sharp hit with a 
tack hammer. After roasting on a cast iron comal at 500&deg;F/260&deg;C 
the outer shells are brittle enough to crack with a tack hammer and 
pry off. The kernels are still very hard. In the growing regions, 
children eat the roasted seeds like very hard candy, working on them 
for a while. They can eat fresh seeds from ripening pods more easily
but those need to be roasted too as they are bitter and astringent 
raw. Roasted, the flavor is similar but not identical to roasted 
peanuts. I have seen them listed in an "alternate" recipe for Nigerian 
Banga Soup Spice (a recipe calling for ingredients you can actually get).

<h2>Flowers:</h2>
<br><img src="img/bp_tamaflr01k.jpg" alt="Tamarind Floweres" class=mrg>
In India, flowers are used in salads and are made into a pickle in 
southwest India.

<h2>Non Culinary Uses</h2>
<br><img src="img/tamarind03.jpg" alt="Tamarind Stained Bowl" class=mrg>
In Indonesia, tamarind pulp is rubbed into pottery before firing to 
produce a unique mottled reddish brown glaze.
