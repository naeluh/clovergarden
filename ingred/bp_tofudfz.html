<p>
This is pretty much a Japan-only specialty. Some time between 1550 and 
1650 Two traditional methods were developed, taking advantage of bitter 
winter cold, but today this product is made in large industrial 
facilities. First Soft Tofu is frozen, slowly to assure formation of 
large crystals. It is than thawed and the water is wrung out, followed 
by conventional drying. This process differs substantially from the 
Vacuum Freeze Drying method used industrially for other products, thus 
Dried-Frozen Tofu.</p> 
<p>Formerly, much of it was treated with ammonia gas so it puffed up 
better when soaked, but this has been almost totally replaced by a mix 
of sodium and potassium salts called kansui. This produces a slightly 
higher rise and avoids an ammonia odor in the product, though that 
odor would be removed by the soaking step.</p>

<h3>Cooking</h3> &nbsp; The dried tofu must first be soaked in warm 
water for at least 10 minutes. After soaking it needs to be wrung 
out, like squeezing a wet sponge. Now it has the taste and texture 
of a stiff kitchen sponge. It than needs to be simmered, either in 
a recipe or in preparation for a recipe, for at least 20 minutes.
<p></p>

<p> Fully cooked, this Tofu has a unique texture, tender, but a bit 
chewy with a somewhat meaty mouth feel. Its natural flavor is very 
light, and it tastes sort of like tofu. It is generally expected that 
it will absorb flavors from other ingredients it is cooked with.  
If it has been simmered in plain water, as to prepare it for a stir 
fry, wring it out again so it can absorb flavors.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  This product is available on the Internet, 
and probably from sources catering to the Michio Kushi Macrobiotic 
community. The photo specimens are Eden brand, made in Japan. The 
package contained 6 squares, weighing a total of 56 grams (about 2 
ounces). Cost was 2019 US $13.56 (with free shipping), or about $108 
per pound. <u>After</u> soaking and simmering this would come to 
about US $41.00 per pound for edible tofu (with water wrung out). 
This brand includes only soybeans and nigari (magnesium chloride - 
a coagulating agent). If it was made with kansui, it would puff up 
a bit more, but the weight of solids would be unchanged.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In a sealed package stored away from heat 
and sunlight, this product should last 6 to 8 months.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A dried square 0.25 inch thick became 0.31 
thick after soaking and simmering. 2 ounces will become about 6.1 
ounces after soaking and simmering (this is weight with water 
wrung out).<p></p>
