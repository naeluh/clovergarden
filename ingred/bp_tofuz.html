<h1>Tofu / Bean Curd</h1>

<p>[Tofu (Japan, US); Dofu, Doufou (China); Tubu (Korea); Toad Food 
(improper), Bean Crud (improper)]</p>

<p>Basically, bean curd is cottage cheese made by coagulating ground 
up strained and cooked soybeans (soy milk) rather than dairy milk. First 
appearing during the Chou Dynasty (1132-246 BCE), there are several theories 
for its origin, all of which are unadulterated speculation.</p>

<p>The photo specimens are, from left to right, silken, soft and firm 
tofu, all by the same manufacturer in Los Angeles.</p> 

<p>If you want to know how to make all forms of tofu and every detail about 
it, I recommend <i>The Book of Tofu</i> by William Shurtleff &amp; Akiko

<p>In the US tofu has become a focus for laughter due to vegetarians 
over-using it and trying to build turkeys out of it for Thanksgiving 
dinner - as well as tofu sausages, hot dogs, hamburgers and jerky. Now 
I'm not anti-vegetarian, and was a vegetarian for almost the regulation 
9 years (though never an "ethical" vegetarian), but I think building 
vegetarian imitations of dead animal parts is a little funny, despite 
it's long history in Asia. I use various forms of bean curd fairly 
regularly, but just can't resist calling it "bean crud".</p>

<p>In most of Asia tofu is used in moderation as a flavor absorbing and 
textural ingredient in many interesting dishes, but only occasionally as 
a main ingredient and then usually as an appetizer or desert. Consumption 
is heavier in parts of southern China, but rice is still the main 
staple and tofu an accessory. This is as it should be, as there are still 
open questions regarding health impacts from heavy tofu consumption - see 
<a href="bp_soyhz.html">Soybeans and Health</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="reg"><u>Regular Tofu</u></h2>

<p>Because of the many uses to which tofu is put, there are a number of 
ways to make it resulting in different textures. This may be controlled 
by choice of coagulant, by draining and/or pressing.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Silken Tofu:</h3>
  <br>[Kinugoshi (Japan)] &nbsp; &nbsp; This form is made from relatively 
  thick soy milk and precipitated in tight containers so the whey does not 
  drain but is incorporated into the tofu. Once set the block is loosened 
  from the mold into water where it is cut into blocks of the desired size. 
  The finished tofu is soft and with a totally smooth texture with no 
  porousness at all. This is a luxurious tofu but it must be noted that 
  since the whey is not pressed out it includes more of the hormones, 
  mineral blockers, and toxins soybeans are accused of - so perhaps it 
  should be eaten on occasion rather than every day.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Soft Tofu:</h3>
  <br>[Momendofu (cotton tofu) (Japan); Tubu Mou (Korea); Lao doufu (China)] 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the most standard form of tofu in the US and Korea - 
  kind of an all purpose tofu. In Japan a fair amount of silken tofu is used 
  but "cotton" still dominates. In Asia this may be called "firm tofu" but 
  here it's always "regular" or "soft", with firm reserved for what in Asia 
  is called "dry".
  <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Firm Tofu:</h3>
  <br>[Dry Tofu; Dou gan (China)] &nbsp; &nbsp; This form is 
  common in Chinese cooking and not much known in Japan, but a few Korean 
  recipes also call for this form. It holds up better in stir fried and 
  stewed dishes than soft tofu. Though the Chinese name means "dry tofu" 
  it is packed in water just like all the rest. In the US it always 
  carries the "firm" designation. <p></p></li>
<li><h3>Extra Firm Tofu:</h3>
  <br>This form is finally becoming 
  reasonably common (2018). It is ideal for deep frying, stir frying and 
  other applications that need a firm, durable tofu. It saves a lot of 
  time pressing Firm Tofu to remove water. I usually find it in Korean 
  markets.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Extra Soft Tofu:</h3>
  <br><img src="img/bp_tofuxs02c.jpg" alt="Tubes of Extra Soft Tofu" class=mrg>
  [Sui-dofu (China); Sundubu, Soon Tofu (Korea)] &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Similar to Silken Tofu but more so - this form is so soft it must be 
  eaten with a spoon rather than with chopsticks. It's often so soft that 
  in China it's ladled out into bowls brought to the tofu shop by 
  customers.  It's a common item in the Korean markets around here packed 
  in tubs or plastic sausage tubes - often labeled "Tofu Extra Mou" (isn't 
  there a Korean word for "Extra"?). This form is often used with syrups 
  and toppings as a desert.  As with Silken Tofu, moderation may be 
  appropriate. 
  <br class=cll><p></p></li>
<li>  <h3>Flower Tofu</h3><a href="../recipes/cap_tofuf1.html">
  <br><img src="img/cap_tofuf1c.jpg" alt="Bowl of Flower Tofu" class=mrg></a>
  [Huoshui Douhua] &nbsp; &nbsp;  This one is very popular in Sichuan, served 
  with various dips (with various amounts of Chilis in them). You won't find 
  it in stores, but you can make it yourself at home. See our recipe 
  <a href="../recipes/cap_tofuf1.html"><b>Flower Tofu</b></a>.
  <br class=cll><p></p></li>
<li><h3>Egg Tofu:</h3>
  <br>This is a savory variety made in Japan by adding raw egg to the soy milk 
  before adding the coagulant. Not all labeled "egg tofu" is actually tofu 
  though - some is just egg custard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing</h2>
<br><img src="img/bp_tofutub01k.jpg" alt="Tub of Tofu" class=mrg>
Vast quantities of tofu are manufactured here in Los Angeles and put up 
in sealed plastic tubs. Common sizes are 10oz, 13oz, 16oz, 18oz and 19oz. 
I have cookbooks that imply a block is as small as 8oz. The Book of Tofu 
says 12oz. Recipes invariably call for "one block of tofu". OK lady, 
what size is a block of tofu in your neighborhood? You'd think scales 
hadn't been invented yet.<p></p>

<p>When I first bought tubs of tofu many years ago it needed to be used 
in just a few days or it would go sour. Sterile packaging has been 
improved to the point some brands don't expire for 3 months and probably 
last longer.</p>
<p>Tofu tubs should be kept refrigerated at all times. Once opened tofu 
should be used up in just a couple of days. It is recommended that opened  
tofu be kept refrigerated submerged in clean water that's changed every 
day. If tofu smells or tastes at all sour it has turned and should be 
discarded. If it's very faintly sour it may be refreshed by cutting into 
large cubes and par boiling them in lightly salted water for about 3 
minutes.</p>
<p>Some of the tofu made here in Los Angeles, particularly for the 
Vietnamese community, is not cut into cubes nor packaged in tubs. It is 
shaped kind of like a large dinner roll and wrapped in plastic wrap. 
This tofu must be delivered fresh daily and used the same day. It would 
still be good for deep frying the next morning if properly refrigerated.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Draining <small>&amp;</small> Pressing:</h2>
<br><img src="img/bp_tofupress06c.jpg" alt="Tofu Being Pressed" class=mrg>
Tofu is just about always drained before use and may be pressed to firm 
it up and remove water - particularly if it is to be fried. A convenient 
way to drain it is to punch some small holes in the bottom of the tub and 
an air hole through the film at the top. Set the tub in a tray with a 
spacer under it and refrigerate. Empty water from the tray as needed.
<p>A convenient way to press a small amount of tofu is to prepare the tray 
as for draining except remove the top film entirely. Set a full tub of 
tofu n top (or an empty tub filled with something heavy). Refrigerate - 
the longer it sits the firmer it gets. For larger amounts, and for deep 
frying which wants a hard pressing, a rig like that pictured is needed. 
Set a board on a shallow slant, cover it with a dish towel, slice the tofu to size and 
arrange the slices on the board. Cover with another board and put several 
pounds of weights on top of it. Retired cutting boards are excellent for 
this purpose. Press a few hours for deep fried tofu, less for other uses.</p>
<p>Silken Tofu is never pressed - that would destroy its texture.</p>
<br>

   <br><a href="../recipes/jmv_age1.html">
   <img src="img/bp_tofuage17h.jpg" alt="Deep Fried Tofu Shapes" class=mrg></a>
   This form is easy to make for anyone with some oil and something to 
   heat it in. The tofu must be cut to size as desired, then pressed 
   well to remove most of the water. Generally this is done by spreading 
   a towel over a slanted board, arranging the tofu over it and covering 
   it with another board with heavy weights on it.
   <p>The outside is crisp and light brown while the inside is white and 
   spongy. You can eat them as-is, but they are commonly subjected to 
   further cooking of some sort. While generally put to other uses, these 
   ag&eacute; can be stuffed, if the puffy kind aren't commercially 
   available and the hassle of making them at home is not practical. You 
   do need to scoop some of the white inside out before stuffing.</p> 
   <p>The photo shows both the traditional triangular form and the 
   rectangular form more common today. The rectangular pieces were 
   3.75 x 2.13 x 0.80 and weighed 2-5/8 ounces. In other words, a 19 
   ounce block has shrunk to less than 8 ounces - but gained considerable 
   calories due to oil. The photo specimens were fried quite long and 
   have a fairly thick crust - shorter frying may be desirable for some 
   applications. &nbsp;

   <h2>Deep Fried Soybean Cake</h2>
   <img src="img/bp_soydf02e.jpg" alt="Deep Fried Tofu Blocks" class=mrg>
   <p>Here in Los Angeles, the many Asian markets carry deep fried 
   tofu of this type in many shapes and sizes, packed on foam trays or 
   in plastic bags. They are soft on the outside, never crispy, and 
   foamy on the inside. They have many uses in stir fries and stews. 
   The photo specimens were cubes about 1-1/2 inches on a side - 
   purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
   2020 US $2.39 for an 8 ounce package.  Ingr: Soy Bean, Soy Bean Oil, 
   Water, Calcium Sulphate.

   [Gan-modoki (Japan)]
   <p>This is the prototype veggie burger - no attempt to make it 
   taste like beef at this point though. Ganmo are made in the form of patties, 
   similar to hamburger patties, or balls, similar to meatballs. They are 
   made of tofu and grated or slivered vegetables, then deep fried in oil 
   (some people simmer them in a dashi stock instead). I prefer patties to 
   balls as the balls remain kind of mushy inside. Commercial products are 
   generally firmer but much heavier than home made.

   <h2 id="pouch">Ag&eacute; Pouches <small>&amp;</small> Puffs</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofuage05e.jpg" alt="Deep Fried Tofu Pouches" class=mrg>
   These are commonly purchased commercially (they are available in 
   markets serving Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese communities) because 
   making them yourself is a hassle. To do it right you have to start with 
   whole dry soybeans because the process is a bit different from regular 
   tofu, then you deep fry in two different temperatures of oil. They can 
   be made from commercial tofu in a single pot of oil with careful 
   temperature control but won't be as light and puffy as when made 
   right. The photo specimen pouches (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t13">13</a>) were 3-3/4 x 
   3-3/4 inches by 3/4 inch thick and weighed about 1/2 ounce each. The 
   puffs (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t14">14</a>) were various sizes up to 1-1/2 inch.

<h2 id="press"><u>Pressed Tofu</u></h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Doufu-kan (China)]
<p>This is a form much used in China, but not Japan and I haven't seen any 
of it in the Korean markets either. The firmest type of tofu is made and 
spread onto cloths. For the thinnest versions a stack of as many as 100 
cloths is made. The stack is subjected to very heavy pressure in a screw 
press or similar device. This comes in many forms and only some of the 
most important are shown here.</p>

   [Stew Bean Curd, Dou Gan]
   <p>
   These blocks of very firm tofu (about as firm as Monterey Jack) are 
   available in plain (right) and "baked" (left). The baked variety is 
   coated with various flavorings. The photo specimens were coated with 
   soy sauce, sesame oil, chili, aniseed and salt The "standard" size is 
   roughly 2.7 x 2.2 inches and 0.6 inch thick, sold in packages of 
   4 squares, weighing 6.7 ounces. Other sizes are also found. The plain 
   photo specimens were 5.1 x 2.7 x 0.7 inches, two to a package 
   weighing 6-1/4 ounces. This form can be sliced and diced and 
   used as an ingredient in stir fries, stews, sauces and even salads. 
   It can stand up to extended cooking. Purchased for 2016 US $2.49 per 
   6.7 ounces.

   <h2>Pressed Tofu Sheet</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofupresd03e.jpg" alt="Pressed Tofu Sheets" class=mrg>
   This is the basic pressed sheet, 12-1/2 x 6 x 0.05 inches with the 
   fabric pattern pressed into both sides. Actual size, of course, varies 
   with manufacturer and intended use. These sheets were made in China 
   and shipped frozen to the US - freezing doesn't seem to bother this 
   stuff at all (not enough water to crystalize). Ingredients: Soybeans, 
   Water, Salt.
   <p>For another brand purchased at the same market (also from China and 
   shipped frozen) the sheets were 18-1/2 x 9 inches and only 0.015 inch 
   thick. Ingredients: Soybean, Water.</p>
   <p>This stuff feels like fabric and stands up very well to handling - 
   and takes about 15 minutes of simmering to be tender.

   <p>Found in Chinese markets but also commonly used in Japan this form is 
   less common than others due to the obvious logistic problems in 
   transport and storage. These sheets are extremely thin and brittle - 
   they'll crumble if you look at them wrong. The photo specimen was 21 
   inches long (unfolded) 7-1/2 inches wide and 0.010 (one 100th) inch 
   thick. With a 5 minute soak it becomes rubbery and slightly elastic, 
   suitable for wrappings and similar uses. Flavor is, as with most tofu 
   products, fairly bland, but it will absorb flavors from other 
   ingredients.

   Sticks are usually broken up and given a long soak before adding to a 
   recipe. Some spots will be too thick to soak soft and must be picked 
   out and discarded.  The photo specimens were 10-1/2 inches long and 
   weighed 3/4 ounce each. Thickness of the leaves was about 0.015 inch.

   These aren't really pouches as they are just a folded flat

   leaves they were rolled from were 0.010 (one 100th) inch thick. 
   Cooking suggestions were, "Pan fried, stir fried with vegetable,

<h2 id="froz">Frozen Tofu</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Thousand Layer Tofu]
<p><img src="img/bp_tofuf01e.jpg" alt="Slices of Frozen Tofu (Thawed)" class=mrg>
This form is often served as an appetizer but can be used wherever 
its porous nature would be good for holding sauces or dips. When tofu is 
frozen the water forms large crystals which leave a lot of holes when they 
melt and drain out. It leaves the tofu fairly firm and with a slightly 
yellow color. The "thousand layer" name comes because the crystals follow 
the texture which in pressed tofu gives a layered look where there are 
actually no layers.</p>
<p>This form is generally made at home from regular soft tofu. The 
relatively slow freezing in a home freezing compartment encourages 
large ice crystals thus desirably large holes. It is thawed and drained 
(and sometimes squeezed) before using.

winter cold, but today this product is made in large industrial 
facilities. First Frozen Tofu is made (se above), then the water is 
wrung out and the Tofu is dried. This differs from the Vacuum Freze 
Drying process, thus is correctly called Dried-Frozen Tofu. This tofu 
is extremely light weight and will last for 6 to 8 months in a sealed 
package kept in a cool environment away from sunlight. Absurdly expensive.

This is a form of very moldy fermented tofu, often of slightly purplish 
color, popular in China, particularly Sichuan and Hunan but also in Hong

months in a brine made from salt, fermented milk, vegetables and meat, 
which may also include shrimp, amaranth greens, mustard greens, bamboo 
shoots and herbs.</p>

<p>The stench, which even enthusiasts admit smells like rotting garbage, 
is noticeable for blocks around stalls and restaurants where it is cooked 
and served (generally at night). It is most often pan or deep fried but 
the photo specimen is in Sichuan Mala sauce.

   This product is usually made by rolling up fresh tofu skins,

   Ingredients: soybean, water, salt. Cooking suggestions, "Pan fried, 
   stir  fried with vegetable, hot pot, or soup for flavor" 
   (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t11">11</a>).

   <h2>Tofu Chicken</h2>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; Oval Soy Patty, Vegan
   <br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/bp_tofuchk02e.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Chicken Mold" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Not strictly tofu, except for tofu skin, but all soy, this "chicken" 
   is poured into a thin plastic mold, where it solidifies. Then it 
   is shrink packaged, mold and all, and frozen. The package says it can 
   be used in any recipe calling for chicken. It takes little cooking, 
   so is fine for stir fries, but can also take long cooking without 
   disintegrating. Texture is similar to undercooked chicken, 
   a little chewy. Taste is mild, remeniscent of chicken breast, but 
   with a somewhat beany undertaste.  Ing: Water, textured 
   soybean isolate, textured soybean protein, soy beancurd skin, 
   soybeean oil, soy sauce, sea salt, sugar cane juice, spices 
   (mushroom extract, black pepper).

   <h2>Tofu Duck</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Buddha's Duck
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofuduck03e.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Duck Roll" class=mrg>
   This product is usually made by rolling up fresh tofu skins, compressing 
   in a cloth wrapping and steaming. The cloth is then removed. This 
   process makes the roll very firm with a somewhat duck-like texture. 
   The texture is pleasing and the manufacturer has done a decent job of 
   imparting a duck-like flavor. I rather liked this one. The photo 
   specimen was 7 inches long, 2-3/4 inches across and weighed 15-1/2 ounces. 
   Ingredients: Soybeans, Salt, Sugar, Soy sauce, Soybean oil. This 
   manufacturer (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t10">10</a>) makes a chicken the same shape, 
   size and ingredients but lighter in color.

   <h2>Tofu Chitterlings</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofuchitter01e.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Chitterlings" class=mrg>
   The label, "Fresh Tofu Sausage", has to be a misnomer, euphemism or 
   mis-translation - these are clearly tofu chitterlings (pig intestines) - 
   but they mercifully don't have the smell. Vegetarian Soul Food, anyone?  
   These were made of very thin, somewhat gooey (how appropriate) tofu skin 
   rolled up. Individual chitterlings were about 12 inches long, 7/8 inch 
   diameter and weighed 1-5/8 ounces. The leaves they were rolled from 
   were 0.010 (one 100th) inch thick.The cooking suggestions were, 
   "Pan fried, stir  fried with vegetable, hot pot, marinated". Available in 
   Asian markets in Los Angeles (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t11">11</a>).
   <br class=cll><p></p>


   <h2>Tofurkey</h2>
   <br><a href="../recipes/1mv_tofurk1.html">
   <img src="img/bp_tofurky11e.jpg" alt="Cooked and Served Tofurky" class=mrg></a>
   Tofurkey is an imitation turkey roast generally designed as a vegan 
   stand-in for a roast turkey dinner. It may or may not resemble an 
   actual turkey in shape or taste. Tofurkey is a generic term, Tofurky 
   is a registered trademark of Turtle Island Foods (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t15">
   15</a>). The photo is of their well known Tofurky, 4-3/4 inches long, 
   3-3/4 inches diameter and weighing 1 pound 12 ounces, and mercifully 
   not molded into the shape of a real turkey. Ingredients: far too many 
   to list here (includes roll, stuffing and gravy) but the basic roll 
   includes: water, vital wheat gluten, organic tofu, canola oil, natural 
   vegetarian flavors, shoyu sauce, corn starch, white bean flour, 
   garbanzo bean flour, lemon juice, onion powder, salt, calcium lactate 
   from beets. For Celiac sufferers, it's a "Death Roll". &nbsp;

   <h2>Tofu Cold Cuts</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofudeli01e.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Cold Cuts" class=mrg>
   This is a tough one to do well. It's quite similar to the baked 
   version of <a href="bp_tofuz.html#block">Pressed Tofu Blocks</a>, but with a lot 
   more ingredients to cover up the soy taste and make it more like meat. 
   The photo specimens are Tofurky brand (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t15">15</a>) Hickory 
   Smoked Deli Cuts, 4 inches diameter and 0.04 thick. They're a credible 
   effort - but certainly no bologna (too dry for one thing). 
   Ingredients: vital wheat gluten, organic tofu, canola oil, natural 
   vegetarian flavors, shoyu sauce, corn starch, white bean flour, 
   garbanzo bean flour, lemon juice, calcium lactate from beets.

   <h2>Tofu Italian Sausage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_tofuital03e.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Italian Sausage" class=mrg>
   The photo specimens are Tofurky brand (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t15">15</a>) and are 
   the best tofu sausages I've tried to date. They're a bit overspiced 
   to cover the basic blandness, but have decent texture (though still 
   a bit pasty) and the color is lighter than others I've tried. They 
   brown decently if fried and are generally edible. Ingredients: 
   organic tofu, vital wheat gluten, canola oil, high oleic safflower 
   oil, water, shoyu sauce, sun dried tomatoes, textured wheat protein, 
   basil, black pepper, spices, granulated garlic, salt, chili peppers.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2>Soy Dogs</h2>
   <br><img src="img/bp_soydog01d.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Soydogs" class=mrg>
   "Smart Dogs" (<a href="bp_tofuz.html#t16">16</a>) - you will not mistake these for 
   Ballpark brand franks. They have a slightly chemically taste and a 
   paste texture, but with enough good mustard and chopped onions they'll 
   stand in for a boiled hot dog (they recommend hot water cooking or 
   nuking, not frying or grilling). These don't claim to be tofu but I'm 
   putting them here with the other soy animals anyway. Ingredients: 
   water, soy protein isolate, wheat gluten, evaporated cane juice, less 
   than 2% of natural flavors (from vegetable sources), natural smoke 
   flavor, garlic powder, paprika oleoresin, yeast extract, xanthan gum, 
   guar gum, carrageenan, fermented rice flour, salt, potassium chloride.
