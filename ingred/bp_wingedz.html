<h1>Winged Beans</h1>
<br><img src="img/bp_winged05g.jpg" alt="Fresh Winged Bean pods" class=mrg>
[Manila bean, Goa bean, Mauritius bean, Asparagus pea, Four-angled bean, 
  Four-cornered bean, Winged pea; Sigarilyas, Kalamismis, Parlang 
  (Philippine);  Dau Rong (Viet); <i>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</i>]

This tropical bean may have originated in Madagascar, but is now grown 
throughout the Asian tropics. The pods are the most common part used for 
food, but the tuberous roots are also quite popular. The seeds from 
mature pods, high in protein and oil, are eaten, but require long cooking 
to destroy trypsin inhibitors. Flowers and leaves are also edible and 
quite high in protein. The photo specimens were up to 7 inches long 
and 7/8 ounce.</p>
<p>Because of its high yield, high nutrition, fast growth and easy 
cultivation this bean is considered an "under-utilized" crop well worth 
introducing to tropical regions where it is not yet much grown, such as 
South and Central America, Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Previously, these could be grown only in the tropics, needing heat, 
lots of water and specific day length and night temperature. The new 
Hunan variety from China has made it practical to grow these in 
temperate regions.

<b>Root Tubers</b> of the winged bean can be eaten raw or cooked and are 
20% protein, much higher than other edible roots. They have a nut-like 
flavor. Some varieties don't produce root tubers, and the size of tubers 
is affected by climate (cooler, bigger tubers). The photo specimens were 
being sold as snacks by a street vendor in Burma.

<h3>Leaves and Flowers:</h3> &nbsp; Winged bean flowers and leaves are 
quite edible and the leaves have a much higher protein content than do 
most green leaves, 10% to 15%. Leaves can be cooked like spinach or eaten 
raw in salads, and flowers are a colorful, edible decorative for salads.

<h3>Pods:</h3> &nbsp; These have an interesting flavor, usually described 
as between snap peas and asparagus. They also have a very interesting 
shape and texture, with a light crunchiness. The crunchiness is still 
apparent with simmering up to 30 minutes. They are usually harvested 
between 4 and 6 inches long, but are said to be at their best at 4 inches 
or less.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  These are still very scarce in North America, 
but have finally started to appear in the Asian markets of Los Angeles 
(2017). Some are said to also be grown in southern Florida. The new 
Hunan variety or similar is probably the one now grown in Southern 
California. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $4.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Young pods can be eaten raw in salads, whole 
or cut, depending on size.  In the Philippines, larger beans are often 
just sliced crosswise in short segments and stir fried with shrimp 
or pieces of pork, but they also work well in stews. Care should be 
taken not to over-cook, as they should have some crunch. Larger beans 
(4 to 6 inches) will still have some crunch after simmering up to 30 
minutes.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Snap Peas are probably your best bet, but 
adjust cooking time so they aren't overcooked. Recipes for Winged 
Beans can also be made with Long Beans, but the dark flavor of the 
Long Beans is quite different.<p></p>
