<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The order <i>Brassicales</i> has a modest number of families, just 
16, not many of which are at all familiar to Americans as food (or as 
anything else for that matter) - except that huge culinary superstar 
family <i>Brassicaceae</i> - the Mustards, Cabbages, Turnips and Radishes. 
The link below will take you to the <i>Brassicaceae</i> page. This page 
contains other edible <i>Brassicales</i> - pretty much all of them.

<h3>Cabbages, Mustards, Turnips <small>&amp;</small> Radishes</h3>
<p>
This huge family (Botanists call them all Mustards) accounts for most 
of the winter greens and root vegetables humanity has depended on to make 
it through 'till spring.  Americans, with a seemingly limitless supply of 
cheap meat and potatoes, have held cabbages in disregard, but would do 
well to become more familiar with them for reasons of health, economy and 
because, properly prepared, they taste good.

<p></p>
<h3>[<i>Moringaceae</i>]</h3> &nbsp; This is a family containing a 
single genus, <i>Moringa</i>, with about 13 species. These trees are 
native to northern Africa and South Asia, particularly the Himalayan 
foothills. Nearly all are important medicinal plants and some are 
important for both human and livestock nutrition. Species with 
swollen water storage trunks are planted as exotic decoratives. Seeds 
are of interest for unusually stable biodiesel fuel.<p></p>

   [Horseradish Tree, Malunggay (Philippines), Sajina (India); 
   <i>Moringa oleifera</i>]
   <p>
   This fast growing tree from northern India has been planted 
   worldwide because of it's many uses, only a few of which are as food. The 
   name "Horseradish Tree" comes from the taste of the roots when ground, 
   but they should not be used as a condiment because they contain serious 
   toxins.</p>
   <p>The main food parts are the pods (particularly in India) which 
   may be over 18 inches long, and young leaf shoots (particularly in the 
   Philippines and Africa). Powdered seeds are used to clarify and purify 
   water. Many parts of this tree also have medicinal properties (the 
   seeds are supposed to be good for erectile disfunction).

   [<i>Moringa stenopetala</i>]
   <p>
   This tree, up to 39 feet high, is very similar to <i>M. oleifera</i> 
   but with larger leaflets. It has been domesticated in the Ethiopian 
   Highlands and is grown there on a system of terraces. It has recently 
   been planted in other regions, particularly the Rift Valley. Uses are 
   similar to <i>M. oleifera</i>. Powdered seeds are more effective for 
   clarifying and purifying water than those of <i>M. olieifera</i>.

<h3>[<i>Caricaceae</i>]</h3> &nbsp; This is a small family, formerly 
consisting of a single genus, <i>Carica</i>, but recent genetic analysis 
has split them up into six genera, leaving only one in the original 
<i>Carica</i>. All members of the family are technically herbs, usually 
with a single main stem, but they can appear to be trees, to 33 feet

   <p>
   The only notable member of the family <i>Caricaceae</i>, the Papaya is 
   of Central American origin, but now grown in tropical areas throughout 
   the world. It is very distantly related to Cabbages, but is this plant 
   a "branchless tree" or a giant herb? Technically it's an herb.</p>

   <p>Unripe papayas are used in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam for their 
   famous green papaya salads, and as a cooked vegetable in India and the 
   Philippines. Ripe papayas are eaten as fruit and made into various 
   fruit drinks and concoctions. They are used worldwide as meat 
   tenderizer and digestive aid. In the photo are a medium size Mexican 
   papaya (upper left, 10-1/2 x 5-3/4 inches 5-1/2 pounds), a typical 
   Hawaiian papaya (lower right, 5-1/2 x 3-1/4 inches 1 pound) and an

   This papaya relative is native to the Andes mountains of northwestern 
   South America from Columbia to central Chile. In grows at altitudes 
   between 5000 and 10,000 feet and can stand dryer weather and much 
   colder temperatures than the regular papaya. The fruit can be up to 
   6 inches long and 3 inches diameter. Some are now being grown in the 
   highlands of Kenya, and possibly elsewhere. It is used similarly to 
   the regular papaya, both cooked when immature and eaten raw when fully 
   ripe.

   cold tolerant of the <i>Vasconcellea</i> species.  This unbranched 
   herb, which can grow to 26 feet high and produce 30 to 60 fruits a 
   year, can live as long as 8 years.  It bears only female flowers and 
   seedless fruit with thin, edible skin.  It has been successfully  
   grown in California and New Zealand.

   <p>
   Capers are most known to Americans as pickled flower buds used as a 
   flavoring element and garnish in salads, sauces and martinis. In the 
   Mediterranean region, where they are native, fruits, caperberries, are 
   also pickled, as are the leaves. The photo specimens of pickled flower 
   buds came from two bottles, both qualifying for the top "Non-pareilles" 
   designation, though the large ones barely squeaked by at the 7 mm / 
   0.276 inch maximum. The small ones were typically 4 mm or less.

   <p>
   This large shrub, to 32 feet tall, is native to Africa in the 
   transition band just south of the Sahara Desert, from Senegal to 
   Eritria (the Sahel). It is also found in Yemen, Israel and Egypt, 
   but is nearing extinction in Egypt. It has been very important to 
   nomadic tribes in the semi-desert regions, particularly as fodder 
   for camels and other animals during the dry season, but has been 
   badly overgrazed over much of its range.</p>
   <p>The leaves are an important 
   food for people in Senegal, Mauritania and Niger, used in soups and 
   stews. They are bitter and slightly toxic when raw. Cooked, they taste 
   similar to spinach, but with a much more fibrous texture. After a first 
   cooking they are rinsed out, then pounded in a mortar to make them 
   more tender. They are rich in protein, calcium and iron. The strange 
   "string of beads" fruits are eaten in Mauritania, known there as 
   <i>eb nembe</i>. The plant also has a number of medicinal uses.

   <p>
   This shrub, growing to 15 feet tall, is native to arid regions of 
   Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, particularly northern India. 
   It grows with a dense tangle of leafless branches and can tolerate 
   intense heat and drought, and light frost. The fruits, 3/8 to 3/4 
   inch diameter, are blue-green when unripe, medium to bright pink when 
   ripe. The fruits are spicy and are used as a flavoring for curries 
   and vegetables, and are also very often pickled. Raw they are bitter, 
   acrid and peppery, but they are tamed to piquant and zesty by cooking 
   or pickling. Small ripe berries are preferred to large ones. 
   Buds are also used, similarly to European capers, before they open 
   into red flowers. The plant also has medicinal uses.

   This tree, up to 49 feet high, is native to most of Southeast Asia, 
   including the Philippines, and is also found in Japan and Australia. 
   It is also grown in parts of Africa and other tropical regions for 
   its fruit. It bears large white to light purple flowers, which smell 
   somewhat of garlic. Fruits are oval and fairly large, to almost 6 
   inches long and 2-3/4 inches diameter. They have a hard rough shell, 
   but it is easily broken to expose yellow flesh and large seeds, up to 
   4 inches long. Young shoots and fruit are used in curries. The fruit 
   is used as a spice because of it's strong garlic taste. The plant has 
   a number of medicinal uses.

<p>
This shrub (to 16 feet high) or liana (to 66 feet long) is native to 
tropical Central Africa. The liana form produces a single root tuber, 
the shrub form has more complex roots. The fruits, which may be red or 
mottled gray, between 1-1/2 and 2 inches in diameter, are quite sweet 
and are used locally by simply sucking the flesh off the numerous seeds. 
The roots have many medicinal uses throughout the region, but are said 
to sometimes be eaten as a vegetable.</p> 
<p>This plant came into Western notice in 1985. Since then two sweet 
proteins have been isolated, pentadin and brazzein. Brazzein is being 
studied by the food industry, being 500 to 2000 times sweeter than 
sugar. It will not be harvested from the berries because patented 
genetically modified bacteria have already been developed to produce a 
superior product. This sweetener cannot yet be used in the United States 
because it doesn't have FDA GRAS certification, and is similarly 
restricted in Europe.
