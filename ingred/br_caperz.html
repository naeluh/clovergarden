<h1>Capers <small>&amp;</small> Caperberries</h1>

[<i>Capparis spinosa</i>, 
also <i>C. sicula</i>, <i>C. orientalis</i>, and <i>C. aegyptia</i>. 
Australian "wild passionfruit" <i>Capparis spinosa</i> subspecies

<p>
Caper bushes are found all around the Mediterranean region, but are 
also found in Madagascar, Central Asia, the Himalayas and in the 
Pacific Islands. Where they originated is unknown.</p>

<p>Capers are most known to Americans as pickled flower buds used as a 
flavoring element and garnish in salads, sauces and martinis. In the 
Mediterranean region where they are native, fruits are also pickled, as 
well as the leaves 
The photo specimens of pickled flower buds came from two bottles, both 
qualifying for the top "Non-pareilles" designation, though the large ones 
barely squeaked by at the 7 mm / 0.276 inch maximum. The small ones were 
typically 4 mm or less. Connoisseurs insist salted caper buds are 
superior to pickled, but those are costly and very difficult to find in 
North America.</p>

<p>Capers are graded by size with the smaller considered more desirable. Sizes 
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-pareil (up to 7 mm)</li>
<li>Surfines (7-8 mm)</li>
<li>Capucines (8-9 mm)</li>
<li>Capotes (9-11 mm)</li>
<li>Fines (11-13 mm)</li>
<li>Grusas (14+ mm)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="br_brassicale.html#nastur">Nasturtium</a> buds are sometimes 
substituted for capers, having a similar taste. They are usually in the 
larger sizes.</p>

Caper fruits (caperberries) grow to about 2-3/4 inches long when ripe, 
but they are usually picked immature at about 1 inch and pickled. At 
this young stage the seeds are soft and edible. The berries are served as 
appetizers and in salads, particularly in Spain and Greece. Some are 
salted, rather than pickled, as the buds sometimes are, and are said to 
be superior that way, but salted caperberries are very scarce and costly 
in North America. The pickled specimens in the photo were up to 1.1 
inches long and 0.78 inch diameter, weighing an average of 0.16 ounce 
(4.8 grams) each. From Spain: Caperberries, water, salt, vinegar.

<p>Leaves are thick and succulent. They are also pickled, and are 
sometimes cooked for use in salads. These usages are local, and not 
exported. Caper leaves are also used in place of rennet in coagulating 
some cheeses.

Neither flowers nor ripe fruit are much eaten (though perhaps flowers are 
used as edible decorations on salads). These photos are provided 
to illustrate the edible leaves, and because they were available from 
earlier versions of this page. Caperberries split open when ripe, 
exposing white flesh and black seeds. &nbsp; <small>Photo of flower by
