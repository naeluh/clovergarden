<p>
This fast growing tree from northern India has been planted worldwide 
because of it's many uses, only a few of which are as food. The name 
"Horseradish Tree" comes from the taste of the roots when ground, but they 
should not be used as a condiment because they contain serious toxins. The 
main food parts are the pods (particularly in India) which may be over 18 
inches long, and young leaf shoots (particularly in the Philippines but 
also in India). Many parts of this tree also have medicinal properties 
(the seeds are supposed to be good for erectile disfunction).

<h2>Drumstick Pods</h2>
<br><img src="img/br_drums07g.jpg" alt="Moringa Drumsticks" class=mrg>
"Drumsticks" are very commonly used in Indian cuisine. Immigrants 
to the US are often quite surprised when they ask for "drumsticks" in the 
markets and are referred to the chicken section. These "drumsticks"  are 
becoming increasingly available in Indian and Philippine markets here in 
California, but are still expensive (2013 US $6.00 / pound) and 
availability is still erratic.

<p>Eating the pods can be problematic. In India, very young pods are 
often used, when they can be cooked much like green beans. Here in 
Southern California we get only the mature, hard as wood pods. With a 
fairly mature pod the shell remains very hard and woody even with long 
cooking. This is not a problem in India - they eat everything with their 
fingers (why soup is almost unknown in India - they don't have spoons). 
Here you can treat them as you would Artichoke leaves, Cut into 3 to 4 
inch lengths, boil 10 minutes or steam 15, split them open and scrape 
out the pulp and seeds by drawing across your teeth, then discard the 
woody shell. Taste is pleasant, a bit like green beans and zucchini but 
more complex.

<h2>Malunggay leaves</h2>	 
<br><img src="img/br_drums13f.jpg" alt="Moringa Leaves" class=mrg>
[Mienda (Swahili); Odudu oyibo, Okwe oyibo, Okwe olu, Uhe, Oku-ghara-ite 
(Igbo); Igi iyanu, Malero, Ewele, Ew&eacute; il&eacute;, 
Ewe Igb&aacute;l&eacute;, Idagbo monoy&eacute; (Yoruba); Zogale (Hausa); 
<i>Moringa oleifera</i>]
<p>
Malunggay leaves are used in the Philippines in great quantity and are 
one of the most nutritious vegetables known, high in calcium, protein, 
fiber, phosphorus, iron, beta-carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, 
vitamin C and antioxidants. Many Filipinos hold strong childhood memories 
of malunggay leaves in soups - some with delight and some with horror. 
These leaves are also used in West Africa, particularly Nigeria.</p>

<h3>Buying and Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh leaves can occasionally be 
found in well stocked markets serving Philippine communities (in 
California surrounding any large medical center - without Filipino 
immigrants we would have no health system at all). They can be kept 
loosely bagged in the refrigerator for a few days at most.<p></p>

<h3>Frozen:</h3> &nbsp; Flat bags of frozen leaves can always be found 
in the freezer cases of Philippine markets, deceptively labeled 
"Horseradish Leaves". Jars of brined leaves can be found in some other 
Asian markets. Dried powdered leaves are used in parts of India but I 
haven't noticed them in the Indian markets here. An 8 ounce package is 
mostly water and will yield about 2-1/4 ounces of leaves after thawing 
and wringing out, but that's about the right amount for a fairly 
large pot of soup.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or frozen, malunggay leaves should be 
added to soups in the very last moments before serving or they tend to get 
slimy.
