<h1>Papayas</h1>

[Pawpaw, Mamao, Lechoza, <i>Carica papaya</i>]
<p>
The only notable member of the family <i>Caricaceae</i>, the Papaya is 
of Central American origin, but now grown in tropical regions throughout 
the world. It is very distantly related to Cabbages, but is this plant 
a "branchless tree" or a giant herb? Technically it's an herb.</p>

<p>Unripe papayas are used in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam for their 
famous green papaya salads, and as a cooked vegetable in India and the 
Philippines. Ripe papayas are eaten as fruit and made into various 
fruit drinks and concoctions. They are used worldwide as meat 
tenderizer and digestive aid. In the photo are a medium size Mexican 
papaya (upper left, 10-1/2 x 5-3/4 inches 5-1/2 pounds), a typical 
Hawaiian papaya (lower right, 5-1/2 x 3-1/4 inches 1 pound) and an 
unripe "green" papaya cut in half (top right).</p>

<p>Hawaiian papayas have flesh that is sweeter, more delicately 
flavored, and lighter in color than Mexican papayas. On the other 
hand, the photo specimens were purchased for 2014 US $2.99 / pound 
for the Hawaiian, $0.69 / pound for the Mexican, and $1.49 / pound 
for the green.</p>

<p>Ripe papaya seeds have a spicy taste similar to a mild black pepper, 
and are sometimes used as a substitute for that spice, or in India as an 
adulterant. Young papaya leaves are eaten like spinach in some tropical 
areas, but mature leaves have an effect on the heart similar to digitalis, 
though they can be cooked in several changes of water to remove this 
effect and their bitterness.</p> 

<h3>Buying</h3>: &nbsp; Ripe Hawaiian papayas are carried in many 
supermarkets, and Mexican papayas in ethnic markets serving Mexican, 
Central American, Caribbean, Southeast Asian and other communities of 
tropical Origin.
<p>Unripe papayas can be found in markets serving a South or Southeast 
Asian community, particularly Filipino. Ideally, they should be 
completely white as in the photo above, though I've successfully used 
papayas with just a trace of pink blush around mostly black seeds.</p>

<h3>Ripening <small>&amp;</small> Storage:</h3> &nbsp;  Papayas will 
continue to ripen if simply set out on a counter. <b>Caution:</b> the 
expensive Hawaiian, if just a little over-ripe, will start to get small 
depressions on the skin - but these go deep into the flesh. If you see 
any forming, it's time to eat them. Mexican papayas are less prone to 
this problem, but must still be watched for it. Unripe papayas can be 
stored in the refrigerator for even a couple of weeks - if cut, wrap 
tightly in plastic wrap.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Green (unripe) papayas are widely used in 
curries in India, in stews and stir fries in the Philippines, and raw 
in the famous Green Papaya Salads of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. They 
are a good tropical substitute for potatoes in soups but should not 
be cooked too long. In the Philippines they are often cut into fine 
juliennes and pickled. Some recipes will be found on our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/inding.html">Recipes by Ingredients</a> page.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Chayote squash is considered the best substitute 
for Green Papaya, but will need just a little longer cooking time.
