Native to the U.S. Southwest, this is one of a very few wild plants 
still significantly used for food in North America. The Zuni people 
in particular cook young shoots, leaves and flowers as a vegetable, 
and hang leaves to dry for winter use. It's bitter taste is sometimes 
relieved by adding some iron or rust to the pot. Seeds can be eaten 
raw or cooked, and are dried and ground to make mush. The plant is 
also often planted among the usual "Three Sisters" (corn, squash and 
beans) to attract polinating bees to the garden.</p>
<p>This plant has a number of medicinal uses and is used to make 
dyes for pottery, baskets and fabrics.

bitter leaves, which also have some sharpness like mustard leaves, are 
eaten fresh, dried or cooked.</p>

are used similarly to mustard seeds, mainly in the plain south of the 
Himalayan foothills. the seeds can be pressed for a cooking oil. The 
seeds are becoming popular in India as a low cost substitute for Cumin, 
and it's cultivation is being encouraged because it grows better on 
marginal land than conventional crops. this plant has a number of 
medicinal uses.
