<h1>Buckthorn Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The Buckthorn family (<i>Rhamnaceae</i>) is a modest size family 
of mostly thorny flowering plants found in temperate and subtropical 
climates worldwide. The family provides only a few food items, but it is 
used to make green and yellow dyes. Historically, it's most important use 
was in the making of charcoal for use in gunpowder, but, except for a few 
black powder hobbyists, gunpowder has been replaced by other propellants. 
In this article we treat only edible buckthorns.

<h2>Jujube</h2>
<br><a href="bt_jujuz.html">
<img src="img/od_juju08h.jpg" alt="Fresh, Dried and Candied Jujubes" class=mrg></a>
[Red Date, Chinese Date; Annab (Persia, dried); Taejuja (Korea); 
Hong zao (China, dried), Hei zao (China, dried and smoked); 
<i>Ziziphus zizyphus</i>]
<p>
<p>Jujube fruit trees were first domesticated in India about 11,000 
years ago. Their natural range is uncertain because of long cultivation 
but may have extended from Syria to southern China. They belong to the 
Buckthorn family (<i>Rhamnaceae</i>), a fairly large family but one 
yielding very few edibles.</p>
<p>The fruit is initially green but turns red when fully ripe and 
eventually shrivels. It is very light, almost foam like, moderately 
sweet. and apple-like in flavor. The photo shows fresh (top), dried 
(left) and candied (right). Fresh are about 1.7 inches long, 1.6 inches 
diameter and weigh just over 1 ounce. &nbsp;

<h2>California Coffeeberry</h2>
<br>
<img src="img/bt_calcoff01h.jpg" alt="Coffee Berries on Shrub" class=mrg>
[<i>Frangula californica</i>, formerly <i>Rhamnus californica</i>]
<p>
This moderate size shrub (usually 3 to 6 feet tall) is native to many 
scrub and forest habitats in western California, extending into 
coastal Oregon and Baja California. It bears juicy fruit, ripening from 
green through red to black, about 3/8 inch long, containing two seeds 
that resemble coffee beans. The resemblance doesn't end there, as these 
seeds are considered an excellent non-caffeinated coffee substitute, said 
to have overtones of Mocha. The fruit can be made into jams and jellies, 
and was used by California Natives as both food and medicine.

<h2 id="shiny">Shiny-leaf Buckthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/bt_shiny01h.jpg" alt="Shiny-Leaf Buckthorn Twig with Leaves and Berries" class=mrg>
[African Dogwood; Geso, Gesho (Eritria, Ethiopia); 
Blinkblaar (Afrikaans); <i>Rhamnus prinoides</i>]
<p>
This srub is native to eastern Africa from Eritria and Ethiopia south 
into South Africa. In Eritria and Ethiopia, twigs and leaves are pounded 
to produce a bitter flavoring with antibacterial properties used in 
brewing local beers (Tella) and mead (Tej, Mase), similarly to how Hops 
are used in brewing European beer. The berries, which ripen from green 
through red to purple, are less than 1/4 inch diameter, but are edible. 
The main uses for this plant in much of its growing region are magical 
and medicinal.

<h2>Raisin Tree</h2>
<br><img src="img/bt_raisin01h.jpg" alt="Live Raisin Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Hovenia dulcis</i>]
<p>
This fast growing tree is native to Eastern China, Korea, and as far 
south as Thailand (rare). The edible "raisins", eaten both raw and 
cooked, are not actually a fruit, but a short, swollen mature flower 
stalk or peduncle which supports the inedible seed pod. As the pod 
matures, the stem attaching it to the fruit cluster swells and turns a 
translucent reddish brown. A pear-like flavor develops as the sugars 
increase, and the peduncle is ready to eat when it falls to the ground. 
Although small, close to the size of raisins, the 
crop is large.</p>
<p>An extract from the seeds is used as a substitute for honey and used in 
candy and fruit wine. This tree is being considered as a reforestation 
tree to replace eucalyptus, which is toxic to other plants. The timber 
is also useful, where eucalyptus timber twists and is useful only as 
firewood.

<h2>New Jersey Tea</h2>
<br><img src="img/bt_njtea01h.jpg" alt="Live New Jersy Tea Flowers" class=mrg>
[Red Root, Indian Tea, wild snowball, mountain sweet; 
<i>Ceanothus americanus</i>]
<p>
Native to most of the eastern half of North America, leaves of this plant 
were used as a substitute for imported tea during the American 
Revolution. Today, all parts of the plant are used as herbal medicinals.
