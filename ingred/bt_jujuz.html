Jujube fruit trees were first domesticated in India about 11,000 
years ago. Their natural range is uncertain because of long cultivation 
but may have extended from Syria to southern China. They belong to the 
Buckthorn family (<i>Rhamnaceae</i>), a fairly large family but one 
yielding very few edibles.</p>
<p>The fruit is initially green but turns red when fully ripe and 
eventually shrivels. It is very light, almost foam like, moderately 
sweet. and apple-like in flavor. The photo shows fresh (top), dried 
(left) and candied (right). Fresh are about 1.7 inches long, 1.6 inches 
diameter and weigh just over 1 ounce.</p>

<p>Fresh and candied jujubes are eaten as snacks. Dried they are a 
flavoring ingredient for soups and stews. In China dried jujubes 
(<i>hong zao</i>) may be smoked (<i>hei zao</i>) and will then be black 
instead of red. They are also used for teas and beverages. Jujube teas 
are reputed to be a good treatment for colds and sore throat.</p>

<p>Jujubies are also used in Morocco, commonly grown in the Atlas 
Mountains region. They are used to add sweet-sour flavors to tagines 
and other stews.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh jujubes are available in some of the 
multi-ethnic produce markets here in Southern California when they 
are in season. Those in the photo were purchased from Sunland Produce 
in Sunland, California, in late July. Dried and Candied can be found 
in most markets serving an East Asian community.<p></p>
