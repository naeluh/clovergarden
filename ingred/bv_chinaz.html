[Huangjiu,  Shaoxing wine]
<p>
This wine is called for in thousands of Chinese recipes. The most 
accepted  varieties are made in Shaoxing on the eastern coast of China. 
About 110,000 tons are made every year and it is commonly and economically 
available in North America. This wine is aged underground for years in 
large ceramic jars, but it is put up in regular wine bottles for export. 
Most bottles I've seen here in Los Angeles are labeled <i>Shao Hsing</i> 
or <i>Shao Hsing Hua Tiao</i></p>
<p>Huangjiu is made in dry (<i>Gan</i>), semi-dry (<i>Ban Gan</i>), 
semi-sweet (<i>Ban Tian</i>), sweet (<i>Tian</i>) and extra sweet 
(<i>Nong Tian</i>). The main export to North America is Dry, with some 
Semi-dry sold for drinking at special occasions.</p>
<p>For cooking, select a good drinkable wine. Suitable varieties are 
available here in Los Angeles for between US $3.00 and $4.00 for a 750 ml 
bottle. More expensive versions in ceramic jars are also available, but 
more for drinking than for cooking. Select wine with an alcohol content 
around 17% so it can be stored unrefrigerated. Caution: China also makes 
some regular grape wines and puts them up in similar bottles, so read 
the label. Generally, just a tablespoon or two are used in a recipe.

<p><u>Do Not Use</u> Chinese "cooking" wine, available in clear and 
tinted varieties. This is inferior wine to start with and heavily salted 
to avoid paying the liquor tax. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Subst:</b> The most acceptable substitute is a dry (Fino) Sherry. 
Although also made from rice, Japanese Sake is <u>not</u> considered an 
acceptable substitute.</p>
