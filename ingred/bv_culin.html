<h1>Culinary Beverages</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Many beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic are used 
in cooking to provide unique flavors. Some, particularly beer, have 
themselves been categorized as food. It has long been known that the 
pyramids of Egypt were built on bread, beer and onions.  The city that 
supported building the Great Pyramid has now been found and is being 
excavated. In the words of one archaeologist, "We knew beer was involved, 
but we had no idea how much beer - there's a brewry on almost every 
block".</span><p></p>
<span class=bg>Many beverages are used to accompany meals, so, even 
though they may have just a small place in cooking, they can be 
considered as "culinary beverages" - they just get added to the recipe 
in a different way.</span>

<h2 class=lrgp id="alco">Alcoholic Beverages</h2>

<p>Use of alcoholic beverages is older than humantiy itself. In nature, 
birds, bears and elephants are noted to particularly like them, so it's 
a good bet our pre-human ancestors were already indulging in over-ripe 
berries.</p>

<p>Beer and wine have been made since before the beginning of 
civilization. Many archaeologists now think the first permanent 
agricultural settlements were established as a means for producing a 
reliable supply of beer and wine. The earliest are often associated 
with ceremonial or burial sites. In Armenia, a sophisticated wine 
production facility has been found that was in operation more than 
6000 years ago, but evidence of wine extends 1000 years farther 
back.</p>

<p>Many alcoholic beverages are used in cooking. Most of the alcohol 
quickly evaporates, but there will always be a trace amount, so if you 
belong to a religious sect that strictly prohibits alcohol, you have a 
judgement call to make.  Since ripe fruit and fermented foods often 
contain some alcohol, that may be your justification, but if your Imam 
spots you in Trader Joe's buying booze, you may be in for a scolding.
</p>

<h2>Beer <small>and</small> Ale</h2>
<br><img src="img/bv_beer02h.jpg" alt="Glasses of Light and Dark" class=mrg>
 Beer was originally associated with bread making 
and has long been used as a food, and as an ingredient in recipes. It is 
made from sprouted grains (mostly barley) that are then roasted until dry 
(or until lightly browned for dark beers). This "malt" is then fermented 
with special yeast and pure water. Generally a bitter element such as hops 
is added to adjust the flavor and as a preservative.
<p>In current usage, "Ale" refers to a beer where fermentation is at room 
temperature and at the top of the vat, while "Beer" is fermented cold with 
the yeast sinking to the bottom of the vat. Practically, there's not much 
difference. The alcohol content of beer ranges from less than 3% to about 
14% by volume, but averages just under 5% and is very rarely over 7% in 
North America. Non-alcoholic beer is less than 0.5% alcohol by volume.</p>
<p>Beer is used in cooking in all countries that drink beer, but is most 
prevalent throughout Europe. Beer comes in many shades, from very light 
amber to nearly black, the coloring coming mostly from the roasting of 
the malted (sprouted) grain used (usually barley). Any recipe that calls 
for cooking with beer should specify the shade to use. As with other 
ingredients, always select a quality beer for cooking. &nbsp; 
<b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; There is no substitute for beer, but that's not a 
problem because beer is easily available worldwide (except, perhaps, in a 
few remote Islamic villages), and fairly easy to make yourself should the 
need arise.

<h2>Brandy</h2>
<br><img src="img/bv_brand02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Brandy" class=mrg>
Brandy is a distilled liquor usually made from grape wine and bottled at 
about 40% alcohol by volume. It is made in many countries worldwide in a 
vast range of qualities and prices and is a common ingredient in the cuisines 
of Europe and North America. Brandies are also made from a variety of sweet, 
fermentable fruits such as apples, plums, pears and peaches.
<p>Cognac, the most famous brandy, was invented by a Dutch factor in France 
as a way to concentrate poor quality wine so he could afford wartime insurance 
rates for shipping to Holland. His employers quickly discovered the error of 
his instruction to dilute it back to wine. When they figured out what he was 
doing the French ran him out of town and took over his stills. Cognac is still 
made from inferior wine.. 
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Calvados</h2>
<br><img src="img/bv_calvad01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Calvados" class=mrg>
Calvados is a high grade Applejack brandy made in Normandy, France, much used 
as an essential cooking ingredient in recipes from the northwest corner of 
France. It is made by distilling fermented apple cider (hard cider) and has 
an alcohol content of around 40%.
<p><b>Subst:</b> Other brandies can be used but won't have the distinctive 
apple flavor desirable for Norman cuisine. Pear brandy would probably be the 
closest but is generally less available than Calvados.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cherry Heering</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_cherryh02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Liqueur" class=mrg>
<p>This is a sweet cherry flavored liqueur made by Peter F Heering Co. of 
Denmark. It is very flavorful and world famous, so is called for in many 
cuisines, particularly in baking. It is also an ingredient in many mixed 
drinks. Alcohol content is 24%.
<b>Subst:</b> Another cherry liqueur may be usable if it is strongly 
flavored and quite sweet.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chinese Rice Wine</h2>  
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
<img src="img/bv_china02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Wine" class=mrg>
<img src="img/bv_china03s.jpg" alt="Bottle of Wine" class=mrg></a>
[Huangjiu,  Shaoxing wine] 
<p>
This wine is called for in thousands of Chinese recipes. The most 
accepted  varieties are made in Shaoxing on the eastern coast of China. 
About 110,000 tons are made very year and it is commonly and economically 
available in North America. This wine is aged underground for years in 
large ceramic jars, but it is put up in regular wine bottles (and also 
fancy ceramic bottles) for export. The main export to North America is 
Dry, with some Semi-dry sold for drinking at special occasions.</p>
<p>For cooking, select a good drinkable wine. Suitable varieties are 
available here in Los Angeles for between US $3.00 and $4.00 for a 750 
ml bottle. <u>Do Not Use</u> Chinese "cooking" wine, available in clear 
and tinted varieties. This is inferior wine to start with and heavily 
salted to avoid paying the liquor tax.

<h2>Gin - London Dry</h2>
<br><img src="img/bv_ginl01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Gin" class=mrg>
<p>
[Bombay Gin] 
</p><p>London Gin is made by re-distilling grain alcohol along with 
juniper berries and a wide variety of other botanicals. These may include 
any of lemon, bitter orange peel, anise, angelica root and seed, orris 
root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, 
grapefruit peel, dragon eye, saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, 
grains of paradise, nutmeg and cassia bark. Alcohol content is generally 
40% or somewhat higher.</p>
<p>Gin isn't used for cooking nearly as much as beer, wine, or brandy, 
but it does occasionally show up, primarily in meat recipes. &nbsp; 
<b>Subst:</b> vermouth is much lower in alcohol but has plenty of 
botanicals - different but often workable.</p>
<p><b>Guys:</b> &nbsp; If you think that hot date may go "all the way", 
avoid gin like the plague - it can negatively impact performance. While 
I discovered this independently (fortunately not disastrously), it has 
also been noticed by others.  "Gin ... it's inclined to affect me 
prowess" - Flanders and Swann, from <i>Have some Madeira, M'Dear</i>.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Gin - Jenever</h2>  
<br><img src="img/bv_gind02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Jenever" class=mrg>
<p>
[Hollandes, Dutch Gin]
</p><p>Gin was invented by Dutch physician Franciscus Sylvius, who wished to 
make a stomach potion exploiting the medicinal properties of Juniper 
Berries. He made an extraction using distilled alcohol, put it on the 
market - and soon found that stomach problems seemed to be far more 
prevalent in Amsterdam than he had anticipated. Thus was invented the 
first commercial hard liquor. Discovering it in Holland during the 
Eighty Years War, English soldiers called it "Dutch Courage".</p>

<p><b>Do Not</b> use Jenever in mixed drinks. <b>Do Not</b> use Jenever in 
recipes unless it is specifically called for. Jenever is kept in the 
freezer and taken in a full shot glass brought directly from the freezer 
- sometimes with a chaser of lager beer.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Madeira</h2> 
<br><a href="bv_madeirz.html">
<img src="img/bv_madeir04h.jpg" alt="Glassses of Madeira" class=mrg></a>
[Malmsey (England)]
<p>Real Madeira is made only on the islands of Madeira, a Portuguese 
possession far off the western coast of North Africa. This wine undergoes 
a high temperature aging imitating a long sea voyage through the tropics. 
It was hugely popular in warmer regions before refrigeration because it is 
practically immortal in the bottle and lasts well even after opening. 
From this legacy it is called for in many European recipes as well as 
those from the U.S. Southeast and Brazil.</p>

<p>This is a fortified wine with neutral grape spirits added at the end of 
fermentation or at various stages during fermentation depending 
on the sweetness desired. Alcohol is about 18% by volume. Dry Madeira is 
fermented off the skins and will be amber in color. Sweet versions are 
fermented on the skins to balance sweetness with acid and tannin, so they 
will be red. It is the dryer Madeiras that are normally used for cooking. 
&nbsp; <a href="bv_madeirz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Marsala</h2>
<br><img src="img/bv_marsal01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Marsala" class=mrg>
This wine is made on the island of Sicily, currently part of Italy. It is 
much used in Sicilian recipes and often in immodest quantities. Both Dry 
and Sweet versions are made, but it is the dry that is normally used for 
cooking.
<p>I find the US $4.00 brands stocked by Trader Joe's fine for cooking 
and affordable in the quantities needed. The $17.00 bottles from the 
local liquor merchant are superior for sipping, but it's fiscally painful 
to pour a whole bottle into the stew pot. The San Antonio Winery in Los 
Angeles makes a California Marsala, but it's not as common as their 
California Madeira, perhaps because the Sicilian product is quite 
available.</p>

<p>At about 18% alcohol by volume Marsala can be kept unrefrigerated for 
some weeks in a cool place away from light. Longer for sweet than dry, 
and longer for cooking wines than for sipping wines. &nbsp; 
<b>Subst:</b>  a medium dry sherry such as an Amontillado or a cooking 
grade Madeira are acceptable.
<br class=cll></p>



<h2>Mirin</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/jig_mirinf1.html">
<img src="img/bv_mirin02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Mirin" class=mrg></a>
This Japanese "cooking wine" is 8% to 14% alcohol, but has such a high 
sugar content it doesn't spoil unrefrigerated - it's sake preserved in 
sugar. Mirin is a very common ingredient in Japanese and Korean cooking, 
but little known in other cuisines.
<p>Actually real mirin is very difficult to find even here in Los Angeles - 
but there are plenty of brands of "Mirin style" concoctions based on 
Glucose or Corn syrup (Fructose). On the other hand, it takes only a few 
minutes to make something much closer to the authentic by our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/jig_mirinf1.html"><b>Mirin - Non-Traditional</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>



<h2>Port</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_port02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Port" class=mrg>
Invented in Portugal for export to England where very sweet wines were 
much desired, port is made sweet by killing the fermentation with brandy 
before all the grape sugar is converted to alcohol. The brandy brings 
the alcohol content up to about 18% by volume. 
<p>Port is often used in cooking, particularly for port sauces. A cooking 
port can be kept unrefrigerated in a cool place away from light for a few 
months, but a fine sipping port should be handled more carefully, 
refrigerated if to be kept more than a few hours and consumed in short 
order. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rum</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_rum01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Rum" class=mrg>
[Demon Rum (U.S. prohibitionists); Rumbullion, Kill-Devil (early 
Caribbean); Bumbo (Pirates)]
<p>
Rum is a distilled liquor made from sugar cane molasses. In the 18th and 
early 19th centuries, New England was a major distiller of rum, making 
it from vast quantities of molasses from sugar cane grown by slaves in 
the Caribbean. Some of this rum found its way back to Africa, sold to buy 
slaves for shipment to the Caribbean, but the main "Triangular Trade" 
was with Europe, not New England. Before the American Revolution every 
man, woman and child in the colonies consumed an average of 3 gallons 
of rum per year (less for children with adult males taking up the slack).
</p>

<p>Today Jamaica and other Caribbean islands are the most prominent 
producers. Rum comes in many quality grades and two types, white and 
gold. Some use white rum for mixed drinks, but for cooking and sipping 
golden rum, aged in barrels, is more flavorful and far superior.</p>
<p>in the U.S. the most prominent culinary uses of rum are in sweet 
baked goods, including the traditional but infamously inedible fruit 
cake.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sake</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_sake01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Sake" class=mrg>
This Japanese beverage is more a beer than a wine, but its alcohol content of 
15% or higher allows it to be kept unrefrigerated. It comes in a very wide 
variety of qualities and prices, in regular and "Junmai" (traditionally 
made). It is used in many Japanese recipes, and some by California chefs, 
but is pretty much unknown in other cuisines. 
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2>Sherry</h2> 
<br><a href="bv_sherrz.html">
<img src="img/bv_sherry03f.jpg" alt="Glasses of Sherry" class=mrg></a>
[Sack (England), Apera (Australia)]
<p>
Real Sherry is made in and around Jerez,  Spain, and only in Spain, by a 
complex "Solara" system where new wine is put in the top barrels of a stack 
of barrels and slowly works its way to the bottom as it ages. It is made in 
many quality grades and prices and in several steps from dry to sweet. The 
photo shows dry (Fino) on the left, medium dry (Amontillado) in the center 
and very sweet Cream Sherry on the right. Most Cream Sherry is exported to 
England where sweet wines are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Sherry is one of the premier wines for use in cooking and can stand in 
for some other fortified wines that may not be so easy to find. Fino 
grade is considered a reasonable substitute for Chinese Rice Wine. 
&nbsp; <a href="bv_sherrz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Vermouth</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_verm03s.jpg" alt="Glass of Vermouth" class=mrg>
This fortified wine has been made in Italy since the 16th century and France 
nearly as long, taking its name from the German word for wormwood. Red wine 
can be used but white wine is much more common. It is fortified with alcohol 
and flavored with a variety of aromatic botanicals which can include wormwood, 
cloves, cinnamon, quinine, citrus peel, cardamom, marjoram, chamomile, 
coriander, juniper, hyssop, and ginger. Exact formulas are kept secret by 
manufacturers.
<p>It comes in two varieties: dry and sweet. Due to its extensive use in 
martinis, dry vermouth is very common in North America and sweet vermouths 
very much less so. In cooking it is used similarly to white wine, but has 
a more distinct botanical flavor. At 18% alcohol by volume it can be stored 
unrefrigerated in a cool place away from light, but the aromatics may fade 
with time..
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Vodka</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_vodka01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Vodka" class=mrg>
A good grade of vodka consists of absolute ethyl alcohol and distilled 
water. It has no flavor except the alcohol, which boils off in cooking. 
Despite this vodka is increasingly used in cooking, particularly by the 
current generation of innovative chefs. While it has no flavor of its 
own, the alcohol can extract flavors from other ingredients. Also it 
can make a reliable flamb&eacute;.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2>Wine - Dry</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_wine02h.jpg" alt="Glasses of Red and White" class=mrg>
Wine has been made since the depths of prehistory. In fact, winemaking 
and beer brewing were at the very foundation of civilization. Dry Table 
Wines are the most used beverages in cooking, both red and white, 
depending on other ingredients and ethnicity of the recipe. Excellent 
wines are now made in most Western countries and Australia. Fine wines 
were also made in Persia until radical fundamentalist sects destroyed 
Islamic civilization.
<p>Always use a good drinkable wine, never a "cooking" wine which is 
generally of poor quality. Here in California very drinkable wines can 
be had for between US $3.00 and $4.00 per 750ml bottle, probably about 
$1.00 higher elsewhere in the country. Once opened, a recorked bottle of 
wine will keep for at least a couple weeks refrigerated, but in most 
households someone will drink it long before then. Moderate wine drinking 
has been shown more healthful than avoiding alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; There is no substitute for real wine, but that's 
not a problem because wine is easily available worldwide (except, perhaps, 
in a few remote Islamic villages). In a household that simply does not 
drink wine but wants some for cooking, a dry fortified wine such as 
Vermouth, Madeira or Marsala can be kept on hand. A bit different, but 
workable in most cases.
