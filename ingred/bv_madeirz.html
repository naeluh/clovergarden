<h1>Madeira</h1>
<br><img src="img/bv_madeir04f.jpg" alt="Glasses of White and Red Madeira" class=mrg>
[Malmsey (England)]
<p>
Real Madeira is made only on the islands of Madeira, a Portuguese 
possession far off the western coast of North Africa. This wine undergoes 
a high temperature aging imitating a long sea voyage through the tropics. 
It was hugely popular in warmer regions before refrigeration because it 
is practically immortal in the bottle and even lasts well after opening. 
From this legacy it is called for in many European recipes as well as 
those from the U.S. Southeast and Brazil.</p>

<p>This is a fortified wine with neutral grape spirits added at the end 
of fermentation or at various stages during fermentation depending 
on the sweetness desired. Alcohol is about 18% by volume. Dry Madeira is 
fermented off the skins and will be amber in color. Sweet versions are 
fermented on the skins to balance sweetness with acid and tannin, so they 
will be red. It is the dryer Madeiras that are normally used for cooking.
<p>

<p>Two classes of grape are used. The "ordinary" grapes are Tinta Negra 
Mole and Complexa. The "noble" varieties are Sercial, Verdelho, Boal / 
Bual, and Malvasia / Malmsey. Labeling rules are different for these two 
groups as explained below.</p>

<p>Madeira for cooking is made from the "ordinary" grapes, aged for only 
3 years and labeled "Finest". Real Madeira is very scarce here in Southern 
California and likely to be expensive, but the historic San Antonio Winery 
of Los Angeles makes a light California Madeira which is affordable and 
quite suitable for cooking. &nbsp; <b>Subst:</b> an Amontillado 
(medium dry) sherry or dry Marsala are acceptable.</p>

<h3>Grapes <small>&amp;</small> Sweetness</h3>

<p>These levels carry the names of the variety of grapes used. Wines made 
from Tinta Negra Mole and other grapes may not use this system but must be 
labeled seco (dry), meio seco (medium dry), meio doce (medium sweet), 
and doce (sweet). Wines made with at least 85% of the "noble" labeled 
varieties use this system.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Sercial:</b> &nbsp; Light colored and dry - fully fermented until 
  little sugar remains.</li>
<li><b>Verdelho:</b> &nbsp; Fairly dry, light color. Fermentation is stopped 
  when only a small amount of sugar remains.</li>
<li><b>Boal / Bual:</b> &nbsp; Moderately sweet, dark color and rich flavor with 
  a raisin flavors.</li>
<li><b>Malvasia / Malmsey:</b> &nbsp; Quite sweet, very dark with 
  coffee-caramel flavors - a favorite in England.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aging</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Finest:</b> &nbsp; Aged for at least 3 years, usually used for 
    cooking.</li>
  <li><b>Reserve:</b> &nbsp; Aged 5 years. May be made with "noble" 
    varieties. </li>
  <li><b>Special Reserve:</b> &nbsp; Aged 10 years, often without artificial 
    heat.</li>
  <li><b>Extra Reserve:</b> &nbsp; Aged 15 years, richer than Special 
    Reserve but not often made.</li>
  <li><b>Colheita / Harvest:</b> &nbsp; Aged 15 years or more. It can be 
    labeled with a vintage year provided the word Colheita is appended.</li>
  <li><b>Vintage / Frasquiera:</b> &nbsp; Aged at least 20 years and labeled 
    with a vintage date.</li>
  </ul>
