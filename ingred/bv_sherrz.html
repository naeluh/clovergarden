<p>
Real Sherry is made in and around Jerez,  Spain, and only in Spain, by a 
complex "Solara" system where new wine is put in the top barrels of a stack 
of barrels and slowly works its way to the bottom as it ages. The name 
"Sherry" can be used only for wine from the designated Jerez region of 
Spain. The exception is the United States where the name can be used with 
a prefix, such as "California Sherry".</p>

<p>Sherry is made in many quality grades and prices and in several steps 
from dry to sweet. The photo shows dry (Fino) on the left, medium dry 
(Amontillado) in the center and very sweet Cream Sherry on the right. 
Most Cream Sherry is exported to England where sweet wines are highly 
appreciated. "Cooking Sherry" can be presumed to be a grade unsuitable 
for drinking.</p>

<p>Sherry is one of the premier wines for use in cooking and can stand in 
for some other fortified wines that may not be so easy to find. Fino 
grade is considered an acceptable substitute for Chinese Rice Wine.</p>
<p>For drinking, fine grades of Fino and Manzanilla should be consumed 
quickly, as for regular wines, but lesser grades, perfectly suitable for 
cooking, have a 17% alcohol level so can be stored in a cool place away 
from light for a few months and still be good. Sweeter grades can be 
stored longer than dry.</p>

<p>Sherry is made from white Palomino grapes, except the very sweet 
dessert versions which are made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes 
or a blend. After full fermentation, sherry is fortified with brandy 
to bring up its alcohol level. It is then aged in a Solera for a 
minimum of 3 years. Except for the non-Palomeno desert types, sherry 
is fairly dry, but is sweetened before bottling to a degree determined 
by the producer.</p>

<h2>Types of Sherry</h2>

<p>For each type there are numerous producers, and each may generate a 
somewhat different flavor and sweetness. The only way to tell exactly 
what a type tastes like is to taste it, and than stick with that 
producer if you like it. The type definitions below are a general 
guide.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Fino:</b> &nbsp; The lightest colored and dryest traditional variety 
  of sherry. It is aged under a cap of yeast "flor" so it remains pale. This 
  is the primary type to use for cooking.</li>
<li><b>Manzanilla:</b> &nbsp; This is a very light colored version of 
  Fino Sherry.</li>
<li><b>Manzanilla Pasada:</b> &nbsp; This is Manzanilla aged longer and 
  exposed to oxidation to make it darker and richer.</li>
<li><b>Amontillado:</b> &nbsp; Aged first under yeast "flor", then exposed 
  to oxygen, this wine is darker than Fino but lighter than Oloroso. It is 
  fairly dry but is sometimes sweetened lightly or moderately before 
  bottling. This sherry is often used for cooking where a wine sweeter 
  than Fino is desired.</li>
<li><b>Oloroso:</b> &nbsp; is aged longer than Amontillado and becomes 
  darker, richer and 18% to 20% alcohol. It is fairly dry.</li>
<li><b>Amoroso:</b> &nbsp; A sweetened form of Oloroso.</li>
<li><b>Palo Cortado:</b> &nbsp; A specially aged Amontillado which is darker 
  and more like an Oloroso.</li>
<li><b>Jerez Dulce:</b> &nbsp; Sweet desert sherries made from Pedro 
  Xim&eacute;nez or Muoscatel grapes and often blended with some less sweet 
  sherry. It is rarely used in cooking.</li>
<li><b>Cream Sherry:</b> &nbsp; Popular in England and North America as 
  a sipping sherry, it is a blend of sweet wine from Pedro Xim&eacute;nez 
  grapes and  less sweet wines such as oloroso. It is not often used in 
  cooking.</li>
<li><b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Until recent times sherry that went to vinegar 
  was an embarrassment to the producer, but it is now one of the most 
  prestigious wine vinegars and fetches a good price.</li>
