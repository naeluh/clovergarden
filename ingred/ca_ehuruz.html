[Jamaican Nutmeg; African Nutmeg; Ehu, Ehuru (Igbo); Ariwo (Yoruba); 
  Iwo (Erhe); Awerewa, Ehiri, Airama, Muscadier de Calabash, Lubushi; 
  <i>Monodora myristica</i>]
<p>This member of the Custard Apple family is native to evergreen forests 
of West Africa from Liberia, south to Angola and east to Uganda. It 
is also now grown in the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is present 
in Central and South America. It produces large spherical fruit up to 
nearly 8 inches diameter. Embedded in the aromatic pulp are up to 120 
plump seeds up to 1.0 inches long. These are shelled and the interior 
dried and ground for use in the same ways as nutmeg. They are also used 
medicinally.</p>
<p>The photo specimens are dried shell-on seeds with one broken 
open. they were typically 0.85 x 0.48 inch (2.2 x 1.2 cm).
I found this spice to be nutmeg-like, but less aromatic and 
distinctly more bitter.</p>

<p>In West Africa, this seed is used in Pepper Soup, Goat Stew and 
other dishes, but use elsewhere has declined due to current 
affordability of Nutmeg. In West Africa some people consider Nutmeg 
to be a suitable substitute, and other people do not.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are available on-line in North America. 
The photo specimens were purchased for 2018 US $14.13 per ounce 
($0.50 per gram) plus shipping.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Regular Nutmeg is resonably close, though 
less bitter and more aromatic.<p></p>
