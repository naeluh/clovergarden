  [Grains of Selim, Senegal pepper, Kimba pepper, African pepper,

This spice is totally unrelated to the Pepper Family (Piperaceae) or 
even the Pepper Order (<i>Piperales</i>). It is used for similar 
purposes as those peppers, but is much more aromatic. The tree, growing 
to 70 feet tall, is native to much of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal 
across to Ethiopia, and as far south as Tanzania, with Ghana the largest 
producer of the spice. It is thought to have originated in Ethiopia, 
but is particularly important in Senegal on the coast of West Africa.</p>

<p>In Senegal, most dried Selim Pepper is smoked during the drying to 
give it a deeper flavor. The bark is used medicinally, and the wood is 
valued for many uses.</p>

<p>During Medieval times, this pepper was exported to Europe - until 
the king of Portugal outlawed importing any pepper except black pepper, 
for which he had a monopoly.</p>

<p>A major use in Senegal is crushed and mixed with unroasted coffee 
beans for the coffee drink Caf&eacute; Tuba, for which it is essential. 
The popularity of this drink has been increasing inside and outside 
Senegal. It is also used in meat stews, soups, and ground for use in 
rubs for meat and fish.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You are highly unlikely to find this in 
the spice section of your local supermarket, but it is available 
on-line from a few sources. The photo specimens were purchased from 
a spice store in San Francisco for 2018 US $6.69 for a 4 ounce jar 
(plus shipping).<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  These are used in two ways, whole and powdered. 
To use whole, lightly crush them. Remove them at serving time. Powdered, 
split them open and remove the seeds, which can be quite bitter, then 
toast them lightly and grind to powder in your spice grinder.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The standard recommendation is 1/2 Cubeb Pepper 
and 1/2 grated Nutmeg. If you don't have Cubeb Pepper, then regular 
Black Pepper. From the smell, I suspect Cinnamon might be even 
closer than Nutmeg.<p></p>
