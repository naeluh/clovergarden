<h1>Soursop</h1>

[Guanabana (Spanish); Graviola (Brazil); <i>Annona muricata</i>]
<p>
Native to the West Indies, soursop is now the most grown Annona 
throughout the tropics.  The fruits are relatively large, up to 12 inches 
long and 6 inches in diameter, thin skinned and covered with tiny spines 
which rub off easily. The larger photo specimen was 6 inches long, 3-3/4 
inches diameter and weighed 6-3/4 ounces.</p>
<p>Most soursop is processed into ice cream, sherbets and beverages. The 
flesh is a trace fibrous and there are a lot of seeds, but the flavor is 
intensely floral and quite enjoyable. It has been described as like 
Strawberry and Pineapple with notes of Citrus and Coconut or Banana. 
The fruit has a sweet-sour balance similar to Tamarind.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Soursops have just started to appear 
in markets in Southern California, but at a very steep price. The 
photo specimens were purchased for 2016 US $11.99 / pound. I have 
also bought whole frozen soursops from the feezer cases of a large 
Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) but they are not as 
pleasant as the fresh ones. I have also purchased Soursop canned in 
syrup which was quite nice, but I haven't seen it for years.<p></p>

<h3>Ripening:</h3> &nbsp; If they are hard, they can be set out on 
a counter for a few days. They are ripe when they have just a little 
give, similar to a green Avocado. They can be eaten with a spoon.

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Vitamins:</h3> &nbsp; Soursop has significant amounts of 
Vitamins C, B1 and B2, and Minerals Magnesium, Phosphorus and 
Potassium.<p></p>

<h3>Neurotoxin:</h3> &nbsp; Soursop seeds contain Annonacin, a 
degenerative neurotoxin which produces a form of Parkinsons disease. 
It is still unknown if the flesh contains annonacin sufficient to be a 
problem for people who consume soursop regularly. Further study is 
indicated.<p></p>
   
<h3>Cancer:</h3> &nbsp; "Health Food" businesses are selling Soursop 
capsules under the name "Graviola" as a cure for cancer. There isn't 
the slightest trace of any scientific or medical evidence that Graviola 
capsules have any anti-cancer activity (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center, Cancer Research UK, U.S. Federal Trade Commission). On the other 
hand, no large scale human trials have been performed, so the claims 
have not been rigorously disproven, however unlikely they may be.
<p></p>

<h3>Seed Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Soursop seed oil has traditionally been used 
for many medicinal purposes, and is used in lotions to relieve various 
skin disorders.<p></p>
