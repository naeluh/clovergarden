<h1>Arugula / Rocket</h1>
<br><img src="img/hb_arug08f.jpg" alt="Arugula Leaves" class=mrg>
[Arugula (North America, Australia); Rocket (England); Oruga, Arugula, 
  Rucula (Spanish); Rucola, Ruchetta (Italian); Roquette (French); 
  <i>Eruca sativa</i> (mustard family)]
<p>
This popular salad green of Mediterranean origin has been used since 
at least Roman times. Almost unknown in the U.S. a decade ago it is today 
the "must have" green for yuppie salads, so supermarkets stock pre-cut and 
washed bags of "baby" arugula. The leaves are small and tender 
but have a distinctly mustardy bite, backed by an unusually complex 
flavor.</p>
<p>Some varieties have leaves less deeply cut than the photo specimen and 
the leaves are very deeply cut on the wild version. In Italy Arugula is 
used in soups, but cooked it looses almost all its flavor. The term 
"Rocket" is also loosely used for a number of other peppery herbs.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is now common in markets and farmers 
markets serving the yuppie class, and also in many supermarkets in 
reasonably affluent neighborhoods. &nbsp; <u>Note:</u> &nbsp; The 
largest and most beautiful Arugula I have seen I purchased from Whole 
Foods Market in Glendale CA. It was all but unusable, totally lacking 
in flavor or any redeeming cultural value.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Refrigerate loosely wrapped. This is a very 
perishable herb and will start to turn yellow in just a couple of days.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Don't - use it raw in salads - it looses nearly 
all flavor and becomes mushy when cooked (though some ethnic recipes do 
call for it cooked).<p></p>
