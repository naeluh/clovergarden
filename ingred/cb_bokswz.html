<h1>Sweet Bok Choy</h1>
<br><img src="img/cb_bkswt02g.jpg" alt="Leafy Sweet Choy Stems" class=mrg>
[Sweet Pak Choy; <i>Brassica rapa</i> Group <i>Chinensis</i>]
<p>
This is a tender bok choy with light green to slightly yellow-green 
leaves. The stems, which are white like regular Bok Choy, are relatively 
thin, so giving them a head start over the greens is optional. The largest 
leaf from the photo specimens was 11 inches long by 7 inches wide.</p>

<p>Cooking time needs to be very short - but, in my opinon, they would 
do just fine raw in salads. Of course that wouldn't be authentically 
Chinese - the Chinese traditionally don't eat raw vegetables due to 
unsanitary growing methods. On the other hand, Sweet Bok Choy isn't a 
tradigional Chinese vegetable anyway - and what I can get is grown in 
"over regulated" California where traditional Chinese growing methods 
are strictly banned.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This green has just started to appear (2-2019). 
The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $0.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Store in the refrigerator loosely bagged in 
plastic and use as soon as possible - The leaves start to yellow 
rather quickly, with a decline in appearance and texture.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Separating the stems from the leaves is optional, 
as the stems are quite thin and the timing difference won't be a whole '
lot.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These greens are used in soups and stir fries 
pretty much the same as regular Bok Choy, but keep the cooking time 
shorter. In a stir fry, the taste effect is a bit sweeter than regular 
Bok Choy, and it wouldn't hurt to use a little more of it than the 
recipe calls for.
