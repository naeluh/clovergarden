<h1>Shanghai Bok Choy / Green Bok Choy</h1>
<p>Bok Choy is not a cabbage, it is turnip greens. All versions feature 
a sharper flavor with thicker, crisper stems than 
<a href="cb_napaz.html">Napa Cabbage</a> (also a turnip green). The 
<a href="cb_bokz.html">White Stemmed</a> varieties are very popular 
in stir fries and soups, while Shanghai Bok Choy is often steamed whole 
or split lengthwise. Bok choy does not form tight heads but the clusters 
of stems form a tight bundle</p>

<p>
This Turnip Green is probably the most popular vegetable in the Shanghai 
region (Zhejiang), and is now widely available in North American 
produce and supermarkets. It's smaller than the white stemmed bok choy 
they sell, so supermarkets, always anxious to snag the yuppie dollar, 
call it "baby bok choy". Hey, yuppies buy "baby carrots" (machine made 
from large carrots) and bags of bland "baby spinach", so "baby" anything 
should sell, right?</p>
<p>The flavor of this bok choy is distinctly different from that of 
the white stemmed variety. Besides being light green, the leaf stems are 
much thinner and more tender. This variety is better suited to steam 
whole or split lengthwise as the stems cook almost as quickly as the 
greens.

<h2>Shanghai Bok Choy Mui</h2>

<p>
This is the "Mui" form of the Shanghai Bok Choy described above. 
It is becoming much more available in the Asian markets, and is very 
popular in southern China, especially for cooking whole. It is not a 
"baby" plant, but a dwarf variety that is fully mature and may have 
flower buds. The photo specimens were sold as <i>Sin Choy Mui</i> by 
a market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) that uses a mix of Chinese and 
Vietnamese names. These were up to 5-1/2 inches long and average weight 
was 0.66 ounces each.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Most North American produce and supermarkets 
now carry the full size Shanghai Bok Choy as "Baby Bok Choy". The "Mui" 
version can be found only in Asian markets. See that the heads are 
firm and the leaves are not yellowing, spotted or off color. Such 
leaves must be discarded, but once it starts, yellowing wil proceed 
rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped in plastic and refrigerated, 
they will keep several days and then start to turn yellow. Yellowing 
leaves have lost their flavor.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Shanghai Bok Choy, if not too large, is often 
steamed whole or split lengthwise, usually by steaming. Since the stems 
quite tender they don't need to be cooked separately. It can also be 
used in stir fries and other recipes the same way as the white stemmed, 
but give the stems less lead time over the leaves, if any. For any 
method, do not overcook.<p></p>

<h2>Health and Nutrition</h2> &nbsp; Bok Choys are considered a very 
healthy, nutritious green, and suspected of anti-cancer properties 
due to containing Glucosinolate. Due to the glucosinolate, Bok Choy 
can be toxic to people already seriously ill - but it takes about 2 
to 3 pounds a day, every day, to be dangerous.<p></p>
