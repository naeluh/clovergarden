[Taiwan Pak Choy; <i>Brassica rapa</i> Group <i>Chinensis</i>]
<p>
A very tender bok choy with light green to slightly yellowish leaves. The 
   stems, which are whiter than those of Shanghai bok choy, are almost as 
   tender as the leaves - it's almost like lettuce. I understand it was 
   recently developed in Taiwan and has just started appearing in markets 
   here. The photo specimens were bought from an Asian market in Los Angeles 
   in a 1 pound 5 ounce bag.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This green is still not common, even in the Asian 
markets in Los Angeles, but it does appear now and then.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Store in the refrigerator loosely bagged in 
plastic and use as soon as possible - The leaves start to spot  
immediately and appearance will degrade rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; It is not necessary to separate the stems from the 
leaves as they are both rather tender.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These greens are used in soups and stir fries. 
Cooking time should be minimum, just enough to wilt the leaves and stems.
