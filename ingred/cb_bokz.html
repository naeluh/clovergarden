<p>
Bok Choy is not a cabbage but turnip greens. All versions feature a 
sharper flavor with thicker, crisper stems than <a href="cb_napaz.html">
Napa Cabbage</a> (also a turnip green). The white stemmed varieties are 
very popular in stir fries and soups, the green stemmed 
<a href="cb_boksz.html">Shanghai Bok Choy</a> is often steamed. 
Bok choy does not form tight heads but the clusters of stems form a 
tight bundle</p>

<h2>Bok Choy, Large</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_bokbig02g.jpg" alt="Large Bok Choy stems and leaves" class=mrg>
This large form is now widely available in North American produce markets 
and even many supermarkets. This vegetable is the "cabbage" of 
southern China, while <a href="cb_napaz.html">Napa Cabbage</a> (also a 
turnip green) takes its place in the north. It is available in a variety 
of sizes, but the photo specimen was 14-1/2 inches long and weighed just 
over 3 pounds.

<h2>Bok Choy Mui</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_bokchoytiny04d.jpg" alt="Tiny Bok Choy heads" class=mrg>
This is the "real" baby bok choy, one of my favorite vegetables for 
stir fries and such, but it's not widely available outside markets 
serving Asian communities. It is not really "baby", it's a tiny variety, 
as witnessed by the mature flower heads you will find on it. There are 
actually a number of miniature cultivars, some smaller, some larger.  
Taste is similar to full size bok choy but the distribution of stem 
and leaf is more pleasing in my opinion - more leaf.

<p><b>Prep:</b> &nbsp; The main problem with this form is getting all 
the grit washed out. I usually strip the biggest stems off, then split 
the remaining head in half lengthwise which makes it easier to fluff the 
leaves and wash it.

<h2>Long Bok Choy</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_bokchoylong01d.jpg" alt="Long Bok Choy heads" class=mrg>
This cultivar is longer and narrower than a regular mid-size bok 
choy, but it tastes the same and can be used in exactly the same way. 
It does have the advantage that the stems are less bulky, thus need 
less lead time over the leaves when cooking and the texture of the 
dish will be less coarse. It frequently shows up in Asian markets in 
Los Angeles, but probably not much elsewhere yet.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The large white stemmed Bok Choy can be found 
in most North American produce and supermarkets. The other forms shown 
above will only be available in markets serving an Asian community. 
Look for firm heads with bright green leaves and without soft spots 
or discoloration on the white leaf stems.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; All forms of bok choy should be loosely wrapped 
and refrigerated. They will keep several days and then start to turn 
yellow. Yellowing leaves have lost their flavor and must be discarded.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The White stemmed Bok Choy is often used in 
stir fries and soups. It is usually best to cut or tear the green leaves 
away from the white stems and into the desired size. Slice the stems 
diagonally crosswise to the width desired. The larger the stem the 
narrower the width should be. Keep the stems and leaves separate.

<p>When cooking, give the stems a lead of 1 to 4 minutes depending on size 
and method. For stir fries, the leaves should be stirred in just enough to 
be coated with oil, then the liquid ingredients are added. Cover and simmer 
until the stem slices are crisp tender. Do not overcook.</p>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2> &nbsp; Bok choys are 
considered a very healthy, nutritious greens, and suspected of 
anti-cancer properties due to containing Glucosinolate. Due to the 
glucosinolate, Bok Choy can be toxic to people already seriously ill - 
but it takes about 2 to 3 pounds a day, every day, to be dangerous.
