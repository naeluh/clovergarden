While it looks a lot like Italian Rapini, Chinese Broccoli is related 
to European broccoli and cabbages while Rapini is a turnip green related 
to most other Asian greens. It is different in form from European broccoli 
having thinner more tender stems, tiny flower heads and a lot of large 
leaves.</p>
<p>The stems are always used and the white flowers do not become 
bitter so are also included with the rest of the plant when 
cooking. This is a  very important vegetable in the cooking of China and 
Southeast Asia, so it is commonly available in markets serving those 
communities.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find Gai Lan in markets serving an East or Southeast 
Asian community, and in farmer's markets that include one or more Asian 
vegetable growers. Look for fresh looking leaves and avoid bunches were the 
larger leaves are starting to show spots. Flower heads are fine even if 
a few of the white flowers are starting to open.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Store in the refrigerator loosely bagged in 
plastic and use within a couple of days - once you see spotting on the 
outer leaves flavor and appearance degrade rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Separate the leaves and tender tips from the stalks, 
including the leaf stems which can be tougher than the main stalks. Slice 
stalks on a shallow diagonal ("horse ears" in Chinese terminology) starting 
about 1/2 inch at the big end and increasing to about 1-1/4 inches at the 
thin end. Cut or tear leaves into pieces roughly 1-1/2 to 2 inches on a side. 
Keep separate.
<p>Another method is to split the large stems in half and cut to lengths 
or 1-1/2 inches or so.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable is most commonly steamed or 
stir fried, then simmered. Wherever possible give the stalks about 3 to 
4 minutes lead over the leaves. The leaves should end up uniformly wilted 
and the stalks should be just crisp tender, the larger pieces still a bit 
crunchy.
<p>Many Asian recipes have you steam whole Gai Lan and make a sauce to 
pour over it. These recipes depend on Gai Lan that's small, young and 
tender. Most Gai Lan sold here in Southern California (and most elsewhere 
in North America probably comes from here) is harvested much larger so is 
better steamed cut as described above.</p>
