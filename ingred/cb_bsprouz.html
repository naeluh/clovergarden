[<i>B. oleracea</i> Group <i>Gemmifera</i>]
<p>
This cabbage grows a large fibrous central stem with large collard-like 
leaves radiating from it. When those leaves become old they yellow and 
fall off, and are replaced not by new leaves but by small cabbage heads 
radiating out from the main stem just above the leaf scar. Cabbages of this 
type may have been known in Roman times, but they first became a major crop 
in Belgium around 1590.</p>
<p>These cabbages have long been voted "most hated vegetable" in England, 
but even there they are becoming more popular as the English slowly learn 
to cook. The photo specimen stem was 20 inches long and weighed 3 pounds 
11 ounces. Individual heads were up to 1-3/4 inches diameter.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Brussels Sprouts are sold in most markets and 
supermarkets, usually as loose heads. Here in California, where most of 
them are grown, farmer's and produce markets also often sell them by the 
stem when they are in peak season (late Winter through Spring). Look at 
the base end, the head should be fairly tight and hard, not stemmy, and 
there should be a minimum of yellowed leaves, though there will usually 
be some.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Brussels Sprouts are usually not a grit problem, 
but wash them well by submerging them in cold water because there's often 
a bug or two among the stems at the base end. Remove loose or yellowed 
outer leaves and trim the stem close to the remaining leaves. For some 
recipes you may cut them in half or quarters lengthwise, never crosswise. 
For whole sprouts, some cooks cut a cross in the bottom of the stem so it will 
cook faster with less risk of overcooking the leaves.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Never</u>, <u>Never</u> cook Brussels 
Sprouts "English Style" (boiled to death). Preferably steam them, but 
you can also simmer them - just until barely tender - <u>never</u> 
<u>more</u> (quoth the raven). This is more controllable if they are 
cut in half or quarters lengthwise (depending on size) before cooking, 
and they cook faster.
<p>They are also often split in half or quarters, lightly oiled and 
roasted until just tender. The grower of the stem shown in the top 
photo provided instructions for charcoal grilling the whole stem.</p>
