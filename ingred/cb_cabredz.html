Red cabbages are very similar to the white except for the red coloration 
from Anthocyanin pigments. Color may vary from red to blue depending on 
acidity of the soil the cabbage grew in. This red pigment is a 
powerful antioxidant, the same one found in red wine. Red cabbage has 
been popular in Northern Europe because it keeps better than white 
cabbage so doesn't need to be made into sauerkraut to get through the 
winter. Some writers say red cabbage tastes exactly like white but that 
isn't quite true. The flavor is slightly less sweet and more complex.

This cabbage was the original source of the Anthocyanin dye used to make 
Litmus Paper, familiar to anyone who's had high school chemistry. It turns 
blue when exposed to alkalis and red when exposed to acids. This is the 
source of the term "litmus test" used in politics.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You'd be hard pressed to find a supermarket or 
produce market in North America that didn't have red cabbage along with the 
white. Look for firm heads heavy for their size.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Wrap loosely in plastic and it'll keep in the 
refrigerator for a couple of months, though some of the outer leaves will 
wilt.<p></p>
