<p>
This is the standard Euro/American cabbage, and the one European 
sauerkraut is made from (Asian sauerkraut is made from Napa type 
cabbages - actually turnip greens). Many cultivars are grown but 
they all look exactly the same in the store. All the big loose outer 
leaves are removed at the farm and the last semi-loose ones are 
removed at the store, leaving just a pale green ball of immature 
leaves. The photo specimen was a typical market size at 6 inches 
diameter and 2 pounds, but heads grown for sauerkraut can weigh up to 
60 pounds.</p>
<p>Heading cabbages are not found in nature. Development of these 
cabages by selective breeding began during the Roman Empire.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You'd be hard pressed to find a supermarket or 
produce market in North America that didn't have white cabbage. Look for 
firm heads heavy for their size. Light weight and yellowed outer leaves are 
signs it's been hanging around for a while.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Wrap loosely in plastic and it'll keep in the 
refrigerator for more than a month, though some of the outer leaves will 
wilt or yellow.
