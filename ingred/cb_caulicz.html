<p>
This is probably pretty much what European cauliflower looked like in 
the time of the Roman Empire. Selective breeding during Medieval and 
Renaissance times developed the heavy white curd cauliflower we enjoy 
today. The photo specimen is a particularly fine specimen, whiter and 
with less stem showing than many. When they first appeared, in 2017, 
they were greener and more disorderly, so selection has been in effect.
</p>

<p>The taste of this vegetable is very much that of cauliflower, but 
"greener" and sweeter than our regular Western cauliflower - less 
of a blank canvas and more of a feature flavor. Raw, it sometimes has 
a little bitterness, but not objectionably so, and the bitterness fades 
with cooking. The photo specimen was a head 11-1/2 inches across and 
weighing 24 ounces.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable is now grown in California and 
becoming fairly common in the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. 
It appears to be quite popular with the Asian community. The photo 
specimen was bought in mid February from a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2020 US $1.99 / pound, but I have bought it 
at $1.59 / pound later in the year.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; If it is in good condition, it will hold for 
4 or 5 days refrigerated loosely wrapped in plastic.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable can be used raw in salads, 
but is more often cooked. Steaming, simmering, and stir frying are 
suitable methods. Do not overcook, the green stems should still have 
a little crunchiness to them.<p></p>
