<p>
This cabbage, closely related to Kale, may have originated in Western 
Asia, but was well known and cultivated by the ancient Greeks and Romans. 
Either the Romans or the Celts carried it as far north as Scotland. Scots 
took it to the American South where it was adopted by slaves because it 
was easy to grow and could be used similarly to African greens they were 
accustomed to cooking.</p>

<p><b>Confusion:</b> &nbsp; "Collard Greens" are much used in Africa 
today, but they are not the Collard Greens of North America. East 
African agricultural articles always call them "Kales". The North 
American variety is very tough and needs long cooking time (they have 
to be tough to grow in Scotland).  Knowledgeable African recipes 
always call for using Kale in place of African "Collard Greens" 
(Sukuma wiki in Swahili). For details see 
<a href="cb_kalez.html"><b>Kale</b></a>.</p>

<p>Collards are also a popular side dish for fish and meat in Portugal 
and Brazil. These are from the Mediterranean region, so again, 
not generally as tough as our Scottish variety - obvious from cooking 
times in recipes. Use Kale instead of American Collards</p> 
   
<p>Collards are rather indigestible raw, but are very nutritious 
when cooked until tender. Along with the related Kale, they are 
rated to have the most nutrition per calorie of all vegetables. 
Because they are tough, they are often shredded fine for cooking. 
The photo specimens were up to 15 inches long.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Collard greens are still very popular in the 
US Southeast, and are available in most groceries throughout the USA. 
Look for intact blue-green leaves without yellow or other discolorations. 
There are likely to be a few holes in the leaves made by cabbage worms - 
ignore them, they just show that pesticides were not overused.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp;  Loosely wrapped, Collards will keep in the 
refrigerator for about 3 days, but will soon start to yellow and lose 
their vitamin content.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Collards are tough and can take rather long to 
cook, so they are often shredded fine. Remove the stems. Stack a couple 
of the leaf halves and roll them up as tight as you can from end to end, 
then slice the rolls crosswise very thin. The stems can be included in 
soup or stock for flavor and removed before finishing. In some cases 
larger leaf stems are peeled to remove fibers and cut into very 
short pieces included with the leaves for added texture.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Portugal and Brazil, Collards are very 
popular just shredded very fine, fried with Olive Oil or Butter, and 
served as a side dish. This does not work well with American Collards, 
which are tougher, so use Kale for Mediterranean recipes In the American 
Southeast collard recipes are most often soups or stews, and may be 
cooked for 55 minutes to 2 hours, or even more.<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Collards have 
much the same nutrition as Kale, considered one of the highest of all 
vegetables for nutrition per calorie. Collards are very high in Beta 
Carotene, Vitamin K, manganese and Vitamin C. They are also high in 
Fiber, Calcium, Choline, Vitamins B2 and B6, Iron, Copper, Vitamin E, 
and magnesium.

<p>When Collards are chopped or chewed, enzymes produce Sulforaphane 
which is considered a potent anti-cancer substance, and also helps 
with diabetes. It is antimicrobial, and also thought to help inhibit 
heart inflammation.</p>

<p>Persons taking warfarin or other anti-coagulants are cautioned 
against eating Collards due to its high vitamin K content.</p>
