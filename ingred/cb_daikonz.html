<h1>Daikon Radish</h1>

[<i>Raphanus Sativus</i>]
<p>
Essential to Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisines, these large white radishes 
are now available throughout the U.S. even in regular supermarkets. Asian 
markets may have several shapes and will also carry both roots and leaves in 
various dried, pickled and salted forms. Most markets remove the leaves 
because they yellow quickly but some farmer's markets will have them with 
leaves on.</p>
<p>These are fairly mild radishes, generally similar to a very mild red 
radish. Most Japanese daikons are shaped like fat carrots and are 
marketed in various sizes from a few ounces to several pounds, but in 
Japan spherical varieties are also grown. Korean daikons are fatter and 
shorter, often quite cylindrical. The photo specimens are: Korean, 4-3/4 
inches diameter, 7 inches long and 3-1/4 pounds, about average size, and  
Japanese, 2-1/4 inches diameter, 12 inches long and 1-1/2 pounds, again 
about average.

<p>One of the least aware recipes I've seen asks for "1/2 daikon radish". 
In Southern California I can easily find daikons ranging from less than 
5 ounces to well over 5 pounds - from 6 inches to 2 feet long - long thin 
daikons and short fat daikons. So just exactly how big is "half a 
#&amp;)*# daikon radish" in England, lady? This behavior is typical of 
cookbooks from England, where apparently they have neither scales or 
rulers, and where all fruits, vegetables and bunches of herbs must be of 
uniform size, and probably a lot smaller than in Californai.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Look for nice white color and, unless 
you will be grating them or slicing very thin, look for small size. Large 
daikons tend to be fibrous which is hardly noticeable raw, but 
unpleasant in stews and soups. In particular watch for hints of gray or 
blue color, especially around the root fibers. This sort of 
discoloration will be shot all through the radish making it ugly and 
unusable.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Wrapped loosely and stored in the refrigerator 
daikons will last at least a couple of weeks.<p></p>

<h2>Radish Sprouts</h2>

These are easy to find here in Southern California, and are always 
from Daikon radishes because their sprouts are large and fast growing. 
They are particularly popular in vegetarian sandwiches and salads, 
where their sharp radishy bite helps liven up the mix. They are 
generally packaged in a tall flimsy plastic container with growing 
matrix in the bottom. The photo specimen was 5 inches high (including 
matrix and roots) and weighed 5-3/8 ounces with a 2-1/2 ounce edible 
yield.
