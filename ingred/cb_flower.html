<h1>Cabbage Flowers <small>&amp;</small> Pods</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>Development of cabbages (<i>Brassicaceae</i> (formerly 
<i>Cruciferae</i>)) with large heads of flowers was by Italian farmers, 
broccoli probably from Roman times and Cauliflower during the Renaissance. 
Today they are grown through much of the temperate world, with 
cauliflower particularly favored in India.</p>

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Most cabbages have small clusters of flowers on tall spindly or 
fleshy stems, but plant breeders, starting in Roman times, have coaxed 
some into producing huge densely packed flower heads which are highly 
edible when immature. If they are allowed to mature and the flowers open 
they become bitter. The flowers in the main head are sterile, but once 
the big head is cut, if the plant is left to mature, the stem will 
sprout small flower heads that are fertile and produce seeds, used to 
grow the next generation.
</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Radish Seed Pods</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_mogri02d.jpg" alt="Seed Pods" class=mrg>
[Mogri (India); <i>Raphanus sativa</i>]
<p>
Special varieties of radish are grown for their seed pods rather than 
their roots, particularly in India and Germany. These may be eaten 
either cooked or raw. In India they are usually cooked as a lightly 
spicy vegetable. In Germany they are often served in salads or as an 
accompaniment for beer. The European rat-tailed radish grows pods up 
to 8 inches long, but the photo specimens were from an Indian market 
in Los Angeles, and the longest was about 3 inches long and 0.310 inch 
diameter.

<h2>Broccoli, Calabrese</h2>
<br><a href="cb_broccz.html">
<img src="img/cb_broc05d.jpg" alt="Whole Head of Calabrese Broccoli" class=mrg></a>
[Broccoli; Br&oacute;colis americano (Brazil); Xi Nan Hua Cai (China, 
lit. Flower Vegetable from the Southwest); <i>B. Brassica oleracea</i> 
Group <i>Italica</i>]
<p>
Broccoli was probably known in Roman times, though it probably looked 
much more like the Heirloom Broccoli (next down). It continued to 
be developed by growers to produce the large flower heads we know today. 
These heads are harvested and eaten well before maturity because they 
will open into yellow flowers and become mushy and bitter. Broccoli 
stems are also quite edible, though older and tougher ones may need to 
be peeled, and leaves are edible too. Like other cabbages, broccoli is 
high in fiber, vitamin C, antioxidants and is suspected of significant 
anticancer benefits. The photo specimens were about 5-1/2 inches 
across, 5-1/2 inches long and weighed 13 ounces. Broccoli is often 
sold in narrower heads and/or with longer stems. &nbsp;

<h2>Broccoli, Calabrese - Heirloom</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_calabh02d.jpg" alt="Leafy Broccoli Stems" class=mrg>
[<i>B. Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Italica</i>]
<p>
This leafy, small headed variety is probably similar to those known in 
Roman times. The stems are thin and quite tender so the whole bunch 
can be used. These were purchased from a specialty grower in Southern 
California who does a lot of business in greens.</p>
<p>Actually, with some heading heirloom types, once the central head is 
harvested, the plants are knocked down. They then send up plenty of side 
sprouts similar to these. The side sprouts are generally enjoyed by the 
growers and do not reach the markets.

<h2>Baby Broccoli</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cb_broccolini02d.jpg" alt="Bunch of Baby Broccoli" class=mrg>
[#3277 Aspiration<small><sup>tm</sup></small>, 
Brocolini<small><sup>tm</sup></small>, Sweet Baby Broccoli<small><sup>
tm</sup></small>, Tenderstem<small><sup>tm</sup></small> Broccoli,
Aspabroc<small><sup>tm</sup></small>, Br&oacute;colis (Brazil); 
<i>Brassica oleracea</i>, <i>Italica</i> Group x <i>Alboglabra</i> Group]
<p>
This is a hybrid between Chinese Broccoli and regular Calabrese 
broccoli. It was produced by the Sakata Seed Company of Yokohama, Japan, 
under the name "Aspabroc". It is now marketed under a number of 
trademarked names. Oddly, in Brazil this is the normal broccoli, with 
our regular Calabrese broccoli called br&oacute;colis americano and 
sold at a higher price.</p>
<p>This broccoli can now be found in most well stocked supermarkets in 
North America, sold in bunches of less than 1/2 pound at yuppified 
prices (around 2012 US $7.00 per pound - yuppies will pay the big bucks 
for anything labeled "baby"). It can easily be told from other 
thin stemmed varieties by it's almost total lack of leaves. The stems 
are reasonably tender and edible. This is a characteristic of Chinese 
broccoli, but this hybrid has larger flower heads and is 
less leafy. Being a hybrid of broccoli x broccoli, it tastes pretty 
much like broccoli, but I'm sticking with regular broccoli and Chinese 
broccoli, both of which I can buy for well under 2014 US $1.00 per 
pound. (Update) One of my usual multi-ethnic markets has started  
selling this as "Brocolini" at a more reasonable 2014 US $1.33 per pound.

<h2>Broccoli, Chinese</h2>
<br><a href="cb_brocccz.html">
<img src="img/cb_chbroc10m.jpg" alt="Bunch of Chinese Broccoli" class=mrg></a> 
- see <a href="cb_brocccz.html"><b>Chinese Broccoli</b></a>. This is 
the only one of the Asian greens that is actually a broccoli - all the 
rest are turnip greens. In any case, it is used more as leafy greens 
so it is on the Greens page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Broccoli Rabe</h2>
<br><a href="cb_green.html#rapi">
<img src="img/cb_rappini08m.jpg" alt="Bunch of Rappini" class=mrg></a>
 - see <a href="cb_green.html#rapi"><b>Rappini</b></a>. This 
"broccoli", which is actually a turnip green, is used more as leafy 
greens, so it is on our Greens page.

<h2 id="brocci">Brocciflower</h2>
<br>[<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group ????] &nbsp; 
In appearance similar to <a href="cb_flower.html#brocco">Broccoflower</a>, this is 
an artificial, genetically engineered cross between sexually incompatible 
Cauliflower and Broccoli. Denounced as "Frankenfood" it has not been 
really commercially successful but is still found in supermarkets now 
and then. If you are concerned, check the spelling - "o" is OK.<p></p>

<h2 id="brocco">Broccoflower</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cb_brocco05h.jpg" alt="Whole Head of Broccoflower" class=mrg>
[<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Botrytis</i>??]
<p>
Is it a cauliflower or a broccoli? It's origin is uncertain so plant 
geneticists aren't sure. One thing is certain, it's not a cross between a 
cauliflower and a broccoli because the two are sexually incompatible (see 
<a href="cb_flower.html#brocci">Brocciflower</a>). The "curd" is medium green, a bit 
looser than regular cauliflower and it's a bit stemmier. The photo 
specimen was 6 inches across and weighed 1 pound 4-1/2 ounces. Without 
leaves and their stems it weighed 13 ounces (63% yield). Taste is 
considered somewhat lighter and sweeter than regular cauliflower but 
it's also much easier to overcook.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cauliflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_cauli12d.jpg" alt="White and Orange heads of Cauliflower" class=mrg>
[<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Botrytis</i>]<p>
This cabbage grows a huge cluster of flower buds that never mature. Called 
the "curd", this cluster may be white, lime green or orange depending on 
variety and how it's grown. For white varieties, leaves are tied over the 
curd to protect it from the sun so it will remain white and mild in flavor. 
The orange variety is actually a cross between a wild swamp growing mutant 
found in Canada and a regular white cauliflower - it has many times the 
vitamin A content of white cauliflower.</p>
<p>While cauliflower curd is sterile and will never produce seeds, a 
plant left to grow after the big flower head is cut will eventually 
develop side branches with viable flowers and seeds, which is how 
cauliflower is propagated. Cauliflower leaves are used in some cuisines, 
but are never available in North American supermarkets or even farmer's 
markets, at least not around here.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chinese Taishan Cauliflower</h2>; 
<br><a href="cb_caulicz.html">
<img src="img/cb_caulic10h.jpg" alt="Head of Chinese Cauliflower" class=mrg></a>
<p>[<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Botrytis</i> ??]
</p><p>
This is probably pretty much what European cauliflower looked like in 
the time of the Roman Empire. Selective breeding during Medieval and 
Renaissance times developed the heavy, pure white curd cauliflower we 
enjoy today.</p>
<p>The taste of this vegetable is very much that of cauliflower, but 
the flavor is "greener" and sweeter than our regular Western cauliflower 
- less of a blank canvas and more of a feature flavor. Raw, it can have 
just a touch of bitterness, but not objectionably so, and the bitterness 
fades with cooking.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Purple Cauliflower</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cb_caulipurp01e.jpg" alt="Purple Cauliflower" class=mrg>
[<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Italica</i>]
<p>
It looks like a cauliflower but the ISHS says it's a broccoli (see 
under <a href="cb_flower.html#roman">Romanesco</a>). In any case it's got a case of 
anthocyaninpigments, an antioxidant found also in red cabbage and red 
wine.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Romanesco Cauliflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_roman24e.jpg" alt="Romanesco" class=mrg>
[Fractal Broccoli; Chou Romanesco (French); Broccolo romanesco, 
Cavolo romanesco (Italian); Pyramidenblumenkohl(German); 
<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Botrytis</i>]
<p>
This flowering cabbage is a stunning example of how nature encodes 
large amounts of genetic information in a mathematical form called 
fractals. The head is a cone, made up of spirals of smaller but 
otherwise identical spiral cones, which are in turn made up of smaller 
spiral cones, ad infinitum. Actually all cauliflowers are built pretty 
much this way, it just isn't so clear and orderly.</p>

<p>Although first reported from Italy in the 16th century, acceptance of 
this variety has been held back by a fierce dispute as to whether it is 
a broccoli or a cauliflower - but now the ISHS (International Society for 
Horticultural Science) has declared from extensive analysis that it is 
Cauliflower. So there, now you can eat it, if you can afford it - but 
take care, it reacts very poorly to over-cooking. Steam until just tender.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Both broccoli and cauliflower are considered highly nutritious and 
packed with vitamins, minerals, and a very high antioxidant content. They 
are considered to offer some of the most effective anti-cancer benefits 
known.</p>
