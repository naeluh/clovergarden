<hr class=hr2>
<p>
In northern climates Cabbages, Mustards and Turnips have provided 
the only green vegetables available in the winter months. Some, 
like red cabbage, keep well fresh while others have been pickled and 
preserved in various ways. Their pungency, flavor and nutritional value 
has, and still does, relieve the bland starchiness of winter root 
vegetables.

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Cabbages, Mustards, Turnips and Radishes (to the botanist they're all 
"Mustards") are native to Europe and Asia. Because they were so important 
to diet and survival they have been bred for desirable features since 
prehistoric times. While some were bred for roots and others for flower 
heads, leaves were not neglected either. All these plants are naturally 
loose leafed, but "heading" cabbages had already been developed in 
Mediterranean Europe during Roman times.</p>


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>All the cabbages, mustards and turnips important as edible greens 
belong to the genus <i>Brassica</i> of family <i>Brassicaceae</i>. 
Despite their diversity of appearance they belong to just a few species, 
though each species may have many very different agriculturally developed 
cultivars. The exception is the Rutabaga which is a cross between a 
cabbage and a turnip (Rutabaga leaves are edible but I've never seen 
them sold).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>B. oleracea</b> - Cabbages, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Kale, Brussels Sprouts.</li>
<li><b>B. rapa</b> - Turnips, Chinese cabbages. Rapini</li>
<li><b>B. juncea</b> - Mustard Greens.</li>
<li><b>B. napus</b> - Rape (source of canola oil)</li>
<li><b>B. sativus</b> - Radishes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=cabh class=lrg>Head Cabbages</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <h3>Oleracea Species</h3>
 
<p>Heading Cabbages [<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Groups <i>capitata</i> and 
<i>Gemmifera</i>] include two major cultivars: <i>alba</i> (white) and 
<i>rubra</i> (red), but there are numerous varieties of each. 
Categorization is not always clear - for instance, there's a continuum of 
varieties from white cabbage to savoy cabbage.</p>

   <h2>Brussels Sprouts</h2>
   <br><a href="cb_bsprouz.html">
   <img src="img/cb_bsprout12f.jpg" alt="Long Stem of Brussels Sprouts" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>B. oleracea</i> Group <i>Gemmifera</i>]
   <p>
   This cabbage grows a large fibrous central stem with large collard-like 
   leaves radiating from it. When those leaves become old they yellow and 
   fall off, and are replaced not by new leaves but by small cabbage heads 
   radiating out from the main stem just above the leaf scar. Cabbages of 
   this type may have been known in Roman times, but they first became a 
   major crop in Belgium around 1590.</p>
   <p>These cabbages have long been voted "most hated vegetable" in 
   England, but even there they are becoming more popular as the English 
   slowly learn to cook. The photo specimen stem was 20 inches long and 
   weighed 3 pounds 11 ounces. Individual heads were up to 1-3/4 inches 
   diameter. Yield was 61 heads weighing 2 pounds 14 ounces (78%).

   <h2>Flathead Cabbage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cb_flathead02h.jpg" alt=" Whole Flathead Cabbage" class=mrg>
   [Taiwan Cabbage, Group <i>capitata</i> f. <i>alba</i>]
   <p>Marketed as "Taiwan Cabbage" in a Los Angeles Asian market, this 
   is not an Asian cabbage at all but a regular White Cabbage of the 
   flathead persuasion. In the U.S. white cabbages are described by 
   season (early, mid, late) and by shape (flat, round, etc.). This 
   cabbage can be used in the same manner as any other white cabbage. 
   The photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches in diameter, 4 inches high and 
   weighed 2 pounds.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Napa Cabbage</h2>
   <br>This is actually a turnip green - see 
   <a href="cb_green.html#napa"><b>Napa Cabbage</b></a> under <a href="cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian

   <img src="img/cb_cabred02k.jpg" alt="Cut Red Cabbage" class=mrg></a>
   [Red Kraut, Blue Kraut, Group <i>capitata</i> var. <i>f. rubra</i>]
   <p>
   Red cabbages are very similar to the white except for the red coloration 
   from Anthocyanin pigments. Color may vary from red to blue depending on 
   acidity of the soil the cabbage grew in. This red pigment is a 
   powerful antioxidant, the same one found in red wine. Red cabbage has 
   been popular in Northern Europe because it keeps better than white 
   cabbage so doesn't need to be made into sauerkraut to get through the 
   winter. Some writers say red cabbage tastes exactly like white but that 
   isn't quite true.

   [Cavolo Verza (Italy); Savoyer Kohl (Germany); <i>Brassica oleracea</i> 
   var. <i>sabauda</i> Savoy cabbage group]
   <p>
   Probably originating in the Netherlands, this cabbage is named for the 
   Savoy region of France. It is similar to White Cabbage but the leaves 
   are all crinkly, so the head is lighter in weight. The large leaves 
   are thinner  and more delicate than those of White Cabbage, but 
   unwrap easily from the head. Taste is similar to White Cabbage, but 
   this cabbage is especially desirable for raw salads and similar uses 
   due the its crinkly appearance and the fluffy appearance of shreds. 
   It also holds dressings much better than regular cabbage. The photo 
   specimen was 5-1/2  inches diameter and weighed 1-1/2 pounds.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Spitzkohl</h2>
   <br>

   [Sommerkohl, Filderkraut; group <i>capitata</i> fo. <i>alba</i> subfo. 
   <i>conica</i>]
   <p>
   This cabbage is a specialty of Germany and Central Europe. 
   It is similar to White Cabbage but the leaves are much looser, so the 
   head is lighter in weight and pointy at the top. Taste is similar 
   to White Cabbage but more delicate. The Filderkraut variety is 
   firmer, and made into specialty sauerkraut. The photo sample was 6 
   inches diameter and weighed 1-1/4 pounds. It was purchased in 
   Los Angeles in 2007, labeled "Savoy Cabbage".
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>White Cabbage</h2>
   <br><a href="cb_cabwhtz.html">
   <img src="img/cb_cabbw01k.jpg" alt="White Cabbage Head, cut" class=mrg></a>
   [Group <i>capitata</i> var <i>f. alba</i>]
   <p>This is the standard Euro/American cabbage and the one European 
   sauerkraut is made from (Asian sauerkraut is made from an entirely 
   different cabbage). Many cultivars are grown but they all look exactly 
   the same in the store. All the big loose outer leaves are removed at 
   the farm and the last semi-loose ones are removed at the store leaving 
   just a pale green ball of immature leaves. The photo specimen was a 
   typical market size at 6 inches diameter and 2 pounds, but heads 
   grown for sauerkraut can weigh up to 60 pounds.

   [Couve (Brazil), Couve-galega (Portugal), Berza (Spanish), 
   <i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Acephala</i>]
   <p>This cabbage, closely related to Kale, may have originated in 
   Western Asia, but was well known and cultivated by the ancient Greeks 
   and Romans. Either the Romans or the Celts carried it as far north as 
   Scotland. Scots took it to the American South where it was adopted by 
   slaves because it could be used similarly to African greens they were 
   accustomed to. These Collards may not be much used in Scotland today, 
   replaced by <a href="cb_green.html#sprng"><b>Spring Greens</b></a>. These are not 
   the "Collards" of West Africa, which are much more tender (see 
   <a href="cb_kalez.html"><b>Kale</b></a>). The name "Collard" is 
   probably a corruption of the old English "coleworts" (cabbage plants).

   [<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Acephala</i>]\
   <p>
   Closely related to <a href="cb_green.html#collard">Collard Greens</a>, kale comes 
   in various shades of green (mostly dark blue-green) and degrees of 
   curliness. Until the Renaissance kale was the dominant cabbage 
   throughout most of Europe and is still much grown there and in North 
   America. Unfortunately, Curly Kale is the most common form in North 
   American supermarkets, but other varieties occasionally appear. Kale 
   is considered the highest ranking vegetable for nutrition vs. calories 
   and contains powerful antioxidants.

   <p>It may look like it belongs with the root cabbages but the 
   "bulb" is actually a swollen stem, so it's all "greens". The leaves 
   are quite edible but take long simmering to be tender. The bulb is 
   similar to broccoli stem but sweeter. Generally these are eaten fairly 
   small because they become woody as they grow larger, about 2 inches 
   in the spring and 4 inches in the fall. Cultivar Gigante is still 
   edible in larger sizes. Young kohlrabi can be eaten raw in salads 
   as well as being cooked.

   [Mustard Cabbage, <i>B. juncea</i>]
   <p>
   Possibly originating in Central Asia, this species spread all through 
   Europe and China and exists as many cultivars very different from each 
   other (see <a href="cb_green.html#gaic"><b>Gai Choy</b></a> for an example). Mustard greens 
   were carried to North America and are popular in the cuisine of the 
   American South to give a touch of pungency to 
   <a href="cb_collaz.html"><b>Collards</b></a> and other greens. The

   <h2 id="rapi">Rapini</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cb_rapini13e.jpg" alt="Rapini Stalks and Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Broccoli Rabe, Broccoletti (Italian), <i>B. Rapa</i> Group <i>Ruvo</i>]
   <p>
   Though it looks much like Chinese Broccoli and has broccoli-like 
   flower heads, Rappini is actually a turnip green. Originally an 
   Italian vegetable, it is now widely grown and widely available in 
   North America. The leaves have toothy edges, exact shape and 
   toothiness depending on cultivar, and the flowers are yellow. The 
   taste is a little sharper than regular broccoli and it has a faint 
   bitterness. If a few flowers are open that's not a problem, but 
   wilting or yellowing leaves are. Rapini is a significant source of 
   vitamins A, C, and K, potassium, calcium, and iron.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2 id="sprng">Spring Greens</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cb_sprng02e.jpg" alt="Spring Greens in Garden" class=mrg>
   [Spring Greens (UK); <i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Acephala</i>]
   <p>This is properly leaves of a cabbage closely related to heading 
   cabbages, but which don't form a head, or form an extremely loose 
   head. The term is also used for young leaves of heading cabbages 
   picked before the head forms, particularly when thinning cabbage 
   plantings.</p>
   <p><i>Acephala</i> group cabbages are closer to wild cabbages 
   than the heading variety. The "Spring Greens" variety is much favored 
   in Northern  Europe due to its cold hardiness and early spring 
   appearance. These leaves are tougher, coarser, and much darker than 
   the leaves people are accustomed to from heading cabbages, and will 
   take longer cooking.</p>
   <p>In North America, the term "Spring Greens" refers to <u>any</u> 
   tender young greens, which may be lettuces, kale, chard, herbs, 
   spinach, etc. often sold as salad mixes.

   This is actually Kale, but listed separately due to confusion. A very 
   important green in East Africa, broad leaf Kale is translated as

   [<i>B. rapa rapa</i>]
   <p>Originating in Europe or Western Asia, the turnip has been cultivated since 
   prehistoric times. It is most known as a root crop and has been essential 
   to winter survival in Northern Europe for thousands of year. Some 
   varieties have been developed for their leaves rather than roots. I 
   consider this the best green for mixing up with sausages for breakfast.

   This plant grows wild on the European coasts of the Baltic and 
   North Atlantic, and around to the Black Sea, and is cultivated as a 
   vegetable. The height of its popularity was the early 19th century, 
   and it was planted in North America by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
   <p>It was, 
   and still is, eaten mainly as blanched shoots with butter or sauces, 
   similarly to white asparagus. It is rather subject to bruising and 
   damage, so its use declined as the age of transportation began. It 
   is now mainly grown in private gardens, propagated from root cuttings.

   This cultivar has recently appered in Asian markets in Los Angeles 
   (2019). It features very crinkly leaves, and a leaf to stem ratio 
   similar to Bok Choy Mui. The heads were typiclly 4-1/2 inches high

   <p> 
   Probably the most popular vegetable in the Shanghai region (Zhejiang), 
   this bok choy is now widely available in North American supermarkets.  
   It's smaller than the white stemmed bok choy they sell, so 
   supermarkets, always anxious to snag the yuppie dollar, call it 
   "Baby Bok Bhoy". Hey, yuppies buy "baby carrots" (machine made from 
   large carrots) and bags of bland "baby spinach", so "baby" anything 
   should sell.</p>
   <p>The flavor of this bok choy is somewhat different than that of the 
   white stemmed variety. Besides being light green the stems are much 
   thinner, so this variety is better suited to steam whole or split 
   lengthwise. In Asian markets a tiny "Mui" version is also 
   increasingly seen, and are very popular in China.

   <p>
   Napa Cabbage (the name comes from a Japanese word for Cabbage Leaves) 
   is what most of the world thinks of as "Chinese Cabbage", even though 
   it's actually a turnip green. In southern China that name more properly 
   belongs to <a href="cb_bokz.html"><b>Bok Choy</b></a> (also a 
   turnip green). Napa cabbage is much favored in northern China and 
   Korea, especially for its winter keeping properties.</p>
   <p>There are two common forms, the short blocky form now found in just 
   about every North American grocery store, and a long narrow form 
   pointed at the top. The long form is found in markets serving Asian 
   communities and is preferred for making Korean kimchee, Chinese 
   sauerkraut and for other fermented or pickled applications. The taste 
   and texture are the same, the long shape is simply more convenient 
   for those uses.

   This extremely mild turnip green is widely grown in China, and 
   particularly Japan. It's currently not common in regular markets 
   even here in Los Angeles, and even in Asian markets, but is easily 
   found in yuppie outlets like Whole Foods Market. You can use it raw 
   in salads or cooked in soups and stir fries. Raw I find it so mild 
   it's hardly worth the bother, but lightly steamed or stir fried it 
   has much more flavor and is quite pleasant, particularly if you 
   consider regular mustard greens too strong. In the Shanghai region 
   of China it is fermented (Snow Vegetable), or fermented and dried 
   (Shaoxing Vegetable), as popular ingredients. I use Small Gai Choy 
   as a very acceptable alternate, though it needs to be cut differently.

   a fine general purpose choy -  give the stems a head start over the 
   leaves when cooking.

   stir fries, particularly with pork or chicken. The stems, even large

   some crunch. Actually, it's quite edible raw. I have recently

   These mustard greens look similar to Sher Li Hon, but much bigger.
   This plant should not be confused with the Mustard from which

   specimens were up to 32 inches long with leaves up to 10 inches wide 
   and the largest stem about 1-1/8 inch diameter.  I often find these 
   greens at a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
   2017 US $1.69 / pound.</p>
   <p>These greens are a little tougher and noticeably more pungent 
   than Sher Li Hon, but still reasonably mild. The stems are still 
   fairly tender, but do have fibers. I suggest slicing thick ones on 
   the diagonal about 1/4 inch thick at the thick end, increasing to 1 
   inch at the thin end. Stems should be given a couple minutes head 
   start before the leaves when cooking.

   are white flowers at the top and distinctive heart shaped seed pods 
   all down the stem. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; While this is the

   (<i>Kalimeris indica</i>), of the Daisy family. On the other hand, 
   I have found frozen packages of Shepherd's Purse from China properly 
   labeled "Shepherd's Purse"</p>
   <p>This plant is found in the wild and also cultivated for food. It 
   is popular in the Shanghai region of China, where the leaves are stir 
   fried with other ingredients and also used as wonton fillings and 
   especially in dumplings and pot stickers. In Japan it is included in 
   a symbolic dish made for the spring festival. In Korea the root is 
   blanched and used in namul, a dish of fresh greens and vegetables, 
   variously prepared. The plant has been used as a medicinal herb in
