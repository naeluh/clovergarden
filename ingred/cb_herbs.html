<h1>Mustard Family - Herbs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>The huge and important Cabbage / Mustard family (<i>Brassicaceae</i> 
(formerly <i>Cruciferae</i>)) is best known for the leafy greens and 
the root vegetables that got humans through the winter in earlier times. 
Nonetheless, this family also produces some popular herbs and flowers.

<h2 id="arugula">Arugula / Rocket</h2> 
<br><a href="cb_aruguz.html">
<img src="img/hb_arug08h.jpg" alt="Arugula Stems and Leaves" class=mrg></a>
[Arugula (us), Rocket (uk), Roquette (fr), Rucola (it), 
Rughetta (it), <i>B. Eruca sativa</i> (garden) <i>B. Eruca vesicaria</i>
(wild)]
<p>
This popular salad green of Mediterranean origin has been used since 
at least Roman times. Almost unknown in the U.S. a couple decades ago it 
is today the "must have" green for yuppie salads, so supermarkets stock 
pre-cut and washed bags of "baby" arugula. The leaves are small and tender 
but have a distinctly mustardy bite, backed by an unusually complex 
flavor.</p>
<p>Some varieties have leaves less deeply cut than the photo specimen and 
the leaves are very deeply cut on the wild version. The most beautiful 
bunch of Arugula I've ever purchased was from Whole Foods Market - and 
it was so flavorless it was unusable. In Italy Arugula is used in soups, 
but cooked it looses almost all its flavor. The term "Rocket" is also 
loosely used for a number of other peppery herbs.

[Kotem (Armenia); <i>B. Nasturtium nasturtium-aquaticum</i> and 
<i>N. microphyllum</i>]
<p>
Watercress, native to Europe and Western Asia, has been cultured and eaten 
since prehistoric times. Its relatively mild mustardy bite is a welcome 
addition to green salads and in sandwiches, but it's also used cooked in 
soups and other recipes. Depending on how it was grown and cut some of 
the stems can be quite large. All but the largest can be used along with 
the leaves as they are hollow, tender and have much the same flavor as the 
leaves. <a href="cb_wcressz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2 class=lrg id="cress"><u>Cress</u></h2>
<br>[Genus <i>Lepidium</i>]
<br>This genus contains 175 to 220 species worldwide (depending on expert 
consulted). Beside the members of this genus listed below, many others 
are edible with similar taste, and may be used locally. One in 
particular (Tall Whitetop; <i>Lepidium latifolium</i>) is notable, not 
for its edibility (though it is edible), but because it is a very 
aggressive and troublesome invasives in North America and elsewhere.

   [Pepper Grass, Pepperwort, Mustard and Cress, <i>B. Lepidium

   <p>
   Used similarly to <a href="cb_herbs.html#wcress">Watercress</a> this green can 
   tolerate a wider range of moisture conditions so can be grown either 
   in the garden or hydroponically, preferring a slightly alkaline 
   environment. It is said to be in great demand in some regions but I 
   have never seen it in Southern California where the broader leafed 
   cress and watercress are widely available year round. Garden cress 
   can grow to about 24 inches high and when allowed to flower it 
   produces fruits which when immature are similar to caper berries.

   <p>
   This peppery herb, a broadleaf variety of Garden Cress, is very popular 
   in the Middle East, particularly Iran. I have found it, variously 
   spelled, in Southern California produce markets serving  Armenian, 
   Middle Eastern and Persian communities. It is popular in salads, 
   sandwiches and particularly in the Persian fresh herb plate, Sabzi 
   Khordan, which accompanies most meals in Iran. It can also be a last 
   minute addition to soups. This is a dry land cress, lightly peppery and 
   less intense than Watercress, with leaves that are broader and thinner.
   The seeds are also used, and like other mustards, develop flavor and 
   hotness after being being crushed and moistened with water.

   [Pepper Grass, Pepperwort, <i>B. Lepidium</i> possibly spc. 
   <i>L. ruderale</i>, or may be a variety of <i>L. sativum</i>]
   <p>
   Of the many very different plants called "Pepper Cress", this one has 
   very fine, delicate leaves and a peppery taste quite a bit stronger 
   than that of Watercress. It can be a very good accent addition to 
   salads. The photo specimen were obtained from a specialty grower at 
   a farmer's market in Los Angeles.

   <br>   <img src="img/cb_fcress01k.jpg" alt="Flowering Field Pepperweed Plant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Lepidium campestre</i>]
   <p>
   This plant, probably originating in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, 
   has become an invasive in North America. It is found in most of the 
   southern provinces of Canada and most states of the United States, 
   but not Alaska or Texas. It grows mostly on disturbed ground, as a 
   basal rosette of long leaves, sending up flower stalks to as much as 
   2 feet high. The stalks have small, arrow shaped leaves all the way 
   up, and they branch into multiple stalks near the top.
   </p>
   <p>Young leaves and shoots from the basal rosette can be eaten raw in 
   salads or boiled for 10 minutes. Older leaves need to be boiled longer 
   and in several changes of water. Young seed pods, a little less than 
   1/4 inch long, can be used as a spice, 
   having a taste like a combination of black pepper and mustard. They 
   are particularly useful in soups and stews. Seeds from mature pods 
   can be used as a black pepper substitute.

<h2 id="upcres">Upland Cress</h2>

[American Cress, Bank Cress, Black Wood Cress, Belle Isle Cress, 
Bermuda Cress, Early Yellowrocket, Early Wintercress, Scurvy Cress, 
Creasy Greens, Land Cress; <i>Barbarea verna</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to southwestern Europe, but is now found in many 
of the eastern states of the United States, and in the west coast 
states, but distribution is patchy. This cress has long been 
cultivated in England, and some is cultivated in Florida. This cress 
is a reasonable substitute for watercress, used in salads and 
sandwiches. The leaves look much the same, but it's a bit stronger 
in taste. It is also cooked like spinach and used in soups and with 
fish. It can be grown with a lot less water than watercress, but still 
needs full sun and moist ground.

<h2 id="gmus">Garlic Mustard</h2>

[Garlic root, Hedge garlic; Sauce-alone, Jack-by-the-hedge, 
Jack-in-the-bush, Penny Hedge, Poor Man's Mustard; 
<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>]
<p>
Native to Europe, Central Asia as far as northern India, and also 
western North Africa, Garlic Mustard is a very long used seasoning. 
We have evidence it was so used in the Baltic region about 6000 years 
ago. With a flavor similar to a combination of garlic and mustard, 
the leaves are chopped and added to salads and sauces. Flowers and 
young seed pods are sometimes included. In France the seeds are used 
as a spice.</p>
<p>Garlic Mustard was brought to North America as a culinary herb 
during the 1860s, and is now a troublesome, very difficult to eradicate 
invasive, infesting 27 states, mostly Midwest and Eastern, but also 
Washington, Oregon and just a bit in Alaska. Also British Columbia, 
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada, but we have 
none here in California.

[Sweet alyssum; <i>Lobularia maritima</i> (obs. <i>Alyssum maritimum</i>)]
<p>Native to the Canary Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde, and the Bay of 
Biscay, this plant has been widely naturalized as a decorative, including 
in North America. It is an annual, but can be a short lived perennial 
under just the right conditions.  Flowers, leaves and tender stems can be 
eaten raw or cooked.

<i>Cochlearia danica</i>]
<p>
Native to Western Europe, mainly along coasts and in mountains, this 
plant is very high in vitamin C, thus is a bit sour. It is also 
somewhat bitter, but was very important for preventing or curing 
scurvy caused by lack of vitamin C on long ocean voyages. It was also 
a common souring agent until citrus became common in Europe. It 
was spread inland due to salting of roads in the winter. Seeds washing 
off vehicle wheels had little competition because scurvy grass could 
stand the salty soil at the side of roads. Note that there are 
unrelated plants also called "scurvy grass".

[Perennial wall-rocket, Sand rocket, Lincoln weed, White rocket; 
Seeds marketed as Wild Italian Arugula, Sylvetta Arugula; 
<i>Diplotaxis tenuifolia</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to Europe and Western Asia, but is now found in 
temperate regions over much of the world. The taste is similar to 
Arugula. Commercial cultivation is 
currently increasing rapidly as it is being included as "baby leaf 
rocket" (and similar names), mixed with other "baby leaf" greens to 
make the baby leaf salads so favored by yuppies.	Yuppies will pay 
extra for "baby" anything - as proven by "baby carrots" which are 
machined out of large carrots by automatic lathes.

<p>
This low but erect (to almost 12 inches) herb is native to temperate 
Europe and Asia from England to Japan. Some grows as far north as 
Finland but only in warmer micro-climates. It is an invasive in much 
of eastern United States and Canada, and appears in California and 
Washington state.  Leaves are edible raw or 
cooked and have a sharp peppery taste. They are used as a garnish 
and herbal ingredient in the cuisine of Manipur in the far east of 
India (east of Bangladesh). Manipur cuisine does not use curry spices, 
but many local herbs and plenty of chilis. The roots are also edible 
raw or cooked. This plant is listed on
