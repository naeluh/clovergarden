[Meerrettich (German); Seiyo Wasabi (Japan); <i>B. Armoracia rusticana</i>]
<p>
This pungent white fleshed root was known in Roman times, probably 
originating in southeastern Europe. Today it is grown worldwide for use 
as a condiment, particularly popular in Germany, Poland, Russia and 
surrounding countries. Actually, about 85% of the worlds supply is grown 
in the bottomlands surrounding Collinsville, Illinois where the soil is 
just the way horseradish likes it.  A mixture of horseradish, mustard 
seeds and green food coloring is used as a condiment in Japanese 
sushi bars, even in Japan, because real 
<a href="cb_wasabz.html">Wasabi</a> is so costly and perishable.</p>

<h3>Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; Horseradish leaves are used in pickles in Russia.

<h3>Buying & Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Look for fresh horseradish roots in 
markets that serve central, northern and eastern European communities 
including Russia and as far south as the Balkans. Roots should be hard and 
wet with no trace of decay or softening.
<p>Wrapped loosely in plastic and stored in the refrigerator horseradish 
will last a month or more. Well, actually, I found a root in the bottom 
drawer of my fridge that had been there for at least 9 months. I cut 
the moldy end off and stuck it in the ground. It grew vigorously.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Freshly grated horseradish root is added 
directly to many dishes, including soups, but the most common use is as 
horseradish sauces. For method and recipes see our
