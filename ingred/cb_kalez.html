<p>Kale was well known in Europe before Roman times and until the 
Renaissance was the predominant type of cabbage in Europe. In fact it was 
the dominant green, particularly valued for being available well into 
winter. Genetically, kale is very closely related to Collard Greens.</p>

<h2>Types of Kale</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Some important varieties are:

<ul>
<li><h3>Curly Kale:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most common type of kale in 
  North America and is found in practically every supermarket. 
  Unfortunately, it's the most difficult variety to deal with in the 
  kitchen.</li>
<li><h3>Black / Tuscan Kale:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most popular kale in 
  Italy. It is somewhat more tender than curly kale and it's more orderly 
  leaves are easier to work with.</li>
<li><h3>Red Kale:</h3> &nbsp; This frilly, red veined variety is less common 
  than curly and black and, like black, is more tender and easier to 
  manage than curly kale.</li>
<li><h3>Dinosaur Kale:</h3> &nbsp; This variety is found mainly in 
  Farmer's Markets, and is much like Tuskan Kale, but less wrinkled.</li>
<li><h3>Sukuma Wiki:</h3> &nbsp; Translated as "Collard Greens" in 
  East Africa, this very important green is actually various varieties 
  of broad leafed Kale, much more tender than our North American 
  Collard Greens. The variety in the photo is Portuguese Kale.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Curly Kale can be found in practically any 
  supermarket in North America. Vast amounts are grown in California and 
  shipped everywhere. Black and Red kale are best found in the Farmer's 
  Markets which abound here in Southern California.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp;  Loosely wrapped Kale will keep in the 
  refrigerator for more than a week, but will gradually lose its vitamin 
  content.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Wash just before use. Kale is float washed as you 
  would spinach because the textures tend to hold grit and mud. The stems 
  are usually discarded because they are very tough. Fold the two sides 
  against each other and the stem will be easy to cut away.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Kale, particularly curly kale, takes a fair 
  amount of cooking, a reason why it often appears in soups. Other 
  Kales may cook more quickly.
  <p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Kale is 
  considered the highest of all vegetables for nutrition per calorie. 
  Kale is very high in Beta Carotene, Vitamin K, Vitamin C, Lutein, 
  and Zeaxanthin, and fairly high in Potassium, Phosphorus, Magnesium 
  and Calcium.
  <p>When kale is chopped or chewed, enzymes produce Sulforaphane which 
  is considered a potent anti-cancer substance, which also helps with 
  diabetes and is antimicrobial. It is also thought to help inhibit 
  heart inflammation.</p>
  <p>Persons taking warfarin or other anti-coagulants are cautioned 
  against eating Kale due to its high vitamin K content.</p>
