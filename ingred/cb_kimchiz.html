<h1>Kimchi / Kimchee</h1>
<br><img src="img/cb_kimchi02g.jpg" alt="Bowls of Cabbage &amp; Radish Kimchi" class=mrg>
Absolutely indispensable at any Korean meal, this is a salt fermented 
vegetable pickle made in Korea, Manchuria, and northern China since 
ancient times. Napa cabbage (actually a turnip green) and Radish (daikon) 
are most common, but there must be hundreds of distinct recipes that include 
many different vegetables and seafood. I have one cookbook that has 72 recipes 
for different kinds of Kimchi. The photo shows cabbage kimchi 
on the left and radish on the right. Typically, Kimchi is bright red, but 
pretty mild by Southern California standards - though folks from the 
Frozen North may disagree.

<p>Officially, in 1966 at a food science convention in Poland, the English 
spelling was standardized as "Kimchee". Here in Los Angeles, where kimchi 
production is measured in tons per day (and I don't mean just a few), that 
spelling is totally ignored in favor of "Kimchi". All the best cookbooks 
printed in English (or Korean) use "Kimchi".</p>

While kimchi has been made for perhaps 3000 years, and from many vegetable 
mixes, the biggest change came in the early 1700s when chili peppers brought 
to Asia by the Dutch and Portuguese became incorporated into the mix. Today 
most people just presume that kimchi has plenty of red chili in it, but 
white kimchis are still made. The photo to the left shows a white radish 
kimchi which is quite popular here in Southern California.</p>

<p>Cabbage kimchi is the most popular, and my favorite, with daikon radish 
second. The cabbage may be chopped coarsely as shown in the photo - or the 
jar may just be stuffed with a couple whole cabbages. The cabbages used are 
of the same sort as our Napa Cabbage, but an elongated cultivar is selected, 
particularly for "whole cabbage kimchi". See also <a href="cb_kimchiz.html#trivia">
<b>Trivia</b></a>.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Some pretty dismal kimchi is sold in small jars 
in non-Korean stores. Excellent kimchi can be had in just about any 
Korean market, at least here in Los Angeles. Always buy from refrigerated 
cases - if it's not refrigerated it must be pasteurized (spelled 
"r u i n e d"). It's best to buy in 1/2 gallon or larger jars if you can 
eat that much, but if you buy smaller jars buy a brand the store is also 
selling in 1/2 gallon and 1 gallon sizes. If they're selling it in jars 
that large they must have customers who really like it.<p></p>

<h3>Vegetarian Note:</h3> &nbsp; While kimchi is nearly all vegetable, 
most formulas contain a small amount of oysters, shrimp or fish sauce 
(made from anchovies) so if you're really, really strict and would be 
devastated to know you consumed some seafood, read the ingredients list 
<u>carefully</u> (or don't read the list and claim ignorance - a better 
strategy, actually - it's called "don't ask, don't tell"). MSG is not 
included in the kimchis made around here.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Kimchi is a live culture, so it will change and 
eventually spoil if mistreated. It is best kept refrigerated and consumed 
within a week.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Kimchi is generally served as a side dish or 
condiment (a Korean table will have several small dishes along with the 
main dish). In some cooked dishes, particularly with soups and stews, 
kimchi is used as a major ingredient - just follow the recipe.<p></p>

<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3> &nbsp; While these designations are pretty much 
irrelevant here in North America, there is a set of designations in Korea for 
different fermentations of Napa Cabbage, and probably other Kimchis. 
<ul>
<li><b>Geotjeori:</b> &nbsp; Fresh, unfermented Kimchi. This is much like 
  a salad and the cabbage is bright white.</li>
<li><b>Kimchi:</b> &nbsp; This is the fermented Kimchi that we know and love 
  here in North America.</li>
<li><b>Shin Kimchi:</b> &nbsp; This is Kimchi that has been over-fermented. 
  It is more acidic, and is often used in cooked dishes that use Kimchi as 
  a major flavoring. Making these with regular Kimchi, we add more of the 
  juice from the jar.</li>
<li><b>Mugeungi:</b> &nbsp; This is the product made in buried crocks for 
  use in the winter. It is slowly fermented at very low temperatures for at 
  least 6 months, when it will be very pungent.</li>
  </ul>
