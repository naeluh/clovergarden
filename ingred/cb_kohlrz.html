Like head cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and 
Brussels sprouts, Kohlrabi was created from wild cabbage by human 
selection. It may look like it belongs with the root cabbages but the 
"bulb" is actually a swollen stem so it's all "greens", and is similar 
to broccoli stem, but sweeter and easier to work with.</p>
<p>Generally, Kohlrabi are eaten fairly small because they become woody 
as they grow larger, but one cultivar, Gigante, is still edible in 
larger sizes. Kohlrabi are usually marketed at about 2 inches in the 
spring and 4 inches in the fall. Young kohlrabi can be eaten raw in 
salads as well as being cooked.

Kohlrabi aren't necessarily green, but you won't find purple ones in your 
local supermarket, only in the more adventurous farmer's markets. The 
interior of the purple stem is pale, like the green kohlrabi.</p>

<p>While developed in Europe, and usually associated with northern 
Europe, kohlrabi is well known in temperate zones from Pakistan through 
China. It is an important vegetable in Kashmir, where they also grow 
a version without a swollen stem, just leaves, called Haakh. The bulb 
version is called Monj-haakh. As Knol Khol and Ganth Gobhi it is 
popular in other parts India, mostly in the north. In some parts of 
China it is called "Jade Turnip".</p>

<p>Kolrabi leaves are quite edible and nutritious, but they are tough, 
much like Collard Greens, and need to be simmered at least 45 minutes 
to be tender. Leaf stems will still be crunchy and a bit fibrous with 
that length of cooking.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable is so popular in the German 
speaking parts of Europe, nearly every supermarket and produce market 
in North America has it. To avoid fibrous bulbs, in the spring, buy 
them at about 2 inches diameter, and about 4 inches in the autumn.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; In the refrigerator, the leaves will yellow 
in a few days, but the stem bulb can be stored for up to a month loosely 
wrapped in plastic. If you bought leafy ones, just cut the leaves 
off, leaving a inch of leaf stem on the bulbs. You can cook them as 
greens, but keep in mind they need long cooking similar to Colards.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Slice about a quarter of an inch off the root 
end, then peel. There are two layers of fiber under the skin but they 
are thin and easily seen. Slice, dice or julienne as needed by the 
recipe.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; For bulbs without leaves, after trimming and 
peeling, 1 pound will yield 12 ounces (72%).<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Young Kohlrabi is often used raw in salads 
and slaws, and I have found bulbs up to 4 inches to be fine for this 
use late in the year. The greens can be used interchangeably with 
Collards or Kale or Chinese Broccoli.<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp;  Like other 
members of the cabbage family, Kohlrabi is highly nutritious, with plenty 
of vitamin C, vitamin A (especially the greens), vitamin K, and B-complex. 
It provides minerals copper, potassium, manganese, iron, and calcium, and 
is high in fiber and low in calories. It also has a good selection of 
phytochemicals, such as isothiocyanates, sulforaphane, and 
indole-3-carbinol that are thought to protect against prostate and 
colon cancers, along with plenty of antioxidants.<p></p>
