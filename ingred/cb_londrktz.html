Caution: This is <b>NOT</b> the "Teff" from which Injera bread is made 
in Ethiopia and Eritrea, even though it looks a lot like it. This one is 
a Mustard Seed, not a Grain, and is used in Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan 
in the making of Sharbat-e Khakshir, a refreshing cold soft drink, and 
as a medicinal. The dried leaves are used by the Bedouin as a Tobacco 
substitute. It got the name "London Rocket" because it grew so 
prolifically after the Great London Fire, and was also found around bomb 
craters during the Blitz. The tiny seeds are about 0.01 inch wide 
(0.25 mm) and about 0.015 inches long (0.38 mm).

This plant is now a naturalized invasive in California, particularly 
in the southern third. It is easy to recognize by its yellow flowers, 
low growth (to 18 inches) and extremely long thin seed pods (to the left 
in photo). It blooms from June to August, and seeds are ripe between 
July and September.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This "Teff" can sometimes be found in markets 
serving a Middle Eastern community, though the market I found it in 
here in Los Angeles (Montrose, actually) serves mostly an Armenian 
community. In a 3 ounce bag, it cost 2016 US $1.50 / ounce. It was 
<a href="http://www.ofdusa.com">Golchin</a> brand, distributed by 
Overseas Food Distribution in Chatsworth, California.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In its resealable bag (or other airtight 
container, kept  away from heat and light, it should be good for at 
least 6 months.<p></p>

<h3>Using:</h3> &nbsp; For Sharbat-e Khakshir the seeds are used 
whole, mixed with water, a little sugar, a dash of rosewater, perhaps 
herbs, and lots of ice. Stir it up a little and take a sip. Medicinally, 
you skip everything except Khakshir and water - medicine isn't supposed 
to taste good, that would probably reduce its effectiveness.<p></p>
