<h1>Mustard Seed, Powder <small>&amp;</small> Oil</h1>
<br><img src="img/cb_mustsd05f.jpg" alt="Mustard Seeds" class=mrg>
  <br>
  [White Mustard; <i>Sinapis alba</i> alt <i>Brassica hirta</i>, 
  <i>B. alba</i> | Black Mustard <i>Brassica nigra</i> 
  | Brown Mustard, Indian Brown Mustard, Leaf Mustard; <i>Brassica juncea</i>]
<p></p>
<h3>White Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; This seed (actually tan or yellow), 
is the norm in Europe, and used to make the Prepared Mustard (top left 
in photo) we buy in jars and squeeze bottles.<p></p>

<h3>Black Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; This seed (bottom left in photo) is 
the one used in India as a spice in cooking. It also serves as a 
temperature gage. Spices including mustard seeds are put in the pan with 
oil and heated. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, the oil is hot 
enough and other ingredients are added to the pan. It is smaller than 
European yellow mustard seeds but the flavor is pretty similar. The 
photo specimens were 0.073 inch diameter.<p></p>

<h3>Brown Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; This one is grown in Russia for 
seed oil and to produce "Hot Russian Mustard", and may also appear with 
yellow mustard seeds in Mustard Powder. It is also used to produce 
mustard greens in Russia and Asia.<p></p>

<h2>Mustard Powder</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Blend of <i>Brassica juncea</i> 
  (brown mustard)  with <i>Sinapis alba</i> (white mustard)]
<br><img src="img/cb_mustsdp01h.jpg" alt="Pile of Mustard Powder" class=mrg>
<p>
Most recipes calling for mustard powder presume using Colman's brand, 
one of the earliest manufacturers (1814) of this very finely powdered 
mustard, and that product (now owned by Unilever) is widely available. 
Dry it is almost flavorless. For use as a condiment it is mixed with 
water to make a paste and allowed to stand for 10 minutes or so until 
enzymes produce the pungency. It should be mixed fresh for use as the 
pungency fades fairly quickly, unless stabilized with acid.

<h2>Rai Kuria</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Split Mustard Seeds; <i>Sinapis alba</i>]
<br><img src="img/cb_musth01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Mustard Seeds" class=mrg>
<p>
This product is hulled and split mustard seeds, sort of a mustard dal (right 
in photo). It is used in some Indian spice mixes, particularly Gujarati Achar 
Masala, a spice mix used in Achar pickles, and in many Achari recipes. How it 
is made I am not sure, but India is expert at making hulled and split legumes. 
Hulled mustard seed is much used in North America and Europe to produce 
mustard powders and prepared mustards, but it is crushed between rollers and 
then sifted, so it is not whole split mustard seeds like these. &nbsp; 
<u>Subst</u>: Whole yellow mustard seeds. Not as strong, so use about half 
again what the recipe calls for, and grind very fine.

<h2>Mustard Seed Oil</h2>
<br><a href="oi_mustz.html">

Mustard seed is also pressed for oil, and mustard oil is an important 
cooking oil in parts of India, particularly in the North, and 
considered essential to accurately reproduce the traditional cuisine. It 
is also an important cooking oil in parts of China and Russia. Today, in 
India, it has been largely replaced by industrially produced seed oils 
which are much cheaper, but possibly more dangerous to health.
<p>Mustard Oil can be found in markets serving an Indian community. It 
is always labeled "For massage use only" because it does not have FDA 
approval for use as food. This is due to its erucic acid content, 
formerly considered dangerous. It is now thought possibly dangerous 
in regions of extreme poverty where it is the only fat in the diet, 
but suspicion has lately shifted from erucic acid to excess Omega-3 
oils.<p>

<p>Mustard oil has a somewhat acrid taste as pressed. In India, it is 
usually heated until the first wisp of smoke is seen, then taken off 
the heat to cool a little. This changes the taste, making it much more 
pleasant. It may also reduce the Omega-3 content, but it is still 
controversial if the body can really use plant Omega-3 effectively. 
There is also increasing suspicion that plant Omega-3s may be dangerous 
if too much is consumed. For more details on Mustard Oil see our 
<a href="oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Seed Oil</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Mustard Oil is often confused with Rapeseed Oil and Canola Oil (a low 
erucic acid form of rapeseed oil). This oil comes from the seeds 
<i>Brassica napus</i>, a kind of Turnip. It's fairly closely related to 
Mustards, but a different species, and the oils are not identical. For 
details on rapeseed oil, see our 
<a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a> page.

<h2>Mustard Greens</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_mustgn01k.jpg" alt="Greens" class=mrg>
There are several kinds of Mustard Greens, Western and Asian. These are 
usually from varieties of mustard developed specifically for greens, and 
not the varieties grown for seeds and oil. For details see our 
<a href="cb_green.html">Cabbage, Mustard Turnip &amp; Radish Greens</a> 
page.
