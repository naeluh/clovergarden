Napa Cabbage (the name comes from a Japanese word for Cabbage Leaves) 
is what most of the world thinks of as "Chinese Cabbage", even though 
it's actually a turnip green. Napa cabbage is much favored in northern 
China and Korea, especially for its winter keeping properties. In 
southern China, the name "Chinese Cabbage" more properly belongs to 
<a href="cb_bokz.html">Bok Choy</a> (also a turnip green).</p>
<p>There are two common forms, the short blocky form now found in just 
about every North American grocery store, and a long narrow form pointed 
at the top. The long form is found in markets serving Asian communities 
and is preferred for making Korean kimchee, Chinese sauerkraut and for 
other fermented or pickled applications. The taste and texture are the 
same, the long shape is simply more convenient for those uses.</p>
<p>The flavor of Napa Cabbage is different from that of real cabbage 
and the stem ends of the ribs are much thinner. The entire leaf is 
somewhat crisp and slightly sweet. From the fibrous white leaf ribs it 
is sometimes called "celery cabbage" but the fibers are tender, nowhere 
near as tough as those in celery. Napa cooks quickly so is suitable for 
stir fries and it does not give off a cabbage smell when it cooks.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Napa cabbage is not 
at all hard to find in North America, as most grocery stores regularly 
carry the blocky form. The elongated form is found in many Asian markets. 
Stored in the refrigerator, loosely wrapped in plastic, Napa will keep 
a month or more. The outer leaves may be a bit yellowed and spotted 
after long storage, but just peel them off.<p></p>
