<h1>Pickled &amp; Preserved Cabbages</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>These pickled products have been made in cold northern regions since 
the dawn of history - wherever salt could be affordably obtained. Without 
salt some versions could be made with vinegar. They were of critical 
importance for winter sustenance and to avoid vitamin deficiency diseases. 
With today's transportation this is no longer strictly necessary in most 
regions, but these products are still valued for their unique flavors and 
textures.</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>These products are quite suitable for making in your home. but one 
thing to keep in mind is using natural sea salt. I emphasize "natural", 
because many major brands of "sea salt" are highly refined. If it doesn't 
seem a little moist, it's not natural. This refinement is done to make 
a salt usable in salt shakers, and the removed minerals are sold for 
industrial use.</p>
<p>Many pundits tell you that "salt is salt, it's nearly all sodium 
chloride", but some of the trace salts in sea salt can be important to 
proper fermentation. Koreans say only unrefined sea salt should be used 
for salt pickling, and there's nobody with more experience in salt 
pickling than the Koreans.</p>
<p>Refined salt also often includes flow agents which can cloud pickling 
liquids. Whether or not it is iodized is irrelevant. Of course you can 
buy sea salt from gourmet outlets for astounding prices, but the best 
place to buy the real thing at an acceptable price is from a Korean 
market. For details see our <a href="salt.html">Salt</a> 
page.</p>

<h2>Sauerkraut</h2>
<br><a href="cb_skrautz.html">
<img src="img/cb_skraut02h.jpg" alt="Sauerkraut shreds" class=mrg></a>
[Kapusta Kwaszona (Poland); Kvashenoyi Kapusty (Ukraine); Kvashenaya 
kapusta (Russia); Sauerkraut (German, English); Zuurkool (Netherlands); 
Chocrute (French); Liberty Cabbage (North America during World War I), 
Victory Cabbage (North America during World War II)]
<p>
Sauerkraut is cabbage that is salted to a precise degree and allowed to 
ferment, pressed under its own brine, through several generations of 
bacteria until it reaches a desired degree of sourness from a final 
lactic acid fermentation. It is then refrigerated or canned to stop 
further fermentation. It is usually shredded before fermentation, but 
In some cases it is made with lengthwise wedges of cabbage rather than 
shredded.</p>
<p>Sauerkraut is very important to the cuisines of Germany, Poland, 
   Russia, Hungary, Netherlands and parts of the Balkans. It is also 
   popular in parts of France and Italy that have German exposure. 
   Sauerkraut consumption has been declining in North America, which 
   is not surprisingly since it is often prepared with little care.

<h2 id="asia" class=lrg>Cabbage Greens - Asian</h2>
<p></p>
<p>While they are called "Cabbages", these Asian products are all 
actually <b>Turnip Greens</b> rather than true cabbages.

<h2>Pickled Chinese Cabbage</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_napask06e.jpg" alt="Napa Cabbage, Pickled" class=mrg>
[Sour Snow Cabbage]
<p>This is simply Sauerkraut made with Napa cabbage (actually a turnip 
green). It is often made from whole cabbages, using a long narrow cultivar 
rather than the short fat ones common in our markets, but may also be made 
from separated leaves or even shredded leaves. Naturally, the flavor is 
somewhat different from that of white head cabbage sauerkraut, and is 
often somewhat milder.</p>
<p>This product is usually found in vacuum packed plastic bags and should 
be kept refrigerated, especially after opening the package.  Typically, 
Cabbage, Salt, Lactic Acid Culture, but may also include Vitamin C (to 
preserve color), Potassium bisulfate (a sterilizing agent) and/or Sodium 
sulphate (to preserve color).

[Kimchee]<p>
Absolutely indispensable at any Korean meal, this is a salt fermented 
vegetable pickle made in Korea, Manchuria, and northern China since 
ancient times. Napa cabbage (actually a turnip green) and Radish (daikon) 
are most common, but there must be at least a hundred distinct recipes 
that include many different vegetables. The photo shows cabbage kimchi 
on the left and radish on the right. Kimchi is bright red but fairly mild 
by Southern California standards - though folks from the Frozen North may 
disagree.

<h2 id="tianj">Tianjin Preserved Vegetable</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cb_tianjin01h.jpg" alt="Jar of Preserved Cabbage" class=mrg>
<p>[Tianjin dongc&agrave;i; (China = Tianjin winter vegetable)]
</p><p>
Often still found in its traditional ceramic jars, this popular 
preserve is from Tianjin, a city state between Beijing and the Yellow 
Sea in northern China. I am surprised so few cookbook recipes call for it 
because it's ubiquitous availability in Asian markets would indicate wide 
use. In China it's used to flavor stir fries and stews. The flavor is 
fairly strong, reminiscent of fermented black beans.</p>
<p>The main ingredient is an elongated form of Nappa Cabbage similar to 
the one Koreans use to make cabbage kimchi. It's not actually a cabbage 
but a turnip green.  Ingred: Tianjin Cabbage, Garlic, Salt. A version 
without garlic is also made for certain Buddhist sects that are 
restricted to bland food, but I've not noticed it in California. This 
product keeps indefinitely in a sealed container in a cool location.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Preserved Cabbage</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_preserv01h.jpg" alt="Preserved Cabbage Flakes" class=mrg>
This product is from Thailand and patterned after the Tianjin Preserved 
Vegetable, as evidenced by it's translucent plastic jar being the exact 
same shape as the Tianjin ceramic jar but smaller. It is, however, much 
lighter in both color and flavor. Cabbage 80%, Salt 10%, Sugar 5%, 
Garlic 5%. This product will keep indefinitely in a sealed container 
in a cool location.

<h2>Sour Mustard Greens</h2>
<br><a href="cb_mstprez.html">
<img src="img/cb_mustpkl04e.jpg" alt="Head of Mustard, Sour Pickled" class=mrg></a>
A very common ingredient in Chinese soups and stir fries, it's basically 
sauerkraut made with mustard greens. This is clearly not the same mustard 
plant that's well known to our Southern cuisine, but an Asian mustard 
called Gai Choy that has short, heavily ribbed leaves. While the photo 
shows a whole large head, Sour Mustard Greens are often made from much 
smaller plants, and smaller packages may contain only slices of the 
plant.

<h2>Preserved Chinese Mustard Greens</h2>
<br><a href="cb_mstprez.html">
<img src="img/cb_mustgp02e.jpg" alt="Whole Preserved Mustard Greens" class=mrg></a>
<p>These preserved mustard greens are a bit lighter and closer to fresh 
greens flavor than the Tianjin Preserved Vegetable. It is a good general 
purpose preserved vegetable for stir fries and the like. Float was to 
reduce salt and remove sand. . It is made from heads of Large Gai Choy. 
Ingred: Chinese Mustard Greens, Salt, Sugar, Sulphur Dioxide. Store in 
a sealed container in a cool location.

Ja choi, Cha tsoi (Cantonese); Zasai (Japan); Praeserviertes Gemuese 
(French); Sichuan (various spellings) Vegetable;  <i>Brassica juncea</i> 
subspecies <i>tatsai</i>]
<p>
This is a salt fermented pickled vegetable made from the lower stems of 
a mutant mustard cultivar with strangely swollen stems. This variety 
appeared in Sichuan provence and first became popular there, but it is 
now also used in other cuisines of Southern China. It is very salty and 
needs to be rinsed thoroughly before use. The photo specimens, 
purchased out of a tub in a Los Angeles Asian market (Alhambra), were 
about 3 inches in diameter and  weighed 8-3/4 ounces each.

<p>From Yibin in southern Sichuan, this is salted and fermented Mustard 
Stems, but regular leaf stems, not mutant swollen stems like 
<a href="cb_pickle.html#zhacai"><b>Zhacai</b></a>. Suimi simply means it has been 
chopped small. It comes in two varieties, savory and sweet. It is the 
sweet version that is most famous. and essential for Dan Dan Noodles 
and other dishes. The savory is wilted, salted and fermented for 3 to 6 
months. The sweet starts as the savory and is taken out of the pickle 
and simmered with brown sugar for at least 8 hours, then hung up to dry 
again. Following that it is packed back in the jars and fermented for 
another 3 months to a year. &nbsp; Subst: The closest is 
<a href="cb_pickle.html#tianj"><b>Tianjin Preserved Vegetable</b></a>, but it is not 
nearly as sweet.

<h2>Salted Mustard Stem</h2>

<img src="img/cb_mustslt01h.jpg" alt="Salted Mustard Stem" class=mrg>
This item appears to be made made from the same swollen mustard stems 
Szechwan Vegetable is made from, but treated rather differently, fan 
sliced two ways and preserved in salt and soy sauce. This would be for 
the folks up north around Beijing, who appreciate chili fire even less 
than in Minnesota. It can be sliced up and used in stir fries. The photo 
specimen weighed 13-1/4 ounces - Ingredients: Mustard, Salt, Soy Sauce.

  <p>In East Asian packaging the word "Turnip" actually means "Daikon 
  Radish". Usually these daikons are a short stubby version rather than 
  the long carrot shaped Japanese style. They are salt pickled and may be 
  whole or more commonly are cut into strips. This product is now often 
  sold in vacuum bags and can be kept for months at room temperature.

<p>In East Asian packaging the word "Turnip" actually means "Daikon

being pickled are simply preserved in salt, lots of salt. Traditionally 
they were rolled up into balls weighing 1-1/2 ounces but that form isn't 
common now.

<p>In East Asian packaging the word "Turnip" actually means "Daikon

shaped Daikon, and is the whole plant with the greens topped and lesser 
roots trimmed off. It's been simply preserved in salt, lots of salt, 
and it needs a good soaking before use.

This product is very popular in Japan and Korea as a side dish. In 
Japan and California it is also used in sushi rolls. The Japanese also 
have a white daikon pickled in sake with koji culture still in it. The 
photo specimens are factory made, and the yellow dyed with food coloring 
- but not the hideous fluorescent yellow color many are done in.

Popular in the Levant, Middle East and North Africa, these turnips 
are almost always pickled with a few slices of beet for color. Once again, 
this product is far better in flavor and nutrition naturally salt 
fermented, but what you can buy in stores is factory made with salt and 
vinegar. The photo samples were Mid East brand, presumably Southern 
California made and listing only Water, Turnips, Beets, Vinegar and Salt. 
They foamed a bit on opening so there was some natural fermentation 
going on.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p>These products preserve much of the healthy nutrients cabbage leaves 
and roots are famous for, but do include a lot of salt. Since they are mainly 
used as flavoring ingredients, often in modest quantity, they simply take the 
place of salt that would otherwise be added to the recipe.</p>
<p>Medical reports from Taiwan indicate women there have an elevated chance 
of colo-rectal cancer if they eat a lot of pickled vegetables. The effect on 
men is reported to be much less. The researchers studying this issue have 
found that eating peanuts a couple of times a week dramatically reduces the 
incidence of colo-rectal cancer, particularly in women.</p>
