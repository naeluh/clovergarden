<h1>Romanesco Cauliflower</h1>
<br><img src="img/cb_roman24f.jpg" alt="Head of Romanesco" class=mrg>
[Fractal Broccoli; Chou Romanesco (French); Broccolo romanesco, 
Cavolo romanesco (Italian); Pyramidenblumenkohl(German); 
<i>Brassica oleracea</i> Group <i>Botrytis</i>]
<p>
This flowering cabbage is a stunning example of how nature encodes 
large amounts of genetic information in a mathematical form called 
fractals. The head is a cone, made up of spirals of smaller but 
otherwise identical spiral cones, which are in turn made up of smaller 
spiral cones, ad infinitum. Actually all cauliflowers are built pretty 
much this way, it just isn't so clear and orderly.</p>

<p>Although first reported from Italy in the 16th century, acceptance of 
this variety has been held back by a fierce dispute as to whether it is 
a broccoli or a cauliflower. The ISHS (International Society for 
Horticultural Science) has published a study which states, "Multivariate 
analyses are presented which support the view that cultivars grouped 
within the form Purple Cauliflower should be placed in the same botanical 
variety as Broccoli/Calabrese (var. italica) and those of Romanesco with 
Cauliflower (var. botrytis)". So there, now you can eat it - but take care, 
it reacts very poorly to over-cooking. Steam until just tender.</p>

<p>Romanesco is smaller, lighter in density, more tender and faster 
cooking than regular Cauliflower. The flavor is quite mild and a little 
more broccoli-like. It is best to serve it as whole florets, both for 
visual effect and so the pieces are large enough that the flavor can be 
easily appreciated. It is also fine eaten raw in salads and the like.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage:</h3> &nbsp; This is usually not easy to find, 
and the fact that it's season is very short doesn't help. Sometimes, 
when a new supermarket opens, they will have some to impress the peasants 
with their wide range of choices. Then it disappears forever. It is more 
likely to be found in places like Whole Foods Market. That's where the 
photo specimen came from, at a price I'd rather not remember. The whole 
head weighed about 1-1/4 pounds with some leaves attached, and was 
purchased in February, in Southern California.

<p>Select heads that are fresh looking and not badly bruised. If there 
are leaves they should look fresh. Unfortunately, heads are often handled 
roughly, and the points of the cones are bruised. For the price they're 
sold at they should be given special care to avoid this.</p>

<p>Heads that are fresh and in good condition can be kept in the 
refrigerator, loosely wrapped in plastic and protected from bruising, 
for a week or so.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable should be used in very simple 
recipes that will preserve its appearance. The best way to cook it is 
to steam it, either as a whole head or broken into florets. It does not 
tolerate overcooking very well.

<p>Because of the difference in cooking time between stems and flowers, 
it's best, when dividing into florets, to split the stems lengthwise, in 
half for small stems, quarters for larger. Florets should be steamed for 
about 9 minutes, a whole head a bit longer. If you cook in boiling salted 
water the time will be shorter.</p>

<h3>Acids:</h3> &nbsp; Lemon juice, vinegar and other acids will quickly 
dull the green color, and the hotter it is the faster it will dull. If 
you use acid in a recipe it should be added after the romanesco is 
removed from the heat and it should then be served immediately.<p></p>

<h3>Health and Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Like other cabbages, Romanesco 
is very nutritious. It is rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K 
and carotenoids.<p></p>
