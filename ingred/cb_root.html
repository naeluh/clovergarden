<h1>Cabbage Roots</h1> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <h2> Radish, Turnip, etc.</h2>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Cabbage roots (of family <i>Brassicaceae</i> (formerly <i>Cruciferae</i>)) 
have often meant the difference between survival and not for peoples 
living in cold northern climates - particularly before the potato arrived 
from the New World. Many of these roots store well and are highly 
nutritious. Most of the plump tender roots we know today were developed 
from thin, stringy roots by human tinkering, careful genetic selection 
over thousands of years.</p>

<h2>Horseradish</h2>

<img src="img/cb_hradish17e.jpg"  alt="Horseradish root" class=mrg></a>
[Meerrettich (German), Seiyo Wasabi (Japan); <i>Armoracia rusticana</i>]
<p>
This pungent white fleshed root was known in Roman times, probably 
originating in southeastern Europe. Today it is grown worldwide for use 
as a condiment, particularly popular in Germany, Poland, Russia and 
surrounding countries. Actually, about 85% of the worlds supply is 
grown in the bottomlands surrounding Collinsville, Illinois where the 
soil is just the way horseradish likes it.  A mixture of horseradish, 
mustard seeds and green food coloring is used as a condiment in 
Japanese sushi bars, even in Japan, because real 
<a href="cb_wasabz.html">Wasabi</a> is so costly and perishable.

<h2>Maca</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_maca02k.jpg"  alt="Roots" class=mrg>
[Maca-maca, Maino, Ayak chichira, Ayak willku; <i>Lepidium meyenii</i> 
(USDA) alt <i>Lepidium peruvianum</i> (current)]
<p>
Native to the Andes mountains of Bolivia and Peru this plant looks very 
much like a radish, but is closely related to 
<a href="cb_herbs.html#gcress">Garden Cress</a>. The three most 
commonly cultivated and exported varieties are Cream, Red and Black. They 
are used both as food and as medicinals - said to enhance strength and 
endurance and reputed to have aphrodisiac properties. This has not been 
clinically confirmed, though some tests show an increase in libido among 
healthy men. Nonetheless, this root is included in such herbal 
"enhancement" potions as actually attempt to include some active 
ingredients.</p>
<p>In its native region maca is boiled and mashed, dried and ground into 
flour for baking, fermented into a weak beer (<i>chicha de maca</i>) and 
the leaves are used in salads. Today maca cultivation has been greatly 
expanded to feed the "health food" and supplement industry. Maca is 
listed as a prescription herb in Norway but is available over the counter 
pretty much everywhere else.

<h2 class=lrg>Radishes</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>[<i>Raphanus sativa</i>]</h3> &nbsp; Radishes are a group of 
cabbages grown mostly for their pungent roots, though some greens are 
also used. Primarily used uncooked, radishes are a staple in salads 
and various appetizers.<p></p>

   <h2 id="radblk">Black Radish</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cb_radblk01h.jpg"  alt="Whole and Cut Black Radish" class=mrg>
   [Spanish Black Radish]<p>
   This Radish is particularly favored in Northeastern Europe, Poland, 
   Lithuania, Russia and Hungary, so how it got called "Spanish" in the 
   U.S. is beyond me. This is not a mild radish, falling somewhere in 
   between the red radish and horseradish in pungency, so if you can't 
   take the heat use the milder <a href="cb_daikonz.html">Daikon</a> 
   instead. Note that black radish is a lot drier than other radishes so 
   substitutes may make recipes too watery. You will find Black Radish 
   sold in markets serving Polish, Russian and Hungarian communities.

   [Japanese Radish, Korean Radish; Turnip (Asian product labeling); 
   Houa pak kaat kao (Laos)]
   <p>
   While essential to Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisines, these large 
   white radishes are thought by botanists to have originated as far west 
   as the Mediterranean and taken to East Asia some time before 500 BCE. 
   The Japanese carrot shape radishes are now available throughout the 
   U.S. even in regular supermarkets.</p>
   <p>Asian markets may have several shapes and 
   will also carry both roots and leaves in various fresh, dried, pickled 
   and salted forms. Most markets remove the leaves because they yellow 
   quickly but some farmer's markets will have them with leaves on. Korean 
   markets have smaller varieties with the tops on.</p>
   <p>These are fairly mild radishes, generally similar to a very mild 
   red radish. Most Japanese daikons are shaped like fat carrots and are 
   marketed in various sizes from a few ounces to several pounds, but in 
   Japan spherical varieties are also grown. Korean daikons are fatter 
   and shorter, often quite cylindrical. The photo specimens are: Korean, 
   4-3/4 inches diameter, 7 inches long and 3-1/4 pounds, about average 
   size; Japanese, 2-1/4 inches diameter, 12 inches long and 1-1/2 
   pounds, again about average. &nbsp;

   <h2>Red Radish</h2> 
   <br><img src="img/cb_radred01e.jpg"  alt="Whole Red, Purple and White Radishes" class=mrg>
   Here we have the standard American red radish (which is not always red) 
   found in every supermarket and farmer's market in the country. An 
   excellent addition to salads or just eaten whole, but the greens are 
   usually in not very good shape and are a bit coarse anyway. For Slavic 
   salads try to get <a href="cb_root.html#radblk">Black Radish</a>, or lacking that 
   use <a href="cb_root.html#daikon">Daikons</a>, but for American recipes this is 
   always the radish expected unless specifically stated otherwise. There 
   is pretty much no difference in flavor or hotness with color or even 
   shape (elongated versions are also sold.<p></p>

<h2 id="ruta">Rutabaga</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_rutabag01h.jpg"  alt="Rutabagas" class=mrg>
[Swede, Yellow Turnip; Turnip rooted cabbage (obs); Kalrot (Sweden (lit. 
Cabbage Root)); Rotabagge (Swedish dialect); Neep, Turnip (Scot); Turnip 
(Ireland  &amp; Atlantic Canada); <i>Brassica napobrassica</i>]
<p>
This root originated in either northern Germany or Sweden. It is an unusual 
cross between a cabbage and a turnip. In Scotland and northeastern Canada 
it is simply "turnip" because the regular white turnip is little known in 
those regions.</p>
<p>Rutabagas are little grown or eaten in Germany due to a long standing 
reputation as starvation food. One winter during World War I, called 
"The winter of Swedes", there was almost nothing else to eat and they got 
tired of them. They were brought to Ireland as cattle feed, so were a hard 
sell there as human food even during the potato famine.</p>
<p>We've heard there's been a lot of talk on the Internet by Health Food 
enthusiasts about the "health benefits" of Rutabagas, so we are linking 
to an article with actual research on the subject: 
<a href="https://healthybutsmart.com/rutabaga-benefits/">Does Rutabaga 
Have Health Benefits?</a>.

<h2 id="trans">Turnip vs. Swede, etc.</h2> - <h3>Translation Table</h3>

<p>When using cookbooks written in English it can be difficult to know 
what is meant by "Turnip" because of regional differences in English 
speaking countries. Asian cookbooks written in English toss even more 
confusion into the mix. Here's what is actually meant (unless someone 
has treacherously compensated for American readers).</p>

   <h2>Turnip - Asian</h2>
   <br>When you see East Asian recipes calling for "Turnip", or bags of 
   "Salted Turnip Leaves" or "Preserved Turnip", what is really meant is 
   one or another variety of <a href="cb_daikonz.html"><b>Daikon 
   Radish</b></a>.
   <p></p>

   <h2>Turnip - Baby</h2>
   <br>These are usually special small varieties grown for the yuppie 
   salad trade. The flesh is mild and may be of various colors: white, 
   yellow, orange or red. They are generally sold whole with leaves on 
   and need to be used quickly as they don't keep well. I haven't seen 
   them here in the Los Angeles region - all those yuppies up north 
   in Silicon Valley are probably willing to pay more.
   <p></p>

   <h2>Turnip - European</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cb_turnip07h.jpg"  alt="Turnips" class=mrg>
   [<i>B. Rapa rapa</i>]
   <p>
   This turnip is grown all over the U.S. Europe, England, Wales, and Cornwall, 
   and available in all supermarkets in these regions. It is not so much grown 
   in Scotland and Ireland where the Swede dominates, but is available in 
   larger supermarkets even there.</p>
   <p>Until the introduction of Potatoes from South America, turnips were of 
   critical importance in Northern Europe, for the survival of both people 
   and their livestock through the winter. They grow well in colder climates, 
   store plenty of food value, and can be kept in a root cellar for some 
   months after harvest. They can grow to over 2 pounds but for human 
   consumption are usually harvested much smaller when they are more tender. 
   The greens are also edible but commercial turnip greens are usually from 
   a different variety with big leaves and small roots.</p>

<h2>Wasabi</h2>
<br><a href="cb_wasabz.html">
<img src="img/cb_wasabi05h.jpg" alt="Wasabi rhizomes" class=mrg></a>
[Japanese Horseradish; <i>Wasabia japonica</i>]
<p>
This very pungent green fleshed root is used grated as a condiment, 
particularly to accompany sushi. Most sushi lovers, however, have never 
tasted wasabi. Pretty much all sushi bars in the US and nearly all in 
Japan serve a fake wasabi made from <a href="cb_hradz.html">
Horseradish</a>, mustard seeds and green food coloring. Real wasabi 
(hon-wasabi) has a more refined hotness, a sweet after-taste and is not 
nearly so bright a green as the fake. It's also very expensive and the 
flavor is extremely perishable.</p>

<p>Imported "wasabi" purchased as tiny cans of dried powder or tubes of 
paste is all faked up from horseradish. The Japanese can export 
horseradish under the name "wasabi" because the Japanese name for 
horseradish is "seiyo wasabi" (Western wasabi). They can even call it 
"real wasabi".</p>
<p>Several companies set up wasabi production in North America. At first 
they  expected to export it to Japan, but local demand has been so great 
there's little left to export. Two grades are grown in North America: 
sawa-wasabi (semi aquatic - for culinary use) and oka-wasabi (field grown 
- for the nutritional supplement industry). Fresh product is available 
from these growers (see <a href="cb_wasabz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a> for suppliers). &nbsp; <small>Photo "borrowed" from
