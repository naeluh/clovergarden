<h1>Mustard Family - Seeds <small>&amp;</small> Oils</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The huge and important Cabbage / Mustard family (<i>Brassicaceae</i> 
(formerly <i>Cruciferae</i>)) is best known for the leafy and root 
vegetables that got humans through the winter in earlier times, but 
this family also produces some important seeds and oils.</p>

<h2>Mustard Seed</h2>
<br><a href="cb_mustarz.html">
<img src="img/cb_mustsd05h.jpg" alt="Forms and Preparations of Mustard Seed" class=mrg></a>
[White Mustard; <i>Sinapis alba</i> alt 
<i>Brassica alba</i>, <i>B. hirta</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Black Mustard; 
<i>Brassica nigra</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Brown Mustard, Indian Brown 
Mustard, Leaf Mustard; <i>Brassica juncea</i>]
<p>
Mustard seeds come in three colors, white (actually yellow or tan), 
black (actually a very dark brown), and brown. White mustard seed is 
the norm in Europe and used to make prepared mustard (top left) and 
powdered mustard (top right). Black mustard seed is preferred in India 
where it is much used as a spice in cooking. Brown mustard seed is 
grown in Russia for seed oil and to produce "Hot Russian Mustard". It 
is also used to produce mustard greens in Russia and Asia. For more on 
mustard seed see our page

<h2>Canola Oil</h2>
<br><a href="oi_canolz.html">
<img src="img/oi_canola05k.jpg" alt="Flowering Canola Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Lear Oil, <i>Brassica campestris</i>]
<p>
When Canada's market for rapeseed oil, used to lubricate steam machinery, 
faded away after World War II, they needed a new market, and chose 
"health food", a choice that had worked well for some other industrial 
products that needed a new market. The FDA wouldn't let it be sold in 
the United States due to a high content of erucic acid, so they developed 
a low erucic acid variety (originally by breeding - but now it's all 
genetically engineered) called "lear oil" (Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil) 
which the FDA approved (there are rumors significant money changed hands 
to get the GRAS rating).</p>
<p>Lear Oil wasn't a sellable name, so it was re-named "Canola Oil", and 
a huge marketing campaign was launched. This campaign was so successful 
practically every recipe you read these days calls specifically for 
Canola Oil. Some actual experts in edible oils are not at all confident 
in the health safety of this oil. For details see our 
<a href="oi_canolz.html"><b>Canola Oil</b></a> page.

<h2>London Rocket - Teff</h2>
<br><a href="cb_londrktz.html">
<img src="img/cb_londrkt03h.jpg" alt="London Rocket Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Khakshir (Persian);<i>Sisymbrium irio</i>]
<p> 
Caution: This is <b>NOT</b> the "Teff" 
from which Injera bread is made in Ethiopia and Eritrea, even though it 
looks a lot like it. This one is a Mustard Seed, not a Grain, and is used 
in Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan in the making of Sharbat, a refreshing 
cold soft drink, and as a medicinal. The dried leaves are used by the 
Bedouin as a Tobacco substitute. It got the name "London Rocket" 
because it grew so prolifically after the Great London Fire, and was also 
found around bomb craters during the Blitz. The tiny seeds are about 
0.001 inch wide (0.025 mm) and about 0.0015 inches long (0.038 mm).

<h2>Mustard Seed Oil</h2>
<br><a href="oi_mustz.html">
<img src="img/cb_mustoil02h.jpg" alt="Mustard Seeds &amp; Oil" class=mrg></a>
[White Mustard; <i>Sinapis alba</i> alt 
<i>Brassica alba</i>, <i>B. hirta</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Black Mustard; 
<i>Brassica nigra</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Brown Mustard, Indian Brown 
Mustard, Leaf Mustard; <i>Brassica juncea</i>]
<p>
Mustard Oil is the traditional cooking oil of Bengal (West Bengal in 
northeast India and Bangladesh) and is used for some types of frying 
throughout northern India. It is considered essential for reproducing 
the unique flavors of the regions where it is used.  All mustard seed 
oil sold in the United States is labeled "for massage use only" because 
it lacks FDA approval. The reasons are now considered invalid, but 
there's no money for an FDA reevaluation. I suppose you can use it for 
massage (it might sting a bit) but nearly all is used for cooking.

<h2>Fendler's Bladderpod</h2>
<br><img src="img/cb_fendler01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Bladderpod Plant" class=mrg>
[Yellowtop, Lesquerella; <i>Physaria fendleri</i>]
<p>
This plant, native to southwest United States and northern Mexico, is not 
currently well known, but is increasingly in cultivation in its native 
region. Development of improved varieties is in progress. The main 
product is oil from its seeds. This oil is not used for cooking, but for 
cosmetics and feedstock for industrial products, in place of much more 
hazardous to produce castor oil. The seed coat, however, contains a gum 
that may find use in foods in place of xanthan gum. The mash from oil 
extraction is high in protein with an amino acid distribution similar to 
soybeans, so may prove to be a useful animal fodder.
