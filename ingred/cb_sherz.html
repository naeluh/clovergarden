<i>Brassica juncea</i>  var. <i>multiceps Tsen et Lee)</i>]
<p>
   These mustard greens are very mild and sweet, and the stems are 
   extremely tender - there is no need to give them a head start over 
   the leaves when cooking unless they are very large. Even at 1 inch 
   they are edible and without noticeable fibers. The leaves are thin 
   and tender. The photo specimens were up to 24 inches long with the 
   largest stem about 1 inch diameter. There are other cultivars under 
   this same name that have leaves of different shape.

<p>These greens are tasty, sweet and suitable anywhere you'd like a 
more tender green with a less assertive flavor than regular or even Asian 
mustard greens (Gai Choy).</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp;  These greens are 
just starting to appear in the Los Angeles area (2010), so they are 
probably little known outside the Southern California region, but seeds 
are available. The leaves yellow fairly soon, so they should be stored 
in the fridge, loosely warpped in plastic, and used within a couple of 
days.<p></p>

<h3>Prep <small>&amp;</small> Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; As with other choys, 
wash thoroughly, particularly at the base of the stems. You need not 
separate the leaves from the stems except for stems larger than 1/2 
inch. Even stems up to an inch across need little lead time over the 
leaves.<p></p>
