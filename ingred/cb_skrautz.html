<h1>Sauerkraut</h1>
<br><img src="img/cb_skraut02f.jpg" alt="Shreds of Viterol Polish Sauerkraut" class=mrg>
[Kapusta Kwaszona (Poland); Kvashenoyi Kapusty (Ukraine); Kvashenaya 
kapusta (Russia); Sauerkraut (German, English); Zuurkool (Netherlands); 
Chocrute (French); Liberty Cabbage (North America during World War I), 
Victory Cabbage (North America during World War II)]
<p>
Sauerkraut is cabbage that is salted to a precise degree and allowed 
to ferment, pressed under its own brine, through several generations 
of bacteria until it reaches a desired degree of sourness from a final 
lactic acid fermentation. It is then refrigerated or canned to stop 
further fermentation. It is usually shredded before fermentation, but 
In some cases it is made with lengthwise wedges of cabbage rather than 
shredded. It is also made using whole heads, especially in the 
Balkan region where stuffed cabbage rolls are often made with fermented 
whole leaves rather than fresh.</p>
<p>It is very important to the cuisines of Germany, Poland, Russia, 
Hungary, Netherlands and parts of the Balkans. It is also popular in 
parts of France and Italy that have German exposure. Sauerkraut 
consumption has been declining in North America, which is not 
surprisingly since it is often prepared with little care.</p>

<h2>History:</h2> &nbsp; The standard history places the 
origin of sauerkraut in China, where is said to have been a major supply 
for the building of the Great Wall, to keep the workers from dying at a 
non-renewable rate. It was not the salt fermented sauerkraut we know 
today, because salt was far too expensive to waste on laborers being 
worked to death. It was Napa type cabbage (a turnip green) pickled in 
rice vinegar. The FDA would call this an "acidified product" and the 
name "sauerkraut" could not be applied to it.

<p>From China it is said to have been adopted by Genghis Kahn for his 
invading armies of Mongols, who carried it to Europe. I find this 
questionable, since these were nomadic herding people, not cabbage 
growers, and sauerkraut is rather heavy by weight and <u>very</u> light 
in calories - rather suboptimal for fast moving armies on horseback.
The Mongoles did penetrate parts of Hungary, but only launched a few 
raids agains Poland and Lithuania, and never touched Germany at all.</p>

<p>This story is also severely undermined by Roman authors Cato 
(234 BCE - 149 BCE) and Columella (4 BCE - 70 CE). Both mention 
preserving cabbage and turnips with salt - long before Genghis Kahn 
(1142 - 1227), and the Mongols didn't get to Europe until well after 
his death. I suggest Poland as a possible point of development for 
sauerkraut as we know it today. Huge salt mines have been in operation 
in Poland since ancient times. While salt was very expensive in most 
of the ancient world, it was easily available in Poland.</p>

<p>Kimchi is a Korean salt fermentation very similar to sauerkraut. It 
was originally made mostly from salted radishes, with Napa Cabbage coming 
into use around 900 CE. It is now most often made from Napa cabbage, with 
plenty of spicy chili flake (not all kimchi contains cabbage - or chili). 
In 2012, China banned import of Korean Kimchi in favor of its own Pao cai, 
which has a much milder fermentation.</p>

<p>In Captain Cook's day (late 1700s), British ships carried barrels of 
sauerkraut to ward off scurvy (a vitamin C deficiency). The British later 
switched to limes but German and Dutch ships continued with sauerkraut. 
French and Spanish ships used potatoes for this purpose.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Sauerkraut 
is available fresh and raw in the refrigerated section of many 
supermarkets, either in bags or jars. Fresh in jars, like Bubbies, is 
flash heated to about 140&deg;F/60&deg;C, which kills a lot of the 
bacteria, so it isn't precisely "raw". Pasteurized sauerkraut will be on 
the shelves in metal cans or in glass jars. The two forms are 
interchangeable in most recipes, but the fresh is higher in vitamin C 
and digestive enzymes (see <a href="cb_skrautz.html#health">Health &amp; Nutrition</a>). 
Of course, if you cook it, it's no better than the Pasteurized type. 
Fresh sauerkraut will keep refrigerated for 3 months or so. In the jar 
it should be used within a year because it slowly darkens to an 
unappetizing color.<p></p>

<p>Various Polish brands are now widely stocked by specialty and ethnic 
markets in North America. The photo specimen is Polish Vitarol brand, my 
favorite because it's packed with plenty of brine. These are put up in 
glass jars and most are pretty good. American brand Claussen 
(refrigerated) is excellent and fresh, though I consider it rather  
costly for cooking. I have seen references to fresh Bubbies brand in the 
jar, but I haven't seen it anywhere I shop, and US 2015 $9 for a 25 ounce 
jar seems a little high for cabbage when Vitarol is $2.25 for 31.7 ounces. 
The German brand Gundelsheim Barrel is highly thought of, but I've 
never seen it here in Southern California.</p> 

<p>Just because sauerkraut is in a refrigerated bag rather than a jar 
doesn't mean it's better. Back in 2001 Trader Joe's sauerkraut in the 
bag was absolutely awful - my opinion, which was shared by the Los 
Angeles Times Test Kitchen. Libby's Crispy Kraut is considered quite 
good at the economy end. Franks Quality Kraut is considered among the 
best American made brands, but is somewhat regional in availability. 
The fresh in refrigerated bags recently appeared in one of the markets 
I shop at, so I can confirm it is very good, and very evenly shredded. 
I have not seen the canned version here. In years past I used many jars 
of Meeter's Wisconsin Kraut, but Stokeley has discontinued that product. 
Of course you don't have to buy sauerkraut, it's not hard to make in 
5 and 10 pound batches, but is best made in a cool climate. not in 
Sunny Southern California.</p>

<h3>Prep <small>&amp;</small> Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Sauerkraut, 
either fresh or from a jar, does not need to be cooked. I have eaten many 
pounds of sauerkraut (and Korean kimchi) straight from the jar. It is 
often cooked, generally in a simple way. Cooking time depends on whether 
a soft or crispy result is desired. Our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/inding.html#kraut"><b>Recipes by Ingredients</b></a> 
section has some excellent sauerkraut recipes. Note that the FDA 
recommended salt level is a bit high, so some sauerkraut may need to 
be lightly rinsed to make it less salty for some recipes. The brands I 
have used have not need to be rinsed.<p></p>

<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2>
<p>Sauerkraut is low in calories and high in calcium and magnesium. It 
is a very good source of folate, iron, potassium, copper, manganese and 
dietary fiber, as well as being a source of vitamins C, B and K, and 
the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. The fermentation process 
improves bioavailability of nutrients over the original raw cabbage.</p>

<p>For nutrition, there is a great difference between fresh raw 
sauerkraut (the refrigerated sort) and Pasteurized sauerkraut in 
unrefrigerated cans or jars. Fresh, raw sauerkraut has more vitamin C, 
enzymes, and live lactic acid bacteria cultures that are beneficial to 
digestion and may even relieve lactose intolerance. Of course, these 
advantages are lost if you cook it.</p>

<p>Current research shows raw sauerkraut to be a powerful immune booster 
and cancer fighter, particularly for breast cancer. Raw sauerkraut was 
used during the American Civil War to significantly reduce deaths from 
smallpox among prisoners of war, and it has recently been found effective 
against avian flu in birds.</p> 

<p>Since sauerkraut is high in fiber and has plenty of vitamins but is 
very low in calories, it has endeared itself to a number of top models 
and other celebrities. They can eat plenty of it without gaining a pound. 
No need to jam their fingers down their throats after pigging out.</p>
