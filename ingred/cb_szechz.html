This is a salt fermented pickled vegetable made from the lower stems of a 
mustard cultivar with strangely swollen stems. This variety appeared in 
Sichuan provence and first became popular there, but it is now also used 
in other cuisines of Southern China. It is very salty and needs to be 
rinsed thoroughly before use. The photo specimens, purchased out of a tub 
in a Los Angeles Asian market, were about 3 inches in 
diameter and weighed 8-3/4 ounces each.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Some of the larger Asian markets in Los Angeles 
occasionally have this in bulk tubs, but generally you will find it put 
up in 14 ounce red and yellow cans. Around here they are White Rabbit 
brand, but others report My Ling brand.  The cans may contain whole 
stems or shredded, check the label. They are now also appearing in 
vacuum bags.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or from a can, it'll keep a couple weeks 
in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Unopened cans will keep more 
than a year.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Slice and/or cut to the form you wish to use, then 
rinse it thoroughly in warm water to reduce the salt somewhat. It'll still 
be pretty salty.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This vegetable is used both raw and cooked in 
various recipes, but most commonly in soups. It is used sparingly because 
of its saltiness and distinctive flavor.<p></p>
