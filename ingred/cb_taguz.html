   This choy is a mildly mustardy turnip green with an unusual growth 
   pattern. It is very flat with the long stemmed spoon shaped leaves growing 
   horizontally from the center.</p>
   <p> The photo specimen, purchased from an Asian 
   grower in Los Angeles, was 18 inches in diameter and only about 4 inches 
   high, weighing 14 ounces. The photo below shows an asymmetrical bunch with 
   the stems more exposed. Tatsoi is widely described as a cross between 
   regular bok choy and shanghai (baby) bok choy, but I can not confirm that.   
   I find this a fine general purpose choy. Give the stems a head start 
   over the leaves when cooking.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This choy is less common than most 
but is becoming more widely available in markets serving East and 
Southeast Asian communities, at least here in Los Angeles. Don't look for 
it in markets flat as it grows, it's always bundled up tight and bagged 
so it looks very stemmy, though the top photo specimen was bought at a 
farmers market and was displayed unbagged and flat.
<p>Look for nice crisp leaves, but if slightly wilted you can refresh it 
by shaving off the bottom and standing in a inch of water in a cup or 
bowl for an hour or two. Shake dry, bag loosely and refrigerate - it'll 
keep up to a week if really fresh, then start to yellow.</p>

<h3>Prep &amp; Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; As with other choys, wash thoroughly, 
particularly at the base of the stems. Tear the leaf end from the stem so 
you can give the stems about a 2 minute head start when cooking so they 
are tender without cooking the leaves to death.
