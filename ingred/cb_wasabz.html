[Japanese Horseradish; <i>Wasabia japonica</i>]
<p>
This very pungent green fleshed root is used grated as a condiment, 
particularly to accompany sushi. Most sushi lovers, however, have never 
tasted wasabi. Pretty much all sushi bars in the US and nearly all in 
Japan serve a fake wasabi made from 
<a href="cb_hradz.html">Horseradish</a>, mustard seeds and green food 
coloring. Real wasabi (hon-wasabi) has a more refined hotness, a sweet 
after-taste and is not nearly so bright a green as the fake. It's also 
very expensive and the flavor is extremely perishable.</p>

<p>Imported "wasabi" purchased as tiny cans of dried powder or tubes of 
paste is all faked up from horseradish. The Japanese can export 
horseradish under the name "wasabi" because the Japanese name for 
horseradish is "seiyo wasabi" (Western wasabi). They can even call it "
real wasabi".</p>

<p>Several companies set up wasabi production in North America. At first 
they expected to export it to Japan, but local demand has been so great 
there's little left to export. Two grades are grown in North America: 
sawa-wasabi (semi aquatic - for culinary use) and oka-wasabi (field 
grown - for the nutritional supplement industry). Fresh product is 
available from these growers (see below for suppliers). &nbsp;

<h3>Fresh Wasabi Rhizomes:</h3> &nbsp; These are a phone or Internet 
purchase direct from the grower - expect to pay for 2nd day air or better 
and US $100 to $150/pound. Pacific Farms has stopped selling rhizomes 
but they are still available from Real Wasabi and Pacific Coast Wasabi. 
Wrapped in damp paper toweling inside a bag these can be kept 
refrigerated for up to 30 days, otherwise, freeze.
<p>To prepare, grate on a very fine grater. Traditionally this is a piece 
of shark skin but a very fine ceramic or stainless grater will work. 
Quickly gather the grated paste into a ball and cover tightly with 
plastic wrap. Let sit that way for about 8 minutes to develop flavor, then 
serve immediately. After 20 minutes the flavor will start to rapidly 
decline. It can be restored to some extent by remixing and rewrapping. 
Some say a pinch of sugar will help.</p> 

<h3>Wasabi Paste:</h3> &nbsp; (This product was formerly supplied by 
Pacific Farms) Paste looses its strength rapidly at room temperature so 
it must be shipped frozen - again 2nd day air or better. It must be kept 
frozen until needed, then refrigerated. There have been complaints that 
this wasabi is difficult to squeeze out of the tube, but you can always 
cut off the bottom of the tube and squeeze it out that way. So-called 
"Wasabi paste" imported from Japan is a chemical stew based on 
horseradish - but it squeezes easily.<p></p>

<h3>Dried Wasabi:</h3> &nbsp; This form is problematic because normal 
drying pretty much destroys the flavor. Freeze drying works much better, 
but the product is still very perishable. It will last a year 
refrigerated in a tightly sealed container away from light. Real Wasabi 
seems to be the main supplier of this form. That imported from Japan is 
all fake, made of horseradish, mustard and dye. Preparation is easy - 
just mix equal volume of powder and water into a paste and let sit 10 
minutes to develop flavor. Again, it should not be prepared until just 
before use.<p></p>
