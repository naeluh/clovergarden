<p>
   Watercress, native to Europe and Western Asia, has been cultured and 
   eaten since prehistoric times. Its relatively mild mustardy bite is 
   a welcome addition to green salads and in sandwiches, but it's also 
   used cooked in soups and other recipes. Depending on how it was grown 
   and cut some of the stems can be quite large. All but the largest can 
   be used along with the leaves as they are hollow, tender and have much 
   the same flavor as the leaves.<p>
   <p>Watercress has historically been an important green in Ireland and is 
   still fairly widely used there, but Asian immigrants have greatly increased 
   demand in North America.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Look for bunches that are crisp, with moderate size 
stems and particularly watch out for yellowing leaves. Here in Los Angeles 
watercress is sold in banded bunches typically 7 inches long and weighing 
between 4 and 5-1/2 ounces. Thickness of the thicker stems varies widely. 
In the Asian markets the bunches tend to be larger and the price lower 
than in other markets, due to volume.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; A slightly wilted bunch can be revived by cutting 
off the bottom 1/4 inch of the stems and standing in a cup of cold water 
in a cool place for 20 minutes or so. Wrap loosely in plastic and store 
in the refrigerator. Watercress is very perishable and even a good bunch 
will be yellowing in two or three days.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Watercress is very often used raw, but if not, 
cooking should be minimal. Watercress is typically added to soups and the 
like in the last minute or two. Watercress is always cooked in Chinese 
recipes because they don't use raw vegetables there - for reason.<p></p>
