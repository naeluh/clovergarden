<h1>Yu Choy &nbsp; - &nbsp; Oilseed Rape</h1>

<p>The plants on this page are all edible varieties of Oilseed Rape, a 
kind of mustard plant. A genetically engineered version produces the seeds 
from which Canola oil is made  (Canola is a low erucic acid rapeseed oil, 
originally known as Lear oil). While most rape grown worldwide is used to 
produce oil and animal feed, the edible varieties are very fine vegetables 
and are now widely available in North American markets serving Asian 
communities. They are particularly noted for the sweetness and tenderness 
of their stems.</p> 


<h2>Yu Choy &nbsp; - &nbsp; Regular</h2>

[Oilseed Rape, Chinese Spinach;  Pak Kwang Tung Dok (Thai); Pak kaat som,

<i>Brassica napus</i>]
<p>
This is the commonly available variety of this family of plants, now 
available in most Asian markets. It is an excellent vegetable, particularly 
for stir fries because it cooks quickly and the stems, if not large, don't 
need to be separated from the leaves.</p>

<p>Flower heads are normal. Unlike Western broccoli they are not bitter 
and do not indicate the plant is past its prime. They are cooked right 
along with the leaves and stems. It doesn not keep long, larger leaves 
will start to yellow in a few days.</p>

<p>Some refer to Yu Choy as "Chinese Spinach", but that's not very 
accurate. Yu Choy does have a touch of sharpness but very much milder, 
and the flavor is definitely of the mustard family. The Thai name means 
vegetable from Guangdong, China, with Dok as a qualifier - there may be 
sub-qualifiers to that.</p>

<h2>Yu Choy Mui</h2>

This is the "mui" version of regular Yu Choy. It matures at 
a relatively small size. Mui Choys are popular because they are 
smaller and more tender, and can be cooked in different ways from 
the full size. These would be a candidate for steaming whole.

<p>
Yet another variety of Yu Choy, this one with maroon stems. It is very 
popular in the Chinese state of Hubei, but is still very rare here in 
Los Angeles. It can be used very much like the regular yu choy, which 
makes an acceptable substitute. I have seen photos from Hubei showing 
that it is grown quite large there. The maroon skin is peeled off the 
large stems and left on for the thin ones and flower heads. It is often 
steamed, which is the main cooking method in Hubei but is also stir 
fried. The leaves may be used in a different recipe from the stems.</p>
<p>This is a winter vegetable, and if planted in the spring it will bolt 
too soon. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2020 US $2.99 / pound. They were up to 
18 inches long with stems up to 0.6 inches.</p>

<h2>Yu Choy, Humong</h2>

[Oilseed Rape, Yu Choy, Yau Choy (China); <i>Brassica napus</i>]
<p>
This uncomon variety was obtained from an Asian grower in Los Angeles. 
The photo specimens were 13 inches tall with stems about 3/4 inch 
diameter at the base. This variety was very sweet, but not as sweet as 
the Mongolian variety.</p>

<h2>Yu Choy - Mongolian</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cb_yumong02g.jpg" alt="Mongolian Yu Choy Stalks with Leaves" class=mrg>
[Oilseed Rape; Yu Choy, Yau Choy (China); <i>Brassica napus</i>]
<p>
I don't know if they actually grow this in Mongolia, but it's 
definitely a less civilized cultivar than regular Yu Choy. 
Regular Yu Choy is quite sweet, but this is even sweeter - the stems 
are practically like candy. Unfortunately it is not yet common even in 
Los Angeles. The photo specimens were 25 inches tall with stems about 3/4 
inch diameter at the base. They were obtained from an Asian grower in Los 
Angeles, and he's the one who told me it was called Mongolian Yu Choy.

<h2>Wa Wa Choy</h2>

[Oilseed Rape, <i>Brassica napus</i>]
<p>
This is certainly a very strange version of Yu Choy (and very rare). The 
photo shows a single stem, 2-1/8 inches wide at the base, with smaller 
stems branching from it and very little leaf, yet this huge stem cooks 
up quickly and very tender. It is just a touch fibrous at the skin, but 
by no means does it need peeling. The stems are quite sweet, but not 
cloyingly so. It can be sliced up and used in any recipe where Yu Choy 
is appropriate, only the texture will change, Be careful not to overcook. 
</p>
<p>The photo specimen, purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles 
was 11-3/4 inches high and weighed 1 pound 11 ounces. Its rarity is 
reflected in the price of US $2.78 per pound. It stores fairly well 
refrigerated, some of the larger leaves will yellow, but you aren't 
going to loose a lot there.</p>

<img src="img/cb_yuchoy2k.jpg" alt="Yu Choy, Cooked" class=mrg>
Cooked Yu Choy is a lot "stemmier" than other choys because the broad 
leaves are very thin, but don't worry, the stems are very tender, 
slightly sweet and very good eating. I recommend this vegetable alone 
or with chicken and pork, but not beef, which could overwhelm the 
delicate flavor.<p></p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This choy is now fairly common in 
markets serving East and Southeast Asian communities and at farmer's 
markets which include an Asian grower. The yellow flower heads do not 
become bitter and are perfectly edible.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If fresh, this Choy will keep about 6 days in 
the fridge, loosely bagged in plastic. If slightly wilted when purchased, 
just cut the bottom 1/2 inch off the stems and stand in cold water for 
1/2 hour or so. Yu choy recovers very well.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; As with other choys, wash thoroughly, particularly 
at the base of the stems. Separating leaves from stems so the stems can 
start cooking first is optional with this choy, and it is often steamed 
whole. Generally I do separate leaves from stems because I use the 
thicker parts of the stem as well as the thin. I then cut the stems 
diagonally, shorter at the thick end and longer at the thin end.
<p>The Mongolian variety has thicker, more fibrous stems. Any over 1/4 
inch should be cut into relatively short lengths and any over 1/2 inch 
should not be cooked, but can be eaten raw as a snack.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This choy cooks very quickly when steamed or in 
stir fries, so be careful you don't overcook it.<p></p>
