<h1>Cactus</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
It's hard to imagine that cacti (family <i>Cactaceae</i>) are 
descended from magnolias, but they are, like all flowering plants. 
Cacti are strictly New World plants - the one exception is suspected of 
being recently introduced to Africa by migratory birds. They are all  
members of order <i>Caryophyllales</i>, the <a href="cn_carnation.html">
Carnations</a> - now is that weird, or what?</p>

<p>Cacti are specialized to survive under very hot arid conditions. 
The stem has become a water storage tank while the leaves have been 
morphed into sharp spikes to keep thirsty animals at bay. The root 
system is wide and shallow to take quick advantage of any rain that 
falls.</p>
<p>Cacti are now planted as curiosities and decoratives worldwide, 
but some are grown for food, particularly in the Southwest US, down into 
South America where cactus has been on the menu for thousands of years. 
The photo is of a baby Saguaro (say "sah-wah-roh") about 6 years old 
and just 21 inches tall (yes, it has papers).</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><img src="img/cc_pereskiat01h.jpg" alt="Leafy Cactus" class=mrg>
The cacti we are familiar with today evolved from a leafy plant, probably 
very similar to the <i>Pereskia grandifolia</i> in the photo. The 
<i>Pereskia</i> has already developed tufts of viciously sharp cactus 
spines all over it's stems, so it's not so long a reach to become a 
cactus. Just swell the stems, move the chlorophyll back into them and 
lose the leaves.</p>

<p>Since there are no cacti native to Europe or Africa, they must have 
first appeared less than 40 million years ago after the continents were 
well separated.</p>

<p>The first European contact with a cactus was during Columbus' first 
voyage, and he took one home as a curiosity, as many others have since. 
Prickly pear cactus was taken to Australia in the 19th century to use as 
natural fences and to establish a cochineal dye industry, and they have 
since become a serious pest there.

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>There are thousands of species of cactus, in fact I must have about 40 
of them just here around the house, but this page will consider only those 
that are used for culinary purposes or otherwise ingested.</p>

<h2>Dragon Fruit</h2>
<br><a href="cc_dragz.html">
<img src="img/cc_dragon02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Dragon Fruit" class=mrg></a>
[Red Pitaya, Night blooming Cereus, Than long (Vietnam), 
<i>Hylocereus undatus</i>]
<p>
These cactus are native to Mexico, Central and South America but are now 
grown commercially throughout Southeast Asia, southern China and northern 
Australia and Hawaii, but particularly in Vietnam. In Southern California 
the fruit is most commonly found in Asian markets - and in other parts of 
the country it is found in expensive gourmet restaurants.</p>
<p>There are other <i>Hylocereus</i> species which produce similar fruit, 
particularly <i>H. costaricensis</i> (Costa Rick Pitaya) which is red with 
red flesh and <i>H. megalanthus</i> (Yellow Pitaya), a South American 
species that produces a yellow fruit with white flesh.

<h2>Tunas</h2>
<br><a href="cc_tunaz.html">
<img src="img/cc_tunasrg01e.jpg" alt="Red &amp; Green Fruit" class=mrg></a>
[Prickly Pear fruit, Beles (Ethiopia / Eritrea), Tzabar (Israel), 
Ficodinnia (Italy), <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>]
<p>
While there are many species of <i>Opuntia</i>, <i>ficus-indica</i> is 
by far the most economically important. Because it spread so widely so 
quickly it's exact point of origin was long uncertain, but recent DNA 
evidence shows it was domesticated from wild species native to central 
Mexico. It is known that <i>Opuntia</i> fruit were being eaten in 
Central America at least 9000 years ago.  Today crops are grown 
throughout their original New World range and in arid regions of North 
Africa, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Israel and southern Italy.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century this fruit was being imported into the US 
from Sicily and other Mediterranean countries for consumption by recent 
Italian and Greek immigrants, but its use faded out in the 1950s. Today 
it is back, but imported from its land of origin, Mexico, for consumption 
within our large and growing Mexican immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Aside from eating the fruit, the cactus pads are eaten as Nopales. 
The fruits also have antioxidant and other medicinal value and an 
extract of the fruit skins has been shown effective in preventing 
alcohol hangover. The fruit are also used to make a number of alcoholic 
beverages.

<h2>Nopales</h2>
<br><a href="cc_nopalz.html">
<img src="img/cc_nopal02h.jpg" alt="Cactus pads" class=mrg></a>
[Prickly Pear pads, <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>]
<p>
Nopales are the cactus pads (technically <i>cladodes</i>) of the same cactus 
that produces the Tuna fruit. This is an important vegetable in they dryer 
regions of Mexico and Central America where most vegetables won't grow. 
The photo specimen in the center was 11 x 5 inches, 3/8 inches thick in the 
middle and weighed 7-1/8 ounces. Pads that fall from the cactus to the 
ground will sprout roots wherever they touch the ground and will start a 
new cactus plant.</p>

<p>In the US Southwest fresh nopales are available in produce markets, 
generally in two forms: whole pads (nasty spines and all) and pads prepared 
and cut into short strips. In other parts of the country these strips are 
available canned, and will work in recipes.

<h2>Peyote</h2>
<br><img src="img/cc_peyote01h.jpg" alt="Peyote cactus" class=mrg>
[Mezcal Button, <i>Lophophora williamsii</i>]
<p>
Native to southwestern US down to central Mexico, this psychoactive cactus 
has been used in religious ceremonies by indigenous Americans for over 
6000 years, perhaps as much as 20,000. In US Federal law its use in 
"bonafied religious activity" by native peoples only is protected by law. 
State jurisdictions may permit religious use by other groups or may not.</p>
<p>Psychological studies have shown long term use of peyote to be far less 
damaging than alcohol, in fact it may be beneficial, but such real evidence 
has never influenced government officials who build lifelong careers 
fighting the never ending "war on drugs".
