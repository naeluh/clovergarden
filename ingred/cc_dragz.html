[Red Pitaya, Night blooming Cereus, Than long (Vietnam), 
<i>Hylocereus undatus</i>]
<p>
These cactus are native to Mexico, Central and South America but are now 
grown commercially throughout Southeast Asia, southern China and northern 
Australia and Hawaii, but particularly in Vietnam. In Southern California 
the fruit is most commonly found in Asian markets - and in other parts of 
the country it is found in expensive gourmet restaurants.</p>
<p>There are other <i>Hylocereus</i> species which produce similar fruit, 
particularly <i>H. costaricensis</i> (Costa Rick Pitaya) which is red with 
red flesh and <i>H. megalanthus</i> (Yellow Pitaya), a South American 
species that produces a yellow fruit with white flesh.

The photo shows several dragon fruit cacti growing in a commercial 
plantation, probably in Vietnam. The fruit at the ends of the fronds is 
still green and very immature. &nbsp;

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Dragon Fruits can most commonly be found in 
markets serving a Southeast Asian community, as most imported come from 
Vietnam. In Southern California they are shrink wrapped to a foam tray, 
two fruits to a tray, and placed in the fresh fruit section. Very large 
ones may be displayed loose in bins. Look for fruit where the leaves are 
still green which indicates freshness.<p></p>

<h3>Eating:</h3> &nbsp; Dragon fruit is considered best chilled. You can 
cut the fruit in half lengthwise and just eat the flesh with a spoon or 
cut into wedges which will not need a spoon. The flesh is foamy and sweet 
- the rind is not eaten.

<h2>Golden Dragon Fruit</h2>

[Yellow Pitaya; <i>Hylocereus megalanthus</i>]
<p>
This South American Dragon Fruit species has started to appear here in 
Los Angeles (late 2018). The taste and texture is much like the Red 
Pitaya. The seeds are larger, but I do not find that a problem. The 
uncut photo specimen was 4.1 inches long, 3.3 inches diameter, and 
weighed 12-1/4 ounces. It was purchased from a large Asian Market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2018 US $7.99 / pound.
