<h1>Nopales - Prickly Pear Cactus Pads</h1>
<br><img src="img/cc_nopal02d.jpg" alt="Prickly Pear Cactus pads" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>]</p>
<p>
Nopales are the cactus pads (technically <i>cladodes</i>) of the same 
cactus that produces the Tuna fruit. This is an important vegetable in 
the dryer regions of Mexico and Central America where most vegetables 
won't grow. The photo specimen in the center was 11 x 5 inches, 3/8 
inches thick in the middle and weighed 7-1/8 ounces. Pads that fall 
from the cactus to the ground will sprout roots wherever they touch 
the ground and will start a new cactus plant.</p>

<p><i>Opuntia</i> cactus were imported into Australia in the late 1800s 
for use as natural fencing and to start a cochineal dye industry. They 
almost took over the continent, rendering 15,000 square miles of 
farmland useless. The moth <i>Cactoblastis cactorum</i> was imported 
from South America and single handedly destroyed the cactus invasion.

<h3>Buying and Storing</h3> &nbsp; In the US Southwest fresh nopales are 
available in produce markets, generally in two forms: whole pads (nasty 
spines and all) and pads prepared and cut into short strips. In other 
parts of the country these strips are available canned, and will work in 
recipes.

<p>Buy whole pads that are bright green and between 8 and 12 inches long. 
Really small pads will cook to mush and larger pads that have turned 
blue-green have tough skins and may be fibrous. Whole pads will keep, 
wrapped in the refrigerator, for a couple weeks as they are still fully 
alive. At room temperature they will lose water and start to shrivel.</p>

<p>Bags of cut strips should be refrigerated if kept for more than a 
day, and used within a couple days.</p>

<p>Outside the Southwest US, Mexico and Central America you'll probably 
have to buy canned strips, but these should work OK as the canning 
process is similar to the short boiling used to prepare strips for 
recipes.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane Blowtorch</b></a> 
to burn off the sharp spines so you can handle the pads without pain. 
This works best torching from the tip end.</li>
<li>Trim off the thick stem end, and optionally the edges.</li>
<li>With the back edge of your kitchen knife scrape the surface to remove 
  spine roots and any remaining bits of spines. Use the point to cut out 
  any that won't remove and any imperfections. Rinse and wipe well.</li>
<li>Cut into the desired shape. Most common is 3/8 x 3/8 inch square 
  strips between 1 and 2 inches long.</li>
<li>To prepare for use in a recipe, bring well salted water to a boil, 
  stir in nopales and cook until tender but still crisp - 5 to 7 minutes 
  for 3/8 x 3/8 inch strips.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cochineal Insects</h3>
<br><img src="img/cc_cochin02c.jpg" alt="Cochineal Infested Cactus Pad" class=mrg>
If you have your own prickly pear cactus and they have little cotton-like 
puffs on the pads, they are infected with cochineal insects 
(<i>Dactylopius coccus</i>) which will eventually kill them if not 
treated. You can confirm this by scratching a few puffs and observe the 
bright red stain that results.
<p>The female cochineal insects exude carminic acid dye which is gathered 
by scraping off the insects and crushing them. This was the dye used to 
make the British Redcoats coats red, but today it is used as a natural 
food coloring (carmine, cochineal extract, natural red #4), and in 
lipstick and other cosmetics.</p>
<p>Presuming you don't want to start a dye factory, small infestations 
can be handled by scraping the insects off the pads. For larger 
infestations spray a normal dilution of malathion with some dish washing 
detergent added to assure the spray penetrates to the insects.
