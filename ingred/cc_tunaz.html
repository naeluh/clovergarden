<h1>Tuna - Prickly Pear Fruit</h1>
<br><img src="img/cc_tunasrg01d.jpg" alt="Nopales Cactus Fruit (cut and whole)" class=mrg>
[Prickly Pear fruit, Beles (Ethiopia / Eritrea), Tzabar (Israel), 
Ficodinnia (Italy), <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>]
<p>
While there are many species of <i>Opuntia</i>, <i>ficus-indica</i> is by 
far the most economically important. Because it spread so widely so 
quickly it's exact point of origin was long uncertain, but recent DNA 
evidence shows it was domesticated from wild species native to central 
Mexico. It is known that <i>Opuntia</i> fruit were being eaten in Central 
America at least 9000 years ago. Today crops are grown throughout their 
original New World range and in arid regions of North Africa, Ethiopia, 
Eritrea, Israel and southern Italy.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century this fruit was being imported into the US 
from Sicily and other Mediterranean countries for consumption by recent 
Italian and Greek immigrants, but its use faded out in the 1950s. Today 
it is back, but imported from its land of origin, Mexico, for consumption 
within our large and growing Mexican and Central American immigrant 
communities.</p>
<p>The fruits also have antioxidant and other medicinal value and an 
extract of the fruit skins has been shown effective in preventing alcohol 
hangover. The fruits are also used to make a number of alcoholic 
beverages. The photo specimens were about 2-7/8 inches long, 2-3/8 inches 
diameter and weighed about 5-3/8 ounces each.</p>
<p>The fruits sprout from the edges of the cactus pads, which are also 
eaten as <a href="cc_nopalz.html"><b>Nopales</b></a>.</p>

<p>Tunas are used mainly to make juice, pur&eacute;e and syrups for use in 
drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and various sauces, marinades, 
and deserts. These are available commercially in some parts of the US 
Southwest. Tunas are also eaten raw, just spooned out of their shells, 
particularly dark red ones.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; When in season, these are easily available here in 
Southern California and other regions with a large Mexican and/or Central 
American community. They are plentiful in late summer.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Use your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane 
Blowtorch</b></a> to burn off the spines. Wash the tunas and they're 
ready to go.<p></p>
