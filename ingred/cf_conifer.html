<h1>Conifers</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=lrg>
Conifers (division <i>Pinophyta</i>) first appeared in the Carboniferous 
period more than 250 million years ago</span> and about 100 million years 
earlier than the first flowering plants. While conifers cover vast areas 
of the earth and are of great economic value for wood, paper and pitch, 
few are much used as food.</p>
<p>Conifers are noted for their seed cones (female) and much smaller pollen 
cones (male). Most have long narrow leaves called "needles" but in some 
the leaves are small triangular scales covering the twigs. The seed cones 
often have many scales which may be woody, leathery or paper-like, but in 
other genera the scales are fleshy and fused together so the cone resembles 
a berry.

<h2>Araucaria</h2>
<br><img src="img/cf_araucaria01h.jpg" alt="Monkey Puzzle" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Araucaria</i> of family <i>Araucariaceae</i>]
<p>These are the southern hemisphere equivalent of pines, but are related 
to the northern hemisphere pines only at the order level <i>Pinales</i>. 
A few species, particularly the Monkey Puzzle <i>A. araucana</i> of 
Brazil and Chile and the Bunya-bunya <i>A. bidwillii</i> of Eastern 
Australia are harvested to yield seeds often called "pine nuts" even 
though Araucaria are not actually pines.</p>
<p>The photo shows the densely needled habit of these trees which are 
now widely planted as ornamentals in the northern hemisphere from which 
they have been absent since the demise of the dinosaurs about 65 
million years ago.

<h2 id="ukaz">Ukazi / Afang</h2>
<br><img src="img/cf_eru01h.jpg" alt="Eru Leaves, whole and shredded" class=mrg>
[Eru, African Jointfir (English); Okazi, Ukazi (Igbo); Afang (Ibibio); 
Eru, Okok, M'fumbua, Fumbua (Camaroon); KoKo (Angola, Gabon, Central 
African Republic, Congo); M'fumbua or Fumbua  Democratic Republic of 
Congo; <i>Gnetum africanum</i>]
<p>
Despite being a leafy vine, this plant is actually a conifer, related 
to Pines and Firs.  The leaves are much eaten in West Africa, 
particularly Nigeria. They are all but inedible; tough, glossy, and have 
no flavor except for a slight bitterness. On the other hand, they are 
quite nutritious with a good protein suite, and are strongly medicinal. 
They must be finely shredded and or shredded and ground for cooking, 
which is often done by vendors in the markets. They are used in Afang 
and Okazi/Ukazi soups, as well as some other vegetable soups. The seeds 
can also be cooked and eaten. The root tubers are used as a famine food 
similarly to yams.

<h2>Junipers</h2>
<P>[genus <i>Juniperus</i> of family <i>Cupressaceae</i> (cypress)]
Junipers, ranging from tiny shrubs to medium size trees, are found 
throughout the Northern Hemisphere in some 50 to 67 species (depending on 
which botanist you wish to believe). Some have short needles and others 
have their twigs covered with tiny triangular scale-like leaves. A number 
bear cones that can be used for flavoring, two of which are described 
here. The female cones are comprised of just a few fleshy scales 
which are fused together to resemble berries.</p>

   <h3>Common Juniper</h3>
   <br><img src="img/cf_juniper01e.jpg" alt="Juniper Berries on Branch" class=mrg>
   [<i>Juniperus. communis</i>]
   <p>This cold climate shrub or small tree is native from Alaska across 
   Camada to Nova Scotia, but only in scattered places in the United 
   States. It is also native from northeastern Span through Central 
   Europe and across Siberia to Japan. There are scattered populations 
   in Italy, Greece, northern Anatolia, the Caucasus and the Himilayas. 
   It provides the juniper "berries" of commerce and those used to flavor 
   most gin. The leaves are moderate length needles and the three fleshy 
   scales of the cones are fused together to resemble a berry. These 
   cones are too bitter to eat raw and are generally sold dried for use 
   as a flavoring. They should be crushed when used to release the 
   flavors.

   <h3>Eastern Juniper</h3>
   <br><img src="img/cf_junipe03e.jpg" alt="Eastern Juniper with Berries" class=mrg>
   [Eastern Redcedar, <i>Juniperus. virginiana</i>]
   <p>Often just a shrub at the edges of its range, this juniper can be a 
   tree large enough to cut for lumber in the Southeastern USA. It is 
   native from Nebraska to southern Maine, and south to Georgia, 
   but avoids the coast in its southern range. It is planted as a 
   decorative in many other parts of the United States. This is a "scale 
   leafed" juniper with twigs covered in tiny triangular green leaves, 
   but juvenile plants have short needles which may also appear on shaded 
   twigs of mature plants. The scales of the cones are fleshy and fused 
   into a "berry" as with the Common Juniper but the cones are lumpier 
   in shape and covered with a white wax which makes them a sky blue 
   color. As with the Common Juniper these cones are used to flavor 
   gin but are not commonly sold as a commercial spice.

<h2>Pines</h2>
<br><a href="cf_pinez.html">
<img src="img/cf_pine02h.jpg" alt="Pine Cone, Needles &amp; Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[genus <i>Pinus</i> of family <i>Pinaceae</i> (pines)]
<p>
Pine nuts (officially a seed, not a nut) have been eaten since prehistoric 
times in Europe, Asia and North America. Today the sweet resinous seeds 
are somewhat costly and used mostly as a flavoring ingredient but Italian 
pesto sauce is often based on pine nuts (other nuts are also used).</p>
<p>Pine nuts from a number of species are available. In Europe it's 
mostly the Stone Pine (<i>Pinus pinea</i>) and in Asia the Korean Pine 
(<i>Pinus koraiensis</i>) and Chilgoza Pine (<i>Pinus gerardiana</i>). 
Siberian Pine (<i>Pinus sibirica</i>) and a number of other varieties 
are also used. In North America seeds of various species of Pinon pines 
(subgenus <i>Ducampopinus</i>) are harvested.</p>

<p>The soft layer between pine bark and the wood is also edible and has 
been used as a famine food. Pine needles are sometimes used as a 
flavoring. For more details and culinary usage, see out page 
<a href="cf_pinez.html"><b>Pines &amp; Pine Nuts</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Spruce</h2>
<br><img src="img/cf_sprucered01h.jpg" alt="Live Red Spruce with Cones" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Picea</i> of family <i>Pinaceae</i>]
<p>The many species of spruce are of great economic importance throughout 
the Northern Hemisphere for lumber, paper making and as Christmas trees, 
but have little culinary application. Buds and needles of young growth are 
used as a flavoring, mainly for beer in areas too far north for hops to 
grow, and sap of a few species is used locally to make a gum. The photo 
shows foliage and cones of Red Spruce (<i>P. rubens</i>), one of the species 
used to make spruce beer. <small>Photo USDA (public domain)</small>.
