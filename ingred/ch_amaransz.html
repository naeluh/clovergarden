There are at least 70 species of Amaranth, and some of them produce 
seeds of sufficient size and quantity to be harvested and used similarly 
to grains. These seeds are eaten in various parts of the world, and are 
seeing a resurgence in the Americas after Spanish suppression. Listed 
above are species most noted for producing edible seeds, which are 
very similar to <a href="ch_quinoz.html"><b>Quinoa</b></a> seeds.

<p>The most important seed amaranths are native to the American 
tropics, but are now grown worldwide. Amaranth was of great importance 
to the Incas because it grew well in the high mountainous regions of 
Peru and was highly nutritious. It has more recently become of some 
importance in the Himalayan region of Asia for similar reasons.</p> 
<p>Spanish conquerors of Peru were very disturbed by amaranths use 
in a ritual too close to Christian communion for comfort, and banned 
its cultivation. The crop has recently gone back into production because 
of its nutritional attributes, and it is now widely available. It is 
slowly escaping from the "health food" market into the mainstream, 
though not as quickly as Quinoa.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Amaranth seeds are gradually escaping the 
Yuppie and "health food" markets and are increasingly available in the 
multi-ethnic markets that abound here in Los Angeles. Markets that 
carry the Bob's Red Mill line of products often have it.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Seeds should be kept in a tightly sealed jar, 
away from light and as cool as possible. Under these conditions it will 
keep for about a year. Once ground into flour it is highly perishable and 
should be kept refrigerated and only for a few days - preferably grind as 
needed.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Amaranth is high in protein and 
that protein is nearly perfectly balanced for human consumption. Wheat, 
rice and corn must be accompanied by beans to balance the protein content 
but that isn't necessary with amaranth. Amaranth is also gluten free and 
can be freely eaten by people with a gluten intolerance (celiacs). 
Amaranth seed is thought to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol 
levels.<p></p>
