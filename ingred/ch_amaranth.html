<h1>Amaranth Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Amaranth family (<i>Amaranthaceae</i>) has been reorganized under 
APG II to include <i>Chenopodioideae</i> (Goosefoot subfamily) and is a 
member of order <i>Caryophyllales</i> 
(<a href="cn_carnation.html">Carnations</a>) This family provides us 
with a broad range of roots, greens, herbs and seeds. Amaranths grow well 
at high altitudes, in cold and uncertain climates, and on difficult land.
</p>
<p>The Incas depended on amaranths for survival in their harsh, high 
altitude lands but they have been important in other parts of the world 
as well, particularly in the Slavic countries (beets in particular). 
Many species of the <i>Amaranthoideae</i> subfamily are also grown for 
their highly decorative flowers.

   <p>
   <i>Amaranthus</i> is a worldwide genus of leafy herbs. There were 
   once distinct American and Asian species, but some Asian species 
   and some American species are now worldwide food crops. African 
   species are not as widely dispersed. Amaranth greens are similar to 
   spinach in use but not as fragile so tolerate rougher handling and 
   longer cooking times. They are less tart than spinach and tend to 
   be slightly mucilaginous, so they have a thickening effect in soups.

   <p>
   Amaranth was of great importance to the Incas because it grew well 
   in the high mountainous regions of Peru and was highly nutritious. 
   It has more recently become of some importance in the Himalaya region 
   of Asia for similar reasons. Spanish conquerors of Peru were very 
   disturbed by its use in a ritual too close to Christian communion for 
   comfort, and banned its cultivation. The crop has recently gone back 
   into production because of its nutritional attributes and it is now 
   widely available.

   While its African origin is disputed, this plant, very similar to 
   Amaranth, is much used in West and Central Africa as greens. Young 
   flower heads are also often incorporated with the leaves. It is also 
   eaten as greens in Southeast Asia, South America and the West Indies. 
   Fancy decorative varieties have been developed with complex flower 
   heads.

   According to a large Tanzanian vegetable wholesaler, "mchicha" applies

   "traditional spinach". This may be Chard.

   [<i>Beta vulgaris</i>]
   <p>
   A cultivated variety developed for edible roots, red beets are 
   particularly appreciated in the Slavic countries but also throughout 
   Europe and North America. The color comes from a purple pigment, 
   betacyanin, and a yellow pigment, betaxanthin, which are acid stable 
   so beets can be pickled. Beets are high in boron, a mineral important 
   to production of human sex hormones, and have had an aphrodisiac 
   reputation since Roman times. Beets are very sweet with a sugar 
   content that can reach 10%. The photo specimens were typically 3-1/2 
   inches in diameter, weighed 11 ounces each, and provided an additional 
   7 ounces of edible greens and stems.

   [<i>Beta vulgaris</i>
   <p>
   This cultivar is useful when you need to avoid the red pigments of 
   regular beets getting all over everything. I find them a little less 
   sweet and having less beet flavor than red beets so I'd use them only 
   when the color is important. For cooking see

   <h2>Beet - Chioggia</h2>

   <p>
   This Italian beet, named for a town near Venice, is sweeter than any 
   but the sugar beet. From the outside it looks like a red beet, but 
   internally it has alternating layers of red and white giving it a 
   candy stripe appearance. The colors run together a bit when cooked.

   <h2>Beet - Sugar</h2>
   <br><img src="img/ch_sugarbeet01c.jpg" alt="Sugar Beets" class=mrg>
   [<i>Beta vulgaris</i>]
   <p>
   While it was long known sugar could be obtained from beets, beet sugar 
   production didn't really start until the Napoleonic wars when the 
   British cut off cane sugar deliveries to Europe. Sugar beets produce 
   sucrose, nearly identical to sugar from cane, and have a sugar content 
   as high as 20%. I say "nearly identical" because beet sugar has been 
   shown not to work as well for Cr&egrave;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e.

   [Swiss Chard, Silverbeet, Spinach Beet; <i>Beta vulgaris</i> var. 
   <i>cicla</i>]
   <p>
   This is a variety of beet greens developed for edible leaves, and is a 
   vegetable deserving of wider appreciation. It is available in several 
   colors, some of which are shown in the photo, but red and white are 
   most common in markets. Leaves are cooked similar to spinach and the 
   stems similar to asparagus. The photo specimens were about 15 inches 
   long, but they can exceed 18 inches. There are varieties with thinner, 
   more tender stems, but those marketed in North America are uniformly 
   of the wide stemmed varieties.</p>
   <p>Although never much grown in Switzerland, these greens were called 
   "Swiss Chard" after a Swiss botanist, to differentiate them from 
   Cardoons, which were also called "Chard". Cardoons are no longer 
   called Chard, so the "Swiss" part is now redundant.

   <p>
   This is what Indian recipes mean by "spinach". Popular varieties 
   are Pusa All Green and Pusa Jyoti. &Uuml;ber-expert Julie Sahni 
   recommends using the closely related 
   <a href="ch_chardz.html"><b>Chard</b></a> in any Indian recipe calling 
   for "Spinach". If you can't get Perpetual Spinach Chard (see below) 
   use    a white stemmed version of regular chard for correct color. If 
   you don't have chard Julie recommends chopping in one small green bell 
   pepper per pound of regular spinach to improve the flavor, but chard 
   is very common in North American markets now.

   </p><p>
   It isn't spinach, and it's not perpetual, but it's probably the ideal 
   substitute for Indian Palak (see above). Milder than regular spinach, 
   it's of particular value in warmer climates because it's far slower to 
   bolt in warm weather. Large lower leaves can be harvested frequently - 
   in warmer climates even through the winter. It will definitely bolt 
   (send up a flower stalk and stop producing large leaves) in the second 
   year. It is not common, even in farmer's markets here in Southern 
   California, but seeds are easily available for gardeners.

   also in parts of Africa where it has been introduced. It is easily 
   recognized by the leaf shape and the white powdery underside of the 
   leaves, which repel water. The leaves and young shoots are used in 
   soups and curries, similarly to spinach, but the flavor is different 
   and the leaves are tougher. It produces copious seeds, which are high

   flour. They don't have the coating of bitter saponins that must be 
   removed from Quinoa before cooking, but that makes them vulnerable 
   to birds, further incentive to harvest at the vegetable stage. One 
   popular recipe uses Huauzontle bound with flour and molded around a

   [<i>Spinacia oleracea</i>]
   <p>
   A native of Southwest Asia, spinach is delightful, if properly handled 
   and cooked, but is easily abused. Many people know it only as a stringy 
   lump of overcooked mush. Cultivars are Savoy, the most common fresh 
   spinach, Smooth Leaf, used for frozen and processed spinach (easier to 
   wash) and Semi-savoy, a sort of all-purpose spinach. <b>Baby 
   Spinach</b> is sold in plastic bags and boxes for the yuppie salad 
   trade - just about all the leaves are the almost flavorless oval form.
   </p>

   <p>Spinach's reputation for very high iron content was due to an 
   analyst slipping a decimal point in 1870, not corrected until 1937. 
   It still has a higher iron content than most vegetables but not by 
   so spectacular a measure. Spinach is also high in calcium but a high 
   oxalate content inhibits absorption of both calcium and iron into the 
   body. On the other hand it is high in Vitamins A, C and E, folic acid 
   and antioxidants.

   not confuse this spinach with Water Spinach (Swamp Cabbage) often called 
   "Chinese Spinach" by recipe writers. That is a very different plant, 
   in the morning glory family.

   This succulent shrub, native to the Mediterranean Basin, grows to about 
   2-1/4 feet high, and is so salt tolerant it can be irrigated with 
   seawater. It was once very important to the production of glass, but is 
   now of only culinary value, particularly in Italy. It can be eaten raw, 
   but is more commonly simmered until it is crisp tender, sometimes with 
   bacon and onions. It is said to taste much like spinach, but more 
   interesting. It is also used as a companion plant for tomatoes and 
   peppers when they are grown in salty soil, as it desalinizes the 
   soil.

   <p>
   A salt tolerant plant that grows near the sea, samphire has long been 
   gathered and eaten in salads or pickled, particularly in England. It is 
   usually steamed or simmered, then the flesh is pulled off the fibrous 
   core. Dressed with butter or olive oil, it is said to taste similar to 
   young spinach stems or asparagus. It is very salty, so cooked without 
   salt. It is not to be confused with Rock samphire 
   (<i>Crithmum maritimum</i>) mentioned by Shakespeare - while used 
   similarly that one is not an amaranth.

   This wetlands plant is native to both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of 
   North America from Canada to Mexico, living in salt marshes. It also 
   lives in the alkaline flats of Utah, near salt springs in New York, 
   and in the alkali marshes of Manitoba, Canada. It is usually just 
   blanched for 1 minute so it is still crunchy, then dressed as a salad. 
   It may also be used in stir fries and the like, or pickled.

   Native to Eurasia, this plant now appears in grasslands and desert 
   shrub environments in North America. In Japan, it is popular in large 
   decorative plantings for its green and red colors. In Akita Prefecture, 
   the seeds, called "Tonburi" are specially prepared as a food garnish. 
   It is described as "Land Caviar", "Field Caviar" and "Mountain Caviar" 
   due to its similar texture. The seeds are dried, boiled, soaked and 
   then hand rubbed to remove the skin.

   [Russian Thistle, Windwitch, Saltwort; <i>Salsola tragus</i> of 
   subfamily <i>Salsoloideae</i>]
   <p>
   Now symbolic of empty spaces in the American West, tumbleweeds were 
   actually brought over by Ukrainian farmers with flax seed, thus the 
   more formal name, Russian Thistle. Please note that many Ukrainians 
   may take offence at being called "Russians". It took the plant only 
   about 25 years to spread from South Dakota to the Pacific Coast. The 
   plant is roughly spherical and in the fall it dries and breaks off 
   the root to be driven many miles by the wind, scattering seeds the 
   whole way. Tender leaves and shoots of freshly sprouted plants are 
   eaten in salads, stir fries, or as pot herbs. They are safe in 
   moderate quantity but have too much oxilate and nitrate to be a 
   major culinary item.</p>

   <p>Back in the late 1950s, every vacant lot in Burbank California was 
   overgrown with tumbleweeds. People would spray paint dried ones white 
   and stack them up to make Southern California snowmen around Christmas 
   time. Today they have been so thoroughly eradicated I had to buy a 
   picture of one for this page - but then, the vacant lot has also been 
   eradicated from Burbank.

   <p>
   Locally called "Chicken Feet" for obvious reasons, this salt tolerant 
   plant is native Sri Lanka and the east cost of India north to Bengal. 
   It is cooked and eaten as a green, and also pickled.  This plant is 
   currently under intensive study in Karala in southern India to 
   develop solutions for South Asian farmers whose fields will be 
   contaminated with salt water as global warming raises sea levels.
   In appearance, it is the same as <i>Salicornia europaea</i>, so 
   we used a photo of <i>S. Europaea</i> as we found no suitable photos 
   of <i>S. brachiata</i>.

<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Amaranth greens all have similar health considerations differing 
only in degree. While they are high in iron and calcium they are also 
high in oxalate which partially inhibits absorption of those nutrients 
by the body. They are, however, also rich in vitamins A, C and E, folic 
acid and antioxidants which the oxalate does not inhibit.</p>

<p>Other than absorption, oxalate can contribute to formation of kidney 
stones and gout. It is only one of many contributing factors and probably 
not the strongest, but it's probably not a good idea to make these 
vegetables a major part of your diet.</p>

<p>Edible amaranth roots and seeds do not carry significant amounts of 
oxalate.</p>

<p>Amaranth greens are high in nitrates so it may not be wise to reheat 
them as leftovers. Bacteria which grow under high nitrate conditions 
produce enzymes that convert nitrates to nitrites. Nitrites can be 
dangerous to infants less than a year old and particularly less than 6 
months old. Older children and adults are not bothered by small 
quantities of nitrites.</p>

<p>Nitrites can form into possibly carcinogenic nitrosamines in the 
stomach, but the level of risk, if any, is not established. The 
conversion is inhibited by vitamin C, which is strongly present in 
amaranth greens.</p>
