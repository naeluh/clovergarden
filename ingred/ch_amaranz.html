<h1>Amaranth - Greens</h1>

<p>There are at least 70 species of Amaranth, and many of them are eaten 
to at least some extent in various parts of the world. Listed here are 
species most likely to be encountered in North America, which are also 
the most common worldwide. For seeds see our 
<a href="ch_amaransz.html"><b>Amaranth Seeds</b></a> page.</p>

<h2>Asian Amaranth</h2>
<br><img src="img/ch_amaran08f.jpg" alt="Asian Amaranth Stems with Leaves" class=mrg>
[Chinese spinach; Red Spinach (markets);  Pak khom (Thai); 
Kilitis, Kulitis, Kalunay (Philippine); Chua, Chaulai, Harive, Cheera 
(India); Bayam (Malaysia); Hinn Choy, Hen Choy, Yin Tsoi (China), 
<i>A. dubius</i>, <i>A. tricolor</i>]
<p>
Originating in South or Southeast Asia, these Amaranth greens are now 
grown and eaten through much of the world. The photo specimens were 
obtained from a market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) serving a mixed 
Vietnamese / Chinese community, but it is also very popular in parts 
of India, Sri Lanka and the Caribbean. It is similar to spinach in 
use but not as fragile so it accepts rougher handling and longer 
cooking times. In addition to being a lot less tart, it's 
somewhat mucilaginous so it has a thickening effect.</p>

<p>Amaranth roots are also nutritious, and used in soups in China, 
Vietnam and Nigeria, but are not found in North American markets. 
Greens and roots have significant medicinal uses.

[Quelite Quintonil (Mexico); Green (Nigeria); Efo Tete, 
Tete eleegun (Yoruba); Aleho, Allayahu (Hausa); Inine (Igbo); 
Common Amaranth, Red-root Amaranth, Redroot Pigweed; 
<i>Amaranthus hybridus</i> syn. <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>]
<p>
Originating in the tropical Americas, these Amaranth greens are now 
grown and eaten through much of the world's tropics. They are one of 
the most popular greens in West Africa. The photo specimens were 
purchased from a market in Los Angeles (Burbank) specializing in 
Mexican, Central American and South American foods. The bunch was 
about 15 inches long and weighed 12 ounces. Yield of edible leaves 
was 4-1/4 ounces (34%). </p>

<h2>Green Amaranth</h2>
<br><img src="img/ch_amaranv01e.jpg" alt="Green Amaranth, Growing Plant" class=mrg>
[Slender Amaranth; Cheng-kruk (Manipur, India); Kuppacheera 
(Karala, India); Note Shak (Bengal); Tanduliya (Sanskrit); 
Callaloo (Jamaica (name used for other greens elsewhere)); Massaagu 
(Maldives); <i>Amaranthus viridis</i>]
<p>
This widely distributed plant is an important culinary green in South 
Asia (India, Maldives, Bangladesh) and Africa. The seeds are also 
used in those regions, and are easier to harvest than those of most 
Amaranths. They have a nutty taste and are used as snacks, in biscuits 
and porridges.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Asian Amaranth greens are almost always in 
stock at markets that serve a Southeast Asian community (at least here 
in Southern California), but are not yet common in the Indian markets. 
They are sold fresh in plastic bags. Depending on the market, they may 
weight between 16 ounces with moderate sized stems to nearly 3 pounds 
with stems up to 1/2 inch diameter. They cost about 2016 US $1.29 per 
pound.

<p>The American Amaranth greens are still difficult to find, but are 
available in some Hispanic specialty markets. </p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Wrapped loosely in plastic the leaves will 
keep for about four days in the fridge.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; I float wash the stems as I would spinach, then 
pinch  off the leaves and tender tips (leave behind the leaf stems too, 
as they are fibrous). I then remove all free water by spinning in my 
salad spinner.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Amaranth is quite stemmy. Yields I have 
experienced have been up to 43% for particularly leafy Asian, and 
around 34% for American.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This green is cooked in many ways, sometimes as 
a recipe ingredient and sometimes just as greens. When cooking a big bunch 
as greens, the cooking water is usually discarded because of the oxalic 
acid content, and sometimes high nitrate content (depending on soil).
<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Amaranth greens 
contain an unusual amount of manganese and magnesium, as well as plenty 
of iron and phosphorus. They also contain significant amounts of calcium, 
zinc, selenium and potassium. They are also noteworthy for Vitamin E and 
B complex, and a high amount of protein for a leafy green. Oxalic acid 
content may somewhat inhibit absorption of the zinc and calcium. While 
the oxalic acid content is much lower than that of spinach, it is still 
recommended that people suffering from kidney problems, gout and 
rheumatoid arthritis avoid this green.<p></p>
