[<i>Beta vulgaris</i>]
<p>
A cultivated variety developed for edible roots, red beets are 
particularly appreciated in the Slavic countries but also throughout 
Europe and North America. The color comes from a purple pigment, 
betacyanin, and a yellow pigment, betaxanthin, which are acid stable so 
beets can be pickled. Beets are high in boron, a mineral important to 
production of human sex hormones, and have had an aphrodisiac reputation 
since Roman times. Beets are very sweet with a sugar content that can 
reach 10%. The photo specimens were typically 3-1/2 inch in diameter, 
weighed 11 ounces each, and provided an additional 7 ounces of edible 
greens and stems.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> If you intend to use the greens or use the beets raw 
select small ones which will be more tender. If the beets will be well 
cooked you could use larger ones but much above a pound you risk them 
becoming stringy.

<p>When buying beets without leaves, make sure they have some stem stubble 
at the top end, and preferably with root still on. Beets trimmed without 
any stem stubble have probably been in storage way too long and have lost 
flavor. They will also bleed out their color during cooking.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Cut the greens down to about 1 inch and keep in 
a refrigerator crisper, unwashed and unwrapped or wrapped loosely in 
paper. They'll last several weeks.<p></p>

<h3>Greens:</h3> Beet greens are edible, particularly when young. Tender 
ones can be used raw in salads, larger ones stir fried or saut&eacute;d in 
oil or with bacon.  They are similar to spinach but can stand much longer 
cooking without becoming mushy.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> In most cases beets are cooked separately from what 
they will eventually be used with. Some swear oven roasting is the only 
way to go, but I find little difference from boiling, and in sunny 
Southern California we don't fire up a hot oven if we don't really need 
to. The skins are easier to rub off if the beets are boiled.
<ul>
<li><h3>Boiling:</h3> &nbsp; Leave at least an inch when you cut off the 
  greens, do not scrub and do not cut off the root. Boil until cooked 
  through - a thin metal skewer will pass through the biggest one without 
  hitting a hard spot in the center when they are done. Drain, cool in 
  cold water until you can handle them and and rub off the skins. If you 
  want the beets to stay warm, take them hot and rub off the skins under 
  cold running water so you can handle them.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Roasting-1:</b> &nbsp; Wrap the beets tightly in foil and bake 
  them in a preheated oven at 375&deg;F/190&deg;C, 1-1/4 hours for 3/4 
  pound beets. When they are done, cool them enough to handle them and 
  and rub off the skin.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Roasting-2:</b> &nbsp; Cover a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat 
  the beets with olive oil and place on the foil. Fold the foil up over the 
  beets and seal at the top. bake them in a preheated oven at  
  375&deg;F/190&deg;C, 1-1/4 hours for 3/4 pound beets.</li>
