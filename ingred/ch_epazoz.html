<p>
A common weed in southern Mexico, Central and South America, Epazote is 
now grown in the warmer parts of North America and sometimes becomes an 
invasive weed here. Its main culinary use is for flavoring black beans 
and to a lesser extent other recipes from southern Mexico and Central 
America. It is reputed to prevent flatulence from eating beans and to 
relieve a number of medical conditions. An oil extracted from the seeds 
kills intestinal worms and is also an antispasmodic and abortifacient.

<p>The smell of epazote is quite strong but extremely difficult to 
describe. Leading spice expert Gernot Katzer says it smells to him like 
epazote.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; If you live in an area where there are a lot of 
immigrants from southern Mexico and Central America, you'll find this herb 
available erratically in markets that cater to them. Otherwise, you need 
to grow it yourself. If you live in a reasonably warm climate, that's easy 
- it grows enthusiastically and you may end up fighting it as a common 
weed. It is quite seasonable so will not always be available.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If fresh, it will keep loosely bagged in the 
refrigerator for maybe 5 days. Dried epazote is considered "satisfactory" 
if it is fairly fresh.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; There isn't anything close. Savory is often 
suggested because it goes well with beans but the flavor is very 
different.<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; In large quantities epazote is 
toxic (as are many medicinal plants), but in the amounts used as a flavoring 
herb no adverse effects have been reported.<p></p>
