<h1>Mchicha</h1>
<br><img src="img/ch_amarana01f.jpg" alt="American Amaranth Greens" class=mrg>
[Mchicha (Swahili); Terere (Kikuyu); subfamily <i>Amaranthoideae</i> 
&nbsp; -or- &nbsp;  subfamily <i>Chenopodioideae</i>]
<p>This is a very important green in Tanzania and Kenya, but what is it 
actually? According to a large Tanzanian vegetable wholesaler, "mchicha" 
applies to both Amaranth Greens and Spinach Greens. "Spinach" is also an 
uncertain word, applied to various greens worldwide that may or may not 
be related to our North American Spinach.</p>

<p>A very reliable Tanzanian recipe writer calls for "Large-Leaf Spinach" 
claiming it as a cousin of "traditional spinach". This may be Chard. Another 
East African recipe writer also tried, and failed, to find an English or 
botanical name, but she did publish photos, which look most to be white 
stemmed Chard. Many other writers call for Spinach, with photos that look 
like our spinach, but many others firmly identify the greens as Amaranth, 
and cooking times given vary greatly. Mchicha may be all of these, and all 
are members of the Amaranth family (<i>Amaranthaceae</i>), so it's all OK.
</p>

<p>As for Amaranth, that big Tanzanian wholesaler says Amaranth was brought 
from the Americas, but I see no reason Asian Amaranth might not also be 
present in East Africa. For cooking, they are quite interchangeable. I would 
favor Amaranth over Spinach as it holds up better in African recipes, which 
tend to be stews, but greens are also served minimally cooked and lightly 
seasoned.<p>

<p>Chard is very popular in North Africa and South Africa, so I see no 
reason it wouldn't also be used in between. Certainly it would grow better 
in the Equatorial East African highlands than our regular spinach, which 
likes cool weather. I wouldn't hesitate to use white stemmed Chard, which 
is widely available in North America. Here in Los Angeles it's just a short 
drive get either Asian or American Amaranth Greens, but Chard is everywhere. 
The photo at the top is American Amaranth.</p>
