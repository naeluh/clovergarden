<h1>Chili Powders <small>&amp;</small> Flake</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg><b>Chilis</b> (<i>Capsicum</i>) are a powerful Genus of 
the Nightshades.</span> Originating in South America, they have become 
essential flavoring ingredients for most of the cuisines of the world, 
especially in the hotter regions. They don't lose their power when 
dried (though they lose a lot of vitamin C), so they are often dried 
for long storage, and ground into powder or flake for more convenient 
application to foods. There is no limit whatever to which varieties 
can be dried and ground, though some with thick flesh or a tendency to 
rot quickly are best dried in a dehydrator rather than in the sun.

<h2 id=buy>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Powder <small>&amp;</small> Flake</h2>

<p>Buy chili powders and flake from a reliable source with high turnover, 
usually an ethnic or multi-ethnic market - or grind your own. The little 
whirling blade coffee grinders are perfect for grinding dried chilis.</p>

<p>Chili powders and flake are perishable, but with proper storage they 
will last at least a year. Store in a well sealed spice jar kept away 
from heat and direct sunlight, which will destroy powders quickly. If 
you notice a color change (getting less red), discard and replace.</p>

<h2 id=var>Varieties</h2>

<p>Our list covers mostly chilis and powders you are likely to find 
available for purchase in the North America, (particularly California) 
or which are important to a particular cuisine.</p>

<p>The chilis pictures and the hotness ratings 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H#</b></a>) are mostly from Southern California and 
Mexican grown examples. Results may differ elsewhere. <b>Caution:</b> 
The heat ratings are typical, but actual variation is wide depending on 
soil, the perversity of chili plants - and imprecision in labeling. 
Always test to avoid disappointment (or devastation).</p>

<h3>Aji Amarillo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [<i>C. baccatum</i> var. <i>pendulum</i>]
<br><img src="img/cp_ajiamaril09c.jpg" alt="Aji Amarillo Powder" class=mrg>
<p>In Peru this chili is usually used fresh, but in neighboring Bolivia 
it is most commonly used as dried powder. This powder is orange in color 
and moderately hot at about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>. 
I have yet to see this powder here in Los Angeles, but dried whole 
chilis are available from Latino markets, so I just grind them in my 
spice grinder.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="alep">Aleppo</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [pul biber (Turkey (flake pepper)); <i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<br><img src="img/cp_alepexh01c.jpg" alt="Aleppo Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Aleppo Mild powder, hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a> 
is certainly one of the finest low heat powders available. It is much 
sweeter, tastier and a little hotter than American paprika. Aleppo Extra 
Hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>) is also available, and 
while hotter still has excellent flavor. These chilis are grown in northern 
Syria and are suitable for Lebanese, Turkish and Persian cooking. The 
photo is of "extra hot", the samples of sweet I've encountered have been 
a bit more maroon in color. &nbsp; <u>Subst:</u> For Aleppo Extra Hot, real 
<a href="chilip.html#paph"><b>Hungarian Hot Paprika</b></a> will work. 
<a href="chilip.html#korea"><b>Korean Flake</b></a> (not powder) is less sweet and 
somewhat hotter. For Aleppo Mild, a real <a href="chilip.html#paph"><b>Hungarian Sweet 
Paprika</b></a>, with a tiny bit of hotter chili powder. 
Aleppo Extra Hot makes an excellent substitute for Indian <a href="chilip.html#kash">
<b>Kashmir</b></a>, which is much harder to find in North America.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id=cal>California Chili Powder</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_calp01c.jpg" alt="California Chili powder" class=mrg>
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; this comes two ways - American and Mexican. The 
American is a seasoning blend, generally made from California or New 
Mexico chilis, cumin, cayenne, oregano, salt, onion powder and/or garlic 
powder. The Mexican will be plain ground California chilis and will list 
no other ingredients, and be around <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2">
<b>H2</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cayenne</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_cayene01c.jpg" alt="Cayenne Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a> a distinctly hot 
powder, usually without much flavor, Cayenne is the "standard" for adding 
heat to recipes without greatly affecting the flavor, including adding 
heat to California and New Mexico chili powder mixes. Sometimes it's 
made from actual Cayenne chilis but more often not. It varies in color and 
is often of a duller and less red color than the version in the photo which 
was made by one of the big Mexican chili companies.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chili Powder - Generic</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_japonf02c.jpg" alt="Japone Chili Powder" class=mrg>  
<p>[Chinese Chili Pepper; Tien Tsin (China); Hontaka, Santaka, (Japan); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>China exports vast quantities of Chili Powder marked just "Chili 
Powder", without any indication of type. It is mostly from Japone type 
chilis or chilis of very similar heat and taste characteristics and 
hotness, about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6 - H7</b></a>. The 
specimen to the left is Japone powder.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chipotle</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_chipotp01c.jpg" alt="Chipotle Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Ground chipotle chilis (smoked jalapenos). It has a stronger smoke flavor 
than Spanish smoked paprika and is considerably hotter 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Erjingtiao Chili Flake</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_erjngf02c.jpg" alt="Erjingtiao Chili Flake" class=mrg>  
[Er Jing Tiao; Two Vitex; <i>C.annuum</i>]
<p>Preferred for Chili Oil and Chili Broad Bean Paste in Sichuan, this 
unique chili has a strong aroma and taste, but moderate heat. &nbsp; 
<u>Subst</u>: <a href="cp_mexiz.html#pasilla"><b>Chili Negro</b></a> 
has almost the exact same heat, though is a darker color. It is similarly 
aromatic, but noticeably sweeter. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Habanero / Scotch Bonnet / Cameroon</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_camer04c.jpg" alt="Cameroon Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>This powder is popular in the Caribbean and West Africa, made from dried 
yellow Habaneros or Scotch Bonnets. These chilis are not easy to dry, but 
the weather in northern Cameroon is suitable. I make my own, drying orange 
Habaneros in an electric dehydrator. Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h10">
<b>H10</b></a>, an extremely hot powder, with fruity Caribbean flavor. 
I like this powder, and keep a salt shaker full near the table, so I can 
"adjust" dishes I've had to make too mild because of guests. An almost 
invisible sprinkle does the job.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>India Extra Hot</h3> 
<br><img src="img/cp_indext06c.jpg" alt="India Extra Hot Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>This is the hottest, up to <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>, 
of the chili powders sold in the Indian markets here in Southern 
California (Paprika, Kashmir, Reshampatti and India Extra Hot). It is about 
as hot as Cayenne with better flavor than most Cayennes. Use it for the 
cuisines of southern India and on the west coast from Goa on south, or 
wherever Cayenne is called for. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Khandella</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Medium Hot]
<br><img src="img/cp_khandela02c.jpg" alt="Fine Khandela Flake" class=mrg>
<p>This chili powder, actually usually a fine flake, is a bit less sweet 
and somewhat hotter (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>) than 
Kashmir, and a good choice for all-around Indian cooking where you don't 
want too mild or too hot. It is one of my favorites for all-around use in 
many cuisines.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="kash">Kashmir</h3> - [Kashmiri Mirch (India)]
<br><img src="img/cp_kashp07c.jpg" alt="Kashmir Chili Powder" class=mrg> 
<p>Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>. Kashmir chili powder 
is widely used in Indian cooking, particularly in the relatively softly spiced 
meat dishes of the north. It is rarely made from actual Kashmiri chilis, which 
are in very short supply, but from other mild, intensely red chilis, 
particularly Byadgi / Byadagi. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: <a href="chilip.html#alep">
<b>Aleppo Extra Hot</b></a> makes an excellent substitute for Kashmir and is 
more available in North America. Aleppo Mild is a little too mild and a lot 
sweeter, but some may prefer it, or add a dash of hotter chili. Expatriate 
cooks from India often recommend real <a href="chilip.html#paph"><b>Hungarian Sweet 
Paprika</b></a> with a dash of Cayenne for hotness.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="korea">Korean - Flake and Powder</h3>
 &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Gochu-garu (flake); Gochujang-yong-gochu-garu (powder)]
<br><img src="img/cp_korea05h.jpg" alt="Koran Flake and Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Hotness of the flake varies, but is usually between 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a> and 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>, sweet and tasty. The powder 
tends to be quite a bit more variable, and can be as low as 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a> and as high as 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>. Unless you read Korean 
there will be no hint on the package, you have to try it and see. In 
general, for powder, the brighter the red color the milder it will be, 
but that's not totally reliable. Both flake and powder are used liberally 
for kimchi and other Korean dishes, so turnover at Korean markets is 
quick and the product is generally of excellent quality.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Korean Chili Threads</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Silgochu (Korea)]
<br><img src="img/cp_thread02c.jpg" alt="Red Chili Threads" class=mrg>
<p>These threads are used as a garnish for some Korean dishes. They are 
around  <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>, sweet and tasty. 
They used to be laboriously cut with scissors, but it's now done by 
machine. The photo specimens, about 0.019 inch wide and up to 4-1/4 
inches long, were purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles for 
2015 US $14.19 for 6.5 ounces ($34.93 / pound). The weight usd in a 
recipe is minuscule, so 6.5 ounces will last a very long time (they 
didn't have any smaller packages).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>New Mexico Chili Powder</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_nmexp01c.jpg" alt="New Mexico Chili Powder" class=mrg> 
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; This comes two ways, American and Mexican. The 
American is a seasoning blend invented in Texas in the 1800s. It is 
available in mild and hot versions and is generally made from New Mexico 
chilis, paprika, guajillo chilis, black pepper, onion powder and garlic 
powder. Cayenne may be added for hotter formulas. The Mexican will be 
plain ground New Mexico chilis, will list no other ingredients, and 
be around <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Paprika, U.S.</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_paprikaa01.jpg" alt="Supermarket Paprika Powder" class=mrg> 
<p>Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>. Undistinguished to 
slightly bitter in flavor and lacking any heat, U.S. Paprika is pretty 
much for decoration only, but often dull in color too. It is usually 
ground from New Mexico type pods. Obtain genuine Hungarian or Spanish 
paprika if at all possible.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="paph">Paprika, Hungarian, Sweet &amp; Hot</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_paprsw06c.jpg" alt="Hungarian Sweet Paprika Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Hungarian paprika is sweet, flavorful and brilliant red. "Sweet" 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b> to <b>H1</b></a>) and "Hot" 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b> to <b>H3</b></a>) versions are sold. Today, 
when a recipe calls for "paprika" it means sweet - hot is used mainly as 
a "sprinkle" at serving (there are exceptions), but originally all Hungarian 
paprika was hot. Though now the signature spice of Hungarian cooking, paprika 
was little used until after 1850. It is said the technique for grinding chilis into 
fine powder was first developed in Hungary.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Paprika, Spanish</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Piment&oacute;n]
<br><img src="img/cp_paprsps01c.jpg" alt="Spanish Paprika Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Spanish paprika is made from an entirely different chili than the 
Hungarian, coming directly from the New World rather than through Turkey, 
and it has a different flavor. It comes in several versions, including 
Dulce (Sweet), Agridulce (bittersweet), Picante (Hot, about 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>)), Ahumado (Smoked, about 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>)). Hungarian paprikas are 
reasonable substitutes for Dulce and Picante, but the others are unique 
to Spain.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Peri-peri / Pili-pili / Piri-piri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>C. frutescens</i>]
<br><img src="img/cp_periperi01c.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspon Peri-peri Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Made from tiny Bird Chilis, this powder is about as hot as it gets 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). The names above are African 
and Portuguese, but similar Bird Chilis are used in other regions as well. 
Generally you will need to grind this yourself from tiny dried Peri-peri or 
similar Bird Chilis - much hotter than the dried Thai Chilis we get around 
here. Take all precautions - do not breath even invisible amounts of dust. 
The photo specimen was ground from tiny Bird Chilis from India.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Reshampatti</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_resham06c.jpg" alt="Reshampatti Fine Chili Flake" class=mrg>
<p>Though whole reshampatti chilis are not much seen in North America, the 
ground version is very common in Indian markets here. This chili powder, 
actually usually a fine flake, is a bit less sweet and a bit hotter 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>) than Kashmir, and a good 
choice for all-around Indian cooking.
