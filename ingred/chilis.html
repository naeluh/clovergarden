<span class=bg><b>Chilis</b> lend themselves well to the making of 
potions that add flavor and spiciness to dishes of many kinds and in many 
countries. They are particularly useful for vegetarian and tropical

<span class=bg>There are a zillion bottled hot sauces for sale, and every 
hot sauce enthusiast has his favorites.</span> The hottest often have 
names like "Death Sauce", "DOA", "Insanity Sauce" or similar. Here in 
Southern California we even have an anual Hot Sauce Expo, with at least twenty 
exhibitors. While I have attended that show, here I've ignored those 
exotic potions in favor of stuff you can buy at your local grocery at 
reasonable prices.

<p>How hot a hot sauce you want to use on what varies by individual and 
is highly subjective, and many of you probably don't want to ask me 
anyway (I drank that bottle of Tapatio straight in 4 days. Some of the 
others were hit pretty hard too, and half the Pickapeppa was gone within 
2 hours). All sampling and comparisons were done by licking big dollops 
off the palm of my hand (well washed to assure purity).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tapatio</h3><small>&reg;</small> is a simple, low cost 
hot sauce, but clearly well liked. It's found on the tables of 
practically every Mexican restaurant west of the Mississippi. It was 
developed and marketed by a laid-off aerospace engineer, starting with 
a couple dozen bottles a week - it's one of the great Los Angeles success 
stories.  Not real hot as hot sauces go (about 
<a href="chili.html#hot">H4</a>), it's made from water, unspecified 
red chilis, salt, spices, garlic, acetic acid, xanthan gum and sodium 
benzoate. It goes extremely well with Tortilla Chips.<p></p>

<h3 id=cholula>Cholula</h3><small>&reg;</small> has a more complex 
and sophisticated flavor than Tapatio (and it's more expensive). It 
appears on the tables of just about every Mexican restaurant that isn't 
serving Tapatio. The flavor is light and somewhat fruity compared to 
more earthy Mexican sauces. It's pretty mild at around 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H4</a>. Made in Mexico from water, peppers 
(arbol and pequin), salt, vinegar, spices and xanthan gum.

<h3>Tabasco</h3><small>&reg;</small> Green Pepper Sauce has a 
distinctive jalapeno chili flavor and is much milder than regular 
Tabasco at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H3</a>. It's quite tasty 
and excellent for places you want a mild jalapeno flavored hot sauce. 
I've used a liberal dash each of the Tabasco Green and Tabasco Red in 
tomato juice to spice it up before drinking. Made in USA (Louisiana??) 
from vinegar, jalapeno peppers, water, salt, corn starch, xanthan gum 
and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). K.<p></p>

<h3>Tabasco</h3><small>&reg;</small> Pepper Sauce is the traditional 
McIlhenny product made on Avery Island Louisiana for over a century. It's 
decently hot at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H6</a> and owes its 
clean flavor to aging in oak barrels. Tabasco Pepper Sauce was long ago 
adopted as the correct sauce for mixed drinks because of its clean sharp 
flavor and the fact that it contains no oil. Today many sauces have no 
oil, but Tabasco isn't likely to lose its status any time soon. The 
chilis (native to Yucatan, Mexico) are now grown mostly in Central 
America from Avery Island seed. Vinegar, red chilis and salt. K.<p></p>

<h3>Tabasco</h3><small>&reg;</small> Habanero Sauce is the hottest 
of the McIlhenny products at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H7</a>. 
Its habanero flavor is tempered by the traditional Tabasco flavor and 
it's not as hot as you might expect from something labeled "Habanero 
Sauce" because it's "Jamaican Style" with a lot of other flavoring 
ingredients. Made from vinegar, habanero peppers, cane sugar, Tabasco 
Pepper Sauce, salt, mango puree, dehydrated onion, banana puree, tomato 
paste, tamarind puree, papaya puree, spices, and Tabasco pepper mash 
(aged pepper, salt). K.<p></p>

<h3>Pickapeppa Sauce</h3><small>&reg;</small> is a real Jamaican 
hot sauce made in Jamaica for over 80 years. It's much sweeter and 
fruitier than the Tabasco "Jamaican style" Habanero Sauce and not nearly 
as hot at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H4</a>. Aged for 1 year in 
oak barrels, it's an honest and very tasty sauce made from tomatoes, 
onions, sugar, cane vinegar, mangos, raisins, tamarind, salt, chilis 
and spices.<p></p>

<h3>Frank's Red Hot Original</h3><small>&reg;</small> Cayenne Pepper 
Sauce is similar in both flavor and hotness (around 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H5</a>) to what you'd get by blending Tabasco 
Red with Tabasco Green. The label claims it's the original secret hot 
sauce for Buffalo Wings. It's an honest sauce made from aged cayenne 
red peppers, vinegar, water, salt and garlic powder. U.<p></p>

<h3>Goya Salsita</h3> with habanero chilis has real habanero flavor 
and it's pretty hot at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H7</a>, but 
the ingredient list, like those of many Goya products, seem a little 
contrived. Made in Mexico from water, green tomatoes, salt, habanero 
pepper, fresh onion, acetic acid, sugar, xanthan gum, white pepper, 
habanero pepper extract, sodium benzoate, garlic powder, natural 
habanero flavor, monsodium glutamate and turmeric. VK.<p></p>

<h3>Habanero Hot Sauce from Hell</h3><small>&reg;</small> is honestly 
hot at around <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H7</a> and has good habanero 
flavor. "The World's Hottest Hot Sauce" is in quotes indicating it's 
someone's opinion (because it isn't - there are even some so hot they 
can't legally be called "sauces" - they're "food additives"). but it'll 
prove hot enough for most. Even I reached for a hunk of whole wheat pita 
bread after lapping this one up during testing. It's an honest sauce 
made in Arizona from water, habanero pepper, vinegar, carrots, salt, 
xanthan gum, garlic and spices.<p></p>

<h2 id="lcom">More Hot Sauces</h2>
<p></p>
 
<img src="img/cp_hotsauce03.jpg" alt="Bottles of Less Common Hot Sauces" class=mrg>

<p>Again we skip the "Death Sauces" and other pricy and exotic sauces in 
favor of honest products with peasant friendly prices. These are easily 
available in Southern California but may not be easy to find nationally.
</p>
<br class=cll>
<h3>Tamazula</h3><small>&reg;</small> "Extra Hot" is a very fine basic 
Mexican hot sauce and it's made in Mexico. It's more earthy, less fruity 
and hotter (<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H5</a>) than 
<a href="chilis.html#cholula">Cholula</a> and has a touch of smokiness. Made from 
water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt, spices and 0.1% sodium benzoate.
<p></p>
<h3>El Yucateco</h3><small>&reg;</small> "Chile Habanero" (Red and Green) 
<b>You will have no complaint</b> with either of these lacking real 
habanero flavor or hotness (a solid <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H8</a>) - 
they'll make your heart pound and your brow sweat. Hotter'n'ell and real 
flavor so the only thing to complain about is accidentally pouring a lot 
more than you intended from the relatively wide mouthed bottles. Simple, 
straight forward habanero sauces, these are definitely <i>Not</i> 
"Jamaican style" and contain no fruits other than habanero peppers. Made 
in Mexico from (Red) red habanero peppers, water, tomato, salt, spices, 
acetic acid F.D.&amp;C red 40 and 0.1% sodium benzoate. (Green) green 
habanero peppers, water, salt, garlic, spices, acetic acid, F.D.&amp;C 
yellow 5, F.D.&amp;C blue 1 and 0.1% sodium benzoate. VK.<p></p>
<h3>Salsa Huichol</h3><small>&reg;</small> - a sound and simple Mexican 
hot sauce made from natural ingredients grown in the Huichol highlands of 
Mexico (home of famed Huichol shaman Don Jose Matsua). It's thicker and 
more earthy than <a href="chilis.html#cholula">Cholula</a> but about the same hotness 
(<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H4</a>). Made in Mexico from chilipeppers, 
spices, salt and vinegar.<p></p>
<h3>Buffalo</h3><small>&reg;</small> "Chipotle" - A very flavorful dark 
sauce made from chipotle chilis (jalapenos red ripe, dried and smoked), 
it's somewhat sweet, smoky and reasonably hot at about 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H6</a>. Made in Mexico from water, distilled 
vinegar, chilis peppers, salt, sugar, caramel color, spices and 0.1% 
sodium benzoate. Buffalo claims to be "Mexico's #1 hot sauce for 60 
years" and makes several other fine chili sauces.<p></p>

<h2 id="asia">Asian Chili Sauces</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</h3>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_huyfong.html">
<img src="img/sa_huyf02h.jpg" alt="Bottles and Jars of Huy Fong Chili Sauces" class=mrg></a>
We might as well start with the ubiquitous Huy Fong products made here 
in Los Angeles. Not authentic? Well, David Tran, the founder of the 
company, now building a worldwide market which includes Southeast Asia, 
was a Vietnamese refugee after the war. He re-established the family 
busniness here, selling first to our huge Asian population. 
The only "unauthentic" part is that the Huy Fong sauces are made from 
red ripe Jalapeno peppers, because that's what David Tran likes.
<p>Jalapenos didn't grow in Asia until these sauces came out, but you 
can bet they're being grown there now (Serranos are already big in 
Thailand due to influence from our Thai restaurants). Huy Fong is one 
of the great Los Angeles success stories, along with Tapatio hot sauce 
(see above). The three sauces are <i>Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce</i>, 
<i>Chili Garlic Sauce</i> and <i>Sambal Oelek</i>. You will find more 
details on our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a> page.

<h3>Fried Chili Paste</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_frypast02h.jpg" alt="Tiny Dish of Fried Chili Paste" class=mrg>
[Roasted Chili Paste]
<p>
This paste is popular in parts of Thailand, used in soups and salads. 
It has a definite roasted flavor, and is very hot. Plain dry roasted and 
ground chili flake is also used in parts of Thailand. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles for 2017 US $4.99 
for a 10.6 ounce (300 gm) jar. Ing: chili, garlic, red-onion (probably 
shallots), palm oil - product of Thailand.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chili Broad Bean Paste</h3>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sa_pdfavaz.html">
<img src="img/sa_chilibb08h.jpg" alt="Tiny Dish of Broad Bean Chili Paste" class=mrg></a>
[Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang]
<p>In Sichuan, Broad Beans (Fava Beans) are used for sauces instead of 
Soy Beans. This fermented sauce is very important to the cuisines of 
Sichuan and Hunan in southern China. The best are reputed to come from 
the town of Pixian. &nbsp; <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sa_pdfavaz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a>.

<h3>Gochujang Chili Paste</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_gochuj01k.jpg" alt="Blob of Gochujang Paste" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the chili sauce of Korea, one of the three essential ingredients 
in Korean cuisine (the other two are fermented bean paste and soy sauce). 
This is a fermented paste traditionally made from chilis, rice flour and 
soybeans. Today it may be made with wheat flour and grains in place of 
the rice flour, and most don't include soybeans. Processes and 
ingredients vary, resulting in prices at a local Korean market ranging 
from 2013 US $3.99 to $7.99 for a 1.1 pound tub. The photo specimen, 
made in Korea, is made from chili powder, rice, corn syrup, starch syrup, 
salt, alcohol, fructooligosaccharide. Another I have on hand is made 
from wheat flour, wheat grains, chili powder, salt, malt syrup, water.

<h3>Turkish Hot Pepper Sauce</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_hotsaucet.jpg" alt="Jar of Turkish Hot Pepper Sauce" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a moderately hot (<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_hottab.html">H3</a>) chunky paste 
made from hot red chilis and tomatoes. Judging from the shopping cart 
loads going out the door when my local market had a sale on Tukas brand 
(made in Turkey) I'd say it's wildly popular in the Anatolia and Caucasus 
region. particularly in Armenia. Anyway, it's a lot healthier than catsup 
(no sugar).</p>
<p>Ingredients: Hot red peppers, tomato paste, salt, citric acid, sodium 
benzoate, ascorbic acid.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Paprika Paste</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_pappaste01h.jpg" alt="Tube of Paprika Paste" class=mrg>
Imported from Hungary this paste, available in both mild and hot versions, 
is very tasty for use on sandwiches and the like. Red Bell Peppers and 
Paprika Peppers, Salt, Modified Starch, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Potassium 
Sorbate.
