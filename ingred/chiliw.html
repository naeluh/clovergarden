<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>With growing interest in ethnic foods, an increaing emphasis on healthy 
eating, seeking to escape the ever increasing cost of big hunks of dead 
cow, or just wanting a more varied eating experience, use of chili peppers 
is rapidly growing in North America. If you are not already familiar with 
them, here are a few useful hints.</span>

<h2 id="store">Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Chilis</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Fresh Chilis - Green or Red</h3>

<ul>
<li>These should be crisp and bright and without wrinkles when purchased, 
and have no spots that might be going bad.</li>
<li>Leave them out on a counter for a couple of hours to make sure they 
don't have excess surface water, then bag loosly in plastic (the bag 
should be able to breath) or paper. Store in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Bell peppers I bag separately in small bags open at the top. This 
keeps them well and isolates any one that goes to rot.</li>
<li>Stored as above, green bells should keep at least two weeks in a good 
refrigerator, some hot green chilis for three to four weeks. Red ripe 
chilis will generally not keep as long as green ones. There are 
exceptions, such as Thai chilis, where the reds last longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dried Red Chilis</h3>
<ul>
<li>These should be bright red to black red depending on type and should 
be shiny on the surface. A dull surface indicates excessive age. They 
should be somewhat flexible rather than brittle.</li>
<li>If you see the surface become dull or red color fading to orange, or 
evidence of bugs, discard and buy new ones.</li>
<li>Store in a sealed container in a cool place away from light and they 
should keep a year or so.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work">Working <small>with</small> Chilis</h2>

<p>Chilis are used unripe (green, or sometimes other colors), red ripe, 
and dried red. Dried green bell peppers are used as a flavoring additive 
in the food industry. Chilis are at their hottest when mature green and 
about to turn color. Some hotness is lost in drying.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; After working with hot chilis, 
especially fresh ones, immediately wash your hands, tools and work 
surfaces with strong detergent, soap or cleanser. Until then <b>do not 
touch your eyes or genital areas</b> - or anyone else's, if you ever 
want to be allowed to touch them again. If you accidentally do, the 
sting goes away in 10 to 20 minutes and will do no actual harm.
<p></p></li>

<li><h3>I need Releif!</h3> &nbsp; For the mouth, Ice Cream is the 
treatment of choice. Other milk products will help. Water doesn't help 
at all and alcohol very little. For external burn, wash with strong 
soap solution and wait for it to go away. In neither case is any real 
harm being done (unless if you've been eating million Scovile chilis). 
<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Chilis are Safe:</h3> &nbsp; Cookbooks telling you hot chilis 
will severely burn or blister you hands (so wear rubber gloves) are 
either blowing smoke or have extrordinarily tender hands. Exception: 
hands with injuries will feel pain. Chili hotness is a nerve receptor 
thing and does no physical damage. Being a guy who works hard, my hands 
are too tough to have ever felt chili sting, but society ladies or 
fashion models might have hands that tender (but wouldn't likely be 
chopping chilis anyway). Of course, when working with chilis over 
500,000 Scoville, more caution is in order, but you won't be buying 
any like that at your local market.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Cleanup:</h3> &nbsp; The hotness in chilis is oil 
soluble and not water soluble. Just rinsing won't get rid of it, you 
have to use detergents, cleansers or other potions you'd use to clean 
oily things.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Where the heat is:</h3> &nbsp; The hotness of a chili 
resides in oil droplets clinging to the internal membranes that hold the 
seeds, not in the seeds as many cookbooks tell you. If your chili is too 
hot you can cool it by carefully removing these membranes. In a dried 
chili, or one that has been abused, the hotness has been smeared onto the 
seeds and flesh.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Chopping Fresh Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Cut the cap off, 
then cut it in half lengthwise. Remove seeds and membranes if you want 
it milder. Squish each half flat, skin side down, and, with a very 
sharp knife, slice lengthwise into thin strips. Finally, arrange the 
strips into a bundle and slice crosswise very thin. No further chopping 
is required in most cases.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Chopping Dried Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This can be a 
problem. They are tough and don't grind in a mortar and if you try to 
chop them the pieces jump all over the place. If I don't want them too 
small I use a pair of scissors and cut them into thin slices. A couple 
of presses with a knife blade through the stack of slices is probably 
all the chopping you will need. Most of the time, though, I just run 
them to flake or powder in a whirling blade coffee/spice grinder (be 
careful not to breath the dust).</li>
