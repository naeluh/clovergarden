[Etrog (Hebrew), <i>Citrus medica</i>]
<p>
The Citron was the first citrus fruit brought to Europe, thus gave its 
name to the whole genus. Citrons can grow up to 6 inches long but are 
barely edible with a thick lumpy rind and what little flesh they may have 
is dry and full of seeds. The aromatic oils of its thick peel are widely 
used for flavoring drinks, perfumes, etc. The peel itself is often cut 
into strips and candied for use in making fruitcakes - also widely 
considered inedible.</p>
<p>The citron was known during Roman times, at first for medicinal 
purposes, to repel insects and as a perfume, but by the 2nd century CE it 
was being used in cooking as well. It is featured in the Hebrew holiday of 
Sukkot.</p>

<p>[Fingered Citron]
</p><p>
This mutation apparently originated in Northeastern India and is popular 
as a curiosity. It has no seeds and no or very little juiceless flesh. The 
rind is, as with other citrons, highly aromatic. 
In the West the fingers are used as peel would be, but also can be thinly 
sliced for salads and the like. The white pith is not bitter as it is in 
most citrus so can be included with the yellow zest. In Asia it is used 
to perfume rooms and personal items.
