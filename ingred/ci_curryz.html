Essential to the cuisines of Southern India and Sri Lanka this citrus 
leaf has no real substitute and is not worth much dried. Fortunately it is 
now grown in Southern California and can be had fresh from most Indian markets, 
at least around here. They keep only a few of weeks refrigerated. Freeze 
bagged in water to keep them from drying out. The tree bears pea sized dark 
purple fruits but I've not heard of them being used for cooking. They 
have a sweet resinous taste, but not a lot of flesh over the large seed.

<p>In India, curry leaves are used in the cuisines of the south and east 
but not at all in the north. The southern cuisines are primarily vegetarian, 
so curry leaves are rarely used with fish, fowl or meat. In Sri Lanka, 
however, curry leaves are often used in chicken and fish dishes. The leaves 
also see some culinary use in Malaysia, and throughout the region they are much 
appreciated for their medicinal properties.</p>

<p>In West Africa, there is great confusion. Two herbs are called 
"curry leaf", this one and Thai Lemon Basil. Both are used in the 
region. Sometimes you can tell which is meant by how they are used 
in the recipe, and some times you can't. If added to a salad or added 
to a soup when it is nearly done, you can bet on the Basil.</p> 

<p>Note that some people do not like the resinous flavor of curry leaves, 
so it's best to be on the conservative side until you're experienced with 
them.</p>

   <h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Enough curry trees are now grown in Southern 
     California that most Indian markets will have fresh leaves. They 
     are generally put up in small rumpled plastic bags, stems and all, 
     and are found in the produce section.  Commercially dried leaves are 
     sold, but have lost most of their flavor and aroma. I have seen 
     fresh leaves for sale on eBay, but the shipping cost can make them 
     expensive.<p></p>

     <h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; If you live in a tropical or subtropical 
     region the best solution is to grow your own tree - if you can find 
     a nursery that gives you more than a blank stare. They are fairly 
     small, growing only to about 5 feet and can be kept in a 5 gallon 
     container. They want warm weather, full sun or part shade and plenty 
     of water.
     <p> Unfortunately they grow slowly. I bought mine at 3 inches 
     high (that would be about 8 months old). The photo shows them at 
     about 2 years, and they took 5 years to reach 45 inches, They set 
     fruit every year, and though I enjoy the sweet, slightly resinous 
     berry size fruit, setting fruit does stunt their growth 
     significantly. Seeds are easy to sprout indoors, but mortality 
     seems quite high, so you need to plant plenty and tend them 
     carefully.
     <br class=cll></p>
   <h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Leave them on the stems or flavor will 
     suffer. Kept in the plastic bag they came in, curry leaves will stay 
     usable for several weeks in the refrigerator. They will keep longer 
     if frozen, but freeze them in water or they will dessicate rapidly 
     and lose flavor.
   <p>Another method I've used is to dry roast the leaves in a heavy pan 
     over very gentle heat with plenty of stirring and making sure they 
     don't brown at all. They are very tender so this will take only a 
     couple of minutes. Dried quickly this way they stay quite green and 
     hold their flavor well. In a sealed jar kept in a cool dark place 
     they'll be useful for a couple of months.</p>
   <h3>Cooking</h3>: &nbsp; Many recipes call for them to be fried in 
     hot oil at the beginning of the recipe. Fresh leaves will snap and 
     splutter violently for a few seconds, then settle down. Other 
     ingredients need to be added immediately before the leaves brown. 
     If you have dried them as described above, add them later when 
     there is liquid in the pan.
   <p>The leaves may or may not be removed from the finished dish before 
     serving.</p>
   <p>When making curry powders you need to dry roast the leaves as 
     described above, then grind them with the other spices.</p>
   <h3>Substitutes</h3>: Well, there really aren't any. Bay leaves are 
     <u>not</u> an acceptable substitute. The closest you can get is 
     Salam Leaves (Daun Salam, used in Malaysia and Indonesia) which is 
     less camphor and more citrus (even though Curry Leaf is a citrus and 
     Salam is a myrtle). Salam Leaves are far less common in Southern 
     California than Curry Leaves, and are only found dried.<p></p>
