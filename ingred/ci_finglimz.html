[<i>Citrus australasica</i>]
<p>
   The shrubs that produce these limes grow wild in Queensland and 
   New South Wales, Australia, but there is now some cultivation in 
   that region. It is also now being grown on a small scale in California, 
   because of demand from the fancy chef set.</p> 
   <p>This fruit is unique in several ways, other than its shape. The 
   juice vesicles separate completely into tiny beads, described 
   as "citrus caviar". This has become popular as a garnish in expensive 
   restaurants. Finger limes come in a wide range of colors: green, 
   yellow, orange, red, purple, pink, black and brown. The largest of 
   the photo specimens was 2-3/4 inches long, 0.8 inch diameter and 
   weighed 5/8 ounce.</p>

<p>The most common use for these limes in North America is as "citrus 
caviar" garnish applied by high priced chefs. A Finger Lime can be cut 
in half crosswise and all the little beads simply squeezed out intact. 
These vesicles burst with a pop like fish caviar, but the taste of the 
juice is similar to regular limes.</p>

<p>In Australia the first major use was for a boutique marmalade made 
from wild fruit. Demand soon spurred cultivation and work to develop 
superior varieties. Marmalade is still made from them, and they are 
also pickled. The peels are dried to use as a seasoning.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While still not common, these limes are now 
available in some Farmer's Markets here in Southern California. The photo 
specimens were purchased from a Los Angeles (Montrose) Farmer's Market 
for about 2017 US $14.40 per pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Handle the same as regular limes.<p></p>
