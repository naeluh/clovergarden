<p>
Not really a lime, this fruit is native to Southeast Asia and used 
particularly in Thai Cuisine. The odd double leaves are most used, 
often in soups, but the rind of the fruit is used in Thai curry pastes. 
The rind is also used to flavor rum in R&eacute;union and Madagascar. 
Many references say the juice is inedible but I do not find that the case, 
though there isn't a lot of juice in a kaffir lime.</p>
<p>The shrub makes a very nice and useful decorative which can be grown 
in a container, so many nurseries stock them. When fully ripe, the fruit 
turns just a touch yellowish and falls from the tree but it is generally 
used before that stage.</p>

<h3>Buying</h3>: &nbsp; These leaves have recently become much more 
  available in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles They sell for about 
  2016 US $19.99 / pound, but a tray usually contains between 1-1/2 and 
  2 ounces, as not many are needed for most recipes. They may also be 
  available frozen.
  <p>Of course, the best solution is to buy your own tree. Those sold by 
  nurseries are generally on dwarfing root stock so they don't get too 
  big and can be grown in containers. They are evergreen and fruit well. 
  They should be pruned now and then to keep them producing plenty of 
  leaves.</p>
<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Both leaves and rinds are best stored frozen 
  as they are useless dried. In both cases, freeze them submerged in 
  water so they aren't quickly destroyed by freezer burn.<p></p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>: &nbsp; Each stem holds 2 leaves (see photo above). A 
  recipe calling for "4 leaves" means 2 stems. Recipes always use leaves, 
  except recipes for curry pastes which use fruit rinds. Whole leaves are 
  usually used in soups (I recommend crumpling them so they impart more 
  flavor) but stir frys and curries use them rolled up and sliced with a 
  sharp knife into very fine threads. The leaves are not softened by 
  cooking.<p></p>
<h3>Substitutes</h3>: Well, there aren't any, but if you just don't 
  have the leaves, use the grated zest of a regular lime - not the same 
  but at least it's something.<p></p>
