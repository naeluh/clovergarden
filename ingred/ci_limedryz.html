[Black Lime, Black Lemon, Dry Lemon, Amani, Omani (Persia), Loomi, 
Lumi (Arab); Limoon aswad, Leemoo-amanee]
<p>
   These are an important item in the cuisines of Persia (Iran) and 
   countries that have been under Persian influence. Limes are boiled in 
   salt water, then sun dried. Used in lentil, rice or meat dishes they 
   may be crushed or may simply be pierced and added whole to slow 
   simmering dishes to provide tartness and a citrus fragrance. The hard 
   outer shell contains mainly a dry black powder. Size may vary, and 
   color may vary from tan to black.

<p>These limes are essential to the cuinsines of Persia, the Middle East 
and Levant. They can be simply pierced and added to long cooking soups 
or stews, then squeezed out and discarded, or for other uses, especially 
rubs on meats or short cooked recipes, they can be ground to powder. 
Powdered, they are now being used as a mixed drink ingredient at fancy 
bars.</p>
<p>Use the light colored ones for light colored dishes, and the black 
ones for darker dishes.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are available on-line, and from markets 
serving a Levantine or Middle Eastern community. The photo specimens, 
purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland), 
were: Black - 1.6 inch diameter, 1/4 ounce,  2018 US $3.99 for 4 ounces; 
Tan - 1.1 inch diamter, 1/8 ounce, 2018 US $2.79 for 4 ounces.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Whole dried limes will last about 2 years in 
a cool dry place. Ground, they should be used in a couple of weeks as 
their oils will evaporate.<p></p>>
