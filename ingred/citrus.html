<h1>Citrus Family - Rutaceae</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>The highly aromatic <i>Rutaceae</i> family (named for the bitter herb 
<a href="hb_ruez.html">Rue</a>) is a member of the important order 
<i>Sapindales</i>. The most familiar genus is <i>Citrus</i>, and the 
family is often called the Citrus Family. Several other genera have  
a less prominent role in culinary affairs. The common edible citrus 
varieties are all tropical or subtropical and of Asian origin.</span>

[Bengal quince, Golden apple, Japanese bitter orange, Stone apple, 
Wood apple; Ohshit (Burma); <i>Aegle marmelos</i>]
<p>
This medium size tree is native to India, Nepal, the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands, and Burma, as well as naturalized in Sri Lanka, Thailand and 
Malesia.The ripe fruit, up to the size of a Pomello, is yellow when ripe 
and has an extremely hard rind that must be broken open with a mallet or 
machete. The aromatic pulp surrounding the seeds is use both for food and 
medicinally throughout the tree's range. The flavor is similar to 
marmalade made from citrus and tamarind. It is usually used to make 
beverages, either from fresh fruit or by soaking dried slices in 
water. The leaves and small shoots are eaten as salad greens.

<p>
Essential to the cuisines of Southern India and Sri Lanka this citrus 
leaf has no substitute and is not worth much dried. Fortunately it is 
now grown in Southern California and can be had fresh from most Indian 
markets, at least around here. They keep only a few of weeks refrigerated 
and not as long as you'd expect in the freezer, unless you freeze them 
covered with water. The tree bears pea sized black berries with a sweet  
resinous taste, but I've not heard of them being used for cooking.

<p>
This plant is native to north Queensland, in northeast Australia. It 
produces small, tart, aromatic fruit, about 1 inch diameter, with a 
lime-grapefruit flavor. It is cultivated on a small scale in commercial 
bushfood orchards. The fruit is popular in beverages, confections and 
sauces, and is  valued for its high antioxidant content. It is also 
made into jam similar in flavor to marmalade.

<p>
Native to South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan to Java and as far south as 
Sri Lanka, this fruit has a rind so hard it can be carved into utensils. 
The fruit can be up to 3-1/2 inches in diameter and when cracked emits a 
strong citrus aroma from its sticky brown pulp. It is eaten plain, made into 
beverages and deserts and preserved as jam. The bark yields an edible gum 
used as a thickener, and various parts of the tree are used medicinally.

Native to Malaysia, this fruit is now grown in other subtropical and tropical 
regions of the world for it's fruit. The fruit can be up to 5/8 inch in 
diameter and resembles a small citrus fruit. It has a sweet citrus like 
flavor and a juicy, somewhat mucilaginous pulp. It is used similar to 
citrus and may be pickled or made into jams.

[Herb of Grace, <i>R. Ruta graveolens</i>]
<p>
Native to southern Europe, genus <i>Ruta</i> is the type genus for the 
entire citrus family. Once a significant culinary herb in Rome and the 
Near East, rue has declined greatly in use due to changing tastes (it is 
intensely bitter). In Europe and North America it is now grown mainly as 
a decorative, but is used in cooking in North Africa, particularly 
Ethiopia where both leaves and berries are used.</p>
<p>Rue does still appear in some traditional recipes in Greece and is 
used as a flavoring for certain alcoholic beverages. It has a number of 
medicinal uses and is reputed to be a powerful inducer of abortion. 
Ironically, it is the national herb of Lithuania and associated with 
virginity and maidenhood there.

This medium size tree is native to Southeast Asia. The moderately sour 
fruits are about 0.8 inch diameter and 1.2 inches long. The tree is 
popular in cultivation in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
and Indonesia. It is cultivated to a lesser extent in India and Sri Lanka, 
and occasionally in Hawaii and Florida. The fruits normally contain from 
2 to 5 seeds, but a seedless variety has been developed.

[Sleep Sapote; Zapote Blanko (Spanish); Cochitzapotl (Nahuatl = 
sleep-sapote); <i>Casimiroa edulis</i>]
<p>
Native to Eastern Mexico and Central America, this tree became a popular 
decorative in Southern California in the 1920s - a popularity which waned 
rapidly as the trees matured and started dropping a couple thousand pounds 
of sticky fruit on people's patios. Mine is still small and only produces 
a little over 100 pounds of fruit a year. The fruit is sweet and mild, with 
a hint of banana, vanilla, peach or pear depending on variety. It is not 
very marketable because it is extremely tender when ripe and the ripe to 
over-ripe time is very short.</p>
<p>It has been known since pre-Colombian times that eating this fruit 
induces drowsiness. A tea made from the seeds is said to be an effective 
sleep potion without noticeable side effects (I haven't tried it yet). 
This tree is not to be confused with the Black Sapote, which is a variety 
of persimmon, or the Mamey Sapote, of family <i>Sapotaceae</i>.

<h2 id=citru class=lrg><u><i>Citrus</i>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
Genus <small>within</small> <i>Rutaceae</i></u></h2>
<p></p>

<h2>General and History</h2>

<p>Citrus has a casual attitude toward cross breeding and impromptu 
variation that rivals even that of the notorious nightshades. Trying to 
make proper order out of it all is problematic, so some of my practical 
categorizations here may not be strictly correct botanically - but the 
botanists can't agree with each other anyway.</p>

<p>The citrus fruits we are familiar with are crosses between two or 
more other citrus varieties. Citrus is highly promiscuous and doesn't 
respect species boundaries. There are four wild true-breeding species 
from which all the others are derived:</p> 
<ul>
<li><i>Citrus aurantifolia</i> - Key lime.</li>
<li><i>Citrus maxima</i> - Pomelo.</li>
<li><i>Citrus medica</i> - Citron.</li>
<li><i>Citrus reticulata</i> - Mandarin</li>
</ul>
Botanists are suspicious that even these four may not be "pure", but they 
don't know what they might be derived from.

<p>Commercial propagation is generally by cuttings because what you'll 
get from seeds is highly unreliable, and some varieties don't have seeds.

<h2 id="citron">Citron</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>[<i>Citrus medica</i>]</h3> &nbsp; Native to Persia and Media, the 
Citron was the first citrus fruit brought to Europe, thus gave its name 
to the whole genus. Citrons are barely edible with a thick lumpy rind and 
what little flesh they may have is dry and full of seeds. The aromatic 
oils of its thick peel are widely used for flavoring drinks, perfumes, 
etc. The peel itself is often cut into strips and candied for use in 
making fruitcakes - also widely considered inedible.

   <br><img src="img/ci_citronb02h.jpg" alt="Many Fingered Citron" class=mrg>
   [Fingered Citron]
   <p>
   This mutation apparently originated in Northeastern India and is 
   popular as a curiosity. It has no seeds and no or very little 
   juiceless flesh. The rind is, as with other citrons, highly aromatic. 
   In the West the fingers are used as peel would be, but also can be 
   thinly sliced for salads and the like. The white pith is not bitter 
   as it is in most citrus so can be included with the yellow zest. In 
   Asia it is used to perfume rooms and personal items.

   [Etrog (Hebrew)]
   <p>
   These fruits are fairly large and can grow up to 6 inches long, but the 
   rind is very thick and what little flesh they may have is dry and full 
   of seeds. Shape and skin texture varies greatly depending on where on the 
   tree the fruit grew. The citron was known during Roman times, at first for 
   medicinal purposes, to repel insects and as a perfume, but by the 2nd 
   century CE was being used in cooking as well. The peel is candied for use 
   in fruitcakes and other baked goods and is featured in the Hebrew holiday 
   of Sukkot.

   when it is green and between 1-1/2 and 2 inches diameter, when they 
   are at the height of their flavor. A few are sold when ripe and bright 
   yellow. These are most favored for their tart spicy juice but the zest 
   is also used. They are used to flavor fish, soups and mushrooms, and 
   used in ponzu blends. Some are now grown in Southern California and 
   sold, in late summer and early fall, at the Beverly Hills and Santa 
   Monica Farmer's markets, places I wouldn't go on a bet. High price 
   Westside chefs scramble for them before the official opening times.

   with high acidity and few seeds. In the store the varieties are 
   indistinguishable but on the tree the Eureka are at the tips of 
   branches and the Lisbon farther in behind the leaves, thus better

   It has an oval shape and a thin skin that's quite orange compared to

   Not really a lime, this fruit is native to Southeast Asia and used 
   particularly in Thai Cuisine. The odd double leaves are most used, 
   often in soups, but the rind of the fruit is used in Thai curry pastes. 
   The rind is also used to flavor rum in R&eacute;union and Madagascar. 
   Many references say the juice is inedible but I do not find that the case, 
   though there isn't a lot of juice in a kaffir lime.</p>
   <p>The shrub makes a very nice and 
   useful decorative which can be grown in a container, so many nurseries 
   stock them. When fully ripe, the fruit turns just a touch yellowish and 
   falls from the tree but it is generally used before that stage.

   because of demand from the fancy chef set.</p> 
   <p>This fruit is unique in several ways, other than its shape. The 
   juice vesicles separate completely into tiny beads, described 
   as "citrus caviar". This has become popular as a garnish in expensive 
   restaurants. Finger limes come in a wide range of colors: green, 
   yellow, orange, red, purple, pink, black and brown. The largest of 
   the photo specimens was 2-3/4 inches long, 0.8 inch diameter and

   This small tree (to 25 feet) is native to Southeast Asia, but is now 
   widely grown in the Mediterranean region, India, Iran and southern Mexico. 
   It is low in acidity and lightly sweet, but retains a light lime flavor.
   The left photo specimen was 3-5/8 inches diameter, 2-7/8 inches high and 
   weighed 10-7/8 ounces. American varieties tend to have a dimple at the 
   flower end, as just visible in the photo, while those in South Asia 
   (Mosambi cultivar) generally do not.</p>  
   <p>Juice of this fruit is the most common citrus juice in India, Pakistan 
   and Bangladesh, often sold freshly squeezed by street vendors and flavored 
   with a dash of salty Chat Masala. It needs to be freshly squeezed because 
   it fairly quickly turns bitter when exposed to air, but it freezes well.
   </p>
   <p>Limetta is ripe when green-yellow, heavy in weight for its size, and a 
   fingernail scratch produces aromatic oil from the rind. It will keep up 
   to 2 weeks at a cool room temperature and 6 to 8 weeks refrigerated. The

   It is grown mainly for aromatic oils extracted from the peel, used for

   Delight confections. A marmalade is made from the peel in Syria, and 
   possibly other places. The fruit pulp is not considered edible, but 
   the juice is used in some local areas.</p>

   <p>This is the orange from which Orange Blossom Water, much used in 
   Mediterranean cuisines, is made. It takes 7 pounds of blossoms to 
   make a gallon of fragrant water. 80% of the entire commercial crop is 
   grown in Calabria, Italy. Some is grown in southern France, Ivory Coast, 
   Africa, and in southern Turkey, but the quality of the essential oil is 
   not as good due to soil differences.

   The flesh has coloration similar to a pink grapefruit, which is caused

   This orange was discovered in Brazil and brought to California where it is 
   a major crop variety. The distinguishing feature is a second, partially

   indentation or projection resembling a human navel at the flower end. 
   This is large orange with a thick easily peeled rind, no seeds and the 
   segments separate very easily making 
   it a desirable eating orange. Older trees produce fruit with a thicker 
   pith layer in the rind. Navels are not used for juice because the juice 
   turns bitter if not used right away.  The photo sample was 4-1/4 inches 
   in diameter and weighed 1 pound 3 ounces (I have bought them up to 2

   The fruit is smallish, has lots of seeds and is very sweet, tasting 
   like a Pomelo with a hint of Mandarin. They are quite juicy but the 
   membranes are fragile and the flesh soft so if you try to eat one 
   with a grapefruit spoon it will break up. My favorite way to eat

   I just eat the pulp off the rind. They are often squeezed for juice. 
   Mandelos may be dark green with a yellow blush, or can be entirely 
   yellow. The photo specimens were typically 3.5 inches diameter and 
   weighed 11-5/8 ounces. They were purchased from a large Asian market

   They are roughly spherical but flattened on the flower end. They have 
   seeds and the thin skin is relatively difficult to peel but hey are quite 
   sweet and have excellent flavor. The photo specimens were typically 
   2.3 inches in diameter and weighed 3-3/8 ounces.

   <h3>Fallglo Tangarine</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_fallglo07h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Fallglo fruit" class=mrg>
   [PLU #3144; (tangerine x tengelo) x (tangarine x orange)]
   <p>
   This variety, typically grown in Florida, starts to appear in stores in 
   mid October and reaches optimum flavor near the end of November. The 
   tight peel is 1/8 to 3/16 inch thick, very smooth with a distinctive 
   red-orange color. It is moderately easy to peel, particularly if you 
   start from the stem end. The segments are easy to separate. This 
   tangarine is sweet-tart and very juicy, similar to an orange, but with 
   some tangarine flavor. It often, but not always, has a distinct navel, 
   as shown to the right in the photo, and typically has between 20 and 
   40 seeds. This is a new variety released by the USDA Horticultural 
   Station in 1989. It is thought to be 5/8 tangerine, 1/4 orange and 1/8 
   grapefruit. The photo specimens, purchased in early October, were 
   typically 2.7 inches in diameter and weighed 5-1/2 ounces, though 
   they can get up to 3-1/8 inches and 7-1/2 ounces, depending on the 
   tree. 2014 US $0.99/#.

   <h3>Gold Nugget Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_gnugg02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Gold Nugget fruit" class=mrg>
   [PLU #4055; <i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco (Wilking mandarin x 
   Kincy mandarin)]
   <p>
   This mandarin was developed by the University of California 
   Riverside, and released around 2000. It's season is late February to 
   early June.  This seedless mandarin has a loose rind that peels 
   very easily, and segments that separate just as easily. It is juicy, 
   very sweet and of outstanding flavor - judged by professional taste 
   panels to be one of the best flavored citrus in the world. The photo 
   specimens, purchased in Los Angeles in mid March, 2017, were typically 
   3-1/8 inches in diameter and 2-1/4 inches high, weighing 6-1/2 ounces 
   - 2017 US $0.79 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>


   <h3>Kinnow</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_kinnow05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Kinnow Fruit" class=mrg>
   Developed at the University of California Riverside this is now the 
   most planted mandarin in Pakistan and Punjab, but some are grown in 
   California too. It is smooth skinned, slightly flattened at the ends, 
   and while the skin is much tighter than with most mandarins it is 
   still easily peelable and the segments separate fairly easily. The 
   flesh is orange, seedy, very juicy, aromatic, sweet and richly 
   flavored.
   <p>The peel has a fair amount of oil so it's good to use where 
   tangarine peel is needed and it dries well. This is an excellent 
   all-around cooking and eating mandarin. The California crop becomes 
   available in January and runs until April. The photo specimens were 
   about 2-7/8 inches diameter and weighed 5-1/2 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3>Minneola Tangelo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_mineola05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Mineola Fruit" class=mrg>
   [#4383; Honeybell <i>Citrus x tangelo</i>]
   <p>
   A cross between the Duncan grapefruit and Dancy mandarin, this tangelo 
   presents a hint of the tartness of it's grapefruit parent, especially 
   early in its season. The skin is thin and tight, but it is peelable 
   and segments separate easily. It is juicy with rich flavor and very 
   sweet near the end of its season - mid-December through April. Cross 
   pollination produces higher yields than unpollinated trees but then 
   there will be seeds in the fruit. The largest of the photo specimens 
   was 3-1/8 inches diameter and weighed 8-3/4 ounces. The photo 
   specimens were purchased in Los Angeles in mid-March for 2017 US 
   $0.69 / pound, and were very sweet.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Murcott Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_murcott04h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Mercotts" class=mrg>
   [Honey Tangerine; <i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco]
   <p>
   Grown in Florida under the "Honey Tangerine" name, it is also grown 
   in California under its real name, Murcott. It's origin is unknown 
   but it's thought to be a cross between a tangerine and a sweet orange, 
   first grown by the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) around 1916. 
   This very sweet Tangor is a slightly flattened sphere. The skin is 
   smooth and often loose, peeling very easily to reasonably easily 
   (variable within a batch), and the segments separate very easily. 
   Most will be seedless but others will have a few seeds. The largest 
   in the photo (back right) was 3 inches diameter, 2-1/4 inches high 
   and weighed 5-3/8 ounces. The photo specimens were purchased in Los 
   Angeles in mid March for 2017 US $0.79 / pound.

   <h3>Orlando Tangelo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_orlando02k.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Orlandos" class=mrg>
   [PLU #4456]
   <p>
   This tangelo is a cross between a Duncan grapefruit and a Dancy mandarin. 
   These will have a few seeds and the skin is tight - peelable but with 
   more difficulty than others in this category. They are available from 
   November through January.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Royal Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_royal05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Royal Mandarins" class=mrg>
   [Temple Orange, PLU #4455]
   <p>
   These fairly large tangors have a thin, somewhat loose fitting skin 
   that peels easily and the segments separate fairly easily, but they 
   can be so juicy some escapes. The skin is slightly pebbled and and 
   slightly depressed at the flower end, flavor is quite sweet, almost 
   spicy, and they have few or no seeds. Found in Jamaica as a naturally 
   occurring tangor, they are grown in Florida and in the warmest inland 
   valleys of California - available from mid January through February. 
   The leafy photo specimen was 3-1/3 inches in diameter and weighed 
   9 ounces, but they can be quite a bit smaller.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3>Ruby Tango Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_rubyt02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Ruby Tango Mandarins" class=mrg>
   [Red Nules, Mandared, red Clementine, PLU #4458]
   <p>
   These Mandarins are a deliberate cross between a Clemenules clementine 
   (or Nules) and a Blood Orange. The result is a fairly large fruit, 
   though size varies, that has flesh from orange to red to purple. 
   Amount of red varies from fruit to fruit and is uneven in the segments. 
   The skin is quite smooth and tight fitting, but is fairly easy to peel 
   off, and the segments separate quite easily. It is very juicy with 
   distinctive tart-sweet flavor. They are grown in California and 
   available from February through March. The large photo specimens 
   weighed 6-7/8 ounces and were 2-3/8 inches high and 3 inches diameter. 
   The photo specimens were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in 
   Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2018 US $1.29 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3 id="satsu">Satsuma Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_satsuma12h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Orange Satsuma Mandarin" class=mrg>
   [Unshu Mikan (Japan), Wenzhou Migan (China)]
   <p>
   This variety was originally found in China but brought to the U.S. 
   from Japan. Most grown in China now are also varieties brought back 
   from Japan.  There are many varieties grown in the U.S. but the Owari 
   Satsuma is the most common. They have a very loose skin and are 
   extremely easy to peel but the flesh is easily bruised and the loose 
   skin may conceal damage. These mandarins are juicy with good sweet 
   flavor and ease of peeling makes them particularly desirable so 
   efforts are being made to extend their short season of availability.
   </p>
   <p>The largest of the photo specimens was 3.0 inches in diameter and 
   weighed 6-1/4 ounces, but size varies quite a bit. They are available 
   from mid October through December.The photo specimens were purchased 
   from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) in early 
   December for 2018 US $0.99 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Satsuma Mandarin - Green</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_satsuma10h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Green Satsuma Mandarin" class=mrg>
   I find these in the market in early October so they're about as early 
   season as mandarins get.They seemed to me a bit less sweet than regular 
   satsumas, but I didn't have the opportunity to do a direct comparison. 
   Same size and shape as the regular satsumas but the skin is definitely 
   less wrinkled.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Sumo Citrus&reg;</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_sumo02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Sumo Citrus" class=mrg>
   [PLU #3632; Dekopon (Japan); Hallabong (Korea); 
   <i>Citrus reticulata</i> var 4y7<i>Shiranui</i>]
   <p>
   This fruit, developed in Japan, is a cross between a Satsuma Mandarin 
   and a California sweet orange. It is fairly sweet, with a flavor that 
   is an interesting, almost spicy, mix of Mandarin and Orange. It 
   peels very easily and the segments separate very easily without 
   losing any of their juice. The photo specimens were quite large at 
   2-5/8 inches diameter and 2-1/2 inches high, weighing 10.7 ounces 
   each. This fruit has become very popular in Japan and Korea as a 
   "gift citrus", and sells for as much as 2018 US $8.00 each in Tokyo. 
   Sumos are still rare in North America, but are now grown by some 
   family farms in California - avilable February to May. I bought the 
   photo specimens from a Yuppie oriented outlet in Los Angeles 
   (Montrose) for 2018 US $1.99 each, or $2.98 / pound. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Shasta Mandarin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ci_shasta01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Partially Peeled Shasta Mandarins" class=mrg>
   Now this is just ridiculous - a tangerine that weighs over a pound! 
   That big guy on the left was 1 pound 3-5/8 oz, 3 inches high and 4-5/8 
   inches in diameter, about the size of a medium navel orange. Even the 
   smallest of the batch (cut open) weighed 10 ounces. Yet they're all a 
   tangerine should be: easy to peel, easy to segment, juicy, very sweet, 
   tasty and seedless. Formerly TDE2 it was released by the University of 
   California as Shasta Gold in 2002. They mature from mid-February to 
   mid-March but hold on the tree well so can be found as late as early 
   May.

   <br><img src="img/ci_ugli01k.jpg" alt="Whole Ugli Fruit" class=mrg>
   [Uniq, <i>Citrus reticulata x Citrus paradisi</i>]
   <p>
   A tangelo, a cross between a tangerine and a pomello or grapefruit, 
   found growing wild in Jamaica, where it is now cultivated. This is a large 
   fruit, a little smaller than a grapefruit, and has a rough, blotchy rind, 
   and is at is peak when the green blotches turn mostly orange.  The rind 
   is loose and the flesh juicy and sweet, more like a tangerine than a 
   grapefruit. They are in season from December to April when they are 
   exported to the US and Europe. I've never seen one in California, which 
   isn't surprising considering the citrus import restrictions here (designed 
   to protect the huge California citrus industry from imported bugs and 
   diseases).

<h2>Calamansi</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ci_calamansi01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Calamansi" class=mrg>
[Calamondin; <i>x Citrofortunella microcarpa</i>]
<p>
A tiny citrus fruit similar to an orange but more sour, widely planted 
in Southeast Asia and particularly the Philippines. A cross between 
a kumquat and a mandarin, it is not known in the wild and isn't much 
grown in the U.S. because it is very frost tender. In the Philippines 
and Southeast Asia it is used green to make preserves and ripe to make 
fruit syrup, juice and as a flavoring for meat.</p>
<p>In Southern California and Hawaii they're often available in 
Philippine markets, but the cost is too high for uses that call for a 
lot of them. Calamansi juice can be found in the frozen food cases at 
Philippine markets, but if you can't get it use 3 parts lemon juice, 
1 part orange juice. That'll be a little sweeter than real Calamansi, 
but close enough for 
most uses.<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=quat>Kumquat</h2>
<br><img src="img/ci_kumq05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Kumquats" class=mrg>
[<i>Citrus japonica</i> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  prev. genus <i>Fortunella</i>, 
various species]
<p>
These small fruits, belonging to the genus <i>Fortunella</i>, originated 
in China. Most common in the U.S. are the Nagami (oval) and Marumi 
(round). The kumquat has a sweet rind and sour flesh, just the opposite 
of the closely related citrus fruits. In the U.S. it is generally eaten 
raw in salads, used in place of olives in martinis, or made into 
marmalade and the shrub is a common backyard ornamental in Southern 
California. They are in season from late autumn to mid-winter but are 
generally available most of the year. The photo specimens were typically 
1-3/8 inches long, 1 inch diameter and weighed 1/2 ounce each.

<h2>Orangequat</h2>
<br><img src="img/ci_orngqt01h.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Limettas" class=mrg>

<br>A cross between a <a href="citrus.html#quat">Meiwa Kumquat</a> and a 
<a href="citrus.html#satsu">Satsuma Mandarin</a>. It has a sweet rind and slightly 
bitter pulp like a Kumquat, but is noticeably larger with a distinctly 
orange flavor.
