<p>
These cucumbers are grown on fully functional vines with both male and female 
flowers so they have a large seed mass and plenty of seeds. Consequently 
they have more real cucumber flavor than seedless varieties.</p>
<p>The skin is fairly tough and bitter so they are almost always peeled. 
Since they'll be peeled anyway growers seal them with a heavy coating of wax 
for longer storage - they'll last at least two weeks in the fridge. You do 
want to peel them because you don't know who sponsored the FDA studies 
certifying that wax as "edible".</p>

<p>Size varies widely but the photo specimen is 9-1/4 inches long, 2-3/8 
inches diameter and weighed 1-1/4 pounds. A more typical supermarket size 
would likely be 12 ounces to a pound. The cut one was picked quite young so 
the seeds are immature and the seed mass is relaively small. When cucumbers 
become over-ripe they start to yellow, the seeds start to harden and the 
seed mass gets a stronger flavor.
