<p>[Hothouse Cucumber, Burpless Cucumber, Seedless Cucumber, English 
Cucumber]
</p><p>
These cucumbers are grown on vines that produce only female flowers. 
Since the flowers have no way to get knocked up they produce seedless 
fruit. Seeds to grow them are expensive because to produce them rare 
vines that have one or more male flowers must be found. 

<p>Growing the vines take special care, and even in California they have 
to be grown in hothouses or screened buildings. Care must be taken that 
bees and other pollinating insects cannot access the flowers. Should a 
bee that has visited sexually functional cucumber plants outside get in, 
hybrid seeds will develop. In Southern California, these have been pretty 
much totally displaced by the 
<a href="ck_persz.html"><b>Persian Cucumber</b></a>, which tastes 
better and is much more economical to produce.</p>

<p>They are never waxed because with so thin a skin these cukes are 
normally not peeled. This makes them highly perishable due to dehydration 
and consequent rot. Southern California high volume produce markets 
sell them and call them "European Cucumber". Larger straighter varieties 
are shrink wrapped in plastic for longer shelf life so they can be shipped 
to distant markets and are called <b>English Cucumbers</b>.</p>

<p>The larger of the photo specimens was 13 inches long (uncurled) 1-3/4 
inches diameter at the thickest point and weighed 10 ounces. Typical 
shrink wrapped specimens are a little bigger but generally weigh less 
than a pound.

<p>Some people claim to be bothered by gas from regular cucumbers and the 
problem is said to originate from the seed mass. Since these have little 
seed mass they are called "Burpless". Personally, I eat piles of 
standard issue cucumbers and Persian cucumbers without gas problems, 
and haven't heard anyone else complain either - perhaps the English 
are "different"? Well, we know they are, but we're just talking about 
cucumbers here.</p>

<p>Because their seed mass is small and not watery the European cucumber 
is good for applications using whole slices such as sandwiches and 
salads. Since they are sold unwaxed, the skin can be left on or peeled 
decoratively to add visual appeal. The downside is that they have less 
cucumber flavor than the standard green blimps or pickling kerbeys and 
what flavor there is dominated by the skin.</p>
