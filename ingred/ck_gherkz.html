True Gherkins are a small non-<i>sativa</i> cucumber native to southern 
Africa from Zaire south to Botswana and naturalized in Madagascar, but 
are best known for cultivation in the Caribbean region. The non-bitter 
less spiky varieties developed in the Caribbean have been reintroduced 
to Africa and are now cultivated there. The plant is also grown in 
Brazil and other parts of South America.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean and South America fruit is picked quite young, as 
it gets bitter and more spiky when much over 1-1/2 inches long. It is 
generally pickled, but is also cooked as a vegetable, particularly in 
soups. In Africa, leaves of the bitter varieties are used as greens, and 
some of the non-bitter varieties are pickled.</p>
<p>In the U.S. this plant is grown in gardens for private use in Florida 
and exists in isolated patches as weeds in several other states including 
a county each in California and Texas. It is not considered an aggressive 
weed and seeds are available from suppliers.
