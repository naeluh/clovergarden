[Beit Alpha; <i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
<p>
These cucumbers are mostly seedless, and what seeds they may have are 
so young they are not a bother. The seed mass is larger than with the 
European / English cucumbers, so they have better flavor. Unlike the 
European / English cucumbers, Persians can be field grown, thus far 
more economical. They are sometimes called "Beit Alpha", the name of 
a kibbutz in northern Israel where they were first developed.</p>

<p>The center one of the photo specimens was 7-1/4 inches long and 
1.52 inches diameter, weighing 5-3/4 ounces. This is an above average 
size, but California vegetables keep getting bigger for ease of 
harvesting.</p>

<p>"Mini" versions of this cuke have started to appear in Southern 
California produce markets in mid 2018 - see below.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California, every produce 
market has a mountain of these - they are wildly popular. The price 
varies wildly too, depending on season and availability. The photo 
specimens were purchased in January from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2019 US $1.49 / pound, which is near 
the high end - they can be as low as $0.69 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These cukes are unwaxed, so you should not 
try to store them for more than 5 days. In longer storage they will 
start to get soft spots.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; While most are consumed raw in salads or with 
dips, these cukes are fine for soups, stir fries and other recipes 
calling for cooking cucumbers. They are much better for this than the 
conventional "green blimps".<p></p>

<h2>Mini Persian Cucumber</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/ck_mini02d.jpg" alt="Mini Persian Cucumbers - whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
These small Persian Cucumbers appeared in Los Angeles produce markets 
in mid 2018. They are still seldom seen, but may become popular. 
They were typically 3.5 inches long and 0.8 inch diameter. Texture and 
taste were pretty much identical to the full size Persians.
