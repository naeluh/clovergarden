Kokum is a purple fruit used as a souring agent, usually in dried form, 
though a soft salt preserved form is common in India.  
It is common along the western coast of India where the tree is native, and 
takes the place tamarind fills elsewhere. It is used in other regions as 
well, particularly Sri Lanka and Malaysia where it is used in fish curries 
and is said to slow spoilage.</p>
<p>In general, whole pieces of the dried fruit rind are added 
to curries and similar dishes. It is also used, often in syrup form, to 
flavor summer beverages. The photo specimens, obtained from an Indian market 
in Los Angeles, were up to 1-1/8 inches in diameter.

<p>Oil extracted from the seeds remains solid at room temperature and is 
called Kokum Butter. It is used for confectionery, cosmetics, medicinals 
and as a moisturizer for dry and cracked skin. Various parts of the fruit 
and plant are used medicinally.</p>
<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Kokum can be found in specialty markets 
serving and Indian community. It may not look like the photo because it 
may also be split lengthwise with the seeds scraped out.<p></p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Kokum is often soaked in water for about 1/2 
hour, with seeds removed. Other ingredients are then added and cooking 
is started. The kokum pieces are usually removed before serving 
(sometimes they are removed right after soaking).<p></p>

<h2 class=h1>Gummi-Gutta</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_gummi02d.jpg" alt="Ripe Fruit" class=mrg>
  [Gambooge, Brindleberry, 
  Malabar Tamarind, Asam fruit; Kujee Thekera (Assam); 
  Vadakkan puli (northern tamarind), Kudam puli (pot tamarind), 
  Citrin Fruit; Kodumpulli, Fish Tamarind (Kerala); Punampuli, Kudampuli 
  (Kodava); Goraka (Sri Lanka); <i>Garcinia gummi-gutta</i> formerly 
  <i>Garcinia cambogia</i>]
<p>
Native to Indonesia but now grown in other regions, this fruit, 
when mature, is orange or yellow with sutures, resembling a miniature 
pumpkin, though shape may vary. The thick rind is used as a souring 
agent in curries, particularly in Kerala, the far southwest coast of 
India, and in Sri Lanka. Like Kokum, it is sold in both hard dried form 
and soft salt preserved form, though only the dried form is likely 
available in North America. It is more citrusy than Kokum. It is also 
used, especially by the Kodava (Coorg) people, to make a strong dark 
vinegar called Kaachambuli. Recipes calling for Gummi-Gutta may ask 
for "a few petals". The dried fruit splits along the sutures into these 
"petals". </p>
<p>Gummi-gutta is also now grown in south and central Africa. In the 
West it was recently strongly hyped as a weight loss aid by famous 
TV snake oil salesman Dr. Oz. Formal studies have shown it less 
effective than a placebo - no weight loss and some risk of liver 
toxicity, but I'm sure it's been profitable for Dr. Oz.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I haven't yet noticed this in the Indian markets 
here in Los Angeles, but it is available on-line, product of Sri Lanka. 
2020 US $9.99 for 200 grams. Yes, it is as black as shown in the photo.
<p></p>

<h3>Measures:</h3> &nbsp; This product is generally used dried. In 
Sri Lanka, recipes typically call for something like "5 pieces". 
Basing on an average of the larger pieces found in bags from Sri Lanka, 
they weigh 0.15 ounces (4.5 grams) each. So, 5 pieces would be about 
0.75 ounce or 1-1/2 Tablespoon (21 grams). Elsewhere recipes often 
call for "Petals" (dried segments) which are likely about the same 
weight as Sri Lankan "pieces".  Gambooge is often treated as is Kokum 
(see above). In Sri Lankan fish curries, it is soaked 10 minutes or so, 
then heavily pounded in a mortar and mixed with enough water to make 
a paste. It is then mixed with seasonings for the recipe.<p></p>
<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Kokum, which is easier to find in North America, 
can be substituted with some difference in flavor. Kokum is more plum 
like, Gummy-Gutta more citrusy.
<p>Tamarind, is the other suggested substitute, which is considered by 
Sri Lankans to be too sour for fish (Gambooge is sometimes called 
"Fish Tamarind"). Actually the two are very different. Tamarind has a 
pleasant date-like flavor, while Gambooge is much stronger, with a 
somewhat acrid flavor. To equal the volume and strength of the Gambooge, 
you'd need to cut about 2 times the weight off a block of Tamarind as 
the weight of Gambooge called for, and process it into paste. It will be 
a lot lighter in color and a bit more sour.
