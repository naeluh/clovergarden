<h1>Mangosteens</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Mangosteen family (<i>Clusiaceae</i>) includes a number of genera 
of plants, most of which are extreme tropicals, though a few will grow in 
southern Florida and Hawaii.They are grown mainly for their fruit, which 
has thick edible arils surrounding the seeds. Many are highly medicinal, 
and some are noted for powerful antioxidants. Recently, some in genus 
<i>Garcinia</i> have been strongly hyped by the weight loss industry, 
but legitimate studies have discredited that use. Many in this family 
also produce high quality timber.

<h2 class=lrg>Genus Garcinia</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Purple Mangosteen</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_mangos04e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Mangosteens" class=mrg>
[<i>Garcinia mangostana</i>]
<p>The Purple Mangosteen is a rather picky tropical tree which only grows 
well in a few locations in Southeast Asia and Central Africa, though a few 
are grown in Hawaii. The tree may grow to 80 feet under the right conditions 
but will be killed by temperatures above 100&deg;F/38&deg;C or below 
40&deg;F/4.5&deg;C, and it's very fussy about soil as well.</p>

<p>The photo specimens were purchased in February 2008 soon after the 
ban on fresh mangosteens was lifted - provided they were fumigated or subjected 
to irradiation sufficient to kill Asian fruit fly. Previously they were only 
available frozen. These were about 2-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 5-1/8 
ounces. Yield is about 33%, and at US $4.50/pound for whole fruit that 
made them quite expensive.</p>
<p>The fruit is of excellent flavor, sweet and tangy, and is eaten fresh 
from the shell cut (or more properly broken) as shown in the photo. Segments 
may or may not include a seed and the seeds are edible after boiling or 
roasting. The number of petals on the flower end of the fruit will be the 
same as the number of segments within.</p>
<p>Canned mangosteen is easily available in the U.S. but not considered as 
good because the flavor is quickly degraded by canning heat.<p>
<p>The purplish fruit has a thin brittle shell and a thick fibrous rind which 
is very high in pectin. A jelly is made from it after bitter elements have 
been leached out with salt. The red juice of the rind is a dye that's nearly 
impossible to remove from fabric.</p>
<p>Mangosteen rind has long been used in China and Southeast Asia as an 
herbal medicine and now mangosteen juice (made from rind and pulp) is 
heavily promoted in the U.S. through sophisticated "Network Marketing" 
schemes. It sells for over US $1.00/ounce with implications it can relieve 
everything up to and including cancer. Claims for it's benefits are 
almost completely unconfirmed and it's extremely unlikely the juice can 
deliver anything like the benefits implied. It is, however, making a huge 
amount of money for its perpetrators (<a href="cl_mangost.html#m02">M2)</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Kokum Phool</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_kokum01e.jpg" alt="Split dried Kokum Phool Fruit" class=mrg>
[Wild Mangosteen (English); Amsool, Aamsul, Bindin, Biran, Bhirand, 
Bhinda, Bhrinda, Brinda, Kokum, Kokam, Katambi, Panarpuli, Kudam Puli, 
Ratamba (India); Goraka (Sri Lanka); <i>Garcinia indica</i>]
<p>
Kokum is purple fruit used as a souring agent, usually in dried form, 
though a soft salt preserved form is common in India.  
It is common along the western coast of India where the tree is native, and 
takes the place tamarind fills elsewhere. It is used in other regions as 
well, particularly Sri Lanka and Malaysia where it is used in fish curries 
and is said to slow spoilage.</p>
<p>In general, whole pieces of the dried fruit rind are added 
to curries and similar dishes. It is also used, often in syrup form, to 
flavor summer beverages. The photo specimens, obtained from an Indian market 
in Los Angeles, were up to 1-1/8 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Oil from the seeds remains solid at room temperature and is used for 
confectionery, cosmetics and medicinals. Various parts of the fruit and 
plant are used medicinally.

<h2>Gummi-Gutta</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_gummi02e.jpg" alt="Whole Ripe Gummi-Gutta Fruit" class=mrg>
[Gambooge, Brindleberry, Malabar Tamarind, Asam fruit; Kujee Thekera 
(Assam); Vadakkan puli (northern tamarind), Kudam puli (pot tamarind), 
Citrin Fruit; Kodumpulli, Fish Tamarind (Kerala); Punampuli, Kudampuli 
(Kodava); Goraka (Sri Lanka); <i>Garcinia gummi-gutta</i> formerly 
<i>Garcinia cambogia</i>]
<p>
Native to Indonesia but now grown in other regions, this fruit, 
when mature, is orange or yellow with sutures, resembling a miniature 
pumpkin, though shape may vary. It is used as a souring agent in curries, 
particularly in Kerala, the far southwest coast of India. It grows at 
higher altitudes than Kokum, so is used by hill tribes like the Kodava. 
Like Kokum it is sold in both hard dried form and soft salt preserved form, and is more 
citrusy than Kokum. It is also used, especially by the Kodava (Coorg) 
people, to make a strong dark vinegar called Kaachambuli.  
Recipes calling for Gummi-Gutta may ask for "a few petals". The dried 
fruit splits along the sutures into these "petals". 
&nbsp; <a href="cl_kokumz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>
<p>Gummi-gutta is also now grown in south and central Africa. In the 
West it was recently strongly hyped as a weight loss aid, but formal 
studies have shown it no more effective than a placebo, and there is 
some risk of liver toxicity.

<h2>Gambooge</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_brindle01c.jpg" alt="Drawing of Plant" class=mrg>
[Gambooge (English, India); Kujee Thekera (Assam); Makki (Tamil); 
Batuan (Philippine); <i>Garcinia morella</i>]
<p>
This fruit tree, to about 40 feet tall, is found in northeastern 
India, Sri Lanka and the southern Philippines. Ripe fruit are very 
acidic, so not often eaten fresh. It is dried, pickled, made into chutney 
and otherwise preserved for use as a souring ingredient in lentil dishes. 
Dried fruit is used in lentil curries also in sour fish curries in 
Assam, in the far northeast of India.

<h2>Indian Tamarind</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cl_goraka01h.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Goraka Fruit" class=mrg>
[Red Mango, Brindleberry (English); Korakkaipuli (Tamil); Kana goraka, 
Honda goraka (Sinhala); <i>Garcinia quaesita</i>]
<p>Found only in Sri Lanka, the fruit of this medium size tree (up to 
65 feet) is small, yellow or purple to reddish, and with 7 to 12 deep 
vertical grooves. It is mildly to moderately acidic and considered very 
good for eating out of hand. It is also sold dried as a souring agent.

[Asam Gelugor, Asam Gulugo, Asam Keping (Malay); 
<i>Garcinia atroviridis</i>]
<p>
This yellow fruit, native to the rainforests of Malaysia and 
Thailand, is too sour to eat fresh, but has long been used dried as a 
flavoring in curries, and the like, particularly in Malaysia but 
increasingly in Thailand. The photo specimens, purchased from a large 
Indian market in Glendale, CA, were about 2-1/8 inches across.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Bar Thekera</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_sukan01h.jpg" alt="Sliced Dried Bar Thekera Fruit" class=mrg>
[Sukan Thekera; <i>Garcinia pedunculata</i>]
<p>
This broad leaf tree is native to Assam in the northeast of India and 
parts of Burma (Myanmar). In Assam, this sour fruit is eaten fresh, but 
more commonly it is sliced and sun dried for inclusion in sour fish 
curry, vegetable dishes and in fried lentil cakes. The fruit is 
between 3 and 5 inches diameter and contains seeds surrounded by juicy 
edible arils.

<h2>Achacha</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_achach01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Achacha Fruit" class=mrg>
[Achachair&uacute; <i>Garcinia humilis</i>]
<p>
This fruit is grown primarily in Bolivia, but has recently been 
planted commercially in Australia where there is an ongoing advertising 
campaign to promote it. The nearly spherical orange fruits are up to 
2-1/2 inches in length, and the arils have a bitter-sweet taste.

<h2>African Mangosteen</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_livingst01h.jpg" alt="African Mangosteen Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Lowveld Mangosteen; Imbe; <i>Garcinia livingstonei</i>]
<p>
Native to a broad area of Africa from Somalia to South Africa, 
this is a traditional food plant in the region. There and elsewhere it is 
also grown as a decorative fruit tree. The taste of the aril surrounding 
the single seed is pleasantly sweet-sour, but it contains a latex some 
people dislike. The juice is used in beverages. The thin skinned orange 
fruit is up to 1-5/8 inches diameter. This tree can be grown in southern 
Florida (where the photo was taken) and is often made up as a male/female 
graft so a single isolated tree will bear fruit.

[Button Mangosteen; <i>Garcinia prainiana</i>]
<p>
Cultivated in Southeast Asia, this fruit has a very thin skin, making 
it easy to eat fresh. Some have compared the flavor to a tangerine. This tree 
can be grown in southern Florida (where the photo was taken).

<p>
Native to tropical South America, this tree bears roughly spherical 
fruit up to 5-1/2 inches in diameter. The aril has a sweet-sour taste and 
is often used to make condiments and beverages. The oily seeds are used 
medicinally to treat skin conditions.

<p></p>

<h2>Tallow Tree</h2>
<br><img src="img/cl_allanfb01k.jpg" alt="Tallow Tree Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Allanblackia floribunda</i>]
<p>
Native to central Africa this tree is common in the rainforest 
understory. The large fruit is particularly important in Nigeria, where 
the seeds are gathered for cooking oil and soap making. It is also 
suitable for making margarine and other products requiring an oil that is 
solid at room temperature, and is now approved for use in the European 
Union.  The slimy fruit pulp is sometimes made into jams and jellies.</p>
<p>Currently, the fruit is gathered wild, but efforts to cultivate the 
trees commercially are in progress. Ripeness cannot be judged on the tree, 
so fallen fruit is gathered from the ground. The fruit are up to 12 
inches long and contain around 100 seeds in a translucent pulp. The oil 
is about 50% stearic acid (saturated fat) and 45% Oleic acid 
(monounsaturated fat). The government of Nigeria is working to 
establish a commercial export industry based on this oil.

[Mkange, Mkanye, Mkimbo, Mshambo, Mwaka (Swahili); 
<i>Allanblackia stuhlmannii</i>]
<p>
Found only in Tanzania in central Africa, this tree is quite 
similar to the more widespread <i>A. floribunda</i>.  The seeds are 
gathered in the wild for cooking oil and soap making. The oil is also 
suitable for making margarine and other products requiring an oil that 
is solid at room temperature.</p>
<p>Currently, the fruit is gathered wild, but efforts to cultivate the 
trees commercially are in progress. The oil is about the same as that 
of <i>A. floribunda</i>, which is 50% stearic acid (saturated fat) and 
45% Oleic acid (monounsaturated fat).
