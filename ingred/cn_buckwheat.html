<h1>Buckwheat <small>&amp;</small> Sorrel</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Buckwheat family (<i>Polygonaceae</i>) provides only a few species 
used for food, but one of them, buckwheat itself, has been of great 
importance to human survival since prehistoric times. Great hardship was 
caused in Russia when Soviet central planning decided to shift farming 
from traditional crops like buckwheat to "modern" crops like wheat. 
Buckwheat grows well on marginal land in cold climates, wheat does not.<p>

<h2>Common Buckwheat</h2>
<br><a href="cn_buckz.html">
<img src="img/cn_bkwht04e.jpg" alt="Buckwheat seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Gretchka (Russia), <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>]
<p>
These tiny three sided pyramidal seeds, about 0.15 inches long, are 
incorrectly called "kasha" in the U.S. - in Russia "kasha" is any grain 
cooked to a porridge consistency. Buckwheat was so important to Russians 
that an early Russian Olympic team, when they found they couldn't get 
grechnevaya kasha in Paris, packed up and went home.</p>
<p>Buckwheat is sold as "groats", the edible part of the seed after the 
fibrous hull has been removed. The photo shows roasted groats to the left, 
the way they're usually sold in the U.S. and unroasted to the right (purchased 
from a Korean grocery in Los Angeles). Buckwheat is also sold ground into 
flour, which is mixed with wheat flour to make buckwheat pancakes in the U.S. 
and soba noodles in Japan. Buckwheat greens are toxic to humans, but sprout 
enthusiasts do sprout the seeds and eat them at four to five days of 
growth. Buckwheat is also sprouted and malted to make gluten free beer 
for those allergic to gluten.

<p>The somewhat more bitter Tartary Buckwheat <i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i> 
is still cultivated as a food crop in the Himalayan region.

   (Turkish); Rau Chua (Viet-American);  Ambada Bhaji, Gongoora (India), 
   <i>Rumex acetosa</i>]
   <p>
   Sorrel grows wild over much of Europe and is a common crop there. 
   Despite being called for by many recipes, it is of very limited 
   availability here in Southern California, probably because it is 
   so perishable. Sorrel's taste is almost exactly that of the unrelated 
   <a href="ox_oxalis.html#oxalis"><b>Wood Sorrel</b></a>. As with 
   spinach, sorrel's tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

   [Buckler sorrel, Shield-leaf sorrel; Szczaw Tarczolistny (Poland); 
   <i>Rumex scutatus</i>]
   <p>
   This Sorrel is native Europe, and is used primarily in France and 
   Poland. It is most often used in salads, but sometimes for sorrel 
   sauces and other culinary uses, similarly to Garden Sorrel.  As with 
   spinach, sorrel's tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

   [Butter dock, Bluntleaf dock; <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>]
   <p>
   This Sorrel is native Europe, but now also found in North America, 
   Australia and New Zealand. It was once used to wrap farmhouse butter 
   to keep it fresh. The leaves are used in Salads, cooked like Spinach 
   and as an herb in making vegetable stocks. Seeds are used as a spice, 
   and in Romania are sometimes used as the wrapping for Dolma. As with 
   spinach, sorrel's tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

   [Canaigre dock, Ganagra, Wild Rhubarb, Tanner's dock; <i>Rumex 
   hymenosepalus</i> syn. <i>Rumex arizonicus</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the southwest quarter of the United States and to northern 
   Mexico, this plant was once cultivated for its roots, used in tanning 
   leather. Young leaves and stems are eaten raw or cooked, and older 
   stems are cooked as Rhubarb would be. As with spinach, sorrel's 
   tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

<h2>Mountain Sorrel</h2>   
<br><img src="img/cn_mtsorrel03d.jpg" alt="Braid of Mountain Sorrel Leaves" class=mrg>
[Alpine Sorrel; Aveluk (Armenia); <i>Oxyria digyna</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the Arctic tundra, and in mountainous regions 
farther south. Sour tasting and high in vitamin C, It has been important 
to the Inuit to prevent scurvy. It is also appreciated in Armenia where 
it is used for both food and medicinal purposes. The photo specimens are 
braids of leaves from Armenia. The reason for the braids is that they 
are hung up to dry, and as they dry ferment some, improving the flavor. 
They are soaked, washed, chopped and cooked for use in salads or as a 
vegetable flavoring in bulgur pilafs and the like. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rhubarb</h2>
<br><img src="img/ch_rhubarb04e.jpg" alt="Rhubarb Stems" class=mrg>
[pie plant, <i>Rheum rhabarbarum</i> and <i>Rheum rhaponticum</i>]
<p>
Native to northern Central Asia, rhubarb has a long medicinal history but 
use as food did not begin until sugar became affordable in 17th century 
England. It is primarily used for pie filling and combined with 
strawberries for jam. Only the leaf stems (petioles) are used, the leaves 
containing so much oxalic acid they are considered toxic - though you'd 
probably have to eat about 10 pounds to kill you. The photo specimen 
stalks are medium size at about 16 inches long. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Noble Rhubarb</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_rhubnob01k.jpg" alt="Live Noble Rhubarb Plant" class=mrg>
[Sikkim rhubarb; Chuka; <i>Rheum nobile</i>]
<p>
Native to the Hymalayan region at altitudes of 13,000 to 26,000 feet, 
this rhubarb has evolved a unique strategy for success. The flowering 
stem is covered by translucent leaves that pass low frequency light but 
block damaging high altitude ultraviolet. This both protects the 
flowering stem and creates a warm greenhouse effect for development of 
its fruit. The mildly acidic hollow stems are eaten by people in the 
region, and also contain a lot of drinkable water.

<h2>Syrian Rhubarb</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_rhubsyria01h.jpg" alt="Growing Syrian Rhubarb Plants" class=mrg>
[Ribes (Regional languages - variously spelled); Xanjil hagar, Isxun 
(Armenian); Isgin, Isgun (Turkey); Yagmi (Syriac); Cukri (Dari); 
Currant-fruited Rhubarb, Rhubarb of Babilonia; <i>Rheum ribes</i>]
<p>
This wild rhubarb is native to temperate and subtropical Western Asia 
(Turkey to Pakistan) in rocky environments between 3300 and 13,000 feet 
altitude. The most widely eaten part is the mildly acidic flowering stem. 
It can be eaten raw or cooked with eggs or in a stew. The leaves and leaf 
stems are also used in salads in some regions. The plant is gathered in 
the wild and sold in local markets. The roots are perennial and send up 
new leaves and flowering stalks, which can be a little over 3 feet tall. 
As are all rhubarbs, this is considered a medicinal plant.

<h2>Seagrape</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_seagrp01e.jpg" alt="Seagrape Leaves and Fruit" class=mrg>
[Baygrape; <i>Coccoloba uvifera</i>]
<p>
While most used as a landscaping plant in Florida and the Caribbean, this 
plant also produces edible fruit in grape like clusters. The green fruits 
turn reddish when ripe, are tasty and can be eaten fresh. They are also used 
to make jellies and jams, and fermented into wine, which in turn may be 
fermented into seagrape vinegar for use in cooking.

[Indian Knotgrass; <i>Polygonum cognatum</i>]
<p>
Native to Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan this weedy 
creeping herb produces relatively large leaves. It is cultivated in 
Central Anatolia (Turkey) for use in the cuisine of that region.

[Western Bistort, Smokeweed, Mountain meadow knotweed; 
<i>Polygonum bistortoides</i>]
<p>
This plant was an important food item for American Indians in the Mountain 
West. The roots can be eaten raw or roasted and have a flavor resembling 
chestnuts. The seeds can be ground to make bread or cracked and cooked 
into porridge or the like.

<h2>Japanese Knotweed</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_knotjap01e.jpg" alt="Japanese Knotweed Leaves and Stems" class=mrg>
[Itadori (Japan);  <i>Fallopia japonica</i>]
<p>
Along with the closely related Giant Knotweed (<i>F. sachalinensis</i>). 
this plant is most known as an aggressive invasive, though it is favored by 
beekeepers for honey production. In Japan, tender shoots and young leaves 
are eaten. The shoots look much like asparagus but they require peeling 
and special preparation to reduce the oxalic acid. They are also pickled, 
using a natural process of sea salt with nigari (magnesium choloride). 
Japanese and Giant Knotweed are now getting attention as a major source of 
Resveratrol, the anti-aging ingredient in red grape skins. The supplement 
industry prefers knotweed because it grows year round and in many climates.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Sorrel and Rhubarb are made tart by oxalic acid, a substance that 
inhibits absorption of calcium and some other nutrients by the body. In 
the case of rhubarb, the acid level is so high in the leaves they are not 
used, only the leaf stems. Oxalic acid can contribute to formation of 
kidney stones and gout, but is only one of many contributing factors and 
probably not the strongest. Because these vegetables are generally 
consumed infrequently and in small quantity the oxalic acid content 
should not be a problem. The main health problem with rhubarb is that 
it is usually cooked with lots of sugar, a truly dangerous ingredient.
</p>

<p>Buckwheat greens are toxic to humans, causing a number of symptoms 
including extreme skin sensitivity to sunlight. Sprout enthusiasts do eat 
buckwheat sprouts at 4 to 5 days and they seem to be OK, at least in 
modest quantities.</p>
