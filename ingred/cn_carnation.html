<h1>Carnations</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
This page is a catch-all for the almost unbelievably diverse members 
of order <i>Caryophyllales</i>. Aside from the familiar garden carnation 
flower the order includes all the Cacti, the Amaranths, Buckwheat, just 
about all the carnivorous plants - and many more.</p>
<p>The families that have broad culinary usage like the Cacti, Amaranths 
and Buckwheats have their own pages linked from here. The miscellaneous 
ones will be found on this page.

<img src="img/ch_mix03c.jpg" alt="Amaranth Mix" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Family  <i>Amaranthaceae</i>]
</p><p>
The Amaranths have been of culinary interest since prehistoric times the 
world around, but were, and may again be, of great importance in the high 
Andes mountains of South America. The family provides Beets, Sugar Beets, 
Amaranth (seeds and greens), Quinoa, Spinach and other edibles., 
They are important enough as 
food to have their own

<p>[Family <i>Polygonaceae</i>]
</p><p>
Family <i>Polygonaceae</i> has played a very important role in human 
survival, particularly in colder regions at at higher altitudes, both in 
Eurasia and North America. Today use of buckwheat seed is still very 
widespread, particularly for its flavor and association with Russian 
cuisine. Others in the family provide greens and leaf stems appreciated 
for their tart acidic bite. This family has its own

<br><a href="cc_cactus.html">
<img src="img/cc_big03s.jpg" alt="Large Cactus Plant" class=mrg></a>
<p>[family <i>Cactaceae</i>]
</p><p>
Cacti are strictly New World plants, though it is possible one species 
had been taken to Africa by migratory birds. They are an immensely 
interesting family specialized to survive in hot arid environments and 
have now been planted all over the world. They are important enough as 
food to have their own

<h2 class=lrg>Purslane Families</h2>

<img src="img/cn_lewis01k.jpg" alt="Purslane Flowers" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Families <i>Portulacaceae</i>, <i>Montlaceae</i> and <i>Talinaceae</i>]
</p><p>
These families of low growing succulents have worldwide distribution 
and have provided greens and roots in both the New and Old Worlds since 
prehistoric times.  They were all in family <i>Portulacaceae</i> until 
the APG III of 2009 split them apart. In Australasia the seeds have also 
been used to make seed cakes. These unprepossessing plants are of particular 
importance because they grow in poor soil and arid conditions, in both high and 
low altitudes. They now have their own

[Carpet Weeds; Vygies (South Africa, New Zealand); family <i>Aizoaceae</i>]
<p>
This is a large family of succulent plants that originated in arid parts 
of South Africa and southern Angola, though there are a few Australian 
and New Zealand genera. Many species have been taken worldwide as 
decoratives, but a few are also used as food. This family now has its own

<h2>Chickweed</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_chick02e.jpg" alt="Live Chickweed Plant" class=mrg>
[Chickenwort, Craches, Maruns, Winterweed; family <i>Caryophyllaceae</i>, 
<i>Stellaria media</i>]
<p>
Common in both Europe and North America, chickweed is an aggressive 
weed, particularly in tilled or disturbed soil and is difficult to control. 
It is edible though, and nutritious - used as a leaf vegetable and often 
raw in salads. Chickens also like it. The edible chickweed can be identified 
from similar looking varieties by the stem. <i>Stellaria</i> has fine hairs 
on only one side of the stem while other chickweeds have fine hairs all 
around the stem. This plant is also used medicinally.

<h2>Malabar Spinach</h2>
<br><a href="cn_malabarz.html">

[Ceylon / Indian / Surinam / Chinese / Vietnamese Spinach; Broad Bologi,

Genjerot, Jingga, Gendola (Indonesia); Saan Choy (Cantonese); Shan Tsoi, 
Luo Kai, Shu Chieh, Lo Kwai (China); Pui Shak (Bengali); Kodip PasaLi 
(Tamil); Tsuru Murasa Kai (Japan); family <i>Basellaceae</i>, 
<i>Basella alba</i>]
<p>
Not related to regular spinach but rather to cactus and purslane 
(order <i>Caryophyllales</i> (Carnations)), this plant has a similar 
flavor to spinach, but milder without so much oxalic acid. The leaves 
are thick, almost succulent. One cultivar, "Rubra", has red stems.</p>
<p>While regular spinach is a cool temperate plant which doesn't like 
the tropics at all, Malabar Spinach is a tropical vine. A fast growing 
perennial, it is harvested continuously by cutting new growth. It can 
be grown as an annual in warmer temperate regions.

<h2>Mauca</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cn_mauca02e.jpg" alt="Mauka Root Tubers" class=mrg>
[Mauka, Chago, family <i>Nyctaginaceae</i>, <i>Mirabilis expansa</i>]
<p>
Native to the Andes mountains where it was formerly an important food 
crop for the Inca. Once thought to be a "lost crop", it was rediscovered by 
science in the 1960s and 1970s growing in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. It is 
notable for growing well under conditions too harsh for most food crops. 
The leaves are used raw in salads or cooked as greens, 
The root tubers, which can grow up to a few pounds, must be sun dried to 
remove bitterness and astringency, and it then becomes quite sweet. Water 
from cooking the tubers makes a delicious drink. More information, particularly 
on growing this plant (and many others), can be 
found at <a href="http://www.thevegetablegarden.be/">The 
Vegetable Garden</a>.

[Uluuco; Papa lisa (South America); Melloco (Ecuador); Olluco (Peru);

<i>Ullucus tuberosus</i>]
<p>
Native to the Andes mountains where it is cultivated second only to 
potatoes, both the leaves (similar to spinach) and the root tubers (similar 
to potatoes) are used as food.  A characteristic of the tubers is that, 
unlike potatoes, they remain crisp even after they are fully cooked. The 
tubers are also pickled and added to hot sauces.

<h2>Pokeweed</h2>

[Pokeberry, Inkberry, family <i>Phytolaccaceae</i>, <i>Phytolacca 
americana</i>(North America), <i>Phytolacca esculenta</i> (photo) and 
others]
<p>
This generally toxic plant is important to the culinary culture of the 
American South. Young leaves can be eaten as "Poke Salit" after being 
boiled in three changes of water. The seeds are quite toxic but the 
berries are less so, and can be eaten and used to make pies after 
cooking.</p>
<p> Fermented pokeberry juice has been used as ink, and the United 
States Declaration of Independence as well as many Civil War era letters 
were written with this juice.

<h2>Rau Dang Bien</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_raudang02e.jpg" alt="Rau Dang Bien Leaves and Flowers" class=mrg>
[Bitter Leaf, Bitter Herb, Bitter Cumin; Rau Dang (Viet); Jima, Jharasi, 
Peru-n-tiray (India); <i>Glinus oppositifolius</i> of family 
<i>Molluginaceae</i>]
<p>
There is confusion due to more than one Rau Dang (Bitter Leaf), but all 
the Vietnamese sources I've found with photos of culinary usage show 
this one, and it's the one available in Asian markets here in Los 
Angeles. It is a tropical and subtropical plant that grows in very wet 
areas of Africa, South and Southeast Asia and Australia. With rather mild 
bitterness, it is an important flavoring for some Vietnamese soups. It 
is also eaten as a vegetable in parts of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is now grown in Southern California (approval was probably 
delayed by the State's intense suspicion of fast growing water plants 
that clog irrigation channels). The name "Bitter Cumin" comes from the 
cumin shaped seeds. A related species, <i>Glinus lotoides</i>, with 
similar distribution, is similarly used.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rau Dang</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_raudang06h.jpg" alt="Rau Dang Leaves and Flowers" class=mrg>
[Bitter Leaf, Bitter Herb, Prostrate Knotweed, Birdweed, Pigweed; 
Rau Dang (Viet (Bitter Leaf)); <i>Polygonum aviculare</i> of family 
<i>Polygonaceae</i>]
<p>
This plant may or may not have culinary usage in Vietnam (see Rau Dang 
above), but that it is called Rau Dang (Bitter Leaf) is confirmed by the 
Viet version of Wikipedia. In any case, it is sour in taste from oxalic 
acid, and it does have medicinal uses. This plant is a common weed in 
California and many other places worldwide.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rau Ram</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_rauram04e.jpg" alt="Rau Ram Leafy Stems" class=mrg>
[Vietnamese Coriander, Vietnamese mint (not unique), Vietnamese cilantro, 
Cambodian mint, Hot mint; Daun kesum, Daun kesom, Daun Laksa (Malay); 
Phak phai (Thai); Luam laws (Hmong); Phak phaew (Laos); Chi krasang 
tomhom, Chi pong tea koun (Cambodia); Phak-pai (NE India); 
<i>Persicaria odorata</i> syn <i>Polygonum odoratum</i> of family 
<i>Polygonaceae</i>]
<p>
This rangy herb is used throughout Southeast Asia, raw in salads and 
summer rolls, as a garnish and cooked, particularly in soups, but also 
in some stews. It has a slightly resinous taste and is particularly 
associated with Vietnamese cuisine. It is considered a suppressant of 
sexual urges so is often grown by Buddhist monks to make celibacy more 
tolerable. This herb is easily recognized from the spearhead shaped 
leaves with two purplish splotches.

<h2>Sand Verbinas</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_sandvy01h.jpg" alt="Sand Verbina Flowers" class=mrg>
[family <i>Nyctaginaceae</i>, <i>Abronia latifolla</i> (yellow), 
<i>Abronia fragrans</i> (white)]
<p>
Native to the western United States, the sand verbinas produce edible 
roots that may be as large as 24 inches long. The yellow sand verbina is 
native to the coastal region from Southern California to the Canadian 
border. The white is native to the mountain west through about the same 
latitudes.

[Family <i>Droseraceae</i>, <i>Dionaea muscipula</i>]
<p>
Nothing to eat here - it's the one that does the eating. I've included it 
here as an example of just how diverse the order <i>Caryophyllales</i> is. 
Carnivorous habits were developed by several families of this order to 
allow them to flourish in nutrient starved environments.

<h2>Carnations</h2>
<br><img src="img/cn_carnation01h.jpg" alt="Garden Carnation Flowers" class=mrg>
[Clove Pink, family <i>Caryophyllaceae</i>, <i>Dianthus caryophyllus</i>]
<p>
We would be remiss not to include the Carnation itself, even though it is 
not much eaten - after all, it gave it's species name to the entire order. 
It is thought to be native to the Mediterranean region but this is not 
certain because it's been in cultivation for at least 2000 years.
