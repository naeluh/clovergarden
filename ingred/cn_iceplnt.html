<h1>Ice Plant Family</h1>
<br>[Carpet Weeds; Family <i>Aizoaceae</i>]
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
This is a large family of succulent plants, most of which originated in 
arid parts of southern Africa, though a few are native to Australia 
and New Zealand. Many species have been taken worldwide as decoratives, 
but a few are also used as food.

   <h2>New Zealand Spinach</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cn_nzspin01h.jpg" alt="Malabar Spinach Leafy Stems" class=mrg>
   [Warrigal Greens, Sea Spinach, Botany Bay Spinach, Tetragon, Cook's 
   Cabbage; Kokihi (Maori); <i>Tetragonia tetragonioides</i>]
   <p>Native to New Zealand and Australia, this plant is sometimes used as 
   an ornamental ground cover, but it's also edible. There is little evidence 
   the native Maori ate the stuff, but after Captain Cook discovered it he used 
   it fresh and pickled to ward off scurvy in his crew. He took seeds to England 
   and it was soon grown there, in France and in North America, but faded out 
   during the 20th century.</p>
   <p>Today New Zealand spinach is grown by home gardeners in the summer 
   when regular spinach won't grow. It's not a commercial crop in California 
   but is grown commercially in the tropical Americas. Unlike Malabar Spinach 
   which grows long and likes to be trellised, New Zealand is low and spreading. 
   It is usually cooked but can also be used raw in salads.

   <h2>Ice Plant</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cn_ice13e.jpg" alt="Ice Plants with Flower" class=mrg>
   [Freeway Plant (California); Hottentot Fig, Sour Fig (South Africa); 
   Vygies (Afrikaans); <i>Carpobrotus edulis</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   <i>Carpobrotus acinaciformis</i> (less sweet)]
   <p>
   Native to South Africa, this spreading succulent with triangular 
   leaves and brilliant magenta or yellow flowers is now familiar to 
   everyone in California. In the early 1900s it was planted to stabilize 
   soil along railroads, and in the 1960s was extensively planted by 
   Caltrans for freeway landscaping - and now it's everywhere. Few, 
   however, realize both leaves and fruits are edible.</p>
   <p>Early Dutch settlers in South Africa made jams, called Konfyt, 
   out of the fruits of both species listed above, but <i>C. edulis</i> 
   is sweet enough to be eaten fresh.</p>
   <p>Caltrans stopped using it in the 1970s because it was becoming an 
   aggressive invasive in the coastal environment - but there's still 
   thousands of acres of it - and it's presenting the same problems in 
   Australia and the Mediterranian Region.

   <h2>Vetkousies</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cn_carpan01h.jpg" alt="Vetkousies Flower" class=mrg>
   [Yellow Carpet; <i>Carpanthea pomeridiana</i> of family 
   <i>Aizoaceae</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South Africa, this spreading succulent is closely related 
   to the Ice Plant, but its leaves are more flat than triangular. 
   Flowers were used by early Dutch settlers in South Africa in stews 
   called "Bredies". Young leaves were also used in salads.

   <h2>Kanna</h2>

   [Channa, Kougoed; <i>Sceletium tortuosum</i>]
   <p>
   This succulent herb, native to South Africa, is not used for nutrition, 
   but for its mood altering properties. It is reputed to reduce anxiety 
   and supress hunger. Traditionally, it was dried and chewed. Today it's 
   made into gel caps, teas and tinctures - as well as used as snuff and 
   for smoking.  It is said to enhance the effects of other psychoactive 
   herbs, such as cannabies - though it may have adverse effects with 
   alcohol and some other drugs. Study is ongoing.</p>
   <p>North American companies are studying extracts for use in products. 
   One reports "statistically significant improvement in cognitive set 
   flexibility". I interpret this "cognitive flexibility" to mean "more 
   liberal", so the GOP will probably move to have it banned.
