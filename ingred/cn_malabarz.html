<p>
Not related to regular spinach but rather to cactus and purslane 
(order <i>Caryophyllales</i> (Carnations)), this plant has a flavor 
vaguely similar to spinach, but more earthy and much milder due to 
low oxalic acid content. The leaves are thick, almost succulent, and 
actually quite filling. One cultivar, "Rubra", has red stems.</p>
<p>While regular spinach is a cool temperate plant which doesn't like 
the tropics at all, Malabar Spinach is a tropical vine. A fast growing 
perennial, it is harvested continuously by cutting new growth. It can 
be grown as an annual in warmer temperate regions.

<p>This plant is used throughout southern India, Southeast Asia, 
southern China and as far north as Japan. In India it is used in curries, 
it's mucilaginous character acting as a thickener. In Southeast Asia 
it is briefly cooked in stir fries and in soups. It also appears in 
tropical African cuisine as a leafy green vegetable.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Malabar Spinach is now fairly common in Asian 
markets in California, and can sometimes be found at farmer's markets 
if there is an Asian participant.<p></p>

<h3>Storing <small>&amp;</small> Growing:</h3> &nbsp; This plant does 
not store well in the fridge and should be used within 2 days. If you 
need to keep it longer, just cut 1/2 inch off the bottom of the stems 
and place it in a jar with fairly deep water. It will keep a long time, 
and will start to root in less than a week. Rooted plants can be planted 
and will grow vigorously with normal care. You can cut some off now and 
then for cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; 1 pound from a typical bag yielded 13 ounces when 
all stems larger than 1/4 inch were discarded, for a yield of 81%.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For stir fries and the like cook as for regular 
spinach, in just a little oil. Free water on the leaves from washing is 
sufficient to get it cooking. Stir frequently and stop cooking as soon as 
the leaves are limp and of a uniform cooked color. Do not overcook or it 
will become slimy and leave a metallic aftertaste.

<p>In India Malabar Spinach is used as a thickener similar to the way okra 
is, so it's cooked much longer in curries, sambars and the like, and with 
a lot more other ingredients.</p>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Malabar Spinach is high in Vitamin A and C as 
well as Iron and Calcium. It is low in calories but has a good protein to 
calories ratio, and plenty of soluble fiber.<p></p>
