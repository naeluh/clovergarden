[Winter Purslane, Spring Beauty, Indian Lettuce; 
<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>]
<p>
Native to the coastal and mountain regions of western North America, 
from the southern tip of Alaska south as far as Central America, this plant 
is most common in California, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
valleys. It appears in the spring, preferring cool moist ground, and starts 
to dry out in the early summer. It is easily recognizable by the completely 
round leaves with flower spikes extending from the center. This is actually 
formed by two opposed leaves fused together at their edges and appears only 
under the flower head. The regular leaves are spade shaped.</p>
<p> This herb was much used by gold rush miners who ate it to ward off scurvy 
(man cannot live by sourdough bread and salt pork alone). Today it is used 
raw in salads and sometimes cooked as spinach would be. It has a somewhat 
spinach-like taste.  &nbsp; <small>Photo by Curtis Clark distributed

The photo to the left shows basal leaves of a miner's lettuce plant. Later 
leaves may be very elongated ovals, then it sends up a flower stalk 
with the disk leaves (two leaves fused together around the flower stem).
