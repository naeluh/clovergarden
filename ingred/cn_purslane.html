<h1>Purslanes</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg>Purslanes are a fairly large worldwide group of mostly 
succulent herbaceous plants and shrubs, only a few of which are used for 
food.</span> They were all in family <i>Portulacaceae</i>, until the 
APG III system of 2009 split them apart into three families, adding  
<i>Montlaceae</i> and <i>Talinaceae</i>. While molecular biologists saw 
a need for this, we're not going to break up this culinary page. The 
photo shows <i>M. Lewisia rediviva</i>, a North American variety which 
is not used for food.

<h2>Common Purslane</h2>

[Verdolaga (Mexico), Pigweed, Little Hogweed, Pusley; Sanhti, Punarva, 
Kulfa (India); Ma Chi Xian (China); family <i>Portulacaceae</i>, 
<i>P. Portulaca oleracea</i>]
<p>This low growing succulent is native from North Africa through the  
Indian Subcontinent and on to Australasia. It is a common invasive weed 
in North America, particularly California vineyards, but there is some 
evidence it was brought to Canada in pre-Columbian times. By the 20th 
century it had fallen from favor north of the Mexican border, but due to 
shifting demographics is now common in many specialty markets in Southern 
California and elsewhere. Stems, leaves and flower buds are edible and 
often used fresh in salads.

<h2>Water Leaf</h2>

[Ceylon Spinach (not unique); Cariru, Surinam Purslane, Philippine 
Spinach, Florida Spinach, Potherb Fameflower, Lagos bologi; Sweetheart; 
Gbure (Yoruba); Nela basale (Kannada); <i>Talinum fruticosum</i> syn 
<i>Talinum triangulare</i> of family <i>Talinaceae</i>]
<p>
Probably originating in the tropical Americas, this plant is grown as 
a crop in West Africa, South and Southeast Asia and in subtropical parts 
of North and South America. It is an important leaf vegetables in Nigeria 
and is also grown along the Amazon River in Brazil. Having a fairly high 
oxalic acid content it is similar in usage to spinach. As with other 
purslanes, the leaves are somewhat fleshy and mucilaginous.

<h2>Miner's Lettuce</h2>

<img src="img/cn_miners01e.jpg" alt="Flowering Miner's Lettuce Plants" class=mrg></a>
[<i>M. Claytonia perfoliata</i>]
<p>
Native to the western coastal and mountain regions of North America, from 
the southern tip of Alaska south as far as Central America, this plant is 
most common in California, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
valleys. It appears in the spring, preferring cool moist ground, and 
starts to dry out in the early summer. It is easily recognizable by the 
completely round leaves with flower spikes extending from the center, but 
its regular leaves are spade shaped or very elongated ovals.</p>
<p> This herb was much used by gold rush miners who ate it to ward off 
scurvy (man cannot live by salt pork and sourdough bread alone). Today 
it is used raw in salads and sometimes cooked as spinach would be. It 
has a somewhat spinach-like taste.

[Eskimo Potato; Oatkuk (Inuit); Carolina Spring Beauty; <i>M. Claytonia 
tuberosa</i> syn <i>Claytonia caroliniana var tuberosum</i>]
<p>
Native to eastern North America, there are several variations of 
this plant, ranging from the Carolinas well into the Inuit regions of 
Canada, where the tubers of C. Ttuberosa were important food to the 
native people.	The flowers and leaves are also edible.

<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cn_caland01h.jpg" alt="Parakeelya Plant with Flower" class=mrg> 
[<i>M. Calandrinia balonensis</i>]
<p>
A succulent herb native to central Australia. It has fleshy leaves about 
1-1/2 to 4 inches long and brilliant purplish flowers 1 to 1-1/2 inches 
across at the top of long wire-like stems. The Australian Aborigines 
eat the leaves both raw and steamed, and the tuberous roots steamed. The 
seeds are also eaten, ground into a paste.
