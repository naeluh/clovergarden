This herb is used throughout Southeast Asia, raw in salads and summer 
rolls, as a garnish and cooked, particularly in soups, but also in 
some stews. It has a slightly resinous taste and is particularly 
associated with Vietnamese cuisine. It is considered a suppressant of 
sexual urges so is often grown by Buddhist monks to make celibacy more 
tolerable.</p>
<p>This herb is easily recognized from the spearhead shaped leaves with 
two purplish splotches.  If wilted, the herb can be refreshed by total 
immersion in cool water for about 2 hours. The photo specimens, with 
leaves up to almost 2-1/2 inches long, were purchased from a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Most popular in Vietnam, this herb is used in fresh herb platters, 
salads, fish soups and fish stews. In Cambodia it is used in Summer 
Rolls. In Thailand and Laos it is used in raw beef Larb and other Larb. 
In Malaysia and Singapore it is an essential ingredient in a spicy 
noodle soup called Laksa.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Any market serving a Southeast Asian community 
should have this, as it is extensively grown in California. There are 
even reports of potted plants in the garden section of Home Depot.</p>

<p><b>Growing:</b> &nbsp; Fresh stems will root like crazy at the 
stem nodes. Just set in a tall jar jar of water set on a reasonably 
sunny counter. It is reported to survive winters as far north as 
San Francisco.</p>

<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; There is no satisfactory substitute for this 
herb. Though some suggest Cilantro I think Culantro would be better.</p>
