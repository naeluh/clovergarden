<p>
Sorrel grows wild over much of Europe and is a common crop there. Despite 
being called for by many recipes, it is of very limited availability 
here in Southern California, probably due to perishability.  Sorrel's 
taste is almost exactly that of the unrelated

spinach, sorrel's tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

<p>This herb is most used in salads and sauces in England, France and 
Italy. Here in North America, Sorrel has joined the Vietnamese herb 
plate. There is no Vietnamese name, but Viet-Americans call it 
Rau chua (sour herb) or Rau thom (fresh herb).</p>

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; It is very uncommon here in Southern California 
due to uncertain demand and perishability. It is sometimes seen in 
Farmer's Markets, but more reliably at Jon's Market in Glendale, a 
market serving Russian and Armenian communities.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp;  This herb needs to get from field to table 
very promptly before it wilts. Loosely wrapped, it will last a day or 
two in the fridge.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Spinach is considered an imperfect substitute 
because its flavor is more complex and it isn't nearly as tart (many 
European recipes call for a combination of spinach and sorrel).
