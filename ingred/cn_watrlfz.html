This plant originated in the Tropical Americas, from Peru north into 
southern Mexico and east through the Caribbean. It is now grown as a 
leafy vegetable through much of the tropical world. It is one of the 
most important leafy greens in West Africa.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This leaf is mucilaginous, so it, and it's 
substitutes, should be cooked briefly or they may become slimy.
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have not seen this green sold anywhere in 
Southern California. Using a substitute will be necessary in most 
of North America.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; This plant requires a temperature range 
of roughly 60 to 90 Degrees F. and likes an annual rainfall of more 
than 200 inches, so isn't likely to succeed outside the tropics.
<p></p>  

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Malabar Spinach, Common Purslane (closely 
related), Lamb's Lettuce (not closely related). 
<a href="cn_purslz.html"><b>Purslane</b></a> is available in markets 
serving a Latin American community, usually labeled "Verdolaga". 
<a href="cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> is available 
in Asian markets, particularly those serving a Southeast Asian community.

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2> &nbsp; Waterleaf is high 
in vitamins A and C as well as iron and calcium, but this green should be 
eaten in moderation. It has a fairly high amount of calcium oxalate in a 
soluble form, which could be a problem for people with kidney disorders, 
gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. It also contains hydrocyanic acid, but 
that is destroyed by cooking. Caution should be used in feeding Water 
Leaf to infants as it has substantial amounts of nitrates and nitrites 
to which they are sensitive.<p></p>
