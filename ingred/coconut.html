<h1>Coconut</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The coconut palm (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>) is native to the coastal 
regions of tropical Southeast Asia. The seeds of this tall slender tree 
can float for months so ocean currents have carried it far and wide and 
commerce has carried it even farther. It is now grown in just about 
every suitable tropical region in the world.</p>
<p>Coconut is not just important to the cuisines of the regions where 
it grows, but to the very survival of the people. The fruit provides 
protein, calories, minerals, vitamins and flavors. From it come 
beverages, oil for cooking and even the fire over which to cook. The 
shells make containers, the fronds provide roofing material and the 
trunks provide building lumber.

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Types of Coconuts</h2>

<p><img src="img/pm_coco14h.jpg" alt="Three types of Whole Coconuts" class=mrg>
Shown are the three forms whole coconuts are sold in: fresh (left, 5 inches 
diameter, 2-1/3 pounds, very full), brown (front, 4-3/4 inches diameter, 
1-3/4 pounds, still quite full) and fresh young (right 5 inches diameter, 
2-1/2 pounds).</p>

<h2>Fresh Coconut</h2> and <h2>Brown Coconut</h2> are 
bought for the white flesh (called "copra") they contain. A fresh coconut 
still has a lot of water in it, palatable, but not as sweet as that of 
the fresh young coconut. The brown coconut will have less water and that 
water will be even less sweet, but still drinkable if there is a lot of 
it. The flesh of the brown coconut is harder and has a more intense 
flavor than that of the fresh coconut which is too soft and light in 
flavor for many recipes, and particularly for making coconut milk.<p></p>


<h2>Fresh Young Coconuts</h2> are sold for the water they contain, which 
is sweeter and more flavorful than that of older coconuts. They are 
trimmed as shown and a lot of the weight is wet fiber. They should 
be sold tightly wrapped in plastic film to retain moisture. The shell is 
still too soft to stand the fiber being ripped off, and the flesh 
is thin and so soft you can eat it with a spoon. The flesh has much 
less flavor and sweetness than that of a mature coconut. They are often 
sold by street vendors with a hole punched into them for a straw. This 
water, usually with flakes of the pulp, is widely available in cans (see 
products below). A 2-1/2 pound coconut will yield about 1-1/2 cups of 
water and 4 ounces of flesh (used in some recipes along with the water).
<p></p> 

<h2>Mutant Gelatinous Coconut</h2>
<br>[Macapuno, Kopyor] &nbsp; This coconut is available in the 
Philippines and Indonesia where it is used for various desserts. It may 
be found preserved in syrup in stores catering to Philippine communities. 
The flesh of this coconut does not harden but stays gelatinous.<p></p>
<br>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Coconuts</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>IF</b> you really depend on having a coconut for a recipe, buy a 
  spare to make sure you have a good one - its cheap insurance and if 
  you don't use it you can always eat it.</li>
<li><b>Don't buy</b> brown coconuts that don't still slosh when you 
  shake them - the more water the better. A dry coconut is a moldy or 
  rotten coconut.</li>
<li><b>Fresh Coconuts</b> can be so full of water they barely slosh at 
  all. I have purchased some that were really a bit too young with meat 
  that was still rather soft and lacked flavor. They should probably 
  have enough air in them to slosh a bit.</li>
<li><b>Don't buy</b> a coconut (fresh or brown) that's bleeding at the 
  eyes, it's rotten inside. The brown coconut in the photo above looked 
  just fine in the store but proved to have just a little seep at one 
  eye. It was rotten.</li>
<li><b>Don't buy</b> a coconut with a crack in the shell, it's probably 
  moldy inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fresh Coconuts</b> will keep as long as 3 weeks but will start to 
turn brown and may crack. Keep them in a dry place or the fibers on the 
outside will mold. <b>Brown Coconuts</b> can also be kept a couple weeks 
if they still have plenty of water but not so long that they dry out.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="prep" class=lrg>Preparing Coconuts</h2>

<p><img src="img/pm_coco17h.jpg" alt="Fresh Coconut Broken Open" class=mrg>
Preparing coconuts for use is simple but requires mechanical dexterity 
and strength. If you don't feel up to it have someone accustomed to 
sing tools do it (some husbands are good for this, but others will just 
injure themselves).</p>
<h3 id="yield">Yield:</h3> &nbsp;  A mature coconut should yield about 
12 oz of copra (coconut meat) after shelling and peeling off the brown 
backing. This is equivalent to about 4 oz dried coconut. Dried grated 
coconut runs about 4 oz to one cup lightly packed so a whole coconut 
will be about 1 cup of dried grated coconut. So if an Indian recipe 
calls for "1/2 dried coconut grated", figure about 2 oz of dried grated 
coconut or 6 oz of fresh.<p></p>
<p>A fresh coconut will also yield about 1-1/2 cups of coconut water 
which is used in only a few recipes, so it's for the cook. Pour it into 
a 2 cup glass measuring cup and chill it up in the freezer with a 
judicious dollop of chilled vodka poured in. It'll improve your 
disposition and nobody'll suspect a thing, "Its just coconut water".</p>
<p>Here are the steps for preparing a coconut, but for more detail and 
pictures see our <a href="pm_cocomz.html"><b>Coconut Milk</b></a>  
page.<br class=cll></p>
<ol>
<li>Use a 3/8 inch drill bit and drill through an eye (the weakest point 
- three eyes are found at the stem end), or better, two eyes. Pour out 
the water through the hole. Lacking a drill, use a hammer to pound a 
large phillips screwdriver or similar through an eye. The water must be 
clear and colorless - if it has any color at all your coconut is rotten. 
For a reasonably fresh coconut the water should be pleasant to drink.
<p></p></li>
<li>At this point, if it's convenient, you could put the coconut in a 
preheated oven at 350&deg;F/177&deg;C for 20 minutes. This will loosen 
the flesh from the shell making it much easier to remove, and will 
likely crack the coconut making it much easier to open.<p></p></li>
<li>Place the coconut on a strong hard surface and wrap a towel around it 
to make it easy to hold in place. <b>Careful how you hold it</b> because 
a hammer blow may open a crack that springs shut and could pinch your 
skin - so use the towel. If you don't have a coconut grater you'll 
probably want to break it into several pieces.<p></p></li>

<li><img src="img/ke_cocograter01.jpg" alt="Hand Coconut Grater" class=mrg>
<b>IF</b> you have a real coconut grater, you can just grate the coconut 
out of the shell (most recipes call for grated coconut anyway) and 
you're ready to cook - but you probably don't have a real coconut 
grater, hand cranked or otherwise, so you'll have to go through a few 
more steps. I have it from an Indian lady that those hand cranked 
graters are a real pain to use anyway.
<br class=cll></li>
<li>Now comes the hard part - prying the flesh out of the shell. By far 
the best and safest tool is a dull 1/2 inch wood chisel (bevel side to 
the shell) but a short strong knife like an oyster knife will do. In any 
case the objective is <b><u>to not stab yourself in the process</u></b>. 
Be careful.<p></p></li>
<li>Once you have the flesh out, you will want to peel off the brown 
skin that came out with the flesh. You can use a "Y" 
<a href="../ke/kn_peelz.html"><b>Vegetable Peeler</b></a>, or a large 
<a href="../ke/ke_grtslcz.html#micrp"><b>Microplane</b></a> or similar.
<p></p></li>
<li>At this point the coconut flesh can be let dry a bit, then wrapped 
and stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Longer and it will get 
moldy. Of course you can freeze it for keeping longer. I often grate 
the coconut before freezing it.<p></p></li>
<li>Most recipes call for grated coconut. Because the pieces break up 
easily a flat grater is as likely to produce bloody knuckles as grated 
coconut. For small quantities you can use a rotary grater with a 
flapper to push the coconut pieces against the drum, either an 
attachment for you mixer (preferred) or a hand rotary grater (like a 
cheese grater). You may have to clean the drum a couple of times 
because it clogs and you'll lose some coconut because when pieces get thin enough they 
slip around the drum. <b>Best</b> is to use an 
<a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Indian Mixie</b></a>, but a Mini-Prep food 
processor or the sharp blade in your regular food processor long enough 
will work, but take longer. My Mixie does half a coconut to a fine 
grind in 2-1/2 seconds.<p></p></li>
<li>Depending on the recipe you may want to chop grated coconut to make it 
finer or grind it with a mortar and pestle (or if you used the sharp blade of 
your food processor just let it run until it's as fine as you can get it).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Fresh Young Coconut</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_cocoy04e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Fresh Young Coconut" class=mrg>
These are nuts that are not yet mature. The flesh is jelly-like and lacks 
flavor, while the water, which fills the whole cavity, is very sweet. The 
photo to the left shows a whole nut from the tree, a similar nut cut in 
half, and a trimmed and bleached nut, the form normally found in markets.

<p>Fresh young coconut will keep a week or so, but since the whole 
objective is the fresh juice inside, you want to minimize storage - the 
longer the storage the less juice. If kept moist the fiber on the outside 
will mold, and since the shell is very soft, mold could penetrate to the 
flesh and juice. If you keep it dry it'll dry out.</p>
<p>The water is a little less clear than from a mature coconut and it's 
quite a bit sweeter. If you split the coconut open you can eat the 
flesh with a spoon. It is thin, in some areas it may be so thin you can 
see shell through it. The jelly like flesh is pleasant enough to eat but 
it can't be used in any normal coconut recipe because the flavor is just 
too light.
<br class=cll></p>

<ol>
<li>Take a 3/8 inch drill bit and drill two holes, anywhere, or punch 
  through with a hammer and phillips screwdriver (the shell is soft). 
  Pour out the water and put it in the fridge to chill.<p></p></li>
<li>The proper way to open a fresh young coconut is to set it on a stump 
  and slash it cleanly through with a single stroke of a machete. My 
  aim with a machete isn't that practiced, so I drive a sharp Chinese 
  cleaver knife through it with a soft faced mallet.<p></p></li>
<li>Scoop the flesh out with a spoon.<p></p></li>
<li>See "fresh coconut" above for what to do with the water (you do keep 
a bottle of vodka chilled in the freezer, don't you) - or you can drink 
it chilled and straight up (the coconut water, not the vodka). Commercial 
young coconut water usually has little chips of the flesh in it.</li>
