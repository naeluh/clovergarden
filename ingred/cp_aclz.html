<h1>Anatolia, Caucasus, Levantine Chilis</h1>
<br><img src="img/cp_shatth08f.jpg" alt="Shatta Chilis, whole, cut" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>
The various ethnicities of Anatolia, Caucasus and the Levant may not get 
along real well, but their ingredients and cuisines overlap substantially 
into a coherent region. Egypt, on the other hand, is in North Africa, 
but has strongly influenced the Levant.
</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, the Turks got chilis from Portuguese traders 
in the 1500s, and they spread from there to the Levant, Caucasus and 
Balkan regions, and as far as Hungary.</p>

<p>Countries included in this section are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Israel, and possibly some Egypt.</p>

<h2>Armenian / Turkish Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_armo09e.jpg" alt="Whole Armenian / Turkish Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>
Fresh yellow-green, up to 8 inches by 2 inches but more commonly 
stubbier at 5 to 6 inches by 2 inches diameter, tapered with a usually 
blunt end. These are noticeably sweet when they start to yellow but can 
have detectable hotness ((<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0 to 
H1</b></a>). They have thinner skins, thinner walls and a more subtle 
flavor than Bell Peppers, so are good for frying and roasting, similar 
to Italian Frying Peppers. They are very like the sweet Hungarian Green 
pepper, which stands to reason, since the Hungarians got their peppers 
from the Turks. They can be considered interchangeable with those chilis.

<h2 id="alep">Aleppo Pepper</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_aleppo01h.jpg" alt="Whole Aleppo Pepper on Plant" class=mrg>
[Halaby (Arab); <i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>
This important pepper has been long grown around the city of Aleppo in 
northern Syria, after which it is named. The Arab name, Halaby, is also 
named for the city, which was called Halab in ancient times. Most are 
now grown in Turkey due to the endless warfare that has destroyed much 
of Aleppo and the surrounding region.	This chili is not much used fresh, 
most being processed into Aleppo Chili Flake. This is a fairly hot chili 
at <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>, but the flake made from 
it is much milder as the seeds and veins are removed.

<h2>Aleppo Chili Flake</h2> 
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_alepexh01h.jpg" alt="Ground Aleppo Chili Flake" class=mrg>
[Haleb Biber (Armenia); Pul Biber (Turk)]
<p>
This is the form most Aleppo Pepper is sold in. Here in Southern 
California there was once only the Mild version, but now both Mild and 
Hot are available (2019), though actually there isn't a lot of 
difference. The flake is not nearly as hot as the chilis themselves, 
due to seed and vein removal in the process. This flake is made by salt drying 
the fresh chilis until they are partially dry. They are then opened and 
the seeds and veins are removed. The last steps are to sun dry and then 
grind to flake. The flake is just a little salty from this process. 
Subst: Ground Ancho Chili with a little salt is considered the most 
acceptable substitute.

<h2 id="shat">Shatta Chili</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_shatth08e.jpg" alt="Red Shatta Chilis, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>
In Palestine and Egypt, a chili sauce called "Shatta" is made, which 
may or may not be made using Shatta Chilis, as the word "Shatta" is 
simply a word for "Red" in Arabic. This means there may be other 
Chilis in the region also called "Shatta". This plant is small, but is 
a good producer. Unlike most chilis this large, they grow point up. 
The photo specimens were up to 1.9 inches long and 0.55 inch diameter. 
These chilis are just moderately hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>).

<h2 id="aci">Aci Sivri Biber</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_acisiv01h.jpg" alt="Red Aci Sivri Peppers on Bush" class=mrg>
[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili is very popular in Turkey, and has spread into the Balkans 
and Eastern Europe, and no doubt into Armenia. "Sivri Biber" just means 
"Hot Pepper" in Turkish. They are long and narrow, growing as long as 
9 inches. Their hotness is a bit unpredictable, but can be as low as 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a> and as high as 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>. The plant can grow to 3 
feet high, and is very productive. &nbsp; <small>Photo borrowed from

<h2>Red Fresno Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis, whole, cut" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (some U.S. supermarkets); <i>Capsicum. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili <u>IS NOT</u> from the Anatolia, Caucasus, Levantine region, 
but all the ethnic communities in Southern California seem to have 
found it suitable for their cuisines, wherever a medium hot fresh red 
chili is needed. While California chili growers produce over a dozen 
kinds of fresh green chilis, this, and the tiny Thai chilis, are about it 
for red ones. The hotness of Fresno chilis is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>, but they are easily 
disarmed by removing the seed core and membranes. The attractive flavor 
of this chili remains.  If a long narrow shape is needed, you'll have to 
track down Holland Reds, sometimes sold in the 
big chain supermarkets. Fresnos are most reliably found in Asian markets, 
particularly Korean and Southeast Asian. For details see our
