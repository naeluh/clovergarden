<h1>Chilis <small>of</small> Africa</h1>
<br><img src="img/cp_habayr02e.jpg" alt="Whole Red amd Yellow Habanero Chilis" class=mrg>

In West Africa, Chilis are commonly called "Peppers", which causes 
considerable confusion. There are various other "Peppers" in the region, 
some of which are related to Black Pepper and others are not - but none 
are at all related to Chilis.

<p>All the Chilis of Africa came from Mexico, Central America, 
South America, and the Caribbean. The nearest relative to the Chilis 
indigenous to Africa is the Eggplant.</p>

<br>
<img src="img/cp_bakl02h.jpg" alt="Large Red Tunisian Baklouti Chilis, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is the favorite chili for making the famous Harissa Sauce of 
Tunisia, which has spread to the rest of the Maghreb region. It was 
probably developed from chilis brought by the Spanish during their 
occupation of Tunisia between 1535 and 1574. The larger in the photo 
was 4.2 inches long and 1.1 inches diameter, with hotness about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>. The flesh is sweet and thin 
enough to dry well.

<p>[Piri Piri, (Portugal, Africa); Ata Wewe (Yoruba - Nigeria); 
(<i>C. frutescens</i>]</p>
<p>
Up to 2 inches long, these are standard Bird Chilis, brought to Africa 
by the Portuguese, and are used under the same name in Portugal as well. 
They are quite hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). They are not 
marketed to any extent in North America, so you must grow your own or 
use a substitute. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: 
<a href="cp_africz.html#thai"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> are not as hot but much more 
available in North America.

<br><img src="img/cp_habared06e.jpg" alt="Red Habanero Chilis, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[<i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>Frequently used in Tanzania and Congo, but not much in Kenya and Uganda. 
These are Habenero type chilis. They may be wrinkled as in the photo, or 
longer and smoother. Red seems preferred, but green and orange are also 
used. They are quite hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>). Here 
in California, red are often not available, but the <a href="cp_africz.html#haba"><b>Orange 
Habanero</b></a> always is, and works fine unless color is important.

<h2 id="camer">Cameroon Pepper</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_camar02h.jpg" alt="Camaroon Peppers" class=mrg>
[Black Pepper (Nigeria); <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
These are actually dried Yellow Scotch Bonnet / Habanero chilis. While 
these chilis are not normally good subjects for drying, northern 
Cameroon, adjacent to Nigeria, has a climate hot and dry enough to do the 
job. The photo examples are not as dark and dull as those from Africa 
because they were dried in my electric dehydrator, so didn't have time 
for the colors to degrade. This chili is also often sold in flake or 
powder form. It is extremely hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10">
<b>H10</b></a>).

<br><img src="img/cp_ijosi02h.jpg" alt="Dried Ata Ijosi Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>[(Yoruba - Nigeria)]</p>
<p>
<b>Ata Ijosi</b> (pictured <i>C. frutescence</i>) is a very small Bird Pepper, 
hotness about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>. They are now very 
popular in Nigeria, fresh and dried, especially for 
<a href="../recipes/qjv_atadd2.html"><b>Ata DinDin</b></a> sauce. Ata Ijosi 
are up to 0.75 inch long and 0.32 inches wide, and are sometimes available 
on-line in North America.</p>
<p><b>Ata Wewe</b> (<i>C. frutescence</i>) as best I can find, is Yoruba for 
<a href="cp_africz.html#perip"><b>Peri Peri</b></a> Chilis, fresh and dried 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). It seems to be more popular 
than Ata Ijosi, perhaps more available.</p>

<br><img src="img/cp_cayenne06e.jpg" alt="Fresh green and red Cayenne Chilis" class=mrg>
[Ose Nkiri (Nigeria); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Originating in French Guiana, this famous chili has been used to make the 
Cayenne chili powder used in many cuisines - except that powder is at 
least as likely to be made from some other variety and just labeled 
"Cayenne". Today there are many cultivars, but the Cayenne pod is 
generally long and thin, up to nearly 10 inches, often curved at the tip, 
and ripens pointing down. It is quite hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">
<b>H8</b></a>). <u>Subst</u>: <a href="cp_africz.html#thai"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a>, 
which are a Cayenne type cultivar. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="haba">Habaneros</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_habayr02h.jpg" alt="Whole Red amd Yellow Habanero Chilis" class=mrg>
[Ose Oyibo, Atarodo, Ata Rodo (Nigeria); Pilipili Mbuzi (Tanzania, Congo); 
<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
Originally from the Yucat&aacute;n of Mexico, this extremely hot chili 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>) is one of the most important 
chilis in the Caribbean Islands and along the Caribbean coast of South 
America. Due to the slave trade they were taken to West Africa along 
with the nearly identical Scotch Bonnets. The two are now the dominant 
chilis in the region. They come in Green, Red, Orange and Yellow, with 
White, Purple and "Chocolate" varieties known. Shape can vary radically. 
Those always available here in Southern California are the Habanero 
Orange variety, which is more wrinkly than the photo specimens.The 
name Habanero means "from Havana", but hot chilis have fallen out 
of favor in Cuba.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Habanero, Orange</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_habanor03h.jpg" alt="Orange Habaneros, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
If you live in Southern California, this Orange Habanero is what you 
will be using. It totally dominates the market here, and other varieties 
are seldom seen. On the other hand, I haven't heard any complaints about 
that. Every market serving a Latino community has a bin of them, and 
Asian markets have at least foam trays of them. Appaerently they are 
considered adequate for the job - high heat and good fruity flavor.

<br><img src="img/cp_kpakpo02h.jpg" alt="Green and Red Kpakpo Chilis" class=mrg>
[Pettie Belle, Cheeky; <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This chili is very popular in Ghana, Africa, usually used green, but 
also sometimes red. They are quite wrinkled and often squat, very 
much the shape of the Habanero Orange chilis we have here in Southern 
California, but quite a bit smaller. They are also not nearly as hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>), similar to Cayenne or Thai 
Chilis. While one of the mildest Habaneros, they are described as having 
a unique spicy and fragrant taste. They are not currently available in 
North America. I have manged to get seeds (July 2022) and hope to have 
chilis fairly soon.

<br><img src="img/cp_bellsg02h.jpg" alt="Small Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
[Pilipili hoho (Tanzania); <i>Capsicum annuum</i> var <i>grossum</i>]
<p>
Basically these are medium size Bell Peppers, same as ours, and 
are generally used green (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>). 
&nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: &nbsp; None required, we have plenty of green bell 
peppers in North America, and even some medium size ones.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Red Bell Pepper</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_bellr02h.jpg" alt="Red Bell Peppers, blocky and elongated" class=mrg>
[Pilipili hoho (Tanzania); <i>Capsicum annuum</i> var <i>grossum</i>]
<p>
Many markets in Nigeria sell both squat and elongated Red Bell Peppers 
as "Tatashe". No less an expert than Flo Madubike states firmly this is 
not correct, and the two are <u>not</u> interchangeable in recipes. While 
both are mild peppers, the <a href="cp_africz.html#tat"><b>Tatashe</b></a> has thinner 
walls and a flavor that is more intense and much more chili-like. 
Our <a href="cp_mexiz.html#anaheim"><b>Red Anaheims</b></a> would probably 
be much closer than red bell peppers.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Scotch Bonnet</h2>

[Bonnie Pepper, Scotty Pepper; Ose Oyibo, Atarodo (Nigeria); 
Ball-of-fire (Guyana); Aji Chombo (Panama); <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This chili is often confused with the Habanero, but is a different 
cultivar, though only in the Caribbean do people claim to be able to 
tell the difference. It is the same hotness 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>) as the Habanero, but with a 
somewhat sweeter and smokier flavor. In appearance, it is very rumpled. 
It got its name from a formerly common (now rare) variety in Jamaica that 
was of a flattened disk shape said to look like a Scottish hat. Today, 
due to the meddling of chili growers, they come in many shapes, colors 
and levels of hotness. The largest in the photo was 2 inches long, 1.4 
inches diameter, and weighed 5/8 ounce.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="shom">Shombo Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_cayenne06e.jpg" alt="Whole Red Cayenne Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>Every market in Nigeria seems to have a different idea as to what a 
Shombo Chili is, but all pretty much agree it's red and hot. The chili 
that's shown most often is a long somewhat stout Cayenne type like those 
in the photo to the left, sometimes even called Cayenne. Others show 
long thin Cayenne peppers, and some show small pointed red chilis. 
Chilis of this type and shape are not much available in North America, 
so I suggest using the red chilis every ethnicity in Southern California 
seems to feel is fine for their cuisine, the <a href="cp_africz.html#fresno">
<b>Red Fresno Chili</b></a> or the <a href="cp_africz.html#thai"><b>Thai Chili</b></a> 
depending on the hotness you want. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="tat">Tatashe Pepper:</h2>

[Tatashe (Nigeria); Pilipili Hoho (Swahili); Romano Pepper; Red Bell 
Pepper (common error); <i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<p>
This is a large conical red pepper with low heat 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H1-H2</b></a>?), growing 
to 10 inches long. It is not available in North America, but our 
<a href="cp_mexiz.html#anaheim"><b>Red Anaheim</b></a>  peppers may be 
an acceptable substitute (perhaps a little hotter). In Nigeria it is 
often called "Red Bell Pepper", but reliable sources say that is 
definitely wrong and they are not interchangeable. The Tatashe, though 
similarly mild, has thinner walls and a more intense and more chili-like 
flavor. The confusion is so great some recipe writers, when they call 
for "Tatashe" add "the long pointed one". Also see

[Peppadew&reg; Pepper, Malawi Piquant&eacute;, Sweet Piquant&eacute; Pepper; 
<i>Capsicum baccatum</i>]
<p>this is a small, roughly spherical, fairly thick walled chili with rather 
moderate heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>). It is 
grown commercially in Limpopo province of South Africa. It originated in South 
America, but was discovered in South Africa on a property formerly owned by a 
botanist. Actual flavor is very similar to Red Bell Pepper, but with heat. 
The largest in the photo was 1.45 inches long x 1.22 inches diameter.</p>
<p>This pepper is best known in it's pickled form, produced by 
Peppadew International in South Africa and sold as Peppadew&reg; Peppers.

["Red Jalapeno" (some U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Not an African Chili. This chili has been found just fine by pretty much 
every ethnic community in Southern California. It is available in most ethnic 
markets, particularly Korean, Southeast Asian, and Latin American. I have 
seen it on European lists, so it is apparently invading there. It is quite 
hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>), but, can be easily and 
almost entirely disarmed by capping, splitting, and carefully removing 
the seed mass and the internal membranes. Thus disarmed it should be 
a fine substitute for the Tatashe Pepper (see above), though they are 
smaller so you need to use more of them.  For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.

<h2 id="serra">Serrano Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Serranos" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Not an African Chili. This is our "go-to" Chili for wherever "hot green 
chilis" are expected but not identified. Native to the mountains of Mexico, 
these have more flavor than hot green chilis in most of the world, but within 
reason.  Serranos are fairly hot (about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6">
<b>H6</b></a>), but the heat can be much reduced if necessary, by removing 
the seed mass and membranes. They are usually used green with the seeds in. 
They can be up to 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. 
The flesh is fairly thick, so they are not dried, though they are often 
pickled.

[Cuaresmenos (Mexico); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Not an African Chili, but nearly all recipes from Ethiopia, Eritrea 
and Somalia I have seen written in English call for Jalape&ntilde;os. This 
Chili must satisfy the requirements of people who are "from there", so that's 
what I use for that region. Fresh green, 2 to 3 inches by 1 inch diameter, 
dark green with blunt tip, hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h5">
<b>H5-H6</b></a>. The skin is dark green (or red), smooth and shiny but often 
has faint stretch marks (corking). Those with corking tend to be hotter. For 
details see our <a href="cp_jalapz.html"><b>Jalap&ntilde;o, Chipotle &amp; 
Morita Chilis</b></a> page.

[Rat Turd Chili; Mak Pet Ki Nuu (Laos); Nga Yut Thee (Burma); Scuds 
(some chefs); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Not an African Chili. Thai Chilis are the chilis universally used as "small 
fresh chili", green or red, by all the ethnic communities here in Southern 
California. It is also displacing Bird Chilis in other parts of the world due 
to being easier to grow and harvest, so it's probably grown in Africa by 
now.</p>
<p>It is small, often less than 1-3/4 inches long as grown in Thailand, 
but there are many varieties and those grown in California are often up 
to 2-3/4 inches (more efficient to grow and harvest larger sizes). They 
are narrow, pointy and start growing point up, but turn downward as they 
reach full size. They turn from green to red when ripe (they may be 
somewhat orange in between). They are very hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">
<b>H8 to H9</b></a>), slightly less hot when red ripe, and a little less than 
that when dried. Fully red ripe prik ki nu dry very well. Those imported from 
Thailand tend to be hotter than if you dried those grown in California. 
Some minor varieties are black if in full sun, turning bright orange when 
ripe.
