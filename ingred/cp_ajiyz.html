<h1>Aji Amarillo</h1>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajiamar06g.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Aji Amarillo Chilis" class=mrg>
[Peruvian yellow chili; <i>C. baccatum</i> var. <i>pendulum</i>]
<p>
This chili is most commonly associated with Peru but is also used 
in Bolivia. The <i>baccatum</i> species originated in Peru and/or 
Bolivia and still dominates the Andes region today. The name means 
"Chili Yellow". It ripens to a bright orange. Some sources say they turn 
yellow ("amarillo") when cooked, but they actually stay pretty orange. 
This is a moderately hot variety (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">H4</a>) 
and grows to 3 
to 6 inches long. In Peru they are used mostly fresh, but in Bolivia 
they are dried and ground. A number of products are made from this 
chili, see below. </p>

<p>The photo specimens were from my own plants, grown from seeds of a 
dried aji amarillo imported from South America. The largest of the photo 
specimens was 6 inches long and 7/8 inch diameter. Hotness seems rather 
uneven, but is toward the mild side.	I have purchased frozen Aji 
Amarillos that were from a shorter fatter cultivar, than the ones I 
used seeds from.</p>

<p>The seeds I planted sprouted well, but the plants didn't do all that 
well their first year here in Southern California. They produced only 
a few chilis which ripened very slowly and unevenly. The second year 
they produced a pretty good yield. Their third year they produced almost 
nothing, but by then I had learned that many chili plants need to be 
cut back drastically after harvest. I cut these way back, and now, in 
their fourth year, they are flowering well and starting to set fruit.

<h3>Aji Amarillo Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This product (to the right in 
photo) is widely available here in Los Angeles, in 8 ounce jars. Nearly 
every specialty market serving a significant Latino community (and our 
Latino communities around here <u>are</u> significant - even the 
Republicans are starting to notice) carries this product. It is suitable 
for use as a substitute for fresh chilis in most recipes. Ingred: 
Yellow chili, Salt, Citric Acid (and potassium sorbate (E202) in some 
brands). It should be refrigerated after opening.
<p></p>

<h3>Aji Amarillo Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This bottled sauce (left in 
photo) is basically the same as the paste, but cut with vinegar. Oddly, 
I haven't found it here in Los Angeles yet, but I've ordered it from 
Amigo Foods in Florida. It has a very good fruity flavor, like an 
habanera sauce without all that hotness. It's so mild I can drink it, 
but if you're from the Frozen North, maybe you wouldn't want to. Ingred: 
yellow chili, vinegar, salt, xanthan gum (thickener).

<h3>Aji Amarillo, Frozen:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimens, bought 
frozen from a latino market in Los Angeles, were 4-1/2 inches long by 
1.4 inches diameter, a shorter, plumper cultivar than the dried ones 
shown above. They were a suitable substitute for fresh ones in any 
cooked recipe.

<br><img src="img/cp_ajiamaril05h.jpg" alt="Dried whole chilis" class=mrg>
<h3>Aji Mirisol:</h3> &nbsp; These are dried Aji Amarillo. The 
photo specimens, purchased from Catalina's Market in Los Angeles, were 
typically 4.3 inches long by 1.15 inches across. Seeds from one of 
these were planted to produce the photo specimens at the top of the 
page.<br class=cll><p></p>

<br><img src="img/cp_ajimirap01h.jpg" alt="Aji Mirisol Paste" class=mrg>
<h3>Aji Mirisol Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This paste is much less common 
than the Aji Amarillo Paste, but is available on-line. It is called for 
by some Peruvian recipes. It is made from dried Mirasol chilis. Naturally, 
it is of medium heat, just a little less than the Aji Amarillo paste. 
Ing: Mirasol hot pepper, water, salt, citric acid, potassium sorbate, 
sodium benzoate.<br class=cll><p></p>

<br><img src="img/cp_ajiamaril09h.jpg" alt="Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<h3>Aji Amarillo Powder:</h3> &nbsp; In Peru, Aji Amarillo are 
usually used fresh, but the dried chili powder is much used in Bolivia. 
Many recipes for Peruvian dishes do call for the powder, presuming you 
can't get the fresh chilis or paste. I haven't found this product here 
in Los Angeles, despite the huge spice and chili displays in the stores. 
The dried Aji Amarillo pods are, however, easily available, so I just 
grind a few of those in my spice grinder.

<h3>Aji Amarillo, Canned:</h3> &nbsp; Available in both cans and 
jars, this product is pretty much the same as the paste, but not ground 
up. These can be used as a substitute for fresh chilis in any recipe 
where they will be cooked, but you need more texture than with paste - 
or they can be used in salads. These are available in some stores here 
in Los Angeles, or can be ordered on the Internet (compare prices). 
Ingred: yellow chili, water, salt, citric acid. Refrigerate after 
opening.
