<h1>Chilis <small>of the</small> Caribbean</h1>
<br><img src="img/cp_sbon10e.jpg" alt="Red Scotch Bonnet Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>
This region is known for liberal use of stingingly hot chilis, but also 
includes some that are surprisingly mild. Some of these chilis have 
been carried far and wide, to the extent the predominant chilis in 
West Africa are the Caribbean Habanero and Scotch Bonnet..</p> 

<p>We include here all the islands of the Caribbean, despite their 
differences. While most make liberal use of hot chilis, Cuba, Dominican 
Republic and Puerto Rico favor mild chilis. We also include the mainland 
countries of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Their populations are 
concentrated on the Caribbean Coast, and they are inextricably tied to 
the cultures and cuisines of the Caribbean. They are in the Hot Chilis 
camp.</p>

<p>Some chilis of the region are called "Aji" (pronounced Ah-hee). This 
word is from the Taino word "ax&iacute;". The Taino were the original 
inhabitants of much of the Caribbean, but were driven almost extinct by 
Spanish cruelty and diseases they brought.</p>

<p>
This chili is a variety of the fiercely hot Scotch Bonnet, but very mild. 
It still has the tropical fruity taste of the Scotch Bonnets and 
Habaneros. It is much used in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Dominican Republic 
where hot chilis are not much appreciated. In South America it is most 
widely used in Venezuela, but also in Colombia on the Caribbean coast. 
In some recipes of this coastal region, a number of Aji Dulce will be 
combined with one hot Scotch Bonnet or Habanero.

While fresh Aji Dulce Chilis are hard to acquire in most regions, and do 
not store long, there is an Aji Dulce Paste available on-line, made in 
Venezuela. Ing: Sweet Peppers, Onions, Beet, Garlic, salt, vegetable oil 
(soybean), vinegar, citric acid.

[Gentlemen's Pepper; Aji Picante (Puerto Rico) <i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>This Chili is unusual in having such a low hotness level for a 
<i>C. frutescens</i> Bird Pepper (Scoville 30,000 to 35,000 - most are 
Scoville 100,000 and up). In Puerto Rico, this is the preferred chili for 
the essential table condiment Pique. It is not always available even there, 
so chilis like the <a href="cp_caribz.html#jbird"><b>Jamaican Bird Pepper</b></a> are 
also used. Here in North America, we will use the ubiquitous 
<a href="cp_thaiy.html"><b>Thai Chili</b></a>, closer to the Jamaican in 
hotness.

<p>
This Chili is unusual in that it ripens point-up like other Bird Peppers, 
but is <i>C. annum</i> rather than <i>C. frutescens</i>. It is used in Jamaica 
where it first became popular, but is also used elsewhere in the Caribbean 
where hot chilis are enjoyed. It's heat level is <a href="cp_hottab.html#h9">
<b>H9</b></a>. The <i>C. frutescens</i> Bird Chilis are generally 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a> and produce for many years, while 
the Jamaican will produce for only one year. Bird Chilis of any kind are not 
much available in North America, so here everyone uses the ubiquitous 
<a href="cp_thaiy.html"><b>Thai Chili</b></a>, which is a Cayenne type, as 
is the Jamaican, and is similarly hot.

<p>
Not a Carribean Chili. Thai Chilis are the chilis universally used as "small 
fresh chili", green or red, by all the ethnic communities here in Southern 
California. It is also displacing Bird Chilis in other parts of the world due 
to being easier to grow and harvest, so it's probably grown in the Caribbean 
by now.</p>
<p>It is small, often less than 1-3/4 inches long as grown in Thailand, 
but there are many varieties and those grown in California are often up 
to 2-3/4 inches (more efficient to grow and harvest larger sizes). They 
are narrow, pointy and start growing point up, but turn downward as they 
reach full size. They turn from green to red when ripe (they may be 
somewhat orange in between). They are very hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">
<b>H8 to H9</b></a>), slightly less hot when red ripe, and a little less than 
that when dried. Fully red ripe prik ki nu dry very well. Those imported from 
Thailand tend to be hotter than if you dried those grown in California. 
Some minor varieties are black if in full sun, turning bright orange when 
ripe.

<p>
This chili is very much favored in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, 
and Venezuela, regions where hot chilis are not appreciated. It can surprise, 
though. While usually solidly within <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1">
<b>H1</b></a>,it can occasionally get to the high end of 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>. They are usually harvested while 
still yellow-green, but turn bright red if allowed to fully ripen. They have 
rather thin walls and thin skins, and grow to about 6 inches long. &nbsp;

<h2 id="haba">Habanero</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_habayr02h.jpg" alt="Whole Red amd Yellow Habanero Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
Originally from the Yucat&aacute;n of Mexico, These extremely hot chilis 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>) are one of the most 
important chilis in the Caribbean Islands, and are similarly important 
along the Caribbean coast. They come in Green, Red, Orange and Yellow, 
with White, Purple and "Chocolate" varieties known. Shape can vary 
radically. Those most commonly sold here in Southern California are 
wrinkly and bright orange. The name Habanero, "of Havana", comes from 
a time when they were shipped from that port. They are little used 
in Cuba today, as hot chilis are out of style there now.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Habanero, Orange</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_habanor03h.jpg" alt="Orange Habaneros, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
[<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>If you live in Southern California, this Orange Habanero is what you will 
be using. It totally dominates the market here, and other varieties are 
seldom seen. On the other hand, I haven't heard any complaints about that. 
Every market serving a Latino community has a bin of them, and Asian markets 
have at least foam trays of them. Apparently they are considered adequate for 
the job - high heat and good fruity flavor.
<br class=cll><p></p> 

<h2 id="scot">Scotch Bonnet</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_scotbon05e.jpg" alt="Yellow Scotch Bonnet Chilis, whole, cut" class=mrg>
  [Bonnie Pepper, Scotty Pepper; Ball-of-fire (Guyana); Aji Chombo 
  (Panama); <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This chili is often confused with the Habanero. To tell the difference, 
you apparently have to be Jamaican - so, just to be sure, I bought seeds 
certified as Scotch Bonnet by a Jamaican agricultural organization. 
These are yellow, but Scotch Bonnets also come in red. They are the 
same hotness (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>) as the Habanero, 
but with a somewhat sweeter and smokier flavor. My plant did nothing 
its first year, but was very productive in the second year.</p>
<p>In appearance, they are usually more rumpled than the Habanero. They 
got their name from a once common variety in Jamaica that was of a 
flattened rumpled disk shape, said to look like a Scottish bonnet. Today, 
due to the meddling of chili growers, they come in many shapes, colors 
and levels of hotness. This is the preferred chili for making jerk meat 
in Jamaica, as well as some hot sauces there, but are now grown all over 
the region. The largest in the photo was 1.7 inches long and 1.3 inches 
diameter.

<br><img src="img/cp_wiriwiri03h.jpg" alt="Dried Wiri Wiri Chilis" class=mrg>
[Guyana Pepper, Bird Pepper; <i>C. Frutescens</i>]
<p>This chili is very popular in Guyana, and used in a great many recipes there. 
It is near the low end (usually) of <a href="cp_hottab.html#h10">
<b>H10</b></a> and has a fruity flavor similar to the Scotch Bonnet. In 
Guyana it is usually used fresh, when ripe and bright red, but in most of 
North America we can get only dried. Fresh, they are about 1/2 inch diameter, 
and grow upright on their stems, as do other Bird Peppers. <u>Subst</u>: 
Scotch Bonnet or Habanero, both quite similar in hotness and taste, but 
different size and shape.
<br class=cll></p>




<h2 id="mj">Madame Jeanette</h2> 
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_madjean01h.jpg" alt="Whole Yellow Madame Jeanette Chilis" class=mrg>
[Suriname Pepper; <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This very hot chili (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>) is 
the most important chili in Suriname. Related to the Habanero, it is 
just about as hot, but more aromatic in cooking. The taste is said 
to have hints of pineapple and mango - but the main feature of this 
chili its full mouth hotness. They come in Yellow and Red, and vary 
greatly in shape, from long and curved to pumpkin shape, but always 
a bit wrinkled. It is thought it's name is that of a local prostitute 
(apparently very hot). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="adju">Adjuma</h2>

[Aji Umba, Dji Oema Ning (Suriname (lit. "Your name is woman")); 
<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This extremely hot chili (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10"><b>H10</b></a>), 
originally from Brazil, is almost as important as the Madame Jeanette 
in Suriname. It's size, shape and color are confusing, so it is often 
sold as Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, or even Madame Jeanette. It is less 
aromatic than Madame Jeanette. 
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="chilt">Chiltepin</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_tepin01h.jpg" alt="Whole Chiltepin Chilis" class=mrg>
[Chiltepe, Chili Tepin; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These tiny (up to about 0.35 inch dried) but intensely hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>) chilis possibly arose in 
Bolivia and southern Brazil, and were scattered throughout Central and South 
America and the Caribbean by birds long before humans invaded the Americas. 
They are found as far north Arizona and New Mexico and are still harvested 
wild (thus are quite expensive - 2022 U.S. $11.96 / ounce in 1/4 ounce 
bags). They are valued for their heat, complex flavor and medicinal uses. 
Their intense heat is sudden, but not long lasting, while that of the 
related <a href="cp_mexiz.html#pequ"><b>Pequin</b></a> builds more 
slowly but lasts longer.
