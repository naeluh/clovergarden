<span class=bg>China is not widely known as a land of Chilis</span>, and 
many regions are quite adverse to them, but their use is becoming more 
widespread due to the increasing popularity of the cuisines from the five 
most southern provinces: Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi.

<p>Like everywhere else, it was the Portuguese who brought hot chilis to 
China, to Zhejiang by 1671. They aren't recorded in Sichuan until 1749.
</p>

<p>The cuisines of Sichuan and Hunan are very distinctive, and have 
become quite popular outside the region, both in China and in the West. 
The cuisines of Yunnan, which borders Burma, Thailand, Laos, Sichuan, 
and Hunan are much less known. They are more similar to those of Southeast 
Asian, and vary with the many ethnicities that live there.</p>

<p>The cuisines of Guizou are also little known. They are mostly a 
patchwork of dishes adopted from the other southern regions, but also a 
lot from the Cantonese (Guangdong) to the east. The cuisines of 
Guangxi, which borders on Yunnan, Hunan, Guizou, Guangdong and Vietnam, 
are so little known, Wikipedia has only four rather non-specific lines 
with an error on one - and that could be the definition of "little known".

<h2 class=lrg id="var"><u>Chili Varieties - Fresh <small>&amp;</small> Dried</u></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Many more Chili varieties are grown in China, including many local 
varieties, but the ones listed here are predominant enough to be named 
export items.</p>

<h2 id="erjin">Erjingtiao Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_erjng02e.jpg" alt="Dried Erjingtiao Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Er Jing Tiao; Two Vitex; <i>C.annuum</i>]
<p>This is a unique chili, with a strong aroma and taste, but with very 
moderate heat, at about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>. It is 
used in many ways, dried and ground to flakes or powder, as an ingredient 
or as a dry dip.</p>
<p>This chili is so mild it is often eaten as a vegetable, green or 
red, as Anaheim chilis are here, seasoned with salt and soy sauce, or 
in recipes. In Sichuan, it also an essential ingredient in Chili Oil and 
various sauces. It is particularly essential in the famous 
<a href="sa_pdfavaz.html"><b>Broad Bean Chili Sauce</b></a> 
(La-Doubanjiang) of the region. These are up 7 inches long and 1 inch 
wide (178 x 25 mm).</p>
<p><u>Subst</u>: <a href="cp_mexiz.html#pasilla"><b>Chili Negro</b></a> 
is of similar size, shape, and almost the exact same heat, though a 
darker color. It is similarly aromatic, but noticeably sweeter. 
<a href="cp_indiz.html#byad"><b>Indian Byadagi</b></a> is of similar 
size and shape, and has almost exactly the same heat, but has a lighter 
less aromatic taste and much redder color.
<br class=cll><p></p>	

<h2 id="face">Facing Heaven Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_heaven01h.jpg" alt="Dried Facing Heaven Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Chao Tian Jiaom; <i>C.annuum</i>]
<p>These get their name from ripening point up. They are great chilis to 
use when you want a decorative scattering of chilis that aren't very hot, 
as in Sichuan Chicken or Kung Pao Chicken. They look fierce, but have low 
heat, about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a> - though a few 
can surprise. These are up to 2-3/4 inches long and 0.58 inch wide 
(70 x 15 mm). &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: &nbsp; The closest we have in North 
America is the Japones, but they are quite a bit hotter. For primarily 
decorative purposes, this should not be a problem.
<br class=cll><p></p>	

<h2 id="bull">Bullet Head Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bullet03h.jpg" alt="Dried Bullet Head Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Zi Dan Tou]
<p>This is a medium hot chili, often used by chefs as the whole chilis 
scattered in Mala Chicken or Kung Pao Chicken stir fry. It has good 
flavor and is moderately hot at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7">
<b>H7</b></a>. They are up to 2-3/4 inches long and 0.88 inch wide at 
the big end (70 x 22 mm). &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: While slightly different 
in shape and flavor, and just a little hotter, the common Japones are an 
acceptable substitute, especially for decorative applications. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="lant">Lantern Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_lant03e.jpg" alt="Dried Lantern Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Deng Long Jiao]
<p>A short, wide, intensely red chili of relatively moderate heat, about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a> at most. This chili is often 
used as a decorative item in Sichuan cuisines. The largest in the batch 
was 1.45 inches long, 1.31 inches diameter and nearly weightless. They 
were imported from Guizhou China.
<br class=cll><p></p>
	

<h2 id="rice">Rice Grain Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_stars02h.jpg" alt="Dried Star in the Sky Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Xiao mi la, Stars-in-the-Sky Chili (Man tian xing); <i>C frutescens</i>]
<p>These little guys are hot enough to make the Chinese see stars, but 
still not quite as hot as Thai Bird Chilis. They were used mostly in 
Yunnan province, which borders Burma, Thailand and Laos, but have now 
really caught on with Sichuan chefs, red, green and dried. Hotness is 
about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>, and they are up to 
1-3/4 inches long by 0.48 inch wide (45 x 12 mm). &nbsp; Subst: &nbsp; 
Thai chilis.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="jap">Japone Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japon05h.jpg" alt="Dried Japone Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Chinese Chili Pepper; Tien Tsin (China); Hontaka, Santaka, (Japan); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili originated in Jalisco, Mexico, but has become well known in 
South and Southeast Asia, and are grown very extensively in China, 
the second largest Chili exporter in the world (but less than half 
India's exports). They are easily identifiable by having no caps or 
stems. In North America, this is pretty much the default dried red 
chili, available everywhere. It has good flavor and is moderately hot 
at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h07"><b>H7</b></a>. They are 
up to 2-3/4 inches long and 0.63 inch wide (70 x 16 mm) and fairly 
plump. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sevstar">Seven Star Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_sevstar04h.jpg" alt="Dried Seven Star Chilis" class=mrg>
[Qixingjiao; <i>C frutescens</i>] 
<p>Another "heaven pointing chili", this is the hottest chili grown in 
Southern China, and the one official for chili eating contests there. 
They can be up to 2-1/2 inches long and 0.5 inch wide. Hotness is 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#09"><b>H9</b></a> (60,000 SU). These are 
interchangeable with Dried Red Thai Chilis from Thailand, and are 
hotter than what are sold as Thai Chilis here in North America.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="hunan">Pickled Red Chilis</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_pklthai02h.jpg" alt="Whole Pickled Red Asian Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>] 
<p>These pickled red chilis are important to the cuisine of Hunan, China and 
surrounding regions . They are best naturally salt fermented, but those 
aren't much available in North America. Ubiquitous in all Asian markets 
here in California is the Thai product shown in the photo. Apparently 
these are sufficiently acceptable to the cuisines that use pickled red 
peppers, it isn't urgent to have other types. These range from 2-1/4 to 
2-3/4 inches long and are moderately hot, around 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Thai Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_thai24h.jpg" alt="Rat Turd Chilis" class=mrg>
[Rat Turd Chili, Prik Ki Nu (Thai); Mak Pet Ki Nuu (Laos); Nga Yut Thee 
(Burma); Scuds (some chefs); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Currently (2020), Sichuan chefs have become enamored with the 
Xiao mi la (Rice Grain Chili) from Yunnan, fresh green and red, as 
well as dried. We do not have much access to these at this time in North 
America, but this variety of Thai Chili is very much available in all 
three stages, and will be of similar heat. It is small, often less than 
1-3/4 inches long as grown in Thailand, but those grown in California 
are often up to 2-3/4 inches. They are narrow, pointy and start growing 
point up, but turn downward as they reach full size. They turn from 
green to red when ripe, and may be orange in between. They are very hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8 to H9</b></a>), slightly less 
hot when red ripe, and a little less than that when dried.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Fresno Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is <u>not</u> a Chinese chili (at least not yet), but it has been 
chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as the medium hot fresh 
red chili suitable for their cuisines. Their hotness is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>. Core and seed them, but 
leave in the membranes (where the heat is) if you want heat. With the 
membranes carefully removed they have little heat. They have good 
flavor, and the walls are quite thick, so they are not dried. For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Serrano Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Serranos" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>These are <u>not</u> a Chinese chili (yet), but they are now quite 
popular in Thailand, and will probably spread. They are the go-to for 
fresh hot green chilis when chilis native to a particular cuisine are not 
available. They are found in all the Asian markets here in Los Angeles, 
as well as all other ethnic and non-ethnic markets.</p>
<p>These have more flavor than most hot green chilis - but nobody seems 
to be complaining.  They are fairly hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>), but the heat can be much reduced 
if necessary, by removing the seed mass and membranes. They are usually 
used with the seeds in. They can be up to 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) long and 
0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. The flesh is fairly thick, so they are not 
dried.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>

<h2>Bell Peppers:</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08h.jpg" alt="Fresh Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
[Tian Jiao (China); Shimla Mirch (India); Capsicum (British); Bell 
Peppers (North America); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
China is the largest grower and exporter of Bell Peppers in the world, 
and they have become quite important in Chinese cuisines, particularly 
in stir fries and for stuffing. In China, Red ones are the most used, 
but Green are also used. Box shaped to heart shaped, these are up to 5 
inches (12.7 cm) across here in California, but may be a bit smaller in 
some countries. They feature thick, crisp and flavorful flesh with no 
heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>), though occasionally one 
will be found to have a faint trace of heat. The walls are very thick 
with a high water content, so they are not dried except industrially 
for food processors.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>	     

<h2 class=lrg id="powd"><u>Chili Powders <small>&amp;</small> Flake</u></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Note that all these specimens were ground by me in my spice grinder, 
as commercial flake and powder were imperfectly available. That is how 
it would be done in Sichuan homes as well, though probably pounded in 
a mortar.</p>

<h2>Erjingtiao Chili Flake</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_erjngf02h.jpg" alt="Erjingtiao Chili Flake" class=mrg>  
<p>[Er Jing Tiao; Two Vitex; <i>C.annuum</i>]</p>
<p>This is a unique chili, with a strong aroma and taste, but with very 
moderate heat. It is dried and ground to flakes as an ingredient or as a 
rub or dry dip, for which it is particularly suited, with excellent 
flavor and distinct, but not overwhelming heat. 
<p><u>Subst</u>: <a href="cp_mexiz.html#pasilla"><b>Chili Negro</b></a> 
has almost the exact same heat, though is a darker color. It is similarly 
aromatic, but noticeably sweeter. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Facing Heaven Chili Flake</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_heavenf02h.jpg" alt="Facing Heaven Chilis Flake" class=mrg>  
<p>[Chao Tian Jiaom; <i>C.annuum</i>]</p>
<p>Flavor is a little lighter than the Erjingtiao chili, but it may be 
even less hot. 
<br class=cll></p>		

<h2>Bullet Head Chili Flake</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bulletf02h.jpg" alt="Bullet Head Chili Flake" class=mrg>  
<p>[Zi Dan Tou; <i>C.annuum</i>]</p>
<p>I have not seen this advertised in North America, but it is an 
excellent, flavorful, moderately hot flake, so I presume it is ground and 
used in Sichuan.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Stars-in-the-Sky Powder</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_starzf02h.jpg" alt="Star in the Sky Chili Powder" class=mrg>  
<p>[Xiao mi la, Man tian xing; <i>C frutescens</i>]</p>
<p>Here we are getting deep into Thai-hot territory. This is used mostly 
in Yunnan province, which borders Burma, Thailand and Laos. Extremely hot 
and lingering, about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>. 	
&nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: Ground dried red Thai Chilis are an excellent 
substitute. Cayenne would be significantly milder.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chili Powder</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japonf02h.jpg" alt="Japone Chili Powder" class=mrg>  
<p>[Chinese Chili Pepper; Tien Tsin (China); Hontaka, Santaka, (Japan); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>China exports vast quantities of Chili Powder marked just Chili Powder, 
without any indication of type. It is mostly from Japone type chilis or 
chilis of very similar heat and taste characteristics. The specimen to 
the left is Japone powder.
