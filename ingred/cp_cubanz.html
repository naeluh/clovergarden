<p>This Chili is said to have been brought from southern Italy in 1887, 
and is now very much favored in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic,  
and Cuba. They are called for in many recipes, but are not at all available 
here in Southern California, and in many other regions of North America, 
so substitutions must be made. Cubanelles are usually very mild, solidly 
within hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>, but they can 
occasionally get to the high end of <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2">
<b>H2</b></a>. They are usually harvested while still yellow-green, but turn 
bright red if allowed to ripen fully. They have rather thin skins and thin 
walls, and grow to about 6 inches long.

<h3>Substitutions:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California, we can use 
sweet Hungarian or Armenian / Turkish peppers when available. When they are 
not, I buy a bag of <a href="cp_minisz.html"><b>Mini Peppers</b></a> and 
use 3 to 4 times the number called for. This works quite well, but sometimes 
a little hot chili added with them is good, as they tend to be very mild. 
Otherwise half an Anaheim (thicker walls, a little more heat). Green bell 
pepper would be a very distant choice, (very thick walls, strong flavor and 
thick skins). For Anaheims or Bell Peppers I would blast the skins with my 
<a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush them off 
under running water.
