<h1>European  Chilis</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/caravel01e.jpg" alt="Portuguese Caravel" class=mrg>
<span class=bg>Both the Spanish and Portuguese brought Chilis back 
from the New World, but from different regions, and they used them quite 
differently.</span> The Spanish brought Chilis from Central America and 
Mexico, and set about developing mild chili varieties. The Portuguese 
brought Chilis from Brazil, where the hottest chilis had their origin. 
Portuguese sailors inflicted hot and super-hot chilis on nearly the 
entire world. The world loved them, and set about developing endless 
new varieties unique to their own cuisines.

<p>European Chilis are mostly derived from Spanish types, except in 
Portugal and Holland. Chilis were carried to Hungary by the Turks. 
These tended to be of moderate heat, as are Turkish chilis today, so 
they probably acquired them from the Spanish rather than the 
Portuguese. The Greeks probably got their chilis from the Turks, 
and the Italians from the Spanish. Spain continues to grow far more 
varieties of Chilis than the rest of Europe. The Dutch brought back 
fairly hot chilis from their East India colonies (Indonesia), who 
had gotten them from the Portuguese.</p>

particular cuisines, and available in North America. There are hundred, 
or even thousands more of local significance.</p>

<h2 id=bell>Bell Peppers</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08e.jpg" alt="Bell Peppers in various colors" class=mrg>
[Capsicum (British); Shimla mirch (India); Prik Pasom Sot (Thai); 
<i>C. annuum</i> var. <i>grossum</i>]
<p>
Green when unripe, red, yellow, orange, purple, white, pink, etc. when 
ripe. These are always sold fresh, and are only dried for use as 
industrial food additives. Box shaped to heart shaped, these large 
(up to 5 inches across) chilis feature thick, crisp and flavorful 
flesh with no heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>), making 
them popular in nearly every cuisine worldwide, including all 
European cuisines.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says the Bell Pepper originated in Szeged, Hungary in the 
1920s, and the USDA records the first commercial crop in the 
southeastern USA in 1925. On the other hand, Lionel Wafer wrote in 
1699, "Bell pepper is a large, fleshy mild green pepper, turning into 
red or gold when fully ripe". Further, Thomas Jefferson record receiving 
Bell Pepper seeds from Mexico in 1824, and the Boston Cooking School 
Cookbook of 1896 has a recipe for "Stuffed Peppers" calling for "6 
green peppers". Proportions given suggest Bell peppers. In these peppers, 
the gene for producing capsaicin is replaced by a recessive form, so they 
lack the sting of other chilis.

<br><img src="img/cp_stholland02e.jpg" alt="Four Striped Holland Peppers" class=mrg> 
<p>[Capsicum (British), <i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>This Bell Pepper was discovered in the Netherlands. It is now marketed in 
North America by Sunset as tropical "Aloha Pepper", even though it has 
nothing whatever to do with Hawaii or the tropics. Surprisingly, they taste 
just like Bell Peppers, and with heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">
<b>H0</b></a>). They can be eaten raw or cooked, and do retain their stripes 
when cooked.

<img src="img/cp_choriceros03h.jpg" alt="Dried Choricero Peppers" class=mrg>
[Guernika, Gernika, Cuerno de Cabra (Basque); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>This Chili is extremely popular in the Basque Country of the far north of 
Spain. Great festoons of them are hung up in Basque households to dry. 
They are very non-hot at <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H0-H1</b></a>. 
These peppers come in several shapes, some of which are narrow, very pointy 
and up to 8 inches long. The photo specimens are a variety where the point is 
tucked back into the inside. They were up to 5.5 inches long by 1-3/4 
inch diameter (14 x 4.5 cm).</p>
<p>Unlike the Espelette Pepper from the French side of the border, they dry 
very wrinkly, and are most often dried.  To use them they are soaked well, 
until the skins are fairly smooth.The flesh is then scraped from the skins, 
which can be done with a metal teaspoon. The taste is sweet, and with a hint 
of sun dried tomato. An essential use for these peppers is as a flavoring 
in Spanish Chroso sausages.

[Basque Pepper; Piment d'Espelette (France); Ezpeletako Biperra (Basque); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>This extremely popular Chili is grown in the the French Basque country, 
in towns tightly clustered in the far southwest corner of France, just 
above the Spanish border. Great festoons of them are hung up in Basque 
households to dry. They are smoky/fruity in flavor and moderately hot 
at <a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>. They are AOC (France) and PDO 
(Europe) protected in 10 towns. Due to the PDO (2002), they cannot be called 
"Espelette" if grown outside that tiny region. Some Non-PDO peppers are 
grown in California and Idaho. The photo specimens were up to 4 inches long 
and 1-1/8 inch diameter (10x3 cm), grown in Idaho and sold as "Basque Pepper".

<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is the chili chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as 
the medium hot fresh red chili suitable for their cuisines - and I 
have recently seen them listed in European chili lists, so make no 
apologies for including them here. They are about hotness 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>. Core and seed them, but 
leave in the membranes (where the heat is) if you want some heat. With 
the membranes carefully removed they have little heat. They have good 
flavor, and the walls are quite thick, so they are not dried. For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.

<h2>Guindilla (Basque)</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_guindill02e.jpg" alt="Long yellow Guindilla chilis" class=mrg>
While these pickled chilis from Spain superficially resemble Italian 
<a href="cp_euroz.html#pepero"><b>Peperoncini</b></a>, except for being much longer and 
thinner, the resemblance is just that, superficial. These have much 
better flavor and some nice, but not overwhelming, chili heat. Definitely 
superior, they are more appropriate as appetizers than as sandwich 
ingredients. The big one at the top was 6 inches long (not counting the 
stem) and 0.50 inch diameter at the big end.	Available from some purveyors 
of Spanish foods.

<h2 id="holland">Holland Red</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_holland08h.jpg" alt="Whole Holland Red Chilis" class=mrg>
[Dutch Red, Cabai Merah (Indonesia); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
A cayenne type pepper sold fresh and red ripe. They are 4 to 6 inches long 
by 5/8 inch diameter and tapered to a sharp point, hotness 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-H5</b></a>. They have thicker flesh 
than some long narrow chilis and sweet taste. These are popular in 
Holland and its former colonies in Indonesia as well as other parts of 
Europe and California. Probably would be about right for Sichuan and 
Hunan recipes and are a good choice for most ethnic cuisines. 
<a href="cp_euroz.html#fresno"><b>Fresnos</b></a> are a good substitute, though of 
different shape and thicker walled, and are much more readily available 
here in California.
<br class=cll></p>

<br><a href="cp_hungz.html">
<img src="img/cp_hunggr02h.jpg" alt="Whole Hungarian Green Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These yellow-green chilis have medium thick walls with crunchy texture 
and little or no heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0 - H1</b></a>). 
The center photo specimen was 5-7/8 inches long, 2-1/8 inches across and 
weighed 4-1/4 ounces.  Allowed to fully ripen they become bright 
red-orange.

<h2 id="hungw">Hungarian Wax</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_hungwx04h.jpg" alt="Whole Hungarian Wax Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These long, medium hot chilis, tapering to a slightly rounded tip, are 
sold fresh when yellow green. They have fairly thin walls and hotness is 
usually <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4,H5</b></a>. They are 
extensively used in European cuisines, particularly that of Hungary. 
Allowed to fully ripen, they become orange-red. The largest of the photo 
specimens was 7-3/4 inches long, 1.2 inches diameter at the big end and 
weighed 1-5/8 ounces.  
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="cuban">Italian Frying Pepper / Cubanelle</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_cuban01h.jpg" alt="Fresh green and red Cubanelle chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>This Chili is said to have been brought from southern Italy in 1887, 
and is now very much favored in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic 
and Cuba, but also used in many other cuisines where a thin walled, 
thin skinned very mild chili is wanted. Interestingly, I have never 
seen these in Southern California, where the type is represented by 
Hungarian and Armenian / Turkish peppers. These Chilis are usually 
very mild, solidly within hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1">
<b>H1</b></a>, but they can occasionally get to the high end of 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>. They are usually harvested 
while still yellow-green, but turn bright red if allowed to ripen. They 
have rather thin walls and grow to about 6 inches. &nbsp; 
<u>Subst</u>: preferably the very low heat Hungarian or Armenian / 
Turkish chilis. Anaheims are second choice (thicker walls, more intense 
flavor, usually a little hotter) and green bell peppers are a distant 
third (very thick walls, different flavor). &nbsp; <small>Photo

<h2 id="ital">Italian Sweet Peppers</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_italian08h.jpg" alt="Whole Italian Sweet Peppers" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Fresh green, 2 to 7 inches long by 3/4 inch in diameter, 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0-H2</b></a> 
and easily recognizable by their wrinkly tops. They come in two varieties, 
smooth and wrinkled. They are fine for munching on or using in salads or 
Italian recipes.  Red ones are sweeter but not nearly as available 
as green.<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="lomb">Lombardi</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_lombard02h.jpg" alt="Pickled Lombardi Pepper" class=mrg> 
[<i>C. annuum</i>]<p>
These Italian peppers are pickled in the same way as 
<a href="cp_euroz.html#pepero"><b>Peperoncini</b></a>, but have no heat whatever, making them 
comparatively rather dull and uninteresting. In my opinion, not worth 
the price. The longest in the photo was 7.5 inches long and 0.65 inch 
diameter. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="nora">Nora</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_nora01k.jpg" alt="Dried Nora Chilis" class=mrg>
[Choricero; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
A small heart shaped dried sweet pepper about 1-5/8 inch diameter or 
smaller. It's very important to much Spanish cooking, particularly from 
the Basque region. It's quite sweet with almost no hotness and can be 
had from Spanish emporiums in the U.S. at a stunning $3.50 per ounce or 
so. Cascabels look similar but have a thinner, much less sweet flavor 
and more hotness. </p>
<p>My formula for a substitute for Nora Peppers is this: 3 parts California 
Chilis, 2 parts Ancho Chilis and about 1/8 teaspoon of Lemon Juice for each 
chili used - Noras have a definite sour tang to them.  This mix is a shade 
darker in flavor and has a little more heat than real Noras but it's 
reasonably close.
<br class=cll></p>

<br><img src="img/cp_padron01e.jpg" alt="Fresh Green Padron Peppers" class=mrg>
[Pimientos de Padr&oacute;n (Spain); <i>C.annuum</i>]
<p>
From the concello of Padr&oacute;n  in the northwest corner of Spain, 
these peppers are wrinkly in shape and erratic in heat. The saying is, 
"Padr&oacute;n Peppers, some are hot, some are not". Those in the photo 
were grown in Southern California and were just a little hot. The largest 
was 2-3/4 inches long and 1-1/2 inches diameter. In weight they ran from 
about 1/2 ounce to 1-1/4 ounces. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: &nbsp; The 
Japanese <a href="cp_padshiz.html#shis"><b>Shishito Chili</b></a> is 
an  excellent substitute.

[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Medium size pointy pods of this sort (6 to 8 inches long and 1-1/2 inches 
wide) are allowed to ripen fully, then dried and ground into Paprika 
powder in Hungary (American paprika is made from dried Anaheim type pods). 
Originally all Hungarian paprika was hot, but non-hot versions were 
desired by neighboring countries. A mild variety was discovered, and now 
dominates production. The Hungarians say their Chilis came from China, 
but they were brought by invading Turks, who probably got them from 
the Portuguese through India, not China. In any case paprika chilis 
were being planted in private gardens in Hungary by 1569. &nbsp;

<h2 id="pepero">Peperoncini</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_pepron01h.jpg" alt="Whole Pickled Greek Chilis" class=mrg> 
[Peperoni, Friggitelli (Italy); Greek Peppers, Peperoncini (American 
English); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Pickled peperoncini are a mainstay of sandwich making and are often used 
in salads, particularly Greek salads. They are very seldom seen in North 
America except in pickled form, as in the photo. Greek varieties (the 
photo specimens were from Greece) are reputed to be sweeter than the 
Italian. They are picked fairly small, typically 2-1/2 inches long by 
1-1/4 inches across, and they are rather mild 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>). In Italy the name 
"peperoncini" is not used for these but only for hotter chilis.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="pimento">Pimento</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_pimento01.jpg" alt="Whole Red Pimento Peppers" class=mrg> 
[C. annuum]
<p>
Red ripe, round or heart shaped to 4 inches in diameter with thick walls 
making them substantial and attractive for food processing uses where 
appearance is a factor. Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">
<b>H0</b></a>, they are very tasty and sweet, similar in flavor to red 
bells but more intense. Unfortunately they are seldom seen in stores 
in the US.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=piquil>Pimientos del Piquillo</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_pequill01k.jpg" alt="Canned Piquillo peppers" class=mrg> 
<p>["Little Beak"; <i>C. annuum</i>]
</p><p>
Red ripe pimento type peppers grown around Lodosa in the Spanish state of 
Navarra and strictly regulated by <i>Denominacion de Origen</i>. They 
are flame roasted over open wood fires, seeded and peeled by hand and put 
up in jars and cans. Spanish chefs who otherwise would never consider 
something from a can to be edible dote over these. Similar peppers are 
grown and similarly prepared in Peru.</p>
<p>Piquillos are often stuffed and served as tapas. They have very low 
heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>) and are very tasty 
and sweet. Fresh they look like a Fresno chili, but lack the heat. As 
canned they measure about 2-1/2 inches long and 2-1/4 inches across. 
They can be ordered from Spanish import emporiums or from various 
on-line sources.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Piri Piri / Malagueta</h2>
<br><a href="cp_samz.html">
<img src="img/cp_piri03h.jpg" alt="Small Red Bird Chilis on plant" class=mrg></a>
[Piri Piri, Peri Peri, etc. (Portugal, Africa); <i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>
Up to 2 inches long, these are standard bird chilis. Larger ones are 
called Malagueta in Brazil and Portugal, smaller ones are called Piri Piri 
in Portugal and Malagueta in Brazil. They are pretty much identical to the 
Piri Piri chilis of Africa, because those were brought to Africa by the 
Portuguese. They are quite hot at 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). Subst: Thai Chilis, not as 
hot but much more available. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; many food 
writers have fallen afoul of confusion between Malagueta Peppers and 
Melegueta Pepper, a spice seed in the Ginger family also known as 
<a href="gg_gofpz.html"><b>Grains of Paradise</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Serrano Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Serranos" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Native to the mountains of Mexico, these are <u>NOT</u> a European 
chili, but they should be. They are available everywhere in the Americas, 
have been enthusiastically adopted in Thailand and are spreading to other 
parts of Asia. Here in North America, they are the "go-to" for fresh hot 
green chilis when chilis native to a particular cuisine are not 
available.</p>
<p>These have more flavor than most hot green chilis - but nobody seems 
to be complaining.  They are fairly hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>), but the heat can be much 
reduced if necessary, by removing the seed mass and membranes. They are 
usually used green with the seeds in. They can be up to 4.5 inches 
(11.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. The flesh is fairly thick, 
so they are not dried.

<h3>Cayenne</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_cayene01c.jpg" alt="Cayenne Chili Powder" class=mrg>
Even the Europeans can't get along without a touch of hot chilis. Fairly 
hot at around <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>, usually 
without much flavor, Cayenne is the "standard" for adding heat to recipes 
without greatly affecting the flavor. Sometimes it's made from actual 
Cayenne chilis but often not. It varies in color and is often of a duller 
and less red color than the version in the photo which was made by one of 
the big Mexican chili companies.

<h3>Paprika, Hungarian, Sweet & Hot</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_paprsw06c.jpg" alt="Hungarian Sweet Paprika Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Hungarian paprika is flavorful and brilliant red. "Sweet" 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>) and "Hot" 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>) versions are sold. Today, 
when a recipe calls for "paprika" it means sweet - hot is used mainly as 
a "sprinkle" at serving, but originally all Hungarian paprika was hot.</p>
<p>Though now the signature spice of Hungarian cooking, paprika was little 
used until after 1850. It is said the technique for grinding chilis into 
fine powder was first developed in Hungary.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Paprika, Spanish</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Piment&oacute;n]
<br><img src="img/cp_paprsps01c.jpg" alt="Spanish Paprika Powder" class=mrg>
<p>Spanish paprika is made from an entirely different chili than the 
Hungarian, coming directly from the New World rather than through Turkey, 
and it has a different flavor. It comes in several versions, including 
Dulce (Sweet), Agridulce (bittersweet) Picante (Hot, about 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>)), Ahumado (Smoked, about 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>)). Hungarian paprikas are 
reasonable substitutes for Dulce and Picante, but the others are unique 
to Spain.
