<p>
This is the chili sauce of Korea, one of the three essential ingredients 
in Korean cuisine (the other two are fermented bean paste and soy sauce). 
This is a fermented paste traditionally made from chilis, rice flour and 
soybeans. Today it may be made with wheat flour and grains in place of 
the rice flour, and most don't include soybeans. Processes and 
ingredients vary, resulting in prices at a local Korean market ranging 
from 2013 US $3.99 to $7.99 for a 1.1 pound tub. The photo specimen, 
made in Korea, is made from chili powder, rice, corn syrup, starch syrup, 
salt, alcohol, fructooligosaccharide. Another I have on hand is made 
from wheat flour, wheat grains, chili powder, salt, malt syrup, water.

<p>This paste started being made in Korea 18th century when chilis 
were brought to Korea, probably by Portuguese soldiers assisting 
China in a war with Japan. Today, Korean cuisine without chilis is 
unthinkable. It was originally made by adding chili and rice flour 
to fermenting soybean paste, but soybeans are not much used in this 
paste today. The method was to put it up in a big pottery jar and 
leave it out in the sun for months. Gochujang was made at home until 
around 1970 when commercial production began, and is seldom made at 
home today - well, perhaps in North Korea.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Any market serving a Korean community will 
have this essential paste, in various size tubs and jars. Not being 
Korean, I buy the smallest tubs, 1.1 pounds. I prefer the version 
made with rice flour.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This paste is used as an ingredient in 
soups, stews, marinades, dips, sauces and dressings. It contributes 
relatively little chili heat, so chili powder is often added to 
dishes as well.</p>
