<h1>Chili Heat <small>&amp;</small> Tolerance</h1>
<br><img src="img/cp_habard01h.jpg" alt="Hot Chilis" class=mrg>

<p>Lets make one thing clear right up front. The hotness of natural chilis 
can do you no real harm. The pain is fake - it's a nerve receptor thing 
and no actual damage is being done. Even the incendiary Red Habaneros in 
the photo will do no actual harm. Birds, lacking the nerve receptor found 
in mammals, detect no heat at all and feast on chilis.</p>

<p>Lets also be clear that recently developed chilis with hotness over 
1,000,000 scoville units, eaten alone, cause the body to do damage to 
itself. The nervous system is so convinced there is fire it will 
blister the mucous membranes to protect the flesh under them.</p>

<p>Persons little exposed to chili hotness will experience mostly pain, 
which will mask flavors and decrease enjoyment of the food the chilis are 
included in. Further, the following morning hapless neophytes will 
experience "afterburn", reminding them of previous suffering.</p>

<p>With frequent exposure to chili heat, the sensitivity of the nerve 
receptors decreases. A whole new realm of flavor and sensation opens 
up to those who have paid their dues. New digestive enzymes develop and 
"afterburn" is just a faded memory.</p>

<p>An excellent way to build up tolerance is to have your lunches at a 
Thai restaurant. Keep increasing the amount of the table condiments you 
use until you can order stuff "extra spicy" and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Considerable information, including heat scale and details of specific 
chili varieties will be found on our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Experience aside, even the most hardened chili hound must observe 
certain precautions. Chili heat can be intensely painful, even 
debilitating, but fortunately the pain goes away fairly quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>When working with chilis, take great care not to touch sensitive 
areas, particularly eyes and genitals (yours or anyone else's) until 
your hands have been thoroughly washed with soap or cleanser. The 
hotness is oil soluble, so just a water rinse won't do it.
<p></p></li>
<li>After working with the chilis, not only wash your hands, but also knives 
and other tools used, as well as the cutting surface, or you may be in for 
a surprise.
<p></p></li>
<li>The hotness of chilis varies tremendously. Always sample before going 
ahead with a recipe. The same type of chili bought from the same bin at 
the same store can be quite different than it was last week. Some chilis 
are deliberately atypical. Jalapenos with no heat have been developed so 
pseudo-Mexican restaurants in New York can advertise "real Jalapeno 
peppers" without devastating the populace.
<p></p></li>
<li>The hotness is not from the seeds nor the shell, but from oil droplets 
on the membranes the seeds are attached to. You can greatly reduce the 
hotness of a chili by carefully scraping out the membranes. Serranos, for 
instance, can easily be turned from fiery to blah this way, so don't just 
automatically scrape or you may be disappointed. Hotness is a major point 
of using chilis.
<p></p></li>
<li>To sample the hotness of a chili you can start munching from the tip, 
which will be very mild, and working up. Another method is to cut a very 
thin slice from just above the center of the chili and munch it. This 
test is definitive.
<p></p></li>
<li>When serving a mixed crowd, it's best to make the dishes rather mild, 
and provide hot condiments or sauces for the more experienced. Thai 
Chili Vinegar Sauce and other Southeast Asian dips and sauces are 
excellent for this.</li>
</ul>
