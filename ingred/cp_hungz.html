<p>
Many Hungarian and Romanian recipes published in English call for 
"Green Pepper". This pepper is what is meant, not green bell peppers 
which have much heavier walls and a different and much stronger flavor.</p>
<p>These peppers have very little or even no heat and are sold here in 
Southern California simply as "Hungarian Peppers". Hotter versions are 
also used in Hungary and Romania. Those are sold here as "Banana Peppers" 
or "Yellow Wax Peppers". The photo specimens, purchased at a large 
multi-ethnic produce market in Los Angeles. The big one at the top was 
9.8 inches long and 2.1 inches diameter. Chilis do not get hotter as 
they turn color.</p>

<p>These peppers, originating in the Americas, were brought to Hungary by 
the Turks a bit prior to CE 1550. They are used, often along with 
Tomatoes, "when in season". For the off season they are canned with 
tomatoes in a mix called Lecso. Of course, here in Southern California 
they are "in season" year round.</p>

<p>These peppers are erratically available year around in Southern 
California, but there are also suitable substitutes. Those sold as 
"Armenian" or "Turkish" peppers are very similar, though shorter in 
shape, much like the center one in the photo If nothing else is 
available, green Italian peppers can be used, but are very different 
in shape, which may make them unsuitable for some recipes. In the 
U.S. East, Cubanelles (Italian frying peppers) may be available.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Be aware! Naming practice may vary in different 
regions, so always check for hotness before using. Any hotness in the 
sweet Hungarians is up at the cap end and will be slight. Look for 
unblemished peppers with no soft spots. If your recipe doesn't depend 
on color those starting to turn orange will still work, though the 
flavor may be slightly sweeter and less sharp.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Don't overcook.</p>
