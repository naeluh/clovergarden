<p>
The Huy Fong "Rooster Sauce" products are made here in Los Angeles 
(Irwindale). David Tran, the founder of the company, now building a 
worldwide market that includes Southeast Asia, was forced out of 
Vietnam during "ethnic cleansing" after the war (Chinese ancestry). 
"Huy Fong" was the name of the ship he escaped to the United States 
on. He re-established the family business here, selling first to our 
huge Asian population - in large chunks of LA the signs are mostly 
in Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean.</p>

<p>Huy Fong sauces are made from red ripe Jalapeno peppers, because 
that's what the David Trang likes. Jalapenos didn't grow in Asia until 
these sauces came out, but you can bet they're being grown there now 
(Serranos are already big in Thailand due to influence from our Thai 
restaurants). Huy Fong is one of the great Los Angeles success stories. 
These sauces are so popular some Asian companies have imitated the Huy 
Fong's trade dress, and there have been lawsuits.</p>

<h3>Sriracha Sauce</h3> is a popular table sauce originating from the 
Thai resort town of Si Racha on the Bay of Bangkok. Moderately hot at 
about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a> it is now very popular worldwide. 
In North America it's a very popular ingredient in the famous 
Vietnamese 
<a href="../recipes/swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Mi Sandwiches</b></a>. 
It is gaining popularity in Vietnam, with Vietnamese visitors packing 
the stuff back in their luggage, but it is still considered a Thai sauce 
by many Vietnamese. Ing: chilis. sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, 
potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite, xanthan gum - about the same as 
Southeast Asian products.<p></p>

<h3>Chili Garlic Sauce</h3> is a standard sauce both as a recipe 
ingredient and as a table condiment in Thailand, Vietnam and southern 
China. At about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a> it's hotter than 
the Sriracha sauce. Ing: chilis, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, 
potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite, xanthan gum.<p></p>

<h3>Sambal Olec</h3> is a standard sauce in Indonesia and Malaysia, both 
as a recipe ingredient and as a table condiment.  At about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a> it's hotter than the Sriracha Sauce and 
just a shade hotter than the Chili Garlic Sauce (it's basically the same 
thing but without the garlic). Ing: chilis. salt, distilled vinegar, 
potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite, xanthan gum.</p>
