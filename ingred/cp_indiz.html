<h1>Indian Chilis</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_indiraj01.jpg" alt="Women Drying Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>
<p><b>Mirch</b> is the Hindi word for chili. Chilis were brought from 
South America to India by the Portuguese through their 
trading colony of Goa. India is now the largest producer and exporter of 
chilis in the world, growing a wide variety of different types, 
particularly in the south. The majority are left to ripen to red, and 
then sun dried. &nbsp; <small>Photo of chilis drying in 
Rajasthan, northern India &copy; 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0091</a>.</small></p>

<p>Indian chilis can be difficult to identify. Some sites say people in 
India only pay attention to "mild", "medium" and "hot", not named 
varieties. This is not precisely true - they know the mild, medium and 
hot chilis provided by their local merchants. These can be very specific 
types, but the merchants can be very inexact about names and origin.<p>

<p>This no longer works well. Indian communities are now scattered all 
over the world, and transportation of goods is fast and easy. Very 
accurate information should be made available as to exactly what kind 
of chili it is and exactly where it is from. This is not yet the case.
</p> 

<p>Since few identifiable varieties of Indian whole chilis are available 
in North America, even here Los Angeles, I have been able to take only 
a limited number of photos. Since I prefer not to "borrow" photos in 
violation of copyright, I have instead provided 
<a href="cp_indiz.html#links"><b>Links</b></a> to some Indian sites that do have 
photos.

<h2 class=lrg id="var"><u>Chili Varieties - Fresh <small>&amp;</small> Dried</u></h2>

<p>In India, chilis are generally used either fresh and green, or 
dried. Fresh red chilis are not so common in home cooking there.</p>

<h2 id="byad">Byadgi / Byadagi:</h2> &nbsp; varieties <b>Kaddi &amp; Dabbi</b>
<br><img src="img/cp_byada02h.jpg" alt="Dried Bedgi / Byadagi Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>
Dried Red. A long pointed chili, dark red and strongly wrinkled. The 
Dabbi variety is wider. Grown mainly in Karnataka, this chili has very 
little heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>, sometimes 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>). It is much used in Goa and 
Karnataka, states on the south west coast of India, and is considered 
essential to Marathi cuisine. It is particularly valued for the bright 
red color it imparts. It is often used in Goda Masala (for recipes that 
include chili, not all do).</p>
<p>This chili is also often ground and sold as "Kashmiri Chili Powder". 
It also supports a large oleoresin extraction industry. The red oleoresin 
is much used as a coloring in food and cosmetic products. The photo 
specimens, up to 7-1/2 inches (19 cm) long and 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) across, 
were purchased from a large Indian market in Los Angeles.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="curd">Curd Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_curd05h.jpg" alt="Dried Curd Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>
These are small green chilis soaked in yogurt or buttermilk and salt, 
then sun baked for nearly a week. Fry them in a little oil and serve as 
a condiment. They are used most on the west coast of India. Actually 
pretty tasty, hotness from <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a> to 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#05"><b>H5</b></a>, depending on what chilis were 
used. The photo specimens were Mullaku, about 1-7/8 inches long (48 mm), 
so quite hot. Dried green chilis, curd, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="dhani">Dhani</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_brdind02h.jpg" alt="Real Bird Chilis from India" class=mrg>
[Bird's Eye Chilis, Bird Chilis; C. frutescens]
<p>
These are real <a href="cp_mexiz.html#bird"><b>Bird's Eye 
Chilis</b></a> from India. They are small and intensely hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). Most ripen to deep red, 
but other colors may be seen. These ripen point up. They are hottest 
just before turning red, losing a little heat when red, and a little 
more when they are dried.</p>
<p>A number of varieties are available in India, used green, red, 
and dried. In North America only dried ones are available, and those 
rarely, but Indian expatriates here seem happy enough with the Thai 
Chilis grown in California. The largest in the batch the photo specimens 
were from was 1.35 inches (3.4 cm) long.
<br class=cll></p> 

<h2 id="thai">Dhani - Thai Chilis</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_thai24h.jpg" alt="Red, Green and Dried Thai Chilis" class=mrg>
[Bird's Eye Chilis, Bird Chilis; C. annuum]
<p>
These Chilis are becoming the most common hot chilis all over the world, 
because they're easier to grow and harvest than real Bird's Eye Chilis. 
They aren't as hot, and have a different flavor, but are suitable for 
most recipes. Those grown in Tailand are about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>, but those grown in North 
America tend to be more like <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>. 
Most ripen to deep red, but the ones I grow ripen to bright orange. 
Unripe they are green, but if expose to full sun, some are black on the 
sun side. They are hottest just before turning red, The photo shows fresh 
green and red Thai Chilis grown in California, 
and dried red ones from Thailand. The largest was 2.63 inches (6.7 cm) 
long (not counting stem) and 0.4 inch (1.0 cm) diameter.

<h2>Fresno Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is <u>not</u> an Indian chili (at least not yet), but it has been 
chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as the medium hot fresh 
red chili suitable for their cuisines. Their hotness is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>. Core and seed them, but 
leave in the membranes (where the heat is) if you want heat. With the 
membranes carefully removed they are pretty low heat. They have good 
flavor, and the walls are quite thick, so they are not dried. For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Goan</h2>
<br>Dried. A large conical chili (similar in shape to our Fresnos) used 
in Goa, where the Portuguese introduced chilis to India. It is only 
moderately hot, and when not available one or another variety of 
"Kashmir" chili is used.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2 id=mund>Ramnad Mundu / Gundu Molzuka / Round:</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ramn03h.jpg" alt="Dried Ramnad Mundu Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>Dried. A small almost spherical chili with shiny skin, an orange-red 
color and medium heat. It is grown particularly in the Ramnad district 
of southern Tamil Nadu, and is used in that state, particularly in 
the Chettinad cuisine. The photo specimens, purchased from a large 
Indian market in Los Angeles, seemed to vary from around 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a> to 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>. They ranged from 0.7 to 
1.25 inches diameter, with most around 1.0 inch (2.5 cm).
<br class=cll><p>


<h2 id="gunt">Guntur Red</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_guntur01h.jpg" alt="Dried Guntur Red Peppers" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annum</i> mostly var <i>longhum</i>]
<p>This is a non-specific term. Guntur, near the central coast of 
Andhra in southern India (just north of Tamil Nadu on the east coast of 
India) is a center for chili production, and the source of most exports 
from India. &nbsp; <b>Notice:</b> &nbsp; <u>Guntur Chilis are illegal to 
import into the United States or the European Union due to excessive 
levels of pesticide residue</u>. &nbsp; <small>Photo copyright unknown 
- widely used by Indian exporters</small>.</p>
<p>Many varieties are grown in Guntur, Here are a few examples:
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Guntur Sannam S4:</b> &nbsp; This is the major variety. It is 
  usually around 5 inches (12.5 cm) long, narrow and hot (Scoville 35,000 
  to 40,000, our <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>). About 
  280,000 metric tons per year are produced.</li>
<li><b>Wonder Hot:</b> &nbsp; The hottest Guntur chili, (our 
  <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8 - H9</b></a>).</li>
<li><b>334:</b> &nbsp; A premium export chili.</li>
<li><b>Teja</b> and <b>Phatki:</b> &nbsp; Rather hot varieties.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="ind">"Indian Chili"</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_indialg01h.jpg" alt="Long Green Indian Chili" class=mrg>
This is the fresh green chili produce markets in Los Angeles have been 
selling as "Indian Chili". I don't know if such chilis are actually 
grown in India - I haven't seen Indian references to long green chilis 
that are as mild as these (about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3">
<b>H3</b></a>). They are up to 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) long, and most are 
just shy of 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter. 
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2 id="indh">Indian Hot Green Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_india21e.jpg" alt="Hot Green Indian Chili" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>These started appearing in a Los Angeles produce market in January 2017, 
in place of the green chilis pictured above. They are a much more 
satisfactory Indian Chili, being quite hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>). They have the thick taper at 
the cap end and the more wrinkly appearance I see in photos of Jawala 
chilis in India. The photo specimens were about 4-1/8 inches long and 
0.38 inch diameter (10.5 x 1.0 cm).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Japone</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japon05h.jpg" alt="Dried Japone Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Hontaka, Santaka, Chinese chile pepper; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili originated in Jalisco, Mexico, but has become well known in 
South and Southeast Asia, and China. Indian markets here in 
Southern California all have big bags of them, easily identifiable by 
having no caps or stems. In North America, it's pretty much the default 
dried red chili, available everywhere. It has good flavor and is 
moderately hot at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="jawa">Jwala</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_jawala01h.jpg" alt="Long Green Volcano Peppers" class=mrg>
[Hot Finger Chili; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
 Fresh Green, but sometimes used dried red. This is the 
most popular hot green chili in India. They are long (about 5-1/2 
inches  (14 cm)), very narrow, a little wrinkled, and quite hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>) - the name means "volcano" 
in Hindi. It is grown mainly in Gujarat (situated on the northwest coast 
of India). Subst: Serrano (hot end of range) or green de Arbol.

<br><img src="img/cp_kanthari01h.jpg" alt="Indian Kanthar Bird Chilis on Bush" class=mrg>
<p>[Bird Chili, Bird's Eye Chili; 
<i>C. frutescens</i>]</p>
<p>This Bird Chili is grown in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the far south 
of India. One variety has white pods until they ripen through yellow 
to bright orange red. Other varieties are green until they ripen to 
bright red. It is conical, small, 1.0 x 0.25 inch (2.5 x 0.6 cm) and 
very hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). I have found 
these sold as "Moru Mulaku Vadagom" or Dried Green Curd Chilis (see 
Curd Chilis, above).

<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="kash">Kashmiri, True</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_kashmir02e.jpg" alt="Dried Kasmir chilis" class=mrg>
Dried. A very flavorful intensely red chili grown in Kashmir. It is a largish 
chili with medium conical shape, a fruity flavor, and little heat. Dried it 
is fairly smooth and very dark in color. Kashmir chilis are not much exported 
from the region due to scarcity.<p></p>

<h3>Kashmiri:</h3> &nbsp; Since real Kashmir chilis are in 
very short supply in India, and demand for this type of chili is very 
high, substitutes are far more common than the real thing. Most chilis 
used to make "Kashmir" chili powder are a more elongated type, often 
<a href="cp_indiz.html#byad"><b>Byadagi</b></a> varieties Kaddi or Dabbi, but still 
very mild. They are not so intensely red, so  a little paprika is often 
added to a dish for color. Subst: Indian chefs abroad recommend a mix 
of mostly paprika with some cayenne for heat, but Kashmiri chili powder 
(the substitute kind) is easily available from Indian markets here in 
Los Angeles. <b>Aleppo Extra Hot</b>, fairly easy to find in North America, 
is an excellent and suitably flavorful substitute.

<p> 
This chili is grown in the far northeast of India, mainly the states 
of Nagaland, Assam and Manipur. It was famous for a while as the hottest 
chili known (2007), at about Scoville 1,041,427 (varies widely depending 
on where it is grown). It was displaced in 2012 by the "Trinidad Moruga 
Scorpion" at about Scoville 1,200,000, which was itself displaced in 
2013 by the "Carolina Reaper" from U.S. South Carolina at over Scoville 
2,200,000. While commonly red, it is also grown in white, yellow and 
purple varieties, and shape can also vary somewhat.

<h2 id=punjp>Punjab Puya</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_punjab01h.jpg" alt="Fresh Red Punjab Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Usually dried. A popular chili in northern India, which will grow in 
a wide variety of climates. It is about 4 inches (10 cm) long, 1/2 inch 
(1.3 cm) diameter, bright red and wrinkled. Very hot at about

<h2 id=resh>Reshampatti</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_resham11h.jpg" alt="Dried Reshampatti Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Dried. A short, broad conical chili of a maroon color and medium heat 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>). It is very popular in 
Gujarat on the west coast, but is a fine chili for the cuisines of most 
of India. In Gujarat and Maharshtrian it is used to spice pickles. I 
have yet to see whole dried Reshampatti chilis here in Southern 
California, but fine flake is easily available in Indian markets here. 
It is deep red and quite flavorful. The photo specimens, purchased from 
a vendor in India, were typical. The largest was 2-7/8 inches (7.3 cm) 
long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide.</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about this chili. Some Internet sites 
show it as a long, thin, very hot chili, but the Indian sources from 
which I have bought reshampatti chilis, have them as wide and medium 
hot.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Serrano</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Serranos" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Fresh Green. NOT an Indian Chili (yet), but now popular in Thailand. 
They are commonly used in place of Jawalas here in North America. All 
the Indian markets here carry them (but so does just about every other 
market). They have more flavor than most hot green chilis - but nobody 
seems to be complaining.  They are fairly hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>) and can be up to 4.5 inches 
(11.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. 
<br class=cll></p>		     


<h2>Shimla Mirch:</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08h.jpg" alt="Fresh Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
[Capsicum (British); Bell Peppers (North America); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is the Bell Pepper available everywhere in North America. 
They are always available fresh and are only dried for use by industrial 
food processors. Box shaped to heart shaped, these are up to 5 inches 
(12.7 cm) across here in California, but may be a bit smaller in India. 
They feature thick, crisp and flavorful flesh with no heat 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>), though occasionally one 
will be found to have a faint trace of heat. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Tomato Chili / Warangal Chappatta:</h2> 
<br>Dried. A wide conical chili with a blunt end (similar in shape to 
our Fresno chili, but with a blunt tip and thinner flesh) grown in 
Andhra in southeast India. They are fairly mild.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2 id="vath">Dried Vathals</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_vatha02h.jpg" alt="Dried Vathals" class=mrg>
"Vathals" are vegetables, dried with a coating of salt or curd and 
salt. these chilis claimed only "Chilis, Salt", but the taste suggested
curd was also used. They were about 4-1/2 inches long (114 mm) and quite 
hot. The instructions were "Dip fry and serve hot". 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Yellow</h2>
<br>Dried. A yellow chili favored by gourmets in northern India for their 
white and yellow curries. It is grown mainly in Punjab in northern India, 
just south of Kashmir.<p></p>

<p><br></p>


<h2 class=lrg id="powd"><u>Chili Powders <small>&amp;</small> Flake</u></h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id="alep">Aleppo</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [pul biber (Turkey (flake pepper)); <i>Capsicum annuum</i>]
<br><img src="img/cp_alepexh01c.jpg" alt="Aleppo Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>This is <u>NOT</u> an Indian Chili Powder, but Aleppo Extra Hot makes an 
excellent substitute for Indian <a href="cp_indiz.html#kash"><b>Kashmir</b></a> powder, 
which is much harder to find in North America. Aleppo Mild 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>) is less hot than Kashmir, and 
Aleppo Extra Hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H2</b> to <b>H3</b></a>) 
may be slightly hotter. Both are very flavorful.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="kash">Kashmir</h3> - [Kashmiri Mirch (India)]
<br><img src="img/cp_kashp07c.jpg" alt="Kashmir Chili Powder" class=mrg> 
<p>Hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>. Kashmir chili powder 
is widely used in Indian cooking, particularly in the relatively softly spiced 
meat dishes of the north. It is rarely made from actual Kashmiri chilis, which 
are in very short supply, but from other mild, intensely red chilis, 
particularly Byadgi / Byadagi. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: <a href="cp_indiz.html#alep">
<b>Aleppo Extra Hot</b></a> makes an excellent substitute for Kashmir and is 
more available in North America. Aleppo Mild is a little too mild and a lot 
sweeter, but some may prefer it, or add a dash of hotter chili. Expatriate 
cooks from India often recommend real <a href="cp_indiz.html#paph"><b>Hungarian Sweet 
Paprika</b></a> with a dash of Cayenne for hotness.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="paprik">Paprika, Sweet</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_paprsw06c.jpg" alt="Sweet Paprika Powder" class=mrg>
Paprika is much used in Indian cuisine to provide a bright red color 
without making the dish too hot, particularly because true Kashmir chilis 
are not available. The best to use is genuine Hungarian paprika, which is 
sweet (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">H0</a>), flavorful, brilliant red, 
and far superior in taste to American paprika. which is usually ground 
from New Mexico chilis. Many expatriate Indian cooks use Paprika with a 
dash of Cayenne or other hot pepper to replace Kashmir powder.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="khand">Khandela</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Medium Hot]
<br><img src="img/cp_khandela02c.jpg" alt="Fine Khandela Flake" class=mrg>
<p>
This chili powder, actually usually a fine flake, is a bit less sweet 
and a bit hotter (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">H4</a>) than Kashmir, 
and a good choice for all-around Indian cooking where you don't want 
too mild or too hot.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="reshamp">Reshampatti</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Resham Patti] 
<br><img src="img/cp_resham06c.jpg" alt="Fine Reshampatti Flake" class=mrg>
<p>
Though whole reshampatti chilis are not much seen in North America, the 
ground version is very common in Indian markets here. This chili powder, 
often a fine flake, is a less sweet, significantly hotter 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">H4</a>) and less red than Kashmir, and 
a good choice for all-around Indian cooking.</p>
<p>There is confusion about this name. Some sites and vendors list 
reshampatti as "very hot" and show long thin red chilis. The photo 
specimen I ground myself from the wide reshampatti chilis I purchased 
directly from India, so I know exactly what it is.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="extra">India Extra Hot</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_indext06c.jpg" alt="India Extra Hot Powder" class=mrg>
This is the hottest, up to <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">H8</a>, of the 
chili powders sold in the Indian markets here in Southern California. It 
is likely ground from <a href="cp_indiz.html#gunt">Guntur Chilis</a> and is about as 
hot as Cayenne, but with better flavor than most cayennes. Use it for 
the cuisines of southern India and on the west coast from Goa on south, 
or wherever Cayenne is called for.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="white">White Chili Powder</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_whitepwd01c.jpg" alt="White Chili Powder" class=mrg>
<p>
This ground chili powder is used a fair amount in India to spice up 
recipes with white sauces (all white feasts were popular with the ruling 
class during the Moghul empire period). I'm not sure how it's made but 
it's an extremely fine powder and about as hot as Reshampatti (
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">H4</a>), but it lacks the distinctive 
flavor of red chili peppers. Consider it a "hottening agent" only, but 
much safer to use than capsaicin extracts.
