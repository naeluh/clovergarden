<h1>Jalape&ntilde;o, Chipotle &amp; Morita Chilis</h1>

<p>[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]</p>
<p>Jalape&ntilde;o type chilis, fresh green, red, pickled, and smoked, 
are very important to all the cuisines of Mexico, as well as TexMex 
cuisine north of the border. and have started invading other cuisines. 
The Jalape&ntilde;o is the state chili of Texas.</p> 
<p>Because of their unique flavor and thick flesh, Jalape&ntilde;os are 
not "plug compatible" with other green chilis in recipes. Genetic 
analysis shows Jalape&ntilde;os to be a distinct clade within 
<i>Capsicum annum</i>, with no close relatives outside the clade. There 
are many cultivars of Jalape&ntilde;os, differing in size, hotness, 
and ideal growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Jalape&ntilde;o Chilis, Fresh</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_jalap07d.jpg" alt="Green and Red Jalap&ntilde;o Chilis, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
[Cuaresme&ntilde;os, Chile Gordo (green, Mexico); Huachinango (red, 
Mexico); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>These are usually sold in the fresh green state. Their flesh is quite 
thick, so they don't dry well at all. They are usually 2 to 3 inches by 1 
inch diameter, with blunt tip, hottness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h5">
<b>H5-H6</b></a>. 
The skin is dark green (or red), smooth and shiny but often has faint 
stretch marks (corking). Due to growing conditions, specimens with 
corking tend to be considerably hotter than those without. With its 
thick flesh and distinctive flavor, the Jalape&ntilde;o is the preferred 
chili for many Mexican salsas and for hot pickled peppers. 
<p>Red ripe Jalape&ntilde;os are very rare, even in Southern California, 
probably because Huy Fong Foods buys them all up to make their famous (though not 
precisely authentic) Sriracha sauce. They don't have Jalape&ntilde;os in 
Vietnam (yet) but the owner of Huy Fong loves them.</p>
<p>Plant breeders have recently developed special "low heat" and "no 
heat" varieties of Jalapeno so "Mexican" restaurants in New York can 
advertise "real Jalapeno peppers" without devastating the population. 
Fortunately, if we grow any of those here, we export them all.

<h2>Jalape&ntilde;o Chilis, Pickled</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_jalapp02h.jpg" alt="Pickled Jalape&ntilde;o Chilis, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
[Jalape&ntilde;os en Escabeche]
<p>These are a very popular condiment and/or snack in Mexico. They are often 
pickled with slices of Carrot included. Ing: Jalape&ntilde;o peppers, 
Water, Vinegar, Carrots, Onions, Salt, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Calcium 
chloride, Spices.

<h2>Chipotle Chilis, Morita Chilis</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_chipot06h.jpg" alt="Whole Chipotle Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>These are Jalape&ntilde;o Chilis that have been smoked. Because their 
thick walls make them unsuitable for sun drying, this method of preserving 
them was developed thousands of years ago. Chipotles will generally 
be somewhat less hot than the Jalape&ntilde;os, so figure around 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-H5</b></a>.</p>

<p>The common versions are pictured from left to right:
<br> &curren; &nbsp; <b>Brown Chipotle:</b> &nbsp; [Chipotle Meco, 
  Tipico] &nbsp; The most common kind in Mexico, but not so common north 
  of the border. It is a ripe jalapeno, dried and intensively smoked, 
  properly over a smoldering pile of jalapeno foliage.
<br> &curren; &nbsp; <b>Chipotle in Adobo Sauce:</b> &nbsp; The most 
  common version in the U.S., these are actually Chili Morita, a small 
  variety of red ripe jalape&ntilde;os. They are smoked less intensively, 
  so they still have a fruity flavor and some color. Smothered in red 
  Adobo Sauce, they are put up in 7 oz cans. The sauce has been wiped 
  from the photo specimen. Chipotles with Adobo Sauce, with their smoky 
  flavor, are absolutely wonderful with scrambled eggs and in other 
  egg dishes.
<br> &curren; &nbsp; <b>Chili Morita:</b> &nbsp; A red ripe 
  jalape&ntilde;o of a smaller variety, smoked (less intensively than 
  Chipotle Meco) and dried. Since they are much smaller, they are often 
  mistakenly called "smoked serrano". Serranos would be much hotter.
