<i>Capsicum baccatum</i>]
<p>
This Chili originated in South America, but is best known from South Africa. 
Plants were found on a property formerly owned by a botanist, and were 
quickly put to use as pickled peppers. they are fairly thick walled and of 
rather moderate heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>)
</p>

<p>These chilis are not commercially available in North America, except in 
their pickled form from South Africa. To have them fresh, you must grow 
them yourself from seed. Fortunately, they grow enthusiastically in part 
shade and are good producers. They are perennials, so will produce for quite 
a few years if protected from frost. The largest in the photo was 1.45 
inches long x 1.22 inches diameter.</p>

<h3>Peppadew&reg; Pepper</h3> &nbsp; This is the form in which most people 
know the Juanita Chili. They are cored to reduce hotness 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>), and pickled with quite 
a bit of sugar added. These peppers are often stuffed as an appetizer, or used 
as a garnish, whole or sliced. The largest in the photo was 1-1/2 inches 
diameter by 0.9 inch high. Most were closer to 1 inch diameter. Weight (cored 
and pickled) averages about 0.33 ounce each (9.4 gms). Actual flavor is very 
similar to pickled Red Bell Pepper. Ing: juanita peppers, water, sugar, 
vinegar, salt, citric acid, ascorbic acid, calcium chloride.

<p>Seeds of Juanita Peppers are available under several names, but growers 
on contract to Peppadew International must buy young seedlings of a patented 
cultivar directly from Peppadew. They must grow them as annuals to assure 
uniformity.</p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The pickled Peppadew&reg; Peppers are easily 
available on-line in North America, and in a few markets. The photo 
specimens were purchased on-line for 2021 US $11.42 for a 14 ounce jar, 
containing about 20 peppers.
