<br><img src="img/cp_kabuk01k.jpg" alt="Kabuki Chili Deamon" class=mrg>
<p><span class=bg>Chilis came were adopted rather late in Korea, and are 
still a minor item in Japan</span>. Chilis are thought to have been 
brought to Korea by Portuguese mercinaries sent by the Ming Chinese 
to help fighting the Japanese in Korea during the Imjin War (ended 
1598). The Koreans had a taste for hot spices and began using them, 
but it was 200 years later that they started using them in Kimchee, 
and found they acted as a preservative, allowing less expensive salt 
to be used.

[Fushimiama (mild), Fushimikara (medium hot); <i>C.annuum</i>]	
<p>These long narrow pointed chilis are a traditional variety in 
Japan. They have a smooth, glossy skin, and grow to about 6 inches long. 
They are highly variable in heat, depending on variety. Then can be 
very mild, <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a> to medium hot 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>. They can be used raw or 
cooked, in salads, stir fries, ohitashi, tempura and yakitori. They 
are also saut&eacute;ed and eaten with sea salt same as

slightly blunt point, hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2">
<b>H2-H4</b></a>. These are found in Koran markets and in and some 
multi-ethnic produce markets. They vary rather widely in hotness. Most 
have very moderate heat, but I recently bought some red ones that were 
about as hot as <a href="cp_mexiz.html#holland"><b>Holland Reds</b></a>.

<h2 id="cuke">Cucumber Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_cuke03h.jpg" alt="Fresh Red Cucumber Chilis" class=mrg>  
[oi-gochu, asagi-gochu (Korea); <i>C.annuum</i>]
<p>This is a very mild Chili now popular in Korea, green but also red. There 
is no official designation, so growers use these names for any variety that 
meets the flavor and hotness profile. They are generally eaten fresh 
green as crudit&eacute;s with dip, or in salads, but those I've found here 
in Los Angeles are red. Taste is similar to Red Anaheim.</p>
<p>The largest in the specimen batch was 4.9 inches long, not including the 
stem, and 0.83 inches diameter at the big end (124 x 21 mm), weighing about 
41 to the pound (0.4 oz / 9.6 gm each). They have definite sharpness up at 
the stem end, so heat is about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a> 
for the stem end quarter. The photo specimens were purchased from a Korean 
Market in Los Angeles (La Ca&ntilde;ada). They are still quite rare (12-2020), so 
sold at a high price, 2020 US $12.99 / pound.

[<i>C.annuum</i>]	
<p>These long "string chilis" are quite mild if picked young at about 4 
inches. More mature they get tough skins and higher heat. They can 
be used raw or cooked, in salads, ohitashi, tempura and yakitori. They 
are also saut&eacute;ed and eaten with sea salt same as

<h2 id="jap">Japone Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japon05h.jpg" alt="Dried Japone Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Hontaka, Santaka, Yatsufusa (Japan); Chinese Chili; Tien Tsin (China); 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; similar but may be a little hotter, Takanotsume 
(Hawk Beak); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili originated in Jalisco, Mexico, but has become well known in 
South and Southeast Asia, and are grown very extensively in China, 
the second largest Chili exporter in the world (but less than half 
India's exports). They are easily identifiable by having no caps or 
stems. In North America, this is pretty much the default dried red 
chili, available everywhere. It has good flavor and is moderately hot 
at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>. They are 
up to 2-3/4 inches long and 0.63 inch wide (70 x 16 mm) and fairly 
plump.

<img src="img/cp_jap14e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Japanese Shishito Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[Ggwari-gochu (Korea); Japanese Chile; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Used raw or cooked by several methods in both Korea and Japan. 
These are now grown in California and widely available here, both for 
themselves, and as a substitute for Spanish Padr&oacute;nes and 
Philippine Sili Mahaba.  Fresh dark green (red ones are very rare), 
these chilis have unique lengthwise ridges and blunt ends. They 
have good flavor are generally very mild at <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">
<b>H0</b></a>, but about 1 in 20 can surprise, cranking it up into the 
high <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a> range.  They are usually 
3-1/4 inches long and 1/2 inch diameter, but can be a bit larger. In 
Japan and Korea, they are most often saut&eacute;ed in hot oil and 
eaten with sea salt.

<h2>Fresno Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is <u>not</u> a Korean / Japanese chili (at least not yet), but it has 
been chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as the medium hot fresh 
red chili suitable for their cuisines. Their hotness is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>. Core and seed them, but 
leave in the membranes (where the heat is) if you want heat. With the 
membranes carefully removed they have little heat. They have good 
flavor, and the walls are quite thick, so they are not dried. For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Serrano Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Serranos" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>These are <u>not</u> a Korean / Japanese chili (yet), but they are 
now quite popular in Thailand, In North America, they are the go-to for 
fresh hot green chilis when chilis native to a particular cuisine are not 
available. These have more flavor than most hot green chilis - but nobody 
seems to be complaining.</p>
<p>Serranos are fairly hot (about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6">
<b>H6</b></a>), but the heat can be greatly reduced if necessary, by 
removing the seed mass and membranes. They can be up to 4.5 inches 
(11.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. The flesh is fairly thick, 
so they are not dried.

<h2>Bell Peppers / Piman</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08h.jpg" alt="Fresh Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
[Piman (Japan); Tian Jiao (China); Shimla Mirch (India); Capsicum 
(British); Bell Peppers (North America); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These are used throughout Asia, with China the largest grower and 
exporter in the world, and they have become quite important in almost 
all cuisines. Box shaped to heart shaped, these are up to 5 inches 
(12.7 cm) across here in California, but may be a bit smaller in some 
countries. They feature thick, crisp and flavorful flesh with no 
heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>).  The Japanese Piman 
is a bit smaller and has thinner walls than the North American variety. 
The walls are very thick with a high water content, so they are not 
dried except industrially for food processors.

<h2 class=lrg id="powd"><u>Chili Powders <small>&amp;</small> Flake</u></h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Korean - Flake and Powder</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_korea05h.jpg" alt="Koran Flake and Powder" class=mrg>
<p>[Gochu-garu (flake); Gochujang-yong-gochu-garu (powder)]</p>
<p>Hotness of the flake varies, but is usually between 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b> and <b>H3</b></a>, sweet and tasty to 
moderately hot.  Whether it's hot or mild will be written in Korean - see 
below, noticing that the first character is different for Mild. If there is 
any English it will probably just say "Chili Powder" for powder and flake. 
The powder tends to be quite a bit more variable than flake, and can be as 
low as <a href="cp_korjz.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a> and as high as <a href="cp_korjz.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>. 
In general, for powder, the brighter the red color the milder it will be, 
but that's not totally reliable. Both flake and powder are used liberally 
in kimchi and other Korean dishes, so turnover at Korean markets is quick 
and the product is generally of excellent quality.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/cp_garu01s.jpg" alt="Korean Chili Flake and Powder" class=mrg>
&nbsp; Chili Flake and Powder = Gochu-garu
<br class=cll><img src="img/cp_mild01s.jpg" alt="Korean Mild Chili Flake" class=mrg>
&nbsp; Mild Flake = Deol-maewoon gochu-garu
<br class=cll><img src="img/cp_hot01s.jpg" alt="Korean Hot Chili Flake" class=mrg>
&nbsp; Hot Flake = Mae-woon gochu-garu

<h2>Korean Chili Threads</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_thread02c.jpg" alt="Red Chili Threads" class=mrg>
<p>[Silgochu (Korea)]</p>
<p>These threads are used as a garnish for some Korean dishes. They are 
around <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>, sweet and tasty. They 
used to be laboriously cut with scissors, but it's now done by machine.</p> 
<p>The photo specimens, about 0.019 inch wide and up to 4-1/4 inches long, 
were purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles for 2015 US $14.19 for 
6.5 ounces ($34.93 / pound). The weight used in a recipe is minuscule, so 
6.5 ounces will last a very long time. Problem is, they lose their bright 
red color in a year or so, which makes them useless as a garnish. For this 
reason, I usually seed Fresno chilis and cut into strips as thin as I can, 
then use them fresh, or dry them in my dehydrator for thinner.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Chili Powder, Japanese</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japonf02h.jpg" alt="Japone Chili Powder" class=mrg>  
<p>[Ichimi (One Flavor) (Japan); <i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>This is ground from Japone / Takanotsume type chilis so will be 
quite hot. It is used to spice up Udon soups, and in Shichimi (seven 
flavors) powder found in Soba shops. The specimen to the left is 
Japone powder.
