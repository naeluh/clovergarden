<h1>Mexican Chilis</h1> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; <h2>North <small>&amp;</small> Central America</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_mix00e.jpg" alt="Chili Mix" class=mrg>
<p><span class=bg>The Chilis of Mexico dominate the continental regions 
of North and Central America, </span>with very little overlap with South 
America. It is from Mexico and Central America that the Spanish took 
Chilis to Europe, while from Brazil the Portuguese took Hot Chilis to 
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>A few Chilis are found only in North and Central America, but not 
many, and those regions are too overwhelmed by Chilis from Mexico to 
support separate pages, so they are included here. Some of the Chilis 
listed here are types that have returned to the Americas after passing 
through Europe, and are widely grown here.</p>

<h2 id="anaheim">Anaheim</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_anaheim09e.jpg" alt="Whole Anaheim Chilis" class=mrg>
[Long Green, California Green, Chili Verdi, Chili Colorado, 
California Chili); <i>C. Annuum</i>]
<p>
Fresh green (Anaheim) or red ripe (Chili Colorado) or dried red 
<a href="cp_mexiz.html#calif"><b>California</b></a>), 6 to 11 inches by 2 inches. 
They are quite mild at (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>)
They are were originally brought from New Mexico to much more populous 
California and were renamed. They fit the "Long Green" description, 
but some other chilis do also.</p>

<p>These chilis are most common green but red ones are becoming more 
common here in Southern California. Both Red and Green have a taste 
and sweetness similar to <a href="cp_mexiz.html#bell"><b>Bell Pepper</b></a> but 
with a bit of a bite to them. They are fine to eat raw as well as 
cooked. I have been keeping Anaheim / Colorados in my fridge lately 
because the will still be good long after Bell Pepers have turned to 
rot, very important during COVID lock-down.</p>

<p>Anaheims are said to be somewhat milder than their New Mexico relatives 
but hotness varies. They are often used by restaurants for Chili Rellenos 
and other recipes that should be made with <a href="cp_mexiz.html#poblano">
<b>Poblanos</b></a> because they are large enough to stuff, available, 
low cost and because Poblanos can sometimes be hotter than they think 
their customers want. The Anaheim lacks the dark flavor of the Poblano, 
but is otherwise a fine chili.

<h2 id="ancho">Ancho</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ancho05h.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Ancho Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>Dried black <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1-H2</b></a>, 2 to 4 
inches. This is the dried from of the <a href="cp_mexiz.html#poblano">
<b>Poblano</b></a>, (shown to the left) and is one of the sweetest and 
most flavorful of the dried chilis. They are often used in Mexican 
sauces and recipes, often in combination with other dried chilis. They 
are sweeter, hotter and brighter in flavor than the <a href="cp_mexiz.html#mulato">
<b>Mulato</b></a> which has a very similar in appearance.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="banana">Banana Peppers</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_banan05e.jpg" alt="Long Yellow Banana Peppers" class=mrg>
[Yellow Wax Pepper, Hungarian Wax Pepper; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This name covers a number of similarly shaped waxy yellow peppers which 
may vary in heat and color, but they are most commonly yellow and of very 
moderate heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>). The ones 
commonly sold under the name here in the Los Angeles region mostly thick 
walled (much thicker than Hungarian peppers) and elongated with thin skins. 
They are very much like yellow Anaheims, but not as hot - good for 
roasting, stuffing or in recipes where Bell Peppers just aren't quite 
spicy enough or too strong in flavor. In contrast, those sold around 
here as "Yellow Wax Peppers" are usually much hotter. The photo 
specimens were typically 7-3/4 inches long and 1-7/8 inches diameter 
at the big end. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=bell>Bell Peppers</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08e.jpg" alt="Bell Peppers in various colors" class=mrg>
[Capsicum (British); Shimla mirch (India); Prik Pasom Sot (Thai); 
<i>C. annuum</i> var. <i>grossum</i>]
<p>
Green when unripe, red, yellow, orange, purple, white, pink, etc. when 
ripe. These are always sold fresh, and are only dried for use as 
industrial food additives. Box shaped to heart shaped, these large 
(up to 5 inches across) chilis feature thick, crisp and flavorful 
flesh with no heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>), making 
them popular in nearly every cuisine worldwide.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says the Bell Pepper originated in Szeged, Hungary in the 
1920s, and the USDA records the first commercial crop in the 
southeastern USA in 1925. On the other hand, Lionel Wafer wrote in 
1699, "Bell pepper is a large, fleshy mild green pepper, turning into 
red or gold when fully ripe". Further, Thomas Jefferson recorded 
receiving Bell Pepper seeds from Mexico in 1824, and the Boston Cooking 
School Cookbook of 1896 has a recipe for "Stuffed Peppers" calling for "6 
green peppers", so they must have been very well known at that time. 
In these peppers, the gene for producing capsaicin is replaced by a 
recessive form, so they lack the sting of other chilis. Mexibelle is 
a variety where this recessive gene has been overwritten by one that 
works, so the Mexibelle has a mild degree of hotness.

<h2 id="sthol">Striped Holland Pepper / Aloha Pepper&reg; <small>#3465</small></h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_stholland02e.jpg" alt="Four Striped Holland Peppers" class=mrg> 
<p>[Capsicum (British), <i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>This Bell Pepper was discovered in the Netherlands. It is now marketed in 
North America by Sunset as tropical "Aloha Pepper", even though it has 
nothing whatever to do with Hawaii or the tropics. Surprisingly, they taste 
just like Bell Peppers, and with heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">
<b>H0</b></a>). They can be eaten raw or cooked, and do retain their 
stripes when cooked.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="bbell">Baby Bell Peppers</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_babybell02h.jpg" alt="Baby Bell Peppers" class=mrg> 
[Capsicum (British), <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Fresh red, green, yellow and orange, <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">
<b>H0</b></a>. These look a lot like <a href="cp_mexiz.html#gypsy"><b>Gypsy 
Peppers</b></a> and other frying peppers but have much thicker walls, 
more flavor and are usually very sweet. The photo specimens were 4-1/2 
inches long, 2-1/4 inches across and weighed 3-1/4 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="bird">Bird's Eye Chilis / Bird Chilis</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_piri02c.jpg" alt="Piri Piri Chilis on Plant" class=mrg>
<p>A generic, almost meaningless term for small, usually very hot, 
chili pods. A few insist the name applies only to some very tiny 
spherical Southeast Asian chilis, much like American <a href="cp_mexiz.html#chilt">
<b>Chiltepins</b></a> or South American <a href="cp_samz.html#chara">
<b>Aji Charapita</b></a>. Others include those that ripen point up, and 
are eaten and dispersed by birds, mostly C. frutescens, like the 
<a href="cp_samz.html#piri"><b>Piri Piri</b></a> of Brazil and Africa. 
This is the definition I favor.</p>
<p>Others also include hot chilis like the <a href="cp_mexiz.html#thai"><b>Thai 
Chilis</b></a> we grow in California, which are small and hot, but are 
<i>C. annuum</i> and ripen point down. Wikipedia insists that <u>only</u> 
this category are "Bird's Eye Chilis", a defenition with which I do not 
agree. All-in-all, at least 50 varieties worldwide are called "Bird's 
Eye Chilis", particularly in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America.

<h2 id="calif">California</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_calif05h.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Calfornia Chili" class=mrg> 
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Dried red, 4 inches to 8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>. California chilis are 
usually dried red <a href="cp_mexiz.html#anaheim"><b>Anaheims</b></a> but can be a 
number of similar varieties. They can be used in mild Mexican sauces 
and are a major ingredient in <a href="chilip.html#cal"><b>California

[HP22BNH,; <i>C. frutescens x C. chinense</i>]
<p>
Originating in South Carolina in 2012, this chili still holds the world 
record for hotness (2020). Depending on growing conditions, these 
range from Scoville 1,150,000 to over 2,200,000.

<br><img src="img/cp_casc01k.jpg" alt="Whole Cascabel Chilis" class=mrg>
[Chili Bola; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Normally sold dried red, these are smallish round or heart shaped chilis up 
to about 1-1/2 inches diameter. They are used mostly in Mexican cooking, giving 
sauces a nutty flavor, and are readily available in the US Southwest. 
Moderately hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cayenne">Cayenne</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_cayenne06e.jpg" alt="Red and Green Cayenne Chilis" class=mrg>
[Prik khee fah (Thai); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Originating in French Guiana, this famous chili has been used to make the 
Cayenne chili powder used in many cuisines - except that powder is at 
least as likely to be made from some other variety and just labeled 
"Cayenne". Today there are many cultivars worldwide, but the Cayenne pod 
is generally long and thin, up to nearly 10 inches, and often curved 
at the tip. It is quite hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cherry">Cherry Pepper</h2>
<br><h2>Cherry Pepper - Hot</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_cherry01e.jpg" alt="Whole Red Cherry Peppers" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Fresh red spherical to slightly pointy, 1 inch in diameter, 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0-H1</b></a>. 
Cherry peppers are used for salad plates and mild pickles. Hot Cherry Peppers 
look exactly the same but will knock the socks off the unwary at  
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a> or hotter and can be used 
same as <a href="cp_mexiz.html#fresno"><b>Fresnos</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="chilaca">Chilaca</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_chilaca02e.jpg" alt="Whole Green Chilaca Peppers" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This pepper is fairly mild, <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2 to 
H3</b></a>, though can sometimes be a little hotter. It is also called 
<a href="cp_mexiz.html#pasilla"><b>Pasilla</b></a>, but that is properly the dried 
form. Unfortunately fresh <a href="cp_mexiz.html#poblano"><b>Poblanos</b></a> are 
often mistakenly called Pasillas, adding to the confusion. This is a 
medium thick fleshed chili with a slightly smoky flavor similar to a 
Poblano, but not as intense. The largest of the photo specimens was 
1-1/4 inches long and 1-1/8 inches in diameter at the big end.</p>
<p><a href="cp_mexiz.html#poblano"><b>Poblanos</b></a> are often called "Pasilla" in 
error so be sure which a recipe actually calls for - if it's for stuffing 
it probably actually wants Poblanos. Subst: Chilacas are rather scarce 
here in Southern California, but for many recipes Poblanos can be used. 
They are thicker walled, more intense in flavor, and heavier, so 
adjust as needed.

<h2 id="chilly">Chilly Chili Hybrid</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_chilly01h.jpg" alt="Fruiting Chilly Chili Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This new variety of ornamental chilis is "child safe" - the fruit 
has chili flavor, but no chili hotness at all. They look fierce, 
so you can challenge horrified friends to eat one, then eat one yourself 
to their amazement. You can scatter them over salads for decoration. The 
chilis grow to 2 to 2-1/2 inches long and up to 3/8 inch diameter, going 
from greenish to yellow to orange to red as they ripen. These plants are 
very prolific, but grow to only about 12 inches high. They like full sun. 
The photo specimen was purchased in late September 2018.

<br><img src="img/cp_tepin01h.jpg" alt="Whole Chiltepin Chilis" class=mrg>

<p>
These tiny (up to about 0.35 inch dried) but intensely hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>) chilis possibly arose in 
Bolivia and southern Brazil, and were scattered throughout Central and 
South America and the Caribbean by birds long before humans invaded the 
Americas. They are found as far north Arizona and New Mexico and are still 
harvested wild (thus are quite expensive - 2022 U.S. $11.96 / ounce in 1/4 
ounce bags). They are valued for their heat, complex flavor and medicinal 
uses. Their intense heat is sudden, but not long lasting, while that of 
the related <a href="cp_mexiz.html#pequ"><b>Pequin</b></a> builds more slowly but lasts 
longer.

Pronounced Chee-POT-lay, this is a smoked <a href="cp_jalapz.html">
<b>Jalape&ntilde;o</b></a>. They are widely used in the cuisines of 
Mexico, particularly Yucat&aacute;n. Chipotles will generally be

[Cahabonero, Chile Coban; <i>C. annuum</i> var <i>ceraciforme</i> or 
<i>C. annuum</i> var <i>annuum</i>]
<p>
Named for the city of Coban in central Guatemala, these tiny bird 
chilis have been the chili of choice in the region since Mayan times. 
They are used both fresh and dried smoked. The dried smoked are 
particularly used for making sauces. Being smoked, they are similar 
to <a href="cp_mexiz.html#chipot"><b>Chipotles</b></a> but are considerably hotter. 
The dried chilis are typically 0.60 inch long by 0.38 diameter, with 
hotness about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>, but fresh 
ones would be hotter. The photo specimens were purchased from the 
Central American section of a large Hispanic market in Los Angeles 
(Burbank) - 3 oz for 2016 US $1.69.

<p>[<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>This Chili is said to have been brought from southern Italy in 1887, 
and is now very much favored in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, 
and Cuba. They are called for in many recipes, but are not at all available 
here in Southern California, or in many other regions of North America, 
so Substitutions must be made. Cubanelles are usually very mild, solidly 
within hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>, but they can 
occasionally get to the high end of <a href="cp_hottab.html#h2">
<b>H2</b></a>. They are usually harvested while still yellow-green, but turn 
bright red if allowed to fully ripen. They have rather thin walls and grow to 
about 6 inches. For details and substitutions, see our

[Rat Tail Chili; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Meaning "Tree Chili", de arbols are grown primarily in Mexico but are 
common in dried form (and less common fresh) north of the border. Shown 
are fresh green, fresh ripening and dried red. It is a fairly hot chili 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>), 2 to 5 inches long and 
easily recognized from it's long, slender, sharply pointed shape. Dried 
de arbols are excellent when you want a bit more heat than the commonly 
available <a href="cp_mexiz.html#jap"><b>Japones</b></a> provide but not so much as 
dried Thai bird chilis.

<a href="cp_mexiz.html#tabas"><b>Tabasco</b></a> Chili and Grows to about 1-1/4 inch 
by 1/4 inch diameter, ripening from green to red. Some claim the 
Diente de Perro is a cayenne shaped <i>C. annuum</i> chili up to 
3 inches long, but I reject that based on photos and text from Guatemala, 
and that those don't look anything like a dog tooth or hen beak

["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is the chili chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as 
the medium hot fresh red chili suitable for their cuisines - and I 
have recently seen them listed in European chili lists. They are about 
hotness <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-5</b></a>. Core and seed them, 
but leave in the membranes (where the heat is) if you want some heat. 
With the membranes carefully removed they have little heat. They have 
good flavor, and the walls are quite thick, so they are not dried.

Dried red Mirasol chilis, 4 to 7 inches by 1-1/2 inches and moderately hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3-H4</b></a>), this chili is notable 
for its smooth skin and the flavor of chocolate. It is used in a number

<p>This one does not actually exist, but is taken from a famous cartoon

<a href="cp_mexiz.html#fresno"><b>Fresno</b></a>, though usually not as pointy.

long and 2-1/4 inches in diameter weighing 3-1/2 ounces.</p>
<p>Gypsys are currently (2017) much admired by chefs and yuppies though I 
really don't see the point. They have thin skins so can be fried and 
roasted and cook quickly (important in restaurants), but also have less 
flavor and a less favorable skin to flesh ratio than the much more 
flavorful <a href="cp_mexiz.html#bbell"><b>Baby Bell Peppers</b></a> which are

<br><a href="cp_caribz.html">
<img src="img/cp_habanor03h.jpg" alt="Orange Habanero Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This is a family of very hot chilis native to the Yucat&aacute;n 
Peninsula and surrounding areas. Its genus was named <i>C. chinense</i> 
by a botanist who saw them in China and thought they were native there. 
Taken to the Caribbean in pre-Columbian times, during Colonial times 
many were shipped from the port of Havana Cuba, thus the name meaning 
"of Havana". Few are grown in Cuba today because very hot food is not 
in style there now.</p> 

<p>While the Orange Habanero totally dominates here in Southern 
California, Habaneros also come in Red and Yellow. White, Pink and 
Brown varieties also exist. They have a unique fruity flavor, which, 
combined with their intense hotness (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10">
<b>H10</b></a>), makes them popular for hot chili sauces. Though they 
have very thin walls, they tend to rot quickly so are difficult to dry, 
unless you have a dehydrator, but they are available in that form. 
When you buy them fresh, keep them loosely wrapped in the refrigerator 
and plan to use them up in 5 days or so.</p>

These are a Mexican type chili that was taken to Hungary by the Turks, 
who probably got them from the Spanish. They are now widely grown in 
North America. They are yellow-green chilis with medium thick walls, 
crunchy texture and little or no heat 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0 - H1</b></a>). The center photo

This chili originated in Jalisco, Mexico, but has become well known in 
Asia, where China grows vast amounts for export.  They are easily 
identifiable by having no caps or stems. In North America, this is pretty 
much the default dried red chili, available everywhere. It has good 
flavor and is moderately hot at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7">

<p>
Native to southern Central America and northwestern South America where 
they have been cultivated for about 8000 years, these chilis are now 
grown from Mexico to Chile. They are popular in mountainous regions 
because they can stand colder weather than most chilis. The bush can 
live 15 years and grow as tall as 10 feet.</p>
<p>Ranging from green through yellow and bright red, round to bell shape 
and 1 to 2-1/2 inches diameter, they are fairly hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>), and have black seeds. 
They have fairly thick walls so they do not dry well. Manzana is the

They are also cultivated. Dried, they are up to 1/2 by 1/4 inch, and are 
similar to the wild <a href="cp_mexiz.html#chilt"><b>Chiltepins</b></a>, but larger and not 
as hot <a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>. They also posses a complex 
flavor, but somewhat different from the Chiltepins, while their heat builds 
up more slowly and lasts longer. They are less costly than the Chiltepins at 
2022 US $7.96 / ounce in 1/4 ounce bags.

<p>
Fresh green <a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>, rarely red 
ripe - dried red it is called <a href="cp_mexiz.html#ancho"><b>Ancho</b></a>. This 
large (4 to 6 inches), very dark green conical chili has fairly thick 
flesh with a unique flavor, but hotness and shape can vary widely.</p> 
<p>Poblanos are the correct chili for Chili Relleno, but many restaurants 
use the less flavorful <a href="cp_mexiz.html#anaheim"><b>Anaheim</b></a> for reasons 
of cost, availability and for fear of the somewhat erratic hotness of the 
Poblano. When a recipe calls for "Pasilla" chilis it almost always 
actually means "Poblanos", particularly if it calls for stuffing them. 
Real fresh green "Pasillas" are properly called <a href="cp_mexiz.html#chilaca">
<b>Chilacas</b></a>, "Pasilla" is properly the dried form. Chilacas are 
not only hard to find in Southern California but are long, narrow and

<p>Native to the mountains of Mexico, these are one of the most common

in Thailand. Here in North America, they are the "go-to" for fresh hot 
green chilis when chilis native to a particular cuisine are not 
available.</p>
<p>These have more flavor than most hot green chilis - but nobody seems 
to be complaining.  They are fairly hot (about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>), but the heat can be much 
reduced if necessary, by removing the seed mass and membranes. They are 
usually used green with the seeds in. They can be up to 4.5 inches 
(11.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) diameter. The flesh is fairly thick, 
so they are not dried, though they are often pickled.

These are now grown in California and widely available here in Southern 
California, both for themselves, and as a substitute for Spanish

are very rare), these chilis have unique lengthwise ridges and blunt 
ends. They have good flavor are generally very mild at 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>, but about 1 in 20 can surprise, 
cranking it up into the <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1">
<b>H1</b></a> range. This is the same as the much stubbier but similarly 
wrinkled Spanish Padr&oacute;n pepper, from which the Shishito Chili 
was probably developed. Like other California produce, they are tending 
to get larger (easier to harvest). For my earlier photo the largest was 
3 inches long and 1/2 inch diameter. A later purchase (Oct 2017) was 
up to 4-3/4 inches long and 7/8 inch diameter, but still very mild.

This chili, famous for being made into Tabasco Sauce and other Louisiana

This is the chili North Americans most think of as "Thai Chili", and 
the only one commonly grown and sold in North America. It is small, 
often less than 1-3/4 inches long as grown in Thailand, but there are 
many varieties and those grown in California are often up to 2-3/4 
inches (more efficient to grow and harvest large sizes). They are 
narrow, pointy and start growing point up, but turn downward as they 
reach full size. They turn from green to red when ripe (they may be 
somewhat orange in between). They are very hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8 to H9</b></a>), slightly less hot 
when red ripe, and a little less than that when dried. Fully red ripe 
these dry very well into fine dried red chilis, hotter than the common 
<a href="cp_mexiz.html#jap"><b>Japones</b></a>. Those imported from Thailand tend to 
be hotter than if you dried those grown in California. Some minor 
varieties are black if in full sun, turning bright orange when ripe.
