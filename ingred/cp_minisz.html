<h1>Mini Pepper, Sweet</h1>

[<i>Capsicum annuum</i>]

<p>These Peppers are usually available in produce stores here in Southern 
California, packed in ziploc plastic bags. They are quite versatile and flavor 
is good, walls are reasonably thick, and hotness is 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b> to <b>H1</b></a>. The 
largest in the photo was 3.10 inches long by 1.15 inches diameter (79 x 29 mm) 
and weighed 0.7 ounces.</p>

<p>I've found these very fine for just snacking, perhaps with a vinegar dip 
or other simple dip. When recipes call for Cubanelles, or "Italian Frying 
Peppers", which are not very available in Southern California, I'll use 3 or 
4 times as many of these, because their character is similar. I also find 
them fine for stuffing for parties. In some cases, when served with a sauce, 
I've cut a little off the point so they'll stand up well in an 
electric fry pan set to warm. This also allows some sauce to enter.
