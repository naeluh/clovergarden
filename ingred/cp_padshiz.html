<p>
From the concello of Padr&oacute;n  in the northwest corner of Spain, 
these peppers are wrinkly in shape and erratic in heat. The saying is, 
"Padr&oacute;n Peppers, some are hot, some are not". Those in the photo 
were grown in Southern California and were just a little hot. The largest 
was 2-3/4 inches long and 1-1/2 inches diameter. In weight they run from 
about 1/2 ounce to 1-1/4 ounces. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: &nbsp; The 
Japanese <a href="cp_padshiz.html#shis"><b>Shishito Chili</b></a> is an excellent 
substitute.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California these can 
occasionally be found in Farmer's Markets, at stalls that deal in unusual 
stuff. They must also be grown in Virginia, because La Tienda carries 
them (at a high price).<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These are very popular in Tapas Bars, fried 
briefly over high heat until blistered, sprinkled with coarse sea salt, 
and served as an appetizer.

[Japanese Chile; <i>C. annuum</i>]

<p>Fresh dark green (red ones are very rare), these chilis have unique 
lengthwise ridges and blunt ends. They have good flavor are generally 
very mild at <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0">H0</a> but about 1 in 20 can 
surprise, cranking it up into the <a href="cp_hottab.html#h1">H1</a> 
range. This is the same as the much stubbier but similarly wrinkled 
Spanish <a href="cp_padshiz.html#padr"><b>Padr&oacute;n</b></a> pepper, from which the 
Shishito Chili was probably developed. Like other California produce, 
they are tending to get larger (easier to harvest). For my earlier photo 
the largest was 3 inches long and 1/2 inch diameter. A recent purchase 
(Oct 2017) was up to 4-3/4 inches long and 7/8 inch diameter, but still 
very mild.</p>

<p>The name in Japanese translates roughly to "Lion Chili", as they 
imagine the end looks like a lion's head. I sure can't see that, but a 
people who can name a piloted suicide bomb "Cherry Blossom" is capable 
of any naming perversion.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  They are easy to find here in Southern 
California, in the Asian markets, particularly the Korean. Philippine 
markets also often have piles of them, because the mild Sili Mahaba 
is still very scarce here in Southern California. Some larger produce 
markets also carry them.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Like the Spanish Padr&oacute;n, these are 
frequently fried briefly over high heat until blistered, sprinkled with 
coarse sea salt, and served as an appetizer.<p></p>
