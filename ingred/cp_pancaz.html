[<i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>
This is the second most common chili in Peru, after the Aji Amarillo. 
It is similar in size, a bit larger, but deep red and very mild 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1">H1</a>), with a sweet, berry like, 
slightly smoky flavor. They are usually sun dried by the growers before 
taking to market, and then may be processed into paste. They are popular 
for use in stews and with fish and chicken. Taste of the dired 
chilis is much like Chili Ancho, but with less heat. Subst: 
Chili Negro, not quite the same flavor.</p>
<p>In North America, these chilis are uncommon dried, but more available 
as a paste. The photo specimens were purchased from a large market in 
Los Angeles (Burbank) that specializes in Mexican, Central American and 
South American foods. The center one wa 6-1/4 inches long and 1.33 inches 
wide.</p>
