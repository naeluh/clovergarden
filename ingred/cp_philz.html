<h1>Sili - Philippine Chilis</h1>

<p>
"Sili" is Filipino for Chili. In Filipino cuisine the chilis used are 
almost always either <i>Sili Mahaba</i> or <i>Sili Labuyo</i>, but there 
are complications. Here are described some named varieties with the best 
information I could gather on them. Filipinos are not very informative 
about their chilis and the naming used in Philippine markets here in 
Southern California is equally uninformative.

<h2 id="silih">Sili Mahaba</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_silisw02e.jpg" alt="Long Green Mahaba Chilis" class=mrg>
[Finger Pepper, 
  Siling Pangsigang (lit. chili for Sinigang), Siling Haba, Siling Espada, 
  Chili Picante, Long Pepper, Spanish Pepper; <i>Capsicum annuum</i> 
  var. <i>longum</i>]
<p>
A long yellowish green chili, 4 to 6 inches long, about 3/4 inch 
diameter at the stem end, and tapering to a point. Pinning down how hot 
Mahabas are has not been easy, as information from the Philippines 
is conflicting. I now have pretty reliable evidence that Mahabas are 
"mild to medium mild", which has allowed me to assign "Mahaba" to these 
chilis. They have just started to appear in quantity in a Philippine 
market near me (Eagle Rock, California), sold as "Chili Sweet" for 
2015 US $2.99 / pound.</p>
<p>These chilis ranged between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 inches 
long and 3/4 inch at the cap end. They varied in heat from almost no heat 
(a few) to distinctly sharp (most). The walls are fairly thin, and note 
the slight swelling just below the cap, which appears in most photos 
I've found of Mahabas. 
<br><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; Korean chilis sold here in Los Angeles are a 
little hotter and a little longer, but will serve in most recipes. If 
size is not an issue, the common Anaheims are probably good, though they 
are a lot larger and have thicker walls. Otherwise use hotter chilis 
such as Serranos or Indian and remove the seeds and veins.</p>
<p>To complicate things more, in 2007, the guy at Market Manila bought 
some 9 inch chilis he was told were "just like Mahabas, just bigger and 
greener", but they turned out to be blazing hot. Those are, to the best 
of my knowledge, as yet unidentified.

<h2>Shishito Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_padshiz.html#shis">
<img src="img/cp_jap14e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Japanese Shishito Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[Japanese Chile; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
The Philippine markets here in Los Angeles often have piles of these 
to use as a substitute for Sili Mahaba, which are still very scarce 
around here. Fresh dark green (red ones are very rare), these chilis 
have unique lengthwise ridges and blunt ends. They have good flavor 
are generally very mild at <a href="cp_philz.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>, but about 1 in 
20 can surprise, cranking it up into <a href="cp_philz.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a> range. 
Like other California produce, they are tending to get larger (easier 
to harvest). For my earlier photo the largest was 3 inches long and 1/2 
inch diameter. A recent purchase (Oct 2017) was up to 4-3/4 inches 
long and 7/8 inch diameter, but still very mild. For details see our 
<a href="cp_padshiz.html#shis"><b>Shishito Chilis</b></a> page.

<h2>Siling Fresno</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (some U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
Many Philippine recipes call for "Red Finger Chili" or "Long Red Chili". 
These would be the red ripe Sili Mahaba, impossible to find in North 
America, even in Los Angeles. While we grow a dozen green chili varieties 
here, so many of our ethnicities have accepted the Red Fresno for their 
cuisines, the only fresh red chilis much available here are the Red Ripe 
Fresno and the Red Thai Chili. Their hotness is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b><b>H4-5</b></b></a>, but they are easily disarmed 
by removing seed core and membranes. If shape is an issue, you'll have to 
track down Holland Reds, sometimes sold in the big chain supermarkets. 
Fresnos are most reliably found in Asian markets, particularly Korean 
and Southeast Asian. For details see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<b>Fresno Chilis</b></a> page.

<h2 id="silil">Siling Labuyo</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_sililab01h.jpg" alt="Ripening Labuyo Chilis" class=mrg>
  [lit. "Wild Chili"; <i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>
The standard really, really hot pepper of the Philippines, small, 
somewhat blunt on the end, extremely hot, about  
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>) and may be red, yellow or 
white when ripe. They were once listed as the world's hottest 
chilis, but have long been displaced with much hotter chilis. They 
are becoming scarce in the Philippines because growers find the 
longer, pointier Thai chilis easier to grow and harvest, and sell 
them as "Siling Labuyo", but some complain the flavor is different 
and they are not as hot.
<br><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; The obvious substitute is the widely 
available Thai chili, since that is displacing Siling Labuyo in 
the Philippines. They are somewhat milder (so use more), thinner, and 
quite a bit longer and more pointy. A local Asian grower may have short 
hot bird peppers more similar to Labuyos.

<h2>"Siling Labuyo" / Thai Chili</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_thai24h.jpg" alt="Rat Turd Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>[Prik Ki Nu (Thai); Mak Pet Ki Nuu (Laos); Scuds (some chefs); 
<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>
This chili has been supplanting the real Siling Labuyo in the Philippines 
because it is easier to grow and harvest. It is often sold as "Siling 
Labuyo", but Filipinos complain it isn't as hot as the real one and has 
a different flavor. This chili is quite hot, about  
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>), slightly less hot when red 
ripe, and a little less than that when dried. It is small, often less than 
1-3/4 inches long as grown in Thailand, but there are many varieties and 
those grown in California are often up to 2-3/4 inches (more efficient 
to grow and harvest large sizes) and are often less hot than they should 
be. They are narrow, pointy, and start growing point up, but turn 
downward as they reach full size. They turn from green to red when ripe, 
but there are bright orange varieties too.

<h2 id="silib">Siling Bilog / Siling Parasco</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_bellsg02h.jpg" alt="Small Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
<p> [Atsal, (Philippine); Rounded Pepper, 
  <i>Capsicum annuum</i> var <i>grossum</i>]</p>
<p>
Basically these are medium size Bell Peppers, same as ours, and 
are generally used green. They may be used as a vegetable ingredient 
or a shell for stuffing. 
<br><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; None required, we have plenty of green bell 
peppers in North America, and even some medium size ones.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="leaf">Chili Leaf</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_leaf03h.jpg" alt="Chili Leaves" class=mrg>
[Dahon ng Sili (Philippine)]
<p>
These are used in a number of recipes. In the Philippines they are 
usually from Siling Labuyo, but what chili variety they come from is 
not particularly important, as the leaves have no heat. Those I've 
purchased in Southern California were from the chili I've now been able 
to identify as Sili Mahaba. Chili leaves are also used in Thailand to 
make green curry past greener.
