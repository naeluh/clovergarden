<h1>Manzana / Aji Rocoto</h1>

<p>
These two chilis are both of the same species, <i>Capsicum 
pubescens</i>, varying mainly in color and region where grown. They 
are popular in mountain regions because the plants can stand colder 
temperatures than many chilis. Unless color or size is very important, 
they can be interchanged in recipes. These chilis are fairly hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">H8</a>), but have more flavor than many 
chilis in this heat range. They have fairly thick walls, so don't dry 
well. The Manzana / Rocoto is the only widely cultivated species of 
<i>C. pubescens</i>, and is the only common chili with black or dark 
brown seeds.

<h2>Manzana Chilis</h2>  
<p><img src="img/cp_manzana06f.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Manzana Chilis" class=mrg>
  [Manzana, Canario (yellow ones), Peron (Mexico); Manzano, Chile de 
  Caballo, Qsacyol (Guatemala); <i>C. pubescens</i>]
<p>
Native to southern Central America, these chilis have been cultivated 
for about 8000 years, and are now grown from California to Guatemala. 
The bush can live 15 years and grow as tall as 10 feet. Manzana chilis 
range from green to yellow and orange, round to bell shape and 1 to 
2-1/2 inches diameter.</p>

<p>The orange ones in the photo are the most common variety in Southern 
California, but other colors can sometimes be had from farmer's markets. 
The photo specimens were purchased from a large Los Angeles (Burbank) 
market that specializes in Mexican, Central American and South American 
foods, but a few less specialized markets also have them. The largest 
was 2 inches diameter.</p>

<h2>Aji Rocoto</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_rocoto04f.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Rocoto Chilis" class=mrg>
[Rocoto, Locoto (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia); <i>C. pubescens</i>]
<p>
Native to northwestern South America, these chilis have been cultivated 
for about 8000 years, and are now grown from Ecuador to Chile. The bush 
can live 15 years and grow as tall as 10 feet. Aji Rocoto are mostly 
red in South America, but can also be green to orange. They are round 
to bell shape and 1 to 3 inches diameter.</p>

<p>Aji Rocoto tend to be larger than the orange Manzanas, and in Peru 
are often stuffed like Bell Peppers are here. The photo specimens 
were purchased from a large market in Los Angeles (Burbank) that 
specializes in Mexican, Centeral and South American foods, mixed in 
with orange Manzanos. The largest was 2-1/2 inches diameter and 2-1/8 
inches high, but I have purchased frozen ones from Peru up to 3 inches 
diameter.</p>

<h2>Aji Rocoto Paste:</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_rocotop01e.jpg" alt="Aji Rocoto Paste" class=mrg>
This product is very important 
in Peru, and available in North America from specialty markets and 
on-line. Because the only significant ingredients are Rocoto Chilis, 
salt and citric acid, it can often be used in recipes calling for fresh 
chilis. The photo specimen was purchased from a large market in 
Los Angeles (Burbank) that specializes in Mexican, Central American and 
South American foods. 2017 US $3.99 for an 8 ounce jar. &nbsp; Ingred: 
Rocoto hot pepper, salt, citric acid, potassium sorbate.

<h2 id="powd">Locoto Powder:</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_locotop01d.jpg" alt="Aji Rocoto Powder" class=mrg>
[Locoto en Polvo, Chiles Picantes (Spanish); "Hot Spyccy Peppers" (English);
<i>Capsicum pubescens</i>]

<p>This is one of the few forms of Hot Chili available in Argentina for folks 
desiring some chili heat. They're usually from somewhere else, and so is this 
chili powder. It's imported from Bolivia, and  sold by verdularias (green 
grocers), many of whom are from Bolivia.
