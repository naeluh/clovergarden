<h2 class=lrg id="spain"><u>Chilis of the Spanish Regions</u></h2>
<p></p>

<p>"Aji" (pronounced Ah-hee) is the word for Chili Peppers in Spanish 
Speaking South America and the Caribbean. It is from the Taino word 
"ax&iacute;". The Taino were the original inhabitants of much of the 
Caribbean, but were driven almost extinct by the Spanish and diseases 
they brought. The Spanish took the word "Aji" to much of South America.
</p>
<p>The Spanish took Mexican Chilis back to Spain, and there specialized 
in breeding sweet and semi-hot chilis, unlike the Portuguese, who spread 
stinging hot chilis throughout the world.</p>

<hr class=hr4s>
<br>

<h2 id="andes" class=lrg>Chilis <small>of the</small> Andean Region</h2>

<p>The Andes mountains extend from the central spine of Colombia all the 
way down to the tip of Chile. Colombia cuisine is generally pretty 
mild, so we place it in the North, with this section covering Peru, 
Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile.</p>

<p>While the rest of the world concentrates on <i>C. annuum</i>, 
<i>C. frutescens</i>, and <i>C. chinense</i>, the Andes region along 
the west coast of South America has stuck with its own native species: 
<i>C. pubescens</i> and <i>C. baccatum</i> with almost no involvement 
with those other species.</p>


   
<h2>Aji Amarillo</h2>
<br><a href="cp_ajiyz.html">
<img src="img/cp_ajiamar06e.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Aji Amarillo Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. baccatum</i> var. <i>pendulum</i>]
<p>
This chili is most commonly associated with Peru but is also used 
in Bolivia. The <i>baccatum</i> species originated in Peru and/or 
Bolivia and still dominates the Andes region today. The name means 
"Chili Yellow", but it ripens to a bright orange. Some sources say 
they turn yellow ("amarillo") when cooked, but they actually stay 
pretty orange. This is a fairly hot variety 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>) but variable, and grows 
to 3 to 6 inches long. In Peru they are used mostly fresh, but in 
Bolivia they are dried and ground. A number of products are made from 
this chili, see <a href="cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Aji Mirisol:</h2>
<br><a href="cp_ajiyz.html">
<img src="img/cp_ajiamaril05h.jpg" alt="Dried whole chilis" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. baccatum</i> var. <i>pendulum</i>]
<p>These are dried Aji Amarillo. The photo specimens, purchased from 
Catalina's Market in Los Angeles, were typically 4.3 inches long by 1.15 
inches across. Seeds from one of these were planted to produce the photo 
specimens above.

<h2 id="chara">Aji Charapita</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajichar05h.jpg" alt="Whole Aji Charapita Chilis" class=mrg>
[Wild Chilean Chili Pepper; Cumari (Brazil); <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This tiny chili, is very popular in Peru, and is also well known in 
Brazil. It is a fairly hot chili 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>) with a fruity flavor, 
and is a popular houseplant in Peru, so it is instantly available when 
fruiting. The usual way of eating it is to crush a fresh ripe chili with 
your fork to get some juice on it, then use the fork to flavor the food.
</p>
<p>The plant is bushy and can produce hundreds of chilis, but has just 
recently been put into cultivation. My two plants did almost nothing 
the first year, but grew rapidly the second year and produced around 80 
chilis per plant. In their third year they look to be producing about 
140 per plant. The chilis were 0.280 inches diameter or less, but some 
varieties are said to produce fruit approaching 1/2 inch. Don't leave 
ripe chilis on the bush. One year some bird came and ate nearly 200 
chilis in one day - birds can't detect chili heat and aren't bothered 
by it.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="ajil">Aji Limo</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajilimo04h.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Aji Limo Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. baccatum</i> var. <i>pendulum</i>]
<p>
This chili is most commonly associated with the north coast of Peru, 
where it is essential to the proper flavor of the Ceviches made there. 
It is also used in other dishes, particularly rice dishes, and described 
as having a "citrus spice" taste when cooked.  
It is smaller and a bit hotter than the Aji Amarillo, around  
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>, and can be green, yellow or 
red, and white and purple varieties are known. The name comes 
from a common lemon yellow variety, also called "Lemon Drop". The photo 
specimens were from my own plants.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="roco">Aji Rocoto</h2>
<br><a href="cp_rocotoz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_rocoto04h.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Red Rocoto Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[Rocoto, Locoto (Peru, Bolivia); Manzano, Chile de Caballo, Qsacyol 
(Guatemala); <i>C. pubescens</i>]
<p>
Native to northwestern South America, these chilis have been cultivated 
for about 8000 years. They are the same species as the orange Manzano 
chilis of Mexico, but red ones predominate in South America. They are 
popular in mountainous regions because they can stand colder weather 
than most chilis. A major chili in Peru, they are also used in the far North 
of Chile, but are too hot for the rest of the country. The bush can live 
15 years and grow as tall as 10 feet.
</p>
<p>They Range from green to yellow, orange and bright red, round to bell 
shape and 1 to 3 inches diameter, they are fairly hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>), and have dark brown or black 
seeds. They have fairly thick walls so they do not dry well. Rocoto is 
the only widely cultivated species of <i>C. pubescens</i>. The photo 
specimens were purchased from a large market in Los Angeles (Burbank) 
that specializes in Mexican, Central and South American foods, mixed 
in with orange Manzanos.

<h2 id="ajip">Aji Panca</h2>
<br><a href="cp_pancaz.html">
<img src="img/cp_panca03e.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Panca Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>
This is the second most common chili in Peru, after the Aji Amarillo. 
It is similar in size, a bit larger, but deep red and very mild 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h1"><b>H1</b></a>), with a sweet, berry like, 
slightly smoky flavor. Usually dried by the growers before taking to 
market, they are popular for use in stews and with fish and chicken. 
In North America, they are uncommon dried, but more available as a 
paste.

<h2 id="bish">Bishop's Crown</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bishop04h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Bishop Crown Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>
This oddly shaped chili is probably native to the region around Bolivia, 
but is now grown, mainly as a curiosity, in North America, the Caribbean 
and Europe. The flesh is thin but crisp and it has rather little 
heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h2"><b>H2</b></a>), all of which is 
concentrated up near the stem. While its characteristics do not strongly 
encourage culinary usage, as a decorative the plant puts out a lot of 
bright red chilis that hang like little bells, about 1-5/8 inches 
across the widest part. It yields well only in the first year.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="juani">Juanita Chili</h2>
<br><a href="cp_juanitz.html">
<img src="img/cp_juanita06h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Juanita Chilis" class=mrg></a>
[Peppadew&reg; Pepper, Malawi Piquant&eacute;, Sweet Piquant&eacute; Pepper;
<i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>These chilis are best known from South Africa, where they are cored and 
pickled with plenty of sugar. They clearly originated from South America, 
and may still be found there. They are of moderate heat 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h3"><b>H3</b></a>) with a taste similar 
to red bell peppers.
<a href="cp_juanitz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cryst">Aji Crystal</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajicrystal01k.jpg" alt="Whole Aji Crystal Chilis" class=mrg>
[Aji Verde; <i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>This is the dominant chili in Chile, where really hot chilis are avoided. 
This one is moderately hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5">
<b>H5</b></a>) similar to a Jalape&ntilde;o.  They are usually eaten when 
light green or yellow-green, but will eventually mature to red. They can be 
up to almost 4 inches long.

<h2 id=merq>Merqu&eacute;n</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_merquen02h.jpg" alt="1/4 Teaspoon of Merqu&eacute;n Flake" class=mrg>
[Merk&eacute;n]
<p>This is a smoked chili flake made from Aji Cacho de Cabra (Goat Horn Chili), 
and is a specialty of the Mapuche people of southern Chile. The chilis are 
dried, smoked then ground to flake and mixed with salt (merk&eacute;n natural), 
or about 70% chili, 20% salt, and 10% coriander seed (or 7% coriander seed 
and 3% cumin seed) (merk&eacute;n especial). The photo specimen, imported from 
Chile, was fairly hot, distinctly smokey, and did include cumin. &nbsp; Subst: I have ground up Guatemalan Chili Cobanero, which 
worked well. Others suggest a mix of Smoked Paprika and a little Hot Chili 
Powder. Ground Chipotle are considered much too hot.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="ajipast">Peruvian Chili Pastes</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_ajipast02e.jpg" alt="Peruvian Chili Pastes" class=mrg>
These four chili pastes are much used in Peru and Ecuador, and to a 
lesser extent in Bolivia and southwest Colombia. Because the only 
significant ingredients are Chilis, Salt and Citric Acid, they can be 
used in many recipes where fresh chilis are called for but are not 
available. All these pastes were made in Peru and purchased from a 
large Los Angeles Hispanic market, or on-line. 
<p><b>&#164; &nbsp; Aji Amarillo:</b> &nbsp; (upper left) &nbsp; This is 
the most important paste, made from fresh <a href="cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Aji 
Amarillo</b></a> chilis. Like them, it is quite hot, but not excessively so.
<br><b>&#164; &nbsp; Aji Mirasol:</b> &nbsp; (upper right) &nbsp; This 
paste is made from dried <a href="cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Aji Amarillos</b></a>, 
called Aji Mirasol. Like the Amarillo paste, it is fairly hot but not 
excessively so.
<br><b>&#164; &nbsp; Aji Rocoto:</b> &nbsp; (lower left) &nbsp; This is 
the second most important paste, made from fresh 
<a href="cp_rocotoz.html"><b>Aji Rocoto</b></a> chilis. It is quite a bit 
hotter than the Aji Amarillo pastes.
<br><b>&#164; &nbsp; Aji Panca</b> &nbsp; This paste, made from dried 
Panca chilis, is far milder than any of the other Peruvian chili pastes 
and has a slightly smoky flavor.

<br>

<h2 id="north" class=lrg>Chilis <small>of</small> Northern South 
America</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Here we consider only <b>Colombia</b> and <b>Venezuela</b> as 
Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana are inseparable from the 
Caribbean. For those chilis we refer you to our page 
<a href="cp_caribz.html"><b>Chilis of the Caribbean</b></a>.</p>
<p>Northern South America is noted for relatively mild cuisine. Chili 
sauces are made as condiments, and a few dishes adopted from outside 
the region feature chilis. Colombia actually grows a huge amount of 
Tabasco and Cayenne chilis, but for export to North America and Europe, 
not for local consumption.</p>
<p>In the mountains of Central Colombia and along the Pacific coast, what 
few Chilis are used are the same varieties used in Peru. On the 
Caribbean coast, the Aji Dulce predominates, and other Caribbean chilis 
are used very cautiously.</p>

<h2>Aji Dulce</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajidul02e.jpg" alt="Aji Dulce, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Aji Cachucha, Ajicito; <i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>This chili is a variety of the fiercely hot Scotch Bonnet, and is very 
popular in Venezuela, and on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. My new plant 
was vigorous and produced some samples. I cut one open and was instantly 
assailed by the unmistakable aroma of a super-hot chili. I bit into a slice. 
The taste was sharp and stinging, an apt introduction to the terrible flames 
to come. The flames never came, just the tropical fruity taste of the Scotch 
Bonnet without the heat. In some recipes of the Caribbean coast, a number of 
Aji Dulce will be combined with a single hot Scotch Bonnet or Habanero. 
These chilis are about 1.12 inches diameter by 1.10 inches high, including 
the pointy tail.
<br class=cll></p> 

<h2>Habanero</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_habanor03h.jpg" alt="Orange Habaneros, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
[<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>These hot chilis are not so much used in Colombian and Venezuela, but 
are essential to a few dishes, particularly Columbian Aji Picante dip 
and/or condiment. Those shown in the photo are the Orange Habanero 
which dominates in California, but these chilis come in red and yellow 
also. They feature very high heat (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h10">
<b>H10</b></a>) and a fruity flavor.
<br class=cll></p> 

<h2 id="bp">Black Pearl</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_blkpearl02h.jpg" alt="Black Pearl Chilis on Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annum</i>]
<p>
This chili was developed in Colombia, and is now fairly well known. With 
its small round fruits, deep black maturing to bright red, and it's 
black-purple leaves, it is quite striking. It is a decorative rather 
than culinary chili. The photo is from a plant I had, and I was quite 
disappointed with both hotness and flavor, but it did look good. 
<br class=cll></p>

<hr class=hr4s>
<br>

<h2 id="east" class=lrg>Chilis <small>of</small> Southeastern South 
America</h2> 

<p>This Region, consisting of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, is almost 
a "chili free zone". It is extremely beef, pasta, and baked goods oriented, 
and under very heavy European influence (particularly Spanish and Italian), 
essentially no native population at all. Moderately hot Chili Flake (Aji 
Molido / Aji Triturado) is used very cautiously, as in most of Europe, but 
mild Spanish Paprika is quite common. Bell Peppers are used a fair amount.
</p>

<h3>Locoto</h3>
<br><a href="cp_rocotoz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_rocoto04h.jpg" alt="Rocoto Chilis" class=mrg></a>
I can include this fresh chili only because I've found in an Argentine 
cookbook (written in Spanish) a single recipe for "Sopa Norte&ntilde;a" 
which calls for one <i>aji picante</i>, defined specifically as "Locoto". 
Norte&ntilde;a probably refers to Bolivia, where the 
<a href="cp_rocotoz.html"><b>Locoto</b></a> chili is widely used. OK, it's 
not specifically an Argentine recipe, but it is in an Argentine cookbook 
written in Argentina, and it implies Locoto chilis might be somewhat 
available in Argentina. I've been told many Argentine verdularias (green 
grocers) are from Bolivia, so that would be where to look. For details 
see <a href="cp_rocotoz.html"><b>Manzana / Aji Rocoto</b></a>
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Locoto Powder</h3>
<br><a href="cp_rocotoz.html#powd">

[Locoto en Polvo, Chiles Picantes (Spanish); "Hot Spyccy Peppers" (English);
<i>Capsicum pubescens</i>]

<p>Some people in Argentina do like some chili hotness, especially if they 
came from somewhere else. Their choices are quite limited, but this powder 
is available, imported from Bolivia, and  sold by verdularias (green 
grocers), many of whom are from Bolivia. It is fairly hot at about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Aji Molido / Aji Triturado</h3>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajimol02h.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Aji Triturado Flake" class=mrg>
[Aji Molido (ground chili), Aji Triturado (crushed chili) (Argentina)]

<p>This is a fairly mild chili flake, about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h5">
<b>H5</b></a> (both Molida and Triturado are flake). It is an essential 
ingredient in traditional Argentine Chimichurri Sauce, which is absolutely 
essential for serving with grilled meats, and without grilled meats, could 
there even be an Argentina?  It is often made from Aji Mirisol (dried Aji 
Amarillo), usually mixed with other mild chilis. Aji Mirisol is much used 
in Bolivia to the north, and the chilis are also grown in the Bolivian 
corner of Argentina. The photo specimen is of an Argentine brand sold in 
Argentina.
<br class=cll></p>


<hr class=hr4>
<p><br></p>

<h2 class=h1 id="port"><u>Chilis <small>of</small> Portuguese Brazil</u></h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Brazil</h3> was a Portuguese colony, and Portuguese 
remains the dominant language of the region. Brazilian cuisine is 
significantly different from the Spanish regions due to the vast 
Amazon Basin with its flora and fauna, and also heavy influence of 
Black Africans from the era of slavery. Today Brazil is 47.7% White, 
7.6% Black, and 43.1% Pardo (White, Black and Natives mixed in various 
proportions).<p></p>

<p>The word for chilis in Brazil is "Pimenta". While the Spanish took 
chilis home from Mexico and developed mild chilis in Spain, Portuguese 
sailors carried the stinging hot chilis of Brazil to India, East and 
Southeast Asia, and Africa - even to Japan.</p>

<p>Brazil is the origin region for species <i>Capsicum chinense</i>,  
and <i>Capsicum frutescens</i> is also significant there. Many 
interesting chilis grow in the region, but almost none of them are 
known or available in North America. I hope to be able to expand this 
section over time, though I may have to grow the chilis myself.</p>

<h2>Cumar</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_ajichar05h.jpg" alt="Whole Aji Charapita Chilis" class=mrg>
[Wild Chilean Chili Pepper; Aji Charapita (Peru); Cumari (Brazil); 
<i>C. chinense</i>]
<p>
This tiny chili, is very popular in Peru, and is also well known in 
Brazil. It is a fairly hot chili 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8"><b>H8</b></a>) with a fruity flavor. 
For full details see <a href="cp_samz.html#chara"><b>Aji Charapita</b></a> on this

<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="piri">Malagueta / Piri Piri</h2>
<br><a href="cp_samz.html">
<img src="img/cp_piri03h.jpg" alt="Small Red Bird Chilis on plant" class=mrg></a>
[Piri Piri, Peri Peri, etc. (Portugal, Africa); <i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>
Up to 2 inches long, these are standard bird chilis. Larger ones are 
called Malagueta in Brazil and Portugal, smaller ones are called Piri Piri 
in Portugal and Malagueta in Brazil. They are pretty much identical to the 
Piri Piri chilis of Africa, because those were brought to Africa by the 
Portuguese. They are quite hot at 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>). Subst: Thai Chilis, not as 
hot but much more available. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; many food 
writers have fallen afoul of confusion between Malagueta Peppers and 
Melegueta Pepper, a spice seed in the Ginger family also known as 
<a href="gg_gofpz.html"><b>Grains of Paradise</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="bstar">Brazilian Starfish Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_brazsf02e.jpg" alt="Brazilian Starfish Chilis, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[<i>C. baccatum</i>]
<p>These may have originated in Peru, but were domesticated in Brazil. 
They are apparently quite variable, but mine are medium hot 
(to <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>). One small one will 
provide enough heat for 5 cups of soup. The plant is rangy and sprawls, 
producing prolifically in it's first year, but may produce little or 
nothing in its second year. The fruit can grow to 2 inches across, 
but mine only grew to 1.4 inches and 0.7 inches thick. Most were smaller. 
This is a very usable chili fresh, but also dried.  The crisp, slightly 
sweet flesh is thick and the skin is tough, so they need to be split in 
half for drying, even in a dehydrator. Once ground, the red color fades 
quickly.
<br class=cll><p>

<h2>Brazilian Hot Sauce</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_scbraz02h.jpg" alt="Brazilian Hot Sauce" class=mrg>
[Molo de Pimenta, Salsa de Pimenta]
<p>
Probably made from Malagueta peppers, this sauce is similarly hot to 
North American Tabasco sauce, but is thicker and redder because it also 
contains non-hot red peppers. I find a half and half mix of Tabasco 
and Tapat&iacute;o gets pretty close, though the color isn't quite as 
bright. The photo specimen is Predilecta brand, said to be the most 
popular in Brazil. Ing: red pepper pulp, water, vinegar, salt, chili 
pulp, xanthan gum, potassium sorbate.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Mendez Hot Sauce</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_mendez2h.jpg" alt="Mendez Hot Sauce" class=mrg>
[Salsa Mendez]
<p>This Hot Sauce is now very popular in Brazil, and available on-line in 
North America. Hotness is similar to our Tapat&iacute;o, around 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4</b></a>), but the taste is very different. 
Clearly it is made from yellow South American Chilis. Ing: Mix of special 
chili peppers, vinegar, sunflower oil, sea salt, preservatives (INS) 200,202, 
thickener (INS) 415, antioxidants (INS) 330.
