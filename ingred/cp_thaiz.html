<h1>Chilis - Thai <small>&amp;</small> Southeast Asian</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/cp_thai22e.jpg" alt="Thai Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>C. frutescens</i> and <i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>
This page deals directly with chilis used in Thailand, because Thai 
usage is so familiar here in Southern California, but the page has 
been expanded with information regarding other regions of mainland 
Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Many kinds of chilis (<i>Prik</i> or <i>Phrik</i>) are grown in 
Thailand, and terminology, by time it's translated to English, is very 
confusing and sometimes just plain wrong. Much less information is 
available from other Southeast Asian countries. Details of size and 
hotness are difficult to find for those not available in California. 
Asian sources don't bother with these details because "everyone already 
knows". Several of the smallest chilis are called "Bird Peppers", but 
this name is not at all unique to Thailand. Here you will find my 
descriptions as best I could gather from a multitude of sources.</p>

<p>While all chilis, from the tiniest beads to the big bell peppers, 
originated in Central and South America, chilis are so variable that 
unique varieties have been developed in many countries for local use. 
While more than 75 varieties are grown in Thailand alone, I list here 
the most important.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of the Thai chilis only prik ki nu is readily 
available in Los Angeles.  Even in Thai Town (Hollywood Blvd east of 
Western) they have only prik ki nu, serranos, jalapenos and maybe 
Fresnos, so substitutions have to be made - unless you grow them 
yourself (seeds are readily available on-line).</p>

<h2>Prik Ki Nu</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_thai24e.jpg" alt="Rat Turd Chilis" class=mrg>
[Rat Turd Chili; Mak Pet Ki Nuu (Laos); Nga Yut Thee (Burma); Scuds 
(some chefs); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is the chili we most think of as "Thai Chili", and the only one 
commonly sold in North America. It is small, often less than 1-3/4 inches 
long as grown in Thailand, but there are many varieties and those grown 
in California are often up to 2-3/4 inches (more efficient to grow and 
harvest large sizes). They are narrow, pointy and start growing point 
up, but turn downward as they reach full size. They turn from green to 
red when ripe (they may be somewhat orange in between). Red ripe they 
are called <i>prik ki nu daeng</i>. They are very hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h8">H8 to H9</a>), slightly less hot when red 
ripe, and a little less than that when dried. Fully red ripe prik ki nu 
dry very well into fine dried red chilis, called <i>prik ki nu daeng 
haeng</i>. Those imported from Thailand tend to be hotter than if you 
dried those grown in California. Some minor varieties are black if in 
full sun, turning bright orange when ripe.

<h2 id="prif">Prik Chee Fah</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_holland08h.jpg" alt="Holland Red Chilis" class=mrg>
[Spur Chili; Mak Pet Nyai (Laos); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These are pointy like the prik ki nu, but are much larger, up to nearly 
6 inches long, and not as hot. They also grow point up, in fact the name 
means "pointing to the sky". In Thailand they are sold green, red and 
dried, but I haven't seen them in Southern California. 
<a href="cp_thaiz.html#holland"><b>Holland Red</b></a> would probably be closest to 
fresh red ones, though around here <a href="cp_thaiz.html#fresno">
<b>Red Fresnos</b></a> are the standard medium hot red chili used by 
every ethnic group. The photo specimens are actually Holland Red, which 
look exactly like photos of Prik Chee Fah I've seen taken in Thailand, 
and they fit the description. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="prig">Prik Kariang</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_thaikar01k.jpg" alt="Karen Chilis" class=mrg>
[Karen Chilis; <i>C. frutescens</i>]
<p>
These are shorter than prik ki nu, proportionally wider and even hotter. 
They are a classic "Bird Chili", very small, very hot 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h9"><b>H9</b></a>) and growing point up. They may be 
green, yellow, orange red or purple, and can sometimes be found from an 
Asian grower in a farmer's market. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="prik">Prik Kaeng</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_puya09h.jpg" alt="Puya Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annum</i>]
<p>
These chilis are used particularly in northern Thailand, and an important 
roasted flake is made from them. They are not yet available in North 
America, but expert opinion is that Mexican Puya chilis are a fine 
substitute - about the same size, flavor and hotness 
(<a href="cp_hottab.html#h4"><b>H4-H5</b></a>). The photo specimens are Puya, 
about 4-1/2 inches long. They are available from some markets 
serving a Mexican community. Easier to find Gujillas are a little larger 
and a little less hot, but similar.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="prio">Prik Lao</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_priklao01h.jpg" alt="Laotian Chilis" class=mrg>
[Mac Pet (Laos); <i>C. annum</i>]
<p>
These are the most popular chilis in Laos, thus the name Mac Pet (Hot 
Chili) with no modifier. They are plumper and longer (up to 3 inches) 
than the Prik Ki Nu, and usually blunt at the end. They are also 
significantly less hot (<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5-H6</b></a>). 
They are sold at several stages of ripeness, green, yellow, orange and 
red. &nbsp; <small>Photo borrowed from Swedish seed seller 
<a href="http://jalapeno.nu">Jalapeno.nu</a></small>, but they don't 
have any for sale.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Prik e Noo Kaset / Serrano</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_serrano20h.jpg" alt="Green Serrano Chilis" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>C. annuum</i>]</p>
<p>
These are regular Serrano chilis, now grown in Thailand for use in table 
condiments and hot sauces. They were Introduced to Thailand by visitors 
and returnees from California. Before Thai chilis were much grown in 
Southern California we used Serranos for Thai table condiments. Now some 
restaurants have gone to a 4 cup condiment tray so guests can have both 
Thai chilis and the more flavorful Serranos. I understand Sriracha sauce 
is now being made in Thailand from red ripe Serranos. Serranos are thick 
walled and do not dry well, so are always used fresh or pickled. Their 
hotness is about <a href="cp_hottab.html#h6"><b>H6</b></a>, but somewhat 
variable.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="priy">Prik Yuak</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_yuak01h.jpg" alt="Yellow-Green Yuak Chilis" class=mrg>
[Mac Pet Nyai (Lao); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is a fairly large, mild yellow-green to yellow chili, sometimes 
called "Thai sweet pepper". While mild, it is not completely without 
heat, but is used as a vegetable rather than as a seasoning. It is 
similar to low heat Banana Peppers, which would make good substitutes. 
Mild Hungarian peppers would also work, though they have a blockier 
shape. Prik Yuak is used extensively in salads and stir fries, and is 
also often stuffed.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="pril">Prik Luang</h2> 
<br>This bright orange aromatic chili is fairly mild and larger than 
prick chee fah. They are used in salads, chili pastes and meat dishes. 
I have never seen one here in Southern California, but if you must 
have an aromatic, orange, not-too-hot chili, I recommend the Peruvian 
<a href="cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Aji Amarillo</b></a>. It is available whole 
frozen, and in paste, sauce, dried and other forms. Authenticity? Not 
to worry, <u>all</u> chilis came originally from South and Central 
America.<p></p>

<h2 id="prih">Prik Haeng</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_thaidry01h.jpg" alt="Thai Dried Chilis" class=mrg>
[Mac Pet Haeng (Laos)]
<p>
These small, very hot dried red chilis made from Prik Ki Nu, Prik 
Kariang or similar. Thai recipes using them often end in "Prik Haeng". 
Those in the photo I dried myself, as I do whenever one of the local 
markets has a batch of really fine bright red Thai chilis. Very hot, 
but not quite as hot as fresh chilis of the same type. They are easily 
available imported from Thailand, and the imports are somewhat hotter 
than the California grown.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="fresno">Prik Fresno</h2>
<br><a href="cp_fresnoz.html">
<img src="img/cp_fresno11h.jpg" alt="Fresno Chilis" class=mrg></a>
["Red Jalapeno" (U.S. supermarkets); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is <u>not</u> a Thai chili (at least not yet), but it has been 
chosen by all ethnicities in Southern California as the medium hot red 
chili suitable for their cuisines. Their hotness is about 
<a href="cp_hottab.html#h5"><b>H5</b></a>, but they are easily disarmed 
by removing the core and membranes. Leave the membranes if you want them 
reasonably hot.  Use it in place of <i>Prik Chee Fah</i> - unless shape 
is an issue. If it is, you'll have to track down Holland Reds, sometimes 
sold in the big chain supermarkets. For details 
see our <a href="cp_fresnoz.html"><b>Fresno Chili</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Japones</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_japon05h.jpg" alt="Dried Japones Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Hontaka, Santaka, Chinese chile pepper; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili originated in Jalisco, Mexico, but you are likely to find 
them much used in Asian restaurants here in North America - it's pretty 
much the default dried red chili here. It's available everywhere, easily 
identifiable by having no caps or stems. It has good flavor and is 
moderately hot at low to mid <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>.  
It is reported to be much used in Szechuan and Hunan, China, and also 
to some extent in Thailand. It is a good chili to use when Thai Chilis 
are going to be too hot.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>de Arbol</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_arbol08h.jpg" alt="Dried de Arbol Chilis" class=mrg>  
[Tree Chili; Rat Tail Chili; <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This is NOT a Southeast Asian Chili, at least not yet. It is included here 
because is is widely available in North America and works well in Southeast 
Asian and Indian recipes. Their hotness falls conveniently between the Japones 
and dry red Thai Chilis at a high <a href="cp_hottab.html#h7"><b>H7</b></a>, 
and they have good flavor, especially when toasted. They are 2 to 5 inches 
long and easily recognized from their long, slender, sharply pointed shape. 
They are mostly grown in Mexico.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Shishito Chili</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_jap11h.jpg" alt="Shishito Chilis" class=mrg>
[<i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
This chili, common here in Southern California, is included on this page 
because one of my Burmese cookbooks has a photo labeled "Mild Green Chilis". 
Those chilis looked exactly like Shishitos except much shorter, like the 
Spanish Padr&oacute;ne, from which both are probably descended. They have 
almost no heat, except about 1 in 20 can surprise. Burma has common borders 
with both Thailand and Laos, so chilis like these may also be seen in those 
countries. The longest chili in the batch from which the photo specimens 
were drawn was 4-1/4 inches, not counting stems. For details see our 
<a href="cp_padshiz.html#shis"><b>Padr&oacute;n &amp; Shishito</b></a> 
page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Prik Pasom Sot</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_bell08k.jpg" alt="Bell Peppers" class=mrg>
[Nga yohk kaung (Burma); <i>C. annuum</i> var. <i>grossum</i>]
<p>
These are regular red, green and yellow bell peppers. Yes, they use them 
in Thailand, but not to nearly the extent they are used in China.  Their 
hotness is <a href="cp_hottab.html#h0"><b>H0</b></a>, though 
occassionally one will show a trace of heat. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pickled Red Chilis - Asia</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cp_pklthai02h.jpg" alt="Whole Pickled Red Asian Chilis" class=mrg> 
<p>These chilis are called out mostly for the cuisines of Sichuan and 
Hunan China, but those available here in California are invariably 
packed in Thailand. I presume the Thais also use them. They may be 
pickled Japones, moderately hot, around <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">
<b>H4-H5</b></a>, and are from 2 to 2-1/2 inches long. Ingred: Red Chili, 
Water, Salt, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium 
Metabisulfite.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="holland">Holland Red</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_holland08h.jpg" alt="Whole Holland Red Chilis" class=mrg>
[Dutch Red, Cabai Merah (Indonesia); <i>C. annuum</i>]
<p>
These are popular in Holland and its former colonies in Indonesia as well 
as other parts of Europe and North America. A cayenne type pepper sold 
fresh and red ripe, 4 to 6 inches long by 5/8 inch diameter and tapered 
to a sharp point, they are medium hot <a href="cp_hottab.html#h4">
(<b>H4-5</b>)</a>. They have thicker flesh than some long narrow chilis 
and sweet taste.  They Probably would be about right for Sichuan and 
Hunan recipes, and are a good choice for most ethnic cuisines. The much 
more available <a href="cp_thaiz.html#fresno"><b>Red Fresnos</b></a> are a good 
substitute, though of different shape and thicker walled.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="leaf">Bai Prik</h2>
<br><img src="img/cp_leaf03h.jpg" alt="Chili Leaves" class=mrg>
[Chili Leaf; Bai Prik (Thai); Bai Mak Pet (Laos); Dahon ng Sili 
(Philippine)]
<p>
What variety of chili plant these come from is not very important as 
they have no heat and little flavor. They are used mostly for color, 
particularly in Thai Green Curry Paste, to make it bright green without 
using so many green chilis it is too hot. In Laos They are used in soups 
and stews, and similarly in the Philippines.  I have most often found 
them in Philippine markets, but I also get them from my own chili plants.
