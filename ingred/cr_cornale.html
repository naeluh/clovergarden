<h1>Order &nbsp; - &nbsp; Cornales</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Dogwood order (<b><i>Cornales</i></b>) includes about 600 species, 
many highly valued as decoratives and some valued for their wood, but 
only a very few are notable for edible fruit. Many are, however, 
important for production of honey by bees.

<h2 id="olime">Ogeechee Lime</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cr_ogeech01h.jpg" alt="Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[White Tupelo, River lime, Sour gum, Wild lime; 
<i>Nyssa ogeche</i> of family <i>Cornaceae</i>]
<p>This small to medium tree is native to a band extending from 
the southern tip of South Carolina expanding diagonally across Georgia 
into northern Florida, including the eastern half of the Panhandle. It 
requires very moist sites, preferring river banks, and can grow to nearly 
50 feet high. The fruit is usually a little over 1-1/2 inches long, with 
thick, juicy, very sour flesh and a single seed. It is used to make 
preserves and beverages. The tree has been heavily planted along the 
lower Apalachicola River (southwestern Georgia and central Florida 
Panhandle) for commercially valuable tupelo honey produced by bees.

<h2 id="dogb">Cornelian Cherry</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cr_dogbry04e.jpg" alt="Whole and cut fruit" class=mrg>
[Dogberry, European Cornel, Dogwood; Shan zhu yu (China); 
<i>Cornus mas</i> of family <i>Cornaceae</i>]
<p>This shrub or small tree is native to southern Europe from 
France through Turkey, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, and also Iran, 
Lebanon, Syria and China. The bright red or yellow fruit is usually a 
little over 3/4 inche long and 5/8 inch diameter with one seed, but in 
Ukraine they have commercially grown varieties that produce fruit over 
1-1/2 inches long. The photo examples, shipped frozen from Lithuania, 
were up to 0.8 inch long and 0.53 inch diameter, weighing an average 
of 0.47 oz (1.6 gms) each.</p>
<p>The fruit is sour and not fully ripe until it has fallen from the 
tree. The ripe flavor has been described as a mix of cranberry and 
sour cherry. Through its range, the fruit is used to flavor alcoholic 
and non-alcoholic beverages. It is particularly popular in Georgia, used 
to make various preserves and as an ingredient in sauces. The fruit is 
eaten with salt as a snack in Turkey and Iran.

<p>The fruit is sweet and the custard-like pulp is considered delicious, 
though the skin is tough and the pulp seedy. It is sometimes made into 
wine.Young leaves can be cooked as greens.
