[Colchis Bladdernut, Caucasian Bladdernut; Jonjol (Armenia); 
<i>Staphylea colchica</i>]
<p>
   Native to Republic of Georgia, this small tree (to 10 feet) produces 
   panicles of small white bell shape flowers that develop into 
   bladder-like fruit containing seeds. The flowers are edible and 
   decorative in salads. They are much sought after in Georgia for use 
   as pickled appetizers. The seeds can be pressed to yield an edible 
   oil. The seeds are about 1/4 inch long.</p>

<p>The picking season starts in early May, and this usually results in 
some Georgians detained by Russian border guards in breakaway South 
Ossetia. They are handed over to Ossetian authorities and face a fine 
of about 2000 Russian rubles (US $30) for crossing the border, but back 
in 2011 a group of 12 was fired upon with 2 killed and 4 wounded.</p>

<p>This is a light brine pickle with an interesting and unusual lightly 
floral taste, remotely suggestive of capers. It is often served with 
chopped red onion, olive oil, pepper, and sometimes other pickled 
vegetables. It is considered a "must have" for a Georgian supra 
(traditional feast table). They are similarly served in Armenia and in 
Georgian restaurants in Russia. In Georgia they are sometimes used as 
a garnish for Georgian Lobiana (Bean Soup).</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Here in Southern California pickled Jonjoli 
are occasionally available in markets serving a Georgian / Armenian 
community, usually labeled "Capers in Brine". Well, they are pickled 
in brine, but they certainly aren't capers, nor related to capers. 
The photo specimens were purchased in a 26 ounce jar from a 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2016 US $5.69 for 
the jar. Ingred: "Capers", salt, garlic, wine vinegar, pepper, 
spices. If you want to buy them on-line, search for "Georgian 
Capers".</p>
