<h1>Cucumbers</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Cucumbers (<i>Cucumis</i>) are the signature members of 
family <i>Cucurbitaceae</i> (Cucurbits), which also includes melons, gourds 
and squash</span> - all "Cucumbers" to the botanist. To the agriculturist 
they are all "Vine Crops" and they are all fruit, but in culinary practice 
cucumbers are generally considered "vegetables" even though they are most 
often used raw.

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Cucumbers are probably native to northern India and were cultivated 
there and in Western Asia well over 3000 years ago. They were much 
favored by the Romans who spread them to other parts of Europe. They 
didn't get to England until about the 14th century, and have to be grown 
in hothouses there. Cucumbers arrived in the Americas in the early 16th 
century. When they arrived in China and Japan is uncertain but is 
thought to be somewhat later than their arrival in Rome.</p>

<p>The durable "green blimp" cucumbers we are accustomed to in the U.S. 
are a relatively recent development. In earlier times cucumbers were 
similar to the Persian and often thinner and longer.</p>

<p>Besides the fruits, which botanists call a "modified berry", young 
shoots and leaves of the vine can be cooked and eaten as greens.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="use" class=lrg>Using Cucumbers</h2>

<p>There are two locations of flavor in cucumbers, the skin and the seed 
mass. Sample an over-ripe cucumber and you'll find the slightly yellow 
seed mass to have a stronger and quite distinctly cucumber flavor. 
Personally I don't mind that flavor, in moderation, but some people 
don't like it.</p>

<p>You'll find many sources telling you English cucumbers have more 
flavor than the standard garden cucumber. Peel them both and you'll find 
the garden cuke more flavorful, it's just that the English doesn't have 
to be peeled and the thick bitter skin of the garden variety does.</p>

<p>A better compromise is to use Persian or Japanese cucumbers which have 
thin non-bitter skin but enough seed mass to be more flavorful than the 
English. Unfortunately they don't keep and have to be used within a few  
days. Kerbys are midway between in seediness, bitterness, and toughness 
of skin, and also are not waxed.</p>

<p>for best flavor the seed mass should be included in recipes if 
possible. This is not possible in cases where the liquid will bleed out 
and dilute the recipe - then the seeds must be scooped out. When I do 
this I scrape the seeds into a bowl, add some salt and eat the seed mass 
as a snack while I cook.</p>

<p>Recipes that call for seeding cukes usually presume the big "green 
blimps" but if you use Persians or Japanese cucumbers you probably won't 
have to seed them (or peel them) and flavor will be better.</p>

<p>In salads, once the dressing is applied, Cucumbers will start to 
bleed water due to salt in the dressing. If you need your salad to 
be durable, as for long buffet service or making ahead, slice the 
cukes for the recipe, then put them in a bowl, sprinkle well with 
salt and let sit for at least 20 minutes - longer is better. Then 
rinse them and drain them. You may need to cut down the amount of 
salt in the recipe, as the cucumbers will retain some salt.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Cucumber Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="blimp">Cucumber - (standard issue)</h2>
<br><a href="ck_blimpz.html">
<img src="img/ck_blimp03h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Garden Cucumbers" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Garden Cucumber, Pole Cucumber, Market Cucumber, Green Blimp;
<i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
</p><p>
These cucumbers are grown on fully functional vines with both male and 
female flowers, so they have a large seed mass and plenty of seeds. 
Consequently they have more real cucumber flavor than seedless varieties, 
provided you use the seed mass.</p>

<p>The skin is fairly tough and bitter so they are almost always peeled. 
Since they'll be peeled anyway growers seal them with a heavy coating of 
wax for longer storage - they'll last at least two weeks in the fridge. 
You do want to peel them because you don't know who sponsored the FDA 
studies certifying that wax as "edible".</p>

<p>Size varies widely but the photo specimen is 9-1/4 inches long, 2-3/8 
inches diameter and weighed 1-1/4 pounds. A more typical supermarket size 
would likely be 12 ounces to a pound but 2 pounders are often available at 
produce markets. The cut one was picked quite young so the seeds are 
immature and the seed mass is relatively small. When cucumbers become 
over-ripe they start to yellow, the seeds start to harden and the seed 
mass gets a stronger flavor.

<h2 id=beij>Beijing Cucumber</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_beijing02f.jpg" alt="Whole and cu Beijing Cukes" class=mrg>
[Peking Cucumber]<p>
Though it looks sort of like an overgrown European cucumber with tiny 
white spine spots all over it, the Beijing is not "seedless". It can, in 
fact have a higher proportion of seed mass than a garden cucumber does, 
improving the flavor over seedless varieties.</p>
<p>The skin is very thin and they are not waxed so you don't have to peel 
them, but it means they will spoil quickly so use them right away.  The 
larger photo specimen was 19 inches long, 2 inches diameter and weighed 1 
pound 6 ounces. So far these are available in only a few of the East / 
Southeast Asian markets in Los Angeles and prices are still a quite high - 
about 2016 US $1.19 / pound, while Persians can be had here for 69 cents 
/ pound, and gardens for less than 25 cents / pound in season.

<h2>Dosakai</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_dosakai01k.jpg" alt="Gherkin" class=mrg>
[Lemon Cucumber, <i>Cucumis. sativus</i>]
<p>
These cucumbers get their name from being about the size and shape of a 
lemon, and bright yellow varieties are popular in India. The photo 
specimens are green with whole or broken stripes, the variety grown in 
Southern California. They are seldom available even in Indian markets and 
are sold at a high price so they're more a curiosity than practical 
ingredient right now.</p>

<p>These cucumbers are sweeter than other varieties and do not need to be 
peeled. They go well in salads but in India they are most often cooked as 
an ingredient in recipes or made into pickles and chutneys.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>English Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="ck_euroz.html">
<img src="img/ck_eng06d.jpg" alt="English Cukes" class=mrg></a>
[#4593, Hothouse Cucumber, Burpless Cucumber, Seedless Cucumber, 
  European Cucumber, <i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
<p>
This is a variety of the European Cucumber selected for large size and 
straightness. This makes them more economical to shrink wrap in plastic 
to extend their shelf life. The photo specimen  was fairly typical at 
14-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches diameter at the thickest point and 
weighed 14 ounces. See 
<a href="ck_euroz.html"><b>European Cucumber</b></a> for all further 
details.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>European Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="ck_euroz.html">
<img src="img/ck_euro05d.jpg" alt="European Cukes, whole and cut" class=mrg></a>
[Hothouse Cucumber, Burpless Cucumber, Seedless Cucumber, English 
Cucumber]<p>
These cucumbers are grown on vines that produce only female flowers. 
Since the flowers have no way to get knocked up they produce seedless fruit. 
Seeds to grow them are expensive because to produce them, rare vines that 
have one or more male flowers must be found.</p>
<p>Growing the vines take special care so bees and other pollinating 
insects cannot access the flowers, or hybrid seeds will develop. Larger 
straighter varieties are shrink wrapped in plastic for longer shelf life 
so they can be shipped to distant markets and are called 
<b>English Cucumbers</b>.</p>
<p>The larger of the photo specimens was 13 inches long (uncurled) 1-3/4 
inches diameter at the thickest point and weighed 10 ounces. Typical 
shrink wrapped specimens are a little bigger but generally weigh less 
than a pound.

<h2>Gherkin - True</h2>

(French); Pepino das Antilhas, Cornich&atilde;o das Antillas, Machiche, 
Maxix&eacute; (Portuguese); <i>Cucumis anguria</i>]
<p>
True Gherkins are a small non-<i>sativa</i> cucumber native to southern 
Africa from Zaire south to Botswana and naturalized in Madagascar, but 
are best known for cultivation in the Caribbean region. The non-bitter 
less spiky varieties developed in the Caribbean have been reintroduced 
to Africa and are now cultivated there. In Africa, leaves of the bitter 
varieties are used as greens, and some of the non-bitter varieties 
are pickled. In the U.S. this plant is grown in gardens for private use 
in Florida.

<h2>Gherkin - Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="ck_cgherkz.html">
<img src="img/ck_cgherk02h.jpg" alt="Pickles" class=mrg></a>
[Cornichon (French), <i>Cucumis sativa</i>]<p>
Any tiny immature cucumber used for pickling, generally less than three 
inches long. Since few people have ever seen a real gherkin this naming 
has been a successful subterfuge.</p>
<p>India has become a major grower and pickler of these cucumbers taking 
advantage of low labor rates, but this industry is ecologically 
questionable and there have been contract abuses as well. The photo 
specimens are from Bulgaria with the largest measuring 2-7/8 inch long, 
7/8 inch diameter and weighing 5/8 ounce.

<h2>Hothouse Cucumber</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; see

<h2 id="jap">Japanese Cucumber</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_jap06e.jpg" alt="Japanese Cukes" class=mrg>
[<i>Cucumus sativus</i>]
<p>
Not seedless but with much fewer seeds than garden cucumbers, and they 
are harvested when the seeds are very immature so are not noticeable. 
Japanese cucumbers are sold unwaxed. They are several varieties, but 
they generally have bumpy dark green skins, which may have white spine 
dots. They are similar to the 
<a href="ck_persz.html"><b>Persian</b></a> cucumber but much larger 
and most varieties are sturdy enough to be grown in open fields in 
California. There are varieties ranging up to three feet long and 2 
inches in diameter but the most popular are 8 to 12 inches long and 
very straight.</p>
<p>Millions are grown in Southern California but they are 
rarely seen in markets, because our thousands of sushi bars (most of 
which, to the distress of the Japanese, are run by Koreans now) 
consume the crop. The photo specimens, purchased from a Korean market 
in Los Angeles (La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge) were up to 14 inches long, 
1-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 2-5/8 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="kirby">Kirby Cucumber</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ck_kirby07k.jpg" alt="Kirby Cukes" class=mrg>
[Liberty Cucumber, Pickle, <i>Cucumus sativus</i>]
<p>
You can't pickle a waxed cucumber so these are never waxed. That means 
you can eat them skins-on but also they will spoil quickly - even in the 
fridge they'll start getting slimy in just a few days. Peeled they have 
a little less flavor than the <a href="cucumb.html#blimp">Green Blimps</a> because 
the seed mass is so immature - they're often picked so young they look 
almost "seedless".</p>
<p>These vary greatly in size depending on how young they're picked. The 
largest of the photo specimens was 5-1/4 inches long, 2 inches diameter, 
and weighed 7-3/8 ounces. The smallest was 3-1/2 inches long, 1-3/8 
inch diameter at the big end and weighed 1-3/4 ounces.</p>
<p>The skin is a bit tougher than that of the seedless varieties (though 
not bitter) so for some uses you may wish to peel them, or they may be 
partially peeled to decorative effect. They do well in salads and for 
cooking.as well as for pickling.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Peking Cucumber</h2> - See <a href="cucumb.html#beij"><b>Beijing Cucumber</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h2>Persian Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="ck_persz.html">
<img src="img/ck_persian03h.jpg" alt="Persian Cucumbers" class=mrg></a>
[Mediterranean Cucumber (obsolete market name); <i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
<p>
A mostly seedless cucumber normally sold unwaxed, so you can eat them 
skin-on. There are several cultivars, so they may vary somewhat in 
size and shape, but they all taste the same. Persians tend to have a 
few seeds, but they are picked so young they are no bother. These are 
wildly popular here in Los Angeles, every produce market having a 
mountain of them. The photo specimens averaged 7 inches long, 1.5 inches 
diameter, weighing 5-3/4 oz. This is larger than average. Vegetable crops 
in California keep getting bigger for ease of harvesting - but now there 
is a "Mini" version too - see 
<a href="ck_persz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Pickle</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_pickle02h.jpg" alt="Pickles" class=mrg>
[<i>Cucumis sativus</i>]
<p>While many vegetables are pickled, the cucumber so dominates the form 
it's the one you can call just "pickle" without a modifier. The cucumbers 
used are <a href="cucumb.html#kirby">Kirby</a> type or similar in the U.S. but other 
varieties may be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Quick pickles" are made with cucumbers, a vinegar brine and spices. 
Natural pickles are made by packing cucumbers with water and salt to 
naturally ferment and make their own sourness. They are then cleaned up 
and processed with spices and other ingredients depending on what style 
pickle you're making.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2> Wild Cucumber - California</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_wild09e.jpg" alt="Wild Cucumbers" class=mrg>
[Cucamonga Manroot, <i>Marah macrocarpus</i>: California Manroot, 
<i>Marah fabaceus</i>: other <i>Marah</i> species &nbsp; &nbsp; also 
<i>Echinocystis lobata</i>]
<p>
These perennial cucumbers are quite different from <i>Cucumis</i> 
cucumbers in the way the fruit functions. Rather than fleshy, the fruit 
is spiny and dry. When ripe it dries completely and splits at the end to 
spill the large seeds out. The fruit is not eaten and some say the unripe 
seeds may be "mind altering" but I haven't tried to find out. California 
Manroot is found over most of the state while Cucamonga Manroot is found 
over most or Southern California down to Baja.</p>
<p>All parts of the plant are bitter but the leaves have reportedly been 
used as a vegetable. The root tubers can weigh well over 200 pounds and 
were crushed by Native Americans for a toxin to stun fish with, so you 
probably don't want to try eating those. A soap-like substance has been 
extracted from the roots.</p>
<p>I have lots of these on my property in La Crescenta, CA, but growth 
and fruiting are very dependent on early spring rainfall. The photo, 
showing foliage, an unripe fruit, a just opened fruit with seeds, and a 
drying empty pod was taken during 2008, a very good year for these. This 
year, 2014, there was very little foliage and no fruit.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Wild Cucumber - Other</h2>
<p>
"Wild Cucumber" is a name used commercially for the 
<a href="ml_armoz.html">Armenian Cucumber</a>, which is actually a 
melon. There is also an African Wild Cucumber (<i>Cucumis africanus</i>) 
which looks a lot like the California item but they're not closely 
related, and the African one is edible. Fruit and leaves are eaten in 
Africa but only fruit in Madagascar.
</p> 

<hr class=hr2s>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Cucumbers are largely water and eaten at an early stage where their 
seeds are immature and haven't developed much protein. They aren't 
nutrition powerhouses but they do have a broad range of vitamins and 
minerals in significant amounts, and they are very low in calories and 
fat.</p>

<p>Way back in the early '70s I used to get a nutritional publication from 
one of Ralph Nader's organizations. Ralph was saying pickles should be 
taken off the market because of their cost / nutritional content ratio 
was so low. The vitamin C content is degraded by pickling but some other 
nutrients may become more available - but I really don't think people are 
eating pickles for their nutritional value, Ralph. They eat them for 
taste. Of course Ralph was also saying Yogurt should be taken off the 
market because it was too much to pay for a glass of milk.</p>
