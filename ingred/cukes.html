<h1>Cucurbitales - Order</h1>
<br><h2>Vine Crops - Cucumbers, Squash, Gourds <small>&amp;</small> Melons</h2>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
To the botanist, these large families are all "Cucumbers" 
(Cucurbits or <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>), so that 700 pound pumpkin you saw 
last Halloween is actually just a cucumber. To the Agriculturist they 
are all "vine crops". They all do have pretty much the same structure, 
both plant and fruit (with minor exceptions). Squash are New World 
versions while Cucumbers, Gourds and Melons were known from Africa to 
Japan for thousands of years, but in the Americas only since about 1500.

<h2 class=lrg id="hist">Cucurbits - General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Why should we care what's a Cucumber, Winter Squash, Summer Squash, Pumpkin, 
Gourd or Melon? Which is which in culinary terms is not always clear, but 
if you know what they are you know a lot about how they will cook. Gourds, 
for instance, may look a lot like summer squash, but they cook quite 
differently. It's also important if you're trying to use the right thing 
for an ethnic dish.</p>

<a href="cucumb.html"><h2>Cucumbers</h2></a>
<br><a href="cucumb.html">
<img src="img/ck_ckmix10m.jpg" alt="Cukes" class=mrg></a>
Cucumbers (C.Cucumis.sativus) originated in India and are harvested 
short of maturity when they are green and the flesh is white, crisp and 
watery (they are never hollow). They are often pickled but also eaten raw 
in salads and sometimes cooked. When mature they turn soft, yellow and 
quickly rot. <a href="cucumb.html"><b>Varieties and Detail</b></a>.

<br><a href="squash.html">
<img src="img/sq_mix01m.jpg" alt="Squash" class=mrg></a>
Squash (including Pumpkins) 
are all originally from North, Central or South America, and nearly all belong 
to the genus Cucurbita (Cucurbit Cucurbita for clarity - (thanks, guys)). They 
were unknown in Europe, Africa or Asia until after 1500 but many are popular 
there now. Some squash dry out to a hard shell and become the decorative 
"gourds" you see around Thanksgiving, but they aren't really gourds.

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <p><b>Summer Squash</b> [Marrow (UK)] are harvested quite immature and are 
   generally cooked, but are sometimes used raw in salads. They have thin tender 
   skins, watery flesh and are not hollow because the seed mass is filled with 
   pulp. They are easily overcooked, producing a mush with skins in it so use 
   care. Summer squash need refrigeration and even so don't last more than a week. 
   Most are botanically C.pepo which may have originated in North America 
   but was used mostly in Mexico before 1500.</p>

   <p><b>Winter Squash</b> are harvested when the seeds are mature. They have 
   hard outer skins, very solid flesh and the seed area is hollow except 
   for seeds and fibers. They can be stored at room temperature even for 
   months (though edibility may decline). Botanically they may be C. maxima 
   (South American), C.moschata, C.mixta (Cushaws (North America)) or 
   C.pepo (Mexico).</p>

<a href="gourds.html"><h2>Gourds</h2></a>
<br><a href="gourds.html">
<img src="img/gd_winter07m.jpg" alt="Ash Gourd" class=mrg></a>
Gourds originate from India, Asia and Africa. Many dry out 
when mature leaving a hard durable shell, hollow and with seeds rattling 
around inside. They are often used decoratively and for containers, but 
some are harvested when immature and eaten, particularly Luffas (which 
produce the familiar Loofa bath sponge when mature) and Bottle Gourds. 
These are particularly nice for cooking because the flesh holds shape 
rather than mush down like squash.

<p>The big container gourds the American Southwest is famous for are 
actually Old World (Cucurbit Lagenaria) gourds brought by the Spanish 
(there is a possibility some crossed the Atlantic to South America before 
the Spanish). Again, Thanksgiving decorative "gourds" are actually dried 
New World C. pepo squash, and Calabash "gourds" aren't gourds either, 
they're the fruit of a tree related to begonias.

<br><a href="melons.html">
<img src="img/ml_water10m.jpg" alt="Melon" class=mrg></a>
Melons originated in Africa and Western Asia and are 
generally eaten mature when the flesh becomes sweet. The rind is tough but 
not hard and the flesh is always watery. Most are eaten raw but some are cooked, 
particularly in soup. Most have thick walls and a hollow center containing 
seeds, but others (Watermelon) are solid and uniform all the way through. 
Most varieties will store at room temperature maybe a week and not much 
longer refrigerated but some will last a few months.

<h2 id="begon">Begonias</h2>
<br><img src="img/ck_begont01h.jpg" alt="Begonia Flowers" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Begonia</i> of family <i>Begoniaceae</i>]
<p>
Yes, begonias are related to cucumbers. Not all begonias are edible, 
and some are edible in different ways. Those most commonly considered 
edible are the tuberous begonias (as in the photo) <i>Begonia x 
tuberhybrida</i> and the Wax Begonia <i>Begonia cucullata</i> which has 
escaped and is growing wild in Florida. Of course, you must be certain 
your begonias have not been exposed to insecticides or herbicides. Leaves 
and flowers of these two are edible, and petals are often used to 
decorate fancy salads. Flavor varies somewhat with color.</p>
<p>Begonia leaves have been cooked as vegetables from India through China 
and Japan, and throughout Southeast Asia including Philippines, 
particularly in soups and sauces. They are also used similarly in Brazil 
and Mexico. Leaves are also sometimes used in salads. Note that begonia 
leaves contain a significant amount of oxalic acid, the substance that 
makes spinach tart, and they may have a slight bitter aftertaste.

<br><img src="img/ck_karaka01h.jpg" alt="Fruit on Shrub" class=mrg>
[New Zealand Laurel; <i>Corynocarpus laevigatus</i> of family 
  <i>Corynocarpaceae</i>]
  <p>
This leafy tree, native to New Zealand, grows to about 32 feet high. 
It produces orange fruit that was important to the native Maori. The 
flesh is edible but somewhat bitter. The seed kernels are highly toxic. 
Reports from the 19th century say the Maori had a complex multi-day 
process to detoxify the kernels. This process had to be carried out 
carefully and completely. The result of not doing so would be violent 
convulsions and muscle spasms so severe they could leave the limbs 
permanently stuck in unusual positions, though death was only 
occasional. Personally, I don't think I'll try these.
