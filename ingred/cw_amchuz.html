[Amchur, Green Mango; <i>Mangifera indica</i>]
<p>
In India some mangos are picked green (unripe), cut, dried and sold as chunks 
or in powdered form (Amchoor powder). This is a very important souring agent 
in the drier and more northern areas of India where lemons and limes are 
expensive and quickly rot. As a powder it is light weight and lasts a long 
time, similar to the <a href="cw_cashew.html#sumac"><b>Sumac</b></a> used 
in the Levant and Near East.

<p>Amchoor is a very convenient ingredient in dry Masalas (spice mixes) and 
widely used in that way. It is also used in stir fries, curries, chutneys, 
pickles, fruit salads, and pastry fillings, anywhere a sour and somewhat 
fruity flavor is desired. It is also used in marinades for meats as it 
provides tenderizing enzymes.</p>

<h3>Amchoor Powder</h3>
<p>This is the form in which Amchoor is most commonly available, and most 
easily used. It is available in any Indian market and in many multi-ethnic 
markets here in North America.
