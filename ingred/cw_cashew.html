<h1>Cashews / Mangos</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>The Cashews (<i>Anacardiaceae</i> of order 
<i>Sapindales</i>) are a medium sized family of resinous trees and 
plants, mostly tropical but some temperate</span>. Some provide highly 
prized edible fruit, but many have an irritant in their sap which causes 
rashes in humans, poison ivy being the most notorious in North America.

<h2>Cashews</h2>
<br><a href="cw_cashz.html">
<img src="img/cw_cashewa02e.jpg" alt="Cashew Fruits with Nuts" class=mrg></a>
[Mara&ntilde;on (Spanish); Caju (Brazil); <i>Anacardium occidentale</i>]
<p>
The Cashew is native to Brazil which is still a major grower, though 
long overshadowed by India which has itself been eclipsed by Vietnam.
Looking at the photo at the top of the page you can see the true fruit, 
shaped like a cashew nut, with a false fruit, the "cashew apple" above 
it.</p>
<p>Cashews are never shipped "in the shell" because the "shell" is laced 
with blistering levels of the irritant urushiol. Cashews must be shelled 
and prepared with great care to prevent toxicity and injury to workers. 
While rare, there have been cases of mass rash breakouts from cans of nuts 
contaminated with pieces of shell.</p>

<p>The "cashew apple" is edible but used fresh only locally because it is 
highly perishable, starting to ferment within 24 hours. It is used mainly 
to make jams and fermented and distilled into alcoholic beverages.	There 
is also an Australian cashew, <i>Semecarpus australiensis</i> with a 
similar structure and requiring similar care in handling, but it has 
a very small apple and lacks the "cashew curve".

<h2>Mangos</h2>

<img src="img/cw_mangmix11h.jpg" alt="Mix of Mango Fruits" class=mrg></a>
[<i>A. Mangifera indica</i> | <i>Mangifera sylvatica</i>]
<p>
Native to India and Southeast Asia mangos have been cultivated since 
prehistory. Over 1000 varieties are recognized and hundreds are cultivated 
in India where the fruit is a national obsession. We see just a few varieties 
here in California. Mangos ripen from June to November depending on variety 
and where they are grown, earlier inland later on the coast.</p>
<p>India is by far the largest grower of mangos followed by Southeast Asia, 
but most sold in the U.S. are grown in Mexico. Florida production was 
largely wiped out by hurricane Andrew (1992) and has not been restored 
due to doubts Florida could be price competitive (and fear of more 
hurricanes). Significant production began around 2002 in Southern 
California, but production can not yet meet demand (2013), even at a 
premium price.</p>
<p>While all mangoes sold in North America are <i>M. indica</i>, the 
Pickling Mango <i>M. sylvatica</i> also figures in India and Southeast 
Asia. All the other species are too toxic to be exploited. We now have 
a separate page for Mangos, including <a href="cw_mangz.html"><b>

   Jobo indio (Venezuela), caja-manga, cajarana (Brazil); 
   <i>Spondias dulcis</i> syn <i>Spondias Cytherea</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Melanesia and Polynesia, this fruit is now heavily planted 
   in the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. The flesh is crisp and slightly 
   tart, surrounding a fibrous seed. Due to the seed, they cannot be 
   easily sliced or pitted, so are often eaten out of hand. In Indonesia 
   and Malaysia they would be accompanied by a little shrimp paste. They 
   are also pickled, cooked for preserves, juiced, and used in sauces, 
   soups and stews.

   <p>
   This tree is native to the tropical Americas, but now found in the 
   tropics worldwide. It seldom cultivated but picked wild. The fruit 
   flesh is eaten fresh or used for juice and jelly. In Thailand young 
   leaves (Bai Makok), which have a slightly sour-bitter taste, are eaten 
   raw with <i>nam phrik</i>, a chili condiment variously made. The 
   fruits are used in green papaya salads in Thailand and Laos.

   [Ciruela Roja, Ciruela Huesito, Red Mombin, Purple Mombin, Sineguela,

   <p>
   This small to medium size tree is native to the tropical Americas, and 
   now cultivated in the tropics worldwide for its fruits. Cultivars are 
   being selected for fruit quality and yield to improve the crop. The 
   fruit is like a tiny, round mango, sweet when ripe, very tart when 
   not yet ripe. Unlike the mango, the skin is often eaten with the 
   fruit.</p>
   <p>While they are most commonly eaten ripe, either fresh or 
   simmered in a syrup, they are also eaten not quite ripe with salt 
   and lime juice. The photo specimens, previously frozen, were about 
   1.6 inches long and 1.4 inches diameter, the largest weighing about 
   1 ounce. They were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in 
   Los Angeles, 2012 US $2.85 / pound, bagged in the freezer section.

   <br><img src="img/cw_umbu01h.jpg" alt="Whole green Umbu Fruit" class=mrg>
   [Brazil plum; Imbu (Portuguese); <i>Spondias tuberosa</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Bahia state in northeastern Brazil, this is an important 
   fruit in dry regions because of its high yield and drought resistance. 
   The spherical fruit, which can range from 1 inch to 2 inches diameter, 
   may be light green to light yellow when ripe. The flesh is soft, 
   juicy and sweet, often mixed with other fruits and and used in fruit 
   juices, jams and sorbets. It has to be harvested by hand because it 
   is quite delicate.

<h3>[Genus <i>Schinus</i>]</h3> &nbsp; These trees are in no way related 
to the plants that give us black, white, green, red or Sichuan 
peppercorns. They provide instead the <a href="cw_pprpz.html">
<b>Pink Peppercorns</b></a> that were so popular with the fancy chef set 
some years back. There has been much talk of pink peppercorns grown in 
Florida causing throat irritation, but in general there is almost no 
irritant in dried berries.<p></p>

   [Florida Holly, Christmasberry, <i>Schinus terebinthifolius</i>]
   <p>
   Fruits of this tree are used in the Caribbean for both seasoning and 
   medicinal purposes. "Pink peppercorns" from trees growing in Florida were 
   reputed to cause an allergic reaction in some people (throat irritation) 
   so the chefs get their berries from the Caribbean island of R&eacute;union. 
   Whether this is a real problem or just a move to protect a cash crop on 
   R&eacute;union I do not know, but I've had no problem with the ones from 
   my trees here in California.</p>
   <p>This low growing tree is extremely invasive in wet climates and almost 
   impossible to eradicate, particularly a problem in Hawaii and Florida. 
   It can be told from the California / Peruvian pepper tree by the rounded 
   tips of its leaves and it's low, dense, even sprawling growth habit. Note 
   in the photo new spring growth with the berries on the previous year's 
   growth. <a href="cw_pprpz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

   <p>[Peruvian Mastic tree, <i>Schinus molle</i>]
   </p><p>
   This tree is very common in Southern California and is easy to tell from 
   the Brazilian Pepper Tree. It grows as a large tree with drooping branches 
   bearing very long leaves with many narrow sharply pointed leaflets. The 
   Inca used the berries to make fermented beverages and flavoring syrups. 
   The tree is also used as a medicinal, but is toxic to some animals and 
   possibly small children.  I get these leaves and berries from the Bank 
   of America parking lot down on the corner, but find the berries of my 
   Brazilian pepper trees to be much sweeter and milder. This tree is 
   drought resistant and is a serious invasive in South Africa and Australia.

   <p>Pistachios used to come from Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey. Today 
   I see some Turkish in markets serving Mid Eastern communities, but 
   Iranian aren't much available due to embargos. Afghanistan seems to 
   have found opium more profitable.</p>
   <p>California has taken up the slack. After testing 13 varieties, Kerman 
   and Lassen were chosen for nut bearing female trees and Peters as a male 
   pollen producer. Kerman and Lassen produce particularly large crisp nuts. 
   The first harvest was in 1976 and California is now the second largest 
   producer in the world at 400 million pounds.</p>
   <p>Some have been saying Iranian nuts are better, but we can't know 
   as Trump has renewed conflict with Iran. Iran does grow more varieties 
   (<a href="cw_cashew.html#c01">C1</a>). The Turkish I've found are good but often 
   over-roasted. The photo specimens are all Californian. To the right

   medicinal. Production is very labor intensive, so mastic resin is 
   quite expensive. Nearly all is produced on the Greek island of Chios, 
   where production has been somewhat reduced by a forest fire in 2012. 
   Some has always been produced on the Turkish peninsula of 
   &Ccedil;e&ccedil;me, just a few miles from Chios, and production
