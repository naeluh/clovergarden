<h1>Cashews</h1>
<br><img src="img/cw_cashew3d.jpg" alt="Cashews on the Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Anacardium occidentale</i>]
<p>
The Cashew is native to Brazil, which is still a major grower, though 
long overshadowed by India which has itself been eclipsed by Vietnam, 
with Ivory Coast and other parts of Africa catching up. Looking at the 
photo to the left you can see the true fruit, shaped like a cashew nut, 
with a false fruit, the "cashew apple" above it.</p>
<p>Cashews are never shipped "in the shell" because the "shell", the 
fruit wall, is laced with dangerous levels of the irritant urushiol. 
Cashews must be shelled and prepared with great care to prevent toxicity. 
While rare, there have been cases where cans of nuts contaminated with 
pieces of shell have caused mass rash breakouts.</p>
<p>The "cashew apple" is edible but used fresh mostly locally because it 
is tender and highly perishable, starting to ferment within 24 hours. 
It is used mainly to make jams, juice, or fermented and distilled into 
alcoholic beverages.

<p>There is also an Australian cashew, <i>Semecarpus australiensis</i> 
with a similar structure and requiring similar care in handling, but it 
has a very small apple and lacks the "cashew curve". It is used mainly 
as "bush food" by the Australian aborigines, who handle it with great 
care and mud coated hands.</p>

<h2>Cashew Nuts</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cw_cashew06d.jpg" alt="Cashew Nuts" class=mrg>
Actually seeds, Cashews are 
familiar to Americans roasted, salted and often mixed in with nuts. 
Despite their Brazilian origin, cashews are much used in Asian cooking. 
In India they are most often ground as a thickener, but sometimes used 
as a feature ingredient. In Southeast Asia, they are often used whole 
in various dishes. For cooking you generally want to use the "raw" 
version. They are often dry pan roasted until spotted brown and the 
flavor has changed, but these are very different in taste and texture 
from the heavily oven roasted snack nuts. Of course, they are similarly 
used in Brazil, but the "apple" has traditionally been more used there.

<p>Because heat, usually roasting, is generally used to safely remove the 
cashew from its shell without injury or toxic contamination, "raw" usually 
means "not roasted after shelling". I understand there is a company in 
Indonesia with special equipment that can extract cashews safely without 
heat for sale to people following a strict raw foods diet - at a premium 
price, of course.

<h2>Cashew Apples</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_cashewa02f.jpg" alt="Cashew Apples with Nuts" class=mrg>
[Mara&ntilde;on (Spanish)]
<p>The "Apple" is an "Accessory Fruit" (formerly "False Fruit). The true 
fruit is the multi-layered "shell" surrounding the nut, and the "apple" 
is a swollen flower stem (pedicel). The tree's strategy is that animals 
will carry off the fruit to new locations, but will avoid biting 
into the actual fruit surrounding the seed. These "apples" are very 
tender, so not often sent far from the growing region, where they may 
be used in many ways.</p>
<p>I purchased the photo specimens, frozen, from a large market in 
Los Angeles (Burbank) serving South and Central American and Mexican 
communities. The largest was 4-1/8 inches long (not counting the nut) 
and 2 inches diameter at the large end, weighing 6-1/4 ounces. The 
flesh was very tasty, but too fibrous to eat, so, juice.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cashew Apple Juice</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_cashewa04c.jpg" alt="Cashew Apple Juice in Glass" class=mrg>
<p>When examining the Cashew 
Apples in the photo above, I found the flesh far too fibrous for eating, 
so I chopped them up and squeezed them for juice. The juice was very 
pleasant, kind of like a mix of mango and peach, and needed no 
sweetening. 14 ounces of fruit yielded 6 ounces of juice (43%), but it 
could have been more because some was lost messing around studying 
the fruit, and I could have chopped it finer and pressed it harder.</p>
<p>Where cashews are harvested, this juice is often fermented, then 
single distilled to about 15% alcohol, or double distilled to over 
40% alcohol. In Brazil, unfermented cashew juice is used for a very 
popular mixed drink called Caju Amigo (Cashew Friend). It's 50% Cashew 
Juice and 50% Cacha&ccedil;a (Brazilian rum, 48% alcohol). Ice is 
sometimes added. This is also done by chewing a slice of Cashew Apple, 
then swallowing the juice (only) with a sip of Cacha&ccedil;a. Cashew 
Apple Juice can often be found in markets serving a community from the 
American tropics.

<h2>Cashew Nut Shells</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_cashewa05h.jpg" alt="Cashew Nut in Shell" class=mrg>
You probably don't want to 
mess with these. The shell is very tough, and, between the inner 
and outer layers it is full of extremely flammable oils laced with 
dangerous quantities of urushiol, the irritant found in poison ivy.
They are roasted over flame, and the oils ignite into a raging blaze, 
which must be put out in 10 minutes or the cashew seeds will burn. 
Most, but not all the urushiol will have been destroyed.
<p>In Vietnam, India and Africa, people employed in shelling cashews 
often suffer seriously from these oils. The oils do have many important 
industrial applications and some byproducts are used in frictional 
applications like brake pads. Leave these to the industries for which 
they have value.

<h2>Cashew Sprouts</h2> 
<br><img src="img/cw_cashews01d.jpg" alt="Cashew Sprouts" class=mrg>
You are unlikely to find these 
sprouts in your local natural foods store. In tropical India, 
particularly the state of Karala, they are gathered from the ground after 
the monsoon rains, or from late dropping fruits at the end of harvest 
time. They are not usually marketed, but used in the homes of the 
gatherers. They can be eaten raw, but are often used as an ingredient 
in curries, where they are said to taste similar to mushrooms.
