[Chirauli-nut, Chironji, Chiraunji, Saaraparuppu; <i>Buchanania lanzan</i> 
| <i>B. latifolia</i>]
<p>
   <i>B. lanza</i> is native to India and Malaysia, while 
   <i>B. latifolia</i> has a wider range, extending into China and Laos. 
   Seeds of this shrub look much like pine nuts, and have a similar hard 
   shell. Once broken out of their shells they have about the same size 
   and soft consistency as pine nuts, but a flavor compared to almonds 
   or hazelnuts. They are generally lightly toasted before use, which 
   is often in sweets. They are also ground for use as a spice, flavoring 
   and thickener in savory sauces, curries and kormas. &nbsp;

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; These are rather difficult to find in North 
America, so substitues will need to be used most of the time. For sauces, 
I use lightly toasted raw cashews (related and reasonably soft), though 
raw almonds could be used similarly. Some suggest pine nuts, similar in 
size and consistency but much more resinous. Instead, I'd choose raw 
pistachios (related, and less resinous).<p></p>
