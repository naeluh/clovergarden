<h1>June Plum</h1>

[Ambarella, Tahitian Apple, Otaheite Apple, Golden Apple; Vi (Hawaii, 
Tonga); Makok farang (Thai); 
Cay coc (Viet); Kedondong, Ambar (Indonesia, Malaysia); June Plum, 
Pomme cythere, Manzana de oro (Caribbean); Ambarella (Sri Lanka, Dutch);

<p>
Native to Melanesia and Polynesia, this fruit is now heavily planted in 
the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. The flesh is crisp and slightly tart, 
surrounding a fibrous seed. Due to the seed, they cannot be easily sliced 
or pitted, so are often eaten out of hand. In Indonesia and Malaysia they 
would be accompanied by a little shrimp paste. They are also pickled, 
cooked for preserves, juiced, and used in sauces, soups and stews.</p>

<h2>Green June Plums</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_junep04d.jpg" alt="Green June Plums, whole and cut" class=mrg>
This is the state of ripeness 
in which I usually find these fruits. They fall while still green and 
ripen on the ground. The photo specimens were about 1.8 inches long and 
1.2 inches diameter, weighing about 0.9 ounces each, though they are 
often up to 3-1/2 inches long. In their native Pacific Islands they are 
reported to be much larger and weigh up to 1 pound. These were purchased 
in November from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2016 US $3.99 / pound. &nbsp; <b>Subst:</b> Unripe mango.
<p>In Indonesia, these fruits are sought out by pregnant women because 
they are reputed to reduce related feelings of sickness. They can be 
peeled if the skin is a bit grungy, or you wish to reduce tartness. They 
are often impaled on a bamboo skewer for convenience of dipping in soy 
sauce, fish sauce, shrimp sauce, or a mix of salt and chili powder. 
Chutneys are made from this fruit in Sri Lanka and Jamaica, and in 
Sri Lanka they are used to make curries with spices and coconut 
milk.</p>
<p>These fruits are a very common ingredient in the famous Malaysian 
and Singaporean Rojak fruit salads. They are also often juiced to make 
a very pleasant iced beverage. Stewed with a little water and sugar, 
then pressed through a sieve, they make a condiment very similar to 
apple sauce, but with more flavor.

<h2>Ripe June Plums</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_junep08d.jpg" alt="Ripe June Plums, whole and cut" class=mrg>
These ripe June Plums, purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) in May, are unusual because this market usually has them 
only in dark green. They were typically 1.8 inch long by 1.2 inches 
diameter, weighing about 0.8 ounces each, 2017 US $3.99 / pound. These 
were sweeter than the green and quite good for eating out of hand. If 
green ones are in good condition, they can be left on a counter at room 
temperature to ripen.

<h2>Pickled Ambarella</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_junep02d.jpg" alt="Pickled Ambarellas, whole and cut" class=mrg>
This form of June Plum is more consistently available than the fresh here 
in Los Angeles. The photo specimens, from Vietnam, were up to 2.5 inches 
by 1.95 inches, peeled and pickled "sweet and sour". The firm crisp 
flesh was slashed in places to allow penetration of the pickle. They 
appeared to have been picked while still somewhat green, and were 
slightly sour with an interesting slightly mango-like flavor. I have 
also purchased much smaller ones in which the seeds were so small and 
soft they could be eaten along with the flesh. Ingred: Spondias dulcis 
fruit, chili, sugar, salt, vinegar, water, potassium sorbate, FD&amp;C 
yellow #6.

<h2>Ma-kok, Preserved</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_makok02d.jpg" alt="Preserved Ma-kok (June Plum), whole and cut" class=mrg>
These June plums were dried, but still moist, shrink wrapped as a snack 
food. They had a sweet-sour flavor and contained some inedible fibers. 
The photo specimens were 1.9 inches long by 1.4 inches across, weighing 
1-1/4 ounce each. Ing: Ma-kok, sugar, salt, water, citric acid, chili 
powder, FD&amp;C yellow #5, FD&amp;C blue #1, sodium benzoate, sodium 
metabisulfites as preservative. they were purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel).

<h2>June Plum Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/cw_junep10d.jpg" alt="June Plum Leaves" class=mrg>
June plum leaves are edible. In Indonesia, young tender leaves are used 
as a seasoning in preparations cooked wrapped in banana leaves, and are 
steamed as a vegetable accompaniment for salted fish and rice. In 
Thailand, tender leaves are also eaten as a vegetable. In Costa Rica, 
more mature leaves are used in salads, though they are fairly tart.

<h2>Health and Nutrition</h2>

<p>June plums have almost no fat, but also almost no protein. Their 
main nutritional contributions (per 100 grams) are 12 grams 
carbohydrates, calcium (5.7% RDI), phosphorous (6.7% RDI), and 
vitamin A (4.1% RDI).</p>

<p>June Plum fruit and leaf extracts are reported to offer significant 
antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Cytotoxicity (used in cancer 
treatment) and thrombolytic properties (dissolving blood clots) are 
also reported.</p>
