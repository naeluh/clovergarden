<h1>Mangos</h1>
<br><img src="img/cw_mangmix11e.jpg" alt="Mixed Mangos" class=mrg>
[<i>Mangifera indica</i>]
<p>
Native to India and Southeast Asia, mangos have been cultivated since 
prehistory. Over 1000 varieties are recognized and hundreds are cultivated 
in India where the fruit is a national obsession. We see just a few 
varieties here in California. Mangos ripen from June to November 
depending on variety and where they are grown, earlier inland later on 
the coast.</p>
<p>India is by far the largest grower of mangos followed by Southeast Asia, 
but most sold in the U.S. are grown in Mexico. Florida production was 
largely wiped out by hurricane Andrew (1992) and has not been restored 
due to doubts Florida could be price competitive, and fear of more 
hurricanes. Significant production began in Southern 
California around 2002, but production cannot yet meet demand (2013), 
even at a premium price.</p>
<p>While all mangoes sold in North America are <i>M. indica</i>, the 
Pickling Mango <i>M. sylvatica</i> also figures in India and Southeast 
Asia. All the other species are too toxic to be exploited.</p>

<p>In the US, Mangos are designated by color and size (how many per box). 
Sizes for Yellow: Small #4312 (18 and smaller), Large #4961 (16 and 
larger). Sizes for Green: Small #4311 (12 and smaller), Large #4584 (8 
to 10), XL #3114 (7 and larger). Sizes for Red: Small #4051 (12 and 
smaller), Large #4959 (8 to 10), XL #3488 (7 and larger).</p>

<h3>Buying</h3>: &nbsp; Color depends on variety and isn't a good guide 
to ripeness, though colored varieties shouldn't be picked until they show 
good color. The biggest point in selection is uniformity. A mango should 
be the same degree of hardness over its entire surface - no softer spots. 
If you're in a hurry for a ripe one look for one where the flesh gives a 
little when lightly pressed. To be honest, fully ripe ones are very rare 
in markets, and may be damaged from handling. Best to buy ahead of need. 
Select mangos that show good color for their variety, with very little 
or no give at all.<p></p>
<h3>Ripening:</h3> &nbsp;  Mangos ripen best at room temperature in a 
tray, stem end down, or just out on the counter. Some say to cover them 
with a slightly damp towel to prevent wrinkling, but I don't bother with 
the towel because I haven't found slight wrinkling to be a problem. In 
fact, with Kents and Haydens, its a good sign of ripeness. They are ready 
to eat when the flesh yields similar to a ripe peach and before they 
start to get any brownish areas. Once ripe, you have a couple of days 
window in which to eat them. Mangos should not be stored below 
50&deg;F/10&deg;C.<p></p>

   <h2>Keitt</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mgkeit02e.jpg" alt="Large whole and cut Green Keitt Mango Fruit" class=mrg>
   [#3114 green mango XL; var. Keitt]
   <p>Southern California began significant mango cultivation in the 
   Coachella Valley around 2002, a little less than half the production 
   being certified organic. The variety grown is Keitt, a large India 
   type fruit running from 20 to over 30 ounces. The record for all 
   mangos is a Keitt grown in the Philippines, measuring 12 inches long,  
   7 inches wide, and weighing 7.57 pounds.
   <p>The fruit remains mostly green when ripe, and for marketing they 
   may be treated with ethylene gas to improve color. Flavor is excellent 
   and there is almost no fiber, just a bit around the seed. Production 
   is finally catching up to demand (Sept. 2018) and I purchased them in 
   one of the multi-ethnic markets in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US 
   $1.29 each. The photo specimen was 6-3/4 inches long, 4-1/4 inches 
   diameter and weighed 30-3/8 ounces. The black spots on the uncut one 
   indicate it is in an "eat now" state of ripeness.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Ataulfo</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangata02h.jpg" alt="Whole Ataulfo Mango" class=mrg>
   [#4961 Adaulfo, Adolfo, Champagne]
   <p>
   This is a Philippine type mango developed in Chiapas, in the far 
   south of Mexico. It is a hybrid of the Manilla Mango but maintains 
   its Philippine characteristics. It is reputed to be among the 
   sweetest mangos in the world, and has smooth flesh with no fiber. 
   The photo specimens were purchased in late May from a very large 
   Vietnamese / Chinese market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for a sale 
   price of 2019 US $1.00 each. The photo specimen was 4-1/4 x 3 x 2.5 
   inches and weighed 10-5/8 ounces, at the high end for this variety. 
   A 9-3/4 ounce yielded 7-3/8 ounces edible (76%).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Manila Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangmanilla02h.jpg" alt="Small yellow Manila Mango fruit" class=mrg>
   [#4312 &nbsp; | &nbsp; also Manilita, which is similar but red]
   <p>
   Developed and grown in Veracruz, Mexico this mango was brought from 
   the Philippines over 200 years ago. Mexico and the Philippines are 
   now fighting over the "Manila" name. This mango is flat, elongated 
   and yellow and quite small. It is available most of the year, but 
   costs less at its peak season. These are highly regarded for flavor 
   and juiciness. A few are grown in Southern California and show up at 
   certified farmer's markets.  Examples recently purchased at a large 
   multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) were 2019 US $0.50 
   each, but they can be much higher at other stores. They were typically 
   4-1/8 x 2-1/2 x 2-1/8 inches and weighed 7-1/2 ounces, near the high 
   end for the type.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Mexican Baby Mango</h2> 
   <br><img src="img/cw_mgmexb02h.jpg" alt="Tiny yellow Mexican mango fruit" class=mrg>
   <p>
   These mangos, ranging from 1-1/3 inches to 3 inches long, are clearly 
   of the same type as the Manilla Mango, but all had very thin, flat, 
   apparently non-viable seeds. They were purchased from an Asian market 
   in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) at 2016 US $2.99 / pound. Flavor was 
   excellent, very sweet with just the right note of resin, and with 
   such thin seeds yield was good. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Thai Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangthai02e.jpg" alt="Green Thai Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [#4312 (any small Yellow Mango)]
   <p>
   These mangos, just over 5 inches long, were green and quite hard. The 
   yellow-green flesh was crunchy, but already there was moderate 
   sweetness. They were pleasant to eat, but might be a little too sweet 
   for most green mango recipes. I first noticed these in a large Asian 
   market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) in early June, 2017. Typically 
   5-1/8 inch long by 3-1/3 inches wide and 2 inches thick, weighing 
   7-1/4 ounces. The skin is very thin and easily peeled with a vegetable 
   peeler. A 7-1/4 ounce fruit weighed 6-1/8 ounces peeled. The seed 
   weighed 1 ounce, so 5-1/8 ounces were edible, a yield of 71%. 2017 
   US $2.99 / pound.  
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Thai Yellow Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangty02e.jpg" alt="Ripe Thai Yellow Mangoes, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Xo&aacute;i Hoa Loc]
   <p>
   These mangos are fairly sweet and definitely for eating. They are ripe 
   when the flesh gives a little, similar to Mexican mangos. They are 
   very sweet and quite aromatic, with a pleasant, lightly resinous 
   flavor. When ripe, they are still firm enough to peel with a sharp 
   swivel vegetable peeler. They have very little fiber, mostly at the 
   edges of the seeds. A 15-1/4 ounce mango, skinned and seeded, yielded 
   11-1/8 ounces edible (73%).</p>
   <p>The uncut photo specimen was 5-1/4 inches long, 3-1/4 inches wide 
   and 3 inches thick, weighing exactly 1 pound. It was purchased 
   in late May from a large Vietnamese / Chinese market in Los Angeles (San 
   Gabriel) for 2019 US $5.99 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Thai Large Green Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangtg02e.jpg" alt="Large Thai Green Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Xo&aacute;i Tw&oacute;ng (Viet)]
   <p>When I was buying these mangos, two Vietnamese ladies independently 
   informed me that they are eaten when still hard. While still 
   reasonably hard, the two photo specimens were too soft inside to grate 
   for green papaya recipes, so they are definitely for eating. Cut 
   pieces are moderately crisp, lightly sweet, and with an interesting 
   touch of resin in the flavor. They would go well as cubes in a fruit 
   salad, especially to temper overly sweet fruits. These were firm 
   enough to be peeled with a regular swivel vegetable peeler, and could 
   be cut however you like, even into thin slices. They had very little 
   fiber near the seed.</p>
   <p>A 26-3/4 ounce fruit yielded 19 ounces edible (71%). The seed is 
   fairly thin, but there is likely to be some hard, discolored flesh 
   at the stem end. The uncut photo specimen was 8 inches long, 3-3/4 
   inches wide and 3-1/4 inches thick, weighing 1 pound 12-3/4 ounces. 
   It was purchased in late May from a large Vietnamese / Chinese market 
   in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $3.99 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Green Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_manggrn03h.jpg" alt="Unripe Mango Fruit" class=mrg>
   [<i>A. Mangifera indica</i>]
   <p>
   These mangos, used in Asian cuisines, must be truly unripe, with 
   bright white, hard and sour flesh. Just a hard green regular mango 
   will not work. They are julienned or grated and used in salads all 
   over Southeast Asia. In India they are used to make chutneys. Asian 
   markets carry green mangos at a significantly higher price than for 
   almost ripe ones. The photo specimen was 5-1/2 inches long, 3-1/2 
   inches across and weighed 1 pound 4-1/4 ounces. It was purchased for 
   2017 US $1.99 / pound from a very large Asian market in Los Angeles 
   (San Gabriel), but many markets here ask up to $2.99 / pound. Since 
   I'm not Asian I used to be often asked at checkout whether a green 
   mango was really what I want. Today they just figure a white person 
   buying a green mango knows what s/he's doing - or deserves what 
   they're going to get. These mangos are too immature to ripen on the 
   counter.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Green Mango, Florida</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangfb01e.jpg" alt="Green Florida Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   These green mangos were very small. The largest was 2.8 inches long, 
   1.9 inches across and 1.6 inches thick, weighing 2-3/4 ounces. Though 
   very young, they had definite mango flavor and some sweetness. The 
   seeds were soft enough to eat, but rather bitter. I found them in 
   a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) in mid June,for 
   2017 US $2.99 / pound.  
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2>Green Mango, Guatemalan</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_manggg02e.jpg" alt="Guatemalan Green Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   <p>These were formerly frozen. They were picked very young, with seeds 
   so soft the knife passed right through them without resistance. They 
   had a very light mango flavor, but were not as tart as you might 
   expect from mangos so young. They were 2.6 inches long by 1.8 
   inches across and 1.5 inches thick, weighing 2.0 ounces each. They 
   were purchased frozen and vacuum packed from a large Latino market 
   in Los Angeles (Burbank) which serves Mexican, Central and South 
   American communities.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Red Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mgokent03e.jpg" alt="Red Kent Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [#4051 (sm) #4959 (lg), mostly var. Kent, Hayden but also includes 
   Palmer, Vandyke, Edwared, and Tommy Atkins]
   <p>
   India type mangos grown in Mexico. These are the standard mango sold 
   in Southern California. Plump ovate, green yellow with red shoulders. 
   Kent is 20 to 26 ounces and ripens late mid-season. Hayden is up to 24 
   ounces and ripens early. Both have good flavor and little or no fiber.
   These are always sold a bit under-ripe for shipping durability and 
   need to be left out on a counter until the flesh yields to gentle 
   thumb pressure.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Giant Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangg02e.jpg" alt="Giant Mangos, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [#3488 XL]
   <p>I don't know much about this mango yet, but its size is quite 
   unusual. The photo specimens were 6-1/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches 
   diameter and weighted 2 pounds 10 ounces. They were quite meaty, and 
   the flavor was excellent with fiber free flesh. They were purchased 
   from a large market in Los Angeles that specializes in products and 
   produce for Mexican and Central American communities. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Tommy Atkins</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangota01h.jpg" alt="Red Mangos on Tree" class=mrg>
   [#4051 (sm) #4959 (lg), var. Tommy Atkins]
   <p>
   A medium size Red Mango to 16 ounces grown in Florida, Central 
   and South America, the Caribbean and Israel, mainly for export. It 
   originated in Florida from a Hayden seed and now dominates what little 
   production is left in Florida. It's most outstanding feature is it can 
   be picked immature for shipment and ripens fairly well in transit. It's 
   least desirable features are a lot of fibers in the flesh and a 
   relatively bland flavor. Most mangos found in England and Europe are 
   of this variety, and I expect so are those above 40&deg; North in 
   North America. Ovate, colorfully orange-yellow and red with a purple 
   bloom, it is firm, juicy, somewhat fibrous and flavor ranges from 
   fair to good, but poor if over fertilized or over irrigated. &nbsp;

   [Amchur, Green Mango]
   <p>
   This is dried and powdered unripe Mango (Amchoor powder), but also sold 
   as dried slices. It is a very important souring agent in the drier and 
   more northern areas of India where lemons and limes are expensive and 
   quickly rot. As a powder it is light weight and lasts a long time.

   <h2>Mango Leaf</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_manglf02h.jpg" alt="Mango Leaves" class=mrg>
   [<i>A. Mangifera indica</i>]
   <p>
   Mango leaves are rather toxic and can cause severe contact 
   dermatitis in susceptible people, similar to that of the related 
   poison ivy. These leaves are much used in Hindu ritual, and extracts 
   may have serious medicinal uses which are beyond the scope of this 
   page. Despite the toxicity, I have found recipes using them, but the 
   leaves used are immature, in a stage when they are pink-yellow in 
   color, and presumably not yet seriously toxic.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Pickling Mango</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cw_mangsylv01c.jpg" alt="Plant drawing of pickling mango" class=mrg>
   [<i>A. Mangifera sylvatica</i>]
   <p>
   This is the only commonly used mango that is not of the <i>indica</i> 
   species, all the rest being too toxic. This one won't be found in North 
   America, except as an ingredient in imported chutneys and the like. It 
   is native to India, Nepal and throughout Southeast Asia. &nbsp;
