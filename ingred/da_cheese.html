<h1>Cheese</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Cheese was probably invented somewhere in Western Asia or 
Southeastern Europe where herding tribes had domesticated milk producing 
animals. Someone probably stored milk using the stomach of a young calf 
or goat as a container and found it had curdled - but was still quite 
edible. By squeezing out the liquid, milk could now be made more 
transportable and it lasted longer. By adding salt it could be 
preserved for some time.</span>

<h3>Cheddar</h3>
<br>Technically, "cheddaring" is the process of pressing the curds 
and standing them for a few minutes to a couple hours after separating 
from the whey. This develops a desired texture. Although many cheeses 
are "cheddared", in trade the name is applied to certain aged cheeses 
resembling those originally made in England. Cheddaring develops a 
fibrous texture, but "Cheddar" cheeses are ground after cheddaring to 
make them smooth.
<p>"Cheddar" cheeses are now made in many countries, in a very wide 
range of versions and an even wider range of quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Natural Cheddar:</b> &nbsp; These cheeses are made by traditional 
  processes and properly aged. They are generally dense, firm, and tangy. 
  They may be in "Mild", "Medium",  "Sharp" and "Extra Sharp" versions, 
  the designation depending on aging. The longer the age, the sharper 
  the flavor and the firmer and more crumbly the texture. Natural 
  cheddar melts well and is smooth and not rubbery when melted. It can 
  be white to orange depending on how much annatto is added for color.
  <p></p></li>
<li><b>Industrial Cheddar:</b> This is a product of large factories 
  and resembles real cheese - to an extent. It is almost always a "mild" 
  grade. It melts into a rubbery mess, making it totally unsuitable 
  for uses like Welsh Rabbit. For this reason it is usually grated before 
  adding to anything that will be cooked. Ingredients are often various 
  milk extractions with chemical stabilizers and artificial color.</li>
  </ul>  
 
<h3>Fresh Cheese</h3>
<br>Generically, any freshly made unsalted or very lightly salted, 
unaged whole milk or part skim milk cheese. These are made in every 
region where cheese is made, often in households or on farms, but also 
in factories, particularly here in Southern California where the demand 
is very high and safety controls are very tight.
<p>Fresh cheeses are subject to rapid spoiling (5 days or so 
refrigerated) and can easily become contaminated with pathogens if due 
care is not taken. These cheeses are predominantly soft, but can be 
firm, and are white unless dyed.</p>


<h3>Goat Cheese</h3>
<br>Goat cheese is a generic term for a fresh white cheese made from the 
milk of goats. American goat cheese tends to be made up into logs about 
1-1/2 inches diameter and can be quite soft while Greek goat cheese is 
often firmer and made up into blocks or packed in plastic tubs.
Goat cheese becomes very soft when heated but does not become runny.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="make">How Cheese is Made</h2>

<p>The full process listed here would be for an aged and ripened cheese. 
The process is varied for different types of cheeses and some cheeses 
don't go through all the steps, particularly fresh cheeses will not be 
aged and loose cheeses will not be pressed.</p>
<ol>
<li>First you milk your beast - cow, goat, sheep, buffalo, camel or 
whatever. The milk may be used as is, or it may be skimmed, or enhanced 
with extra cream, or you may pasteurize it, even homogenize it, depending 
on the cheese you are making. Some, like Swiss, can't be made from 
pasteurized milk and some soft cheeses just don't taste the same if not 
made from raw milk.</li>
<li>You warm the milk and add a starter bacteria culture to increase the 
acidity of the milk so it will curdle properly.</li>
<li>At a particular point you add a curdling agent. For simple farmhouse 
cheeses like <a href="da_cheesev.html#paneer">Paneer</a> or some recipes 
for Farmer Cheese, lemon juice is both acidifier and does the curdling, 
no starter being used. More elaborate cheeses will use rennet (extracted 
from the fourth stomach of a suckling calf (some disassembly required)) 
or now more commonly produced by genetically engineered bacteria 
(vegetable - microbial rennet) in large factory vats. Other curdling 
agents are also used.</li>
<li>You cut the congealed mass with a long knife to allow the whey (watery 
part) to drain off the curds (gel part).</li>
<li>The curds are gently cooked to further coagulate them and make them 
more firm. Most cheeses are cooked in the whey, but for "washed curd" 
cheeses like colby the whey is replaced with water to produce a milder 
cheese.</li>
<li id="cheddared">The curds are then "cheddared" for a few minutes 
to a couple of hours by piling them up in a mass. The weight produces a 
fibrous texture. Some milder cheeses like Colby are not cheddared.</li>
<li>You then "mill" the cheese which may be stretching and kneading to 
enhance the fibrousness (<a href="da_cheesev.html#mozz">Mozzarella</a>), 
or grind it up to make it smooth 
(<a href="da_cheesev.html#chedb">Cheddar</a>).</li>
<li>The cheese is then salted and pressed to remove the last of the whey 
and slow further fermentation.</li>
<li>You can now age the cheese and further develop it with special molds 
(blue cheeses) or bacteria. "Fresh" cheeses are not aged and some are 
pickled in brine (Feta, Nabulsi).</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="region">Major Cheese Making Regions</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Anatolia &amp; Caucasus</h3> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#eac"><h3>Armenia</h3></a> doesn't 
  need to export a lot of cheese to the U.S. because tons of Armenian 
  cheeses are made every day here in California. Georgian cheeses are 
  also made here.<p></p></li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#eac"><h3>Turkey</h3></a> is a 
  major cheese producer and exporter, particularly of white goat and 
  sheep cheeses preserved with salt or brine. Semi-hard cheeses are also 
  made and some foreign style cheeses for export. Many other types are 
  made all over Turkey, but these are the major varieties.
  </li>
  </ul>

<p></p>
<h3>North America</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#na"><h3>California</h3></a> 
    is the second largest cheese producer in North America but is first 
    in producing many ethnic cheeses to satisfy our diverse population. 
    California is also a hotbed of artisanal cheese makers producing 
    very high quality products - and has plenty of yuppies to buy them.
    </li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#mex"><h3>Mexico / California</h3></a>. 
    Mexican cooking uses a lot of cheese, and Mexican cheeses 
    are unique, so California churns out Mexican cheeses in vast tonnage 
    to satisfy our large Mexican population.</li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#na"><h3>Wisconsin</h3></a> 
    is the largest cheese producer in North America, and guilty of many 
    tons of "industrial" cheeses. Lacking the ethnic diversity of 
    California, they produce fewer types of cheese, but do make some 
    very fine cheddar and hard Italian style cheeses. Some Near Eastern 
    cheeses are also made there.</ul>

<h3>Europe</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#scn"><h3>Scandinavia</h3></a> 
    - famous for Danish Blue cheese and for a feta which can't be called 
    feta anymore due to a lawsuit by Greece. Many other cheeses are 
    made here.</li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#frog"><h3>France</h3></a> - 
    the Mecca of cheese - France produces a bewildering array of cheese 
    types, and many of the highest quality cheeses found anywhere in the 
    world.</li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#se"><h3>Greece, Balkans, Southeast 
    Europe</h3></a> This is the region where cheese was probably 
    invented. It is much known for goat and sheep cheeses.</li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#nl"><h3>Holland</h3></a> became 
    famous hundreds of years ago for excellent cheeses that stood up 
    well to shipment by sailing ships. These cheeses are still popular.
    </li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#it"><h3>Italy</h3></a> makes 
    almost as many different cheeses as France and has a similar attitude 
    regarding quality. Unlike French cheeses, the Italian cheeses are 
    used much more in cooking than on cheese plates.</li>
  <li><a href="da_cheesev.html#sw"><h3>Switzerland</h3></a> 
    is well known for the bubble riddled "Swiss Cheese" (Emmentaler) that 
    is imitated worldwide with various degrees of success, but the 
    country makes a number of other aged cheeses, mostly hard but some 
    soft.</li>
    </ul>

<a href="da_cheesev.html#ind"><h3>India</h3></a> has a long 
dairy tradition in the north, but also has customs forbidding food to 
be held overnight and strictures on using animal rennet for coagulation. 
For these reason the only cheese much used there is Paneer, an acid 
coagulated cheese that can be used the day it is made. Paneer is not 
much used in southern India because the population there is largely 
lactose intolerant. 


<a href="da_cheesev.html#me"><h3>Near &amp; Middle East:</h3></a> 
&nbsp; While not widely known as a cheese producing region, the Near and 
Middle East (and we'll toss in North Africa, including Egypt here too) 
do make some unique cheeses.<p></p>






<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Cheese is very high in protein, and often turned to by Ovo-Lacto 
vegetarians to help them get adequate protein. This is also complete 
protein which needs no supplementation. Cheese, however, is also high 
in fats, so must be used with discretion.</p>

<h3>Lactose Intolerance:</h3> &nbsp; All cheeses contain 
some lactose, a milk sugar, but the amount varies greatly. Lactose 
intolerant people can often eat cheeses that are aged more than three 
months because the lactose is turned into easily digestible lactic acid 
by bacteria.<p></p>

<p>Process cheeses like Velveeta have the most lactose, as much as fresh 
milk, followed by Mexican Queso Fresco and other fresh, unaged cheeses. 
A lactose intolerant person can often build up a tolerance by starting 
with aged cheeses and gradually moving to the less aged.</p>

<h3>Protein Intolerance:</h3> &nbsp; The main protein milk  
contributes to cheese is casein, which is precipitated out in the 
curdling process. This leaves several other proteins still dissolved in 
the whey. These can be used to make some other cheeses, like Ricotta. 
Some people can be allergic to casein, or whey proteins, or both. This 
is called "Dairy Allergies", which is entirely different from Lactose 
Intolerance.<p></p>
