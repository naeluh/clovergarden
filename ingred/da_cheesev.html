<h1>Varieties <small>of</small> Cheese</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Cheese is very sensitive to many factors, including exact temperatures, 
mold and bacterial cultures, what animal the milk came from and what that 
animal's diet was, how much salt was added, exactly how it was processed 
and how long and under what conditions it was aged. This variability has 
resulted in hundreds of unique cheeses being made in all parts of the 
world where dairy animals are available.

<span class=bg>Cheese is totally despised in China - they learned about 
it from Mongol conquerors. They invented instead fermented tofu, which 
they call "rotten milk". Korea and Japan pretty much follow suit. Most 
Asians are lactose intolerant anyway.</span>

<h2 class=lrg id="var">International Varieties <small>of</small> Cheese</h2>

<p>Given many hundreds of different cheeses, we'll not try to list them 
all here. We will concentrate on cheeses widely and affordably available 
in North America (or at least here in Southern California). $20/pound 
gourmet cheeses and cheeses very hard to find in North America will be 
here only if they are particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Most of the cheeses listed here were found in the normal multi-ethnic 
markets that abound here in Los Angeles, not from specialty cheese shops, 
gourmet vendors or on-line, so prices listed may be very low compared to 
those sources.</p>
<p>The fanciest I got was Trader Joe's - nothing here was from Whole Foods 
or other higher end yuppie outlets, but you should easily find most of 
these cheeses at such markets.</p>
<p>Cheeses are listed by region of origin. Cheeses that are now made 
worldwide are listed primarily under the region they originated from.</p>

<hr class=hr4>

<h2 id="afr">Africa</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Evidence of cheese making in Egypt dates from about 5200 years ago.</p>

<h3>Areesh / Karish</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Egypt)
<br>This is a soft cheese made from yogurt which has a flavor similar 
to ricotta. The yogurt is heated slowly until it curdles and separates. 
It is then drained. The product is similar to Leban / Lebneh made in 
the Levant. A major use is in making <a href="da_cheesev.html#shank">Shanklish</a> 
where it is fermented and aged until firm to hard, and Mish, where it 
is fermentd in a pot and remains spreadable.<p></p>

<h3>Istanbolli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Egypt)
<br><img src="img/cz_istamb04h.jpg" alt="Lumps of Istamboli" width="220" height="142" class=mrg>
A soft white spreading cheese with a strong flavor of green peppers but 
no significant amount of heat. It is quite salty so keeps well in the 
refrigerator. Fried, it softens and sags but does not really melt. It 
doesn't get stringy and exudes almost no oil. It's strong green pepper 
flavor makes it unsuitable for most cheese recipes, but it is a good 
spread for bread or crackers. The photo specimen was made in Egypt 
from buffalo milk.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Mish</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Egypt)
<br><img src="img/cz_mish01h.jpg" alt="Small Dish of Mish Cheese" width="220" height="208" class=mrg>
A soft, salty fermented spreading cheese with a strong flavor. It is 
very important to the diet of Egyptian peasants, and something like it 
may have been made there for over 5000 years. It is usually made 
in the home, fermented in a pot, starting with a yogurt cheese like 
Areesh and using a previous batch as a starter.  It is fermented for 
months or years. The jar may be opened often to use the Mish and/or to 
add more of the feedstock cheese. Small worms may develop in the Mish 
but are not considered dangerous.

<h3>Romy</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Roumy, Ras; (Egypt)]
<br><img src="img/cz_romya07h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Romy Cheese"  width="220" height="228" class=mrg>
This is the major hard cheese of Egypt. Romy meant "foreigner", and 
the cheese was so called because it was originally made by the Turks in 
Egypt. In Alexandria it was called Torky. It is a hard salty cheese made 
from whole milk, cow or cow and buffalo, often with whole peppercorns 
added. After aging 3 to 4 months it is ready to be sliced and is a 
popular breakfast cheese in Egypt.
<p>"Medium Aged Romy" is aged for about 3 years and is a good grating 
cheese. "Old Aged Romy" is 8 to 12 years. With age it becomes sharper 
and more crumbly. When fried, Romy softens and exudes a fair amount of 
oil, but holds its shape, even if fried until well brown and crisp. The 
photo speciman is medium aged, purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $8.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<hr class=hr4s>

<h2 id="na">Americas - North</h2>

<p>The United States and Canada, once home only to dismal factory cheeses, 
are now major producers of authentic and artisan cheeses rivaling those 
of Europe. Some are made using the traditional European names, which 
really pisses off the Europeans, so these names are increasingly 
prefixed by "American". Of course, we still make our traditional factory 
"cheese products" too, some of which are popular abroad as well.</p>

<h3>American Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (United States)
<br><img src="img/cz_american04h.jpg" alt="American Cheese Slices"  width="220" height="184" class=mrg>
<p>
This "processed cheese" was originally made from a blend of cheeses, 
generally colby and cheddar, but is now manufactured from components, 
generally milk, whey, milkfat, milk protein concentrate, whey protein 
concentrate, salt. Together, these meet a Federal definition, though 
each manufacturer has a slightly different formula. Those labeled 
"American Cheese" and "American Process Cheese" are fairly similar to 
real cheese, while those labeled "American Cheese Food" or "American 
Cheese Product" are more like Velveeta and Cheez Whiz.</p>
<p>Color can range from white to orange depending on how much annatto or 
food coloring is used. "Individually wrapped" products (photo) are the 
least natural. They aren't actually "wrapped", the contents 
is "cast in place", poured into the wrappers and solidified there. Blocks 
and sliced blocks more approximate real cheese. American Cheese is valued 
for it's neat slicing and good melting properties and is mainly used for 
sandwiches, both hot and cold.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cheddar - Mild Industrial Cheddar</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_chedindust02h.jpg" alt="Industrial Cheddar Block"  width="220" height="160" class=mrg>
<p>
A dense, firm, undistinguished cheese with little tang and almost always 
dyed yellow/orange. It melts completely, exuding a moderate amount of 
oil, but is a bit rubbery, and when cooled it is quite rubbery. To 
compensate, it is usually coarsely grated before sprinkling on things 
for melting in the oven or under the broiler. It's completely unusable  
for applications like 
<a href="../recipes/bbd_wrabbit1.html">Welsh Rabbit</a> but is more 
flavorful than American Cheese in sandwiches. It is often grated 
for use in tacos and the like.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="colby">Colby</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Colby Cheddar (obs.), 
  Longhorn Cheddar, (Wisconsin USA)]
<br><img src="img/cz_colby01h.jpg" alt="Colby Half Circle"  width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
<p>
First produced in Colby, Wisconsin, this is a semi-hard, mild, washed curd 
cheese that is not cheddared and is normally dyed orange. It is most often 
made in long cylinders (thus the name "longhorn") and sold in half round 
blocks. It is often combined with the similarly made Monterey Jack cheese 
to produce a marbled product called "Colby Jack".</p>
<p> Colby is a bit Velveeta-like in flavor and texture and can be used 
similarly but is also used as a table cheese and grated as a brownable 
topping for dishes finished in the broiler or oven. It melts well, exuding 
a moderate amount of oil and doesn't become too rubbery when it cools. 
Colby doesn't keep well so should be used within 7 days of opening the 
package. Pasteurized cow milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes, annatto.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cottage Cheese</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_cotteg01e.jpg" alt="Small &amp; Large Curd"  width="260" height="157" class=mrg>
Cottage cheese was originally made in many small farm houses as a fresh, 
unpressed washed curd cheese retaining a significant amount of whey. 
There are two traditional processes, one using only milk culture to 
produce slightly acidic "Small Curd", and the other using culture and 
rennet to produce a less acid "Large Curd" cheese.
<p>You will have a hard time determining these processes from tubs 
of commercial cottage cheese, as they are now highly industrialized 
products made by modified processes from mixes of milk, cream and 
whey, with lots of additives which may include citric acid, carrageenan, 
mono and diglycerides, polysorbate 80 guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan 
gum, maltodextrin, dextrose, enzymes and various other substances. The 
photo shows commercial small curd to the left, large curd to the right.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cream Cheese, American</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_creamamer01h.jpg" alt="American Cream Cheese"  width="220" height="220" class=mrg>
This was originally made from cow milk and cream, but has become an 
industrial product. It is often sold in boxed foil wrapped blocks, but 
also in tubs. It is mild and spreadably soft, and when heated becomes 
very soft, but does not flow or seep oil (small slice on the left in 
photo is browned on the underside but held its shape). The most common 
brand is Kraft's Philadelphia Cream Cheese. Ingredients for "Regular" 
are: Pasteurized nonfat cow milk and milkfat, cheese culture, whey protein 
concentrate, salt, guar gum, carob bean gum, 32% fat.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Farmers Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Hoop Cheese (a 
  little firmer)]
<br><img src="img/cz_farmers08d.jpg" alt="Farmers Cheese"  width="300" height="158" class=mrg>
<p>This is basically cottage cheese (small curd process) with the liquid 
squeezed out of it. Squeeze it even more and you get Hoop Cheese. Squeeze 
a little less and you get Pot Cheese. It is fairly soft but somewhat 
crumbly. This cheese softens but does not melt when heated, keeping its 
shape even until it starts to burn, as in the photo.</p>
<p>Farmers cheese, once scarce here, has become very common in Southern 
California due to the growing population from Eastern Europe. It is 
interchangeable with cheeses from that region and is much used for 
filling pastries, pierogi / piroshke and for similar uses. It is 
perishable so refrigerate and use within a week of opening. That most 
common here in Los Angeles is from Lifeway. Ing: Cultured pasteurized 
low fat milk, potassium sorbate.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Karoun Caliornia Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [California]
<br><img src="img/cz_karcal01h.jpg" alt="Block of Karoun California Cheese"  width="220" height="202" class=mrg>
<p>An unripened, lightly salted whole milk cheese made in California by a 
leading manufacturer of Levantine, Anatolian and Caucasian cheeses. 
It has a light, squeeky chew and good flavor. It softens, but does not 
melt, and exudes no liquid or oil. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $4.99 / pound. Cultured 
pasteurized Grade A whole milk, calcium, natural flavor, salt, non-animal 
kosher rennet. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Monterey Jack</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Jack Cheese, 
  Queso Monterey (California)]
<br><img src="img/cz_monterey02h.jpg" alt="Jack Cheese block"  width="220" height="162" class=mrg>
<p>
Originally made by Franciscan monks in Monterey California, this cheese 
was put into production by David Jack, thus "Jack Cheese". Cultured 
whole milk, salt, enzymes. Because it is very low in tyramine, 
Monterey Jack is considered one of the safer cheeses for migraine 
sufferers.</p>
<span>This cheese melts particularly well and is not too rubbery when 
cooled. It is normally sold as a mild, white, semi-hard cheese with 
about one month of age, but there are variations:</span>
<br class=cll>
<table>
<tr><td class=ind><br></td><td>
   <ul>
   <li><b>Aged Monterey Jack:</b> is aged for 6 months or more, often by 
     others than the original producer.</li>
   <li><b>Colby Jack</b> is a mix of chunks of orange Colby and white 
     Monterey Jack, giving the cheese a marbled effect.</li>
   <li><b>Dry Jack</b> was invented during WWII as a substitute for 
     Parmesan which was unavailable.</li>
   <li><b>Pepper Jack</b> has chopped chilis mixed in. It is often used in 
     recipes such as quesadillas but also appears on cheese plates.</li>
   </ul>
   </td></tr></table>


<h3>Mozzarella - Fresh California</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_motz09h.jpg" alt="Fresh California Mozz"  width="220" height="164" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese is made up into balls about 1-1/2 inches in diameter, 
weighing just over 1 ounce and packed in plastic bags or tubs floating 
in whey. It is called "Mozzarella" here in California, but is actually 
pretty much identical to the Italian Bocconcini.
</p>
<p>The texture is very soft with just a little of the fibrousness 
we associate with mozzarella and much milder than regular American 
Mozzarella. It melts very smoothly, exuding water rather than oil, and 
cools with a little more of the rubberiness we normally associate with 
mozzarella. Pasteurized cow milk, starter culture, salt, vegetable 
rennet.</p>
<p>I do not recommend fresh mozzarella for cooking because American 
recipes are all designed for the regular stuff, so fresh mozzarella 
would be bland, expensive and have little texture.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that mozzarella bars have sprung up in the 
more yuppified districts of Southern California (2008), and various dishes 
featuring fresh mozzarellas (including buffalo milk versions) can be had 
there at exorbitant prices, but I seldom stray into those districts.
A couple years ago they were very rare, but I now see plastic tubs of 
these balls in most of the markets I shop at (2013). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Muenster</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  (USA - Michigan, Wisconsin, California, etc.)
<br><img src="img/cz_muenst06h.jpg" alt="Slab of Muenster Cheese"  width="220" height="144" class=mrg>
<p>
This American cheese is remotely patterned after French 
Munster. It is very popular in North America and 
ranges from bland to as sharp as a young jack cheese. It is used on 
cheese plates, but is also widely used in dishes requiring melted cheese. 
It melts very well, exuding modest oil. A smooth, pale yellow cheese, 
it is generally made in loaves, the outside colored orange by paprika or 
another vegetable dye.  
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Neufch&acirc;tel - American</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_neuf01h.jpg" alt="Blob of American Neufchatel"  width="220" height="172" class=mrg>
American Neufch&acirc;tel was invented in 1872 in an imperfect attempt to 
make a cheese like French Neufch&acirc;tel. It was 
the first American cream cheese and is still sold as a lower fat 
substitute for regular American cream cheese. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Pinconning</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Michigan USA)
<br><img src="img/cz_pinconmv01h.jpg" alt="Slices of Pinconning Cheese"  width="220" height="199" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese, developed in Pinconning Michigan, is very similar to 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#colby">Colby</a> but the formula is a little different, allowing 
it to be aged. It ranges from mild to extra sharp depending on length of 
aging. A 10 year "super sharp" is available only by direct order from the 
Pinconning Cheese Company. Pinconning has a rich, creamy flavor and 
texture and is used as a table cheese in place of Colby or cheddar. It is 
also used for mac-and-cheese, in souffl&eacute;s, and as a base material 
for manufacturing cheese spreads.</p>
<p>The photo shows 10 year Extra Sharp to the left and Medium Sharp to 
the right. The extra sharp is somewhat crumbly and doesn't seem related 
to Colby at all. The medium sharp does retain some of its Colby 
heritage. Both melt smoothly. The medium seems to loose a bit of flavor, 
but does not become rubbery. The extra sharp melts to a thin oily liquid 
and is crumbly when cooled, but retains flavor well. Medium 2008 
US $6.19/pound, 10 year $13.49/pound. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Velveeta</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Velveta (Germany), Kraft Cheddar 
  Cheese (Australia), (Kraft Foods, U.S. & elsewhere)]
<br><img src="img/cz_velveta02h.jpg" alt="Velveeta block"  width="220" height="207" class=mrg>
<p>
A "pasteurized process cheese product" (it contains less than 51% cheese 
so can't legally be called a "processed cheese food"). It melts, easily 
and evenly, to a creamy consistency. Many claim it's the best product to 
use in the ever popular American macaroni and cheese, but many also 
complain it isn't as good as it used to be. Velveeta was invented in 
1918 by Swiss immigrant Emil Frey, so it's not all America's fault. The 
texture is smooth and creamy, soft but firm enough to slice. It is currently 
sold in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea, Australia and 
Germany.  This product does not need to be refrigerated after opening.
<br class=cll></p>

<hr class=hr4s>
<p></p>

<h2 id="mex">Americas - Mexico <small>&amp;</small> Central America</h2>

<p>Little cheese is imported from Mexico due to health considerations 
(it's mostly fresh cheeses), but many authentic Mexican type cheeses are 
now produced in high volume here in Southern California where there is 
obvious demand.</p>

<h3>Cotija</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Queso Cotija, (Mexico, California)]
<br><img src="img/cz_cotija02h.jpg" alt="Cotija wedge"  width="220" height="207" class=mrg>
<p>
Named for the Mexican town of Cotija, Michoacan, this is a stiff, crumbly 
cheese with modest tanginess and quite a bit of salt, aged 
from 3 months to a year. It is used mainly as a crumbled topping and in 
salads, because it not only doesn't melt, it hardly even softens. Avoid 
it for anything that requires a cheese that melts gracefully. There is 
also a softer version, Tajo Cheese, with less salt and less age. 
Pasteurized part skim cultured cow milk, salt, enzymes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Queso A&ntilde;ejo</h3> - See 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#qench"><b>Queso Enchilada</b></a><p></p>

<h3>Queso Asedero</h3>
<br>"Asedero" means "roasted", from it's usage as a melting cheese. 
Asederos have the stringiness when melted that's considered essential 
for many Mexican dishes. The two most available Queso Asederos are 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#oax"><b>Queso Oaxaca</b></a> and 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#qench"><b>Quesadilla</b></a>. Reasonable, but not exact, 
substitutes are Monterey Jack, Mozzarella and Provolone.<p></p>

<h3 id="blanco">Queso Blanco</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_qblanc01h.jpg" alt="Block of Queso Blanco"  width="220" height="226" class=mrg>
[Mexico, California]
<p>
Often sold in large loaf sized blocks, this cheese is similar to 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#fresco"><b>Queso Fresco</b></a>, except, when traditionally 
made it is coagulated not with renet, but with acid, as is Indian Paneer. 
Today, the acid may be helped by a microbic rennet, but it should still 
be ol vegetarian. This cheese softens, but does not melt. It exudes almost 
no water and almost no oil. Cultured pasteurized grade A milk, calcium 
chloride, non-animal Kosher rennet, salt, vinegar. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Queso Duro Viejo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (El Salvador)
<br><img src="img/cz_duro01h.jpg" alt="Block of Queso Duro Viejo"  width="220" height="198" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a mild table cheese. It doesn't really melt, but softens some 
and exudes some oil. It is aged 1 to 6 months. Perla brand, 2018 US 
$8.57 / pound, sold in 14 ounce blocks.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="qench">Queso Enchilada</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [A&ntilde;ejo enchilado, Queso a&ntilde;ejo: (Mexico, California)]
<br><img src="img/cz_enchal06h.jpg" alt="Wheel of Enchilada Cheese"  width="220" height="219" class=mrg>
<p>
This firm aged cheese, both sliceable and grateable, is coated with a 
paste made from red chilis to inhibits mold during aging. Originally 
it was made from skimmed goat's milk, but nearly all is now made from 
skimmed cow's milk. It is mild, but has a little of the tang of an aged 
cheese. It is usually used as a grated topping because it doesn't really 
melt.</p>
<p>Heated, it becomes very soft but does not flow. When it cools it 
becomes firm but not rubbery. Pasteurized cow milk and skim cow milk, 
sea salt, paprika, enzymes. Actually that "paprika" is dried New Mexico 
chili or similar. This cheese is made in 4 inch wheels as in the photo, 
and in blocks.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id=fresco>Queso Fresco</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Mexico, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_fresco03h.jpg" alt="Half Wheel of Fresh Cheese"  width="220" height="206" class=mrg>
<p>
Literally "fresh cheese". A part skim milk cheese that's very soft, 
yet crumbly, with a very mild milk-like flavor and just a trace of 
tartness. Unlike <a href="da_cheesev.html#blanco"><b>Queso Blanco</b></a>, it is 
traditionally made using rennet, which may be animal rennet. While 
widely made in Mexico, that available in California is made north of 
the border due to health issues. Even here in Los Angeles there have 
been rare outbreaks of listeriosis resulting from sanitation lapses

<p>When heated, it exudes a lot of water, and gets very soft and bubbly 
but doesn't actually melt. It is sold in 4 inch wheels as in the photo, 
and as blocks.  Cow milk and skim cow milk, sea salt, culture, enzymes.

<p>
A whole milk "Fresh Cheese" that's moderately soft with a mild flavor 
and just a trace of tartness. It is not at all crumbly. While a Mexican 
type cheese, that available in California is made north of the border due 
to health issues. This one was made in San Jose, California.</p> <p>When 
heated, it exudes almost no water, and gets very soft, but will brown 
without actually melting. It is sold in 4 inch wheels as in the photo. 
Pasteurized cow milk, salt, enzymes, 21% fat, 2014 US $3.66/pound.

<h3>Queso Morolique</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (El Salvador)
<br><img src="img/cz_morol01h.jpg" alt="Block of Morolique Cheese"  width="220" height="222" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a mild table cheese. It doesn't really melt, but softens some 
and exudes very little oil. Perla brand, 2018 US $8.57 / pound, sold in 
14 ounce blocks.

<h3>Manchego</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_manchm02h.jpg" alt="Wheel of Manchego Cheese"  width="220" height="181" class=mrg>
This Mexican cheese is <u>not</u> to be confused with the Manchego of 
Spain. This one is more related to Monterey Jack. It is fairly firm and 
melts very well, exuding little oil. It has been aged sufficiently to 
develop some tang, but is quite mild. It is used as both a table cheese 
and for cooking. Pasteurized part skim cow milk, sea salt, enzymes.

<h3 id="oax">Oaxaca</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Queso asadero]
<br><img src="img/cz_oaxaca7e.jpg" alt="Knot of Oaxaca Cheese"  width="260" height="174" class=mrg>
<p>
This Mexican cheese is now manufactured and widely available here in 
Southern California. Similarly to mozzarella, this mildly tangy cheese 
has been stretched until fibrous, then knotted into a lump. It melts 
very smoothly, exuding very little oil, and when melted strings well when 
pulled, considered a necessity for a Mexican melting cheese. At certain 
temperatures it can seem just a bit rubbery.  The photo specimen was 
about 4-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 12 ounces. Cultured pasteurized 
milk, salt, enzymes and sodium citrate.

<h3>Panela</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Queso Panela, Queso Canasta, 
  Quesillo, (Mexico, California, also Paraguay, Nicaragua, Bolivia, 
  Chile and Ecuador)]
<br><img src="img/cz_panel08h.jpg" alt="Panela, half wheel"  width="220" height="202" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a white fresh cheese but differs significantly from 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#fresco">Queso Fresco</a> It has a mild fresh cheese flavor 
but firm enough to slice well. It can be crumbled, but not as easily 
as Fresco.  The cheese is made in 4 inch wheels, the outer surface of 
which are textured to resemble the texture imparted by the little 
baskets in which it was traditionally made.</p>
<p>This cheese is often diced or crumbled for salads, enchiladas and 
tacos but is also sometimes cut into slices and fried until lightly 
browned as a snack.  When heated it softens moderately but holds it's 
shape, even until browned, exuding neither water nor oil. 
Pasteurized part skim cow milk, salt, enzymes. The photo specimen was 
a 4 inch wheel weighing 10 ounces at 2013 US $4.00/pound.</p>
<p>This cheese seems to me a good substitute for Indian Paneer, though 
it is made with an enzyme coagulant rather than lemon juice. It is not 
to be confused with the Panela of Columbia, which is a similarly 
shaped cake of unrefined sugar cane juice.

<h3>Quesadilla / Asadero</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_quesd02h.jpg" alt="Half Wheel of Asadero"  width="220" height="213" class=mrg>
As the name implies, this is cheese for Quesadillas, tortillas folded 
over into a half circle with cheese and other ingredients between the 
layers. Of primary importance is how the cheese melts, and it melts 
easily and very smoothly with little oil exuded. When melted it is 
"stringy", considered a necessity for Mexican melting cheeses. This 
does mean it becomes a little rubbery when cooled, but not badly - and 
you're supposed to eat it while it's hot and melted anyway. This 
cheese is mild but has a good cheese flavor. It is similar to 
Queso Oaxaca but not stretched and formed in blocks.  Pasteurized milk, 
skim milk, sea salt, enzymes, annatto extract (color).

This is a Hispanic cheese similar to Italian Ricotta. It is made with 
about 10% milk added to the whey left from making other cheeses. It is 
creamy, spreadable, low fat and does not melt at all.

<p>
A rather creamy, buttery, semi-soft, mildly tangy "farmstead cheese" from 
Chile. It is the most popular cheese in Chile, and in 2005 became the 
first Chilean cheese imported into the United States. It melts smoothly, 
exuding moderate oil. Pasteurized cow milk, salt, calcium chloride, 
microbial rennet, dairy cultures, and has an invisible wax coating.

<h3>Reggianito</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Argentina)
<br><img src="img/cz_argreg03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Reggianito"  width="220" height="222" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese originated with Italian immigrants to Argentina, and is the 
longest aged cheese made in South America (5 to 6 months). Patterned 
after Italian Reggiano, it is called Reggianito because the wheels weigh 
15 pounds rather than the 80 pounds typical of the Italian cheese. It is 
a hard grating cheese with a slightly granular texture and slightly 
saltier than the Italian cheese. The photo specimen was purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2015 US $6.99 per pound. 
Made from pasteurized cow milk. Reggianito, similarly to the Italian 
cheese, melts reluctantly but well, without becoming runny, but it does 
exude a fair amount of oil. It is sliceable, but also grates very well.

<h2 class=lrg id="eac">Europe - Anatolia <small>&amp;</small> Caucasus</h2>

<p>This region includes Turkey, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Yes, 
some of these countries just don't get along, not even a little, but they 
share a culinary domain, including cheeses, so I'm lumping them here 
and they can just learn to deal with it.</p>

<p>Some authentic Armenian and Georgian cheeses are made in volume here 
in Southern California, (Glendale, California is "the Western Capital of 
Armenia"). Production of cheese in Armenia was discouraged during the 
Soviet era, when Lori (Russian Cheese) dominated. A joint Armenia - US 
Department of Agriculture program has resulted in greatly increased 
production of specialty Armenian cheeses, many of which are now (2019) 
imported into Southern California.</p>

<p>Turkey does export large amounts of cheese, particularly "White 
Cheese" which is much like Bulgarian Sirene (Bulgarian Feta in the U.S.). 
Azerbaijan is not at all noted for cheese, but interest is increasing 
rapidly there.</p>

<h3>Alashkert Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_alashk02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Areminan Alashkert Cheese"  width="220" height="244" class=mrg>
<p>
A soft, non-crumbly brine soaked cheese, made in wheels about 3-3/4 inches 
thick. It is fresh, mild, and moderately salty, with good aroma and flavor. 
This cheese melts very easily and smoothly, exuding very little oil and no 
water. The photo specimen was imported branded Ararat, though the "Alashkert" 
name and formula belongs to the Dustr Melania (Daughter Melania) cheese 
factory in Lori Province, northern Armenia. It is a new cheese developed in 
cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agricultue, and has found immediate 
popularity. Whole pasteurized cow milk, starter cultures, rennet, salt, 
calcium chloride. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Sunland) for 2021 US $8.49 / pound.

<h3>Armenian String Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_armostr06e.jpg" alt="Armenian String Cheese"  width="260" height="142" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a moderately firm white cheese that is pulled into an endless 
loop until it is formed into yarns that have a stringy texture. The 
yarns are then twisted up into a hank and vacuum packed for distribution. 
This cheese, made by several Armenian dairies here in Los Angeles, 
differs somewhat from the more traditional Chechil Cheese (see below).
</p>
<p>This cheese is very popular as a snack cheese, and so much better 
than the sticks of "string cheese" sold by major brands in the 
supermarkets. Armenian String Cheese can also be found smoked, similar 
to smoked mozzarella, and is sometimes packed with olive oil and herbs 
as well as with and without nigella seeds.</p>
<p> The photo hank weighed 1 pound and was 7-1/2 inches by 3 inches, 
cultured pasteurized milk, kosher rennet, salt and nigella seeds. It 
was made here in Los Angeles by Karoun Dairies, but we have several 
other fine manufacturers of this cheese here. All their products are 
very similar.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Armenian Sweet Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia, California) 
<br><img src="img/cz_armosweet01h.jpg" alt="Slab of Sweet Cheese"  width="220" height="162" class=mrg>
<p>
A very fresh soft cheese used mainly in Armenian pastries. "Sweet" means 
it has very little salt and no tang from fermentation, which means it's 
very mild in flavor and highly perishable. This cheese melts completely, 
exuding no oil, and is just faintly rubbery when cooled, but the flavor 
is enhanced by the melting.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was made in Los Angeles. Whole pasteurized milk, 
vegetable rennet, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chanakh Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_chana01h.jpg" alt="Block of Areminan Chanakh Cheese"  width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
<p>
A soft, non-crumbly cheese soaked in brine, much used as a table cheese 
to accompany fruits, vegetables, and wine. It is fresh, mild, and salty, 
with a lightly fermented aroma and flavor. This cheese melts to a thin 
liquid almost instantly, exuding neither oil nor water. The photo 
specimen was Golden Goat brand, made in Armenia:  whole pasteurized cow 
milk, salt, cheese cultures. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Sunland).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chechil Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Chechil, Husats, Tel (Armenia, 
  Georgia);  &ccedil;e&ccedil;il, tel peyniri (Turkey)]
<br><img src="img/cz_chech04e.jpg" alt="Hanks of Chechil Cheese"  width="260" height="132" class=mrg>
<p>
A rather firm white cheese that is pulled into an endless loop until 
it is formed into yarns made of hair-like fibers. It is matured in brine 
and often smoked. The photo specimens, from Georgia, were formed into 
braids and vacuum packed. This cheese is much tougher and stretchier 
than the Armenian String Cheese we are acustomed to here in California, 
the fibers are much finer, like hair, and it is saltier. This cheese 
does not melt. It's mainly a snack cheese, and in Russia is commonly 
served with beer.</p>
<p>Typically, hanks weigh 3.5 ounces each and are 8 inches long and 
1-1/2 inches wide. The photo specimens were purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $11.99 per 
pound. Pasteurized whole milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzyme. The 
smoked version was smoked over beechwood chips.

<h3>Chechil Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Chechil (Armenia)]
<br><img src="img/cz_checha02h.jpg" alt="Block of Chechil Cheese"  width="220" height="195" class=mrg>
<p>
This form of Chechil Cheese is sold in block form, brine cured and aged. 
It has a good tang from the ageing. It does melt, exuding quite a bit of 
oil and bubbling from water from the brining. The photo specimen was 
purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 
2018 US $11.99 per pound. Product of Armenia: pasteurized cow milk, 
cheese cultures, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Dzor Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_dzor02h.jpg" alt="Block of Areminan Dzor Cheese"  width="220" height="197" class=mrg>
<p>
A firm aged goat cheese from the Vayots Dzor region in Armenia. Goat 
cheese was almost unknown in Armenia until 2005 when Golden Goat 
started production with Armenian goats cross bred with American goats 
which produced up to 3 times as much milk as pure Armenian goats. 
This cheese has a good goat tang and melts smoothly exuding only a 
little oil. The photo specimen was Golden Goat brand, made in Armenia:  
whole pasteurized whole goat milk, cheese cultures, salt. The photo 
specimen was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Sunland) for 2019 US $8.69 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Erebuni Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_erub02h.jpg" alt="Block of Areminan Erebuni Cheese"  width="220" height="205" class=mrg>
<p>A semi-soft salty, cheese including herbal flakes (possibly green 
chili). It is named for the Erebuni district of Yerevan, Armenia, 
where the ancient Erebuni fortress is. I have used this lightly tangy 
cheese instead of Feta in salads, and it worked very well. It's firmer 
than Feta and can be sliced into small dice which hold their shape, but 
crumble easily to the fork. This cheese does not melt, but softens, 
exuding no oil or water. The photo specimen was Golden Goat brand, 
made in Armenia:  whole pasteurized cow milk, cheese cultures, salt, 
herbs. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Sunland) for 2019 US $6.59 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Gladzor Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_gladz01h.jpg" alt="Block of Areminan Gladzor Cheese"  width="220" height="198" class=mrg>
<p>A firm salty cheese including flakes of red and green chili but with 
very little heat. It is named for the town of Gladzor in the Vayots Dzor 
region of Armenia. This cheese does not melt, but softens and exudes a 
little oil. The photo specimen was Golden Goat brand, made in Armenia:  
whole pasteurized milk, (goat and cow), bacteial cheese cultures, salt, 
herbs. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Sunland).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Horadz Panir</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Armenia] 
<br><img src="img/cz_horadz02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Hordaz Panir Cheese"  width="220" height="167" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese was Ararat brand, with "Horadz Panir" in both Roman and 
Armenian characters, but was actually made in Bulgaria, a major center 
for white cheese production. The label said "100% Sheep's Milk - Sharp 
&amp; Aged", but it's a little "sanitized" compared to the traditional 
Armenian method, which is to pack the sheep cheese in a clay jar and 
bury it. That product comes out considerably more smelly. It is often 
eaten with Lavash bread.</p>
<p>This cheese is very crumbly, much like a Turkish white Tulum, but 
that cheese melts. This one softens and releases a moderate amount of 
oil, but does not melt. The photo specimen did not brown on the bottom 
because the cheese contains too much water. The photo specimen was 
purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) 
for 2017 US $4.99 / pound.

<p>
Named for the Imeruli region in West Central Georgia, this is a fresh 
white cheese, aged about 2 days. It is variously made and may be a bit 
crumbly, or have a lot of holes. It is not much available in North 
America, but it's not difficult to make it yourself. Whole cow milk, 
rennet, salt.

<br><img src="img/cz_kasseri04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Kasar Cheese"  width="220" height="184" class=mrg>
<p>
A yellow sheep milk hard cheese made in central Anatolia. It is also 
sometimes made with cow milk or a mixture of sheep and cow. It is 
traditionally put up in cylindrical molds and aged for at least a month, 
but aging in bee's wax is now being done. Traditionally raw milk was used 
with the cheese cultured by the milk's own flora, but today it is made 
from pasteurized milk using yogurt as a starter.  Kasar is a meltable 
cheese used in recipes, but is also used as a table cheese. The photo 
is actually of Bulgarian Kasseri, but Bulgaria has very close culinary 
ties with Turkey.</p>
<p>Eski Kasar (old Kasar) is put up in sacks and aged 6 months in an 
ice house. If made from pure sheep milk it can be kept for up to 
3 years.

<h3>Lori</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Russian Cheese (Armenia, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_lori01e.jpg" alt="Slab of Lori Cheese"  width="260" height="153" class=mrg>
<p>
This semi-soft, pungent, somewhat salty cheese has a sort of spongy 
texture (lots of small holes) and melts very smoothly, exuding very 
little oil. The photo specimen was from a block about 5 by 5-1/4 inches 
by about 12 inches long. Lori is a region in northern Armenia, but this 
block was probably made in Los Angeles, as we have several manufacturers 
here. This seems to be pretty much the same as Russian Cheese 
(Rossiiski syr).

<h3>Sulguni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Suluguni; (Georgia, California)]
<br><img src="img/cz_sulguni05e.jpg" alt="Sulguni wedges"  width="260" height="213" class=mrg>
<p>
Typical of the highly respected Georgian cuisine, this firm white cheese 
is very popular in Georgia, Russia, Armenia and Southern California. 
It is similar to mozzarella but a little softer and with a smooth texture 
(mozzarella is stringy from pulling and kneading). It melts very well. 
In Georgia it is often just sliced, coated with flour and fried, and is 
also used in making cheese bread.</p>
<p>In California it is commonly made up into 1 pound 5-1/4 inch wheels 
which are also popular smoked. The photo shows a wedge of smoked, a 
wedge of regular, and a piece melted. Typically part skim milk, enzymes, 
salt, bacterial rennet (Georgian production would likely use animal 
rennet) 18% fat, 0.61% sodium. <u>Subst</u>: standard market mozzarella 
(expensive fresh mozzarella doesn't work well).

<h3>Tulum, White</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tulumu, Tulum paynin (Turkey)]
<br><img src="img/cz_tulum02h.jpg" alt="Half Wheel of Tulum"  width="220" height="202" class=mrg>
<p>
This raw sheep and/or goat milk cheese is traditionally ripened in 
goatskin bags called "tulum", thus the name of the cheese. White 
crumbly tulum is characteristic of the eastern regions of Turkey. 
The taste is herbal, slightly sour and moderately salty. This cheese 
melts well. Feta (Turkish "white cheese") would be a suitable substitute 
in salads, but not in cooked dishes (feta doesn't melt).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tulum, Yellow</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tulumu, tulum paynin (Turkey)]
<br><img src="img/cz_tulum01h.jpg" alt="Slab of Yellow Tulum"  width="220" height="228" class=mrg>
<p>
While the majority of tulum cheeses are white, yellow versions that are 
firmer and tangier and saltier are also made, mostly in the western 
regions of Turkey. Made from raw sheep and/or goat milk and aged in 
goatskin bags, this cheese melts well. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Vernashen Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Armenia)
<br><img src="img/cz_verna02h.jpg" alt="Block of Armenian Vernashen Cheese"  width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese is soft and spreadable, but quite rich with a distinct aged 
tang. It is produced in Armenia, named for the region noted for red 
semi-sweet Vernashen wine. It is Great Masis brand, produced by Golden 
Goat Cheese Factory. Pasteurized whole milk, cheese cultures, 
salt. It was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Sunland) for 2020 US $7.29.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>White Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Beyaz panir; (Turkey)]
<br><img src="img/cz_feta01h.jpg" alt="Block of Turkish White Cheese"  width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
<p>
While this term can be variously used, it is currently being used 
to indicate <a href="da_cheesev.html#feta">Feta</a> type cheeses made outside of 
Greece. After a long, hard fought legal battle against Denmark, a 
major producer of this type of cheese, the EU gave Greece a monopoly 
on the word "Feta". Some consider this unfair, as this cheese has been 
made for thousands of years throughout Southeastern Europe and Anatolia.
</p>
<p>Turkey is also a major producer of this type cheese, but is not 
affected by this ruling. Turkey is not yet a part of the EU, but no 
matter - the Turks have always called theirs "White Cheese".

<p>
This goat cheese is soft spreadable, with a sharp salty taste. It is 
a "steamed" cheese. Product of Armenia: Pasteurized whole goat milk, 
cheese cultures, salt, and an undeclared herb. It was purchased from 
a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $12.99

<p>
This is a traditional English cheese, the prototype of cheeses now 
made in England, United States, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and 
elsewhere.  It is dense and firm, with taste varying from mild to 
extra sharp, and texture from smooth to crumbly, depending on length 
of aging. It can range from white to orange depending on the amount 
of annatto coloring included.</p>
<p>Good Natural Cheddar melts smoothly and almost to a liquid - not at 
all rubbery. It cools to a somewhat grainy texture, again, not 
at all rubbery. The photo specimen was England Coastal Cheddar, made 
from Pasteurized milk, cheese culture, salt, vegetable rennet, aged 
a minimum of 16 months. It melted quickly and smoothly, almost to a 
liquid, exuding moderate oil, 32% fat, 2013 US $7.49/pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_chesh02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Cheshire Cheese"  width="220" height="226" class=mrg>
<p>
<p>This is the earliest recorded cheese made in England.  It is 
a firm, somewhat crumbly cheese, but today is made less firm than in 
the past when it was supplies for British warships (1758) and needed to 
stand up to rough transportation and long storage. Most production is 
"white" in the photo, but some "red" (colored with annatto) is made 
and some "blue", infected with blue mold, similar to Stilton. 
Cheshire melts slowly and exudes quit a bit of oil. Pasteurized cow milk, 
cheese cultures, rennet, salt; 2014 US $3.99/pound (special price).

The photo specimen  melted fairly smoothly, exuding a lot of oil, but 
also a lot of moisture. Double Gloucester (Pasteurized cow milk, salt, 
annatto, cheese cultures, vegetable rennet), rehydrated onion, freeze 
dried chives; 32% fat, 2015 US $6.69/pound.

<h3>Derby</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (England - Derbyshire)
<br><img src="img/cz_derbys01h.jpg" alt="Block of Sage Derby Cheese"  width="220" height="183" class=mrg>
<p>
Made in Derbyshire, England, this is a mild, buttery, semi-firm cheese, 
similar to cheddar but softer and aged for a shorter time - one month 
to 6 months depending on firmness desired. It is naturally a cream or 
pale golden color, but the most common variety is mixed with sage, 
giving it a mottled green and cream color. There is also a port wine 
version. The photo specimen  melted enthusiastically, exuding very 
moderate oil. Pasteurized cow milk, salt, cheese cultures, vegetarian 
rennet, dried sage leaves, chlorophyll. Purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland).

<br><img src="img/cz_gamekp02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gamekeeper Cheese"  width="220" height="220" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese is made up of Blue Shropshire Cheese layered with and embedded 
with mild Cheddar. In my opinion it is a really fine cheese plate cheese, 
though perhaps a little strong for those with "refined tastes". The name 
"Gamekeeper" is a trademark of Cropwell Bishop Creamery. Cheddar Cheese 
(63%): milk, salt, dairy cultures, vegetarian rennet - Blue Shropshire 
Cheese (37%): Milk, Salt, Color E160B, vegetarian rennet, dairy cultures, 
2014 US $5.99/pound.

<h3 id="glouc">Gloucester - Single, Double, Cotswold, Huntsman</h3> 
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (England)
<br><img src="img/cz_gloucd02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gloucester Cheese"  width="220" height="193" class=mrg>
<p>
Made in Gloucestershire, England, Gloucester Cheese comes in four  
versions, Single, Double, Cotswold and Huntsman / Stilchester. All 
are semi-hard cheeses. Single is slightly crumbly, and is sold mostly 
in the region. Double has more age, a stronger flavor and is firmer, 
while Cotswold has chives and scallions mixed in. Huntsman has layers 
of Double Gloucester and Stilton.</p>
<p>The photo specimen of Double Gloucester was fairly soft, with a 
pleasant flavor and good aged tang. Originally, double gloucester was 
colored with <a href="gn_madder.html">Lady's Bedstraw</a>, but annatto 
is now used. The photo specimen melted very easily and very smoothly, 
exuding a lot of oil and a fair amount of moisture, becoming almost 
completely transparent. Pasteurized cow milk, 
salt, cheese cultures, vegetable rennet, annatto (color). Purchased 
from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $6.19/pound.

<h3>Gloucester - Double with Chives &amp; Onion</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  (England)
<br><img src="img/cz_dgloco02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gloucester with Chives &amp; Onions"  width="220" height="234" class=mrg>
<p>
Made in Gloucestershire, England, this cheese was very crumbly and 
very pungent. It melts to a paste, exuding lots of oil. Pasteurized 
cow milk, onion granules and dried chives, vegetable rennet, cheese 
cultures, annatto (color). Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles for 2017 US $3.99/pound.

<h3>Irish Cheddar, Mature</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Ireland)
<br><img src="img/cz_irishcdr02h.jpg" alt="Block of Irish Cheddar"  width="220" height="208" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a typical matured Irish Cheddar. It melts easily and smoothly, 
exuding quite a bit of oil.  Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $5.99 / pound.Wexford Creamery, 
Wexford, Ireland. Pasteurized whole milk, salt, starter cultures, 
rennet. Milk fat 34%.

<h3>Irish Cheddar with Porter</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Ireland)
<br><img src="img/cz_irishporter01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Porter Cheese"  width="220" height="213" class=mrg>
<p>
Striking in appearance, this cheese tastes pretty much like regular 
cheddar, though it has a vaguely chocolatey flavor from dark Irish 
beer. At 2010 US $11/pound, use it where you want a decorative - use 
regular cheddar otherwise. Once you open this, eat it soon - it goes 
to mold like nobody's business.

<h3>Red Leicester</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Leicestershire] (England - 
  Leicestershire)
<br><img src="img/cz_redleic02h.jpg" alt="Block of Leicester Cheese"  width="220" height="204" class=mrg>
<p>
Originally called Leicestershire and colored with carrot or beet juice, 
it is now colored with annatto. It was renamed during WWII to 
differentiate it from "White Leicester", a national wartime recipe. 
Red Leicester is made similarly to cheddar, but is more crumbly, and 
is very dependent on age for its tang and texture. The photo specimen, 
from England, was aged over 15 months. It melts smoothly, exuding a 
fair amount of oil. 2019 US $4.99 / pound. Pasteurized milk, salt, 
cheese cultures, rennet, annatto (color): 34% fat.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="stilt">Stilton, Blue</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (England, PDO Derbyshire, 
  Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire) 
<br><img src="img/cz_stilton03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Blue Stilton"  width="220" height="215" class=mrg>
<p>
This is England's primary entry for blue cheese, but there is a much less 
well known White Stilton. The blue is strong smelling and quite pungent, 
with an edible moldy rind. "Stilton" cannot be made in the village of 
Stilton because it is outside the PDO region - theirs is called "Village 
Blue from Stilton". Stilton eaten before bedtime is reputed to produce 
strange and vivid dreams, confirmed by a 2005 study.</p>

<p>Though used in a few soups, Stilton melts to an ugly crumbly liquid 
which never solidifies, and flavor is not improved by melting. Primarily 
this is a table cheese eaten with celery sticks and crackers.
Pasteurized cow milk, salt, microbial rennet, cheese cultures, 36% fat, 
2010 US $11.49/pound.

<h3>Wensleydale</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (England, Wensleydale, 
  North Yorkshire) 
<br><img src="img/cz_wensl02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Wensleydale Cheese"  width="220" height="178" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese was originally made by French monks who moved to England, 
but Henry VIII dissolved all the monasteries in 1540. It is quite moist, 
yet crumbly, and has a sweet mild taste with hints of honey. It goes very 
well with fruit, which is sometimes embedded in it, particularly 
cranberries or cherries. Plain white Wensleydale is traditionally eaten 
with apple pie.</p>

<p>Originally, this cheese was mostly a blue cheese, but blue Wensleydale 
is very rare today. The monks started with sheep milk, but migrated to 
cow milk. Pasteurized cow milk, sugar, cherries, cherry flavor, sunflower 
oil, vegetable rennet, cheese cultures; 29% fat, 2013 US $4.39/pound.

<h3>Basque Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France - Pyrenees) 
<br><img src="img/cz_basq03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Basque Cheese"  width="220" height="185" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a very firm cheese with excellent aged flavor. It melts smoothly 
with medium oil and has an excellent melted taste, but at the price 
you'll not be using this as a melting cheese. It'll be strictly on the 
cheese plate. The rind is coated with wax which doesn't peel, so it 
has to be carefully cut off. The photo specimen is from a mini-wheel 
marketed by Trader Joe's at 2013 US $10.99 / pound. Pasteurized sheep 
milk, salt, animal rennet, calcium chloride, lactic starter, color: 
caramel, annatto.

<h3>Boursin</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (France - Normandy) 
<br><img src="img/cz_bours01h.jpg" alt="Lump of Boursin Cheese"  width="220" height="190" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a brand of spreadable Gournay (Normandy) cheese packaged 
in small boxes. It is similar to cream cheese but flavored. It was 
invented in 1957 by Fran&ccedil;ois Boursin to save party guests 
from having to add their own herb to fresh cheese. The first and 
still most popular is "Garlic and Fine Herbs". It is currently 
owned by Bel Brands, the (Laughing Cow company). The photo specimen 
was "Manufactured for Bel Brands USA" by Atalanta Corp. in Elizabeth 
New Jersey. Ingred: Pasteurized Cultured Milk and Cream, Garlic*, 
Salt, White Pepper, Parsley*, Chives*, *Dried.

<h3>Brie</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France, Seine-et-Marne - imitated in 
  Somerset (UK), Wisconsin (US) and elsewhere)
<br><img src="img/cz_brie04h.jpg" alt="Brie wedge"  width="220" height="210" class=mrg>
<p>
A very soft whole or part skim cow milk cheese with an edible white moldy 
rind. Proper brie is not available in the U.S. or Australia due to our 
governments' penchant for protecting us from things we don't need 
protection from. Brie shipped to the U.S. must be made from pasteurized 
milk which changes the flavor and texture. In Europe the name "Brie" is 
protected and limited to a particular region of France but cheeses named 
"brie" are made worldwide outside of Europe.</p>
<p>This cheese is extremely popular and is almost always eaten plain or 
spread on crackers or some such. The rind should always be eaten along 
with the rest. Double and triple cream versions are now made for the 
yuppie trade but taste a bit more like butter than like cheese.</p>
<p><b>Brie Noir</b> is a version aged for several months to a year (normal 
brie is aged for one month) and the rind has becomes darker and crumbly.

<h3>Brillat-Savarin</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France -  Burgundy, Normandy) 
<br><img src="img/cz_brillat01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Brillat Savarin Cheese"   width="220" height="260" class=mrg>
<p>
A soft, creamy, high fat cheese made in Burgundy and Normandy since 
about 1932. It is sold fresh or aged 1 to 2 weeks and is lightly salty 
with just a touch of sourness. It is said to pair well with Ale and 
Champaign, but not with red wine. The photo specimen is the "Fresh" 
version and has not yet formed much of a rind. It was cut from a 
typical wheel 4-3/4 inches diameter and 1-3/4 inches thick and weighing 
17.6 ounces (1/2 kilo). It was soft and spreadable. A sample melted down 
into a puddle and did not firm when cooled. Pasteurized cow milk and 
cream, rennet, salt, cultured milk; 33% fat. 2013 US $4.99 / pound 
(this may have been a liquidation price due to a major screw-up in the 
package labeling).  There is a version with significantly more than 2 
weeks age called Pierre Robert.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Camembert</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France - AOM, PDO Normandy) 
<br><img src="img/cz_cammember01h.jpg" alt="Wheel of Camembert Cheese"  width="229" height="197" class=mrg>
<p>
A soft, creamy surface ripened cheese made from cow's milk, similar to 
Brie, but made in small wheels rather than large.  Properly, the milk is 
unpasteurized, and must be unpasteurized to achieve the designation 
"Camambert de Normandie". This causes problems importing into the U.S. 
so that shipped here is generally from pasteurized milk and over-aged, 
so it is not as runny as it should be. This is a "cheese plate" sort of 
cheese, served with crackers and the like. The rind is to be eaten with 
the cheese.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Comt&eacute;</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France - AOM ) 
<br><img src="img/cz_comte01h.jpg" alt="Slice from a Wheel of Comte"  width="220" height="177" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the most popular cheese in France, very firm, sliceable, 
non-crumbly and traditionally made in 100 pound wheels. Starting in the 
12th century it was made by cowherds during their long summer stay in 
the Jura mountains and brought to market in the fall. Today, most 
Comt&eacute; is aged from 7 to 18 months. It is dryish, very tangy and 
melts smoothly except at the rind. Raw cows milk, salt, animal rennet, 
lactic cultures, 45% fat. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Forest Smoked Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (France ) 
<br><img src="img/cz_frogsmk02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Forrest Smoked Cheese"  width="220" height="194" class=mrg>
<p>
A brie type soft "Smoked French Cheese", Hickory smoked processed cheese 
58% fat. Softe enough to spread - would go well on mild flavored 
crackers. GE SAS France 2018 US $5.99 / pound.

<h3>Madrigal</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (France ) 
<br><img src="img/cz_madrigal06h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Madrigal Cheese"  width="220" height="170" class=mrg>
<p>
Made in the Loire Valley, this is a French "Baby Swiss" and is very 
similar to Swiss Emmental, possessing a similar sweet nutty flavor and 
large "eyes", but its melting properties are significantly different. 
It softens but does not flow, in fact the photo specimen was starting 
to brown on the bottom and getting a bit dried out, but still no flow. 
Pasteurized whole cow milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes, 29% fat, 
2013 US $7.99 / pound.

<h3>Mimolette Fran&ccedil;aise</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Boule de Lille, 
  Vieux Hollande; (France )]
<br><img src="img/cz_mimol01h.jpg" alt="Slice from a Ball of Mimolette"  width="220" height="185" class=mrg>
<p>
This French cheese was created under orders of Louis XIVis as a 
replacement for imported Edam cheese. It is made by a similar process 
but with annatto added to color it orange for differentiation. Whole, 
it's a 4 pound a ball that resembles a cantaloupe. It melts smoothly, 
exuding little oil, but becomes very stiff when cooled. This cheese is 
stiff, smooth and has only a little tang - to me it seems a bit too close 
to a hard version of American cheese. Cow milk, salt, lactic starters, 
animal rennet, annatto, lysozyne (enzyme from egg white).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Morbier</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France - AOC Franche-Comt&eacute;)
<br><img src="img/cz_morb04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Morbier Cheese"  width="220" height="197" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a semi-soft cheese with a distinct line through the middle. This 
was originally ashes spread over the evening milk to protect it, then 
morning milk would be poured in to fill the mold. Today it is usually 
made from one milking and sometimes a vegetable dye is used to form the 
line. It is normally aged over 60 days.</p>
<p>The aroma is pungent, but the flavor is rich and creamy. There may be 
a slight bitter aftertaste. It melts well. Specific Morbiers are AOC 
protected, but some are made outside the AOC regions. Raw cows milk, 
salt, microbial rennet, cheese cultures, vegetable ash, natamycin, 
lisozyne (enzyme from egg white), 2010 US $8.99/pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Munster-g&eacute;rom&eacute;</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Munster; 
(France - AOC specific regions near the Alsace mountains)]
<br><img src="img/cz_munster01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Munster-Gerome"  width="220" height="185" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese has been made since at least CE 1371 under a system involving 
monasteries and the town of Munster. It is not to be confused with 
American Muenster which was rather distantly 
patterned after it. It is made from unpasteurized cow milk and the rind 
is washed periodically with brine. Small wheels (3 to 5 inches) are 
aged for about 5 weeks. Large wheels (5 to 8 inches) 2 to 3 months.

<h3>Neufch&acirc;tel</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_neufchatel01h.jpg" alt="Heart of Cheese"  width="220" height="232" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese has been made in France since about the 6th century. It is 
similar to Camembert, with a dry white edible mold rind, but is saltier 
and sharper. It is usually sold in heart shaped lumps, but also in 
logs and boxes.</p>
<p>American Neufch&acirc;tel was invented in 1872 in an attempt to make 
a cheese like French Neufch&acirc;tel. It was the first American cream 
cheese and is still sold as a lower fat substitute for regular American 
cream cheese. &nbsp; <small> Photo by Myrabella distributed under license

<br><img src="img/cz_portsalut04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Port Salut Cheese"  width="220" height="170" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese was monk made from 1815 until 1959 when the rights were sold 
to a major French creamery. It is now a factory made product, but some 
is still hand made in monasteries in the French countryside. The orange 
coating on the rind is edible, but it's made of wax so it is considered 
to detract from the cheese if left on. It is a mild semi-soft cheese but 
with a distinctive tang. It melts well exuding little oil. Pasteurized 
cow milk, salt, bacterial culture, microbial enzymes, annatto extract 
(color).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Roquefort</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (France - AOC Roquefort-sur-Soulzon)
<br><img src="img/cz_roquf03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Roquefort"  width="220" height="199" class=mrg>
<p>
This is one of the world's best known blue cheeses, made under carefully 
controlled conditions in just one location in France. It is possible it 
was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in CE 79, but this is not certain. It 
is certain that king Charles VI gave Roquefort-sur-Soulzon a monopoly 
on its production in 1411, but the cheese had already been made 
there for centuries.</p> 
<p>This is a soft and very pungent cheese, made in 6 pound wheels. It is 
aged for at least 90 days. Originally the mold was gathered by leaving 
bread on the floor of the aging caves until it was consumed by mold, 
then harvesting the mold, but today the mold is grown in laboratories. 
Raw whole sheep milk, salt, lactic starter, calf rennet, Penicillium 
roqueforti, 2015 US $10.99/pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_standr03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Saint-Andre Cheese"  width="220" height="221" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a triple cream cheese similar to Brie, but quite a bit firmer 
and made in a much thicker wheel (2-1/2 inches). Its fat content is so 
high it is said to make white wine taste slightly sour and metallic (I 
haven't confirmed this). Crusty bread and beer are suggested to be a 
better accompaniments It has a rich, buttery texture and a tangy edible 
rind. Quite perishable, it should be refrigerated and eaten within a 
few days of purchase. Pasteurized milk and cream, salt, lactic starter, 
enzyme - penicillium candidum, geotrichum (rind molds); 43% fat. 
2013 US $5.49 / pound.

<h3>Tomme</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tome (France, mostly Alpine regions, 
  Switzerland]
<br><img src="img/cz_tomme04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Tome Cheese"  width="220" height="209" class=mrg>
<p>
Tomme is a generic term for a group of low fat cheeses, generally 
followed by the point of origin. Tomme de Savoie is the best known, and 
Tomme de Montagne is a cover term for all Tommes from mountainous regions.
It is generally made from milk after the cream has been skimmed off to 
make butter or richer cheeses. Though primarily a table cheese, It melts 
smoothly, exuding little oil, and is used in some cooked dishes.</p>
<p>This cheese is firmer, saltier and less rich than Brie, but has a 
similar edible rind, which may be white or dark depending on region. 
The photo specimen is Tomme de Savoie, 90 days age, raw cow's milk, 
salt, lactic starters, rennet.

<br><img src="img/cz_limb02h.jpg" alt="Block of Limburger"  width="220" height="189" class=mrg>
<p>
This smear-ripened cheese is named for the former Duchy of Limburg where 
it was developed in the 19th century. Today, the Duchy is divided among 
Germany, Belgium and Netherlands. This cheese is now made mostly in 
Germany, but there is a popular version called Herve still made in the 
Belgian sector. There is a manufacturer in each of the United States and 
Canada, supplying German communities. This cheese is ripened for three 
months, after which it is soft, spreadable and smelly.</p>
<p>This cheese is most famous for its strong odor, produced by the 
bacteria <i>Brevibacterium linens</i>, one of the bacteria responsible 
for smelly feet.  This cheese is most often spread thickly on 100% rye 
bread and topped with a thick slice of onion. It is usually accompanied 
by brown mustard and lager beer or strong black coffee. Typically made 
from pasteurized cow milk, 29% fat.

<h3 id="feta">Feta</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_feta01h.jpg" alt="Block of Feta Cheese"  width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
Traditionally, Feta was a generic term for a rather crumbly semi-soft 
white cheese preserved in salt brine, but the EU recently gave Greece a 
monopoly on use of this name - the result of a long legal battle between 
Greece and Denmark. The Turks have always called theirs "White Cheese", 
so the Danes and other EU manufacturers are now following that practice.  
Major producers of this kind of cheese (there are many others) are Greece, 
Bulgaria, Turkey and Denmark, with Bulgarian and Danish most common now in 
Southern California markets.
<p>This cheese is normally made from sheep milk but goat and even cow milk 
have also been used. After coagulation it is pressed into blocks and cured 
for several months in a salt brine made from whey or water. It is packaged 
and shipped in brine and refrigerated. It can range from very mild to quite 
sharp depending on origin. Heated it becomes soft and sputters, but holds 
its shape and neither becomes runny nor exudes oil. Feta is an essential 
ingredient in Greek salads and in pastries from the region, as well as in 
sandwiches and as a topping for many dishes. It is most often cut into 
1/2 inch cubes or crumbled. For some applications it is soaked a while 
in cold water to reduce salt.  Typical ingredients: pasteurized whole 
sheep milk, salt, cultures, enzymes.

<h3>Halloumi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Hallumi (Cyprus); Hallumi; Hellim (Turk);] 
<br><img src="img/cz_hallo10h.jpg" alt="Halloumi Block and Fried Slice"  width="220" height="203" class=mrg>
<p>
This traditional cheese has been made on the island of Cyprus since 
Byzantine times (CE 395 to 1195). A mixture of goat and sheep milk is 
used, and sometimes a little cow milk as well, set with rennet. No acid 
forming bacterial cultures are used. This cheese is now popular not only 
in Cyprus, but also in Greece and the Levant.</p>
<p>This cheese is traditionally formed into a long rectangle which is 
then folded over to make a block, so slices are "C" shaped. It is a 
premier frying cheese, browning nicely without melting. It is protected 
for Cyprus in the US, but not yet in the EU due to a dispute as to 
whether cow milk should be allowed in it. It was originally wrapped in 
mint leaves which protected it from spoilage. This is no longer done, 
but some token mint is often added to the packaging. This cheese is 
rather bland, and after frying it is still bland, so dips and sauces 
are in order.</p>
<p>A similar but unrelated cheese, H&acirc;l&ucirc;mi is made in 
Egypt, the name meaning cheese in Coptic. This may be the source of 
the Cypriot name. The photo specimen, from Cyprus, was 3-1/4 x 2-1/4 x 
1-1/2 inches and weighed 9 ounces. Sheep and goat milk, salt, non animal 
rennet, mint, 2103 US $6.99/pound.

<h3>Kashkaval</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [(PDO Romania, specific regionals -

<br><img src="img/cz_kashka02e.jpg" alt="Block of Kashkaval Cheese"  width="260" height="151" class=mrg> 
<p>
This cheese, made in the Balkan countries, can be a bit confusing, 
because in the region "kashkaval" not only means this cheese, but 
is also used as a generic term for any yellow cheese - everything but 
"brined white cheese". Here in California it is used only to designate 
the one Balkan type cheese. This cheese has a flavor similar to a medium 
sharp white English cheddar, but the texture is much softer. It has 
excellent melting properties, exuding only a little oil. Kashkaval 
is also popular in the Levant, usually imported from the Balkans. 
The photo specimen was made in Hungary.

<h3>Kasseri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kasar, Kaser (Turk); (PDO Greece - 
  made also in Bulgaria and Turkey)]
<br><img src="img/cz_kasseri04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Kasseri Cheese"  width="220" height="184" class=mrg> 
<p>
This cheese has a slightly fibrous texture due to stretching of the 
curd, as in mozzarella, but it is much softer.  It is properly made from 
unpasteurized sheep milk, sometimes with a small amount of goat milk, 
and aged for at least four months to develop it's flavor. It has a 
mild but distinctive tang. It melts well and smoothly, exuding a fair 
amount of oil, but is more often used sliced. Provolone is sometimes 
considered a suitable substitute.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was from Bulgaria, labeled "Bulgarian Kasseri" 
(I don't know if they can get away with that within the EU). Pasteurized 
Sheep milk, salt, bacterial cultures, microbial enzymes, 25% fat, 
2013 US $7.49. This will be somewhat different in flavor from European 
kasseri because it is said that the flavor is only right with 
unpasteurized milk.</p>
<p>A cheese called "Kaseri" is made in Wisconsin, USA, but it is 75% 
cow milk and 25% sheep milk, or, in some cases 100% cow milk. This 
product is crumbly rather than fibrous.

<h3>Kefalograviera</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [PDO Western Macedonia, Epirus, 
  Aetolia-Acarnania and Evrytania]
<br><img src="img/cz_kefg02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Kefalogravoera Cheese"  class=mrg> 
<p>
This is a fairly hard, salty cheese, similar to Romano, Parmesan or 
Kefalotiri, made in Greece from sheep milk or sheep and goat milk.  
It is an excellent grating cheese and often used as a pasta topping.
Small wedges are also rolled in seasoned flour and lightly fried 
(Saganaki) as an appetizer. It melts somewhat reluctantly with lots 
of bubbling, and exudes a fair amount of oil. Purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2017 US $6.39 per 
pound. Ingred: Pasteurized sheep milk, bacterial culture, salt, 
rennet. Subst: If Kefalograviera is not available, Kefalotiri, Romano 
and Parmesan are recommended as substitutes in recipes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Kefalotiri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Kelle peynin (Turk); (Greece, 
  Cyprus - and elsewhere)]
<br><img src="img/cz_kefalo02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Kefalotiri Cheese"  class=mrg> 
<p>
This is a fairly hard, salty cheese, similar to Romano or Parmesan, 
made in Greece since the Byzantine era. It is made from a blend of 
sheep and goat cheese, aged for 2 to 3 months for young cheese, and a 
year or more for a harder, more strongly flavored cheese. If Kefalotiri 
is not available Romano and Parmesan are recommended as substitutes 
in recipes.</p>
<p>The photo specimen is actually a Danish imitation, made from cow milk, 
salt, culture, vegetable rennet. It softened but did not melt.

<h3>Manouri</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Greece  - Macedonia &nbsp; Thessalia)
<br><img src="img/cz_manou02h.jpg" alt="Manouri Cheese Disk"  width="220" height="177" class=mrg>
<p>
This mild white sheep or goat cheese is made from the whey left from 
the manufacture of feta cheese, similar to how Ricotta was made. It is 
soft and crumbly like feta but is creamier and a lot less salty. Heated 
it softens a bit and exudes a medium amount of oil, but holds its shape 
and browns to a tasty crust, so its a good frying cheese. Manori is used 
in salads, pastries, fried appetizers and deserts, where it can replace 
cream cheese. Typically pasteurized sheep milk, rennet, salt, water, 36% 
to 38% fat; 0.8% sodium. <u>Subst</u>: goat cheese. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Mizithra</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [(Greece  - Crete) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
  similar: Anan (Greece - Cyprus), also known as Nor (Cypriot Turkish) 
  or Lor (Turkish)] 
<br><img src="img/cz_myzith03h.jpg" alt="Myzithra Wedge"  width="220" height="168" class=mrg>
<p>
Locally, this is a simple fresh cheese, soft and sweet, made of raw goat 
and/or sheep milk and whey. It may be coagulated by rennet, lemon juice, 
vinegar, broken twigs from a fig tree, or whey from the previous batch, 
and is usually about 15% fat (dry weight). It takes the shape of the 
cloth bags it is drained in. It is usually drained for one or two days. 
It is used with honey as a desert, in various Meze dishes, in salads and 
in pastries, particularly as a filling in small "eat out of hand" pies. 
This soft form will not be found in the United States due to rules 
against importing unaged raw milk cheeses.</p>
<p>Some of the soft cheeses are rubbed with salt and hung up in bags to 
age, eventually becoming hard, dry, salty grating cheeses (as in photo) 
called Xynomyzithra (sour Myzithra). This dry cheese is very popular in 
Greece for grating over pasta. Heated, it doesn't even soften, never mind 
melt. The similar Cypriot Anan is also made in both soft and hard 
versions. The photo specimen was purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles for 2015 US $4.99 / pound. &nbsp; <b>Subst:</b> 
Mexican Queso Cotija, quite similar.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Vlahotiri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Greece]
<br><img src="img/cz_vlahot01h.jpg" alt="Wheel of Vlahotiri Cheese"  width="220" height="252" class=mrg> 
<p>
This is a firm cheese similar to Kefalograviera, but its holes are 
slightly larger, and its salt content slightly lower. It has good 
sheep milk tang. Small wedges are often rolled in seasoned flour and 
lightly fried (Saganaki) as an appetizer. It melts well with lots of 
bubbling, exudes a fair amount of oil, and toughens somewhat when cooled. 
Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) 
for 2018 US $10.79 per pound. Ingred: Pasteurized sheep milk, bacterial 
culture, salt, rennet; 30% fat.

<h2 id="nl">Europe - Holland / Netherlands</h2>

<p>The Netherlands is not the largest producer of cheese in Europe, but 
since 60% is exported, it is the largest exporter. A number of famous 
cheeses are made there in young, sliceable sandwich form as well as 
well aged cheeses to be enjoyed with beer.</p>

<h3>Beemster (XO)</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Extra Aged Gouda (Netherlands)]
<br><img src="img/cz_beemxo02h.jpg" alt="Cut Wedge of Beemster Cheese"  width="220" height="211" class=mrg>
<p>
This aged (26 months) Gouda is fairly hard and a bit crumbly. It has a 
very nice long aged tang It melts reluctantly but fairly smoothly exuding 
a lot of oil. It is made in wheels about 18 inches in diameter and 4-1/4 
inches thick. Pasteurized cow milk, salt, cheese culture, rennet, 
annatto, 36% fat.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Dutch Farmhouse Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Boerenkaas (Dutch)]
<br><img src="img/cz_dutchfh02h.jpg" alt="Cut Cube of Dutch Farmhouse Cheese"  width="220" height="178" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese is a form of Gouda that is made by a single farm, with 
unpasteurized milk from their own cows, thus is not common. It is 
generally more pungent than the industrially produced Gouda, and is 
shipped in gold wax rather than red. It is made in various ages. A long 
aged Boernkass is quite firm, and has developed crunchy crystals of 
denatured protein embedded in it. The photo specimen was lightly aged, 
creamy in texture, dense, pungent, and very flavorful. It melts smoothly 
exuding some moisture and <u>lots</u> of oil. It was purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $6.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Edam</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Edammer (Dutch), (Netherlands)]
<br><img src="img/cz_edam06h.jpg" alt="Cut Ball of Edam Cheese"  width="220" height="202" class=mrg>
<p>
This popular semi-hard cheese is most commonly sold as balls coated with 
red wax. It is made by the same warm washed curd process as Gouda, but is 
made from part skim milk rather than whole milk. It travels very well, 
making it the most popular cheese for ships and remote colonies from the 
14th to 18th centuries. It is sold both young, when it is mild, soft and 
sliceable, and aged, when it is much harder, tangier and somewhat 
crumbly. Edam is often paired with fruit. It melts well, exuding very 
little oil, and may be as little as 25% fat. The photo specimen of 
Aged Edam was cut from a "Baby Edam" ball 4-1/8 inches diameter 
(unaged would not have the darkening under the wax). It was purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) where baby and full 
size balls of both aged and unaged Edam are often to be found - 2018 US 
$9.70 / pound. Pasteurized milk, salt, cheese culture, enzymes, 
carotene (color).

<h3>Gouda</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Goudse kaas (Dutch), (Netherlands and 
  everywhere)]
<br><img src="img/cz_gouda03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gouda Cheese"  width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
<p>
Named for the Dutch city which had a monopoly on cheese trading in 
Medieval times, it designates more a style of cheese making than a 
particular cheese. It is a washed curd cheese, but washed with warm 
water rather then the cold water used for cottage cheese. It is aged 
from 4 weeks for sandwich / snack use to over 1 year for enjoying with 
good beer. The photo specimen was a relatively young Gouda made in 
Holland, firm and mild but with a distinctive flavor. It melted very 
smoothly, exuding rather little oil and did not become runny. 
Pasteurized cow's milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes, annatto. While 
the term "Gouda" is not controlled, "Noord-Hollandse Gouda" and 
"Boerenkaas" are tightly controlled.

<br><img src="img/cz_maast04h.jpg" alt="Cut Wedge of Maasdam"  width="220" height="189" class=mrg>
<p>
Very much like a good quality Swiss Emmental, but a little softer. This 
cheese is moderately tangy, melts smoothly exuding little oil, and has 
fairly large eyes. It was developed in 1984 to compete with the Swiss 
product, but be less expensive and faster to produce, aged for 4 weeks 
or a little more. It is now made by several companies in Holland. 
Pasteurized cow milk, salt, starter culture, rennet, 29% fat.

<p>
Subtitled "Italian Style", this is a fairly hard, gratable cheese with 
excellent aged flavor and crystalization scattered through. It has a lot 
more flavor, and more buttery flavor, than Italian equivalents. It melts 
reluctantly, but smoothly, exuding no oil at all. Purchased from a 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2021 US $6.99 / pound. 
Pasteurized cow milk, salt, cheese cultures, animal rennet, annatto.

This is a very firm cheese with excellent aged flavor. It was originally 
made only during the flax harvest (thus the name), but the Beemster Co. 
has revived the recipe and makes this cheese year round. It melts 
smoothly with moderate oil.  2013 US $4.29 / pound. Pasteurized cow milk, 
cheese cultures, rennet, salt, annatto.

A semi-hard cheese from the Dolomite mountains of Veneto. It is 
somewhat similar to Swiss Gruyere but more pungent and with a unique 
aroma. It is made from unpasteurized cow milk and aged 180 days, which 
gives it an amber colored edible rind. It melts very smoothly exuding 
moderate oil: 33.5% Fat. It can be used as a melting cheese or featured

<p>
This cheese was originally made from buffalo milk, but today it is also 
made from a mix of buffalo and cow milk, or just cow milk. It is made in 
the same manner as Mozzarella, with stretching for texture, then made up 
into balls about 1-1/2 inches in diameter, weighing just over 1 ounce 
and packed in plastic bags floating in whey. It is essentially the same 
as California Fresh Mozzarella, and the photo specimen is of the 
California product.

<p>
This mild, sweet, fairly pungent semi-soft cheese contains shavings of 
white truffle, giving it a unique flavor. It is made in 4-1/4 x 2-1/2 
inch balls and aged less than 60 days. Pasteurized Sheep Milk, salt, 
truffle 03%, rennet, milk enzymes. Purchased from a multi-ethnic

<br><img src="img/cz_cacio02h.jpg" alt="Roped Caciocavallo Ball"  width="220" height="241" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a stretched curd cheese, though not nearly as fibrous as 
Mozzarella - flavor and texture are similar to Provolone. It may be made 
of sheep milk but more commonly cow milk. Exact characteristics vary 
from region to region. The name, meaning "cheese on horseback" comes 
from two cheeses being roped together and hung over a peg to age, 
looking like saddlebags. Similar cheeses are described from Greece 
around 500 BCE. This cheese melts smoothly exuding little oil and is 
often shredded over pasta. The photo specimen was 1.17 pounds at 2014 US 
$3.99 / pound (special price). When I bought it, the checkout girl held 
it up and called to the next checkout girl, "Looks a lot like your

<br><img src="img/cz_fontinu02h.jpg" alt="Thick Slice of Fontina Cheese"  width="220" height="150" class=mrg>
<p>
This cow milk cheese, famous for meltability and use in fondue, is 
properly made in Italy. Within the European Union, the name, properly 
"Fontina Val d'Aosta", is protected to defined Italian regions. 
Imitations called "Fontina" are also made in North America and elsewhere 
outside the EU.</p>
<p>From Italy this cheese comes in two forms, most popularly as a 
semi-soft table and melting cheese with a distinct tanginess, and as an 
aged grating cheese.</p>
<p>American "fontina" is always of the soft variety. It is soft, almost 
spreadable and it melts smoothly and completely, exuding little oil, 
showing no stringiness and it cools soft and smooth without rubberiness. 
It has a distinct and pleasant flavor but not as much sharpness as the 
Italian.  The photo specimen was made in Michigan: pasteurized part skim 
milk, cultures, salt, enzymes.

<br><img src="img/cz_gorgon03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gorgonzola Cheese"  width="220" height="222" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the most famous Italian blue cheese, made from whole cows 
milk and blue mold. It is soft and crumbly but spreadable with good tang 
and blue flavor.  This cheese has been produced near Milan since CE 879, 
but didn't get it's blue mold until sometime after CE 1000. Today most is 
made in Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy. It is made with a 
bacterial starter and Penicillium glaucum and Penicillium roqueforti.</p>
<p>Two versions are made, differing with age (3 to 4 months). Gorgonzola 
Dolce (Sweet Gorgonzola) is aged less, and Gorgonzola Piccante 
(Gorgonzola Naturale, Gorgonzola Montagna) aged longer. It melts, though 
reluctantly, exuding only a little oil, and is added to some risottos, 
used in pasta sauces and as a topping on pizzas.

<h3>Gran Maso / Oro del Maso</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, Alt-Adige)
<br><img src="img/cz_granmas03h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Gran Maso Cheese"  width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
<p>
These cheeses are made the same as Grana Padano, except for the exact 
region from which the milk comes. Cow milk is used and the cheeses are 
aged for at least 12 months. It is a grateable cheese that melts 
reluctantly, exuding a lot of oil. What the exact difference is between 
Oro del Maso and Gran Maso I have not been able to determine. The 
photo specimen of Gran Maso was purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $5.89 / pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_granpad01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Grana Padano Cheese"  width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the best selling hard aged cheese in Italy, used for shaving 
or grating, depending on age. It is made from semi-skim cows milk and 
develops a somewhat granular texture as it ages. "Grana Padano" is 
6 to 16 months, "Grana Padano <i>oltre 16 mesi</i>" is 16 to 20 months 
and "Grana Padano Riserva" is over 20 months. Its manufacture is tightly 
controlled by a cheese cartel and it's made today very similarly to how 
it was made 900 years ago by monks in the Po valley. The photo shows a 
typical wedge of regular (mild) Grana Padano, and some melted gratings 
from it. It melts smoothly, releasing a fair amount of oil.

<p>
Produced in the Alpine region of Alto Adige, this cheese is cured in a 
bath containing herbs, spices, garlic and red wine, then mold ripened. 
It is coated with a hard wax which must be cut off. It has a complex 
flavor and moderate tang, and though it melts very well, exuding little 
oil, it is probably more appropriate as a cheese plate item. Ingred: 
pasteurized cow milk, salt, rennet, wine, spices; 29% fat. 2013 US 
$6.99 / pound (up to $22 / pound on the Internet).

<p>
This is the softest of the pecorino cheese family. It is made from the 
seasons first milk in March, thus the name, but it is not ready for 
sale until around August, after a two stage aging process.  Final aging 
is usually done in a sealed container, but it was traditionally wrapped 
in cardoon leaves. It is normally made in a domed cylinder shape weighing 
around 1.4 pounds.</p>
<p>This cheese is sometimes made with shavings of black truffle mixed in, 
and some makers include some cow milk. It is a very good cheese plate 
cheese, and In Tuscany is often served with walnuts, pears and honey. 
It has a very distinctive tang, similar to Pecorino Romano, but fresher, 
and much softer in texture. It melts very well, exuding moderate oil. 
2013 US $4.99 / pound. Pasteurized sheep milk, cheese cultures, rennet, 
salt.

<h3 id="mozz">Mozzarella</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;   (Italy - now everywhere)
<br><img src="img/cz_mozz02h.jpg" alt="Partial Ball of Mozzarella"  width="220" height="201" class=mrg>
<p>
This semi-soft fresh white cheese is kneaded and stretched after 
cheddaring to produce an elastic fibrous texture. It is very important 
in Italian recipes and used extensively in the U.S. as well. It 
originated in southern Italy.</p> 
<p>In Italy, traditional Mozzarella is made from buffalo milk, which is 
richer than cow milk. In the U.S. it's made from cow milk (our native 
buffalo aren't at all keen on being milked, and our water buffalo herds 
are still ramping up). In Italy, much is now made using a mix of cow and 
buffalo milk, and in the northern regions even all cow milk.</p>
<p>In Italy this is normally a fresh and very perishable cheese, unlike 
that of North America. It is usually intended to be used by the day after 
it is made, but, sealed in plastic with brine it can be refrigerated for 
as much as a week. Several versions are made.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mozzarella di Bufala:</b> &nbsp; [buffalo mozzarella] &nbsp; Made 
  from milk of Italian domesticated water buffalo. This is made mostly in 
  Campania and Lazio, with cow milk used elsewhere. Italians have 
  transplanted these buffalo to other countries, including the United 
  States.</li>
<li><b>Mozzarella fior di latte:</b> &nbsp; made from fresh cow's milk, 
  pasteurized or unpasteurized.</li>
<li><b>Low Moisture Mozzarella:</b> &nbsp; This made from whole or 
  skim cow's milk and is a longer lasting product than regular Italian 
  mozzarella. This is much like the mozzarella we are all accustomed 
  to here in North America, and is much used by the food service 
  industry in Italy.</li>
<li><b>Mozzarella affumicata:</b> &nbsp;  Smoked mozzarella, also quite 
  available here in North America.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Parmesan</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Parmigiano, (Italy, Wisconsin)]
<br><img src="img/cz_parmesan05h.jpg" alt="Parmesan wedge"  width="220" height="181" class=mrg>
<p>
The best known grating cheese, Parmigiano is the Italian name and Parmesan 
is French, but used in North America. Real Parmesan / Parmigiano is made 
in Italy and the name is a protected designation of origin. There are several 
regions allowed to use the Parmigiano name, with Parmigiano-Reggiano the 
most prestigious.</p>
<p>In Italy this cheese is made in 
a number of grades, ages and degrees of hardness. The minimum age is 12 
months and the normal maximum is 36 months but some goes for 48 months. In 
Italy this cheese is made from raw whole cow milk that must be from cows 
fed only on grass. A starter whey is added and the curds are coagulated with 
calf rennet</p>
<p>Quite serviceable versions or Parmesan for general culinary use are made 
in Wisconsin though tasteless dry pre-grated versions are also made there. 
North American Parmesan manufacture differs somewhat from that of Italy. 
Pasteurized milk may be used and milk may be from cows fed other than on 
fresh grass. Microbial rennet may be used and the curds are 
cut less fine and are mechanically pressed to remove moisture.</p>
<p>Parmesan melts reluctantly but well and does not become runny, but it 
does exude a fair amount of oil. It also grates very well. Always grate 
your Parmesan fresh just before use because quality rapidly declines

<h3>Pecorino Brigante</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, Autonomous Region 
  of Sardinia)
<br><img src="img/cz_pecbri02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Brigante Cheese"  width="220" height="196" class=mrg>
<p>
This sheep milk cheese, made in the north of the island of Sardinia, 
is semi-soft, smooth, creamy and a light ivory color. Aged about 3 
weeks, it has a light but distinctive sheep cheese flavor. It has a 
very thin waxy coating which does not peel easily and needs to be shaved 
off. It melts easily and smoothly, exuding a very modest amount of oil. 
Melting intensifies the flavor and makes the cheese a little more 
granular in texture. </p>
<p>Popular in Italy, this cheese can be used for cooking, but is also 
at home on the cheese plate. It has sufficient flavor to stand up to 
red wines. 2015 US $12.99 / pound. Pasteurized sheep milk, salt, animal 
rennet, netamycin (natural anti-fungal on rind, E235).

<h3>Pecorino Crotonese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, Calabria - Crotone)
<br><img src="img/cz_peccrot01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Crotonese Cheese"  width="220" height="229" class=mrg>
<p>
This partially cooked whole sheep milk cheese originates from the town 
of Crotone, located on the ball of the foot of the Italian boot, between 
the Gulf of Taranto and the Ionian Sea. It is made as both a lightly 
aged table cheese (180 days) and as a hard cheese for grating (about 
1 year). A mild fresh version aged for only 30 days is available in 
Italy. It is made in small thick wheels and has a natural rind with 
a pattern from the wicker baskets in which it is aged. It has a more 
"sheep milk" flavor than Pecorino Toscano. Some cheese sold under this 
name is said to be made in Sardenia and Lazio.

<h3>Pecorino Romano</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, PDO Tuscany)
<br><img src="img/cz_romanoital01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Romano Cheese"  width="220" height="192" class=mrg>
<p>
This sheep milk cheese has been made since the time of Imperial Rome, in 
fact it was part of the rations supplied to the Roman Legions. It is still 
made in the same manner. By law, this cheese must be curdled with rennet 
from lambs raised in the same region, so it is not vegetarian friendly 
(but imitations made in North America can be). With Parmesan, this is 
one of the two most important grating cheese used for pasta dishes.</p>

<p>Sharpness depends on aging. It is given 5 months for table cheese, 
but at least 8 months for grating cheese. American imitations are 
called "Romano" because the USDA does not require any pecorinos be 
involved, cows will do fine here. This cheese softens but does not 
melt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pecorino Toscano</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, PDO Tuscany, Umbria, 
  Lazio)
<br><img src="img/cz_pectosc01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Toscano Cheese"  width="220" height="158" class=mrg>
<p>
This sheep milk cheese, made since the time of Imperial Rome, is given a 
minimum of aging of 20 days, after which it is a good table cheese. It's 
characteristics change as it continues to mature, and at 4 months it 
becomes a grating cheese often used as a substitute for parmesan.  It 
is properly made of sheep milk, but American imitations are called simply 
"Toscano" because they're made out of cow milk - no pecorinos are 
involved. The photo specimen is American, from Trader Joe's.

<h3>Primo Sale</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy - Sicily, Sardenia)
<br><img src="img/cz_primos01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Primo Sale Cheese"  width="220" height="239" class=mrg>
<p>
This semi-soft sheep milk cheese is named "First Salt". Made fresh it 
called "Tuma". When it is removed from the mold, salted and aged about 
30 days, it is called "Primo Sale". Longer aged, it is called "Vastedda". 
It may be made plain, or may be flavored with black peppercorns or red 
pepper flakes. This is strictly a table cheese, so I didn't test it for 
melting. The photo specimen was purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $4.99 / pound.

<h3>Provolone</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy DOP Naples, P. Val Padana, 
P. Monaco)
<br><img src="img/cz_provaloni01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Provolone Cheese"  width="220" height="183" class=mrg>
<p>
This semi-hard cheese was developed in southern Italy in the 1890s, but 
the main manufacturing region now is Lombardi and Veneteo in northern 
Italy. Since 
production from only two specific locations are DOP, this cheese is 
widely made both in Italy and in other countries.</p>
<p>This is a "pulled curd" cheese like Mozzarella but not so obviously. 
Provolone varies from bland (Provolone Dolce) to fairly sharp 
(Provolone Piccante) depending on manufacture. The Dolce version is 
made with calf enzymes and aged 2 to 3 months. The Picante version is 
made with goat enzymes and aged 6 to 12 months. American provolone is 
of the Dolce variety.</p>
<p>Smoked versions are also made, and a smaller version called Provola.
This is a large sausage, pear or cone shaped cheese with a smooth 
firm texture, so it is a favorite for slicing for sandwiches and the 
like. It also melts well, exuding moderate oil, and tastes great melted.
Pasteurized part skim cow milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes, 
27% fat.  The photo wedge was from an Italian made slice 7-1/2 inches 
in diameter.

<h3>Quartirolo Lombardo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy)
<br>A semi-soft cheese made from whole cow milk. It has a pinkish rind that 
acquires reddish-gray molds with age and may be a little lumpy and crumbly 
in the center. It is most used with salads and cold meats. <p></p>

<h3 id="ricot">Ricotta</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy & everywhere)
<br><img src="img/cz_ricotta05e.jpg" alt="Lumps of Ricotta Cheese"  width="260" height="150" class=mrg>
<p>
This Italian cheese was originally made by heating the whey left over 
from making other cheeses (the name means "recooked") with a little 
milk added. This precipitated a couple of proteins not affected by the 
usual curdling method, but yield is low. Today it's "industrialized", 
either partly or completely. Whey proteins, skim milk, vinegar, 
stabilizer (xanthan, locust bean, and guar gums).</p>
<p>It's a soft cheese (sold in tubs) with a unique mild tang, and is 
used in many Italian recipes, especially for stuffing pasta. Heated it 
becomes very soft, but doesn't really melt. Sometimes it's called for 
as a substitute for <a href="da_cheesev.html#paneer">Paneer</a> in Indian recipes, but 
Mexican Panella is a better substitute in my opinion.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ricotta Salata</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Italy, North America)
<br><img src="img/cz_ricsal05h.jpg" alt="Diced Salata Cheese"  width="220" height="230" class=mrg>
<p>
This Italian cheese is made from <a href="da_cheesev.html#ricot">Ricotta</a> by salting, 
pressing, drying and aging.  It is more for visual and textural contrast 
than for flavor, because it has almost none. It is extremely mild, firm 
and dry, sort of an edible plaster. It does not melt at all, in fact it 
doesn't even soften. It's main use is topping salads and the like, 
because it is unaffected by dressings. In Italy it is made up in 
wheels or small loaves, often decorated with a basket pattern. The photo 
specimen, from Italy, was very firm and sliced very nicely, but flavor 
and salt were barely detectable. 2014 US $2.99.</p>
<p>I also tried Trader Joe's domestic version, pre-diced and crumbled 
for the yuppie salad trade (yuppies can't be bothered with dicing and
crumbling). Flavor was pretty much undetectable. Pasteurized whey, milk, 
vinegar, salt, cellulose (prevents caking), natamycin (preservative), 
21% fat, made in USA, 2103 US $7.97/pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_rbosina02h.jpg" alt="Slab of Robiola Bosina Cheese"  width="220" height="198" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese, made by Caseificio dell'Alta Langa in Piedmont, 
Italy, is a very soft, bloom rind cheese aged 1 month. It is similar in 
principle to French Brie, but much softer, nearly runny. It is made in 
blocks about 4 x 4 inches and 3/4 inch thick, weighing about 10-1/2 
ounces, from a mix of cow and sheep milk. This is a very rich, creamy 
cheese, fairly salty and with a unique tang from the sheep milk. It 
should be spread on neutral flavored crackers or similar. The only 
other way you could eat it is with a spoon, but it's just too intense 
to be alone. Pasteurized cow milk, pasteurized sheep milk, salt, rennet. 
Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2016 US 
$3.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Trugole</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Piedmont)
<br><img src="img/cz_trugol01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Trugole Cheese"  width="220" height="235" class=mrg>
<p>
This semi-soft cheese is made in Piedmont, Italy, and is similar 
to an Asiago Fresco. It is made in 30 pound wheels and aged 2 to 3 months. 
It has very good not quite mild flavor for the cheese plate, and also 
melts easily and smoothly, bubbling a little and exuding little oil.
Unpasteurized cow milk, pasteurized sheep milk, salt, rennet. 
Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2018 US 
$6.49 / pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_russ02h.jpg" alt="Thick Slice of Russian Cheese"  width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a fairly tangy semi-soft cheese that melts very well, exuding 
little oil. It is made in medium size wheels or blocks, and has a sort 
of sponge like texture, shot full of very small holes. Armenian Lori 
seems to be pretty much the same cheese.

<h3>Ukrainian Gold</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Latvia)
<br><img src="img/cz_ukraing03h.jpg" alt="Ukraine Gold thick slice"  width="220" height="195" class=mrg>
This is a little confusing, as it is titled "Ukrainian" and made in 
Latvia. It seems rather like the "Russian Cheese" sold around here, but 
many Russian style cheeses are made in Ukraine. Given hard feelings, the 
Latvians probably don't want to call anything they make "Russian". This 
is a fairly tangy semi-soft cheese that melts very well, exuding little 
oil. It has a sort of sponge like texture, shot full of very small holes, 
and is made in cylinders about 2-1/4 inch diameter weighing about 1-1/4 
pounds. The Lavada brand available here is shipped in bright orange 
shrink film. Ingred: whole milk, skim milk, enzymes, lactic culture, 
annatto, salt, calcium chloride, 52% fat (dry weight). Purchased at a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles at 2015 US $5.69 / pound.

<br><img src="img/cz_hunts03h.jpg" alt="Block of Hunter Cheese"  width="220" height="184" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese has an aged cheese tang, with an intense smoke flavor over 
it. It melts well and willingly, exuding a lot of oil, but is probably 
more a table cheese than a melting cheese. From Latvia, it was 
purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2015 
US $4.99 / pound. Ingred: whole milk, skim milk, enzyme, lactic culture, 
annatto, salt, calcium chloride, spices, artificial flavoring.

<h3>Lithuanian Curd</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Lithuania)
<br><img src="img/cz_curdl01h.jpg" alt="Crumbles of Curd"  width="220" height="226" class=mrg>
<p>
This curd is similar to cottage cheese, but with no evident moisture. I 
suspect it is used as stuffing in pastries as farmer's cheese might be. 
Heated it exudes some water, softens and sticks together in a slightly 
rubbery mass, but it does not actually melt. It is apparently shipped 
from Lithuania frozen. Pasteurized milk, potassium sorbate; 9% fat. 
2013 US $5.12 / pound.

<h3>Morski</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Poland)
<br><img src="img/cz_morski02h.jpg" alt="Block of Morski Cheese"  width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
<p>
This medium firm cheese is used in salads, sandwiches and as a table 
cheese. It slices well and can also be used in cooking, as it shreds 
easily and melts smoothly, exuding very little oil. In flavor and 
texture it resembles a cross between Swiss and a mild cheddar.  
Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Calcium Chloride, Bacteria Culture, Bacterial 
Rennet, Potassium Nitrate, Annato for color. The photo specimen was purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2017 US $6.49

<br><img src="img/cz_radamer02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Radamer Cheese"  width="220" height="234" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese was developed in 1991 and is the first Polish cheese 
with "eyes". It was made by combining Dutch methods which were normal 
in Poland with Swiss methods, resulting in color, flavor and texture 
between Swiss and Dutch cheeses. Very suitable for the cheese plate, it 
has become quite popular and has won a number of prizes in exhibitions. 
It melts slowly but smoothly exuding very little oil. Purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $5.99 /

Mlekovita, it is apparently not common. I've found no informatin on it, 
and all the information labels on the cheese itself were destroyed, except 
the names, "Non GMO", and the weight 300g (10.6 ounces). I did not test 
it for melting as it is clearly a table cheese.

actually very good, and has won prizes in Poland, seeming more flavorful 
than Greek examples. It was purchased in 4.2 ounce rounds from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $3.77 / pound.

<h3>Danish Blue</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Danablu, (Denmark)]
<br><img src="img/cz_danblu05h.jpg" alt="Danish Blue wedge"  width="220" height="218" class=mrg>
<p>
A semi-soft very crumbly (it can't be sliced) and rather salty white cow's 
milk cheese carefully prepared and cultured to be run through with blue mold 
which gives it a distinctive flavor and color. It is generally aged from 
2 to 3 months and is not a traditional cheese but an imitation Roquefort 
invented around 1910. Danish is softer than other blue cheeses such as 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#stilt">Stilton</a> and <a href="da_cheesev.html#gorgon">Gorgonzola</a> and the 
blue mold is more extensive and 
more uniform. Danish blue melts down to an oily green puddle that never 
solidifies so you want to use it where it will not be melted or only 
partially melted (example: inside French omelets)

A soft, triple cream blue cheese too sticky to be sliced. This is a 
spreadable cheese for use with crackers and the like. It is one of a 
number of cheeses marketed by the Danish company Castello (Aria Foods) 
and is highly thought of, having won numerous awards. Pasteurized cow's 
milk, cream, salt, cheese cultures, rennet, Penicilliam roqueforti,

<p>
A cow's milk cheese named for an experimental farm in Denmark where it was 
invented. It has very small "eyes", a smooth almost spreadable texture,  
a buttery taste and aroma and is a bit sweet. It is generally aged for 
about 3 months.  Suitable for slicing as a table cheese, grilling and 
melting, it melts smoothly and completely without stringiness, exudes 
only a little oil and cools soft with just a little rubberiness. I 
consider it a bit bland, though with a touch more flavor after melting - 
probably best slightly browned. Pasteurized cows milk, salt, cheese 
cultures, animal rennet.

<p>
Development of this large hole cheese, similar to Swiss Emmental, began 
in 1850, but it didn't go into volume production until the 1960s. 
During the '60s, it was sold so cheaply in the United States, it caused 
a major fair pricing action. Today it costs as much as other well known 
cheeses. It is an excellent substitute for good Swiss cheese, and melts 
quite well and evenly. The exact formula and method of manufacture is 
held as a trade secret.

Developed in the Lapland part of Finland, this cheese is somewhat similar 
to Swiss Emmenthal, but without the big "eyes" and being made with 
pasteurized milk. It is firm and mild, but not bland, and melts well, 
becoming a bit runny but exuding little oil. Milk, cream, salt, lactic 
acid culture, rennet, blue mold culture, white mold culture.

<p>
This semi-soft cheese from the Basque region of northern Spain is made 
from raw milk of Laxta and Carranza sheep. It is aged 2 to 10 months 
depending on the hardness and flavor desired, and is often lightly 
smoked. It has a very pleasant aged tang, strength depending on months 
of age. It melts very smoothly exuding very little oil, but is more a 
cheese plate cheese than a melting cheese. The photo specimen was

This cheese, from the island of Minorca off the Mediterranean coast of 
Spain, can be soft or hard depending on age. The photo specimen was 
semi-hard and grateable. It was tangy and buttery, melting smoothly 
while exuding a fair amount of oil. While this is a prime cooking cheese 
in Spain, it is also eaten as a table cheese. Traditionally, slices are 
topped with a sprinkle of olive oil, black pepper and tarragon.

<br><img src="img/cz_manch01h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Spanish Manchego"  width="220" height="212" class=mrg>
<p>
Probably the best known Spanish cheese, Manchego is firm with a 
buttery texture, which varies with age. Grades are "Fresco", aged 2 weeks, 
soft and mild and rarely seen outside Spain; "Semicurado", aged 3 weeks to 
3 months, semi-firm and mild; "Curado", aged 6 months, semi-firm and 
develops a sweet nutty flavor; "Viejo", aged 1 to 2 years, firm and 
sharp, both grateable and sliceable, often used as tapas.</p>
<p>Queso tipo manchego is made in Costa Rica and is quite similar.
Queso tipo manchego made in North America is not at all the same, more 
like Monterey Jack. The photo specimen was made in Spain, 2010 US 
$10.99/pound. It melted smoothly exuding a moderate amount of oil. 
Romano is suggested as a substitute.

<br><img src="img/cz_murav04h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Murcia Cheese"  width="220" height="213" class=mrg>
<p>
This goat cheese is made in Murcia, in southeast Spain, from registered 
herds. During maturing, the rind is washed with wine, thus the name. It 
is pressed into cylinders about 4 inches diameter (14 ounces) or  5 to 7 
inches diameter weighing 2.2 pounds to 4.4 pounds.  The smaller are aged 
about 30 days and the larger about 45 days, and are bathed in wine several 
times to suppress mold, but it doesn't penetrate the cheese. The cheese 
is rich and quite pungent, with a smooth, creamy, almost spreadable 
texture and some salt. It melts smoothly, with a fair amount of bubbling 
from moisture and exudes a fair amount of oil, but this is really a 
tapas cheese, not a cooking cheese. 2014 US $6.79 / pound. Pasteurized 
goat milk, animal rennet, cheese cultures, salt, lactic acid starter, 
calcium chloride, strong red Jumilla wine on rind only. 100 calories 
per ounce (30 gms), Fat 27%.

<p>
A mild, semi-soft cheese that has been moderately smoked. This DOP 
product is formed into a cone 5 inches high and 5 inches wide. Other 
queso ahumado are made in Spain in different shapes. We did 
not do a melt test because smoked cheeses are generally cheese plate 
items.   2013 US $4.39 / pound. Pasteurized cow milk, rennet, lactic

<h3>Quesixo Tetilla</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Spain - DOP / DO Galicia) 
<br><img src="img/cz_tetilla03h.jpg" alt="Cone of Tetilla Cheese"  width="220" height="282" class=mrg>
<p>
This cheese, made in the form of a shallow cone about 5-5/8 inch 
diameter and 4-5/8 inches high, weighs about 2 pounds 5 ounces. In the 
photo, the usual nipple at the top has been flattened by the packaging. 
The name means "Small Tit", but don't panic ladies, the comparison 
applies only to cheeses, you're fine. This is a rich cheese with an 
interesting tang. It's rather soft, but firm enough to be sliced. It 
melts very easily, exuding little oil, but when it cools it remains 
almost liquid. It is aged from 10 to 30 days, and may or may not have 
a rind.  Tetilla is prominent in Galician cuisine, and often used as 
a desert. It is made from milk of three specific breeds of cow and 
animal rennet, 25% fat. The photo specimen was purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles at a special sale price, 2016 US 
$4.99 per piece ($2.16 / pound).

<h3>Sansue&ntilde;a</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (Spain - Ciudad Sansue&ntilde;a, 
  Zamora) 
<br><img src="img/cz_lzam02h.jpg" alt="Cone of Sansuea Cheese"  width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a fairly hard aged sheep milk cheese from the Zamora region, 
with a good aged cheese flavor. It melts a bit reluctantly, exuding a 
lot of oil, and hardens when cooked, so this is better used as a cheese 
plate cheese.  2015 US $6.69 / pound. Raw sheep's milk, salt, rennet, 
cheese cultures, potassium nitrate, lysome (a natural anti-bacterial).
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Valde&oacute;n</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Spain - PGI Le&oacute;n)
<br><img src="img/cz_vald02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Valdeon Cheese"  width="220" height="239" class=mrg>
<p>
This is one of the two major Spanish entries into the field of blue 
cheeses. It seems similar to English Stilton, but 
whiter, creamier, less crumbly and has a thinner rind. It melts a bit 
better than most blue cheeses. Pasteurized cow and goat milk, cheese 
cultures, Penicillium roqueforti, enzymes, salt.

<h3>Emmental</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Swiss, Emmentaler; (AOC Emmentaler 
  Switzerland)
<br><img src="img/cz_swissementh01h.jpg" alt="Block of Emmental Cheese"  width="220" height="200" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the famous "Swiss Cheese" with big "eyes". It is a medium hard 
cheese originating from around the village of Emmental in Switzerland.
It is produced by a process involving three bacteria, the third of which 
produces the Carbon Dioxide responsible for the large "eyes". Until recent 
times this was considered a defect to be avoided as much as possible - 
today it is definitive of the cheese.</p>
<p>Traditionally made Emmental is sold at different ages: "Classic" 
(4 months), Reserve (8 months), and Premier Cru (14 months). The names 
"Swiss" and "Emmentaler" are not protected and this cheese is imitated 
worldwide. It is a fine table cheese, widely used sliced in sandwiches 
and tops many "gratin" dishes because it melts smoothly and browns 
nicely. It can be used for fondue mixed with Gruy&egrave;re cheese.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Gruy&egrave;re</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (AOC Switzerland)
<br><img src="img/cz_gru02h.jpg" alt="Block of Gruyere Cheese"  width="220" height="196" class=mrg>
Originating in the town of Gruy&egrave;res, this is the second most 
famous Swiss cheese. It is a medium hard cheese with a pungent tang which 
varies greatly with age. Varieties are "mild/doux", min 5 months, 
"reserve" min 10 months.
<p>This is a fine cooking cheese, used in quiche, onion soup and many 
other dishes, and in fondues in combination with Emmental. The photo 
specimen was from Switzerland, aged over 120 days, Raw part skim cow 
milk, cheese cultures, salt, animal rennet, 32% fat, 2013 
US $11.99/pound. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Raclette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Switzerland)
<br><img src="img/cz_racel01h.jpg" alt="Slices of Raclette Cheese"  width="220" height="181" class=mrg>
The name of this cheese is the same as the presentation it is served 
with. This is a grilled dinner, usually made at the table. The melted 
cheese is poured not on the other ingredients, but directly on the 
plate. The photo slices were cut to to fit the individual pans of a 
table-top electric grill called a "raclonette", now the most popular 
way to serve this dinner.
<p>This cheese is a nicely tangy Swiss type. It melts very well, exuding 
little oil. It was purchased at a large multi-ethnic market in Los 
Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $7.52 per pound. This is probably a low 
price as it was at expiry date (this market handles a lot of such 
cheeses, as they can sell them within hours). Pasteurized part-skim cow 
milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Sbrinz</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Swiss)
<br>A whole cow milk hard grating cheese aged at least two years. It has 
a dark yellow interior, a brownish-yellow rind and a rich mellow flavor. 
If it hasn't been aged the full 2 years it is called Spalen.
<p></p>

<h3>Spalen</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Swiss)
<br>A whole cow milk grating cheese same as Sbrinz but 
not aged as long.<p></p>

<hr class=hr4s>
<p></p>

<h2 id="ind">India</h2>

<p>India really has only one cheese, Paneer. This is the result of 
traditions forbidding food from being kept overnight - thus only a 
cheese that can be made in less than a day is acceptable. There are 
also religious strictures against the use of animal rennet, so only 
an acid curdled cheese is acceptable. Panner is not widely used in 
most of India because dairy products are very expensive there. Also, 
in the south, most of the population is lactose intolerant and must 
avoid unaged cheeses.</p>

<h3 id="paneer">Paneer</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [variously spelled]
<br><img src="img/cz_paneer01h.jpg" alt="Block of Paneer"  width="220" height="218" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a soft fresh whole milk cheese used in Indian cooking. You can 
make Paneer yourself quite easily. Milk is curdled with lemon juice. The 
curds are wrapped in cloth and the liquid pressed out. It is held in 
cold water for a couple hours, then pressed under a stone slab or similar 
heavy weight. </p>
<p>An important property of Paneer in Indian cooking is is that it doesn't 
melt. It holds its shape stubbornly when heated even to browning. This 
is also characteristic of American Hoop Cheese and Mexican 
<a href="da_cheesev.html#blanco"><b>Queso Blanco</b></a>, which makes a good substitute, 
though it is lightly salted.</p>
<p>Due to foreign influences (Persia in Gujarat and England in Bengal) 
some paneer is now cured into a semi-hard form, though the cure time is 
still short, 1 or 2 days. It is these firmer forms that are now sold 
as "Paneer" in North America, and the form in the photo.</p>

<h2 id="me">Near <small>&amp;</small> Middle East</h2>

<p>For our purpose here, "Near &amp; Middle East" includes Israel and 
the mostly Islamic region from the Eastern Mediterranean (Levant) through 
Persia (Iran). We do not include Turkey, which is more appropriately 
part of Europe.</p>

<h3>Ackawi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Akkawi (Arab); Akawi, Akawieh]
<br><img src="img/cz_acka02h.jpg" alt="Block of Ackawi Cheese"  width="220" height="196" class=mrg>
<p>
One of the oldest cheeses of the Mediterranean region, Ackawi originates 
from the ancient city of Acre, now located in the far northwest corner 
of Israel. It is a white brined cheese, but very firm compared to Feta. 
It's made usually from cow milk, but also sheep and goat. It is used 
primarily as a table cheese and often paired with fruit. Sold in shrink 
plastic and jars of brine, it is a very popular cheese, now made in 
Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus, as well as California.</p>
<p>This cheese melts reluctantly, but it does melt. The photo specimen 
was getting lightly browned on the bottom by time it flowed, and the 
melt has a very glossy surface. The photo specimen came from California. 
Pasteurized whole milk, cultures, natural butter flavor, non-animal 
rennet, salt.

<h3>Chilal / Majdouli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Chilal; Jibneh Shelal 
  (Syria); Syrian String Cheese &nbsp; | &nbsp; Majdouli, Majdole, 
  Majdoulleh, Tel Peynir]
<br><img src="img/cz_chilal02h.jpg" alt="Hank of Majdouli Cheese"  width="220" height="213" class=mrg>
<p>
These are apparently separate cheeses, but I have not found what the 
difference might be, due to inadequately precise information. I have 
seen both described with and without Nigella (Kalonji) seeds. Many 
descriptions call the seeds "black cumin", but that name is valid 
only in Bengal.</p>
<p>This form of cheese making was brought to Syria by Armenian refuges 
from the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Turks. Cheeses of this 
type are now made throughout the Levant and in Bulgaria and Hungary. 
Cow milk cheeses are pulled and stretched until they form yarns of 
very fine fibers. The yarns are then twisted into a hank, often called 
"braided". The hanks pull apart into yarns, and the yarns pull apart 
into hair-like fibers. They are usually served pulled into yarns. 
Separated yarns can also be found packed in brine in jars.</p>
<p>Compared to the Armenian string cheese made by numerous Armenian 
dairies here in Southern California, this cheese is hard and <u>very</u> 
salty, quite similar to the Chechil Cheese of Armenia and Georgia. 
It is packed in strong brine (vacuum pack or jar). Some suggest giving 
the strands a short soak in cold water to reduce the salt. Strands make 
an excellent salad topping, but this cheese doesn't melt well at all - 
it barely even softens, and exudes almost no oil. The photo specimen, 
Chilal made in Hungary, was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2015 US $5.69 per pound. Pasteurized cow 
milk, salt, milk protein, water, milk culture, microbial rennet, 
potassium sorbate, niasin; minimum 30% fat (dry weight). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Kefir Cheese</h3>
<br>This is a soft cheese that is tangy, creamy and dense.  It is 
made by coagulating milk using kefir, a culture of yeast and bacteria, 
without use of acid or rennet. It may then be cold strained or heated and 
then strained. A major use is for making Shanklish 
where the cheese is fermented and aged. See also Labne, usually subtitled 
"Kefir Cheese" in North America.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Labne / Labneh</h3>
<br><img src="img/cz_lebni04e.jpg" alt="Lumps of Labne Cheese"  width="260" height="133" class=mrg>
<p>
Usually subtitled "Kefir Cheese" in North America (thought the culture 
is a bit different), this is a very soft spreadable cheese popular in 
the Near East, particularly for spreading in sandwiches and the like. It 
has a sour tang very much like Yogurt, which stands to reason because 
it's essentially yogurt with the water squeezed out. If you need some 
for a recipe, you can make it just that way, wrap yogurt in clean muslin 
and squeeze the liquid out. Since it's not far from liquid to start with, 
lebni turns runny and bubbly when heated. Typically pasteurized milk, 
cream and enzymes. 
<br class=cll></p>


<h3>Nabulsi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Jordan, Palestine, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_nabulsi06h.jpg" alt="Nabulsi square"  width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
<p>
A smooth, dense white cheese flavored with ground mahlab seeds and 
mastic, and often with a sprinkling of nigella seeds (which may be called 
"black caraway: on the label). 
Quite firm with medium tang and moderately salty, it melts slightly when 
heated and exudes very little oil. In the Near East it is commonly made 
from sheep, goat or camel milk, coagulated with animal rennet, boiled in 
brine and put up in cans and jars. In California production it is generally 
made from whole cow milk and bacterial rennet, formed into slabs 1/2 to 3/4 
inch thick, cut into squares, boiled or steamed in brine and vacuum packaged 
in heavy plastic bags. Nabulsi is suitable as a table cheese, in sandwiches 
and in cooking.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="shank">Shanklish</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Shinklish, Shorke, 
  Surke; (Near East, Egypt)]
<br><img src="img/cz_shank01e.jpg" alt="Shanklish Cheese balls"  width="260" height="140" class=mrg>
<p>
These are cheese balls made with salt, chili and spices mixed into the 
cheese, then the balls are rolled in Zatar (a thyme based seasoning) 
or Aleppo pepper. In the Levant Kefir Cheese (a 
bacterial / mold coagulated cheese) is used. In Egypt 
Areesh Cheese is used. Shanklish may be soft or may 
be aged until very hard and pungent.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were a hard shanklish made of Kefir Cheese with 
salt, chili and spices mixed in, then formed into balls and rolled in 
Zatar. They were 2-1/2 inches diameter, weighed about 5-1/4 ounces each, 
and were dry, pungent and crumbly with a noticeable chili bite.
<br class=cll></p>


<h3>Syrian Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Syria, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_syrian01h.jpg" alt="Syrian wheel"  width="220" height="207" class=mrg>
<p>
This is probably patterned after the Charkassiye cheese of Syria. Like 
many other fresh "farmers cheese" type cheeses it softens when heated but 
does not melt, holding its shape even through browning. Made by Karoun 
Dairies in California, Pasteurized whole milk, cultures, non-animal 
Kosher rennet, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Touma / Village Basket Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Levant, 
California)
<br><img src="img/cz_touma02h.jpg" alt="Wedge of Touma Basket Cheese"  width="220" height="245" class=mrg>
<p>
Touma means "Village", It is smooth and somewhat elastic, with a light 
tang and light salt. Heated, it softens greatly, exuding no oil, but it 
does not really melt, and it doesn't brown well. The photo specimen 
is from Karoun Dairies, Sun Valley, California. Purchased from a large 
multi-ethinc market in Los Angeles (Altadena) the photo specimen was 
cut from a 6 pound loaf, sold at 2019 US 4.29 / pound. Pasteurized 
whole milk, calcium, natural flavor, salt, non-animal Kosher rennet.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Touma Chicago Cheese</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Levant, California)
<br><img src="img/cz_tchic02h.jpg" alt="Touma Chicago wheel"  width="220" height="203" class=mrg>
<p>
Touma means "Village", but how Chicago got involved (this cheese is 
sometimes called "Chicago style") I really don't know. It is one of 
a number of Touma (or Tooma) "basket cheeses" made here in Southern 
California and elsewhere. It is smooth and creamy, with a light tang 
and light salt. Heated, it softens greatly, exuding no oil, but it 
does not really melt, and it doesn't brown well. The photo specimen 
is from Karoun Dairies, Sun Valley, California. Pasteurized whole milk, 
cultures, non-animal rennet, salt. 2015 US $7.72 / pound.
