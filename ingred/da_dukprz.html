<p>
Preserved eggs are most commonly duck eggs but chicken eggs and 
quail eggs can also be used, but those available in North America are 
duck eggs, The duck eggs used are about the size of A U.S. jumbo size 
chicken eggs at around 2-1/4 ounces each.</p>
<p>Preserved eggs are available in markets serving East and Southeast 
Asian communities, generally individually wrapped and packed 6 pieces to 
a styrofoam block. In times long past (1960s) they were shipped packed 
in rice straw in huge glazed clay pots which, once empty, were sold at 
high prices in Chinatown art stores.</p>
<p>Eggs were traditionally preserved by coating with an alkaline slurry 
and allowing them to age for three months to a year. Various mixes of 
alkaline clay, ashes, quicklime and other materials have been used. Today 
commercial eggs are made using lye or sodium carbonate mixed with tea, 
salt and other materials. In China highly toxic lead oxide is sometimes 
used to speed the process, and other heavy metals have also been used, 
none of which are allowed in North America. As of 2016, things are still 
not under control in China, so make sure the preserved eggs you buy are 
from Taiwan.</p>
<p>The process converts the whites into a stiff gel, transparent and dark 
amber in color. The yolks are turned blue-green, jelly like on the outside 
and gooey at the center with a distinct sulphur / ammonia aroma. The 
shells remain nearly white with a light blue-gray tint.</p>

<p>These have often showed up on "most disgusting foods" discussions, 
but I recently served them at a party where no-one recognized them. 
They were very much liked, and a half dozen quartered eggs were quickly 
consumed. People asked where they could get them. Many Americans have 
eaten preserved egg without realizing it - it's the mysterious stiff 
dark translucent gel in the center of flaky buns sold in Chinese 
bakeries.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These are available in almost any market 
serving an East or Southeast Asian community. <u>Caution</u>: always 
check the package to see it is from Taiwan, "Taiwan Style" may not be 
enough. Heavy metals and other shady techniques to shorten processing 
time are still being used in mainland China (2016).</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; These aren't generally cooked, though they may 
be included in some baked goods. You shell them and eat them.</p>

<p><b>Serving:</b> &nbsp;  My favorite way of serving is to set a tiny 
bowl in the center of a plate. I put sushi ginger (pink pickled ginger) 
in the bowl and arrange egg quarters around it.</p>
