<h1>Eggs</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Our remote pre-human ancestors were doubtless quite skilled at stealing 
eggs from bird nests. Naturally they ate them raw because fire would 
not be available for millions of years. Today eggs are generally cooked, 
more or less, and may appear as feature items or supporting ingredients. 
There are, however, still plenty of raw egg enthusiasts around.</span>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Eggs</h2>

<p>If you intend to use eggs for recipes the USDA would call "undercooked" 
(and most of the best recipes are), you should be particularly careful 
of the egg safety points listed here. See the <a href="da_eggs.html#safe"><b>Egg 
Safety</b></a> section for additional details.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Buy:</b> &nbsp; eggs only from a source where you can be confident 
  the storage temperature has been maintained below 45&deg;F/7.2&deg;C 
  from farm to you. Eggs must be transported in refrigerated trucks.</li>
<li><b>Buy</b> eggs from a source with good turnover so they will be as 
  fresh as possible.</li>
<li><b>Storage:</b> &nbsp; Raw eggs will keep in the refrigerator for 4 
  to 5 weeks but will lose moisture increasing the size of the air pocket. 
  Old eggs will float high when boiled.</li>
<li><b>USDA Graded</b> eggs must have a date indicating when they were 
  washed and packed. This is a three digit date starting at 001 on 1 Jan 
  and incrementing to 31 Dec. "Sell by" dates are not required but if 
  there is one it must be no more than 45 days from the "packed" date.
  </li>
<li><b>USDA Inspection</b> is for size and condition. It has no bearing on 
  the safety of the eggs, and a "B" egg is just as safe as an "AA" egg. 
  It all depends on the producer's facilities and handling.</li>
<li><b>Refrigerate</b> eggs immediately at 40&deg;F/4.4&deg;C or lower in 
  the coolest part of the refrigerator (never the door). They should never 
  be unrefrigerated for more than 2 hours.</li>
<li><b>European Eggs:</b> &nbsp; In Europe eggs are sold unwashed and are 
  stored at room temperature protected by the waxy coating the chicken 
  applies. American eggs are washed, sanitized and coated with mineral oil 
  to replace the waxy coating. After washing they must be refrigerated 
  until used. Because of the 1 in 10,000 possibility of an egg containing 
  some salmonella bacteria, refrigeration of unwashed eggs is highly 
  recommended.</li>
<li><b>Fertile Eggs</b> &nbsp; have no detectable nutritional benefit over 
  standard sterile eggs but they are sold at higher prices as "health 
  food".</li>
<li><b>Organic Eggs</b> that are carefully produced and handled just plain 
  have to be better for you than industrial eggs. Unfortunately it is 
  difficult to verify safe handling, especially from smaller producers.
  </li>
<li><b>Brown or White?</b> &nbsp; There is no detectable difference. Yolk 
  color varies depending on the hen's diet.</li>
<li><b>Blood Specs</b> on the yolk are not a problem and indicate 
  freshness - they fade with time.</li>
<li><b>Hazy Whites</b> are not a problem and indicate freshness. Whites 
  become clearer with age as carbon dioxide is lost through the shell.
  </li>
<li><b>Storage:</b> &nbsp; Hard boiled eggs can be kept refrigerated for 
  no more than 7 days. Separated egg whites and yolks for 4 days.</li>
<li><b>Araucuna chickens</b> from South America lay light green or light 
  blue eggs. Anything the least bit different (and more expensive) gets 
  promoted as "health food" these days, but claims these eggs are lower 
  in cholesterol have not been confirmed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties of Egg</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Chicken Eggs</h2>
<br><img src="img/da_eggchk01e.jpg" alt="Chicken Eggs" class=mrg>
[<i>Gallus gallus</i>]
<p>American chickens lay about 66 billion eggs per year in commercial 
production (yes, that's a "b"). In North America the word "egg" without a 
qualifier means a chicken egg, and if a size is not given presume "Large". 
Baking recipes in particular should be specific about size.

<p><h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; For poached eggs, omelets and fried eggs, 
you want the freshest eggs you can lay your hands on, and grade AA is 
best. For other cooking methods it doesn't much matter. You may hear 
that eggs held in the fridge for a week or so peel easier when hard 
boiled, but my experience, and actual testing by others, have disproven 
that. For details of the tricky business of boiling and peeling chicken 
eggs, see our 
<a href="../recipes/gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> page. 
For omelets, see our 
<a href="../recipes/fbd_omelet1.html"><b>French Savory Omelets</b></a> 
recipe. For poaching eggs see our 
<a href="../recipes/gbd_eggpoach1.html"><b>Poached Eggs</b></a> recipe.
<p></p>

<p>Please understand that the USDA grading is for size and internal and 
external condition. It has nothing to do with nutrition (all grades are 
the same there). It also has little to do with salmonella infection or 
other safety issues and nothing whatever to do with the safety, 
sanitation or condition of the egg production facility. Eggs sold by 
small producers may be marked "unsized, ungraded" because of the expense 
of USDA compliance, which is strictly voluntary. With storage, eggs will 
loose weight and also drop from AA to A and then B and even lower.</p>

<h3>Grades & Sizes:</h3>
<p></p>
<table>
<tr><td class=spc></td>
<td class="top"><b>AA:</b></td><td>Thick firm whites and a round yolk, 
  clean, no cracks or stains. Note: Jumbo eggs are never AA for technical 
  reasons, but Extra Large can be.</td>
  </tr>
<tr><td></td>
  <td class="top"><b>A:</b></td><td>Reasonably firm whites, otherwise 
  same as AA. Jumbo eggs should be grade A.</td>

<tr><td></td>
  <td class="top"><b>B:</b></td><td>Thinner whites and wider yolks, no 
  cracks but may have slight staining. These are sold mostly to food 
  processors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Size is not by the individual egg, but by the weight of a dozen eggs 
in a carton (weight of carton removed). Most commercial packaged eggs are 
rather uniform in size, except Jumbo, which has no upper limit. I have 
bought cartons of Jumbo eggs which were mostly unusually large double 
yolk eggs.</p>

<h3>Other designations</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Natural:</b> &nbsp; This designation is almost totally 
  meaningless. All eggs are "natural", they come out of the rear end of 
  a chicken. The USDA requires the label to explain what you mean by 
  "natural".</li>
<li><b>Free Range / Cage Free:</b> &nbsp; Eggs from chickens not confined 
  to battery cages, but free to roam around inside a warehouse. They may 
  have access to an outside area of undefined size, but may never go 
  outside. Commercial chickens are bred to like a crowded environment 
  and may be uncomfortable going outside.</li>
<li><b>Certified Organic:</b> &nbsp; These are eggs from "Free Range" 
  chickens that have been fed an entirely "certified organic" vegetable 
  diet with no meat byproducts. They must be free of antibiotics and 
  pesticides. There is USDA enforcement for this designation.</li>
<li><b>Certified Humane:</b> &nbsp; A further expansion of "Free Range", 
  requiring lower stocking densities and forced molting is forbidden. 
  This designation is verified by third party auditors, not the USDA.
  </li>
<li><b>Omega-3-Enhanced:</b> &nbsp; These are eggs from chickens fed 
  a diet high in Omega-3 fatty acids. They are produced to satisfy the 
  "health conscious" who seek benefits from Omega-3 (at a higher price, 
  of course). Despite all the hoop-la, the benefits of Omega-3 are still 
  rather uncertain, and at certain levels may be dangerous. AB tests 
  have shown they taste just like regular eggs.</li>
</ul>  

<h2 id="duck">Duck Eggs</h2>
<br><img src="img/da_eggduck03e.jpg" alt="Duck Eggs" class=mrg>
Responding to demand from a rapidly expanding Asian population, duck eggs 
are becoming quite common in North America. Naturally California is a 
leading producer because hundreds of Asian markets are close at hand. 
California duck eggs are considerably larger than those we see imported 
from Asia, running around 3-5/8 ounces, 2 inches diameter and 2.9 inches 
long vs. about 2-5/8 ounces. The jumbo chicken egg on the right weighs 
2-1/2 ounces.<p></p>
<h3>Caution</h3>: &nbsp;  When buying Duck Eggs, be careful, Fresh, 
Raw Salted, and Boiled Salted may look exactly the same - California 
salted duck eggs are not dyed red, as in the Philippines. Check the 
sign <u>and the label</u> so you get the kind you want. 
Also, <a href="da_eggs.html#balut"><b>Balut</b></a> look exactly the same, and you 
probably don't want those.<p></p>
<p>Duck eggs hard boil just fine using the same instructions as for 
chicken eggs (see links above), but the shells are much stronger. The 
yolks are a bit richer but they are otherwise interchangeable with 
chicken eggs, weight for weight.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Quail Eggs</h2>
<br><a href="da_quailz.html">
<img src="img/da_eggquail03e.jpg" alt="Quail Eggs" class=mrg></a>
High demand for quail eggs began in North America with the spread of 
Japanese sushi bars (uni with a raw quail egg broken over it made as 
gunkan nigiri sushi is one of my favorites), but they are also 
appreciated by other Asian communities. The photo specimens averaged 
0.47 ounce, 1.47 inches long and 1.1 inches diameter.
<p>The specked quail eggs found in markets here are generally from a 
Japanese quail variety now widely raised for egg production. The photo 
specimens came from Ontario, California. Some quail native to North 
America and Europe lay white eggs but those quail are raised mainly 
for eating, not egg production.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Goose Eggs</h2>
<br><img src="img/da_egggoose01e.jpg" alt="Goose Eggs" class=mrg>
While many geese are raised in North America, you're not likely to find 
goose eggs in your local markets unless you live next door to a goose 
farm. They are considerably larger than duck eggs, pointier than most 
eggs and may be white or colored.
 &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0038</a>.</small>
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Ostrich <small>&amp;</small> Emu Eggs</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [<i>Struthio camelus</i> / <i>Dromaius novaehollandiae</i>]
<br><img src="img/da_eggostr01e.jpg" alt="Ostrich Eggs" class=mrg>
<p>
The ostrich is native to Africa but is now farmed worldwide. Ostrich eggs 
are very large, around 6 inches long, weigh around 3 pounds and the shells 
are exceedingly hard and thick to prevent animals from breaking into them. 
While ostriches are farmed in North America, their eggs are not commonly 
available here.
 &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0037</a>.</small>
</p>

<p>Emus, native to Australia, lay a slightly smaller egg generally 
colored a greenish black with a shell a little softer and easier to carve 
than the ostrich egg. Emus aren't farmed as much in North America as the 
ostrich, though they are friendly and playful. As with ostrich eggs, emu 
eggs are sold in North America mainly for engraving and crafts rather 
than for eating.</p>

<p>Rheas (native to South America) and Cassowaries (Australia and New 
Guinea) are other large birds related to the ostrich but rheas are too 
dangerous and unfriendly to be popular and cassowaries are listed as 
endangered.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Turtle Eggs</h2>
<br><img src="img/da_eggturt01h.jpg" alt="Turtle Eggs" class=mrg>
Sea turtles lay their eggs on land, buried in sand and left to be 
incubated by the sun. These leathery shelled eggs have been eaten since 
prehistoric times but are no longer on the menu due to the endangered 
status of sea turtles. Serious fines and possible imprisonment apply to 
posession, transportation or consumption of sea turtle eggs. The eggs in 
the photo were gathered in Brazil as part of a conservation effort.

<br><a href="da_dukprz.html">
<img src="img/da_eggpres01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Sliced Preserved Eggs" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Preserved eggs are most commonly duck eggs but chicken eggs and 
quail eggs can also be used, The duck eggs used are about the size of 
U.S. chicken eggs at around 2-1/4 ounces each.</p>
<p>Eggs were traditionally preserved by coating with an alkaline slurry 
and allowing them to age for three months to a year. Various mixes of 
alkaline clay, ashes, quicklime and other materials have been used. Today 
commercial eggs are made using lye or sodium carbonate mixed with tea, 
salt and other materials.</p>
<p>The process converts the whites into a stiff gel, transparent and dark 
amber in color. The yolks are turned blue-green, jelly like on the outside 
and gooey at the center with a distinct sulphur / ammonia aroma. The 
shells remain nearly white with a light blue-gray tint.

These are popular appetizer eggs made in the home or sold by street

regular hard boiled eggs - and more flavorful. You can easily make them 
yourself from regular North American chicken eggs (and yours will be lead 
free). Recipe for

<img src="img/da_eggsalt01e.jpg" alt="Salted Eggs" class=mrg></a>
<p>
These can be either duck eggs or chicken eggs, with duck eggs 
preferred (less breakage, richer flavor). They are made by a similar 
method as <a href="da_dukprz.html"><b>Preserved Eggs</b></a>, but 
coated with salt mixed with clay or charcoal rather than alkali. They 
may also be made by soaking in a saturated salt brine.</p>
<p>Salted eggs are popular in China, the Philippines, Vietnam and 
Thailand, so can be found in markets serving those ethnic communities. 
You can make them yourself fairly easily using the saturated brine 
method. California producers just put them up in mesh bags looking 
exactly like their fresh eggs - <u>read the label</u>. This important 
and complex subject now has its own page, 
&nbsp; <a href="da_eggsltz.html"><b>Salted Eggs</b></a>.

<h2 id="balut">Balut - Feathered Eggs</h2> &nbsp;

  tea khon (Cambodia); Maodan (China)]
<br><img src="img/da_eggduck04h.jpg" alt="Duck Egg" class=mrg>
<p>These are fertile duck eggs incubated for 16 days to develop the 
embryo. This method of eating eggs originated in China (where else) but 
is now particularly popular in the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia.  
California, never slow to recognize a market, produces these egg 
commercially for our rapidly expanding Southeast Asian communities 
(<a href="da_eggs.html#e02">E2</a>).</p>
<p>I will spare you the detail pictures, but if you really want to see 
them you can find some at Wikipedia 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(egg)"><b>Balut_(Egg)</b></a>. 
In Asia these are rarely sold uncooked, but in North America they are 
often sold raw. Use the instructions for 
<a href="../recipes/gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> for 
hard boiling these eggs.</p>
<p>These eggs are most often served as "appetizers" though they have 
recently appeared in other dishes in the Philippines. Serve with a little 
salt or a chili / vinegar dip - and plenty of beer. Many of us will need 
to start with the plenty of beer before getting to the eggs.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Nutrition <small>&amp;</small> Health</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Eggs are a high protein food, and their 
protein mix is so good it is the standard by which other protein 
sources are judged. They did get a bad reputation from vilification by 
the American Heart Association claiming their high cholesterol would clog 
your arteries. That campaign was based on incomplete studies and faulty 
science and has been largely discredited. For a nutritional breakdown 
see <a href="da_eggs.html#e07">Note-E7</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Cholesterol:</h3> &nbsp; Some years ago the American 
Heart Association vilified eggs as being high in artery clogging 
cholesterol and strongly recommended against eating them (they allowed 
maybe two a week if you wanted to live dangerously). This caused a 
decline in egg consumption in North America.
<p>They have had to back off on the shrillness but still recommend 
against eggs (these people won't even admit they were wrong promoting 
trans fats). The truth is, nearly all cholesterol is manufactured within 
the body (it's essential for brain function, etc.) and most people absorb 
very little from dietary sources.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that for increases in total cholesterol from 
dietary sources HDL and LDL increase simultaneously, so the net impact 
on heart disease is statistically negligible.</p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg id="safe">Egg Safety:</h2>

<p>The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) warns that all eggs 
should be cooked to 160&deg;F/71&deg;C. Unfortunately this temperature is 
<u>utterly</u> <u>ruinous</u> for a great many famous egg recipes, 
including hollandaise, mayonnaise, poached eggs, coddled eggs, omelets, 
eggs "sunny side up", and even properly scrambled eggs.</p>

<p>Many of us simply can't accept ruined eggs - <u>so what is the actual 
risk</u>?</p>

<p>The US Department of Agriculture found, in 2002, that about 1 egg in 
30,000 (some think 1 in 20,000) U.S. hens have produced may have been 
infected with Salmonella bacteria. This doesn't mean it'll make you sick, 
even if you gulp the egg down raw, but it does mean proper temperature 
control must be maintained from hen to stove. This bacteria multiplies 
rapidly at temperatures above 40&deg;F/4.4&deg;C.</p>

<p>Efforts are being made to completely eliminate salmonella from 
American egg production, but this has proved to be regional. Egg 
producers in "over regulated" California (where many "undercooked" 
egg dishes are extremely popular), have almost totally eliminated 
salmonella through use of sealed, sanitary facilities, testing and 
general diligence.</p>

<p>That is clearly not the case in "business friendly" Iowa, where in 
August, 2010, filthy, maggot and vermin infested conditions at two major 
high volume egg facilities forced recall and destruction of 550 million 
eggs. More than 1300 cases of salmonella were reported from Iowa eggs 
(but no deaths). This reflects very badly on Federal food and facility 
inspection programs in some states.</p>

<p>There have been no studies as to whether small farms and organic 
growers produce a safer or less safe egg in regard to salmonella than 
the industrial producers, but at least in Iowa you don't need a study 
to tell you.</p>

<p>Infections from home cooked eggs have been almost nonexistent - 
infections have almost always been from institutional sources 
(restaurants, health care and elderly care establishments). These 
establishments use "egg pooling" where a number of eggs are mixed 
together and ladled out of the pool for use. Pooling eggs tremendously 
magnifies the risk of infection from outside sources, the possibility 
of unsafe temperatures, and errors in handling.</p>

<p>For institutional use, pasteurized egg products are recommended by the 
USDA and CDC. These products are held at 140 &deg;F for a specific time, 
a temperature that eliminates salmonella, but does not cause egg whites 
or yolks to coagulate. </p>

<p>For healthy adults the <a href="da_eggs.html#buy"><b>Safe Handling</b></a> rules 
at the top of this page should be sufficient to prevent illness, but 
those who feel they must be extra cautious can purchase "pasteurized in 
the shell" eggs in some regions of the country (I haven't seen them 
here in California). These do cost about twice what regular eggs cost.
</p>

<p>Despite all measures in place and being implemented, it is 
recommended that "undercooked" eggs <u>not be served</u> to infants, very 
small children, pregnant women, frail elderly people or those who have a 
compromised immune system. In particular small children can be sickened by 
an amount of Salmonella that would cause no problem at all in a healthy 
adult.</p>
