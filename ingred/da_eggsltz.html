These can be either duck eggs or chicken eggs with duck eggs preferred 
(less breakage, richer flavor). They are made by a similar method as 
<a href="da_dukprz.html"><b>Preserved Duck Eggs</b></a>, but coated 
with salt, mixed with clay or charcoal rather than alkali. They may also 
be made by soaking in a saturated salt brine. The photo shows a 
Philippine salted duck egg wrapped in red plastic, a Philippine salted 
duck egg cut in half, and at the top, a California salted duck egg, 
quite a bit larger than Asian imports.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Salted eggs are very popular in China, the 
Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand, so can be found in markets serving 
those ethnic communities. Commercial salted duck eggs from the 
Philippines are often dyed red or wrapped in red plastic, while salted 
chicken eggs (not much seen here in California) may be dyed blue or 
green.<p></p>

<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; When buying Duck Eggs, be careful. California 
Fresh, Raw Salted, and Cooked Salted, duck eggs look exactly the same. 
Check the sign <u>and the label</u> so you get the kind you want. 
California <a href="da_eggs.html#balut"><b>Balut</b></a> also look 
exactly the same, and you probably don't want those, but the high 
price is a tip-off.<p></p>

<h3>Cooked Salted Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Imported salted eggs are already 
cooked, much easier to ship that way. California salted duck eggs are 
also most often cooked, but raw are available. Cooked Salted Eggs are 
practically impossible to shell neatly, but this doesn't matter, they 
are always chopped for recipes, Many recipes use only the rich oily 
yolk and the almost flavorless whites are often discarded. Integrity 
and color of the yolk depends on the exact salting process, but they 
should be quite dark.<p></p>

<h3>Raw Salted Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; These are produced in California for 
recipes requiring them, for which cooked salted eggs are entirely 
unsuitable. The Yolk is yellow and stiff, while the white is almost 
clear and completely liquid. The yolk may be broken into small pieces, 
and the egg stirred into soups, as as is done with regular eggs for 
Egg Flower Soup.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; To cook raw salted eggs, put them in water to 
cover and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling turn down the 
heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, 15 for Chicken eggs.  These eggs 
are often impossible to peel neatly, but that's not really a problem 
since they're generally chopped up as a flavoring ingredient and the 
yolks are often crushed as a topping for rice.<p></p>

<h3>Making Salted Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Duck eggs are preferred, but Chicken 
eggs will work - yolks will be slightly less rich. Basically, you simply 
boil water with enough natural sea salt, pickling salt, or Diamond 
Crystal kosher salt to make a saturated solution. Cool the solution well. 
Place your eggs in a jar, making sure none have any cracks. Pour the well 
cooled solution into the jar of eggs, including all salt crystals. Make 
sure all are completely covered. Let sit in a cool place for about 4 
weeks. We will have more detail on this soon.<p></p>
