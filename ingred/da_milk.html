<span class=bg>Milk, other than mother's milk for infants, is relatively 
new in the human diet, and the people of many cultures are still not at 
all able to digest it as adults. Among the people of milk drinking 
cultures, there are still some individuals who cannot digest it.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>In the Western World, milk and milk products are very 
popular with Lacto and Ovo-lacto Vegetarians, but be aware - you can't 
be an "Ethical Vegetarian" and consume milk or milk products. See our

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Mammals feed their young with secretions from the mammary glands, for 
which they are named. The evolution of these glands is currently very 
uncertain, as fossil evidence of such soft tissues is largely not 
preserved. These complex and nutritious secreted fluids are called 
"Milk".</p>

<p>Milk is a new element in the diet of adult humans, beginning only 
8 to 10 thousand years ago, when several milk producing beasts were 
domesticated. This was done by successive selection and breeding by over 
a great many generations. Goats may have been first, followed by sheep 
and then cattle. These beasts are genetically different from their wild 
precursors, and they would be of very questionable viability returned 
to the wild.</p>

<p>Animals, including humans, lose their ability to produce the enzyme 
lactase, necessary to digest lactose in milk, upon being weaned from 
their mother's milk. The ability to retain lactase production into 
adulthood was evolved in the harsh environment of nomadic herding 
societies in temperate regions, and does not exist in arctic or 
tropical cultures.</p>

<p>The fat, enzyme and microbial makeup of animal milk differs 
significantly from human mother's milk. As evidence of the effects of 
these differences, as well as social effects, has accumulated, the 
trend away from breast feeding human babies has been reversed. Even 
doctors of conventional medicine now recommend it.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties of Milk <small>&amp;</small> Milk Products</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="milk">Milk</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Cow squeezings; Leche (Spanish)]
<br><img src="img/da_cowmlk02c.jpg" alt="Small Bottle of Milk" class=mrg>
<p>
In North America, we are most familiar with milk from cows, but it 
is also obtained from water buffalo, goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, 
camels, moose, reindeer and yaks, depending on region. Many regions of 
the world are not at all suitable for herding cattle. Of course, the 
nutritionally ideal milk for feeding human infants is from human 
females, particularly the milk provided right after birth which 
transfers antibodies and growth factors from the mother.
</p>
<p>Dairy cattle have been selected and bred for very high milk 
production, far more than would be produced in nature, 8 to 10 gallons 
a day.  They are pretty much dependent on humans to milk them twice a 
day or they will be in pain.</p>
<p>Milk is a very complex substance, composed of water, proteins (3.3%), 
particularly caseins, carbohydrates (4.9%), particularly Lactose, Fats 
(3.4%), over 400 fatty acids, a wide selection of vitamins, both water 
and fat soluble, minerals, and a selection of enzymes (percentages 
are for cow milk).</p>
<p>The fats can be separated from the milk as cream, either partially 
or entirely - or the milk can be homogenized to incorporate all or part 
of the fat inseparably into the milk. The proteins and carbohydrates 
can be separated out to form cheese.</p>
<p>Milk can be pasteurized with heat to sterilize it, with consequent 
loss of nutrients (see <a href="da_milk.html#health"><b>Nutrition &amp; 
Health</b></a>). Milk from pastured cows can be expected to be 
significantly more nutritious than milk from factory fed cows.

   <h3>Buttermilk</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_mbutter03h.jpg" alt="Dish of Buttermilk" class=mrg>
   In the traditional method of making butter, after churning, the whey 
   drained off from the solid butter is called "Buttermilk". Because the 
   cream would have been gathered from several days milkings it would 
   have become somewhat sour from fermentation. Today, most buttermilk 
   is made by processes designed specifically for sale as buttermilk. 
   Buttermilk is a common ingredient in pancakes and baked goods.
   Ingredients for a local "all natural" brand: milk, nonfat 
   milk, culture, salt.    
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Condensed Milk</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_mcond03h.jpg" alt="Dish of Condensed Milk" class=mrg>
   This product is so viscous it is barely pourable, and it tastes 
   like liquid caramel candy - which is what it is. It is made of milk 
   clarified to remove impurities, standardized to a specific fat 
   content, heated to about 190&deg;F/88&deg;C and evaporated to around 
   60% volume. Sugar is then added to about 45% by weight. This very high 
   sugar content protects the milk from spoiling, making cans of this 
   product shelf stable for years.
   <p>While it first became popular as field rations during the 
   American Civil War, it is now much used as an ingredient in 
   deserts and sweets. In various regions it is also used as a spread 
   on bread and quite widely as an ingredient in coffee and tea.    
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Evaporated Milk</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/da_mevap03h.jpg" alt="Dish of Evaporated Milk" class=mrg>
   This product is similar to condensed milk, but made by a somewhat 
   more complex process because without sugar it's more perishable. 
   It is lighter in color and tastes considerably more like milk.
   After evaporation it is about half the volume of the milk it is made 
   from. It is then homogenized, canned and sterilized with heat. The 
   heat gives it a slightly caramelized flavor and a slightly darker 
   color than fresh milk.
   <p>This product was very popular before refrigeration was widespread 
   as it has an acceptable shelf life at room temperature. Today it is 
   used mostly for baked goods and deserts in the West, and used in 
   tea in Singapore and Malaysia. It should be used in less than a 
   year after canning.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Powdered Milk</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Dry milk, Instant milk] 
   <br><img src="img/da_mdry02h.jpg" alt="Mound of powdered milk" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This product is made by evaporating milk, which may be whole, skim 
   or non-fat, down to 50% solids, then spray drying it into a light 
   dry powder which, in a sealed container, has a very long shelf life.
   It's nutritional content is comparable to liquid milk, but it does 
   have a higher content of oxysterols, which are thought to encourage 
   formation of arterial plaque.</p>
   <p>Powdered milk is used in various baked goods and confections where 
   adding liquid milk would add too much water. It is also popular with 
   hikers due to its low weight and survivalists due to its long shelf 
   life. In the motion picture industry it is used as a prop in place 
   of real cocaine to assure their actors are still functional after 
   snorting it.</p>

<h2 id="cream">Cream</h2>
<br><a href="da_creamz.html">
<img src="img/da_cream02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Cream" class=mrg></a>
This is the butterfat in the milk, which can be skimmed off after 
unhomogienized milk has been allowed to stand, or, in industrial 
production, separated in a continuous centrifuge. Cream from the milk of 
pastured cows eating a natural diet may be slightly yellowed, in other 
words, cream colored.

<p>Cream is graded depending on how much of the product is butterfat and 
how much is milk. Below are the US Federal guidelines, but the actual 
content may vary somewhat with region. I know that Alta Dena "Heavy 
Whipping Cream" here in Southern California is about 34% butterfat. 
Ingredients: heavy cream, skim milk - less than 1% each of mono and 
diglycerides, polysorbate 80, carrageenan (<a href="da_milk.html#01"><b>01</b></a>).

   <h3>Sour Cream</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Smetana (Slavic)]
   <br><img src="img/da_crmsr02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Sour Cream" class=mrg> 
   <p>
   This is a well soured cream, very popular especially in the cuisines 
   of Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic regions and North 
   America. In North America this product is usually between 12% to 20% 
   butterfat but may be higher in the best brands. In Europe it may be 
   from 10% to 30% butterfat depending on country and manufacturer.</p>
   <p>Sour Cream with a butterfat content lower than 30% is more likely 
   to curdle in cooking, and the lower the butterfat the more likely to 
   curdle. Ingredients for Alta Dena brand: Cultured cream, enzyme, 30% 
   butterfat. &nbsp; Beware: most brands are much lower in butterfat and 
   add various gums and stabilizers for consistency, and they may sour 
   it with acid rather than bacterial culture. Read the label. Divide 
   Total Fat by the Serving Size to get butterfat content.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Cr&egrave;me Fraiche</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     [Cr&egrave;me &eacute;paisse (France)]
   <br><img src="img/da_crmfrs02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Cr&egrave;me Fraiche" class=mrg>
   <p>
   A lightly soured cream popular in France and Northern Europe, but in 
   France, the name Cr&egrave;me Fraiche is used for regular pourable 
   cream and this product is called Cr&egrave;me &eacute;paisse. It is 
   soured with <i>L. cremoris</i>, <i>L. lactis</i>, and <i>L. 
   biovar diacetylactis</i>, though other bacteria may also be included, 
   and it behaves a bit different than regular sour cream.
   </p>   
   <p>This sour cream has a butterfat content between 30% and 45%. Due 
   to this high fat content it does not curdle in cooking and is often 
   used to finish soups and sauces. It is also used as a very rich 
   topping for fruit and the like.</p>
   <p>Ingredients (in Europe): Cream, culture. &nbsp; <b>Beware:</b> in 
   North America a "low fat Cr&egrave;me Fraiche" is made with 15% 
   butterfat and stabilized with gums. It is not so resistant to curdling 
   so cannot be used as a substitute in cooking. The photo specimen was 
   Bellwether Farms, Sonoma Country, California, as sold by Trader Joe's, 
   and is 39% butterfat. Ingred: Cultured grade A pasteurized cream.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Crema Mexicana</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_crmmex02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Creama Mexicana" class=mrg> 
   Here there is confusion. One company's "Crema Mexicana" may be a 
   sweet pourable table cream, another company's "Crema Mexicana" may 
   be a sour cream. Some companies call the soured version "Crema 
   Mexicana Agria". Butterfat content may vary as well. The photo 
   specimen is very faintly soured, and thickened sufficiently to keep 
   our toothpick from falling over, but it is very pourable.
   <p>These creams are very popular among the Mexican population here 
   in Southern California as a topping poured over robustly flavored 
   foods and used as an ingredient in soups, sauces, dressings and dips. 
   Typical Ingredients (pourable version): Pasteurized cream and milk, 
   salt, guar gum, carrageenan (<a href="da_milk.html#01"><b>01</b></a>).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Crema Salvadore&ntilde;a</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_crmsalv02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Crema Salvadore" class=mrg>
   This product is very widely available in Southern California and 
   used by the substantial Latino population. Some say it is closer 
   to Cr&egrave;me Fraiche than is regular sour cream, but at 20% 
   butterfat content it may not have as much resistance to curdling 
   as Cr&egrave;me Fraiche. 
   <p>In Central American and Mexican cuisine it is used in nachos, 
   tacos burritos, taquitos and guacamole, but in Tex Mex cuisine it 
   is often replaced by sour cream.</p>
   <p>Ingred: Cultured 
   pasteurized cream and milk, salt, modified food starch, gum acacia, 
   locust bean gum, carrageenan (<a href="da_milk.html#01"><b>01</b></a>), annatto 
   (color).

<h2 id="butter">Butter</h2>

<p><img src="img/da_butter02h.jpg" alt="dish of Curled Butter" class=mrg>
Butter is made from cream, by agitating the cream in a churn or 
mixer until the coating around the butterfat globules breaks down and 
the globules stick together as a solid mass. This mass consists of 
butterfat, milk proteins and water. The cream may be sweet or 
mildly soured by fermentation. If soured, the whey that is drained 
from the butter is called Buttermilk.</p>
<p>For economic reasons and production volume, butter is normally made 
from the cream of cow milk, but sheep, goat, buffalo and yak milk can 
also be used. Commercial butter is about 80% butterfat and 15% water, 
the rest being mostly milk solids. Home made butter is usually somewhat 
lower in butterfat.</p> 
<p>Butter is sold in two basic forms - salted and unsalted. Unsalted 
is more common in Europe and salted more common in North America. 
Salted stores longer and tastes better. Many recipes call for 
unsalted butter because the amount of salt in salted butter varies 
by manufacturer, or just because that's what fancy European chefs 
use.</p>
<p>Butter terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cultured Butter:</b> &nbsp; Butter made from cream that has been 
  allowed to become somewhat sour from fermentation. Today it is generally 
  made from pasteurized cream with culture added, or adding culture 
  directly to butter and allowing it to ferment in storage.</li>
<li><b>Sweet Cream Butter:</b> &nbsp; Butter made from pasteurized cream.
</li>
<li><b>Raw Cream Butter:</b> &nbsp; Butter made from unpasteurized cream. 
  This has a very short refrigerated shelf life of about 10 days.</li>
<li><b>European Style Butter:</b> &nbsp; This is Cultured Butter, which 
  is most popular on the continent, while the United States and United 
  Kingdom produce mainly Sweet Cream Butter.</li>
<li><b>Whey Butter:</b> &nbsp; This butter is made as a byproduct of 
  cheese making. It is lower in fat than regular butter, saltier, 
  tangy and has a little of a cheese flavor. Not common in North 
  America.</li>

   <h3>Clarified Butter</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_butclar02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Clarified Butter" class=mrg> 
   Clarified butter can be used for frying at higher temperatures because 
   it is almost pure butterfat. Unsalted butter is melted and let stand 
   until cool but still liquid. The whey proteins are skimmed off the 
   top, and the butterfat is poured off leaving water and casein proteins 
   in the bottom of the pan. This is a very common cooking ingredient, 
   particularly in Europe. The photo specimen is still in it's melted 
   state. It is easy to make at home by our recipe 
   <a href="../recipes/gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee &amp; Clarified 
   Butter</b></a>.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3><b>Ghee</b></h3>
   <br><img src="img/oi_ghee09h.jpg" alt="Dish of Ghee" class=mrg> 
   Ghee can be used at quite high temperatures, up to 480&deg;F/250&deg;C. 
   During clarification the butter is not just melted, it is taken up to 
   250&deg;F/120&deg;C. This causes the water to evaporate and the milk 
   solids to brown lightly. This flavors the butter and creates 
   antioxidants which protect the ghee from rancidity. It is shelf stable 
   at room temperature for up to 8 months.
   <p>While Ghee is most associated with India, it is also much used 
   through Anatolia and Caucasus, the Middle East and the Arabic 
   countries, including the Levant and North Africa. It is easy to make 
   at home by our recipe

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Nutrition <small>&amp;</small> Health</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="02">Milk</h2>

<p>How much milk should people drink? Is it really safe? These questions 
are hard to answer, especially since most scientific research is bought 
and paid for by the powerful dairy industry. The current official 
recommendation is three glasses a day. "Anything less than three glasses 
a day, and you won't get all of the nutrients that you need" - Connie 
Weaver, head of food and nutrition at Purdue University. Her funding 
comes mostly from the National Institutes of Health, but also from the 
National Dairy Council.</p>

<p>"This is one of the most complicated and interesting areas of 
nutrition and we simply don't have all of the answers" - Dr. Walter 
Willett, chairman of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
Dr. Willet recommends one or two cups of milk a day and considers 
anything beyond that a possible risk.</p>

<p>Of course, people like myself, who do not drink milk at all (I am 
not lactose intolerant), don't seem to have any deficiency problems 
whatever from our lack of consumption. Again, milk is not a natural 
food for adult humans. It has been adapted to, imperfectly, by some 
cultures.</p>

<p>Vegans, including PETA members, spread alarmist propaganda against 
milk, much of it exaggerated or simply not true. They are idealists, 
and idealists always feel their ends justify <u>any</u> means, and 
ethics simply don't apply. The Physicians Committee for Responsible 
Medicine is another anti-milk propaganda operation, actually a stealth 
front for PETA - again with the ethics thing.</p>
 
<p>These groups claim milk increases the risk of heart disease, cancers 
of the breast, prostate and ovaries, doesn't help prevent osteoporosis, 
and is linked to allergies, obesity, constipation and other diseases. 
and is in general "Gross", often contaminated with cow blood and pus.</p>

<p>None of these allegations has been confirmed by legitimate scientific 
research, including large demographic studies. In fact, just about nothing 
has been unequivocably confirmed scientifically, the evidence simply isn't 
strong enough in one direction or the other.</p>

<p>The most substantial evidence so far is that milk does produce some 
improvement in bone density and may reduce heart attack rates in both men 
and women, and possibly reduce colo-rectal cancer. On the other hand some 
studies, but not others, have indicated a small increase in prostate 
cancer among men who drank a lot of milk. None of this evidence is strong 
enough to be conclusive.</p>

<p>Of course milk matters only for persons descended from the herding 
tribes of Europe, Western and Central Asia, Mongolia and a few parts of 
Africa. The rest of the world, well over half its population, is largely 
lactose intolerant and won't be drinking any milk at all once they are 
beyond infancy.</p>

<p>Strangely, not drinking three glasses of milk a day has not 
devastated these populations. The industry has been feeding you a lot 
of bull (bulls, by the way, don't produce milk).</p>

<h3>Raw Milk:</h3> &nbsp; There are quite a few nutritionists 
who recommend drinking only raw milk, because the nutritional content of 
pasteurized milk is significantly lower than that of raw milk. Also, 
some people who cannot tolerate pasteurized milk can drink raw milk 
without problems. 

<p>While the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) admits the lower 
nutritional value of pasteurized milk, and that the actual risk is 
very low in properly operated dairies, and the public demand for raw 
milk is high, the FDA will make every effort to prosecute and put out 
of business any dairy that provides raw milk. FDA Raids from California 
to Pennsylvania have been similar to raids on dangerous drug 
traffickers.</p>

<p>A large dairy operation here in Southern California, Alta Dena, 
which was fully certified to produce and sell raw milk, was simply 
hounded out of that business by continuous FDA harassment. 
Alta Dena's other milk products still have a major presence here, 
and I very much recommend their Sour Cream.</p>

<p>Incidentally, a number of cheeses cannot be properly made with 
pasteurized milk. The FDA will not allow the import or making of such 
cheeses if they are not a very long aged variety.</p>

<h2 id="01">Carrageenan</h2>

<p>This substance is very 
widely used in dairy and beverage products as a gelling agent and 
stabilizer. It is derived from seaweed, Irish moss and others. It  
is allowed in standard and organic foods in the United States, 
including baby formula, but is banned from baby formula in Europe as a 
precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Carrageenan is currently under fairly intensive investigation for 
possibly causing gastro-intestinal inflammation, tumors and other GI tract  
problems. So far the evidence is inconclusive and somewhat contradictory. 
Part of this uncertainty may result from method - carrageenan may be 
more dangerous when fed in water than when bound to proteins as it is in 
dairy product usage. More investigation is warranted.</p>
<p>On the plus side, carrageenan is an active antiviral agent for 
topical applications. It is the first to be found effective against 
the common cold (applied proactively as a nasal spray) and is also 
effective against Herpes Simplex (HSV) and Human papillomavirus (HPV) 
applied as a "personal lubricant", but has not proved at all effective 
against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>
