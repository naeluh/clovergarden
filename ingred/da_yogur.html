<h1>Yogurt <small>&amp;</small> Fermented Milk Products</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Fermented milk products probably came into use as soon 
as milking domesticated animals began, because milk is very perishable 
and starts to ferment immediately.</span> 

<p>Controlling milk ferments was probably a high priority for development, 
because it resulted in milk products that could be kept on hand for more 
than just a few hours. Once milk was stabilized by fermentation, it could 
even be dried or otherwise processed for even longer keeping. The 
fermenting process also proved to have health advantages beyond just 
preservation.</p>

<h2 id="yogu" class=lrg>Yogurt</h2>

<br><img src="img/da_yogurt02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Yogurt" class=mrg>
  [Yogurt (Turkish), Yoghurt (UK, Australia, English Canada), Yogourt 
  (France, French Canada), Madzoon (Armenia), Da-hi (India)]
<p>
Without qualifiers, the name "Yogurt" implies "plain yogurt", just as 
the bacteria have fermented and coagulated it. It has a light, delicate 
texture but is solid enough to be picked up with a fork. It is made in 
both "natural" and "industrial" versions - read the ingredients list on 
the label. In commercial production, plain yogurt is often flavored with 
fruit, honey or other flavoring substances.</p>

<p>The origin of yogurt, both time and place, is uncertain, but the 
earliest written mention is from ancient Greek sources that attribute 
it to barbarians to the north (Bulgaria, etc.). Since antiquity there 
have been many claims of health benefits from eating yogurt, and many 
of them may be true.</p>

<p>Yogurt is a bacterial fermentation product of regular milk. In this 
fermentation lactose is converted to lactic acid, which acts on the 
milk proteins to form a gel. <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</i> subsp. 
<i>bulgaricus</i> and <i>Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria</i> are 
the major bacteria, but others may be added.</p>

<p>Yogurt is made predominantly from the milk of cows, but also 
from water buffalo, goats, sheep, horses, camels, and yaks, depending 
on region.</p> 

<p>Industrial production was started in 1919 in Spain by Isaac Carasso, 
a Sephardic Jew from Ottoman Salonica, with his Danone company, later 
called Dannon in North America.</p>

   <h3>Labne</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Labneh,Labni; Suzma, S&uuml;me 
     (Turkic); Strained yogurt, Yogurt Cheese, Kefir cheese (not exact)]
   <br><img src="img/da_lebne01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Labne" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is plain yogurt with the whey squeezed out. In homes, this is 
   done by putting it in a cloth bag and suspending over a bowl. In 
   production, the whey is removed in centrifuges. This produces a 
   product that is similar to a very soft white cheese.</p>
   <p>This product is often used in cooking in the Eastern Mediterranean 
   region and parts of India because the fat content is high enough to 
   prevent it from curdling.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Greek Yogurt</h3>
   <br><img src="img/da_yoggr02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Greek Yogurt" class=mrg>
   This is strained Yogurt similar to Labne but with more whey remaining 
   - or it can be plain Yogurt with thickeners to make it seem strained. 
   This is all coupled with fancy advertising programs aimed at 
   separating yuppies from their money by making them feel special. 
   The name comes from the first successful North American strained 
   yogurt promotion by Fage, an Athens based company. Greeks actually 
   use mostly plain, unstrained yogurt. This product varies a lot in 
   firmness, depending on manufacturer its healthiness is often seriously 
   compromised by addition of sweet fruit concentrates, honey, and 
   other adulterants.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Aryan</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/da_yaryan03h.jpg" alt="Dish of Aryan" class=mrg>
   This is a lightly sour drink simply made from yogurt thinned with 
   water. My favorite brand is Abali, who also make a mint flavored 
   version. Ingred: Low fat milk, water, salt, active yogurt cultures. 
   Of course, many of our industrialists just don't do things that simply 
   - read the label. I have encountered another brand with these 
   ingredients: Cultured pasteurized skim milk, water, cream, whey 
   protein concentrate, tapioca &amp; corn starch, salt, carrageenan, 
   Contains live active yogurt cultures probiotic bacteria (S. 
   thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium ssp).

<h3>Kefir</h3> 
<br><img src="img/da_kefir02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Kefir" class=mrg>
This is a lightly soured and lightly thickened drink made from 
cultured whole milk. It is also used as an ingredient, in liquid or 
dried form. It has more fats, more protein, more probiotic bacteria, 
and more yeast than yogurt. Kefir originated from the North Caucasus, 
Eastern Europe, and Russia. My favorite brand is Karoun. Ingred: 
Cultured pasteurized Grade A milk and skim milk. Live active Kefir 
cultures: L. Bulgaricus (delbrueckii), S. Thermophilus, L. Rhamnosus, 
L. Lactis, L. Diacetylactis, L Cremoris, L. Mesenteroides, 
L. Acidophilus, L. Paracasei, Bifidobacterium.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Kefir Grains</h3> 
<br><img src="img/da_kefirpilze01e.jpg" alt="Pile of Kefir Grains" class=mrg>
This is the culture used to ferment whole milk into Kefir. The culture, 
of bacteria and yeasts is held together by milk proteins, lipids, and 
polysaccharides.  The culture may include L. Bulgaricus (delbrueckii), 
S. Thermophilus, L. Rhamnosus, L. Lactis, L. Diacetylactis, L Cremoris, 
L. Mesenteroides, L. Acidophilus, L. Paracasei, and Bifidobacterium.
The exact balance of bacteria and yeasts varies from batch to batch 
due to exact fermenting conditions. The grains are strained out of the 
product and used for the next batch.

<h3>Kashk</h3> 
<br><img src="img/in_kashk02h.jpg" alt="Pile of Kashk Granules" class=mrg>
This product is made from yogurt and other fermented milk products, often 
combined with grains, dried and formed into balls or powder. It is easily 
transported and used as the basis of slightly sour soups, just add 
water, broth or milk. It is popular in Iran, Kurdish regions, Turkey, 
Mongolia, Central Asia, Transcaucasis, and the Levant The photo specimen 
was made in Lebanon from Bulgur wheat and dried Kefir from sheep milk. 
It is Tazah brand, so easily found in Southern California.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="tarha">Tarhana</h3>
<br><img src="img/in_trahan01h.jpg" alt="Pile of Trahana Crumbs" class=mrg>
[Tarhana (Turk); Trahan&aacute; (Greek); Tarkhana (Armenia); 
Tarxana (Kurd); Tarkhineh, Tarkhaneh, Tarkhwaneh (Persian)]
<p>
This product is made from grain flour and yogurt and other fermented 
milk products, dried and formed into crumbs. Other ingredients, including 
vegetables, may be added. It is easily transported and used as the basis 
of slightly sour soups, just add water, broth, or milk. It is popular in 
the Balkans, including Greece, the Caucasus and Persia. The photo specimen 
of Sour Trahan&aacute; was made in Greece from Soft Wheat Flour and 
Yogurt, purchased on-line. The crumbs were about 0.05 inch randoms.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Nutrition <small>&amp;</small> Health</h2>

<p>These fermented milk products are considered very healthful, 
especially with the current emphasis on probiotic bacterial cultures, 
which these products are packed with. Because their fermentation 
turns lactose into lactic acid, many people who are lactose intolerant 
can consume them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, manufacturers of these products, especially those 
that advertise heavily, not only use unnatural processes to make them, 
sacrificing health benefits, or, in a play for shelf space and the 
yuppie market, adulterate them with sugar and sugar laden fruit 
concentrates. These products are of little, or even negative, health 
benefit, yet are sold with the implication they are "health foods".</p>
