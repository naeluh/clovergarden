<h1>Dipsacales - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<i>Dipsacales</i>, or Honeysuckles is a small order of seven to ten 
families (depending on how you want to look at it), only three of which 
contain plants of culinary interest, but one of them, Elderberries, is 
quite important worldwide. The photo is of Honeysuckle <i>Lonicera 
japonica</i> which blooms white, then darkens to yellow.

<h2 id="elder">Elderberry Family</h2>

<p>These plants were formerly part of the Honeysuckle family, but the 
Angiosperm Phylogeny Group found them different enough to separate out 
into a separate family.</p>

   [<i>Sambucus nigra</i> and many similar species]
   <p>
   Elderberries range from low shrubs to medium size trees, and are found 
   on all continents except Antarctica. Those known in Europe, Asia and 
   North America produce blue-black berries or bright red berries, but 
   Australian species produce white or yellow berries. For a detail 
   list of species see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus">
   Sambucus</a> at Wikipedia.</p>
   <p>Elderberries, both flowers and fruit, are much used throughout 
   their regions to produce flavoring syrups and beverages, both 
   non-alcoholic and alcoholic, including wines. The berries and flowers 
   are also used to produce jams and pie fillings. In Germany, umbels 
   (clusters) of berries are battered and deep fried as a sweet desert, 
   topped with sugar and cinnamon. Elderberries have traditionally been 
   used as a mild medicinal in Europe, and the tree figures in 
   Traditional Chinese medicine as well.

   Moosomin (Cree); <i>Viburnum edule</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Nannyberry, 
   Sheepberry, Sweet Viburnum: <i>Viburnum lentago</i>]
   <p>
   Most viburnums are somewhat toxic or cause digestive problems, but 
   no problems have been reported for this fruit, either raw or cooked. 
   It is highly regarded for jam, and can also be dried for winter use. 
   The berries are about 0.35 inch diameter, bright red with a single 
   large seed. They are somewhat tart but with a pleasant taste. The 
   American Indians may have waited until after the first frost to 
   harvest them, at which time they would probably be less tart. This 
   plant is native to the far northern states of the United States, all 
   of Canada and Alaska, and in spots extends as far south as Colorado 
   and Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p><i>V. lentago</i> is also edible, but less well known. It has 
   blue-black fruits around 1/2 inch long. This plant is native to the 
   Great Lakes region of the United States, and spills over into Canada 
   in a couple of places. I suspect there are other viburnus with 
   culinary uses, but I have insufficient information on any others.

<h2 id="honey">Honeysuckle Family</h2> 
<br>[<i>Caprifoliaceae</i>]

<p>While long used by children, who pull the narrow funnel shaped 
flowers off and suck the sweet nectar from the stem end, honeysuckles 
have not been noted for food. Some species produce berries that are 
mildly toxic, some are edible but rather bitter - but one species 
seems to be a major exception.</p>

   [Honeyberry, Sweetberry Honeysuckle; Hascap (Japan); <i>Lonicera 
   caerulea</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub, growing to about 6 feet tall, is native to the colder 
   latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It has avoided west coasts of 
   North America and Eurasia but is now being planted in Oregon state. 
   The berries are up to 0.4 inch diameter and are reported to taste 
   like raspberries, blueberries and/or black currants.</p>
   <p>These berries are expected to have a bright future flavoring ice 
   cream, smoothies, yogurt, etc. particularly because the seeds are 
   almost unnoticeable and the skin disintegrates easily and completely 
   when processed. They can also be made into a deep red wine which is 
   considered comparable to grape wine. Care must be taken with ripeness, 
   as unripe berries can be completely blue but have greenish flesh that 
   tastes grassy and bitter. The flesh is deep red-purple when ripe.

   [Western Trumpet Honeysuckle; <i>Lonicera ciliosa</i>]
   <p>
   Native to forests of western North America, this shrub can grow to 
   20 feet. The orange flowers and fruit form over a disk leaf (two 
   leaves fused at the base) at the end of twig shoots. The berries are 
   translucent orange or pink, less than 0.4 inch diameter. They are 
   considered edible, raw or cooked, but are little used.

   [Corn Salad, Lamb's Lettuce, Fetticus, Field Salad, Feldsalat, Nut Lettuce, 
   Rapunzel; <i>Valerianella locusta</i>]
   <p>
   This small plant is the only commonly eaten species in the entire 
   Valerian family (Red Valerian is edible, but not considered worth the 
   bother). This slow growing herb is gathered wild and planted in 
   gardens in the cooler latitudes of the temperate region. In warmer 
   areas it bolts too quickly. Because it is usually quite small, with 
   closely spaced leaves, it is often used as a garnish in fancy 
   restaurants.</p>
   <p>Where easily available, it is a common salad green. 
   The flavor is unique and slightly nutty (emphasis on "slightly"). The 
   common name "Corn Salad" comes from it being a common weed in wheat 
   fields (called "corn fields" in England). The photo specimens, about 
   2-3/4 inches across, were obtained from a specialty grower in a 
   Los Angeles farmer's market.

   [Jupiter's Beard, Spur Valerian; <i>Centranthus ruber</i>]
   <p>
   This common garden plant is native to the Mediterranean region has 
   been naturalized in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, 
   as well as the British Isles and Australia. It comes in both red 
   and white flowering varieties. Leaves are edible raw in salads or 
   cooked as greens, and roots can be boiled in soups. There is 
   controversy as to whether you'd really want to eat it either way, 
   as some don't like the taste.

   [Edible Valerian; Kooya <i>Valeriana edulis</i>]
   <p>
   This plant, native to western North America is probably no longer 
   eaten, but was of great importance to American Indians on the 
   western side of the Rocky Mountains, particularly in and near 
   Colorado. The Indians considered the roots toxic, so they were pit 
   baked for 2 days before serving. The flavor and aroma are said to be 
   very unique, found intriguing by some, and found totally offensive 
   by others.
