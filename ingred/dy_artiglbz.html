[<i>Cynara scolymus</i>]
<p>
   The dominant artichoke in North America, the Green Globe is grown in 
   Monterey County on the central coast of California. The harvest begins 
   in March and continues well into May with a smaller harvest in 
   September and October. Sizes range from 18 count (jumbo) through 60 
   count, plus "large loose" (cocktail) and "small loose" (baby) sizes. 
   The "count" is for a 22 to 24 pound case.
   <p>The Green Globe is a perennial crop and fairly expensive to produce 
   so attempts to replace it with lower cost annual varieties growable in 
   other parts of California are being made - so far with less than fully 
   satisfactory results.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Simple is best, but fancy chefs have come up 
with hundreds of recipes for stuffing them, and sauces that mask their 
flavor. A waste of time in my opinion - but that's what fancy chefs get 
paid for. For a nice simple approach, see our recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/8av_artisteam1.html"><b>Steamed Artichokes</b></a>
<p></p> 


<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Select artichokes that are heavy for their size 
and have firm green leaves. Reject any that have splayed, dry, split, 
pitted or brown tipped leaves. Artichokes with frost or wind burn may 
not look as good but be otherwise fine. For a photo of one in this 
condition, see our <a href="dy_thistle.html#burn"><b>Thistles</b></a> 
page.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh artichokes will keep in a cool place 
for a day or two, and up to a week loosely bagged in the fridge. Wet 
the stem for storage, but not the rest of the artichoke.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If your artichoke has sharp thorns, cut off the 
top 1 inch with a very sharp knife. Then cut off just the tips of the 
large exposed leaves with thorns with kitchen shears. Don't forget 
to apply lemon juice to cuts to prevent browning.<p></p>
