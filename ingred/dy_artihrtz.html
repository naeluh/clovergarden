[<i>Cynara scolymus</i>]
<p>
These are from the same plants  that produce the big Green Globe type 
artichokes. Some time after the big flower at the top has been cut, 
a number of much smaller flowers sprout along the stem. These are the 
"Baby Artichokes" sometimes seen in our produce stores here in 
California. They are also trimmed and made into "Artichoke Hearts", 
usually canned, but sometimes available frozen.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were Reese brand from Peru. The two "Hearty" size 
specimens, left in the photo, were typically 2-1/4 inches long and 1-1/4 
inches diameter, 5 to 7 per can. The other 4 were "Baby" size, typically 
2-1/8 inches long and 1-1/8 inches diamter, 10 to 12 per can. Both sizes 
were packed in 14 ounce cans, both with a drained weight of 8.5 ouncess.

<p>Artichoke Hearts are used as apptizers, and to dress up salads, pasta 
dishes, pizzas and the like. They are also used as an ingredient in 
vegetable, chicken, and fish stews.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; No cooking is required for the canned Artichoke 
Hearts, and they are entirely edible. Frozen will probably need some 
cooking, but since I haven't found any of those I can't tell you how 
long. Some report that the canned are better than the frozen.
<p></p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Look for canned Artichoke Hearts in the same 
section of you market as for Palm Hearts. They will probably also have 
Artichoke Bottoms, which are much larger and without leaves. The 
photo specimens were all Reese brand, grown and packed in Peru, but 
Artichoke Hearts are also canned in Spain.<p></p>
