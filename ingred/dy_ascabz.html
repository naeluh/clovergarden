<p>
This perennial herb is common in mountain regions of China, Japan. the 
Russian east, and particularly Korea. It is in cultivation in Korea, 
where the young, tender stems are considered a welcome harbinger of 
Spring. The rest of the year, dried shoots are used. It has a unique 
herbal aroma and a pleasant bitterness.</p>

<p>As the plant gets older, it sends up a hard stalk about 4 feet high, 
with widely spaced leaves, and a profusion of thin branches at the top 
with small white aster-like flowers on the tips.

<p>In Korea this herb is very commonly used in banchan (small side 
dishes), but also in soups and stews, particularly Bibimbap, one 
of Korea's signature dishes.</p>

This is one of the few kinds of Korean dried stems where leaves are 
also included. It has a very nice herbal aroma.</p>


<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In North America, this plant 
is not much available except dried. Find it in Korean markets. Packages 
of Korean origin are considered superior. Sealed packages, kept 
away from heat and sunlight, should last over a year.<p></p>

<h3>Yield</h3>: &nbsp; After the boil and cool cycle, and wringing out 
excess water, 1 ounce makes 3-1/2 ounces. After an overnight soak and 
wringing out excess water, 1 ounce makes 3-3/4 ounces. That may not 
seem like much improvement, but texture and color are noticeably 
improved.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The dried shoots must be rehydrated, and that 
doesn't happen real fast. Korean cooking maven Maangchi recommends this 
procedure: 
<br class=cll>
<ol>
<li>Take dried <b>Aster Scaber</b> out of the package and rinse it.</li>
<li>Put the <b>Dried Shoots</b> in a pot with cold water to cover it 
  by 4 inches. Cover the pot and bring to a boil for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Set the pot aside, covered, and let cool for 2 or 3 hours.
  </li>
<li>Drain <b>Shoots</b> and rinse several times to remove dirt and grit.
  </li>
<li>Return to the pot. Cover with cold water by 4 or 5 inches. Let soak 
  overnight or at least 10 hours.</li>
<li>Rinse and drain. It is now ready for use in recipes.</li>
</ol>
