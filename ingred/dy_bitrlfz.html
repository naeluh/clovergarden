  <i>Vernonia amygdalina</i> syn. <i>Gymnanthemum amygdalinum</i> also  
  V. colorata, V. calvoana, probably others]
<p>
These large shrubs or small trees are native to Tropical Africa but are
also widespread in West Africa and as far south as Angola and Mozambique.
There are about 1000 species of <i>Veronia</i> native to Africa, North 
and South America and Asia but only in Sub-Saharan Africa are they used 
as a green leafy vegetable. The species listed above are the main ones, 
with <i>V. amygdalina</i> dominating, and the nearly identical 
<i>V. colorata</i> in higher, drier environments. The leaves are 
particularly used in Nigeria and Zimbabwe in soups, including Bitter 
Leaf Soup, and stews. They are best used fresh, but dried are also used. 
The photo is of my own plant, two months from when it was about 10 inches 
high. This is a fast growing plant. This one consists of two shoots from 
a rooted cutting.</p>

<p>Bitter Leaf, and other species in the Veronia genus are highly 
medicinal, particularly against parasites, and are used throughout 
their range. They are currently under intensive research to 
scientifically verify their medicinal uses.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; In North America Bitter Leaf is available 
dried, mainly on-line from African specialty sources, but is costly. 
Fresh leaves are becoming available in California and Florida, but 
still at very high prices.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; Plants are easily available on the Internet 
to grow your own fresh leaves. This is a very fast growing plant, and 
will tolerate growing an a container, if it is large enough. The photo 
specimen, from a cutting, grew very fast, straight and high. It was 
knocked over by high winds to about 45 degrees. This is fine - in Africa 
they often plant them at an angle to encourage side branches. in the 
photo you see side branches with the two main stems in the background.
<p></p> 

<h3>Harvesting:</h3> &nbsp; Once your plant has branched out, it is 
best to cut the ends of shoots rather than picking individual leaves. 
This causes the plant to produce more branches with lots of leaves. 
In East Africa shoots are cut during the wet season when they can 
regenerate, and leaves are picked during the dry season.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Their Bitterness is caused by anti-nutrient 
phytochemicals, which is the reason for extensive preparation before 
using in recipes. Leaves are always washed and wrung out in several 
changes of water to reduce this bitterness to the extent desired.<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bitterleaf Soup:</b> &nbsp; Freshly picked leaves are laid out in 
  the sun until well wilted to toughen them. The leaves are then washed 
  by massaging in changes of water to remove bitterness. They need 
  to be added early in the cooking.</li>
<li><b>Egusi Soup:</b> &nbsp; (and others) &nbsp; Freshly picked leaves 
  are washed immediately by massaging in changes of water to remove 
  bitterness. They remain tender, so are added towards the end of 
  cooking.</li>
<li><b>Dried Bitterleaf:</b> &nbsp; These will have been washed before 
  drying. This rehydration procedure is based on that of Nigerian 
  Flo Madubike, but substitutes Baking Soda (a proven substitute) for 
  Edible Potash, which is not commonly available in American kitchens.
  <ol>
  <li>Wet the dry Bitter Leaves.</li>
  <li>Drain the Leaves and sprinkle lightly with Baking Soda, tossing 
    to get even distribution.</li>
  <li>Pack the Leaves medium tight in a very strong plastic bag and tie 
    it firmly so it is air tight.</li>
  <li>Place the bag in a deep pot and fill the pot half way with water.
    </li>
  <li>Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Hold at a low boil 
    for 30 minutes, adding more water if needed.</li>
  <li>Wash and massage the leaves in changes of cold water until the 
    water runs clear and the Baking Soda is completely washed away.</li>
  <li>The leaves are now recipe ready.</li>
  </ol></li>
