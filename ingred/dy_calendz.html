<p>
There are two genera of subfamily <i>Astroideae</i> that are commonly 
called "Marigold", one from the Old World, one from the New World. 
Ironically, the New World genus now has greater culinary importance 
then the Old World genus. There are others, including Huacatay, which 
has greater culinary importance than either of the well known ones.

[<i>Calendula officinalis</i> of subfamily <i>Asteroideae</i>]
</p><p>
   This plant, probably from southern Europe, is well known in North 
   America as a medicinal tea ingredient and for fresh petals scattered 
   on salads to add color interest. Fresh leaves have been used in salads 
   and as a pot herb, but palatability varies with variety. Flowers and 
   sometimes leaves were once commonly used in soups in Germany, thus 
   the name "Pot Marigold".

<h2>Calendula Petals</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_calendp02e.jpg" alt="Dried Calendula Petals" class=mrg>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have not seen these in markets here in Southern 
California, even those with the most complete herb sections. They are, 
however, easily available on the Internet because of their use in 
medicinal teas. They are sold in two forms, dried petals and dried 
flowers. For tea, whole flowers are fine, but to use as an herb dried 
petals, as shown in the photo, are much more usable. The high quality 
petals in the photo were purchased on-line for US 2013 $2.99 / ounce, 
plus shipping, which brought them to $4.41 / ounce (3 ounces purchased).
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Do not grind until ready to use. In a tightly 
sealed container stored in a cool place out of direct sunlight, dried 
petals should last at least 6 months.<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; While this is a 
medicinal plant, the amounts used in cooking should be entirely harmless. 
Medicinally, calendula has been found to be antibacterial and antifungal. 
Apparently, there are other non-medicinal applications - the package the 
photo specimens came in suggested, "protection, prophetic dreams, legal 
matters, psychic powers, aids visionary sight", presumably as tea.<p></p>

[Imeruli Shaphrani (Georgia); <i>Tagetes patula</i> alt <i>Tagates 
remotiflora</i>]
<p>
   This plant is native to the highlands of southern Mexico and Guatemala, 
   but has become widespread for decorative, aromatic and culinary uses. 
   In the cuisine of Georgia (former Soviet Republic of), marigold 
   petals (<i>Tagetes patula</i>) are a very important herbal flavoring.  
   The dried petals are very aromatic. Powdered, they add both color and 
   an earthy aroma to many recipes. Marigolds are also fed to chickens 
   to get a nice rich color in the yolks of their eggs. Unfortunately 
   dried petals are very difficult to find in North America. About the 
   only way to get them is to grow your own marigolds. Calendula petals 
   are as close as we can buy. They are aromatic but are not the same.
   </p>
   <p>This plant is often used in gardening as a companion plant, 
   providing some protection against bacteria and insects both above 
   and below ground. It should not be planted near legumes or other 
   nitrogen fixing plants. The essential oil has a number of medicinal 
   uses. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Dori distributed under license Creative Commons

  Wild marigold; Anisillo (Spanish); Chinchilla, Chiquilla, Chilca, 
  Zuico, Suico (South America); Huacatay (Peru); Huacataya (Bolivia); 
  <i>Tagetes minuta</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to western South America, but has been 
naturalized in numerous areas in Australasia, Asia, North America, 
Europe and Africa. It has a weedy, vertical growth habit up to 6 feet 
tall. It has long been used as a culinary flavoring and tea in 
Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. There are also products made 
from Huacatay that are more available in North America than the 
fresh plant.
