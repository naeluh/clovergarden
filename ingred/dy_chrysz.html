Native to the Mediterranean region, these slightly bitter greens are now 
popular in most Asian cuisines, particularly for soups and stews, but also 
for stir fries. In Taiwan they are used in oyster omelets, a popular night 
market food, and in Korea as one of the many Banchan (small side dishes) 
served with a Korean meal. Young shoots are eaten in Crete, and flowers, 
fresh or dried, are used in herbal teas. Most common here in Southern 
California is the Small Leaf Tong Ho, as in the photo, but a Broad Leaf 
Tong Ho is occasionally seen. The greens are high in potassium, other 
minerals, carotene and antioxidants.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found fresh, year round, in Korean 
and other Asian markets, at least here in Southern Califonria.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These greens can be eaten raw in salads, but 
are more usually cooked. For any method, cooking time should be very 
short, and for soups and stews, add for just the last few minutes.
