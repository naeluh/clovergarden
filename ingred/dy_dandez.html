<h1>Dandelion</h1>

[Dent-de-lion (Old French), Pissenlit (French), <i>Taraxacum officinale</i>]
<p>
Originating in Eurasia and now infesting lawns worldwide, this common 
weed is a highly successful member of the vast daisy family 
(<i>Asteraceae</i>). Its long taproot makes it very difficult to eradicate 
and its efficient windblown seed dispersal system assures reinfection. It 
prefers temperate climate and moist soil, which is why it has such an 
affinity for lawns. The photo specimen leaves were up to 14 inches long. but 
they are sold up to around 16 inches.</p>
<p>The plant has both medicinal and culinary value. Young leaves are used 
raw in salads while older ones are more often cooked or added to soups. . 
Under their bitterness the leaves have considerable sweetness and have a 
particular affinity for eggs. Roots are used, as are chicory roots, to make 
a coffee substitute, and flower heads are used to make dandelion wine. The 
leaves are a strong diuretic, thus the French name Pissenlit (wet the bed).
Herbalists consider dandelion a general tonic and "blood cleanser".</p>

<h3>Buying and Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Commercial cultivars are likely to 
be larger and less bitter than those growing in your lawn, but lawn 
dandelions can be used if picked well before flowering (and if not 
contaminated with dangerous "lawn care" products). Commercial dandelion 
can be found in most produce markets. Look for crisp unwilted bright 
green leaves. Ideally, especially for salads and delicate recipes, they 
should be about 9 inches long. Loosely bagged and not too wet they will 
keep in the refrigerator for about 5 days.<p></p>

<p>Sometimes a variety of chicory, heads of large dandelion-like leaves 
with thick white stems, is sold as dandelion or "Italian dandelion". Real 
dandelion leaves are always separate (unless sold attached to the root) 
and smaller with thin stems. The chicory is, however, quite similar 
(and closely related)
