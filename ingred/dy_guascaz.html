<p>
Native to South America, this multi-branched annual herb grows to about 30 
inches tall. It first escaped from Kew Gardens in England, infesting the 
British Isles, and has since spread to North America, Australasia, Africa, 
and other regions, but Antarctica is still Guasca free.</p>

<p>This plant is best known for being a flavoring in the Aji&aacute;co 
Soup of Colombia. It can be used in fresh salads, but it's flavor is 
more pronounced after cooking. In East Africa, where leaves, stems, 
and flowers are eaten, it is gathered in the wild. It is also used dried 
and ground in soups.</p>

<h3>Buying and Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In North America, this herb is available 
on-line in dried form. I purchased a 3 pack of 10 gram poly bags for 2022 
US $12.89, or $12.28 / ounce. In a sealed package, it should be good for at 
least 6 months. Shown to the left is 1/2 Tablespoon of Kiska brand 
Guascas. 10 grams is about 6 Tablespoons.<p></p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3> &nbsp; No exact, but a combination of 1/4 dried mint and 
3/4 dried Marjoram or dried Oregano will get you fairly close.<p></p>
