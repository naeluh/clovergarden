[Many, many names - see their <a href="dy_bitrlfz.html">Bitter 
Leaf</a> page; <i>Veronia amygdalina</i>, <i>V. colorata</i>, 
<i>V. calvoana</i>, probably others]
<p>
This plant is actually not yet well known in North America, but as 
African cuisines become more popular, Bitter Leaf is becoming better 
known, Also, it's many very strong medicinal attributes are causing it 
to become more prominent. It is still in short supply here, so still 
quite expensive, but easy to grow. About 1000 species of <i>Veronia</i> 
are native to Africa, North and South America and Asia, and are used 
medicinally throughout its range, but only in Sub-Saharan Africa are 
these shrubs or small trees used to provide nutritious leafy greens. The 
leaves are particularly used in Nigeria and Zimbabwe in soups, including 
Bitter Leaf Soup, and in stews  The photo is of 
<i>Vernonia amygdalina</i>, recently sprouted from a cutting.

[Pot Marigold;  <i>Calendula officinalis</i>]
<p>
This plant, probably from southern Europe, is well known in North 
America as a medicinal tea ingredient and for fresh petals scattered 
on salads to add color interest. Fresh leaves have been used in salads 
and as a pot herb, but palatability varies with variety. Flowers and 
sometimes leaves were once commonly used in soups in Germany, thus 
the name "Pot Marigold".

   <p>
   This plant is native to the highlands of southern Mexico and Guatemala, 
   but has become widespread for decorative, aromatic and culinary uses. 
   In the cuisine of Georgia (former Soviet Republic of), marigold 
   petals (<i>Tagetes patula</i>) are a very important herbal flavoring.  
   The dried petals are very aromatic. Powdered, they add both color and 
   an earthy aroma to many recipes. Marigolds are also fed to chickens 
   to get a nice rich color in the yolks of their eggs. Unfortunately 
   dried petals are very difficult to find in North America. About the 
   only way to get them is to grow your own marigolds. Calendula petals 
   are as close as we can buy. They are aromatic but are not the same.

<i>Matricaria chamomilla</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; English Chamomile, 
Roman Chamomile, Low Chamomile; Manzanilla (Spanish); 
<i>Chamaemelum nobile</i> alt <i>Anthemis nobilis</i>]
<p>
Chamomile has a long history (since ancient Egypt) as a medicinal. 
Chamomile tea is often used for a calming effect encouraging sleep, as 
an anti-inflammatory, and for stomach problems. It is the flowers 
(usually dried) that are used. They should be steeped at very close to 
boiling, covered to prevent escape of volatile oils, and then crushed 
before straining.</p>
<p><b>German Chamomile</b>, native to Europe and Asia and introduced to 
North America and Australia, is the species most used for tea. It has an 
upright branching growth pattern with long flower stems. The photo 
specimens were purchased from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles.
<b>English Chamomile</b>, found in Europe, North America and Argentina, is 
used medicinally, in aromatherapy, and as ground cover (the lawn of 
Buckingham Palace is chamomile, not grass). It has a low, semi-recumbent 
growth profile and feathery leaves.

<p>
This low growing plant is native to the United States Southwest as far 
east as Texas and into northern Mexico. In Mexico the herb is sold as 
<i>Limoncillo</i> and used as a flavoring for meat dishes. 	The 
Havasupai, of the Grand Canyon region, parch and grind the seeds for use 
in mush and soup, and dip the greens in salt water for use as a 
condiment. The Pueblo people use it as an herbal flavoring.

<i>Chrysanthemum coronarium</i>]
<p>
Native to the Mediterranean region, these slightly bitter greens are now 
popular in most Asian cuisines, particularly for soups and stews, but also 
for stir fries. In Taiwan they are used in oyster omelets, a popular night 
market food, and in Korea as one of the many Banchan (small side dishes) 
served with a Korean meal. Young shoots are eaten in Crete, and flowers, 
fresh or dried, are used in herbal teas. Most common here in Southern 
California is the Small Leaf Tong Ho, as in the photo, but a Broad Leaf 
Tong Ho is occasionally seen.The greens are high in potassium, other 
minerals, carotene and antioxidants.

[Tashplant, Horsefoot, Farfara; Coughwort (Old English); 
<i>Tussilago farfara</i>]
<p>
Native to Europe through Central Asia, and introduced to East Asia and 
North and South America, this plant puts up dandalion like flowers before 
it leafs out. Once leafed it no longer puts up flower. It has 
traditionally been used as a medicinal tea. In Japan and some other 
regions it is used as a minor vegetable. <u>Caution</u>: this plant has 
been found to contain a highly mutagenic Pyrrolizidine alkaloid which can 
cause liver disease, particularly in children. One child is on record 
for having died of liver disease because the mother drank coltsfoot tea 
during pregnancy, but there may be many unreported cases.

<h2>Dandelion</h2>

<img src="img/dy_dande06e.jpg" alt="Dandelion Leaves" class=mrg></a>
[Dent-de-lion (Old French), Pissenlit (French), <i>Taraxacum 
officinale</i>]
<p>
Originating in Eurasia and now infesting lawns worldwide, this common 
weed is a highly successful member of the vast daisy family 
(<i>Asteraceae</i>). Its long taproot makes it very difficult to eradicate 
and its efficient windblown seed dispersal system assures reinfection. It 
prefers temperate climate and moist soil, which is why it has such an 
affinity for lawns. The photo specimen leaves were up to 14 inches long, but 
they are sold up to about 16 inches.</p>
<p>The plant has both medicinal and culinary value. Young leaves are used 
raw in salads while older ones are more often cooked or added to soups. . 
Under their bitterness the leaves have considerable sweetness and have a 
particular affinity for eggs. Roots are used, as are chicory roots, to make 
a coffee substitute, and flower heads are used to make dandelion wine. The 
leaves are a strong diuretic, thus the French name Pissenlit (wet the bed).
Herbalists consider dandelion a general tonic and "blood cleanser".

<p>
This low flowering herb is native to western, central and northern 
Europe, but is now common in the Americas and Australasia, and other 
temperate regions. It is often considered a troublesome weed, particularly 
in lawns. Young leaves can be eaten raw in salads or cooked as a potherb. 
Leaves become more astringent as they age. Flower buds and petals are 
used in sandwiches, soups and salads.

<br><img src="img/dy_chcress02e.jpg" alt="Indian Aster Leaves" class=mrg>
[Ma Lan Tou (China); Chinese Cress (frozen packages from China); 
<i>Kalimeris indica</i>]
<p>
This plant is most common in China, Korea and Japan, but has been 
introduced to Hawaii and California by the large Asian populations 
in those states. It has a long history as a green leafy vegetable 
in Asia, with a unique flavor. It is particularly popular south of the 
Yangtze River in China. The photo is of three leaves carefully unraveled 
from a mass of frozen leaves and tender stems. The flowers look just 
like the Common Daisy except the petals are sometimes pale purple 
rather than white.</p>
<p>The taste is similar to Chrysanthemum leaves, but milder, and it's 
main use seems to be for making various salads combined with tofu. I 
haven't yet seen it fresh here in Los Angeles, but the Asian markets 
carry it frozen labeled "Chinese Cress", a name which more properly 
belongs to Shepherds Purse (<i>Capsella bursa-pastoris</i>) in the 
cabbage family.  The whole plant, particularly the root, is used in 
traditional Chinese medicine.

<i>Porophyllum ruderale</i>]
<p>
Native to Mexico and South America, this plant, despite the English name 
"Bolivian Coriander", is not at all related to Coriander. Also note that 
it is one of two similarly used and closely related plants called 
P&aacute;palo. The other one, with long thin leaves, is 
<a href="dy_herbs.html#papalo"><i>P. linaria</i></a>. This plant grows to 5 feet high 
and 3 feet across. It is used as a culinary herb by many cuisines through 
its range, and is very popular in Pueblo in central Mexico. Some is now 
grown for the Southern California market.

[Pipicha, Pepicha, Tepicha, Escobeta, Chepiche, Cola de coyote (Mexico); 
P&aacute;palo (incorrect): <i>Porophyllum linaria</i>]
<p>
This plant visually resembles tarragon, but it doesn't taste like 
tarragon - well, maybe just a hint. It is native to Mexico and used in 
Mexican cuisine, often in meat dishes. Fresh leaves are also used as a 
table condiment, particularly in Pueblo in central Mexico. The flavor is 
similar to that of its close relative <a href="dy_herbs.html#quillq">P&aacute;palo</a>, 
but not quite as strong. It has been described as similar to Cilantro 
but with overtones of Lemon and Anise.  The photo specimens were sold as 
stems about 13-1/2 inches long, with leaves about 1.4 inches long and 
0.18 inch wide. They were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles. Picked just before flowering, they had a few unopened 
purple flower buds. Note that this herb is sometimes called P&aacute;palo, 
a name that more properly belongs to the very closely related broader 
leafed herb <a href="dy_herbs.html#quillq"><i>P. ruderale</i></a>.

<p>
This Chamomile is native to North America from Alaska to Northern California 
and east to Newfoundland, and to Northeastern Asia. It is used medicinally 
similarly to other chamomiles. The flower heads, which have no petals, are 
edible, used in salads, but may become bitter as they mature.

<br><img src="img/dy_stevia03k.jpg" alt="Stevia Plant" class=mrg>
[Sweetleaf; <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>]
<p>
This plant, native to Paraguay and Brazil, is noted for the extreme 
sweetness of its leaves - up to 45 times sweeter than sugar. Extracts are 
up to 300 times sweeter than sugar and are extremely low in carbohydrates 
and calories. These characteristics make it very desirable as a general 
sweetener.</p>
<p>Since 2008, extracts have been legal as dietary supplements and food 
additives in the United States, and since 2011 in the European Union, but 
not yet in table packets as in Japan. It is available as a food additive 
in Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, among others, and as a dietary 
supplement in Canada. Growing the plant is legal in most countries. The 
FDA has been very cautious, because they fear Americans will overdo stevia 
(like they do with any other "in" substance). The FDA did receive an 
anonymous toxicity report (probably sponsored by the artificial sweetener 
industry) but no conclusive dangers have yet been confirmed.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="tarag">Tarragon</h2>
<br>Tarragon is native to the Northern Hemisphere from Eastern Europe 
across Asia in cooler climates. It was probably introduced to Western 
North America by early migrants and now grows as far south as a little 
below the Mexican border. Tarragon is much used in French cuisine where 
it is an essential ingredient for  B&eacute;rnaise Sauce and mixed with 
other herbs (typically chives, chervil and parsley) for the boquet 
called "fines herbes". It is also used in many other cuisines, 
particularly that of Georgia. Because dried tarragon is useless the 
flavor is often preserved in vinegar (tarragon vinegar) for use when 
out of season.<p></p>

   [Estragon (French and other); <i>Artemisia dracunculus</i>]
   <p>
   French tarragon is greatly preferred to Russian but is rarely 
   available in the U.S. because it's so hard to grow. Not only can it 
   not be propagated from seed, but it can't grow long in the same place 
   because it poisons its own soil. It must be propagated by root 
   division in the spring and planted in fresh soil. The leaves of 
   French Tarragon are whiter and narrower than those of the Russian. 
   It is thought to be a mutant form of the Russian. &nbsp; <small>

   <br><img src="img/hb_tarragonrus01e.jpg" alt="Leafy sprigs of Russian Tarragon" class=mrg>
   [<i>Artemisia dracunculoides</i>]
   <p>Russian tarragon is more closely related to the wild form 
   (originally from Siberia) than the French, but considered inferior in 
   flavor. Unfortunately it's what you'll always find in the stores 
   because it's much more robust, easier to grow and can be grown from 
   seed. Russian Tarragon leaves are wider and a fresher green color than 
   those of French Tarragon. Russian tarragon looses flavor as it ages, 
   but that found in markets here in Southern California is quite 
   consistent, so I presume it is being treated as an annual and planted 
   from seed every year.

   Native to Mexico and Central America, this small shrub grows well in 
   dryer and hotter regions where French and Russian tarragon would die. 
   The leaves, which are medium green rather than blue-green as with 
   French and Russian tarragon, are used as an herb, and are considered 
   a better substitute for French Tarragon than the Russian.</p>
   <p>Dried leaves are used as a tea, and are burned as an insect 
   repellant. It is also burned as an incense, which is supposed to have 
   some mind altering effect. The flowers are used in ceremonies and 
   offerings during the Mexican "Day of the Dead".  &nbsp; <small>Photo

   <p>
   Wormwood, native to temperate regions of Eurasia and Africa, has a long 
   history as a bitter herb, medicinal, and flavoring for beverages (particularly 
   Absinthe, Vermouth and various bitters, and Mexican Yolixpa). It is also 
   sometimes used in beer in place of hops. It is now naturalized in much of 
   North America. The Mexican variety is all but identical and some botanists 
   think it's just a variant of the same species.</p>
   <p>In Mexico it is dried and smoked for an effect similar to that of marijuana 
   (1 to 3 grams). Taken internally 4 grams (dried) can expel parasitic worms 
   (thus the name "wormwood") and larger doses can induce abortion. Wormwood oil 
   is highly toxic, but the amounts used in beverages are too small to cause 
   problems. I did, however, read of one young man who, upon hearing it was the 
   active ingredient in Absinthe, took some straight wormwood oil to experience 
   a high. His experience was more of the near death kind. The photo

   Native to Southern Europe, this herb is most famous for hanging in 
   closets to keep moths away, and as a deodorizing strewing herb, 
   particularly for bedrooms, as it was thought to have aphrodisiac 
   properties. As a culinary herb it has been used (sparingly) to flavor 
   pastries and puddings, and is still in use in parts of Italy.

   <p>
   This herb is native to temperate Europe, Asia, Northern Africa and Alaska, 
   but has been naturalized in other parts of North America. Mugwort looks 
   a lot like wormwood, but the leaves are darker on top than underneath 
   while wormwood is about the same color top and bottom. 
   This herb, with a slightly bitter taste, is used to season fish and meat, 
   especially game. In Germany it is traditionally used to season the 
   Christmas goose. In Asia, Mugworts are used to color and flavor 
   glutinous rice dumplings (Mochi) and some Korean noodles. In Japan, 
   young leaves are used as a pot herb and sometimes raw in salads. Dried 
   leaves and flower heads are used for an herbal tea. Mugwort was formerly 
   used as the bitter flavoring for beer, but was replaced by hops, which 
   have the advantage of being strongly anti-bacterial.

   This plant is native to California and about 200 miles into Baja 
   California, Mexico. It is a member of the coastal scrub through most 
   of its range, but goes far inland in some regions of the state.
   Sagebrush is not at all related to the herb Sage (which also grows 
   profusely in California), but it can also be used as a seasoning herb, 
   and be used to make herb teas. It once had wide usage as a medicinal 
   by the Indian tribes of Southern California, particularly for colds,  
   menstrual cramps and labor pains.

This semi-desert plant is native to the Levant, Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, 
Armenia and Anatolia. In the region it is gathered by Muslims, Christians, 
Druze and Sephardic Jews alike, and sold in some markets. When the plant 
is young the leaves are fairly tender and edible, but still need to be 
de-thorned. In one popular dish it is covered in minced meat and fried 
in olive oil, then simmered with lemon juice. It is also used for 
medicinal purposes.

This perennial herb is common in mountain regions of China, Japan. the 
Russian East, and particularly Korea. It is in cultivation in Korea,
where the young, tender stems are considered a welcome harbinger of 
Spring. The rest of the year, dried shoots are used. It has a unique 
herbal aroma and a pleasant bitterness.</p>

These herbaceous plants are native to western North America from British 
Columbia south to California and east to the Dakotas. They were once 
far more common than they are today and were important to the American 
Indians. They have been greatly reduced by over-grazing and trampling. 
Seeds were ground for breads and cakes, and for cooking oil. The tap 
roots were eaten both raw and cooked. The foliage is edible but is 
bitter with a pine resin scent.

Snow Bush, a shrub growing to 3 feet high, is used similarly as a 
culinary herb. It is native to South Africa, and when the profuse white 
flowers have finished and it's gone to seed, it looks <u>really</u> 
snowy, completely covered with white woolly puffs where the flowers had 
been. Livestock, particularly sheep, that have grazed on this plant are 
prized for their flavor. This plant is also used as a medicinal and as

<p>
H. radicata is native to Europe, but has been introduced to the Americas, 
Japan, Australia and New Zealand. It can often be a troublesome weed, and 
is listed as a noxious weed in Washington State. H. brasiliensis is 
native to South America, but is also now a common weed in the United 
States, particularly in the southeast. Cat's Ear is easily recognized from 
it's low lying basal rosette of deeply toothed leaves and tall, solid 
and branching flower stems. H. radicata leaves are quite hairy on the 
underside, H. brasiliensis only a little hairy.</p>
<p>All parts of the plant are edible, either raw in salads or cooked as 
greens, but the leaves are most often used. They tend to be bland and 
only occasionally have bitterness. The root of H. radicata is most often 
roasted for use as a coffee substitute. The photo specimen is of H. 
brisiliensis.

[Giant butterburr, Bog Rhubarb, Sweet coltsfoot; <i>Petasites 
japonicus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Petasites frigidus</i> (Arctic 
Butterburr)]
<p>
Native to Japan, Korea, Russia's Sakhalin Island and parts of northeastern 
China, this plant has been introduced to western Canada and Washington 
State by Japanese immigrants. 
This is a very strange plant. It starts out at the end of winter putting 
up flower head shoots that look sort of like a light green cauliflower 
(see photo). The flower heads rise on a stalk and spread out. These are 
followed by huge rhubarb like stalks more than 3 feet long with leaves 
over 2 feet across, but round, not arrowhead shaped like rhubarb.</p>
<p>The stems are eaten in Japan and Korea. The traditional preparation 
in Japan is to treat them with ashes or baking soda, then soak in water 
to reduce astringency. The back side is very stringy, worse than celery, 
so after a brief boiling the strings are peeled off. The stems can then 
be cooked like a vegetable (red stems are not considered suitable, only 
green). In Korea, steamed or boiled stems are wrung out, then seasoned 
with sesame or perilla oil and served as a side dish. The young flower 
heads can be fried as tempura. They may also be chopped and stir fried 
with miso to make a condiment for rice.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids 
that can cause cumulative liver damage and another known to be 
carcinogenic, so proper preparation is important to reduce their 
concentration.

Most goldenrods are native to North America, mostly east of the Rocky 
Mountains and from central Canada to Florida, but have become invasives 
in East Asia and Germany. There is one goldenrod widespread in Europe, 
<i>Solidago virgaurea</i>, used medicinally. Young goldenrod leaves are 
edible, and seeds, particularly of <i>S. nemoralis</i>, were used by 
American Indians for food. Goldenrod is also often included in herbal 
teas, but the main culinary use for goldenrod is in the production of 
honey by bees. Goldenrod is often blamed for causing hay fever, but it 
is actually caused by ragweed which blooms at the same time. The photo 
is of <i>S. gigantea</i>, found in most of North America east of the 
Rockey Mountains.

<p>
This plant is native to northern Brazil, but it is planted as a decorative 
in various parts of the world and extracts are used as a flavoring 
worldwide. In Brazil, small amounts of fresh leaves are added to salads 
for a unique flavor. Leaves combined with garlic and chilis are a popular 
ingredient in stews.</p>
<p>The flower buds have a grassy taste, but provide a numbing or 
tingling effect in the mouth similar to the very unrelated Sichuan 
Peppercorns of southern China. A major reason for using the extracts, 
which have a somewhat citrus aroma, is that they provide a strong mouth 
watering effect along with the tingly sensation. The plant and extracts 
also have medicinal uses, particularly for toothache (Sichuan Peppercorn 
and other Prickly Ash fruits are also used for this purpose).

[Salt Marsh Fleabane, Shrubby Camphorweed; <i>Pluchea odorata</i>]
<p>
Native to southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean 
and parts of northern South America, this three foot shrub is found in 
moist, often saline coastal environments. It has been introduced to 
Hawaii and is a noxious weed there. In parts of the Caribbean this is 
the most popular plant for herbal teas.

This plant is used as a vegetable, fresh and dried, in Western Nigeria, 
South Africa, Yemen and some islands in the Indian Ocean. It is very 
similar to the closely related Redflower Ragweed [Ebolo, Efo Ebolo 
(Nigeria) <i>Crassocephalum crepidioides</i>] which is better known.
