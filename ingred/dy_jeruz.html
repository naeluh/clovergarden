<p>
"Sunchokes", as they are now most frequently marketed, are the root tubers 
of a variety of sunflower. This plant is aggressively productive but the 
tubers have been prevented from becoming a major food crop by having a 
more distinctive flavor than potatoes, and being 75% inulin rather than 
starch (of which they have none). This can produce flatulence and gastric 
distress in persons not accustomed to consuming inulin. Others consider 
inulin an important health food. They also have a graying problem after 
cooking due to high iron content. Both these problems are treated below
</p>

<p><i>H. tuberosus</i> was used similarly to the Jerusalem Artichoke by 
the Plains Indians, but it is no longer in use, the Plains Indians having 
been driven from the land.</p>

<p>The name "Jerusalem Artichoke" has been debated for some time. 
The "Artichoke" part of the name comes from the cooked root supposedly 
tasting much like artichoke heart. This was reported by by explorer 
Samuel de Champlain in the very early 1600s, and it stuck. The 
Jerusalem part is most often blamed on an English corruption of the 
Italian word <i>girasole</i>, as the English are wont to do with foreign 
words. Problem: the Italians apparently didn't apply the term girasole 
to the sunflower until about 100 years after the English were calling 
this root tuber "Jerusalem Artichoke".</p>

<p>The most probable explanation is an English corruption of the name 
of a Dutch town, Terneuzen, from where the tubers were probably first 
exported to England. The English name appears about 4 years after start 
of significant production by the Dutch, who were exporting a lot of 
produce to England at the time.</p>

<p>The French name, <i>Topinambour</i>, used also in other European 
countries, was a marketing ploy. Some Indians of the tribe called 
Topenambaux, from Brazil were visiting Europe and getting a lot of 
publicity about the time these root tubers arrived in France in quantity. 
Hawkers exploited the publicity, and for about 300 years the French 
presumed these came from South America, not Canada.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as with beans, most people can build up tolerance to 
inulin if they eat enough of it, their gut flora adjusts to the inulin 
and breaks it down before it gets to the large intestine. The same can 
be seen with people who eat a lot of beans, the flatulence problem is 
greatly reduced.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Methods of reducing the flatulence problem 
were researched and summarized by Harold McGee in his book 
<i>The Curious Cook</i> (<a href="../recipes/biblio.html">tcc78</a>). 
The quickest method is to slice the Sunchokes and then boil them in 
lots of water for about 15 minutes before using them in a recipe. If 
you want them to stay crisper, put some Citric Acid (1/4 t per quart) or 
Lemon Juice (1 T per quart) in the water before adding the Sunchokes 
(you'll need some later anyway).

<p>Other methods are aging under refrigeration for months, steaming in 
a 200&deg;F/93&deg;C oven for 24 hours (the American Indians used pit 
steaming overnight). These treatments result in a sweeter tuber because 
they break a lot of the inulin down into digestible fructose.</p> 

<p>Sunchokes can also be deep fried, similarly to potato chips and 
French fries.</p>

<p>The problem with them graying after cooking is much easier to solve 
than the inulin problem. If you want tender slices, add Citric Acid 
(1/4 t per quart of water) or Lemon Juice (1 Tablespoon per quart of 
water) for the last 5 minutes of boiling. If you want crisper slices, 
add the Citric Acid or Lemon Juice to the water before adding the tuber 
slices. Howard McGee used Cream of Tarter (1/4 t per quart) but that 
isn't so commonly found in kitchens around here.</p>
