<p>
   This is <a href="dy_stemletz.html"><b>Stem Lettuce</b></a>, shaved 
   and dried. It is called "Mountain Jellyfish" because it is crunchy, 
   like jellyfish, when rehydrated. "Sound Vegetable" comes from the 
   same crunchiness. "Tribute Vegetable" is because someone once served 
   some to a Chinese emperor. The emperor liked it and demanded it as 
   tribute. It is much liked in stir fries, once rehydrated.s</p>
   <p>The photo specimen was purchased from a large Asian market in 
   Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2016 U.S. $0.50 per 6 ounce package (on 
   sale - expect higher). Ingred: Tribute Vegetable, Salt, Sulfur 
   Dioxide, FD&amp;C Blue-1 and Yellow-5.</p>

The photo to the left shows Tribute Vegetable rehydrated, trimmed and 
cut, ready for recipes. Rehydrated and trimmed (the leaves are generally 
discarded) the weight will be about 2.8 times the dry weight.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This dried vegetable has started becoming more 
available in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles, packaged in 6 ounce 
bags. Some Chinatowns have dry markets where this vegetable can be 
found tied into bundles and unpackaged.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Dried in a sealed plastic pouch, it should 
last up to a year. Once rehydrated it can be refrigerated for up to 
a week.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Submerge in cool water. Soak a couple of hours, 
changing the water if it looks discolored. Trim away leaves (usually 
done for appearance) and cut into lengths appropriate to your recipe, 
usually 1-1/2 to 2 inches.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The rehydrated vegetable is often served 
without cooking as a dressed salad. It is also often used in stir fries.
