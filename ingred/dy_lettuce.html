<span class=bg>Daisies (<i>Asteraceae</i> (was <i>Compositae</i>)) are 
the dominant provider of edible summer greens, particularly the lettuces 
and chicories. They're not quite as stuffed full of nutritional goodness 
as cabbages, but still plenty good for you, and they make a lot of 
pleasant salads.</span>

   [Italian Dandelion, Cutting Chicory, <i>C. intybus</i>]
   <p>
   A mildly bitter chicory popular in Italy and widely available in the 
   USA. There are also cultivars with red stems, and sometimes white 
   ones will show red streaks. Chicory is generally used raw to pep up 
   salads with fairly heavy dressings, but can also be cooked and will then 
   be milder. The photo specimen was 16 inches long and weighed 13 ounces.

   <p>
   Chicory Root has long been an adulterant in coffee, and sometimes a 
   substitute. In East Germany, <i>Mischkaffee</i>, a mixture of chicory, 
   sugar beet and rye, was used during a coffee shortage before the fall 
   of the Berlin Wall. Chicory root is used industrially for extracting 
   inulin, now being promoted as a "prebiotic" in the health food market. 
   Some beer brewers use roasted chickory to make their stout more 
   "stout".   &nbsp; <small>Photo by

   [Witloof, French Endive, <i>Cichorium intybus</i>]
   <p>
   This very bitter chicory is pulled from the field and the green top cut 
   off. Replanted in darkness the roots grow new leaves which lack green 
   chlorophyll and are also much less bitter. This process explains the 
   rather high price, but the flavor/texture combination just can't be 
   found elsewhere and is essential to some recipes. The photo specimen 
   was 5 inches long and weighed 4-3/4 ounces.

   <h2 id="endivbr">Belgian Endive - Red</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_endivebr02e.jpg" alt="Heads of Red Belgian Endives" class=mrg>
   Eager to entertain (and pick up a little yuppie cash), California 
   growers are now marketing a red variety of Belgian Endive. I found the 
   taste indistinguishable from the regular white but the heads were 
   smaller, looser and more expensive. Use it if the color is important 
   to you. The photo specimens were 5 inches long and weighed 2-1/4 
   ounces each.

   <i>Cichorium endivia</i> var <i>crispum</i>]
   <p>
   A plant from India (Cichorium endivia) valued as a salad green. The 
   Curly variety has fairly narrow leaves with ruffled edges while on the 
   Fris&eacute;e variety the leaf is both curly and very deeply cut making it 
   quite frizzy. Of course there are many cultivars ranging from one extreme 
   to the other.

   [Batavian Endive, Bavarian Endive, Wide leaf Endive; 
   <i>Cichorium endivia</i> var <i>latifolia</i>]
   <p>
   Escarole is less bitter than most chicories and has broad light green 
   leaves and a very flat head. It is commonly used as a salad green but 
   more mature heads may be cooked as a green side dish.
   The photo specimen was 13 inches across and weighed 13 ounces.

   [<i>Cichorium intybus</i>]
   <p>
   A moderately bitter chicory that looks like a head of lettuce in the 
   field. In Italy they have also an all white version but in the US the 
   spherical red and white Radicchio di Chioggia variety is most common 
   but an elongated red and white <a href="dy_lettuce.html#radicct">Treviso</a> variety 
   that looks like a big red Belgian endive is also seen. This is a 
   fairly expensive lettuce because of the production method. In the 
   field they are green. To make them purely red and white they are 
   pulled from the ground and put in water in a dark room until the 
   chlorophyll has faded from lack of light.  This is labor and capital 
   intensive and a lot of outer leaves are lost in the process resulting 
   in the high price. The larger of the photo specimens was 4 inches 
   diameter and weighed 9-1/2 ounces.

   <p>
   This is simply an elongated variety of the regular round 
   <a href="dy_lettuce.html#radicc">Radicchio di Chioggia</a>. It tastes the same and 
   can be used the same unless leaf shape is important to your 
   application, but it's likely to be even more expensive. The photo 
   specimens was 7 inches long, 2-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 7 
   ounces.

<h2 id="lett" class=lrg>Lettuce</h2>

<p>[<i>Lactuca sativa</i>] &nbsp; The first depiction of lettuce is from 
Egypt just under 4000 years ago, but it had been in use there in much 
earlier times. Egyptian lettuce was similar to our wild lettuce, and 
similarly reputed to have opiate (and aphrodisiac) properties. Mature 
lettuce "bolts", sending up a central stalk with many branches holding 
small dandelion-like flowers. It becomes more bitter and opiate-like 
when it bolts. Lettuce is a significant source of Lithium.</p>

   <h2 id="butter">Butter Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_letbutter01h.jpg" alt="Head of Butter Lettuce" class=mrg>
   [Butterhead, Boston, Bib or Limestone]
   <p>
   These are very tender loose leaf lettuces often packed in individual 
   plastic containers to protect them from damage. Of the two main 
   varieties, Bib Lettuce is the smaller and considered the more flavorful, 
   but Boston Lettuce is a suitable substitute. Packages I've seen in 
   Southern California do not use either designation but simply call the 
   contents "Butter Lettuce". The package often includes roots and a 
   hydroponic growing matrix to extend shelf life.
   <br class=cll>

   <h2 id="green">Green Leaf Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_letgreen01k.jpg" alt="Head of Green Leaf Lettuce" class=mrg>
   Green Leaf is too tender to be a good industrial product but it's a very 
   fine base for quality salads. Plenty of lettuce flavor with very moderate 
   bitterness and good color. The photo specimen, squished a bit flat in 
   shipping, as they always are, was 14 inches wide, 10 inches from stem to 
   tip and weighed 13 ounces.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2 id="ice">Iceberg Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_leticebrg02d.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Heads of Iceberg Lettuce" class=mrg>
   [Crisphead Lettuce]
   <p>
   Crisphead is actually the correct name, but nobody calls it that. 
   This head lettuce is the darling of the lettuce industry and the fast 
   food chains. It's easy to handle and stands up well to processing and 
   shipping abuse. The fast food people like it because it's easy to 
   shred, bulks up a salad well and stays crisp and bulky for quite a 
   while after shredding.</p>
   <p>This lettuce was originally (and still is) grown in Salinas, 
   California. It was put on trains, packed with ice and shipped as far 
   as Maine year round, thus called "iceberg lettuce". It was very much 
   welcomed during New England winters.</p>
   <p>Crisphead lettuce contains a lot of water and is 1/5th or less 
   nutritious as loose leaf lettuce. It has rather little lettuce flavor 
   or bitterness but can be useful for recipes that call for lettuce 
   wedges and such or where texture is more important than flavor or 
   nutrition. It's also easy to store in the fridge compared to leaf 
   lettuce. The photo specimen (left), a medium size one, was 5-1/4 
   inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 9-5/8 ounces.

   <h2 id="red">Red Leaf Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_letred01k.jpg" alt="Head of Red Leaf Lettuce" class=mrg>
   Very similar to <a href="dy_lettuce.html#green">Green Leaf Lettuce</a> except for the 
   color. For taste and texture the two are interchangeable. The color is 
   caused by anthocyanin pigments which are the same antioxidants found 
   in red cabbage and red wine.

   <h2 id="cos">Romaine Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_letromaine02h.jpg" alt="Head of Romaine Lettuce" class=mrg>
   [Cos Lettuce]<p>
   The second most common lettuce in America after <a href="dy_lettuce.html#ice">Iceberg</a> 
   and the sturdiest of the leaf lettuces. It's shape and stiffness make it 
   relatively easy to handle but it does have quite a bit more lettuce flavor 
   than iceberg does. It is called for by many recipes where the leaf shape 
   and stiffness is desirable. The photo specimen was 13 inches high. It is 
   often used as a foundation layer on a platter with the featured items 
   placed over it.

   <h2 id="ruby">Ruby Lettuce</h2>
   <br><img src="img/dy_letruby01h.jpg" alt="Head of Ruby Lettuce" class=mrg>
   Pretty much the same as <a href="dy_lettuce.html#red">Red Leaf Lettuce</a> except for 
   being all deep red with almost no green. For taste and texture the two are 
   interchangeable. The color is caused by anthocyanin pigments which are the

   <br><img src="img/dy_achoy01e.jpg" alt="A-Choy Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Taiwan Lettuce, Chinese Lettuce, Sword Lettuce; Yu Mai Tsai (China)]
   <p>
   This is the only common leaf lettuce in China, and is actually the 
   crown leaves from Stem Lettuce (see next paragraph). It is popular in 
   stir fries in Taiwan, and is always cooked - raw salads are not eaten 
   in China due to unsanitary growing conditions. This lettuce is now 
   widely available in markets serving a Chinese community - well, it is 
   here in Southern California anyway. It is much like a romaine 
   lettuce, but more bitter
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Stem Lettuce</h2>
   <br><a href="dy_stemletz.html">
   <img src="img/dy_letstem07e.jpg" alt="Lettuce Stems w/Leaves" class=mrg></a>

   Lettuce; Wosun, Woju (China); <i>L. sativa</i> var <i>asparagina</i> 
   alt var <i>augustana</i>, var <i>angustata</i>]
   <p>
   This lettuce is grown mainly for its stem, which is peeled and sliced 
   or diced and used in stir fries. It is also often pickled. The flavor 
   is fairly mild, much like a slightly bitter cucumber, so it's usually 
   paired with stronger flavored items. The photo specimens were about 
   17 inches long (not counting leaves), 1.6 inches diameter and weighed 
   about 8 ounces each. The form shown with a crown of leaves is how it 
   is generally sold, but you'll notice the tip with the young more 
   tender leaves has been removed. It is sold separately as A-Choy (see 
   above). The older leaves still attached are like Romaine leaves but 
   tougher and more bitter, but they do stand up better to cooking. The 
   Chinese do not eat raw greens for reasons you'd probably rather not 
   dwell on.

   <p>
   This is <a href="dy_stemletz.html"><b>Stem Lettuce</b></a>, shaved 
   and dried. It is called "Mountain Jellyfish" because it is crunchy, 
   like jellyfish, when rehydrated. "Sound Vegetable" comes from the 
   same crunchiness. "Tribute Vegetable" is because someone once served  
   some to a Chinese emperor, and the emperor liked it, demanding more 
   as tribute. It is much liked in stir fries, once rehydrated. The 
   photo specimen was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
   (Alhambra) for 2016 U.S. $0.50 per 6 ounce package (on sale - expect 
   higher).

   <br><img src="img/dy_letwild01h.jpg" alt="Wild Lettuce Growing Wild" class=mrg>
   [Prickly Lettuce, <i>Lactuca serriola</i>]
   <p>
   This is where it all came from, a wild plant with a bitter milky sap. 
   When the plant matures it will "bolt", sending up a central stalk 
   topped with a group of small dandelion-like flowers. The bitter sap 
   is a mild opiate, particularly when the lettuce bolts. The photo shows 
   leaves of very young plants, the leaf margins become deeply cut, 
   ragged and pointy looking.</p>
   <p>While wild lettuce is much stronger, other loose-leaf lettuces have 
   similar properties. Some years back I observed that the loose-leaf 
   lettuce in a friend's garden had bolted. Connie remarked that it 
   wasn't as good as before but they were still using it. They were 
   also wondering why they were falling asleep right after their salad 
   (served at the end of dinner in their household).</p>
   <p>My pigeons used to rip into the wild lettuce, then go and flake out 
   on the roof, often lying upside-down. Unfortunately they can't do that 
   anymore - there are too many hawks now.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Lettuces vary a little in nutritional content, but they are all 
very high in vitamin A and beta carotene (which converts to vitamin 
A). The redder the variety, the more they have.  They also contain 
good quantities of Vitamin K, Vitamin C, foliates, zia-xanthin and 
B complex, as well as a good selection of minerals and antioxidants. 
Lettuces are all very low in calories (15 per 100 grams) and are fat 
free. They do contain oxalic acid, but only 0.33mg per 100 grams.
</p>
<p>Lettuces are known to help prevent osteoporosis and iron-deficiency 
anemia, and are suspected to be beneficial for cardiovascular disease, 
ARMD, Alzheimer's disease and cancers. Of course, all this is subject
