<h1>Papalo / Pipicha</h1>
<p>These two plants look totally different, yet are closely related, 
taste very similar and are used pretty much the same. Most North 
American recipes that call for either of these recommend Cilantro as 
a substitute, but if you can add a few leaves of Rue, the flavor will 
be more similar.</p>

  [Bolivian Coriander; P&aacute;palo (Mexico); Quillqui&ntilde;a (Bolivia); 
  Yerba Porosa, Killi, Tepegua, p&aacute;paloquelite: 
  <i>Porophyllum ruderale</i>]
<p>
Native to Mexico and South America, this plant, despite the English name 
"Bolivian Coriander", is not at all related to Coriander. Also note that 
it is one of two similarly used and closely related plants called 
P&aacute;palo. The other one, with long thin leaves, is <i>P. linaria</i>. 
This plant grows to 5 feet high and 3 feet across. It is used as a culinary 
herb by many cuisines through its range, and is very popular in Pueblo in 
central Mexico.</p>
<p>Flavor is said to be like a mix of arugula, cilantro and rue, a 
reasonable description, but the rue is a bit stronger than the other 
flavors. The flavor is also slightly resinous. This herb is often used 
in salsas and sandwiches. Note the wavy edges of the leaves. when it 
starts to flower, the leaves become more elongated and the waves deeper. 
Another interesting feature is that the leaves have a number of pinhole 
like pores, thus "Yerba Porosa". Some is now grown in North America to 
supply street sandwich vendors in Los Angeles and New York. I just love 
this herb as a seasoning in hamburger patties. The photo specimens were 
purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles. Leaves were 
up to 2-7/8 inches wide.

<h2>Pipicha</h2>

  [Pipicha, Pepicha, Tepicha, Escobeta, Chepiche, Cola de coyote (Mexico); 
  P&aacute;palo (incorrect): <i>Porophyllum linaria</i>]
<p>
This plant visually resembles tarragon, but it doesn't taste like 
tarragon - well, maybe just a hint. It is native to Mexico and used in 
Mexican cuisine, often in meat dishes. Fresh leaves are also used as a 
table condiment, particularly in Pueblo in central Mexico. The flavor is 
similar to that of its close relative <i>P&aacute;palo</i>, 
but not quite as strong. It has been described as similar to Cilantro 
but with overtones of Lemon and Anise.  The photo specimens were sold as 
stems about 13-1/2 inches long, with leaves about 1.4 inches long and 
0.18 inch wide. They were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles. Picked just before flowering, they had a few unopened 
purple flower buds. Note that this herb is sometimes called P&aacute;palo, 
a name that more properly belongs to the very closely related broader 
leafed herb <i>P. ruderale</i>.
