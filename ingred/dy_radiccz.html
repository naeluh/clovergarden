[<i>Cichorium intybus</i>]
<p>
A moderately bitter chicory that looks like a head of lettuce in the 
field. In Italy they have also an all white version. In North America 
the spherical red and white Radicchio di Chioggia variety is most common, 
but an elongated red and white <a href="dy_radiccz.html#radicct">Treviso</a> variety 
that looks like a big red Belgian endive is also seen.</p>
<p>This is a fairly expensive lettuce because of the production method. 
In the field they are green. To make them purely red and white they are 
pulled from the ground and put in water in a dark room until the 
chlorophyll has faded from lack of light.  This is labor and capital 
intensive and a lot of outer leaves are lost in the process, resulting 
in the high price. It is generally sold as heads 3-1/2 to 4-1/2  inches 
diameter weighing 9 to 10 ounces. <small>Photo by Paolo Ciarlantini

Two forms are sold, the spherical being more common. They are essentially 
identical except for shape. On the left is the spherical <i>Radicchio di 
Chioggia</i> variety, and on the right is the new <i>Radicchip di 
Treviso</i> variety.
