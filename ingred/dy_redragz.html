<p>
While used as a green leafy vegetable in many tropical and subtropical 
regions, this plant is particularly popular in tropical Africa. The 
slightly succulent mucilaginous leaves and stems are cooked as a 
vegetable in soups and stews. They are valued for their slightly piney 
flavor. In Australia the leaves are eaten raw in salads, but may also be 
cooked. The roots are eaten with chili sauce in Thailand. Many parts of 
the plant are used medicinally, but internal use for either food or 
medicine should be in moderation, as the plant includes a number of 
nasty plant toxins, and needs more study.

This plant is used as a vegetable, fresh and dried, in Western Nigeria, 
South Africa, Yemen and some islands in the Indian Ocean. It is very 
similar to the closely related Redflower Ragweed [Ebolo, Efo Ebolo 
(Nigeria) <i>Crassocephalum crepidioides</i>] which is better known.
