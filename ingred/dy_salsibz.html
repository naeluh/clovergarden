[Black oyster plant, Spanish Salsify, Serpent root, Viper's grass; 
Schwarzwurzel (German); <i>Scorzonera hispanica</i>]

<p>Native to southeastern Europe, Anatolia, and the Levant, this vegetable is 
first mentioned in European literature as found in Aleppo Syria, in 1575. It 
is now grown mostly in Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Germany. It produces 
a taproot that can be up to a meter long and 2 centimeters (0.8 inch) in 
diameter.

<p>In cookbooks in English, I have seen this vegetable included in Danish 
root vegetable recipes as "Scorzonera". A possible substitute, (I haven't 
tried it yet) is <a href="dy_goboz.html"><b>Burdock / Gobo</b></a>, which 
is very available in Asian markets here in Southern California. It is a 
member of family <i>Asteraceae</i>, as are both Black and Common Salsify. 
See also <a href="dy_salsifz.html"><b>Common Salsify</b></a> 
(<i>Tragopogon porrifolius</i>), similarly used and better known in 
North America. It has purple flowers, while Black Salsify has yellow 
flowers.</p>

<p>Black Salsify is often cooked mixed with other root vegetables. It is 
also sometimes served alone with a white sauce in the same manner as 
White Asparagus. Boiled roots may be coated with batter and deep fried.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This plant is currently not well known in North 
America, and I've never seen it for sale here in Southern California. It 
is popular in the northwest quarter if Europe. Note that damaged roots 
start to decay rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The skin must be peeled off, but the root will then 
exude a sticky latex, so it is often boiled for 10 to 20 minutes before 
peeling.  Peeled raw, the root must be placed under acidulated water 
immediately to prevent discoloring.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Black Salsify contains useful amounts 
proteins, fats, asparagine, and choline, as well as the minerals potassium, 
calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Vitamins A, B1, E and C are also 
present, as is the polysaccharide inulin.<p></p>
