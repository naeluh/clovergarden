[Purple Salsify, Oyster Plant, Vegetable Oyster, Goatsbeard (not unique); 
<i>Tragopogon porrifolius</i>]
<p>
Native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, this plant has been introduced 
to other regions, and now grows wild in almost every state of North America 
(except the deep Southeast). Salsify has been known to herbalists since 
ancient times and has been grown not only for its flowers, but for edible 
roots and stems.  The roots are noted for tasting like oysters, thus the 
alternate names. The photo specimens were 20 inches long, the root parts 
being about 7 inches and almost 3/4 inch diameter at the top.</p>
<p>This vegetable was popular in England in the 18th century but today is 
eaten mostly in France, Italy and Russia. It has, however, in recent times 
often been displaced by <a href="dy_salsibz.html"><b>Black Salsify</b></a> 
(<i>Scorzonera hispanica</i>), a different genus with much broader leaves 
and yellow flowers rather than purple. </p>

<p>Salsify roots are the parts most eaten, and taste lightly of oysters 
but sweeter. Young flowering stems can be cooked similar to asparagus, 
and young leaves are also edible.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This plant is currently not well known in North 
America, but can occasionally be found at the stand of a specialty grower 
at local farmer's markets. It should be used soon, because damaged roots 
are very subject to decay.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; when peeled and/or cut, roots should be 
immediately submerged in water acidulated with citric acid or lemon juice 
to prevent them from discoloring.<p></p>
