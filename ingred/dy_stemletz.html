   This lettuce is grown mainly for its stem, which is peeled and sliced 
   or diced and used in stir fries. It is also often pickled. The flavor 
   is fairly mild, much like a slightly bitter cucumber, so it's usually 
   paired with stronger flavored items. The photo specimens were about 
   17 inches long (not counting leaves), 1.6 inches diameter and weighed 
   about 8 ounces each. The form shown with a crown of leaves is how it 
   is generally sold, but you'll notice the tip with the young more 
   tender leaves has been removed. It is sold separately as A-Choy. The 
   older leaves still attached are like Romaine leaves but tougher and 
   more bitter, but they do stand up better to cooking. The Chinese do 
   not eat raw greens for reasons you'd probably rather not dwell on.</p>

Stem lettuce is lightly flavored, so is as much a textural element as 
a flavor element. Because of its crispness, even with fairly long cooking, 
you will want to use it in fairly thin slices or smallish dice.</p>
<p>The photo to the left shows pickled stem lettuce, very common in Asian 
markets. It is pleasantly light and lightly crunchy, very easy to eat a 
whole jar at one sitting. Ingred: lettuce, sugar, soy sauce, water, msg.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Stem Lettuce can be found in most Asian produce 
markets, but tends to be seasonal. It's in good supply in late spring 
and early summer, spotty the rest of the year.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped in plastic, and not wet, it 
should last up to two weeks in the fridge. The leaves may wither, but 
they're not the part you use.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Stem Lettuce has a very tough outer layer which 
must be removed. Use a regular swivel vegetable peeler (I strongly 
prefer the "Y" shaped form). The tough layer is lighter in color so you 
can usually see if it is sufficiently peeled or not. Otherwise test with 
a fingernail which should pierce the flesh easily. Note that the pithy 
white core in the high part of the stem does not ever become tender 
enough to chew, but has little substance. Remove it if practical, but 
if not it's small and easy to just swallow.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Slices and cubes of stem lettuce are still 
"crisp tender" at 20 minutes of cooking. Depending on the texture you 
want, you may want to simmer them a bit before adding to a quickly 
cooked stir fry.<p></p>
