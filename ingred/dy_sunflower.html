<h1>Daisy Family - Seeds Roots <small>&amp;</small> Oils</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
This is sort of "catch all" page for members of the <b>Daisy Family</b> 
(<i>Asteraceae</i> (was <i>Compositae</i>)) that don't quite fit the 
other pages in this section. It isn't too orderly, but plants are 
kind of a disorderly bunch.  Some of the root plants listed here may 
provide greens as well as roots, but are primarily used as roots with 
greens a more incidental item.</p>

<h2>Sunflower Seeds</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_sunflower07e.jpg" alt="Sunflower Seeds in striped shells" class=mrg>
[<i>Helianthus annuus</i>]
<p>
Pictured are are the seeds of the giant sunflower, which grows flower 
heads that can be more than a foot across. The record height was 40 feet, 
achieved in Northern Italy, but they are normally less than 12 feet tall, 
The sunflower originated in Mexico, but by the time of Columbus it was 
grown as far north as the Mississippi valley. American Indians used it 
for food, oil and war paint.</p>
<p>The giant sunflower became widely planted in Russia and Ukraine because 
the oil from its seeds was approved by the Orthodox Church for use during 
Lent. Sunflower oil and eating sunflower seeds are now closely associated 
with Russia and the Black Sea region.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sunflower Seed Oil</h2>
<br><img src="img/oi_sunflower01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Sunflowr Seed Oil" class=mrg>
[<i>Helianthus annuus</i>]
<p>
Sunflower seed oil is called for in many recipes from Russia, Ukraine 
and the Black Sea region in general. This is because the Orthodox Church 
has not forbidden its use during lent and other "fast days". It will go 
to the high frying temperature of 450&deg;F/235&deg;C, but it is 72% 
polyunsaturated fats, so it degrades very rapidly into rancidity. The 
products of rancidity, aside from smelling and tasting bad, can be 
carcinogenic.</p>
<p>The fast food industry was urged by the do-gooders to use "vegetable" 
oils of this type instead of safe, durable beef tallow. The industry found 
these seed oils (including corn and soybean oil) degraded to unusability  
within a few hours (beef tallow would hold up for a month). Health 
issues aside, they could not tolerate the bad taste, smell, and the 
cost of changing their oil twice a day. Lacking other options, they 
turned to deadly trans fats instead.</p>
<p>Now that trans fats are known to be far more dangerous than beef 
tallow, the fast food industry is turning to genetically engineered "high 
oleic" seed oils, including sunflower. These oils mimic the composition 
of olive oil (olive oil is too expensive and in too limited supply for 
fast food use). These "high oleic" oils are not yet common in consumer 
markets.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we recommend using sunflower oil only as 
salad oil or for short, low temperature frying tasks. Definitely do 
not re-use this oil. Of course, our CloveGarden 
<a href="meddisclm.html">Medical Disclaimer</a> applies here.</p>

<h2>Jerusalem Artichoke / Sunchoke</h2>
<br><a href="dy_jeruz.html">
<img src="img/dy_jartichoke07h.jpg" alt="Sunchoke Root Tubers" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Sunroot; Topinambour (French and other European); <i>Helianthus 
tuberosus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Helianthus maximiliani</i> 
Maximilian sunflower]
</p><p>
"Sunchokes", as they are now most frequently marketed, are the root tubers 
of a variety of sunflower. This plant is aggressively productive but the 
tubers have been prevented from becoming a major food crop by having a 
more distinctive flavor than potatoes, and being 75% inulin rather than 
starch (of which they have none). This can produce flatulence and gastric 
distress in persons not accustomed to consuming inulin. Others consider 
inulin an important health food.</p>

<p><i>H. maximiliani</i> was used similarly to the Jerusalem Artichoke by 
the Plains Indians, but it is no longer in use, the Plains Indians having 
been driven from the land. For interesting details on the history, 
naming and best methods of culinary preparation of this interesting root 
tuber, see <a href="dy_jeruz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Prairie Sunflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_sunprar01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Prairie Sunflower Plants" class=mrg>
[<i>Helianthus petiolaris</i>]<p>
This widespread sunflower is found in all the south-central provinces of 
Canada and all of the United States except the deep southeast, and is 
often considered a weed. This taprooted annual grows to about 4 feet high
with flowers similar to those of the regular sunflower but much smaller. 
The seeds are edible but small. They can be ground into an oily meal, or 
can be used to make a kind of butter. I am not sure they are currently 
in use, but were probably used by American Indians.

<h2>Safflower</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_saflower0e.jpg" alt="Safflower Seeds, Dried Flower" class=mrg>
[Carthamine (19th century); <i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>]
<p>
Safflower has been cultivated since the time of Ancient Egypt for oil, seeds 
and color, both for dyes and to color food. Today, the largest producers are 
India, the United States and Mexico, primarily for oil pressed from the seeds. 
Seeds are often used in bird seed mixes (where the photo specimens came from) 
because squirrels don't like them.</p>
<p><b>Safflower Oil:</b> &nbsp; Two varieties are grown for oil. One produces 
oil very high in polyunsaturated fats, the other with a little more 
monounsaturated fats. The variety with more monounsaturated fats predominates 
as an edible oil, the other is used for paints in place of linseed oil, 
particularly for white as it has no tint.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Salsify - Common</h2>
<br><a href="dy_salsifz.html">
<img src="img/dy_salsify01e.jpg" alt="Whole Salsify Plants" class=mrg></a>
[Oyster Plant, Vegetable Oyster, Common Salsify, Purple Salsify, Goatsbeard: 
<i>Tragopogon porrifolius</i>]
<p>
Native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, this plant has been 
introduced to other regions, and now grows wild in almost every state of 
North America (except the deep Southeast). Salsify has been known to 
herbalists since ancient times and has been grown not only for its 
flowers, but for edible roots and stems.  The roots are noted for 
tasting like oysters, thus the alternate names.</p>
<p>This vegetable was popular in England in the 18th century but today 
is eaten mostly in France, Italy and Russia. It has, however, in recent 
times often been displaced by Spanish Salsify (Black Salsify, 
<i>Scorzonera hispanica</i>),  a different genus with much broader leaves 
and yellow flowers rather than purple. The photo specimens were 
20 inches long, the root parts being about 7 inches and almost 3/4 inch
diameter at the top. &nbsp; <a href="dy_salsifz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Salsify - Black</h2>
<br><a href="dy_salsibz.html">

[Spanish salsify, Black oyster plant, Serpent root, 
Viper's herb, Viper's grass, Scorzonera; <i>Scorzonera hispanica</i>]
<p>
Native to the Near East and souteastern Europe, this salsify has much 
wider leaves and longer roots than common salsify, and the roots 
are very dark brown with a corky bark. It is now grown mosltly in Belgium, 
France, Netherlands, and Germany. It has yellow flowers, while Common Salsify 
has purple flowers.

<h2>Burdock Root / Gobo</h2>
<br><a href="dy_goboz.html">
<img src="img/dy_burd11e.jpg" alt="Cut Burdock Root" class=mrg></a>
[Greater Burdock, Beggar's Buttons; Gobo (Japan); Ueong (Korea); 
Bardana, Garduna (Portugal); <i>Arctium lappa</i>]
<p>
This plant, native from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and from the 
British Isles to Japan, can grow to over 9 feet tall, with a tap root 
extending more than a yard into the ground. Burdock is usually grown 
in raised beds of soft soil because harvesting the roots would otherwise 
be very difficult.</p>
<p>While burdock was once a significant food item over much of Europe, 
it is no longer so much used there, but is very much used in East Asia, 
particularly Japan, Taiwan and Korea. It is also still used in Portugal, 
Italy, and Brazil. In Japan very young roots are cooked pickled and 
dyed orange for use in sushi bars, for what is called "Carrot Roll" 
here in California. Young leaves and stems are also edible.

<h2>Yac&oacute;n</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_yacon01h.jpg" alt="Yac&oacute;n Root Tubers" class=mrg>
[Peruvian ground apple; Jicama (Ecuador); <i>Smallanthus sonchifolius</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the Amazon side of the Andes Mountains of 
South America, from Colombia to northern Argentina. 	The storage roots, 
which may reach a weight of as much as 2 pounds, are sweet and juicy. 
Like Jicama (unrelated) they are most often eaten fresh and raw. The 
sweetness is from fructooligosaccharide, about half the sweetness of 
cane sugar, but totally indigestible, thus low in calories. Leaves are 
often used to make teas which are prebiotic and high in antioxidants.</p>
<p>Due to ability to build a market as a weight loss aid, and from it's 
diabetic and prebiotic characteristics, yac&oacute;n has been planted in 
southern Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. It spread from there to 
Japan, the Philippines, China and South Korea. Due to attention given it 
in Japan, it has now been introduced to the cities of South America, 
and is even sometimes seen in farmer's markets in the United States.

<h2>Dahlia</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_dahliac01h.jpg" alt="Red Dahlia Flower" class=mrg>
[<i>Dahlia coccinea</i>]
<p>
Dahlias, bushy plants that can grow to over 6 feet tall, are native 
primarily to Mexico, but also Central America and Colombia. Dahlia root 
tubers were long a staple of the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples in 
the region. Dahlias were first taken to Europe in hopes of using them as 
a food crop, but they didn't catch on. On the other hand, breeding 
decorative varieties very much did catch on. The unique genetics of the 
dahlia make possible in incredible variety of single and double flowers 
in many colors and sizes up to a foot across.</p>
<p><i>D. coccinea</i>, the red dahlia, is commonly used for culinary 
tubers. These tubers are still part of the regional cuisine of Oxaca, 
Mexico. Dahlia tubers are rich in inulin, a sugar that was used to 
treat diabetes until 1923 when insulin was developed. &nbsp;

<h2>Arrowweed</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_arroww01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Arrowweed Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Pluchea sericea</i>]
<p>
This plant is found in Southern California and Nevada, across New Mexico 
and Arizona to Texas and down into Mexico. It inhabits wetlands and 
dry regions that aren't too dry. It was use by American Indians for 
production of hunting arrows and for it's roots, which can be 
roasted and eaten.

<h2>Niger Seed</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_niger01k.jpg" alt="Niger Seed Flowers" class=mrg>
[Noog, Nug (Ethiopia); Valisalu, Valasulu, Uchellu, Gurellu, Karale 
(India); <i>Guizotia abyssinica</i>]
<p>
Native to the highlands of Ethiopia, this plant is important in the 
region for its long thin seeds, from which is pressed a cooking oil. 
Varieties have been developed for growing in North America, with 
registered varieties "EarlyBird" and "EarlyBird50". It is marketed as 
bird seed, and is particularly liked by finches. In southern India 
the seeds are used to make a dry chutney which accompanies chapatis 
(flat bread), and they are used as a spice in some curries.

<h2>Murnong</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_murnong01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Murnong Plant" class=mrg>
[Yam daisy; <i>Microseris lanceolata</i> (Australia) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Microseris scapigera</i> (New Zealand)]
<p>
This plant was once plentiful over much of Australia. There is a 
Tasmanian variety which is much smaller. Root tubers of this plant were 
very important to native Australians as food. Cattle, sheep and goats 
introduced by English colonists ate it almost to extinction, with similar 
effects on the native people. This was not a problem for English 
colonists, as deliberately starving native peoples to death was a 
favorite pastime (see Ireland, India, North America and other regions). 
Doing it accidentally was just a side benefit.</p>
<p>Native Australians cooked the root tubers by roasting and pit baking. 
The taste has been described as sweet and similar to coconut.
