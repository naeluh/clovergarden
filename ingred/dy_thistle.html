<h1>Thistles</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<b>Thistles</b> are a branch of the huge <a href="dy_daisy.html">
<b>Daisy</b></a> family (<i>Asteraceae</i> (was <i>Compositae</i>)) along 
with Lettuce and Sunflowers. Thistles are a bitter, prickly lot and few 
are eaten, but the flower of one, the Artichoke, is greatly prized and 
the leaf stems of a near relative are also used in Mediterranean 
recipes.</p>

<img src="img/dy_cardoon09d.jpg" alt="Bunch of Cardoon Stalks" class=mrg></a>
[Cardoni, Cardi; Chard (archaic), Wild Artichoke, Artichoke 
Thistle; <i>Cynara cardunculus</i>]
<p>
This thistle, closely related to the <a href="dy_thistle.html#arti">Globe 
Artichoke</a>, is native to the drier parts of the Mediterranean basin,  
from Portugal to Greece, and Morocco to Lybia. The large, fleshy leaf 
stems are widely used as a vegetable in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy 
and North Africa. The taste is complex, interesting and artichoke-like - 
if you have developed a taste for slightly bitter vegetables (a 
worthwhile taste to develop). 
&nbsp; <a href="dy_cardooz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>

<h3>Ecology:</h3> &nbsp; Cardoons are decorative, but should not be 
planted except where they will be carefully controlled. They are 
aggressive weeds with wind dispersed seeds, and have pushed out native 
flora in parts of California, Australia, Argentina and elsewhere.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>


<h2 id="arti" class=lrg>Globe Artichokes</h2>

<p>[<i>Cynara scolymus</i>] &nbsp; 
The edible artichoke is the flower bud of a thistle like plant native to 
the Mediterranean region, the buds being harvested when mature but not yet 
opened. It is not known if the Globe Artichoke existed in its current form 
during the classical Greek and Roman periods but it was definitely available 
by the 12th century. It may have been developed by selective breeding from the 
<a href="dy_thistle.html#card">Cardoon</a>, but that too is uncertain.</p>

<p>Essentially all fresh artichokes sold in the U.S. 
are grown in California, and the dominant Green Globe variety is grown almost 
entirely in the Salinas Valley on the central coast, production centering in 
Castroville and Moss Landing. This crop was originally planted by 
Italian families in the late 1800s and these families remain rather secretive 
about how to grow the Green Globe commercially.</p>

<img id=burn src="img/dy_artifrost01h.jpg" alt="Whole Frost Damaged Artichoke" class=mrg>
<h3>Frost Damage / Wind Burn:</h3> &nbsp; 
Artichokes hit by frost or wind will look a bit grungy. They may be sold 
at a lower price, or may be the only ones available at a certain time. 
Aside from appearance, they are generally undamaged - just pull of the 
tough outer leaves and trim the tips of the remaining leaves.<p></p>
<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Artichokes have an 
antioxidant load considered among the highest for vegetables. They also 
contain compounds that contribute to healthy digestion (increasing bile 
flow, improving liver function and supporting beneficial gut bacteria) as 
well as reducing blood cholesterol and improving the HDL/LDL ratio. 
Artichoke extracts have been found useful for treating functional dyspepsia 
and irritable bowel syndrome. The beneficial components are found mostly in 
the flesh coating the leaves rather than in the heart.

<h2 id="artv">Globe Artichokes - Varieties</h2>

<table class=top>

   <h3 id="green">Green Globe Artichoke</h3>
   <br><a href="dy_artiglbz.html">
   <img src="img/dy_acglobe16e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Green Globe" class=mrg></a>
   The dominant artichoke in California, the Green Globe is grown in Monterey 
   County on the central coast. The harvest begins in March and continues 
   well into May with a smaller harvest in September and October. Sizes range 
   from 18 count (jumbo) through 60 count, plus "large loose" (cocktail) and 
   "small loose" (baby) sizes. The "count" is for a 22 to 24 pound case.
   <p>The Green Globe is a perennial crop and fairly expensive to produce so 
   attempts to replace it with lower cost annual varieties growable in 
   other parts of California are being made - so far with less than fully 
   satisfactory results.
   &nbsp; <a href="dy_artiglbz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="baby">Baby Artichoke</h3>
   <br><img src="img/dy_artibb08e.jpg" alt="Whole, Split, Peeled Baby Artichokes" class=mrg>
   These are not "baby" at all but mature buds that grow lower on the 
   stalk after the big flower at the top has been cut. They are used 
   quite differently from the large artichokes. Most harvested in 
   California formerly went to marinated artichoke heart production but 
   that business has moved to Spain. "Babies" are consequently becoming 
   more common in the markets and people are learning how to cook them.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="heart">Artichoke Hearts</h3>
   <br><a href="dy_artihrtz.html">
   <img src="img/dy_artihrt02e.jpg" alt="Canned Artichoke Hearts" class=mrg></a>
   These are smaller Baby Artichokes, trimmed all the way down to just 
   the edible part, and sold either frozen or canned. Canned is how they 
   will be most easily found here in Southern California, and some report 
   the canned are better than the frozen. The two at the left are 
   "hearty" size and the rest are "baby" size. 
   <a href="dy_artihrtz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="thorn">Thornless Artichoke</h3>
   <br>[Imperial Star] &nbsp; This "seed" variety was developed by the 
   University of California (famous for durable but flavorless tomatoes) 
   as an annual that would be less expensive to grow than the perennial 
   <a href="dy_thistle.html#green">Green Globe</a>. It has met considerable consumer 
   resistance because it is neither as tasty nor nearly as meaty as the 
   Green Globe. Harvest is January through April and August through 
   October. Sizes range from 18 count (jumbo) through 60 count.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="globe">Desert Globe Artichoke</h3>
   <br>A proprietary semi-thornless "seed artichoke" developed to counter 
   consumer resistance to the <a href="dy_thistle.html#thorn">Thornless Artichoke</a> 
   but also grown as an annual crop. It has better flavor and more meat 
   than the Thornless but is still inferior to the 
   <a href="dy_thistle.html#green">Green Globe</a> on both counts. Most production is in 
   Southern California's Riverside and Ventura counties with harvest 
   running from January through March. Sizes range from 18 count (jumbo) 
   through 60 count, plus "large loose" (cocktail) and "small loose" 
   (baby) sizes.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="bheart">Big Heart Artichoke</h3>
   <br><img src="img/dy_acbigh01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Big Heart Artichoke" class=mrg>
   A thornless variety with a wide base that's meatier than the Imperial 
   Star thornless. Grown on the California Central Coast and in the 
   Imperial Valley just north of the Mexican border it is harvested in 
   all months except December, January and April. Sizes range from 8 
   count (huge) to 48 count. The leaves aren't as fleshy as those of the 
   green globe, but the heart is substantial and has good flavor. The 
   center of the stem can be scooped out with a spoon and eaten.  The 
   photo specimen was 4-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 3-1/4 
   ounces.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="lyon">Lyon Artichoke</h3>
   <br><img src="img/dy_artilyon03e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Lyon Artichoke" class=mrg>
   [Gros Vert de Laon]
   <p>
   These very spherical artichokes were developed in France, but are now 
   grown also in California. They are very large, weighing up to two 
   pounds each. They are usually shipped with substantial stem because 
   the core of the stem is edible. The heart is quite large.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Sangria Artichoke</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/dy_acsang02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Sangria Artichoke" class=mrg>
   This is a new patented variety released in 2013. The color results 
   from anthocyanin antioxidants. Aside from decorative color, I found 
   nothing outstanding about this artichoke. The larger was 3-3/4 
   inches diameter and weighed 10-7/8 ounces.   
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="euro">Euro Chokes</h3>
   <br><img src="img/dy_artieuro01e.jpg" alt="Eruo Choke Heads w/Stems" class=mrg>
   A trade name for perennial varieties recently developed in France. 
   These are now being grown in California and are shipped with stems as 
   long as 16 inches. The stems contain a lot more edible flesh and less 
   tough fiber than the typical California artichoke. &nbsp; <small>

<br><img src="img/dy_thisscot01h.jpg" alt="Scotch Thistle Flower" class=mrg>
[Cotton Thistle; <i>Onopordum acanthium</i>]
<p>
This plant is native from Iberia east to Kazakhstan and as far north as 
central Scandinavia. While today it is grown mainly as a decorative and 
for medicinal properties, in times past the receptacles (flower bases), 
which can get up to 2 inches across, were eaten similar to how artichokes 
are eaten today. They're rather small and difficult to handle, so aren't 
much eaten any more. The seeds were pressed for oil for both cooking 
and lighting.

<h2 id="thise">Edible Thistle</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_thisedul01h.jpg" alt="Edible Thistle Flower" class=mrg>
[<i>Cirsium edule</i>]
<p>
This plant grows from southeast Alaska though British Columbia, Canada, 
into Oregon, and there is an isolated population in Iowa. It grows to 
about 6 feet tall with flower heads about 1-1/2 inch across - too small 
to eat. American Indians ate young shoots and root tubers. The tubers 
contain inulin, an indigestible carbohydrate that gives some people 
digestive distress, but which others consider an important health food. 
Most people can handle it if they start out with just a little 
and build up. Inulin is also found in Chicory and other roots.

[Canadian Thistle, Lettuce From Hell Thistle, California Thistle, 
Corn Thistle, Cursed Thistle, Field Thistle, Green Thistle, Hard Thistle, 
Perennial Thistle, Prickly Thistle, Small-flowered Thistle, Way Thistle; 
<i>Cirsium arvense</i>]
<p>
This thistle is native to Europe and northern Asia, but is now considered 
a noxious weed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and 
Brazil. The leaves are edible but too spiny to prepare. The stems, however 
are not so difficult and can be cooked as a vegetable. The tubers are 
edible and nutritious, but contain inulin, an indigestible carbohydrate 
that gives some people digestive distress, but which others consider an 
important health food. Most people can handle it if they start 
out with just a little and build up. Inulin is also found in Chicory and 
other roots.

<p>[Dwarf Carline Thistle, Silver Thistle, Hunter's Bread; 
<i>Carlina acaulis</i>]
</p><p>
This is a rather odd thistle. It forms a rosette of regular prickly 
thistle leaves, but never sends up the typical tall stem. The flower just 
opens right out of the rosette on one of the two subspecies, and atop a 
very short stem on the other. This plant is native to alpine regions of 
central and southern Europe, preferring dryish pastures. Young flower head 
buds can be cooked and eaten like globe artichokes, which resulted in the 
common name "Hunter's Bread".

<h2>Cabbage Thistle</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_thiscab01h.jpg" alt="Cabbage Thistle Leaves &amp; Flowers" class=mrg>
[<i>Cirsium oleraceum</i>]
<p>
Native to Central and Eastern Europe and Asia, this thistle grows to 
about 5 feet high, usually with a single unbranched stem, and prefers 
moist lowlands. The flower heads are dense and the flowers light yellow 
or slightly pink. It is cultivated in India and Japan for edible young 
stems, cooked as a vegetable. I chose the watercolor rather than any of 
the available photographs because it better shows both leaf and flower 
head.

<h2>Syrian Thistle</h2>
<br><img src="img/dy_thissyri01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Syrian Thistle Plant" class=mrg>
[Agavanos (Crete); <i>Notobasis syriaca</i>]
<p>
This nasty looking semi-desert plant is native from  the Canary Islands 
in the Atlantic, along North Africa, through the Levant, and into the 
Middle East. It doesn't look very edible, but on the island of Crete, 
tender shoots are peeled and eaten raw. This plant grows to about 39 
inches high, so the shoots can be substantial.
