[<i>Theobroma cacao</i>]
<p>
Mexican chocolate is used primarily to make hot chocolat to drink, but 
is also used in various recipes including mole (sauces) and baked goods. 
Ingredients are typically: Sugar, Cacao Nibs, Soy Lechithin, Cinnamon 
Flavor. Some varieties may also include almonds or other nuts, vanilla 
or other flavorings. Cacao Nibs are cacao beans which have been cleaned 
and roasted, then lightly crushed so the thin shells can be removed.</p>
<p> This product is quite different in processing and characteristics 
from European chocolate. It is most familiar in California as Ibarra's 
hexagonal boxes of "pills", though other forms are sold. The major 
shippers are Ibarra of Guadalajara (very common in California) and 
Mayordomo of Oaxaca (rare here) but there are other smaller shippers.</p>
