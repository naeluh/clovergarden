<h1>Brazil Nut Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Brazil Nut family (<i>Lecythidaceae</i>) is a fairly sizeable 
family and of great importance in some tropical regions. Described here 
are the varieties I have found sufficient detail on, but there are 
surely a number of similar varieties producing edible fruit and seeds.

<h2>Brazil Nut</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_brazil01h.jpg" alt="Cut Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>]
<p>
The Brazil nut tree, found in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, is very large, 
growing to 160 feet tall and over 6-1/2 feet in diameter. The fruit may 
be from 4 to nearly 6 inches in diameter, and is very heavy, often 
weighing over 4 pounds. For this reason it is unwise to stand under a 
Brazil nut tree when the wind is blowing - getting hit by a 4 pound 
fruit falling more than 100 feet is not a pleasant experience, and may, 
in fact, be your last experience.</p>
<p>The Brazil nut tree fruits only in undisturbed forest, because it 
depends on certain smelly wild orchids growing nearby to attract a
particular variety of large bumble bee, the only insect strong enough 
to pry open the flowers and pollinate them.  A single hard shelled fruit 
may contain from 8 to 24 hard shelled "nuts" arranged like orange 
wedges. The fruit matures in about 14 months after pollination. In nature 
large squirrel-like rodents gnaw the pods open, eat some seeds and bury 
others for future use - and just like our squirrels, they forget where 
they hid them. Some of these sprout, but the sprouts may have to 
wait many years for a large tree to fall so they have enough sunlight 
to grow big.<br class=cll></p>

The Brazil nut has been much ballyhooed as a solution to rain forest 
clearing - people can just gather the very profitable fruits from the 
forest floor. Unfortunately this isn't working as a sustainable harvest. 
Too many fruits are being gathered in many areas, and there aren't 
enough young trees sprouting to sustain the forest.</p>
<p>Brazil nut seeds are very nutritious, 18% protein, 13% carbohydrates 
and 69% fats, with a large selection of vitamins and minerals. There are 
also some downsides. Brazil nut seeds contain unusually high levels of 
the anti-nutrient phytic acid, which suppresses uptake of some minerals, 
particularly iron. Like other fruits in this family, it tends to 
concentrate heavy metals, particularly selenium, and in this case 
radium, in very small amounts, but about 1000 times more than in most 
foods. The amount of selenium can be a health hazard if you overindulge, 
resulting in hair loss and other symptoms. Europe has banned import of 
Brazil nuts in the shell, as many shells have been found to be 
contaminated with aflatoxins - so don't eat the shells. These seeds 
are also a cause of allergic reactions in people with nut allergies, 
even though they are technically not nuts.

<h2>Anchovy Pear</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_anchpear01h.jpg" alt="Drawing of Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Grias cauliflora</i>]
<p>
Native to Jamaica and other islands of the Caribbean, this tree, often 
branchless, can grow to 50 feet tall, crowned with paddle shaped leaves 
up to 3 feet long. Flowers, 2 inches across, sprout directly from the 
trunk, as do the resulting fruit. The fruit, 2 to 3 inches long, looks 
much like a brown kiwi fruit, but more pear shaped, and has a single 
hard seed in the center. It is normally picked unripe, when it is quite 
sour from it's vitamin C content, and is most often sliced and pickled 
to be used as appetizers. The taste is similar to mango, which is 
similarly pickled when unripe.  This may have been developed by East 
Indians who were brought in to work the plantations after all the native 
Indians had been worked to death.

<h2>Paradise Nut</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_paradis02h.jpg" alt="Fruit Pod" class=mrg>
[Sapucaia; <i>Lecythis zabucajo</i>]
<p>
This large tree is native to Brazil, the Guianas, Suriname, Venezuela, 
Ecuador and Honduras in tropical South America, and has been successfully 
introduced to Trinidad. It's fruit pods are slightly flattened spheres 
and may measure up to nearly 7 inches across. The woody shell is up 
to 0.7 inches thick, and when the fruit is ripe, about a year after 
flowering, the lid blows off (see illustration at top of page), allowing 
access to the interior. Both the fruit arils (cream colored pulp) and the 
seeds are edible.  The seeds are reddish brown, roughly elliptical and up 
to 1-1/2 inches long. They may be eaten raw or cooked, but in moderation. 
They tend to absorb heavy metals, particularly selenium, in amounts that 
could be harmful to health.

<h2>Cream Nut</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_cream01e.jpg" alt="Fruit Pod sawed lengthwise" class=mrg>
[Monkey Pot; Sapucaia, Castanha-de-sapucaia (Brazil); <i>Lecythis 
pisonis</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Lecythis marcgraaviana</i> (nearly 
identical - former synonym)]
<p>
This tree is native to Brazil, the Guianas and Suriname in tropical 
Eastern South America.	 It's fruit pods are roughly spherical or 
ovoid, and may measure 3-1/2 inches to 11-1/2 across. The 
woody shell is up to 1-1/2 inches thick, and when the fruit is ripe, 
about a year after flowering, the lid blows off, allowing access to 
the interior. Both the fruit arils (cream colored pulp) and the seeds 
are edible. The seeds are reddish brown, roughly elliptical and up to 2 
inches long. They may be eaten raw or cooked, but in moderation. They 
tend to absorb heavy metals, particularly selenium, in amounts that 
could be harmful to health.
