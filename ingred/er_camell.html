<h1>Camellia / Tea Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The <i>Theaceae</i> are a modest size family of 12 genera, and only one 
of those genera, <i>Camellia</i>, is of significant culinary or 
economic importance - but that one is a real blockbuster. Aside from 
providing popular decorative shrubs and trees (photo is of decorative 
species <i>Camellia x williamsii</i> var Brigadoon), Camellias are 
the source of all the tea in China (and India) as well as providing 
cooking oil for parts of China and Japan.

<h2>Christmas Camellia</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_camell02h.jpg" alt="Red Christmas Camellia Flower" class=mrg>
[Yuletide Camellia; Sazanka (Japan); <i>Camellia sasanqua</i>]
<p>
Native to northern China and Japan, this Camellia was introduced 
to Europe in 1869, and soon taken to North America. In the West, it is 
primarily a decorative, but in Japan it was grown for practical purposes. 
The leaves were used to make tea, and in some parts of Japan it is still 
so used, but also the seeds were pressed to make Tea Seed Oil for 
cooking, lighting, lubrication and cosmetics.

<h2>Tea Oil Camellia</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_camello01k.jpg" alt="Tea Oil Camellia Flower and Leaves" class=mrg>
[Oil Seed Camellia; <i>Camellia oleifera</i>]
<p>
This large shrub or small tree (up to 20 feet tall) is in widespread 
cultivation in China, and from its seeds is pressed the dominant cooking 
oil of Hunan province and other southern regions. It is an excellent 
oil for all culinary uses, being at least 68% monounsaturated oil, with 
saturated oils higher than polyunsaturated oils - similar to olive oil. 
It is high in vitamin E and other antioxidants, and has a high smoke 
point, 485&deg;F/252&deg;C. <b>Caution:</b> this oil may be labeled 
"Tea Oil" but is better labeled "Tea Seed Oil" to clarify that it is not 
toxic "Tea Tree Oil" from the Paperback Melaleuca (<i>Melaleuca 
alternifolia</i>), used as a medicinal and as a minor component in some 
soaps. Tea seed oil is also used in soap manufacturing.

<h3>Tea Camellia</h3>
<br><img src="img/er_tea01h.jpg" alt="Leaves on Tea Camellia Shrub" class=mrg>
[<i>Camellia sinensis</i>]
<p>
This tree, native to East Asia and Southeast Asia can grow to over 50 
feet high, but for tea production it is kept pruned to less than 6 feet 
so the new leaves are accessible. There are two major varieties, 
<i>C. sinensis</i> var. <i>sinensis</i>, which predominates in most of 
China, and the larger leaved <i>C. sinensis</i> var. <i>assamica</i> 
(Assam Tea) which dominates in Assam and Darjeeling in India, and in 
the far south of China. The plant was acquired by the British, by means 
fair or foul, and planted in India to avoid paying the Chinese so much 
money for tea. It is now grown in subtropical and tropical regions 
around the world, but the two top producers, by far, are China and India.

</p>
<p>
<i>C. sinensis</i> is also used to produce Tea Seed Oil, but not to 
nearly the extent of <i>C. oleifera</i>. A number of different teas are 
made from this plant, depending on picking and processing. In general, 
the smaller the leaves when picked, the better the quality of the tea, 
and the higher the altitude where the plants are grown, the slower 
they develop, also resulting in better quality tea.</p>
<p>Tea is generally steeped for a short time in water no hotter than 
185&deg;F/85&deg;C for just a few minutes. The lower temperature and 
short steeping time prevent tannins from being extracted which would 
make the brew bitter. Tea leaves can hold up for 3 to 5 infusions 
depending on type and quality. This is not the case in Africa and the 
Near East where bitter tea is preferred, and loaded with sugar and other 
adulterants. This provides the tea growing regions a ready market for 
inferior grades of tea and dust from processing.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>White Tea:</h3> &nbsp; This tea is made from very young leaves 
  still covered with white hairs. The leaves are withered, then quickly 
  dried to prevent any further changes. The tea brewed from it is a 
  light yellow and thought to be very healthy, including anti-cancer 
  properties. </li>
<li><h3>Green Tea:</h3> &nbsp; This tea is made by a very brief process. 
  Leaves are wilted and immediately sun dried, roasted or steamed to 
  stop enzyme processes and oxidation, preserving the green color and 
  natural nutritional compounds.</li>
<li><h3>Yellow Tea:</h3> &nbsp; This tea is made by a process similar to 
  Green Tea, but dried more slowly so the leaves yellow. The taste is 
  somewhat different from either white or green tea.</li>
<li><h3>Oolong Tea:</h3> &nbsp; [wulong] This tea is first subjected to 
  withering under intense sun, then allowed to oxidize under the 
  influence of <i>Polyphenol oxidase</i>, an enzyme contained within the 
  leaves. The leaves are rolled up into cylinders or beads. Oolong teas 
  vary greatly by location, cultivar and processing. Oxidation may be 
  from 8% to 85%, greatly affecting flavor. This is a preferred tea of 
  conoisseurs in China.</li>
<li><h3>Black Tea:</h3> &nbsp; [Red Tea in China] This tea is first wilted, 
  then rolled and chopped by hand or mechanical methods. It is then 
  oxidized under controlled temperature and humidity until it is almost 
  completely oxidized under the influence of <i>Polyphenol oxidase</i>, 
  an enzyme contained within the leaves. It is then dried, graded by 
  size and packaged.</li> 
<li><h3>Fermented Tea:</h3> &nbsp; [Black Tea in China] After the oxidizing 
  process described above, this tea is actually microbially fermented in 
  a process similar to composting, mainly by <i>Aspergillus niger</i>. 
  If a controlled atmosphere is available fermentation can be much quicker 
  and more reliable than under primitive conditions. It is then 
  pressed into various shapes and aged, sometimes for many years, to 
  develop flavor, but experts say it should not be aged more than 100 
  years. Fermented teas are very popular in Tibet and Central Asia.</li>
<li><h3>Pu-erh Tea:</h3> &nbsp;  This is the best known of the fermented 
  teas. It is made in southern China, always from the larger leaf 
  var <i>assamica</i> which dominates in the south.</li>
<li><h3>Twig Tea:</h3> &nbsp; [Kukicha, B&ouml;cha] This tea is made from 
  twigs and stems, usually as green tea but sometimes with more 
  oxidation. It is steeped at 155&deg; to 180&deg;F (70&deg; to 80&deg;C)
  supporting three to four infusions; 40 / 14 / 30 seconds. It is 
  noted for a mildly nutty flavor and a very low caffeine level. It is 
  the favored tea of the Michio Kushi Macrobiotics folks.</li>
