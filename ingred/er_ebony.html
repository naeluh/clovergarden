<h1>Ebony Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Ebony</span> is a modest size family of tropical and subtropical 
trees (Ebenaceae) best known for hard wood of dark color, ranging 
all the way to jet black. The family includes two genera, <i>Euclea</i>, 
noted for hard dark wood, and <i>Diospyros</i>, noted for hard dark wood, 
but also for a few species producing edible fruit, most notably 
persimmons.</p>

<h2>Date Plum</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/eb_datep01e.jpg" alt="Date Plum Fruits on Tree" class=mrg>
[Caucasian Persimmon, Lilac Persimmon; Dios Pyros (Greek); 
<i>Diospyros lotus</i>]
<p>
Native to Western Asia and Southern Europe, this is the persimmon known 
to the ancient Greeks as "Fruit of the Gods". The English "Date Plum" 
is a direct translation of the Persian name Khormaloo. This persimmon is 
one of several items suspected of being the "Lotus" mentioned in the 
Odyssey, so delicious its eaters would forget to go home. It is pretty 
much unknown in the US where Asian and native persimmons dominate.	The 
fresh fruit is about 3/4 inch diameter and fairly tart, but after a frost 
or when dried it is quite sweet.

<h2>Jackalberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_jakberry01d.jpg" alt="Jackalberries on Tree" class=mrg>
[African Ebony; Jakkalsbessie (Afrikaans); <i>Diospyros mespiliformis</i>]
<p>
Native to the savannas of Africa, the fruit of this tree grows to a 
little over 1 inch in diameter and turns purple when ripe. It is much liked 
by jackals and is a traditional food of the Bantu people. Described as having 
a "lemon-like" flavor, jackalberries are often made into preserves. The wood 
is highly resistant to termite damage, as one would be expect of a tree that 
likes to grow on termite mounds.

<h2>Persimmon - American</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_persimam02e.jpg" alt="American Persimmon on Tree" class=mrg>
[Eastern Persimmon, Common Persimmon, <i>Diospyros virginiana</i>]
<p>
Native to the Southeastern US this persimmon is small. The photo specimens 
were up to 0.82 inches, but they can grow to about 1-1/2 inches diameter. 
These are highly astringent when unripe but becomes sweet and tasty when 
completely ripe. It is a very popular fruit and grown commercially in its 
native region. Aside from eaten fresh it is used to make a kind of 
molasses and fermented with hops and grain into a beer, which may be 
further processed into brandy. It is not much exported from the region 
and almost never appears here in California where Fuyus and Hachiya are 
grown in quantity. I have no memory of where I got the photo specimens 
back in 2009. The tree produces an excellent ebony wood, but not for 
about 100 years.

<h2>Persimmon - Fuyu</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_persimfuyu01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Fuyu Persimmons" class=mrg>
[Japanese Persimmon; Fuyugaki, Fuyu, Kaki (Japan); Sharon Fruit (Israel 
- Israel trade name); <i>Diospyros kaki</i> var <i>Fuyu</i>]
<p>
Native to China, this persimmon was taken to Japan long ago, and 
brought to Southern California early in the 20th century. Produce 
markets here now display these in big bins when in season (October through 
December). They are firm, durable and easy to market, and can be eaten in 
that state because they're a non-astringent variety.</p>
<p> They are pleasant enough to eat as sold, crunchy and mildly sweet. 
Unfortunately they'll never get a whole lot better (see Hachiya).  Choose 
fruit that is mostly yellow to orange with little green. They'll keep out 
on the counter for as much as a couple of weeks.

<h2>Persimmon - Goma</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_pgoma01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Goma Persimmons" class=mrg>
[Hyakume; <i>Diospyros kaki</i>]
<p>
This is a pollination-variant of non-astringent persimmons. When fully 
pollinated the fruit is brown inside rather than orange, and it can be 
eaten while still firm. Much prized in Japan, some are grown in California 
but are not commercially available - only direct from the growers and at 
farmer's markets in the growing area.

<h2>Persimmon - Hachiya</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_persimmon04e.jpg" alt="Fruit" class=mrg>
[Japanese Persimmon; Kaki (Japan); <i>Diospyros kaki</i> var 
<i>Hachiya</i>]
<p>
Native to China and carried to Japan long ago, this was formerly the 
most common persimmon in Southern California markets. The Hachiya has 
recently been overtaken by the less sweet and less flavorful Fuyu 
due to ripening and handling considerations. When not completely ripe the 
Hachiya is very astringent - it'll pucker your lips and twist your tongue - 
and the time between unripe and over-ripe is very short. On the other hand, 
eating a perfectly ripened Hachiya is an experience as sensuous as eating 
something else, except it tastes better. No Fuyu can compete with this.</p>
<p>Hachiyas are in season from October into December. When selecting fruit 
choose those that are even in appearance and without bruises or soft spots. 
You will rarely find one perfectly ripe in the market but select for just a 
hint of give - not too hard. Set on the counter and check every day until 
they yield easily to light pressure but do not feel mushy. Enjoy.</p>
<p>In Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam and in small amounts in California, this 
type of persimmon is dried using a traditional process. In Korea it is 
fermented and made into a persimmon vinegar. In Taiwan astringent varieties 
that aren't quite ripe are pickled in lime water to get rid of the astringency 
and sold as "crisp persimmons".

<h2 id="sapon">Sapote Negro</h2>
<br><img src="img/eb_sapoten01d.jpg" alt="Cut fruit" class=mrg>
[Black Sapote, Black Persimmon, Chocolate pudding fruit; Zapote prieto 
(Spanish); <i>Diospyros digyna</i>]
<p>
Native to eastern Mexico and Central America as far south as 
Colombia, this tree is completely unrelated to the Sapote Blanko (White 
Sapote) or the Mammey Sapote. The fruit pulp is often served mixed with 
orange juice and honey and likened to a chocolate pudding.
