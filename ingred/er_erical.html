<h1>Ericales / Heath - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<i>Ericales</i> is a large order, containing more than 8000 species in 
around 30 families. There are several significant culinary families, each 
of which has its own page on this site. While those family pages will 
usually be accessed directly, this page serves to organize them and show 
the diversity of the order. Surprisingly, I did not find any culinary 
species that did not belong to a significant family. The photo is of 
Common Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), the most common heather in 
Europe. It is not strictly a culinary variety, but traditionally used 
to make brooms to sweep the kitchen floor.

<h2 id="brazil">Brazil Nut Family</h2>
<br><a href="er_brazil.html">
<img src="img/er_brazil05c.jpg" alt="Brazil Nuts, whole and shelled" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Lecythidaceae</i>]
<p>
The Brazil Nut family (<i>Lecythidaceae</i>) is a fairly sizeable 
family and of great importance in some tropical regions. Described here 
are the varieties I have found sufficient detail on, but there are 
surely a number of similar varieties producing edible fruit and seeds.
The <a href="er_brazil.html"><b>Brazil Nut Family</b></a> has its own 
page.

<h2 id="heath">Heather Family</h2>
<br><a href="er_heath.html">
<img src="img/er_cran11c.jpg" alt="Cranberries, whole, dried, and cut" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Ericaceae</i>]<p>
The Heather Family (<i>Ericaceae</i>) is a very large family, 
containing over 4000 species in 126 genera. It includes a great many 
flowering plants used as decoratives and landscaping, but also a few 
culinary species, most notably blueberries and cranberries.
The <a href="er_heath.html"><b>Heather Family</b></a> has its own 
page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="ebony">Ebony Family</h2>
<br><a href="er_ebony.html">
<img src="img/eb_persimmon04c.jpg" alt="Persimmons, whole and cut" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Ebenaceae</i>]
<p>
Ebony is a modest size family of tropical and subtropical trees 
(Ebenaceae) best known for hard wood of dark color, ranging all the way 
to jet black. The family includes two genera, <i>Euclea</i>, noted for 
hard dark wood, and <i>Diospyros</i>, noted for hard dark wood, but 
also for a few species producing edible fruit, most notably persimmons.
The <a href="er_ebony.html"><b>Ebony Family</b></a> has its own page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sapo">Sapote Family</h2>
<br><a href="so_sapote.html">
<img src="img/so_mamey06c.jpg" alt="Mamey Spote Fruit, whole and cut" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Sapotaceae</i>]
<p>
Sapotes have long been important trees in the tropical Americas, Africa 
and Southeast Asia. They have provided sap of industrial importance, 
fruit, and wood - hard to extremely hard wood. They range from small to 
rather large trees. The <a href="so_sapote.html"><b>Sapote Family</b></a> 
has its own page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="kiwi">Kiwi / Chinese Gooseberry Family</h2>
<br><a href="er_kiwi.html">
<img src="img/od_kiwi07c.jpg" alt="Whole Kiwi Fruit" class=mrg></a>
<p>[<i>Actinidiaceae</i>]
</p><p>
This modest size family of 3 genera and some 360 species of vines shrubs 
and trees native to temperate and subtropical environments has only a 
few members of culinary and commercial interest, the Kiwi Fruit. There 
are also varieties of interest to cats.
The <a href="er_kiwi.html"><b>Kiwi Family</b></a> 
has its own page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="tea">Camellia / Tea Family</h2> 
<br> <a href="er_camell.html">
<img src="img/er_camell02c.jpg" alt="Red Flower" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Theaceae</i>]
<p>
Camellias are well known as decorative flowering shrubs and trees, but 
they are also of tremendous economic value, particularly to China and 
India, for both tea and cooking oil. Worldwide, tea is the second most 
consumed beverage, second only to water.
