<h1>Heather Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Heather Family (<i>Ericaceae</i>) is a very large family, 
containing over 4000 species in 126 genera. It includes a great many 
flowering plants used as decoratives and landscaping, but also a few 
popular culinary species. We present here the most popular and 
important, listed by genus, but each genus also includes a few or a 
whole lot of related plants that are of local culinary use.</p> 
<p>The photo is of Common Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), the most 
common heather in Europe and the type specimen for the family. It is not 
strictly a culinary variety, but traditionally used to make brooms to 
sweep the kitchen floor, and leaves were once used to flavor beer, 
before hops took over.

<h2>Bilberries</h2>
<br>[genus <i>Vaccinium</i>] &nbsp; This genus of plants is found mostly 
in the Northern Hemisphere, though a few species are native to South 
America and some have been introduced to New Zealand and possibly 
Australia. Those listed here are the ones of greatest culinary interest 
and/or commercial importance. There are many other species closely 
related to each of those listed which are used locally. Naming is quite 
confusing as the names Blueberry, Huckleberry, Whortleberry and Bilberry 
are used interchangeably in different regions. In commercial production, 
the United States produces nearly 80% of the world's supply of berries 
in this genus, with Canada second at about 15%<p></p>

   deliciosum</i>]
   <p>
   These berries are native to Europe, northern Asia, Greenland, Western 
   Canada, and the Western United States. They are almost identical in 
   appearance to the American Blueberry, but have deep red flesh rather 
   than nearly colorless, are more fragrant and more tart. They are used 
   similarly to Blueberries, but are usually gathered wild rather than 
   grown commercially. Both berries and leaves are used medicinally.

   [Northern Highbush Blueberry; <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> and about 
   18 other species plus hybrids]
   <p>
   Blueberries are native to North America. The Highbush Blueberry which 
   accounts for most commercial production, is native from the Great Lakes 
   region to Nova Scotia, Canada, and in the Northeast United States 
   throughout the Appalachian region and as far south as Mississippi. It 
   has been naturalized in British Columbia, Canada and Washington State 
   in the west, and as far afield as Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand and 
   Netherlands. The photo specimens were up to 0.8 inches diameter.

   This shrub, which can be ground hugging or up to nearly 10 feet high,
   is native to the northern Andes mountains in Bolivia, Colombia, 
   Ecuador and into Venezuela. The photo was taken in Costa Rica, which 
   also has mountains sufficiently high. The morti&ntilde;o grows at 
   elevations of 5,900 to 12,500 feet and produces edible bluish black 
   berries that are eaten raw or made into preserves. It is often used 
   with other fruits in a dish made for the "Day of the Dead" celebration.

   <i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Common Cranberry, 
   Northern Cranberry <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp;  
   Small Cranberry; <i>Vaccinium microcarpum</i>]
   <p>
   These berries have been very important to natives of the circumpolar 
   regions of the world both as food and medicine. They thrive mainly in 
   bogs and other areas with damp acidic soil. The berries are 
   particularly high in vitamin C and manganese. The photo specimens are 
   dried and fresh American Cranberries, with the fresh about 0.9 inch 
   long and 0.68 inch across, weighing about 15 to the ounce, while the 
   dried weigh about 52 to the ounce.</p>

   <p>The American Cranberry produces the very tart dark red berries 
   familiar to Americans. It is native to North America from Wisconsin 
   northeast to Newfoundland and as far south as North Carolina. The 
   Common Cranberry is a circumpolar native ranging from North Carolina 
   to a little above the Arctic Circle. It produces pink berries with 
   less harsh acidity than the American Cranberry, and is used throughout 
   its range. The Small Cranberry ranges from Iceland across Siberia, a 
   bit farther above the Arctic Circle, but not nearly as far south as 
   the Common Cranberry, and is not found in North America.

   [<i>Vaccinium parvifolium</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native from southeastern Alaska down to Central 
   California, and was an important food item for American Indians in 
   the region. The tart, red-orange berries, ranging from 0.24 inch to 
   0.39 inch diameter, are eaten fresh or dried. The dried are used in 
   sauces and teas, and the fresh are often made into jellies.

   [Cowberry, Partridgeberry, Redberry, Foxberry. <i>Vaccinium 
   vitis-idaea</i>]
   <p>
   These small red berries are native to the subarctic forest and tundra 
   around the world, from the US-Canadian border to the arctic circle and 
   in Eurasia through Scandinavia and Siberia to the Pacific and south 
   through Poland. In Eurasia and Canada they are usually picked wild, 
   and are particularly popular in Scandinavia. Some are being farmed in 
   the US Pacific Northwest.  The bright red berries range from 0.2 to 
   0.4 inches diameter and are quite tart, similar to the cranberries 
   to which they are related. They are usually cooked and sweetened, or 
   simply crushed and mixed with sugar. Sauces and jams made from them  
   are popular with meats and spread on toast. The photo specimens, 
   from Lithuania, were purchased frozen from a large multi-ethnic 
   market in Los Angeles (Sunland).

<h2>Wintergreens</h2>
<br>[genus <i>Gaultheria</i>] &nbsp; This genus of plants, about 175 
species in all, is native to Asia, North and South America, and 
Australasia. Most produce edible berries, but most of these are insipid 
and not much eaten by humans. A few do have culinary uses, and many 
have medicinal uses.<p></p>

   [Eastern Teaberry, Checkerberry, Boxberry, American Wintergreen; 
   <i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>]
   <p>
   This small, low growing shrub is native to northeastern North America, 
   from Newfoundland, Canada, west to southeastern Manitoba, Canada, and 
   south to Alabama in the United States.  It bears small red berries 
   0.24 inch to 0.35 inch diameter, which are edible and have a minty 
   flavor.</p>
   <p>The leaves are used as tea and for medicinal purposes. They must 
   be fermented for 3 days to develop the oil of wintergreen through 
   enzymic action before drying or processing. Wintergreen is a flavoring 
   used in both medicinal and non-medicinal products. An ounce of oil 
   of wintergreen contains as much salicylate as 171 adult aspirins, 
   indicating caution in its use is very important.

   <br><img src="img/er_salal01h.jpg" alt="Salal Berries on Branch" class=mrg>
   [Shallon, Gaultheria; <i>Gaultheria shallon</i>]
   <p>
   This large shrub is native to North America, particularly 
   the Western Coastal Ranges from the Alaskan Panhandle to Santa 
   Barbara county north of Los Angeles. It bears small reddish to 
   blue berries 0.24 inch to 0.39 inch diameter, which are edible with 
   a unique sweet taste. Young leaves are also edible, have a unique 
   taste, and both berries and leaves are effective appetite 
   suppressants.</p>
   <p>The native peoples in the region used the berries as food, both 
   fresh and dried, and the leaves as flavorings. A major use for the 
   berries was to mix with <a href="bc_butrcup.html#oregg">Oregon 
   Grape</a> to moderate its tartness. The leaves were sometimes used 
   to flavor fish soup.  Today, the berries are used to make preserves 
   and pie fillings.

   Native to wet forests and sub-alpine heath of Tasmania, Australia, 
   this shrub bears small, sour white to pink berries 0.31 inch to 0.39 
   inch diameter. The berries were eaten as "bush food" by the 
   aborigines, and were adopted by European colonists as filling for 
   tarts.

<h2>Black Crowberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_crowb01h.jpg" alt="Black Crowberries on Branch" class=mrg>
[Blackberry (Labrador); <i>Empetrum nigrum</i>]
<p>
Berries of this subarctic circumpolar low shrub have been a very important 
food for the Inuit, Sami and other peoples of the far north. They are very 
high in anthocyanin flavonoids, coloring the berries black or slightly 
reddish depending on soil pH. These berries were often mixed with other 
subarctic berries, particularly blueberries. The Dena'ina people of 
south central Alaska like them mixed with fats or oils. The leaves, stems 
and roots have been important medicinal components for the same peoples.
In Labrador, the stems and leaves are used for smoking fish.

<h2>Manzanita</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_manzan02h.jpg" alt="Manzanita Berries on Branch" class=mrg>
[Common Manzanita, Whiteleaf Manzanita <i>Arctostaphylos manzanita</i> 
 - and about 105 other Manzanita species]
<p>
Common Manzanita can get to almost 30 feet high under ideal conditions, 
but 15 feet is much more common. Most manzanitas are much smaller, but 
all are easily identifiable by their red to reddish-brown colored bark 
and tangled growth habit. Of the 106 or so species, 95 live in 
California. The Common Manzanita is most common in coastal mountains of 
Northern California, but is found from Washington State all the way down 
to the Mexican border. Other manzanitas are found 
from southwestern Canada down into Mexico.</p>
<p>The fruits are generally less than 1 inch diameter and ripen to 
reddish or deep red. They are not much used for food these days, but in 
the past native people ground the dried fruit into powder for use as 
a flavoring in soup, and the fruit of a number of species were crushed 
and soaked in water to make a kind of cider. Fruits of the Common 
Manzanita are edible and reasonably sweet, but eating many of them will 
result in gastric distress.

<h2>Bearberry</h2>

[Kinnikinnick, Radiant Manzanita, Pinemat Manzanita, Sandberry; 
<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>]
<p>
The Bearberry is actually a Manzanita (see above), but differs from 
other manzanitas in that it isn't confined to the temperate western 
coastal mountain region of North America. Subspecies <i>uva-ursi</i> 
(Common Bearberry) is a circumpolar species, extending from the Arctic 
Circle down to Central California and even New Mexico, as well as Spain, 
Italy, Turkey, Armenia and the Himalayas - but, the farther south, the 
higher the altitude it retreats to. There is one sub-species 
(<i>cratericola</i>) that lives in Guatemala at very high altitudes. 
This shrub forms large growths, but is rarely more than 6 inches high. 
It is considered a good ground cover plant for coastal California.</p>
<p>The fruits, 1/4 to 1/2 inch diameter, are edible. Raw they have a 
bitter-sweet flavor, but are sweeter cooked. They are generally 
considered mealy and insipid by humans, but other animals and birds have 
much more favorable opinions of them. Various parts of the plant have been 
used as medicinals, and the leaves were smoked in place of tobacco by 
Native Americans and European Settlers, often mixed with other leaves 
and/or tobacco
