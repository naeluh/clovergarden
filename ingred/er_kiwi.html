<h1>Kiwi / Chinese Gooseberry Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The <i>Actinidia</i> are a modest size family of 3 genera and some 
360 species of vines shrubs and trees native to temperate and subtropical 
environments. Genus <i>Saurauia</i>, with the most species, is native to 
East Asia and Central America, but information is scant and I've not 
yet found evidence of edibility. Genus <i>Clematoclethra</i> is native 
to western China, containing about 20 species, but I've found even 
less information or evidence of edibility. Genus <i>Actinidia</i>, 
woody vines native to temperate regions of East Asia, provides a number 
of edible and commercially viable berries, specifically Kiwi Fruit.

<h2>Kiwi Fruit</h2> 
<img src="img/od_kiwi07h.jpg" alt="Standard size Kiwis and Kiwi Berries" class=mrg>
[Chinese Gooseberry, Yangtao, <i>Actinidia deliciosa</i> (standard Kiwi) 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Actinidia arguta</i> (Kiwi Berry, Hardy Kiwi, 
Baby Kiwi) &nbsp;| &nbsp; <i>Actinidia chinensis</i> (Golden Kiwi)]
<p>
Native to northern China, this berry was taken to California in 
1904 and New Zealand in 1906. It was originally known as the "Chinese 
Gooseberry" because of a supposed similarity of flavor to the unrelated 
Gooseberry. The name "Kiwi" was selected as a marketing name when New 
Zealand growers started promoting the product ("Chinese" was considered 
not good during the Cold War).</p>

<p>Kiwi has soft green flesh with a taste that has been described as a mix 
of strawberry, banana, and pineapple. The seeds are edible and always 
eaten, but fussy people peel the fuzzy skin. I never bothered - and got 
the advantage of the skin's high antioxidant content as a bonus.</p>

<p>These fruits became scarce in 2010 to 2012 because a bacterial 
infection (<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i>) devastated 
crops worldwide in 2010 and 2011.  Italy, the leading producer, and 
New Zealand, second, accounted for 75% of world production and both 
were hit hard. The crop has recovered, but today (2017) China is 
the largest producer, producing as many tons as Italy and New Zealand 
combined, with Chile coming in fourth.</p>

<p><i>A. deliciosa</i> has been the most common species in the North 
America, with the tiny <i>A. arguta</i> gaining a market here as 
growers cranked up production (yuppies will pay more for "baby" anything). 
The yellow fleshed <i>A. chinensis</i> has never been much available 
here. The future of these crops is now in doubt. Shown in the photo at 
the top of the page are: (A) A. arguta, (C) A. chinensis, 
(D) A. deliciosa, (E) A. eriantha, (P) A. polygama.

<h2>Silver Vine</h2>
<br><img src="img/er_kiwisv02k.jpg" alt="Silver Vine Fruit on Branch" class=mrg>
[Cat Pwder; Matatabi (Japan); <i>Actinidia polygama</i>]
<p>
Native to mountainous regions of China and Japan, this plant gets its 
name from its leaves being partially white, except during flowering when 
they turn entirely green.</p>

<p>this vine produces edible Kiwi Fruit (P in photo at top of page) but 
is more well known for driving cats bananas - it's stronger than Catnip. 
The active part is ground up fruit galls produced from infection with 
midges. Fruit without galls is pretty much ignored, as are other parts 
of the plant.</p>

<p>The fruit of this plant is typically around 1-1/2 inches long. It 
is often eaten raw with salt, but can be fried, added to rice, mixed 
into salad dressing, or made into fruit wine. Leaves, buds and stems 
are ground up to make an herbal tea (for people, not cats), and 
ground more coarsely for use as bath herbs.
