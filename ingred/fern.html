<h1>Ferns</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>Ferns (Division <i>Pteridophyta</i>) first appeared about 350 million 
years ago in the late Devonian, about the same time amphibians were 
learning to live on land. While relatively primitive compared to flowering 
plants and reproducing by spores rather than seeds, they have been, and 
still are, very successful. They are particularly common in some marginal 
environments where they may be the dominant flora, and may even become 
major pests.</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General &amp; History</h2>

<p>While Ferns have been with us forever and are common in many areas, 
they have played only a very minor role as food for humans or livestock. 
This is particularly due to toxicity, the fern's first line of defense 
against being eaten. The varieties identified as "edible" are still 
toxic, but in the small amounts we are likely to eat them they don't 
pose significant risk to most individuals.</p>
<p>While many ferns are prized as decoratives, some are major pests, 
particularly the Old World Climbing Fern (<i>Lygodium microphyllum</i>) 
which is currently strangling large areas of the Everglades in Florida, 
and the aquatic fern Giant Salvinia (<i>Salvinia molesta</i>) which is 
covering entire lakes in Hawaii and elsewhere. We cannot be too bitter 
about aquatic ferns though, since they may have been instrumental 
in reversing a previous global warming episode - by covering all the 
lakes formed by melting ice caps and absorbing carbon dioxide. They 
could come in handy again for that. Also, extracts of 
<i>Salvinia molesta</i> may be effective against cancers - currently 
under study.</p> 


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="brack">Bracken Fern</h2>
<br><a href="fn_fernbrz.html">
<img src="img/fn_bracken03d.jpg" alt="Immature Fern Fronds, dried, brined" class=mrg></a>
[Brake Fern, Fernbrake; Gosari (Korea); Warabi (Japan); 
<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>]
<p>
A common fern in temperate climates, immature Bracken fronds are 
eaten as a vegetable in many parts of the world and particularly in Korea, 
Japan and parts of China. Native Americans dug up, cooked and ate the 
rhizomes from which the fronds sprout. These are still used in Japan, 
Sichuan, China and elsewhere as a starch source (see noodles, below).
&nbsp; <a href="fn_fernbrz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>

<p>Bracken Fern is toxic to livestock when a significant part of their 
diet. For humans fresh fern should be cooked (simmered 10 minutes) and 
eaten in moderation. One of the toxins is a thiamine inhibitor that can 
cause a vitamin deficiency if consumed for an extended period. Bracken 
also contains a substance identified as a carcinogen and has been placed 
in the same risk category as Coffee and Sassafras by the American Cancer 
Society. Study is ongoing but still inconclusive, but demographics do not 
indicate a notable danger. 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/pa_334fern2d.jpg" alt="Noodle made from Fern Starch" class=mrg>
We found these noodles, made from starch extracted from bracken fern 
root, in one of the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. The strands 
were 0.063 inch diameter and 20 inches long, folded in the middle. Cooked, 
they resemble large, dark colored bean starch noodles, but have a lightly 
earthy flavor, while been starch noodles are pretty neutral. These come 
from Sichuan China, ingredients: fern root starch, rapeseed oil.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Ostrich Fern</h2>
<br><img src="img/fn_ostrich1c.jpg" alt="Ostrich Fern Fiddleheads" class=mrg>
<p>
This fern, common in the northern U.S and Canada and northern and eastern 
Europe provides the "fiddleheads" sold in commerce. They have a flavor 
somewhat similar to asparagus and are a little crunchy if not over cooked. 
They are popular in season (Spring) where the ferns grow, but are just a 
curiosity in here in Southern California, at more than U.S. $10 per 
pound from yuppie outlets like Whole Foods Markets.</p>
<p>Ostrich Fern is considered safe, or about as safe as ferns get. Some 
people have shown sensitivity to unidentified toxins in them, but most 
reported incidents of toxicity are from mistaking some other fern for 
Ostrich Fern. Simmering Ostrich fiddleheads for 10 minutes is said to 
make them safe for people sensitive to them. Ostrich Ferns are reported 
to be free of the carcinogens and thiamine inhibitors of the 
<a href="fern.html#brack">Bracken Fern</a>.</p>
<p><b>Buying, Storing &amp; Cooking</b> &nbsp; Fiddleheads should be 1 
to 1-1/2 inches diameter with no more than 2 inches of stem projecting 
from them. They should be crisp, not limp. Refrigerated they will keep 
up to 10 days but lose flavor rapidly. Rub off the brown chaff and trim 
the end of the stem before cooking.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Royal Fern</h2>
<br><img src="img/fn_royal01d.jpg" alt="Boiled Fern Fronds" class=mrg>
[Flowering Fern; Zenmai Mizuni; <i>Osmunda regalis</i>]
<p>
This is one of the largest ferns in Europe, with a range extending 
through East Asia to Korea and Japan. There is a closely related North 
American species, <i>O. spectabilis</i>. While the photo specimens were 
packed in China, the only place you are likely to find them in North 
America is in Korean markets, as they are a popular vegetable in Korea. 
They are generally vacuum packed in water after being boiled and may be 
labeled "Boiled Royal Fern" or "Osmund". The largest stem in the photo 
are about 3/8 inch diameter, but most are 1/4 inch or less. 
<br class=cll><p>



<h2>Other Ferns</h2>
<br>Other than the ferns identified here as edible, all others should be 
considered toxic (the edible ones are already toxic enough). In particular 
Cinnamon Fern and Interrupted Fern are often mistaken for Ostrich Fern 
resulting in illness. Lady Fern is said to be edible cooked but rather 
bitter compared to Ostrich Fern.<p></p>
