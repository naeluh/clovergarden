<h1>Bracken Fern</h1>
<br><img src="img/fn_bracken03g.jpg" alt="Dried and Boiled Ferns" class=mrg>
[Brake Fern, Fernbrake; Gosari (Korea); Warabi (Japan); 
  <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>]
<p>
A common fern in temperate climates, immature Bracken fronds are 
eaten as a vegetable in many parts of the world and particularly in Korea, 
Japan and parts of China. Native Americans dug up, cooked and ate the 
rhizomes from which the fronds sprout. These are still used in Japan, 
Sichuan, China and elsewhere, as a starch source (see noodles, below).</p>

<p>Bracken Fern is toxic to livestock when a significant part of their 
diet. For humans, fresh fern should be cooked (simmered 10 minutes) and 
eaten in moderation. One of the toxins is a thiamine inhibitor that can 
cause a vitamin deficiency if consumed for an extended period.</p>

<p>Bracken also contains a substance identified as a carcinogen 
(ptalquiloside), and has been placed in the same risk category as 
Coffee and Sassafras by the American Cancer Society. Study is ongoing, 
and there appears to be some cancer correlation for Korean and Japanese 
populations who eat fernbrake on practically a daily basis. 
Ptalquiloside is volatile and destroyed by heat. Currently there is 
insufficient data as to how much may remain in fresh boiled fernbrake, 
or dried, boiled, soaked and cooked fernbrake. Basically, cooked 
fernbrake seems safe enough for occasional use. Some varieties of 
fernbrake, particularly in New Zealand, do not contain this substance.

<p>The photo specimens are water packed and dried examples from a local 
Korean market. The dried is most used in Korea, because young fernbreak 
fronds are seasonal.</p>

<h3>Water Packed</h3> &nbsp; These were up to 11-1/2 inches long and the 
largest stems were just under 0.25 inch diameter. I have found it best to 
trim fronds to 9 inches because beyond that they are likely to be hard 
and fibrous.<p></p>
<h3>Dry Fernbrake:</h3> &nbsp; These were purchased from a Korean market 
in Los Angeles in a 6 ounce plastic bag, at 2015 US $3.99 for 6 ounces 
($10.64 / pound). They take boiling and a long soak (see below), but 
provide an interesting flavor.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Dried fernbrake, boiled and soaked by the method 
given below: one ounce dried produces 6.1 ounces rehydrated. The 
fernbrake is reasonably tender after the boil and cool, but the yield is 
5.4 ounces per ounce, so it clearly can still benefit from the 8 hour 
soak.<p></p>

<p>Korean cooking maven Maangchi recommends this procedure: 
<ol>
<li>Put the <b>Dried Ferns</b> in a pot with plenty of water to cover 
  and bring to a boil for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Set the pot aside, covered, and let cool for about for 2 or 3 hours.
  </li>
<li>Drain <b>Ferns</b>, place in a bowl and cover with cold water. Let 
  soak 8 hours or overnight, changing the water 2 or 3 times.</li>
<li>If the fernbrake is still not soft, boil for another 30 minutes and 
  let it sit until soft.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fern Root Noodles</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_334fern2g.jpg" alt="Black Noodles" class=mrg>

We found these noodles, made from starch extracted from bracken fern 
root, in one of the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. The strands 
were 0.063 inch diameter and 20 inches long, folded in the middle. Cooked, 
they resemble large, dark colored bean starch noodles, but have a lightly 
earthy flavor, while bean starch noodles are pretty neutral. These come 
from Sichuan China, ingredients: fern root starch, rapeseed oil.
