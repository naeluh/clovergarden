<h2>Black Fungus - Regular</h2>
<p>
This thin nearly black fungus is sold dried and will expand to about 4 
times the dried volume and about 5 times the weight when soaked. It is often 
used in soups and stir fries in China and Korea for its slippery but crunchy 
texture. It has little flavor of its own but does absorb flavors from other 
ingredients it's cooked with. In the photo there are three dried ones on the 
left, each a little over and inch across, and on the right a rehydrated one 
that was originally the same size as <u>one</u> of the others. Some are 
blacker after soaking.</p>
<p>It is held in Chinese medicine to improve blood circulation and relieve 
atherosclerosis. Preliminary tests in Western medicine are encouraging and 
include confirmation of anticoagulant properties.

<h2>Black Fungus - Fresh</h2> 

<p>Fresh is now often available in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles. 
It is grown in China and package on foam trays and shrink wrapped in 
California. It is shiny on the concave side and matte on the convex 
side. The photo specimens to the left were purchased at a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $6.11 / pound, labeled 
"Wood Ear".<p></p>

<h2>Giant Black Fungus</h2>
<p>This variety is now the one carried by 
the Korean Markets here in Los Angeles (2021). It is much larger than the 
regular ones and tan on the bottom side. Cooked it is black on both sides. 
Soaked, it is more leathery than the regular, and needs to be cut rather than 
torn apart. It remains a little leathery after cooking but has the crunch 
expected of Black Fungus. </p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Black Fungus can be found in just about 
any East or Southeast Asian market packed in plastic bags. As of early 
2021, I have seen the giant version only in Korean markets.

<p>Technically, "cloud ear" and "wood ear" are supposed to be different 
sizes / varieties, but that and any other distinctions are pretty much 
lost in commercial products. Most available in California is just called 
"Black Fungus".</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In a sealed container away from moisture, heat 
and sunlight, dried Black Fungus will last for years. Fresh, refrigerated 
on their original plastic film wrapped tray, will start to mold in about 
5 days.<p></p>

<h3>Preparation:</h3> &nbsp; Place dried fungus in a heat proof bowl and 
pour over enough hot water to cover after expansion (they will expand a 
lot). Let soak for 30 minutes or more, then rinse. Remove any woody 
anchor points and tear to sizes that match other ingredients. Fresh 
Black Fungus needs no more than a rinse.<p></p>
