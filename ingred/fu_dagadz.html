<p>This lichen is considered essential for making Goda Masala, a curry 
powder used in the Marathi cuisine of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. Its 
earthy flavor is considered very important to the cuisine of that region, 
but it is used to some extent in other regions, particularly Chettinad 
(in Tamil Nadu) and Hyderabad (in Telangana). The photo specimen is from 
India.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This lichen, dried, is available for purchase on 
the Internet. Some report having found it in Indian markets, but I haven't 
seen it in Artesia yet.  The price is rather high. The photo purchase 
cost 2021 US $7 (plus shipping) for 50 grams. (1-3/4 ounces). It is 
very light for its volume, so that 50 grams was 3 cups lightly packed. 
&nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; The name "Dagad Phool" means "stone flower" 
and is also used for star anise in parts of India. Be careful what you 
are buying.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In a sealed jar, it will keep for a year or so, 
but slowly fades in flavor.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  In general, these lichens are ground fairly fine, 
often after dry pan roasting until aromatic, as are most other spices for 
masalas.
