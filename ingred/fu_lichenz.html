<h1>Lichens</h1>
<p>
Lichens are  symbiotic composite organisms consisting of a fungus body 
within which live either single cell algae or cyanobacteria. This 
relationship, playing on the strengths of each, allows the  organism to 
live in extremely harsh environments, from arctic tundra to dry deserts 
and on bare rock, though they are also abundant in temperate and 
rainforest environments. Lichens are used as food by many cultures 
around the world, sometimes as a survival essential and sometimes as a 
delicacy.</p>

<h2>Iceland Moss</h2> 
<br><img src="img/fu_iceland01f.jpg" alt="Live Iceland Moss Lichens" class=mrg>
[<i>Cetraria islandica</i> of family <i>Parmeliaceae</i>]
<p>
Not actually a moss, and not confined to Iceland, though it is 
particularly lush there. It grows in Arctic and sub-Arctic environments 
all around the northern hemisphere, and much farther south in alpine 
regions. For a lichen, it has an unusually erect growth habit. It is 
eaten by various northern peoples, and it is also used medicinally. 
The photo specimen is from central Sweden. &nbsp;

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This lichen, dried, is available for purchase 
on the Internet - but it isn't cheap.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This lichen was included in bread and 
used in porridges, puddings, soups, and salads. Dried lichen can be 
used as a substitute for other starches. It is not much used today 
except medicinally.

<h2>Dagad Phool</h2>

[Black Stone Flower; Dagad Phool (Marathi); Kalpasi, Kallupachi, Phathar 
Ka Phool (Tamil); Riham karmani (Urdu); Kalahu (Kannada); Shaileyam (Sanskrit); 
Dagar da Phool (Punjabi); Patthar ke phool (Hindi); Bojhwar, Chadila, 
(northern India); <i>Parmelia perlata</i> of family <i>Parmeliaceae</i>]

<p>This lichen is considered essential for making Goda Masala, a curry 
powder used in the Marathi cuisine of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. Its 
earthy flavor is considered very important to the cuisine of that region, 
but it is used to some extent in other regions, particularly Chettinad 
(in Tamil Nadu) and Hyderabad (in Telangana). The photo specimen is from 
India.

<h2>Reindeer Moss</h2>

[Caribou moss, Reindeer lichen; <i>Cladonia rangiferina</i> - also - 
<i>Cladonia portentosa</i> of family <i>Cladoniaceae</i>]
<p>
These slow growing lichens are found in Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine 
regions all around the northern hemisphere, and are extremely cold 
tolerant. They are the major food for the Sami's reindeer herds.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Herding peoples of the far north of North 
America and Siberia harvest reindeer lichen from the rumen (first 
stomach) of caribou (some disassembly required). This partially 
digested lichen is prepared as a traditional food.  Alaskan inland 
people eat reindeer lichen directly after crushing and boiling it.

<h2>Wila</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_wila01f.jpg" alt="Dried Wila Lichens" class=mrg>
[<i>Bryoria fremontii</i> of family <i>Parmeliaceae</i>]
<p>
This lichen grows in hair-like clumps from tree branches, but is 
not parasitic. It inhabits the Mountain West of North America from 
the south of Alaska almost to Southern California. Some also grows 
in Russia and northern Europe. It was an important food for Native 
Americans and is still occasionally eaten as a traditional food.</p>

<h3>Harvesting:</h3> &nbsp; This is usually done with a long pole 
with a hook on the end. Just stick it into the bunch, twist it around 
and pull it down. This lichen is not readily available commercially. 
<b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Some varieties of Wila, as well as very 
similar lichens, have a high content of toxic Vulpinic Acid. This 
acid is bright yellow, so it will give a yellowish tinge to lichen 
containing it. It is imperfectly soluble in water but can be reduced 
by long soaking, preferably in running water.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is normally done along with root 
vegetables in a large pit with red hot rocks at the bottom and a 
fire on top, cooking for many hours to a few days. This method is not 
entirely practical in a modern kitchen, but some success has been 
reported using a slow cooker. Attempts to use a pressure cooker have 
been unsatisfactory.<p></p>

<h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; once cooked, the gelatinous Wila is formed 
into small loafs, which can be sliced and eaten as is, or dried for 
future use. Sugar or berries are often added to cooked Wila, because 
lichens tend to be slightly bitter. Dried Wila is sometimes crushed 
and used to make a porridge.

<h2>Rock Tripe</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_roktripe02g.jpg" alt="Whole Rock Tripe Lichen" class=mrg>
[Iwatake (Japan); Seogi (Korea); <i>Umbilicaria esculenta</i> of 
family <i>Umbilicariaceae</i>]
<p>
This lichen grows on rocks in East Asia, including Korea, China and 
Japan. It is is extremely slow growing, and all that was easily 
available has long ago been harvested. Harversters rappel down cliffs 
in wet weather (so it won't crumble) to gather it, with occasional 
fatalities. It is particularly favored in Japan, where an absurdly 
high price is the greatest known flavor enhancer.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; It should be soaked long enough to have a 
gelatinous texture. In Korea it is often pan fried with pine nuts. 
In Japan it is prepared as tempura.
