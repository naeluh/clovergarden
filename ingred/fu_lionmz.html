[Pom Pom Mushroom, Bearded Tooth Mushroom, Satyr's Beard, Bearded 
  Hedgehog Mushroom; H&oacute;u T&oacute;u Gu (China, lit. "monkey head 
  mushroom");  Yamabushitake (Japan, lit. "mountain priest mushroom"); 
  Nam Dau Khi (Viet, lit. "monkey head mushroom"); Norugongdengi-beoseot 
  (Korea, lit. "Deertail Mushroom"); <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>]
<p>
These mushroom, native to temperate zones of North America, Europe and 
Asia, are edible and highly medicinal. They are under study for treatment 
of a number of serious conditions, including some cancers, Alzheimer's 
and nerve damage. They grow on hardwood trees, especially Beech, as 
irregular spheres with no stem, covered with long thin soft spines. 
Fruiting bodies are rather rare in the wild, and are Red Listed in 
much of Europe, but are amazingly easy to produce in cultivation.</p>

<p>They are grown commercially on sterilized sawdust logs and similar 
substrates, and harvested young when the spines are still short. The 
largest of the photo specimens was 2.7 inches wide and weighed 0.32 
ounces (9 gms). The soaked one was much like the dried one lower in 
the photo in size and appearance. It weighed 0.18 ounces (5 gms), and 
after soaking and wringing out weighed 1 ounce (28 grams).</p>

To the far left is a mature living specimen growing on a tree. The 
spines are for spore production, but commercially they are cloned from 
particularly good specimens.

<p>To the near left is the soaked specimen from the photo above cut 
in half to show internal detail. These mushrooms are of considerable 
culinary interest in China. In the Buddhist vegetarian cuisine they 
sometimes replace pork in recipes.</p>

<p>Their mild sweet taste is said to make them suitable to replace 
lobster in recipes. Now the flavor is intriguing, but I'm not about to 
tell you they taste much like lobster. They are quite spongy and 
absorb a lot of water, so absorb a lot of flavor from the recipe if you 
wring them out before adding them. They are a little tough, though, 
especially near the attachment point, so are best cooked sliced fairly 
thin.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are fairly popular in Asia, so are 
available in some of the larger Asian markets here in Los Angeles, 
at around 2016 US $1.28 / ounce.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Dried and kept in a sealed container, they 
should last at least a year, though their medicinal properties may 
decline (data deficient).<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Soak for about 30 minutes in warm water. Wring 
them out after slicing if you want them to pick up a lot of flavor from 
the recipe. Of course, the recipe must have enough liquid for them to 
absorb.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The recommendation of North American mushroom 
hunters is to wring them out dry, then saut&eacute; in butter with 
some garlic until lightly browned around the edges. In China they are 
used mainly in soups, where they are prized as a textural element. 
They are also used in a vegetarian mixed mushroom stir fry.<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h3> &nbsp; This mushroom is 
about 20% protein and is safe to eat, as are its near relatives. It has 
many medicinal factors - the most studied are its ability to protect and 
help regenerate damaged nerves. It also appears to be useful in cases 
of Alzheimer's disease and other neuro degenerative  situations - but 
dosage must be continued as the effect fades in a few weeks. It has 
also shown effectiveness as a mood improver for women suffering from 
PMS, and is probably effective against some cancers. This is looking 
to be a very useful mushroom, particularly in that it's so easy to 
cultivate.<p></p>
