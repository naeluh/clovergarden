<h1>Oyster Mushrooms</h1>
<br><img src="img/fu_oysterpl01d.jpg" alt="Oyster Mushrooms in the Wild" class=mrg>
[Abalone Mushrooms, <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>, <i>P. sapidus</i>, 
<i>P. pulmonarus</i>, <i>P. citrino-pileatus</i> and species, all 
within family <i>Pleurotaceae</i>]
<p>
Oyster Mushrooms come in a  number of varieties in different sizes 
and colors, generally of mild flavor. The off-center stem is 
characteristic and many are fan shaped, highly irregular and overlapping. 
some varieties are highly perishable, lasting only a few hours, but some 
are quite durable. Here on the West Coast of the United States, there 
is a tremendous interest in cultivating mushrooms, combining techniques 
from Asia with those developed by growers of "magic mushrooms", and 
a number of new varieties of Oyster Mushroom are now available here.</p>
<p>Sorting mushroom varieties is difficult, because members of the same 
species can take a number of different forms. Some Oyster Mushrooms, 
including the King Trumpets, and Common Oyster Mushrooms, kill and 
consume nematodes (round worms) for additional nutrition.

<h2>Abalone Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_abalon07d.jpg" alt="Canned Abalone Mushrooms" class=mrg> 
[<i>P. cystidiosus</i>]
<p>
This is a small oyster mushroom raised in Taiwan, Thailand and China 
for canning and export. The texture is fairly firm, as befits a canning 
mushroom, and as with all oyster mushrooms, the flavor is mild.  
Personally I think they should rename this mushroom because if anything 
deserves to be called "Abalone Mushroom" it's the 
<a href="fu_oysterz.html#bail">Bailinggu</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Bailinggu</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_bailing06d.jpg" alt="Whole Bai-Ling Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Bai-Ling, Bailing, Abalone Mushroom, <i>Pleurotus tuoliensis</i> - 
formerly <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i> var. <i>ferulae</i>, <i>Pleurotus 
ferulae</i> var. <i>Lanze</i>, <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i> var 
<i>tuoliensis</i> and others]
<p>
If any mushroom deserves the name "abalone mushroom" this is the one. 
Growing to about the size of a very large abalone (the kind you can't 
get any more), sliced it looks like abalone steaks and when cooked it 
even tastes a bit like abalone. It's very meaty and almost chewy, this 
is a really fine mushroom. It is also very durable, able to last more 
than a week loosely bagged in the fridge. </p>
<p>This mushroom is native to the northwest of the Xinjiang Uygur (not 
so) Autonomous Region of China, but is also found in Iran and probably 
other modeately arid regions where the Giant Fennel (genus <i>Ferula</i>) 
is native. In the wild, it is always found in association with these 
plants. This mushroom is now commercially cultivated in China, and was 
easily found in Asian markets here in Los Angeles in 2012 and 2013, but 
I haven't seen the lately (2018, 2019). The photo specimen on the left 
was 4-1/2 inches across and weighed 5-1/2 ounces, about average. The 
photo specimens, purchased in a large Asian market in Alhambra, sold for 
2012 US $3.99 / pound, but up to double that in some other markets.
<br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Common Oyster Mushroom</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_oysterc05d.jpg" alt="Comon Oyster Mushrooms" class=mrg> 
   [<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>, <i>P. pulmonarius</i> and others]
   <p>
   This mushroom grows as a series of tightly packed shelves on the side 
   of tree trunks. It's very fragile, cooks tender but not mushy, and 
   easily absorbs flavors, having a very mild flavor itself. In years 
   past you could only get them canned, but fresh ones have become quite 
   common, at least in Southern California. They are always used cooked, 
   having a touch of bitterness raw. The largest of the photo specimens 
   was 3 inches across. These are often torn up rather than sliced.</p>
   <p>There are a number of varieties which vary in color and durability. 
   The photo specimens were purchased from an Asian market and are pretty 
   sturdy - with care they'll last up to 4 days loosely bagged in the 
   fridge.  Some lighter colored ones from another market were extremely 
   fragile and deteriorated noticeably by time I got them home. Some 
   wild varieties are noted for deteriorating to unusability in several 
   hours.

   <h2>Oyster Mushroom</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_oyster18d.jpg" alt="Harvested Oyster Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [<i>Pleurotus pulmonarius</i>?]   
   <p>
   This form has become increasingly available in Southern California, 
   and is far superior to the Common Oyster Mushroom as its flavor is 
   robust and the caps are relatively strong. It's storage characteristics 
   are good. In it's foam tray, lightly covered in plastic, it will be 
   usable for a week or so. It is sturdy enough for cooking whole, slicing, 
   dicing and other cooking applications. With luck, these will pretty 
   much replace the common oyster mushroom within a few years. The 
   largest of the photo specimens was 3-1/4 inch across. They were 
   packed by a California mushroom grower, but were actually grown 
   in China. 2017 US $3.98 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>King Trumpet, Small</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_king14d.jpg" alt="Clusters of King Trumpet Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [King Oyster, Royal Trumpet; Eryngii (Japan); 
   Brauner Kr&auml;uter-Seitling (Germany); <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i>]
   <p>
   This largest member of the oyster mushroom family comes in a wide 
   variety of sizes. The photo specimens were quite small, to 6 inches 
   high with caps up to 3 inches across. They have little flavor raw, 
   and do not work well in salads, but have good mushroom flavor when 
   cooked, and remain fairly firm even with long cooking.</p>
   <p>I particularly favor the now widely available Hokto brand (Hokto 
   Kinoko Co., San Marcos California), a USDA certified Organic brand 
   of small King Trumpet mushrooms (see photo). These last so long in 
   an unopened package (over two weeks) I can always have fresh mushrooms 
   on hand. On the other hand, some stores keep them too long - if the 
   lower stem is darker than in the photo, reject them. Brands imported 
   from Asia have not been as good. 2016 US $3.31 to $4.98 / pound 
   depending on store.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>King Trumpet, Tiny</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_kingm02d.jpg" alt="Several Tiny King Trumpet Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [King Oyster, Royal Trumpet; Eryngii (Japan); 
   Brauner Kr&auml;uter-Seitling (Germany); <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i>]
   <p>
   These mineature versions of the largest member of the oyster mushroom 
   family appeared here in Los Angeles in late 2019. They varied from 
   1-1/8 inches to 2-3/4 inches high. Their cooking characteristics were 
   just the same as the Large King Trumpets (see below). They were 
   purchased rom a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 
   2019 US $2.27 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   
   <h2>King Trumpet, Large</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_king16d.jpg" alt="Two large King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [King Oyster, Royal Trumpet; Eryngii (Japan); 
   Brauner Kr&auml;uter-Seitling (Germany); <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i>]
   <p>These largest of the Oyster Mushrooms are native to all sides of 
   the Mediterranean region, but are now grown in vast quantity 
   in China. They are available in almost all the Asian markets here in 
   Southern California, and are harvested when they are still nearly 
   all stem with hardly any cap. The stems are often around 2-1/2 inches 
   diameter with caps around 3 inches diameter. The photo specimen on 
   the right was 7-1/4 inches long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 
   9-5/8 ounces, a fairly normal size. Left to mature, the caps would 
   fan out to a larger size.</p>
   <p>These mushrooms have little flavor raw and don't work well in 
   salads, but they have good mushroom flavor cooked. They are usually 
   sliced crosswise or into lengthwise  sticks or slices. Cut lengthwise, 
   they are more mushroomy, and crosswise they are more absorbent of 
   other flavors. They remain fairly firm even with long cooking.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>King Trumpet, Large Dried</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_kingd03d.jpg" alt="Slices of Dried King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [King Oyster, Abalone Mushroom, Royal Trumpet; Eryngii (Japan); 
   Brauner Kr&auml;uter-Seitling (Germany); <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i>]
   <p>The package listed these as <i>Pleurotus abalones</i>, but there 
   is no such scientific name - somebody made it up from the fact that 
   these, and other large oyster mushrooms, are sometimes called 
   "Abalone Mushrooms". The larges piece in the photo was 5-1/2 inches 
   long and 2 inches wide, but there was on (less photogenic) piece in 
   the package that was 7 inches long. They were purchased from a large 
   Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $2.29 for 
   2-1/2 ounces.</p>
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Oyster Mushroom</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_oyster09d.jpg" alt="Cluster of Oyster Mushrooms" class=mrg>
   [<i>Pleurotus pulmonarius</i>?]
   <p>
   This form in clusters is not common, but occasionally available in 
   Southern California. While it has a more distinct cap than common 
   oyster mushrooms, it still displays the off-center stem. These are 
   firmer than the common oyster mushroom and can stand a bit more 
   abuse during cooking.
