<h1>Straw Mushrooms</h1>
<br><img src="img/fu_straw08g.jpg" alt="Canned and Dried Straw Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Thai straw mushroom, Paddy Straw Mushroom, <i>Volvariella volvacea</i>]
<p>
These are grown on rice straw and are not yet widely available fresh even 
in California. They are, however, available canned in stores catering to 
Asian communities. &nbsp; <u>Caution:</u> &nbsp; Mistaking the almost 
identical but highly toxic death cap (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>) for 
straw mushrooms has resulted in death and/or need for liver transplants 
among Asian immigrants to the US and Australia.</p>

<p>Straw mushrooms are canned in two forms: egg shaped with the cap and 
stem still completely encapsulated by a shroud called the volva, or 
partially opened with a conical cap on a short thick stem. These are 
called "unpeeled" and "peeled" on the can but the "peeled" is just a more 
mature form of the "unpeeled". The unpeeled can be much larger than the 
one in the photo. They are also available dried (right in photo) but not 
so commonly. Straw Mushrooms are very important in Southeast Asian 
cuisines, particularly Thai. In Vietnam they may be found growing wild 
on old termite mounds. These are much stronger in flavor than cultivated 
and fetch a much higher price.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are available canned in almost all markets 
serving East Asian and especially Southeast Asian communities. They are 
commonly packed in 15oz/425gm net weight cans. Drained weight will vary 
from 7oz/200gm to 8oz/225gm. Recipes should always call for drained 
weight but sometimes they call out by the can (1 can, 1/2 can). That 
will always be the 15oz can.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In an unopened can they will keep for a a couple 
of years without problems. Once the can is opened put them in a tightly 
sealed jar in the refrigerator covered with the liquid from the can and 
they will last a week or so.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Straw mushrooms are almost always cooked (and 
canned ones are already lightly cooked in the canning process). Peeled 
straw mushrooms are generally used in soups because they're too fragile 
for stir fries and the like. Unpeeled work fine in stir fries, especially 
since they're always added right near the end. Canned mushrooms require 
only momentary cooking to bring them up to temperature. When using the 
unpeeled they present a more interesting effect if cut in half lengthwise 
as shown in the photo. If you get them at just the right stage they look 
like happy alien faces.<p></p>

<p>Dried straw mushrooms aren't common, but are available in larger Asian 
markets. They are somewhat different (a little more intense) in flavor, 
but still recognizable as straw mushrooms. Soak them in hot water for 1/2 
hour before cooking with them, and do use the soaking liquid in the 
recipe, it is quite good.<p></p>
