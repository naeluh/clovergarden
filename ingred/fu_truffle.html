<h1>Truffles</h1>
<br><img src="img/fu_trufpw02h.jpg" alt="White Truffle" class=mrg>

of order <i>Pezizales</i>]
<p>
Truffles, black, white or whatever, are the fruiting bodies of 
fungi related to Morels and Cup Fungi. They have long been a hallmark of 
gourmet cuisine, but the most desirable species have become scarce and 
exceedingly expensive. Efforts to cultivate them continue with mixed 
success. The basic problem is that truffles live in a symbiotic 
relationship with the roots of living trees, of a particular species, 
and can't be grown without the trees. Trees take up a lot of room, so 
yield per acre is low. There are a lot of species of truffle, but we 
have listed here mainly those that are currently commercially available.

<p>One mystery has recently been solved - why some people rave about 
truffles and others just don't see the point. If you have not been 
exposed to truffles over some period of time <u>don't bother with the 
expense</u> until you've checked them out. 25% can't smell them at all 
and 40% hate them, but those who've been exposed to them for some time 
come to love them. It's a chemical thing (androstenone).<p>

<h3>Buying and Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh truffles have far more aroma 
and flavor than frozen or preserved truffles, <u>but are extremely 
perishable</u>. They should be used the day purchased if at all possible. 
Beyond three days they are hopelessly degraded. Most truffles purchased 
in North America are purchased on-line, and shipped Tuesday through 
Thursday by overnight express.<p></p>
<p>Some truffles are packed in white rice, which can extend their 
usability a few days, but which tends to dehydrate them with loss of 
aroma. It is suggested to use the rice for risotto or the like because 
it will have absorbed some of the flavor.</p>
<p>Oregon truffles are often shipped not yet ripe (as explained below), 
but can be greatly improved by letting them ripen. They are ready when 
they become just slightly softer. When moisture starts to appear on the 
outside, and then they must be used <u>now</u>.</p>


<br><img src="img/ke_trufplane01k.jpg" alt="Truffle Plane" class=mrg>
<h3>Prep <small>&amp;</small> Cooking</h3>
<p><b>White Piedmont</b> 
truffles are almost never cooked at all, but shaved paper thin (use a 
truffle plane) and served atop salads, pasta dishes and the like, 
applied at the last moment before serving.</p>
<p><b>Black P&eacute;rigord</b> truffles are more durable and are commonly 
used in cooked dishes, applied in the last minutes of cooking, shaved 
or grated. They are quite compatible with fatty foods and are often 
shaved thin and slipped under the skin of game birds and the like. They 
are particularly compatible with omelets and scrambled eggs. They are 
also used just shaved or grated over pasta dishes, particularly those 
with creamy sauces, and other such dishes, always just before serving.
</p>
<p>In times past chefs peeled truffles, but truffles were cheap then 
and their customers very wealthy. Today, they are rarely peeled, just 
scrubbed, then shaved. If your recipe demands they be peeled, scrub 
first, then use the peels for some other dish.

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

  <h2>Truffle Oil / Truffle Vodka</h2> 
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufoil01k.jpg" alt="Jar of Truffle Oil" class=mrg>   
   <p>
   <u>Be Aware</u>: &nbsp; Most commercial "truffle oil" has never had 
   intimate relations with an actual truffle. These olive and grapeseed 
   oils are mixed with the chemical thioether (2,4-dithiapentane), just 
   one of the many flavor and aroma elements in actual truffles. This 
   concoction is roundly despised by reputable chefs, but is much used 
   to flavor popcorn served with champaign (a current fad), French fries, 
   and sometimes mashed potatoes or pasta.</p>
   <p>In contrast, real truffle oil has complex flavors and aromas and 
   is considered a "chef's dream". It is, however, a little costly for 
   pouring over popcorn. Truffle Vodka is now being made, using real 
   truffles. It is usually drunk straight or in cocktails, but some 
   chefs have started using it as a cooking ingredient.

   <h2>European Black Truffles</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufpg01h.jpg" alt="European Black Truffle" class=mrg>
   <p>[<i>Tuber melanosporum</i> (P&eacute;rigord) and <i>Tuber aestivum</i> 
   (Burgundy / Summer), both of family <i>Tuberaceae</i>]
   </p><p>
   These are the truffles of France, usually found associated with oak, 
   hazelnut and cherry trees. They are less pungent and more refined in 
   flavor than Piedmont white truffles, and are usually 4 inches or less 
   in diameter, but have been found weighing nearly 3 pounds. They are 
   harvested from November to March. Black truffles are now cultivated 
   in Australia, New Zealand and North America in plantings of 
   hazelnut trees (for two harvests). They sell for around to 2013 US 
   $130 per ounce, not nearly as high as white truffles.

   <p>The Burgundy truffle is less intensely aromatic than the 
   P&eacute;rigord, and there is a probably ecological variant of the 
   Burgundy Truffle called the "Summer Truffle" which was formerly 
   considered a separate species. It's flesh is lighter in color and it 
   is less intensely aromatic. Burgundy Truffles can be had for 2014 
   US $30 to 40 per ounce, Summer Truffles for about 2014 US $20 per 
   ounce.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>White Piedmont Truffles</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufpw01h.jpg" alt="Piedmont White Truffle" class=mrg>
   <p>[<i>Tuber magnatum</i> of family <i>Tuberaceae</i>]
   </p><p>
   These truffles are found mainly in the Piedmont region of northwest 
   Italy, but some are also found in Tuscany, southeast France and 
   western Croatia and Slovenia. They have far outpaced the black 
   truffle in price, some selling for as much as 2009 US $737 per 
   ounce, but some can occasionally be had for under $300 per ounce. 
   They are usually smaller than black truffles, but have been found 
   weighing as much as 3.3 pounds. Harvest begins in October.</p>
   <p>These truffles are hunted using mongrel dogs (purebreds can't 
   smell them). Pigs are even better at finding truffles, but, 
   unfortunately, pigs eat truffles, while dogs just want a doggy 
   treat. The photo specimen has a patch shaved off at the left so 
   the internal texture and color are exposed.

   <h2>Bianchetto truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufbo01h.jpg" alt="Whitish Bianchetto Truffle" class=mrg>
   [Tuscan Truffle, Spring Truffle,  <i>Tuber borchii</i> of family 
   <i>Tuberaceae</i>]
   <p>
   These "whitish" truffles are found most commonly in Tuscany in 
   northwest    Italy, but some are also found in Marche and Piedmont. 
   They range from 1/2 inch to 1-1/2 inches diameter and are said to 
   have a more garlicky flavor than the white truffle. Harvest is 
   between January and April. They are available in season for about 
   2014 US $30 per ounce.

   <h2>Oregon White Truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufow01c.jpg" alt="Oregon White Truffle, cut" class=mrg>
   <p>[<i>Tuber gibbosum</i> var. <i>gibbosum</i>, var. <i>autumnale</i> 
   and var. <i>oregonense</i>]
   </p><p>
   Oregon white truffles are rather new to the market, but are 
   rapidly gaining popularity. Of course, the French call them "false 
   truffles", but most chefs seem quite happy with them - especially at 
   around 2019 US $21 per ounce, a fraction of the price for 
   White Piedmont truffles. Unfortunately, due to their low price, 
   Oregon truffles are harvested by raking rather than hunting with dogs. 
   This results in damage to the truffles and host trees, as well as 
   degrading quality (thus the price), with many unripe truffles 
   harvested. These can be ripened successfully if not too immature.</p>
   <p>These truffles grow in association with fast growing Douglas Fir 
   trees, and most are harvested from tree farms. They can be found from 
   northern California to British Columbia, Canada, along the Cascade 
   mountain range. Some success has been reported cultivating these 
   truffles on Christmas tree farms. They normally range from 1/2 inch 
   to 2 inches diameter, rarely to 3 inches and ripen from October 
   through March. Currently, only var. <i>autumnale</i> is harvested 
   in commercial quantity.

   <h3>Oregon Black Truffle</h3>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufob02h.jpg" alt="Oregon Black Truffle cut" class=mrg>
   <p>[Chartreuse Truffle (France); <i>Leucangium carthusianum</i>]
   </p><p>
   These have reached the market more recently than the Oregon 
   white truffle and are much less common, but are gaining popularity. 
   Most chefs seem quite happy with them - especially at around 2019 US 
   $24 per ounce, a fraction of the cost of French black truffles. 
   Unfortunately, due to their low price, Oregon truffles are harvested 
   by raking rather than hunted with dogs. This results in damage to the 
   truffles and host trees, as well as degrading quality (thus the 
   price), with many unripe truffles harvested. These can be ripened 
   successfully if not too immature.</p>
   <p>In Oregon, these truffles grow in association with fast growing 
   Douglas Fir trees, and most are harvested from tree farms, but in 
   France they are associated with other trees. They can be found from 
   northern California to British Columbia, Canada, along the Cascade 
   mountain range. These ripen from January to June and can grow to 
   around 3 inches in diameter. They grow deeper than the white 
   Oregon truffles.

   <h2>Oregon Brown Truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufobn01h.jpg" alt="Oregon Brown Truffles, whole" class=mrg>
   <p>[<i>Kalapuya brunnea</i> of family <i>Morchellaceae</i> (Morels)]
   </p><p>
   This truffle, found in northern California and western Oregon,
   has only been scientifically described in 2010. It is closely related 
   to the Morel mushroom, but certainly doesn't resemble it at all. 
   This truffle is not yet a commercial item, but is very edible and has 
   been harvested in Oregon, though not to the extent of the white or 
   black. The aroma of mature truffles resembles garlicky cheese, similar 
   to mature Camembert.  They are usually between 1/2 inch and 2-3/8 
   inches in diameter. Like the others, they live associated with Douglas 
   Fir trees.

   <h2>California Truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufca01h.jpg" alt="California Truffles, whole, cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Choiromyces alveolatum</i>]
   <p>
   This is the most common example of a number of little known 
   truffles that can be found from Northern California north into 
   Washington State. Most are associated with Douglas Fir forests and 
   can grow to 2 inches in diameter. Their culinary characteristics are 
   currently little known, and how productive they are is also unknown.

   <h2>Pecan Truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufpc01k.jpg" alt="Pecan Truffle, whole" class=mrg>
   [<i>Tuber lyonii</i>]<p>
   This fairly large truffle, growing to 4-3/4 inches across, 
   is found associated with pecan trees.  These trees and truffles grow 
   mainly in the southeast of the United States, but are also found in 
   the Great Lakes states of Minnesota, Michigan and Ohio. Formerly, 
   pecan growers raked them up with fallen pecans and discarded them as 
   a nuisance, but now they sell for 2018 US $16 to $18 per ounce. 
   Pecan growers are now starting to use Truffle Dogs to sniff them out, 
   improving quality and availability. Work is ongoing inoculating trees 
   to provide a more consistent crop.</p>
   <p>The orchards are quite productive, and the truffles are harvested 
   between September and February - later in the south than in the north. 
   The interior is tan to brown with white marbling and has a pleasant 
   nutty aroma. They are best freshly shaved onto warm, rich, buttery 
   dishes such as eggs, pasta, polenta or potatoes.

   <h2>Desert Truffles</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufkd01h.jpg" alt="Whole Desert Truffle" class=mrg>   
   [Kalahari Truffle, Hungarian Honey Truffle; family 
   <i>Terfeziaceae</i>, genera <i>Terfezia</i>, <i>Tirmania</i> and 
   <i>Mattirolomyces</i>]
   <p>
   These truffles are found in the Kalahari desert of southern 
   Africa, and in arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean basin 
   from Spain across North Africa and as far north as Turkey, Croatia and 
   Hungary. Some are found in China. These truffles do not have the same 
   intense aroma of European and Oregon truffles, but can be more widely 
   used because of a much lower price. They can grow up to 10 ounces and 
   are usually associated with <i>Helianthemum</i> shrubs. The photo 
   specimen was from Turkey.</p>
   <p>The African nation of Namibia has a sizeable crop of these truffles 
   from the sandy grasslands of the Kalahari Desert. They are spotted by 
   looking for small cracks in the sand, and are sold cheaply in the 
   local markets.  The crop is not, however, reliable enough to build an 
   export market, though that is being worked on.

   <p>The Hungarian or Honey Truffle (<i>Mattirolomyces terfezioides</i>) 
   was very popular in Central Europe during the days of the 
   Austro-Hungarian Empire, but fell out of favor during the period of 
   the World Wars, and was banned by the Communists for "bourgeois 
   decadence". It is found associated with black locust trees, and is a 
   very light beige color inside. The initial taste is said to be "lightly 
   mushroomy", but followed by a lingering honey sweetness. They can 
   be had for about 2014 US $25 per ounce.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Chinese Truffle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/fu_trufch01h.jpg" alt="Whole Chinese Truffle" class=mrg>   
   [<i>Tuber indicum</i>]
   <p>
   This truffles is less aromatic and has a far lower commercial 
   value than the Black Truffle (about 2014 US $17 per ounce), but has 
   often been used in fraudulent sales. It's skin is smoother  than the 
   black and tends to be browner. A genetic test has been developed to 
   quickly identify this species. A bunch of new species have been 
   found (2011, 2012) in Yunan and Sichuan provinces of China, but 
   are not yet commercially exploited. Hopefully, the Chinese have not 
   yet figured out how to enhance these with lead, China's favorite 
   ingredient.
