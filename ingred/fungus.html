<h1>Fungus &nbsp; - &nbsp; <small>Including Molds <small>&amp;</small> Yeast</small></h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Fungi (kingdom <i>Fungi</i>) are not plants. This was 
already known, but DNA research has revealed that Mushrooms are 
genetically closely related to Animals. Some enterprising fungus is 
probably the ancestor of the entire animal kingdom.</span>
<p>An individual fungus may weigh more than a blue whale, all hidden in 
the ground, but 400 million years ago, Prototaxites, now known to be 
fungus, towered over all other land life on Earth at nearly 30 feet 
tall.</p>
<p></p>Many fungi are highly medicinal with  antiviral and antitumor 
properties. Some are noted below, but this is a culinary page, so  
commonly eaten mushrooms (and a few to avoid eating) are covered here.

<p><b><i>Opisthokonts</i></b> are a clade of single celled organisms 
within the animal lineage, <i>Podiata</i>. Two populations of this clade 
separately developed into very complex multi-celular organisms: 
<b>Fungus</b> and <a href="animal.html"><b>Animals</b></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike plants, animals and fungi can not generate their own substance 
and energy from sunlight and raw materials. They subsist entirely by 
breaking down and absorbing dead or living plant or animal material. 
Fungi also break down rock, absorbing minerals and making them available 
to plants. Like animals, but unlike plants, mushrooms generate Vitamin D 
from exposure to sunlight.</p>

<p><img src="img/fu_mycel01e.jpg" alt="Mycelium" class=mrg>
The photo to the left shows what the main body of a fungus we would call 
a "mushroom" actually looks like. The fibers are called "mycelium", and 
live in the ground or in decaying vegetation. Some are among the largest, 
heaviest living things on earth - but all unseen to us. Under some 
circumstances, such as food supply stress, they send up fruiting bodies 
which are the "mushrooms" we pick for food or "medicinal purposes".

<p>It is now suspected by some botanists that the network of mycelium 
may act as an Internet for plants, as some start taking defensive 
measures in respond to problems experienced by similar plants at a 
considerable distance. It is already known that the mycelium network 
acts as a plumbing system amongst plants, distributing water and 
nutrients. Many fungi live in a close relationship with particular 
trees or shrubs, providing minerals and nitrogen in exchange for 
carbhydrates and water.</p>

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Mushroom Varieties</h2>

<p>This is by no means a comprehensive list, but includes those I've 
found available for purchase at reasonable prices here in Southern 
California. Not included are most of the edible varieties only found 
wild, though I have included links to sites that do list those.</p>

<p>Not long ago it was difficult to find any but supermarket white 
mushrooms, but with a proliferation of ethnic markets in the US, variety 
is growing steadily and prices are declining. Because of its large Asian 
population, many mushroom growing operations have been set up in 
California. Currently (2010) there is a large operation being set up as 
a joint venture with Japan. and this should improve the situation even 
more as it ramps up.</p>

<p>Many mushrooms are highly toxic, and some toxic varieties look very 
much like edible ones, so wild mushrooms need to be carefully identified 
before consumption. A few varieties which are themselves non-toxic cause 
alcohol to become highly toxic.

<h2 id="ama">Amanita</h2> 
<br><img src="img/fu_amanita01e.jpg" alt="Amanita" class=mrg>
[<i>Amanita muscaria</i> and many other Amanita spp.]
<p>This large family of mushrooms includes many highly toxic varieties that 
should not be consumed on penalty of death (self enforcing). 
Milder varieties are sometimes taken in sub-lethal doses for psychoactive 
purposes beyond the scope of this document. Some Amanitas are used in 
cooking but rarely in the US.</p>
<p>With proper preparation (boiling in plenty 
of salted water which is discarded) the dread Amanita muscaria (photo) has 
been reported edible, but other toxic mushrooms are not disarmed by cooking.
Death from mushroom poisoning is generally from liver failure, takes several 
days and is not pleasant.

<h2>Black Fungus</h2>
<br><a href="fu_blackz.html">
<img src="img/fu_blackfungus01d.jpg" alt="Black Fungus, dried and rehydrated" class=mrg></a>
[Wood Ear, Cloud Ear; Kikurage (Japan); Mu-ehr 
(China); <i>Auricularia polytricha</i>, also <i>A. auricula-judae</i>, 
<i>Hirneola auricula-judae</i> and others (variation in color)]
<p>
This thin nearly black fungus was formerly only sold dried, and will 
expand to about 4 times the dried volume when soaked. Today it can often 
be purchased fresh in Asian markets here in Los Angeles. In China and 
Korea, it is often used in soups and stir fries for its slippery but 
crunchy texture. It has little flavor of its own but does absorb flavors 
from other ingredients it's cooked with. In the photo there are three 
dried ones on the left, each a little over and inch across, and on the 
right a rehydrated one that was originally the same size as one of the 
others.</p>
<p>It is held in Chinese medicine to improve blood circulation and relieve 
atherosclerosis. Preliminary tests in Western medicine are encouraging and 
include confirmation of anticoagulant properties.

<h2>Black Trumpet</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_blktrump03e.jpg" alt="Whole Black Trumpet Mushrooms" class=mrg> 
[Black Chanterelle, Horn of Plenty, Trumpet of Death; Trumpets de Mort
(French); <i>Craterellus cornucopioides</i>]
<p>
These mushrooms belong to a genus closely related to  Chanterelles 
(<i>Cantharellus</i>). They tend to look pretty ugly, often tattered, but 
the flavor and aroma are excellent, and they stay reasonably firm when 
cooked. They are usually found wild in leaf debris of temperate deciduous 
forests in North America, Europe and southern Australia, particularly 
around oaks.</p>  

<p>Black Trumpets are particularly popular in France, where they are quite 
common. They dry well, and dry ones are sometimes powdered as a flavoring. 
Some use black trumpets (fresh or dry) to flavor dry white wine, slipping 
a few into a freshly opened bottle and refrigerating overnight. The 
largest of the photo specimens was 7 inches long and 2 inches in 
diameter, weighing 3/4 ounce. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Blewit</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_blewit01d.jpg" alt="Whole Blue Foot Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Blue Foot (when cultivated); <i>Lepista nuda</i>]
<p>
Wild and cultivated mushrooms with blue tinted stalks and light beige caps. 
These mushrooms should be cooked to bring out their unique flavor and because 
some people are sensitive to blewit toxins when eaten raw. Their flavor is 
robust enough to complement casseroles, risottos and other substantial dishes 
- if you can afford them. The cultivated photo specimens, purchased at Whole 
Foods Market for $40/pound, were typically 2 inches across the cap and weighed 
1/2 ounce each. 
<br class=cll></p>

[Girolle (Italy), Pfifferling (Germany), <i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>, 
<i>C. craterellus</i> and other spp.]
<p>
This funnel shaped mushroom is very highly regarded among food 
enthusiasts in Europe and North America. They are only found wild since 
all attempts to cultivate them commercially have failed, so they are 
seasonal and expensive. Always served cooked to bring out their woodsy 
flavor, they are sturdy and can stand up to being stirred and 
saut&eacute;ed.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chaga</h2> 
<br><img src="img/fu_chaga01h.jpg" alt="Chaga Infection on Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Inonotus obliquus</i> of family <i>Hymenochaetaceae</i>]
<p>
This parasitic fungus grows on white birch trees in very cold regions 
around the Northern Hemisphere. The clinker itself is sterile - it does 
not fruit until the tree it is growing on has died. In parts of Siberia it 
is used to make a tea in place of regular tea or coffee. This tea is said 
to have medicinal properties, particularly against cancer. Scientific 
study is ongoing, but so far inconclusive. Regardless of the result, Chaga 
can't be used generally because the supply is too limited, and cultivated 
examples lack potency &nbsp;

<a href="fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a><p></p>


<h2>"Cordyceps"</h2>

<p>Within fungus order <i>Hypocreales</i> are  seven families, a 
couple of which are noted for a few species that are culinary / 
medicinal items. These are generally called <i>Cordyceps</i>, though 
they may or may not still be so named in scientific circles. Those so 
noted parasitize insects. Cordyceps is not a culinary item in North 
America, but soups with medicinal properties are very popular with 
East Asians, so cordyceps is used in some of them.</p>

   <h3>Caterpillar Fungus</h3>
   <br><img src="img/fu_cordy01d.jpg" alt="Fungi with Caterpillars" class=mrg>
   [Cs-4; Champignon Chenille (French); Yartsa Gunbu (Tibet); Dong chong 
   xia cao (Chinese); <i>Ophiocordyceps sinensis</i> formerly <i>Cordyceps 
   sinensis</i>, now of family <i>Ophiocordycipitaceae</i>]
   <p>
   This fungus parasitizes a specific moth caterpillar. It came to strong 
   attention in the West in 1993 when the spectacular Olympic performance 
   of some Chinese women was ascribed to "cordyceps and turtle blood". 
   Demand for cordyceps became intense among our athletes, notorious for 
   doing absolutely <u>anything</u> to improve performance. Later 
   circumstances strongly suggest it was something other than cordyceps 
   that provided the performance boost.</p>
   <p>It matters not - cordyceps is now embedded in the minds of the 
   "health conscious", causing the price to skyrocket. "Best quality 
   large larva" has exceeded 2008 US $500 per ounce. It is sold complete 
   with caterpillar because the caterpillar innards have been completely 
   consumed and replaced with fungus. No attempt to cultivate this fungus 
   in caterpillars has been successful. In China, <i>O. sinensis</i> is 
   cultivated in a broth of mashed silkworms. In the U.S. and Japan, it is 
   cultivated on grain - not as good, but the FDA has yet to approve 
   silkworm mash for human consumption. Research is ongoing to determine 
   if any of the myriad medicinal benefits claimed by Asian medicine 
   (everything from treating erectile dysfunction to curing cancer) 
   are valid.

   [Species and family not yet identified]
   <p>
   This branching form of cordyceps is common in the large Asian markets 
   here in Los Angeles (insects not included). The photo specimens were 
   purchased for 2017 US $2.99 for 1.8 ounces.</p>
   <p>Package instructions (with a little correction in wording) are to 
   rinse in cold water, then cook with other desired ingredients and 
   serve hot. Serving size given was one cup, using the entire 1.8 
   ounces.

<h2>Crab Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_crab03d.jpg" alt="Cluster of White Crab Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Seafood Mushroom; <i>Hypsyzygus tessulatus</i> alt <i>H. marmoreus</i>]
<p>
This appears to be a cultivar of the <a href="fungus.html#hon">Shimeji</a> group, 
very similar to the white Hon-Shimeji except for the very long relatively 
thick stem. They stand up quite well to light cooking, as in soups. The 
flavor mellows a little but stays about the same. This cluster was 7 
inches long and weighed 4-1/2 ounces. The largest caps were about 7/8 
inch across, though I have seen bigger ones.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="crimi">Crimini</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_crimini01d.jpg" alt="Whole Crimini Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Italian Brown; <i>Agaricus bisporus</i>]
<p>
Similar to the <a href="fungus.html#white">White Mushroom</a> (note the same 
species name) but darker in color and with a deeper, earthier flavor. 
These are called for in many Italian recipes. They will keep up to 7 
days refrigerated in a paper bag.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Crimson Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_crimson01e.jpg" alt="Live Crimson Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Scarlet Waxcap; <i>Hygrocybe punicea</i>]
<p>
These deep red mushrooms with widely space yellow or yellow-red gills 
and stems are found in grasslands in Laos, Cambodia, North America and 
parts of Europe. The caps start out bell shape, then flatten to 1-1/2 
to 4 inches across. They are mild tasting and commonly eaten in Laos 
and Cambodia. I have a Cambodian cookbook calling for them, but the 
recipe fails to mention when they should be included in the stir fry. 
They are listed as edible in Europe, but there have been reports of 
adverse reactions in North America. Subst: firmer versions of oyster 
mushrooms will work, except for color. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Djon Djon</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_psathc01h.jpg" alt="Growing Djon Djon mushrooms" class=mrg>
[<i>Psathyrella hymenocephala</i>, <i>P. coprinoceps</i> or similar]
<p>
This fungus has been very difficult to pin down, but the leading 
candidates are <i>Psathyrella</i> species <i>hymenocephala</i> and 
<i>coprinoceps</i>. Dried, it has been important in the cuisine of Haiti 
as the key ingredient in the popular national rice dishes, Riz Djon-djon 
and Riz Noir.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has recently become scarce and very 
expensive (around 2015 US $72 / pound). This is not surprising. This 
fungus lives on rotting wood, and the Haitians have almost totally 
deforested their end of the island. The border can easily be seen from 
space, in many places desert brown on the Haiti side and bright green on 
the Dominican Republic side. Our photo is of <i>P. candolleana</i>, 
closely related to both the suspect species (they all look pretty much 
alike).

<h2>Earthstar</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_earthstar01d.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Earthstar Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Black Mushroom; <i>Astraeus hygrometricus</i>]
<p>
Varieties of this mushroom grow wild in northern California, but these are 
canned ones from Thailand. The can was labeled with three names, 
"Black Mushroom", "Earthstar" and <i>Astraeus hygrome trieus</i>. These 
mushrooms are the shape of a slightly flattened leathery sphere which 
encloses a puffball. When the fungus is ripe, and the weather is damp, 
the sphere breaks into a star shape exposing the puffball. If the weather 
dries the star closes. These were picked well before maturity. Be aware 
that safety of wild varieties is not proven. See links 
(<a href="fungus.html#f06">F6</a> and <a href="fungus.html#f07">F7</a>)</p>
<p>The spherical enclosure is somewhat crunchy and a bit leathery in 
texture. Simmering for half an hour softens it only a little, but the 
mushroom develops an interesting meaty flavor - more meaty than any other 
mushroom on this page. The larger photo specimens are about 1 inch 
diameter while the smallest in the can was 1/2 inch. They averaged a 
little under 1/4 ounce each.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Enoki</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_enoki18d.jpg" alt="Cluster of White Enoki" class=mrg>
[<i>Flammulina veluptipes</i>]<p>
This distinctive mushroom grows in clusters of long thin stems 
each topped with a very small round cap. A favorite of Japanese cuisine, 
they have a mild flavor and a slight crunch and are generally used raw. 
If you attempt to cook them, they become limp and stringy and the flavor 
does not improve. left attached to their growing matrix and loosely 
wrapped they will keep up to 14 days in the refrigerator.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Enoki - Golden</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_mrxxa06d.jpg" alt="Cluster of Golden Enoki??" class=mrg>
These have just appeared in some of the Asian markets in Los Angeles 
(2012) - until now enokis were always white. The photo specimens were 
3-1/2 inches high and the caps were up to 0.28 inches diameter but they 
grew much longer in the refrigerator. These seem a bit sweeter with a 
bit more mushroom flavor than regular enokis. When cooked they remain 
crunchy, but the color becomes muddy and the flavor a bit washed out. 
All in all, I think these are best used raw scattered as a garnish as 
the white enokis are.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2>Hazelnut Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_hazel02e.jpg" alt="Dried Hazelnut Mushrooms" class=mrg>
The package says these mushrooms are found in Northeast China growing 
under hazelnut trees. From fragments in the package it looks like these 
can grow to about 3 inches diameter, but most were much smaller. The 
package suggests these be used in stews, stir fries and soups.
<p>This mushroom produces a dark soaking liquid with a dark, woodsy, 
slightly sharp, slightly spicy flavor. The caps stay fairly firm. The 
stems should be chopped for use. Use these in recipes where stronger 
flavors are appropriate.
<br class=cll></p>

[Beech Mushroom, Clamshell Mushroom; <i>Hypsyzygus tessulatus</i> alt 
<i>H. marmoreus</i>]
<p>
In nature these tiny mushrooms grow high in beech trees but are 
grown commercially on prepared corn cobs. They're sold in clusters of 
medium length stems with caps 1 inch in diameter and smaller. Both light 
tan cap and white cap varieties are sold in Asian markets. They are used 
cooked (they're a bit bitter raw) and "stem on", saut&eacute;ed or in 
stir fries or soups, and remain slightly crunchy even with longer 
cooking. The flavor is quite mild, slightly sweet, slightly nutty so 
use them in dishes that won't overpower them. Left on their substrate, 
they will keep for about 10 days refrigerated in a paper bag.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Jinding Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_jinding02e.jpg" alt="Dried Jinding Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Elm Yellow Mushroom, Jade Emperor Mushroom, Orange Mushroom, 
Elm Sanyuan Mushroom; <i>Pleurotus citrinopileatus</i>]
<p>
These are very fragile dried, but cook up rather firm, with the somewhat 
tough stem fading into the cap. It's best to chop them up after soaking. 
The soaking liquid is light and mushroomy. They would be good for light 
soups and the like. The largest in a package obtained from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles was 1.6 inches diameter with a 2 inch long stem, 
but most were much smaller. 
<br class=cll></p>

(Korea, lit. "Deertail Mushroom"); <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>]
<p>
These mushroom, native to temperate zones of North America, Europe and 
Asia, are edible and highly medicinal. They are under study for treatment 
of a number of serious conditions, including some cancers, Alzheimer's 
and nerve damage. They grow on hardwood trees, especially Beech, as 
irregular spheres with no stem, covered with long thin soft spines. 
Fruiting bodies are are rather rare in the wild, and are Red Listed in 
much of Europe, but are amazingly easy to produce in cultivation.

<h2>Lobster Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_lobster02d.jpg" alt="Large Lobster Mushroom" class=mrg>
[<i>Hypomyces lactifluorum</i> growing parasitically on <i>Russula</i> 
or <i>Lactarius</i> species mushrooms.]
<p>
This is a case where a mold-like fungus parasitizes a mushroom, 
transforming it into something different. When the parasite is mature 
the host mushroom may be impossible to identify, but it has not been 
known to infect poisonous mushrooms. The photo specimen, purchased at 
a Southern California farmer's market, was 5-1/4 x 4-3/8 inches and at 
its thickest point was 1-5/8 inches thick. Weighing 4-7/8 ounces, it 
cost US $8.24 or $1.69/ounce.</p>
<p>Exact flavor can depend on the host mushroom. In the case of 
<i>Lactarius piperatus</i> it tones down the hotness and makes it 
more edible. Texture is firm, somewhat crunchy, and remains so 
with cooking. This mushroom is often used in soups, particularly 
seafood soups since it sometimes has a sort of seafood flavor.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Maitake</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_maitake05d.jpg" alt="Cluster of Maitake Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Hen of the Woods; <i>Grifola frondosa</i>]
<p>
These frilly funguses start from a tough base and become somewhat 
crumbly at the outer edges. They are just a bit bitter raw and are 
generally cooked to bring out their woodsy taste and distinctive aroma. 
Maitakes have generally been hard to get and very expensive, around US 
$25/pound, but prices are dropping as production methods are improved. 
I purchased these, imported from Japan, for about 2012 US $7.50/pound 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles. This cluster was about 4-1/2 
inches across and weighed 4-1/4 ounces. Left on their substrate and 
loosely wrapped they will keep up to 10 days refrigerated.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Morel</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_morel01d.jpg" alt="Morel" class=mrg>
[<i>Morchella Esculentia</i>]
<p>
This highly prized mushroom grows in Europe and some parts of North 
America. It has a wide hollow stem topped with a conical sponge-like cap 
which is also hollow with very thin walls. Morels are very light in 
weight but provide a rich nut-like flavor. They are highly resistant to 
cultivation with only one year-round grower using a patented process. 
The rest are harvested in season and tend to be expensive when available. 
They are also available dry but the flavor is different. Fresh ones keep 
around 10 days refrigerated in a paper bag.<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Nameko</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_nameko02d.jpg" alt="Pickled Namekos" class=mrg>
[Butterscotch Mushroom, <i>Pholiota nameko</i>]
<p>
Much appreciated in Japan, this mushroom is very difficult to find fresh 
in North America, but can be found canned in some Asian markets. Fresh 
Namekos have a slippery gelatinous coating on the cap, which may be a 
turn-off to some, but is appreciated by others. When canned this coating 
becomes part of the canning liquid which will be gelatinous to a greater 
or lesser extent depending on processing.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased pickled in an 880 ml jar. The 
largest was 3/4 inch across the cap and 1-3/4 inches long, but they do 
grow to as large as 1-1/2 inches across the cap. The average weight of

<p>
Considered by some the "king of mushrooms", the boulet has a dome shaped 
cap ranging from tan to reddish brown with a sponge like underside 
rather than gills. The stem is thick and white to yellow. Fresh porcini 
can be ordered on-line, but must be shipped express because they are 
rather perishable.</p>
<p>Dried Porcini are becoming fairly common in U.S. groceries, but at 
about $5.00 per ounce and up. I buy mine for 2016 US $1.75 per ounce 
in an 8 ounce package from Nuts.com. The soaking liquid is very fragrant 
with good mushroom flavor, and so is the flesh, but it becomes very 
mushy, so depend on these for flavor, not texture.

Originally found in northeastern North America, this mushroom has 
also been found in California, Brazil, Taiwan, Philippines and in some 
regions of Western Europe. Unfortunately, its widespread discovery has 
resulted in a whole pile of wrong scientific names, with <i>A.blazei</i> 
most common in the health food industry.</p>
<p>This is an excellent eating mushroom, somewhat sweet with a scent and 
taste of almonds. While grown in northwest U.S. and exported from Brazil 
and China, demand is so high for its medicinal properties few are available 
for eating. It is noted as a stimulant for the immune system and as a 
treatment of diabetes and radiation exposure (so it's very popular in 
Japan right now). &nbsp; <small>Photo by Nathan Wilson distributed under

<img src="img/fu_shiitaki01d.jpg" alt="Whole Fresh and Dried Shiitakes" class=mrg></a>
[Chinese, Black or Forest Mushroom, Oak Mushroom; Hed Horm (Thai); 
<i>Lentinus edodes</i>]
<p>
Varying from tan to dark brown, Shiitakes, both fresh and dried are 
almost always used cooked. They are much tougher than 
<a href="fungus.html#crimi">Criminis</a> and have a more intense mushroom flavor. 
Dried they run from 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter and weigh 7 to 10 to 
the ounce. Fresh they run from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 inches in diameter and 
weigh 3 to 5 to the ounce. Of the photo specimens the 
three on the left are fresh and the two on the right are dried.</p>
<p>Dried Shiitakes are generally sold as "dried black mushroom" or 
"dried forest mushroom". In any case they are easily identifiable due to 
the texture of the top of the cap. One ounce, soaked and wring out will 
weigh about 4 ounces. Fresh shiitakes are now produced in large quantity 
in several areas of the U.S. and are ever easier to find.  In many 
East Asian markets a special grade of dried shiitakes that is very light 
in color with deep crackling on the top surface is sold at very high 
prices, often in windowed gift boxes. Shiitakes, along with some other 
mushrooms have been found to have significant antitumor and antivirus 
properties.

<h2>Silky Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_silky03d.jpg" alt="Dried Silky Mushrooms" class=mrg>
The grower calls these "Silky Mushroom" to describe the texture when 
cooked. This name is suboptimal, because the name is also in use for 
another "Silky Mushroom". The texture and flavor of that one is not well 
described because persons who sampled them were too distracted by the 
business of dying to provide a coherent report. These are not fatal, 
and may, in fact, be dried Namekos. They are from north eastern China 
and were obtained from a large Asian market in Los Angeles.
<p>The soaking liquid is light in color with good mushroom flavor. The 
stems are relatively tender, and the heads have a silky texture similar 
to that of properly soaked fresh shiitakes, but the flavor is much 
lighter, with a hint of white mushroom flavor. These are good for 
inclusion in lighter soups and the like.

<i>Dictyophora indusiata</i>]
<p>
Stinkhorn is available dried in well stocked Oriental groceries. They 
look very unpromising as nearly weightless papery shreds, but they 
rehydrate into a mesh stem with an ethereal floating veil. Rehydrate 
them by soaking in lightly salted water for 20 minutes, then in boiling 
water for 1 minute.</p>
<p>They have just a little earthy flavor of their own but a delicate 
crunchy texture that holds up well to cooking, and the mesh structure 
holds light sauces and broth flavors extremely well. Use them in soups, 
stews and other light liquidy dishes where they are attractively 
suspended (the photo specimens are floating in water) and they'll 
add substance and texture. Nutritionally they are high in fiber and 
amino acids.

[Thai straw mushroom, Paddy Straw Mushroom; Nam rom (Viet); 
<i>Volvariella volvacea</i>]
<p>
These are grown on rice straw and are not yet widely available fresh even 
in California. They are, however, available canned in stores catering to 
Asian communities. &nbsp; <u>Caution</u> &nbsp; Mistaking the almost 
identical but highly toxic death cap (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>) for 
straw mushrooms has resulted in death and/or need for liver transplants 
among Asian immigrants to the US and Australia.</p>
<p>Straw mushrooms are canned in two forms: egg shaped with the cap and 
stem still completely encapsulated by a shroud called the volva, or partially 
opened with a conical cap on a short thick stem. These are called "unpeeled" 
and "peeled" on the can but the "peeled" is just a more mature form of the 
"unpeeled". The unpeeled can be much larger than the one in the photo. 
They are also available dried (right in photo) but not so commonly. Straw 
Mushrooms are very important in Southeast Asian cuisines, particularly Thai. 
In Vietnam they may be found growing wild on old termite mounds. These are 
much stronger in flavor than cultivated and fetch a much higher price.

the underside of the cap has pores rather than gills. A light flavored

<h2>Tea Tree Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_vspl03d.jpg" alt="Dried Tea Tree Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[Willow Mushroom; <i>Agrocybe</i>]
<p>
The Chinese guy behind me in the check-out line called these "Very 
special mushroom", which was a lot more information than the package 
provided. I was able to identify them from Chinese food and mushroom 
grower sites. These mushrooms have very long stems, to 6 inches, and 
thin caps to 2 inches diameter. A 3-1/2 ounce package was US $4.19, not 
bad compared to the price of European dried mushrooms around here.</p>
<p>"Very Special Mushroom" is an apt description. Soaking liquid is medium 
color with very good mushroom flavor. Stems are only moderately tough, 
though you'd probably want to chop them fairly small. Cooked, both the 
soaking liquid and the mushrooms have a unique sweetness. The caps are 
tender but not mushy. Certainly one of the best dried mushrooms you can 
buy.

<h2>Toriashi Mushroom</h2>

<p>
These are quite common in Asian markets in Los Angeles, generally 
produced in Taiwan but also mainland China. There are many exporter 
listings on the Internet but they were not easy to identify beyond the 
name "toriashi". I have now pretty much identified them as Shaggy Inkcap 
at a very immature stage. <i>Coprinus comatus</i> is known to be grown 
commercially in China. At later stages these mushrooms are much larger 
and extremely perishable, quickly disintegrating into black mush.</p>
<p> Toriashis are available canned and are pretty much 
interchangeable with straw mushrooms, except a little milder, and they 
need to be cut differently because they are a little firmer and more 
elongated. The largest of the photo specimens was 2.75 inches long, 
0.9 inches diameter at the stem end and weighed 0.63 ounce.

<p>
Truffles, black, white or whatever, are the fruiting bodies of 
fungi related to Morels and Cup Fungi. They have long been a hallmark of 
gourmet cuisine, but the most desirable species have become scarce and 
exceedingly expensive. Efforts to cultivate them continue with mixed 
success. The basic problem is that truffles live in a symbiotic 
relationship with the roots of living trees, of a particular species, 
and can't be grown without the trees. Trees take up a lot of room, so 
yield per acre is low. There are so many different truffles, they  now 
have their own <a href="fu_truffle.html"><b>Truffles</b></a> page.

<h2>Turkey Tail Mushroom</h2>
<br><img src="img/fu_turtail01e.jpg" alt="Growing Turkey Tail Mushrooms" class=mrg>
[<i>Trametes versicolor</i>]
<p>
This mushroom is found worldwide and appears in many colors. It is a 
polypore mushroom, meaning its bottom side is smooth rather than gilled, 
and has many pores through which the spores are released.  Mature examples 
are around 3 x 2 inches and about 1/4 inch thick near the center. It is 
kind of leathery, and, though eaten, is not really considered to be a 
culinary mushroom.</p>
<p>Health properties of this mushroom have been most appreciated in 
Japan, used mainly to strengthen the immune system. It is now being 
promoted in North America as a "super-food". Generally powdered mushroom 
is added to juices and shakes. This mushroom has also been promoted as a 
cancer treatment, but evidence so far is that whole fresh mushrooms are 
not effective. Extracts, particularly of Polysaccharide-K (PSK) may have 
some value in treating some cancers and suppressing recurrence.

<p>
This fungus is very much like the <a href="fungus.html#black">Black Fungus</a> except 
it is white. Once very expensive it is now farmed and quite common in 
Asian markets. While most fungi break down plant material for food, this 
one is actually a parasite on another fungus. As you can see from the 
photo specimens, which were the same size dry, this fungus doesn't expand 
anywhere near as much as the Black Fungus and has a tighter structure. 
They have almost no flavor but are delicately crunchy, a little less so 
than the Black Fungus, and absorb flavors well. The soaked specimen is 
4-1/2 inches across.

<p>
This common mushroom is not particularly interesting from a flavor 
standpoint, but, unlike some other mushrooms, it works well raw in 
salads. It is easy and economical to grow in commercial quantity. It 
was, in fact, the first mushroom cultivated in quantity, with production 
started in limestone quarries outside Paris in the 18th century.</p>

<p>They will keep up to 7 days refrigerated in a paper bag, but darken 
and start to shrivel. They will become slimy and rot within hours if 
kept in plastic. The photo specimens are around 2 inches across, fairly 
typical, but they are also sold somewhat larger and quite a bit smaller. 
Very fresh ones 2-1/4 inches across weigh about 1.25 ounces each, and 
smaller ones, around 1-1/2 inches across, weigh about 1 ounce each. 
Both will lose water (and weight) rapidly. Even smaller ones are 
available canned. <a href="fungus.html#crimi"><b>Crimini</b></a> are a brown

<p>
These prized eating mushrooms are native to North America and Europe, 
and have been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. They can grow to 
nearly 9 inches high and nearly 12 inches across when the cap is fully 
opened, but the photo specimens were harvested very young and pickled. 
The largest was 3-1/4 inches long, 1-3/8 inches across the cap and with 
a 7/8 inch thick stem. Fresh, the stems would be white with a wrinkled 
ring around them, and the caps reddish brown on top. The gills turn 
from pale to dark purple-brown as they mature. This fungus is considered 
excellent for companion planting, particularly with corn. It is able 
to paralize and digest some nematodes.

<h2 class=lrg id="yeast">Yeast</h2>
<br>[found in divisions <i>Ascomycota</i> and <i>Basidlomycota</i>]
<br>Like mold, yeast is a term of convenience rather than a precise 
scientific definition. Unlike mushrooms and molds, yeasts are mainly 
single cells, though some may string together. They reproduce mainly by 
budding or division, but under some conditions can produce spores. 
Yeasts, particularly <i>Saccharomyces</i>, are of great importance in 
the brewing beer, baking of bread, and fermenting of grapes into wine. 
Yeast fermentation is also the first step in making vinegar, followed 
by a bacterial fermentation which turns alcohol into acetic acid.
<p>The low temperature yeast used to brew lager beer has long been a 
mystery. It was clearly a hybrid of an ale yeast and something else, 
but the "something else" could not be found in the wild in Europe. It 
was finally found (99.5% DNA match) in sweet galls on beech trees in 
Patagonia (southern Argentina). The question as to how a Patagonian 
yeast got to Bohemia well before Columbus' first voyage did not have 
to be answered. By 2014 it had been found wild in Tibet, Mongolia and 
parts of China.

   vegans are major customers, this product is often heavily fortified 
   with B vitmins, including a form of vitamin B12 produced artificially 
   by bacteria (in nature, found in adequate concentration only from 
   animal sources). This form (Cyanocobalamin) is not directly usable, 
   but can be converted to a usable form in the body by releasing the 
   cyanide. Vitamin B12 is essential to brain and nervous system function

   coloring (it is much more intense than the photo when wet), flavoring 
   and medicinal. It is also used in Japan and Southeast Asia, including 
   Indonesia. This yeast contains monacolin K, also known as the statin 
   drug Lovastatin. Consumer Reports and others have presumed it has the 
   same side effects as statin drugs. This is not likely, as  the strains 
   used to produce dietary supplements in the United States are very 
   low in monacolin K. The form usually sold is dried and ground, 
   including the rice substrate.</p>
   <p>As always in the "health food" industry, there are cheaters, some 
   having been found to spike their red yeast rice with lovastatin. 
   Some brands have been found to contain the toxin Citrinin, found in 
   poorly stored grains. For these reasons it is important to select a 
   reputable source - or produce you own, which is easy once you get 
   some live yeast as a supplement. Culinary use is occasional and in 
   very small quantity, so should not be a problem. Red Yeast Rice

[found in divisions <i>Zygomycota</i>, <i>Deuteromycota</i> and 
<i>Ascomycota</i>]
<p>"Mold" is a definition of convenience rather than anything precise 
and scientific, and there are thousands of known species. Like mushrooms, 
molds grow in filaments and reproduce by releasing spores. While they 
are major spoilers of food, they are also useful, particularly in the 
maturing of cheeses and sausages, fermentation of soy products and 
production of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. The photo shows 
Gorgonzola cheese with blue mold and Italian dry salami with a coating 
of white mold.</p>
<p>Some molds are highly toxic and others generate allergies, so moldy 
food should not be eaten unless it is a traditional mold enhance product 
or one known safe with the mold scraped off (jams are a traditional 
example). General exposure to molds, particularly respiratory exposure, 
should be avoided as numerous health problems can follow.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<br>

<h3>Toxicity:</h3> &nbsp; Many fungi are highly toxic, including many 
reputed to have psychoactive properties. Extreme caution must be 
exercised, and any fungus that is not positively identified should 
not be consumed in any form. In at least one case, Coprinus, the mushroom 
is safe but it renders alcohol highly toxic. Commercially grown mushrooms 
do not contain dangerous levels of toxins.<p></p>

<h3>Benzine & Hydrazine:</h3> &nbsp; Raw white mushrooms are known to 
contain some amount of benzine and hydrazines, both known carcinogens. 
Hydrazines can survive even extended cooking. These mushrooms also 
contain other compounds, including antioxidants, which suppress tumor 
formation and growth (<a href="fungus.html#f03">3</a>). The total impact on health 
is unknown but in general even raw white mushrooms are considered safe 
in commonly consumed amounts.<p></p>

<h3>Vitamin D:</h3> &nbsp; Mushrooms are pretty much the only 
non-animal source for vitamin D - unless you lump them in with animals 
as we do here. The importance of vitamin D has been greatly emphasized 
by recent research, and most people are reported to be deficient in this 
critical nutrient. It has recently been found that even short exposure 
to ultraviolet light greatly increases the vitamin D content in 
mushrooms, whether applied before or after harvest. It does, however, 
cause white mushrooms to be browner, more like crimini mushrooms. This 
is the same as when you expose yourself to the sun's ultraviolet 
radiation, you get browner and vitamin D is generated. The mushroom 
industry is, of course, planning to market "D enhanced" mushrooms.

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; White mushrooms (and presumably others) 
are a good source for copper, potassium, selenium and the B-vitamins 
niacin, pantothenic acid and riboflavin. They also contain a powerful 
antioxidant, ergothioneine, in greater quantity than in the next best 
sources, chicken livers and wheat germ. Mushrooms are very low in 
calories and are fat and cholesterol free (<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/f04">4</a>).
<p></p>

<h3>Pharmaceuticals:</h3> &nbsp; Many varieties of mushroom are 
currently under intensive study. Various properties, depending on 
variety, are antiviral, antibacterial, antitumor, immune system 
enhancement, athletic enhancement, cholesterol control and reducing 
insulin resistance for diabetics. Clovegarden is a culinary site, 
so we do not detail medicinal information here.<p></p>
