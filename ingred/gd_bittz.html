<p>
Actually a gourd, not a mellon, this is one of the most bitter of edible 
vegetables, the bitterness coming from a substance called momordicin, 
which is similar to quinine. Bitter Melon is reputed for many beneficial 
medicinal properties, particularly for treatment of diabetes, but all 
need further study.</p> 
<p>Aside from the bitterness, the flavor of this gourd is very 
interesting, and it is popular throughout India, Nepal, China and 
Southeast Asia. While long popular in Okinawa, this gourd has recently 
gained popularity on the main islands of Japan. People are using the 
vines to shade the sun side of their homes, and the gourds are available 
in markets during the Summer, for use in Okinawa style dishes.</p>
<p>Bitter Melon is now also grown in Africa, the Caribbean, and of course 
California. The Chinese variety is always in very good supply here in 
Los Angeles, and the Indian varieties are increasingly available.</p>
<p>The gourds are generally eaten quite green when the seed mass will be 
white. As the gourd ripens fully it turns yellowish, very bitter and less 
crisp. The pulpy arils surrounding the seeds become brilliant red and 
quite sweet. They are popular in salads in Southeast Asia but at this 
point the rest of the melon is of little use.</p>
<p>The melon at the top in the photo is the common Chinese variety, while 
the other three are the Indian variety. White versions of the Indian type 
also exist but are not much seen around here. Miniature Indian varieties 
are popular in India and Southeast Asia for stuffing as individual 
portions.</p>

<p>
In parts of Asia, developing a taste for bitter melon is part of the 
passage from childhood to adulthood, though even there many recipes have 
some step in them that's a largely futile attempt to reduce the 
bitterness.</p>
<p>While I enjoy a bitter melon dish now and then, I wouldn't serve one 
to guests without notice - most Americans aren't accustomed to bitter 
flavors - they even adulterate their coffee with cream (suspected of 
destroying the health benefits of coffee). I often just seed a melon, 
slice it about 1/4 inch thick, salt the slices heavily and let them sit 
an hour. I rinse the slices and eat them as a low calorie salty 
snack.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The darker green the color the better as they 
get increasingly bitter and less crisp as they mature. If they are 
yellowish they are useful only for the brilliant red arils surrounding 
the seeds. For use as a vegetable the seed mass should have no more than 
a faint pink blush surrounding the seeds. Select fresh looking fruit 
without soft spots or blemishes. The Indian type tends to get black spots 
where the points have been damaged. This indicates they aren't very fresh.

<p>Different varieties have different degrees of bitterness. The Indian 
type is the most bitter. I occasionally find a long narrow dark green 
Chinese variety that's a little milder than most. The very large Taiwan 
variety pictured at the left may be a little too mild. It might be a good 
"starter melon" if it weren't so rare.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These gourds are quite perishable, the Indian 
varieties more so because their pointy skin is more prone to damage. In 
either case they should be kept refrigerated, preferably wrapped in paper 
rather than plastic and for a few days at most.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Generally cut off the ends, split the gourd 
lengthwise and scrape out the seed mass with a spoon. In cases where 
they are stuffed, they are often cut into lengths of about 1-1/4 inch 
and the seed mass is pushed out. The cylinders are stuffed and set on 
end for serving. The skins are thin and they are very rarely peeled.

<p> After cutting, many recipes call for either salting the pieces, then 
rinsing, or parboiling. These procedures are supposed to reduce the 
bitterness but aren't really very effective, and parboiling is thought 
to reduce the beneficial medicinal value.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Bitter melons are most often used in soups and 
stir fries or stuffed. For stir fries do parboil the melon slices in 
boiling water for about 3 minutes so they need be stir fried for only a 
minute or two.<p></p>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2> &nbsp; Bitter Melon 
tastes bitter and medicinal, so it's got to be good for you, right? These 
gourds and their leaves are considered highly medicinal, particularly 
effective against type 2 diabetes, but also against cancer, HIV and 
hemorrhoids. These effects have neither been proven nor disproven by 
scientific investigation. This is an inexpensive, commonly available 
plant, usable as-is, so pharmaceutical companies are totally uninterested 
in sponsoring major studies. Smaller studies have tended to support 
bitter melon's reputed benefits.<p></p>

<p>While bitter melon does not contain quinine, it has been found to have 
similar anti-malarial properties. Anti-viral and antioxidant properties 
are also suspected. Bitter melon is high in minerals and vitamin B, but 
how much is in a form the body can absorb is not known - again, nobody 
is interested in sponsoring research on something they cant patent.</p>

<p>There are also negative effects. An overdose in small children can 
cause hypoglycemic coma, for the same reason it's good against diabetes 
- lowering blood sugar. It is also reported able to cause headaches, 
though I haven't noticed such an effect.</p>
