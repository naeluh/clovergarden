This gourd is native to southeast Nigeria and is cultivated mainly by 
the Igbo people. The fruit is inedible, but the seeds are very important 
for protein and oil, and the leaves are used as a common vegetable. 
The plant and seeds are also used in traditional medicine. It is 
normally grown on trellises, but can be intercropped on the ground 
around tall plants like corn, and especially with trees.

<p>The fruit is large, from 6 to 41 inches long and weigh up to 22 
pounds. A single fruit can have as many as 200 seeds, which can be 
nearly 2 inches long. They contain about 30% oil and 27% protein. 
The seeds can be cooked and eaten whole, or ground and fermented for 
use as a flavoring condiment (Ogiri). they are also ground to flour 
for use in baked goods.</p>

<p>The leaves are chopped and used in various soups and stews. 
They are very rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, and are 
antimicrobial and protective to the liver. They quickly lose nutritional 
value so should be bagged in plastic and refrigerated, to be cooked as 
soon as possible.</p>

<p><b><u>Caution</u>:</b> &nbsp; In Nigeria this vegetable is called 
just "Pumpkin". They have some other vegetable with hollow flute-like 
stems they call "Fluted Pumpkin", but that usage seems to be fading. 
Most articles for Nigerian Fluted Pumpkin now refer to 
<i>Telfairia occidentalis</i>, but just plain "Pumpkin" also still 
refers to <i>T. occidentalis</i>. I have seen recipes including 
"Sliced Fluted Pumpkin" but sources specific to <i>T. occidentalis</i> 
say that fruit is inedible, so I presume this is the old usage.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Currently dried leaves are available on the 
Internet, but in Nigeria they are only used fresh, losing nutritional 
value quickly off the plant. Seeds, even for planting, are completely 
unavailable in North America (June 2018). There is now a company in 
Florida selling fresh leaves, so the situation may improve.
</p>

<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; Regular Western Spinach is considered the 
best substitute for these very tender leaves.</p>
