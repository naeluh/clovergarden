A variety of the large to gigantic <a href="gd_ashz.html">
<b>Ash Gourd</b></a> that's picked and eaten at a much earlier stage of 
growth. In this stage it's covered with short bristles, thus the name, 
but by time I get them home most have rubbed off. Many recipes say to 
peel them, but you'll have more flavor and more melon if you just scrape 
them, just taking the dark green skin.</p>
<p>Asian recipes usually presume they are about 1/2 pound, but here in 
Los Angeles they run from 3/4 pound to a shade over 2 pounds. The photo 
specimen was 9 inches long, 3 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 9 ounces. 
The lower photo shows the same melons along with a mature Winter Melon 
(a very small one).</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Large numbers of Fuzzy Melons are now grown in 
California so they're easy to find in markets serving Southeast Asian, 
Chinese and Indian communities. Look for nice bright melons, heavy for their 
size, and without soft or discolored spots. Melons weighing 1 pound are good, 
but I haven't seen much difference up to 2 pounds. Asian recipes usually 
presume long melons weighing about 1/2 pound. <p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Whole gourds, if in good condition, have lasted 
some days just sitting on my kitchen floor, but loosely bagged in the 
refrigerator they should last a couple of weeks if undamaged. Once cut they 
will keep refrigerated for less than a week.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for peeling, but a better plan is 
to just scrape off the outer dark green fuzzy skin with the back edge of 
your prep knife. This gives you more flavor and more melon for your money.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fuzzy melon is used in soups and stir fries, and 
in India in curries. It is very tender and delicate but, as with other gourds, 
chunks hold their shape well compared to squash. Most recipes call for 
cooking for about 5 minutes, but this varies - cook until the slices are 
mostly translucent.
