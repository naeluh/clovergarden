[Spiny Gourd, Teasle gourd; Kankada, Bhat-kerela, Kakrul, Ghi korola,

Erumapaval (India); <i>Momordica dioica</i>]
<p>
This gourd is used as a vegetable all over India and in some parts 
of Southeast Asia, thus the many names. Usage is similar to Karala 
(Indian Bitter Melon), but, though Its flavor is similar to karala, 
it has only a faint hint of the bitterness. It is commonly fried with 
spices and often served with meats or fish. This gourd also has 
medicinal uses. </p>
<p>The photo specimens were of varying size, the largest being 
1.6 inches long, 1.1 inch diameter and weighing 3/8 ounce. a batch 
of 16 averaged 0.25 ounces each. The specimen at the upper right is 
a bit ripe for cooking, but still edible. When fully ripe, the rinds 
get dry, and they split wide open to expose the seeds and the 
sweet, pulpy, bright red arils that surround them.</p>

<p>These are a good tasting vegetable, but the seeds will always be at 
least a little crunchy. How crunchy depends on how ripe they are - but 
they are not seeded. The cross section in the photo above shows the 
most ripe condition that should be cooked.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found these in an Indian market in 
Los Angeles (Artesia) in October. They seem a bit small, but are 
entirely usable. They were purchased for 2016 US $6.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely bagged, they will keep in the fridge 
for about a week.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; just cut a tiny bit off each end, then slice. 
they are usually sliced lengthwise into 6, 4 or 2 wedges depending 
on size.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Wedges of kantola cook in about the same 
time as similarly sized pieces of potato, and the two are often 
cooked together.<p></p> 

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; There is little waste, so yield is nearly 
100%.<p></p>
