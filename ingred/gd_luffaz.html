<h1>Luffa Gourds</h1>
<p>All these gourds are of family <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>, thus close 
relatives of the Cucumbers, Squash, Melons, but their cooking properties 
are different from all the rest of the family except some other goards, 
like the Bottle Gourd.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Angled Luffa</h2>
<br><img src="img/gd_luffaa11g.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Angled Luffa" class=mrg>
[Chinese Okra, Vine Okra, California Okra; Patola (Philippine); Muop Khia 
(Viet); Buap Liyam (Thai); Turai, Torai, Dodka, Jhinga (India); Sigua, 
Sing Qua (China); Oyong (Indonesia); <i>Luffa acutangula</i>]
<p>
   Grown all over Southeast Asia, these have also long been a common vegetable 
   here in Southern California. They are used by Asians of all stripes, from 
   India to the Philippines. Often sold as "Chinese Okra", it is entirely 
   unrelated to Okra and does not resemble it in flavor, texture, cooking 
   properties or size, only in that it has ridges.</p>
   <p>The skin is stiff and thin with sharp ridges running the full length. 
   The flesh is very delicate in both flavor and texture, yet holds its shape 
   well when cooked. The photo specimen was 19 inches long, 2-1/2 inches 
   diameter and weighed 14 ounces. They vary in shape and size. The cut one 
   was more uniform in diameter, 21 inches long and weighed just over 1 
   pound. </p>

<h2 class=lrg>Smooth Luffa</h2>
<br><img src="img/gd_luffas02f.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Smooth Luffa" class=mrg>
     [Egyptian Luffa, Silk Gourd, Vietnamese Lufa; Patola (Philippine); 
     Muop Huong, Totura Muop (Vietnam); Galka, Gilki, Ghosavala (India); 
     Sigua, Sing Qua (China); Oyong (Indonesia); <i>Luffa cylindrica</i> 
     alt <i>L. aegyptiaca</i>] 
<p>
   Probably of African origin, these are an eating variety which may be 
   cylindrical or snake shaped with little or no ridging. Cylindrical ones 
   are generally eaten when they are about 8 to 10 inches long, snake 
   shaped ones depending on variety. The photo specimen in the center was 
   11 inches long and 2-1/2 inches diameter.</p>
   <p>These gourds have not yet become common in Southern California 
   markets, but I have found them in Indian markets in Artesia and some 
   Asian markets in San Gabriel. They have a more distinctly vegetable 
   flavor than the Angled Luffa and store considerably longer. In 
   California they are grown commercially, mostly for the bath sponge 
   produced when they mature and dry out. They are also grown in Florida 
   where some may be used for cooking.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Taiwan Luffa</h2>

[Sweet Cee Gua;  Taiwan squash; <i>Luffa cylindrica</i> alt <i>L. aegyptiaca</i>]
<p>
   In Taiwan, a number of luffa varieties have been developed that are 
   short and blocky. The photo specimens are the most extreme - most 
   Taiwan varieties are narrower (2-1/2 to 3 inches diameter) and 
   at least twice as long as wide. These specimens were 5 inches long, 
   4-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound each. My most recent 
   purchase was from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) 
   for 2018 US $1.29 / pound, labeled as "Sweet Cee Gua". They seem 
   to be most available in October-November.</p>

<h2>All Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The angled variety is not new around here, having 
been grown in California for many decades. The smooth variety is still not 
too common - I don't know why, it's easier to work with than the angled 
variety. Find smooth luffa in Asian or Indian markets. Angled luffa can 
also be found in produce markets and some well stocked supermarkets, 
especially in areas with a significant Asian population. Look for gourds 
fairly thick for their length and without soft spots indicating 
spoilage.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Angled Luffa will keep a couple days at room 
temperature and up to a week wrapped in paper in the refrigerator. They 
rot quickly if the skin is moist so don't keep in plastic. The smooth 
variety keeps a bit better in the fridge.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Peel the skin with a vegetable peeler, taking 
as little as possible - The lighter green layer underneath should be 
left. For angled luffa it's easiest if you first peel off all the ridges, 
then do the spaces between.
<p>Slice or cube per the recipe (the seeds are edible). Cook gently. 
Unlike squash, they hold their shape well with cooking and do not become 
mushy.</p> 

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 14 ounce angled luffa yielded 8-3/8 ounces 
peeled (60%). Smooth luffas will yield a bit better because there is no 
no waste from the ridges.<p></p>
