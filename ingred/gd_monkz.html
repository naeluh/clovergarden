[Luo han guo (China); La han qua (Viet); longevity fruit (not unique); 
<i>Fructus Momordicae</i> (Pharm); <i>Siraitia grosvenorii</i>]
<p>
Native to southern China and northern Thailand, this gourd is related 
to the <a href="gd_bittz.html">Bitter Gourds</a>, but genus 
<i>Siraitia</i>, not <i>Momordica</i>). This fruit has recently become 
much better known in the West. Extracts from this fruit are 300 times 
sweeter than cane sugar, with almost no calories. The US FDA (Food and 
Drug Administration) has recently rated the fruit and extracts from it 
as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), so they can be included as natural 
sweeteners in any number of products. This sweetener has not yet been 
shown to have the serious negative effects of artificial sweeteners, 
but sufficient studies looking for those have yet to be conducted.</p>

<p>The fruits grow on vines, and are between 2 to 2-3/4 inches diameter 
with sweet, fleshy edible pulp and many seeds. Monk Fruit is a rather 
finicky grower, rarely found in the wild, but techniques for cultivation 
have been well developed in a few places in southern China. This fruit 
has long been used medicinally to treat heatstroke, throat infections 
and diabetes, but is not mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine 
because it doesn't grow near central China. It is not used fresh as it 
doesn't keep well and has objectional aromas and flavors. It is generally 
oven dried, after which it has different objectional tastes and aromas. 
Modern processing techniques are capable of removing these. After 
drying, the shell is very hard, but also very thin and brittle, while 
the pulp becomes soft and powdery.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Here in Southern California, the big Asian 
supermarkets devote at least one side of a long isle to "medicinals". 
Whole dried Monkfruits can be found there, carefully packed in fitted 
plastic clamshells, three to a bag. The photo specimens were purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US 
$1.99 for 3 pieces (2 ounces). Product of China. The dried form can 
also be found in Chinese Herbal shops, and supplement tablets can be 
found in the usual "Health Food" outlets.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The dried fruit is usually steeped in hot water 
along with other herbals to make tonic teas, particularly for sore throat 
and heatstroke, or for use in tonic soups.<p></p>
