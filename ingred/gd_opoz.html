Probably originating in southern Africa, this gourd was one of the 
earliest plants to enter cultivation, probably more for containers than 
for food. Genetic analysis has shown they were carried from Asia to the 
Americas more than 8000 years ago.</p>

<p>Bottle gourds come in many shapes and sizes from long and snake like 
to spherical, but the form pictured is the one most common in Southern 
California. They will grow much larger but they get very bitter when 
more mature. Eventually the shell hardens and the gourd becomes hollow 
and may be used as a container or utensil, or carved decoratively. 
Young shoots and leaves are also edible. Dried strips of the 
gourd called Kampyo are important in Japan and often used as edible 
bindings to hold other ingredients together. The photo specimen was 12 
inches long, 3-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 2-1/2 pounds, a touch 
above average for those sold in Southern California. </p>

Spherical opo gourds like the one in the photo to the left have started 
appearing in produce markets here in Los Angeles (2012). Some of these 
have a small neck at the stem end. The photo specimen was 4.5 inches 
diameter, and weighed 1 pound 1 ounces. the cut one was a little heavier 
at 1 pound 3 ounces. The cut version has a faintly visible seed (upper 
left), slightly beige in color, indicating this gourd is at maximum 
maturity for eating. The seeds of this variety are fairly large, due 
to it's large diameter. All characteristics except shape are the same 
for long and spherical Opos.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find these in Asian and other ethnic markets and at 
many well stocked supermarkets (in California, anyway).  In Indian 
markets the spherical ones may be sold as "Indian Opo", but in other 
markets they are just "Opo".<p></p>

<h3>Store:</h3> &nbsp; They will be fine over a week unwrapped in the 
refrigerator, protected by their waxy coating. In fact, they last that 
long just sitting on my kitchen floor, but unrefrigerated the seeds may 
continue to mature, making them undesirable for cooking. Once cut, 
they spoil rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The peel is tender and very thin so do a minimum 
peel with a vegetable peeler. Many recipes call for scooping out the 
seed mass, but this is wasteful and unneeded, unless the gourd is 
over-aged and the seeds are darkening.<p></p>

<h3>Cook:</h3> &nbsp;  Like other gourds they hold their shape very well 
in cooking rather than becoming mush like squash do. They are done when 
the flesh is translucent (about 10 to 15 minutes depending on maturity 
and size of chunks). Best to pull before the seed mass starts to break 
up.<p></p>
