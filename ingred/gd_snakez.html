[Serpent Gourd, Chichinga, Padwal, <i>Trichosanthes cucumerina </i> var 
<i>anguina</i>]
<p>
This gourd is popular in Southern India and Southeast Asia. It comes in 
various colors, sizes and shapes, growing to as long as 6 feet, and in Asia 
is often seen with a rock tied to the tip to keep it growing straight. Shoots 
and leaves are also eaten as a vegetable.</p>
<p>The flesh of this gourd is similar to the <a href="gd_luffaz.html">
<b>Luffa</b></a> and <a href="gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a>, 
and like them will hold its shape when cooked. Unlike the other two, the 
seed mass of the Snake Gourd is loose and fluffy. It is removed from all 
except the long 1 inch variety shown below. Snake gourd is also used in 
traditional Chinese medicine.

The Snake Gourd has a very strange flower that opens at night. In the 
photo the flower is still unfurling so it looks disorderly but it will open 
to 5 lacy petals.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are still a "hit or miss" item here in Los 
Angeles, so you buy them when you can get them. They are most often found in 
Indian markets and can cost as much as US $2.99 / pound there. When they 
show up in one of the regular produce markets they can be as low as $0.79 / 
pound. They are very light weight.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Snake gourds have very thin skins and are rarely 
peeled. The seed mass is very loose and spongy, generally removed (except 
perhaps in the thin snaky ones shown below). There are recipes that use 
the seed mass separately from the gourds. Like other gourds, and unlike 
squash, the flesh becomes tender with cooking but does not become mushy, 
holding its shape well.<p></p>

Here are some really snaky ones from a local Indian market in Los Angeles, 
purchased in early 2010. The longest was 33-1/2 inches long, 1.1 inches 
diameter and weighed 8 ounces.

Here's yet another variety from the same Indian market about 2 years earlier. 
These were about 20 inches long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 
4 ounces. Green and white striped ones as shown in the heading photo are 
also common here.
