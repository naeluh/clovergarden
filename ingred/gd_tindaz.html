Native to India, this gourd is popular in the cuisines of Northern India 
and Pakistan.  The gourd is most often eaten in an immature stage when it 
will be tender and needs neither peeling nor seeding. More mature tinda 
will have a tough skin and hard seeds, both of which need to be removed. 
Seeds of fully mature gourds are eaten. The largest of the photo 
specimens was 3.3 inches diameter and weighed 8-3/8 ounces.</p>

<p>Tinda is considered a very beneficial vegetable, especially for various 
digestive issues. It is often considered a bit uninteresting, so is 
usually included in dishes that are fairly highly spiced. In India, 
Tinda is reputed to be absolutely hated by children, but loved by them 
when they become adults.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This gourd is becoming more common in Southern 
California when it is in season. When in seasons, it can be found in 
markets serving a significant Indian / Pakistani community. The photo 
specimens were bought in early July from a large multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $1.39 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The taste and cooking properties of Bottle Gourd 
(Opo) are very similar. These are larger and usually need to be peeled. 
The seeds are larger but tender if the gourd is as young as it should 
be. Opo will cook in a shorter time than Tinda.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; As sold here in Southern California, these usually 
need only be cut to size, discarding just a little at the flower and 
stem ends. They need not be peeled - the peel will be noticeable but 
not annoying. If in doubt, you can use a vegetable peeler to remove 
the minimum thickness of skin. If you find hard white or black seeds, 
they must be scraped out. Gourds that mature probably should be peeled 
as well.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The raw flesh of this gourd is rather hard, 
and it takes longer cooking than most gourds do - simmering for 45 
to 55 minutes.<p></p>
