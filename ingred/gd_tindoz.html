A popular vegetable in India, this tiny gourd can now be found in Indian 
markets in California and elsewhere. Here it is always sold green, looking 
very much like a tiny cucumber, but in India it is also sometimes used in 
it's scarlet red mature stage.</p>
<p>Tindora can be eaten raw and are a lot more crunchy than cucumbers, or they 
may be cooked as a side dish or may be pickled. When pickled they are  
sometimes called "gherkin" but are easy to tell from the real 
<a href="ck_gherkz.html">Gherkin</a> and from cucumber gherkins by 
their smooth skin. Typically they are between 2-1/2 and 3-1/4 inches long, 
3/4 to 7/8 inch diameter and weigh around 5/8 ounce.

<p>In parts of India folklore holds that eating red ripe tindora causes 
brain death but they are eaten that way in other parts by people who 
don't seem to suffer premature dementia. In California they are always 
sold in the much more popular green stage. If you want red ones you need 
to grow your own vines, which I understand is very easy to do - they 
grow like weeds and are in fact listed as weeds in Texas and Florida 
and "noxious weeds" in Hawaii. They are said to be quite sour when fully 
ripe.</p>
<p>Aside from being cooked alone they can be combined with other vegetables 
or can be used in salads as cucumber would be, or just serve them whole as 
refreshing munchies.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Find these in some Indian markets. Of the cluster 
of 5 Indian markets on Pioneer in Artesia only one has them regularly but 
I've heard they are available in Chicago also. Look for dark green gourds 
between 2-1/2 and 3-1/4 inches long, firm and without dark spots or 
yellowing at the ends.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These are fairly perishable. keep them in a paper 
bag in the fridge and use them within a week.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; They should not be overcooked and should still 
have a fair amount of their crunchiness when served. They should be 
served immdiately when finish cooking or they may loose their 
crunchiness.<p></p>
