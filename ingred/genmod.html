<h1>Genetically Modified Foods</h1>
<br><img src="img/griffin01e.jpg" alt="Griffin - a genetically modified animal" class=mrg>
<p>
Genetically Modified Crops (GM Crops) are created by splicing alien 
fragments of genetic code into the genetic code of a plant or animal to 
produce certain desired characteristics. For instance, soybean plants 
have bacterial DNA spliced in to make them resistant to the powerful 
herbicide Roundup. That bacterial DNA ends up in your food (along with 
some toxic Roundup as a bonus).</p>
<p>There are advantages to GM crops, but also problems, both known and 
unknown. Their long term effects on health and the environment are 
nearly impossible for us to know, especially because vast amounts of 
money are involved.

<p>About 75% of packaged foods you may purchase in supermarkets contain 
genetically modified material, mostly from Canola Oil, Corn and Soybeans. 
These foods are very difficult for a normal consumer to avoid. So what 
food crops are currently genetically modified in North America?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Canola Oil:</b> &nbsp; About 80% of all canola grown is GM. 
  The whole difference between <a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a> 
  (FDA approved for human consumption) and Rapeseed Oil (considered 
  toxic) is from the GM modification.</li>
<li><b>Corn:</b> &nbsp; Sweet corn (corn on the cob) and canned corn are 
  almost all non-GM, but corn for food processors (corn chips, tortillas, 
  etc.) and for animal feed generally is.</li>
<li><b>Soybeans:</b> &nbsp; About 90% of all soybeans grown in North 
  America.</li>
<li><b>Potatoes:</b> &nbsp; Some Atlantic, Russet Burbank, Russet 
  Norkatah and Shepody. Planting of GM potatoes has declined due to 
  consumer resistance.</li>
<li><b>Tomatoes:</b> &nbsp; Including cherry tomatoes - but GM tomatoes 
  are no longer planted due to consumer resistance.</li>
<li><b>Squash:</b> &nbsp; Some Yellow Crookneck, possibly some Zucchini.
  </li>
<li><b>Sugar Beets:</b> &nbsp; The courts have declared the USDA violated 
  regulations in allowing planting of this crop.</li>
<li><b>Papaya</b> &nbsp; About 50% of Papaya from Hawaii is GM. No way to 
  tell it from the non-GM. Mexican papayas are a lot bigger anyway.</li>
<li><b>Cotton:</b> &nbsp; This includes cotton seed oil used in many 
  processed foods.</li>
<li><b>Vegetable Rennet:</b> &nbsp; The non-animal coagulant used to make 
  cheese for vegetarians (and everyone else since animal rennet is in 
  short supply) is produced by genetically engineered bacteria.</li>
<li><b>Vitamin B12:</b> &nbsp; There is no significant natural non-animal 
  source for this critical vitamin. Strict vegans depend on B12 produced 
  by genetically modified bacteria.</li>
<li><b>rBGH/rBST:</b> &nbsp; This hormone, injected into cattle for 
  faster growth, is produced by genetically modified organisms. This 
  controversial substance is found in meat and possibly milk 
  (<a href="genmod.html#g14">G14</a>).</li>
<li><b>Salmon:</b> &nbsp; Not yet approved except in Canada, this very 
  fast growing Atlantic salmon is the GM animal closest to U.S. 
  approval.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Labeling</h2>

<p>Foods containing GM material must be clearly labeled in Europe.  
In 2016 a GMO labeling law was passed in the US (<a href="genmod.html#g12">G12</a>). 
This law nullified all stricter laws enacted by states. The required 
labeling is anything but clear, and can be in formats that can only be 
read by electronic equipment most consumers do not have.</p>

<p>The requirements called for by the law are extremely loose, and no 
penalties are provided for ignoring the law entirely. It is significant 
that all sponsors of this law were Republicans, and the law was 
approved by Monsanto, the major producer of Genetically Modified 
seed.<p>

<p>The only significant enforcement is FDA regulations requiring 
Certified Organic growers to keep their products GM free. Whole Foods 
Markets has partnered with a non-GMO program to certify products 
as non-GMO (through inspection, documentation and genetic testing) and 
apply a non-GMO logo to them. Chances of getting a European style label 
for products containing GM ingredients in North America is about zip. 
Too many people vote for Republicans, most of whom are totally owned by 
the agriculture cartels and other factions of the 1% (and some Democrats 
also are).</p>

<p>rBGH/rBST is an artificial bovine growth hormone produced by genetic 
engineering. Several dairy states have passed laws that forbid labeling 
dairy products as from cows NOT injected with rBGH/rBST. In Ohio this 
law has been defeated in the court of appeals, but producers are still 
required to have on no-rBGH labels a disclaimer saying "According to the 
FDA, there is no significant difference between the milk from cows 
injected with rBST compared to those not injected" - for a rather loose 
interpretation of "significant".</p>

<h2>Why Genetically Modified Crops?</h2>

<p>Crops are genetically modified to make them resistant to certain 
herbicides, diseases or insects, or to make them grow faster and larger 
or grow in climates where they normally do not do well.</p>

<p>One of Monsanto's major reasons for genetically modifying crops is to 
make them resistant to a powerful herbicide they manufacture and sell 
called Roundup. Massive doses of Roundup are sprayed on crop fields to 
kill all the weeds, leaving the GM crop untouched. The result is, of 
course, the natural development of super-weeds that eat Roundup for 
lunch. Some farms have had to resort to manual weeding - not seen in big 
agriculture for many years. Even more serious, a major study has now 
linked Roundup to birth defects (<a href="genmod.html#g11">G11</a>).</p>

<p>The USDA has done nothing about this and the predictable response of 
corporate agriculture has been to spray more herbicides, and more 
dangerous herbicides, increasing pollution of the environment and 
contamination of your food. In contrast, the FDA has maintained an 
effective program to prevent development of super-insects.</p>

<h2>Are GM Foods Safe?</h2>

<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have 
released a rather comprehensive report, after listening to 
representatives of all sides of the controversy. Included were even 
some of the most shrill of the anti-GM partisans. The report 
(<a href="genmod.html#g13">G13</a>) was released in May 2018.</p>

<p>One of the most significant findings was from comparison of chronic 
diseases in the United States where GM crops are very common, and in 
England where GM crops are almost unknown. No statistically significant 
differences were found. This report, however, will not be the final 
word.<p>

<ul>
  <li>The long term safety of foods produced by genetic modification is 
    unknown - they haven't been produced "long term".<p></p></li>
  <li>Just because current GM crops are thought safe, doesn't mean 
    all future ones will be.<p></p></li>
  <li>Genetic material from GM crops migrates to non-GM crops and 
    contaminates the genetic pool. This is now happening with corn in 
    Mexico, the center of genetic diversity for corn.<p></p></li>
  <li>Much controversy has been over glyphosphate, the major component 
    of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. Glyphosphate is rather safe 
    compared to many other herbicides, but Roundup is a blend, not just 
    glyphosphate. Statistically significant birth defects and miscarriages 
    have been noted in field worker families in Canada and Argentina 
    (<a href="genmod.html#g11">G11)</a>. Super-weeds are forcing resort to more 
    herbicides and more dangerous herbicides. This forces up the cost 
    of growing the crops, and further enriches Monsanto. <p></p></li>
  <li>GM crops greatly reduce genetic diversity and expose the food 
    supply to the possibility of monocrop disasters. When the courts 
    ruled the FDA had illegally approved GM Sugar Beets, the crop could 
    not be returned to normal because there was far too little non-GM 
    seed still available.<p></p></li>
  <li>Much of the available research is unreliable, because it has been 
    financed by the GM industry to prove their safety. The USDA and FDA 
    rely on this research for regulation.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Why can't we trust GM research more?</h2>

<p>It's not just GM research, it's <u>all</u> research on food safety 
and nutrition. Corporations involved are extremely wealthy and able to 
buy as many scientists as they need to "prove" whatever they want to 
prove, and as many politicians as they need to enforce their desires.</p>

<p>Well, we all know about politicians, but why are so many scientists 
so easy to buy? Research scientists produce no revenue. Their projects 
are expensive and totally dependent on grant money. Scientists depend 
on that grant money not only to fund projects, but for their very 
sustenance. Grant money comes from wealthy and powerful organizations 
that want a particular result from the research. Wrong results - no 
more money.</p>

<p>Grant money is often laundered through seemingly neutral organizations 
to conceal from the public where it comes from, but the scientists 
receiving the money are usually pretty aware of where it's coming from, 
what is expected of them, and what the consequences are if they come up 
with the "wrong" answer.</p>

<p>If a research report shows one positive outcome and a hand full of 
negatives, affected corporations will ballyhoo the positive in their 
promotions and simply not mention the negatives at all. If a scientist 
publishes a wrong answer, the involved industry may deploy other 
scientists to destroy their reputation and career.</p>

<p>Is the corporate world really so corrupt and uncaring that it will 
knowingly risk our health and our very lives for profit? If you really 
need to ask that question, you either just arrived from Mars or depend 
on Fox News for everything you know.</p>

<h2>Consumer Resistance Continues</h2>

<p>While 90% of American scientists are reported to consider GM foods 
safe, only 35% of American consumers do. Due to consumer pressure in 
Europe, GM labeling is required there, and at least one producer of 
GM seed there has ended all GM activity due to extreme consumer 
resistance.</p>

<h2>On the Plus Side</h2>

<p>The Vegan diet would be pretty much impossible without vats of hard 
working GM bacteria producing vitamin B12 for supplements. This vitamin, 
essential to the brain and nervous system, has no natural vegan source. 
Without it, Vegans would flake out totally.</p>

<p>Cheese would also be much less available, as the supply of animal 
rennet is inadequate. GM bacteria are producing plenty of non-animal 
rennet to take up the slack.</p>

<p>Some important drugs are also being produced by designer bacteria 
in quantities difficult or impossible to find in nature.</p>
