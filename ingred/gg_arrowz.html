<h1>Arrowroot</h1>
<br><img src="img/gg_arrow02g.jpg" alt="Arrowroot Rhizome, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Obedience Plant, Bermuda Arrowroot, Araru, Ararao; bilathi koova 
(Kerala, India); <i>Maranta arundinacea</i>]
<p>
   This plant is native to the tropical Americas, where it has been used 
   as food for at least 10,200 years, and cultivated for more than 
   7,700 years. It is best know for a starch made from long thin rhizomes 
   of young plants, but older, larger rhizomes are harvested to be used 
   similarly to yams. They are fairly neutral in flavor, but noticeably 
   sweet. Arrowroot is now grown commercially through the tropics 
   worldwide. The larger photo specimen was 10-1/2 inches long, 5 inches 
   across and weighed 3 pounds 9-1/4 ounces. It was not the largest in 
   the bin.</p>
   <p>The starch is preferred as a thickening agent for some uses because 
   it has unique properties compared to cornstarch and potato starch. 
   Particularly, it is neutral in flavor, will thicken at a lower 
   temperature, freezes without breaking, and will thicken acidic 
   liquids. The starch has been most used as a thickener in English 
   cuisine. In Korea and Vietnam it is made into noodles.</p>

Arrowroot plants grow to up to 6 feet tall, and are nice garden 
decoratives, but only in the tropics, only as far north as southern 
Florida. Arrowroot starch is extracted from the rhizomes of plants about 
1 year old, when they are long, narrow, have nearly white skins, and are 
easy to grind up. Fresh rhizomes for cooking are from older plants, with 
medium tan skins, but the skins are still very thin.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Arrowroot Rhizomes are not at all common 
in North America, but I have found them in a large Asian market here in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel).<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh rhizomes can be stored similarly to 
potatoes, in a cool place. They will still be solid for more than 
a week,but will steadily shrink.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Arrowroot rhizomes are very durable in wet 
cooking, becoming edible in about 15 minutes, but it is still quite 
firm after an hour. The rhizomes are fibrous, but the fibers are so 
soft they don't interfere with eating.

<h2>Arrowroot Starch</h2>
<br><img src="img/gg_arrofl02h.jpg" alt="/4 Teaspoon Arrowroot Starch" class=mrg> 
[Arrowroot Flour, Arrowroot Powder]
<p>
This starch is available from most supermarkets in North America. The 
flavor is very neutral and it is better for thickening acidic foods than 
Cornstarch. Its thickening power is as much as 1.5 times Cornstarch, 
so use less for the same thickening. It will break down from prolonged 
heat or break quickly if it reaches a boil.</p>
<p>Arrowroot gel freezes well, and will thicken well below the boiling 
point so can be used for fragile sauces. It produces a clear sauce, 
with an appearance less glossy than cornstarch. Arrowroot should not be 
used in dairy based sauces as it turns them slimy. It should be made 
into a slurry with cold water before adding to hot liquids, but 
smaller amounts can be sprinkled over a finished dish and stirred in 
for last minute thickening. Used this way, it will not clump like 
cornstarch. Always keep arrowroot thickened soups and sauces below 
the boiling point.

<h2>Arrowroot Vermicelli</h2>

[242; Mien Dong Nguyen Chat (Viet)]
<p>These noodles, made in Vietnam, are a bit strange. Just soaked, they 
have a somewhat unpleasant flavor. Boiled, whether soaked first or not, 
mere seconds after they are tender they start becoming mush (but the 
flavor is somewhat better). I can only presume this is supposed to 
happen to provide a thickening effect in soup they are added to. Ingred: 
pure flour of arrowroot (arrowroot starch), salt, water. 0.033 diameter, 
in 1.5 ounce skeins.<p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found these in one of the large Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles (San Gabriel).
