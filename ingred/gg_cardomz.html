<h3>Green Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; [True Cardamom, White Cardamom; Elaichi 
(India); Hel (Persia, Hebrew); Hayl (Arabic); <i>Elettaria cardamomum</i>]
<p>
Green Cardamom (small pods in the photo) is native to India 
and Malaysia, with India producing nearly the entire world's supply. The 
seeds are highly aromatic with a sharp brilliant flavor.  White cardamom 
is green that has been bleached. This is the cardamom to use whenever 
black is not specifically called for by name or region, and is the 
cardamom commonly available in Europe and North America.</p>

<h3>Black Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; [Brown Cardamom; Kali Elaichi, Moti Elaichi (India); 
  th&aacute;o qu&aacute; (Vietnam); <i>Amomum subulatum</i> (India), 
  <i>Amonum costatum</i> (China)]
<p>
Black Cardamom (large dark pods in photo) is not interchangeable with 
green cardamom. While the green is sharp and brilliant the black is dark 
and smoky with high tones of camphor and mint. It is the cardamom used in 
China and Vietnam, and in India it is used mostly in the Mughlai cuisine 
of the north. The Black Cardamom in the photo is the Chinese / Vietnamese 
species, which is quite a bit larger than the Indian species.</p>

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>

<p><b>Cardamom</b> spice is the seed pod and seeds of a member of the 
<a href="gg_ginger.html">Ginger family</a> (<i>Zingiberaceae</i>) 
native to India. It was known in ancient Egypt and mentioned in several 
medical papyri. It was also known in ancient Greece and in the Roman 
Empire as both a medicinal and culinary spice. Around 1000 years ago, 
Viking traders carried it to Scandinavia where it became quite popular 
and is still used today in many breads and pastries.</p>

<p>In the Arabic world and east through Persia and India it is used quite 
commonly to flavor coffee and tea, often as whole pods but also as seeds 
and powder.</p>

<p><b>Green Cardamom</b> is the cardamom used for sweets from North Africa 
through the Middle East and India. In the Middle East and North Africa it 
is also very widely used as a flavoring for coffee and tea, and for tea in 
India. In Northern Europe and North America it is most commonly a flavoring 
for breads and other baked goods. In India it is widely used in curries and 
masalas (spice mixes), particularly for more refined dishes, while black 
cardamom is used for rustic and more spicy dishes.</p>

<p><b>Black Cardamom</b> is used in the cuisines of China, particularly 
Sichuan, and also in Vietnam. In Sichuan it is used in long simmered 
recipes, particularly those featuring beef. In India it is included in 
garam masala spice mixes and in curries and pilaf, particularly in the 
Mughlai cuisine of northern India. It is almost never used in sweets 
but is often used in pickles.</p>

<p><b>White Cardamom</b> is simply Green Cardamom that has been bleached. 
The green is highly preferable, especially if whole pods are used, as the 
bleaching process removes some of the flavor. In India, pods that are evenly 
bright green are sold that way at a higher price, and unevenly colored pods 
are bleached.</p>

<p><b>Buying &amp; Storing:</b> &nbsp; Preferably buy from a source that 
has a high turnover so the cardamom is fresh. Whenever possible buy whole 
pods - they keep their strength much longer and many Indian recipes call 
for whole pods. While husked seeds have a shorter shelf life than pods, 
ground cardamom degrades very rapidly.</p>

<p>As with all other spices store in a tightly sealed jar in a cool dry 
place away from sunlight. Figure on replenishing your supply of pods about 
once a year for freshness, and ground more frequently.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; If you have only ground cardamom and a recipe 
calls for pods, the accepted equivalent for green cardamom is 10 pods to 
1-1/2 teaspoons ground. Keep in mind, ground is usually quite inferior 
as ground cardamom loses flavor very rapidly. When cooking with whole 
pods, they are usually very lightly crushed to allow liquid to pass 
through, but not so much that the seeds escape. In some parts of India 
the outer husk is peeled and the whole core added to the recipe.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>African Cardamoms</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="grains">Grains of Paradise</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  
  [Melegueta pepper, Alligator pepper, Guinea pepper, Guinea grains, 
  <i>Aframomum melegueta</i> - related  Atzoh, Mbongo (West Africa) 
  <i>Aframomum citratum</i>]
<br><img src="img/gg_grpara01h.jpg" alt="Seeds" class=mrg>
<p>
Native to West Africa, this spice is rarely seen in North America 
but some is grown in the Caribbean. It was important to 15th century 
Europe but was completely replaced by black pepper by the 16th century. 
Currently it is used in West and Central Africa and quite often used in 
Morocco and Tunisia. The seeds are always ground and added near the end 
of cooking. The photo specimens, about 0.12 inch (3 mm) were purchased 
from an on-line spice vender in the United States. The best 
substitute is probably <a href="gg_cardomz.html#cardb">Black Cardamom</a>. On the islands 
in the Gulf of Guinea the fresh fruits are eaten raw.

<h2 id="korar">Korarima</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Ethiopian Cardamom; 
  <i>Aframomum corrorima</i>]
<br><img src="img/gg_korar01h.jpg" alt="Seeds" class=mrg>
<p>Native to Tanzania and western Ethiopia, this spice is very 
important to the cuisines of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is used in various 
spice mixtures, such as berbere, mitmita, and awaze hot sauce. The pods 
are smooth like green cardamom, but dark brown and about the size of 
black cardamom pods. the photo specimens, about 0.17 inch long, were 
purchased from an on-line spice vendor in the United States. The best 
substitute is probably <a href="gg_cardomz.html#cardb">Black Cardamom</a>, somewhat 
different flavor, but in the ballpark.
