<h1>Gingers</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Many of the Gingers (<i>Zingiberaceae</i>) are noted 
for spectacular flowers and are planted as decoratives throughout the 
tropics. Other species are of great commercial and culinary value 
worldwide, producing both spices and flavorings - and some are of both 
decorative and culinary value.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>For many ginger plants, the used part is the rhizome. These are not 
roots but bulbous underground stems from which grow roots (that look like 
normal roots) and leaf bearing stems. In culinary practice, however, they 
are commonly called "roots". For others the seeds are the culinary 
part, and for a few, the leaves or flowers.</span>

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Gingers are all tropical plants originating from South and Southeast 
Asia, and Central and South America. Several Old World species were 
spread far and wide in prehistoric times, so their exact origin can no 
longer be determined. Since the age of European exploration they have 
been spread to tropical areas throughout the world and become 
important in all the local cuisines.</p>


<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties</h2>

[Otaiko, Atariko, Rohojie, Rohoji, Rigije, Orima; <i>Aframomum subsericeum</i> 
<p>Native to Nigeria and Cameroon, and south into D.R. Congo, this plant is 
of the Ginger family. Its seeds are used as a spice in soups in Nigeria, 
particularly Banga (Palm) and Pepper soups. These seeds taste similar to 
Green Cardamom seeds but the flavor is not a bright. The photo specimens 
were about 0.075 inch diameter and 0.210 inch long (2 x 5.3 mm). They were 
purchased from a US vendor of West African foods for 2021 US $4.87 per ounce.

[True Cardamom, White Cardamom; Elaichi (India); Hel (Persia, Hebrew); 
Hayl (Arabic); <i>Elettaria cardamomum</i>]
<p>
Green Cardamom is native to India 
and Malaysia with India producing nearly the entire world's supply. The seeds 
are highly aromatic with a sharp brilliant flavor.  White cardamom is green 
that has been bleached. This is the cardamom to use whenever black is 
not specifically called for by name or region, and is the cardamom commonly 
available in Europe and North America.

qu&aacute; (Vietnam); <i>Amomum subulatum</i> (India), <i>Amomum 
costatum</i> (China)]
<p>
Black Cardamom  is not interchangeable with 
green cardamom. While the green is sharp and brilliant the black is dark 
and smoky with high tones of camphor and mint. It is the cardamom used in 
China and Vietnam, and in India it is often included in Garam Masala mixes 
and certain curries. It is also used medicinally, particularly in China.

[(Japan); Cao Guo, Tsao-kuo (China); <i>Amomum tsaoko</i>]
<p>
This plant grows in the mountains of Yunan provence of China, 
Laos and Viet Nam. It is IUCN Red listed NT (Near Threatened) as its 
range is rather small and it is being overharvested. Some is in 
cultivation. This Cardamom is used medicinally and to a much lesser 
extent as a spice in cuisine. The shell is tough and leathery, while the 
seeds are hard, tough, and less aromatic than those of regular Black 
Cardamom. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US $1.69 for 1-3/4 ounces (50 gms). 
The were up to 1.48 inches long by 0.79 inch diameter and the batch 
had an average weight of 0.13 ounces each (3.4 gm).

[Greater Galangal, Galanga, Siamese Ginger; Kha (Thai); Laos, Lengkuas, 
(Indonesia); Rieng (Viet); <i>Alpinia galanga</i>]
<p>
This is an essential ingredient for Southeast Asian cuisines, 
particularly those of Thailand and Indonesia. While it looks rather 
similar to ginger, the flavor is very different, the skin is lighter in 
color, the inside is white rather than yellow, and it's practically wood 
hard.  Galangal is more earthy, with flavors of citrus, pine and camphor.
</p>
<p>Fresh root is increasingly available in the US, with some now grown 
in California and Florida. Dried powder is also available, but fresh is 
highly preferred for most uses. It was a commonly used medicinal in 
Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries and is still used medicinally 
in Asia, as well as having a place in African American hoodoo magic.

<p>
Once much used as a flavoring and medicinal throughout Ancient and 
Medieval Europe, and featured in many herbals as preferred over greater 
galangal, this plant is now rare outside Southeast Asia. It is still used 
as a flavoring in Russia (to flavor vinegar) and the Baltic Countries 
(spice and medicinal). Extracts are used to flavor beverages and for 
similar uses. It is most used in Southern China, Vietnam and Indonesia in 
curries and the like, usually dried and ground. See the next paragraph 
for the "Lesser Galangal" more commonly known today.

[Sand Ginger, Aromatic Ginger;  Kenchur (Indonesia); Cekur (Malay); 
Shan Nai, Sha Jiang (China (sand ginger)); <i>Kaempferia galanga</i> | Resurrection 
Lily, <i>Kaempferia rotunda</i>]
<p>
<i>K. galanga</i> is a stemless plant originating in southern India, 
but no longer used in Indian cuisine. It is used for cooking in Malaysia 
and Indonesia, particularly Java and Bali. Outside this region it is known 
mostly as a medicinal, though some is used in dried form as a seasoning 
in China south of the Yangtze, including Sichuan.</p> 
<p>Unlike all other galangals, <i>K. galanga</i> rhizomes are dark and 
reddish in color. The photo specimens of <i>K. galanga</i> were purchased 
at a Los Angeles Asian market labeled "Sand Ginger". The nodules ranged 
from 3/4 inch to 1-1/8 inch diameter. The texture and flavor are very 
similar to <a href="gg_ginger.html#krach">Krachai</a> with a faint hint of licorice. 
More widely available Krachai makes a suitable culinary substitute. The 
medicinal properties of <i>K. galanga</i> are of considerable interest 
and are being studied particularly for use against worms and mosquitos.
</p>
<p><i>K. rotunda</i> is native to Southeast Asia and is widely grown as 
a medicinal and decorative but is not used in cooking. It is mainly used 
ground to a paste to treat sprains and similar problems but is being 
studied for antioxidant properties. It is called "resurrection lily" 
because it's light blue orchid-like flowers appear right out of the 
ground in spring, before any stems or foliage appear.

(Gujarati), Alay (Marathi); Adrak (Hindi, Urdu); Zanjabil (Arabic); 
<i>Zingiber officinale</i>]
<p>
Originally from South or Southeast Asia, ginger is far and away the 
most used of the <i>Zingiberaceae</i> family rhizomes. The top ten 
producers ship more than a million and a half tons (US) annually, with 
India China and Indonesia the major producers. Nigeria is the only major 
producer outside Asia. Available fresh, dried and ground, ginger is now 
important in every major cuisine worldwide. The photo specimen was 7-1/2 
inches long and weighed 12 ounces, a small part of a ginger "reef". Reefs 
can easily exceed 30 pounds.</p>

<p>Ginger is also important in both formal and folk medicine, particularly 
for nausea and stomach upset. It has been shown effective against motion 
sickness, morning sickness and nausea from chemotherapy, but not for 
postoperative nausea. It is also used as a flavoring to cover 
medicinal tastes.

<p>
This is regular ginger when new sections of rhizome have formed and 
sprouted leaf stems. It is juicier and much milder than older ginger 
and has a tender skin that is generally not peeled. It is seasonal so not 
always available. Ginger in this state of growth is often pickled, 
particularly in Southeastern India. It is often called for in Southeast 
Asian recipes and is prefered for general cooking in Cambodia. &nbsp;

<h2 id="jake">Ginger - Jamaica</h2>
<br><img src="img/gg_gingerj01k.jpg" alt="Bottles from Jamaica Ginger" class=mrg>
[Jake]
<p>
Jamaica Ginger was a patent medicine concoction which gained 
notoriety during the US period of Prohibition. Since it was 70% to 80% alcohol 
and reasonably palatable a large demand for the product developed.  The 
U.S. Treasury Department forced a change in the formulation to require 
enough ginger solids to make it unpalatable. Enterprising producers used 
various subterfuges to get it to pass government inspection but still be 
drinkable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately one of the most successful of these used a plasticizer 
that, while originally thought safe, turned out to be a neurotoxin. As many 
as 50,000 people who consumed it were struck with serious paralysis of the 
extremities and most never recovered. &nbsp;

Native to West Africa, this spice is rarely seen in North America 
but some is grown in the Caribbean. It was important to 15th century 
Europe but was completely replaced by black pepper by the 16th century. 
Currently it is used in West and Central Africa and quite often used in 
Morocco and Tunisia. The seeds are always ground and added near the end 
of cooking. The photo specimens, about 0.12 inch (3 mm) were purchased 
from an on-line spice vender in the United States. The best 
substitute is probably <a href="gg_ginger.html#cardb">Black Cardamom</a>. On the islands

important to the cuisines of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is used in various 
spice mixtures, such as berbere, mitmita, and awaze hot sauce. The pods 
are smooth like green cardamom, but dark brown and about the size of 
black cardamom pods. the photo specimens, about 0.17 inch long, were 
purchased from an on-line spice vendor in the United States. The best

<i>B. rotunda</i>]
<p>
Originating in Southeast Asia and Southern China, this plant grows 
from rhizomes that have the form of a cluster of long fingers. It is not much 
available fresh outside Thailand, but it is available in Asian 
markets frozen or put up in jars of brine. Both forms are quite acceptable 
for use. It is also available in tiny jars as dried powder and as bags of 
dried strips, but dried is more bitter and less flavorful than frozen or 
brined. Krachai is sometimes wrongly labeled "lesser galangal", a very 
different plant.</p>
<p>Krachai is used mainly in Thailand though some is used in Vietnam, 
Malaysia and Indonesia. Outside those regions it is almost unknown except 
dried as a medicinal in China. The flavor is milder and much more earthy than 
ginger or galangal. It is most often used in fish dishes but also with 
beef and rice or as a general aromatic vegetable. The photo 
specimen in the front was 3-7/8 inches long and 0.52 inch diameter at the 
big end. These were brined.

<p>
Turmeric probably originated in Southeast Asia but was carried far 
and wide in prehistoric times. Today it is most used in India where the 
majority of dishes contain at least some. In India it is most used dried 
and ground to a powder before using, but in Southeast Asia it is often 
used fresh. Turmeric leaves are also used in some recipes.</p>
<p>The intense yellow-orange color of fresh turmeric will stain all your 
kitchen equipment and cutting boards bright yellow, but it is not at all 
permanent and fades very quickly exposed to sunlight. Turmeric is now 
being studied as one of the most powerful natural anti-cancer substances 
and for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Java Turmeric looks the same,

Fresh white turmeric is used in Thailand and Indonesia as an aromatic 
vegetable. It is milder than yellow turmeric and doesn't present the staining 
problem. Dried it is more bitter and must be used sparingly. Turmeric 
leaves are also used in some recipes. In India it is used as a flavoring in 
pickles. Medicinally it is used in China and Japan and also in perfumes and 
liquors. It can often be found in markets serving an Indian community, sold 
alongside fresh yellow turmeric and can be frozen for longer storage.

   This plant is native to the tropical Americas, where it has been used 
   as food for at least 10,200 years, and cultivated for more than 
   7,700 years. It is best know for a starch made from long thin rhizomes

   <p>The starch is preferred as a thickening agent for some uses because 
   it has unique properties compared to cornstarch and potato starch. 
   Particularly, it is neutral in flavor, will thicken at a lower 
   temperature, freezes without breaking, and will thicken acidic 
   liquids. The starch has been most used as a thickener in English

   cooked by boiling 15 to 60 minutes. Such a wide range is possible 
   because it remains crisp with long cooking. It is most used as an 
   appetizer or snack, and tastes similar to sweet corn. It has been
