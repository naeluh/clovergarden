<h1>Ginger</h1>

[Khing (Thai); Saenggang (Korea); Inji (Tamil, Malaysian); Aadu (Gujarati), 
Alay (Marathi); Adrak (Hindi, Urdu); Zanjabil (Arabic); 
<i>Zingiber officinale</i>]
<p></p>
Originally from South or Southeast Asia, ginger is far and away the 
most used of the <i>Zingiberaceae</i> family rhizomes. The top ten 
producers ship more than a million and a half tons (US) annually, with 
India, China and Indonesia the major producers. Nigeria is the only major 
producer outside Asia. Available fresh, dried and ground, ginger is now 
important in every major cuisine worldwide. The photo specimen was 7-1/2 
inches long and weighed 12 ounces, a small part of a ginger "reef". Reefs 
can easily exceed 30 pounds.

<p>Ginger is also important in both formal and folk medicine, particularly 
for nausea and stomach upset. It has been shown effective against motion 
sickness, morning sickness and nausea from chemotherapy, but not for 
postoperative nausea. It is also used as a flavoring to cover 
medicinal tastes.</p>

<p>
This is regular ginger when new sections of rhizome have formed and 
sprouted leaf stems. It is juicier and much milder than older ginger 
and has a tender skin that is generally not peeled. It is seasonal so not 
always available. Ginger in this state of growth is often pickled, 
particularly in Southeastern India. It is often called for in Southeast 
Asian recipes and is preferred for general cooking in Cambodia.</p>

<p>This ginger, lightly pickled and dyed a light pink, is the ginger 
served with sushi and sashimi in Japanese restaurants.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This ginger is now easy to find in Asian markets 
that serve a significant Southeast Asian community, at least here in 
Southern California, <u>when it is in season</u>. It is stored the same 
as regular ginger but is much more perishable, so should be used soon 
after purchase.

<p>Countries that are significant Ginger users.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>China:</b> &nbsp; Fresh ginger is often used in fish dishes to 
  reduce the "fishiness". It is also candied for use as a sweet, and a 
  beverage is made for the treatment of colds. Dried and ground ginger 
  are also used depending on the region.</li>
<li><b>India:</b> &nbsp; Fresh ginger is one of the most important 
  flavorings used in cooking curries and vegetables. It is particularly 
  liked with lentils and other pulses. In Southern India ginger is widely 
  used to make candy and young ginger is pickled. Dried and powdered 
  ginger is also used in masalas (spice mixes) but rarely in recipes. 
  Medicinally it is used to treat colds, generally as a tea.</li>
<li><b>Africa</b> (Sub-Saharan): &nbsp; As with many other foods and 
  spicings, fresh ginger follows Indian practice and is an essential 
  flavoring.</li> 
<li><b>Japan:</b> &nbsp; Fresh ginger is often grated and used as a 
  flavorful garnish on tofu, noodles and other dishes. Fresh ginger is 
  pickled in two forms: Gari, a light pink form made from young ginger is 
  served in sushi bars; Beni shoga, a deep red form is used as a 
  condiment and toping on many dishes. Dried ginger is very rarely used.
  </li>
<li><b>Korea:</b> &nbsp; Finely chopped or grated fresh ginger is an 
  important flavoring ingredient in kimchi (Korean sauerkraut) and is 
  also widely used in general cooking.</li>
<li><b>Europe</b> &nbsp; The Romans imported fresh ginger by the shipload 
  as a favored flavoring ingredient. Since the fall of the Empire it has 
  been used mostly in powdered form for baking, and as a flavoring in 
  beverages.</li>
<li><b>North America</b> &nbsp; Until recently, usage was similar to 
  Europe, but today, with wholesale adoption of ethnic cuisines, fresh 
  ginger is common even in supermarkets. Here in Southern California, any 
  self respecting produce market has 20 to 50 pounds on display, and it 
  sells rapidly. Medicinally it is used to treat nausea.</li>
<li><b>Southeast Asia:</b> &nbsp; Ginger is one of the most important 
  ingredients in an endless number of dishes. Medicinally, it is used 
  sweetened with palm sap (palm sugar) as a preventive and treatment for 
  colds and flu.</li>
<li><b>Middle East / North Africa</b> &nbsp; Dried ginger powder is used 
  as a flavoring in tea.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fresh Ginger</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Look for rhizomes that are smooth 
and very firm rather than wrinkled, and which are free of bruises or dark 
spots. Best to buy one large piece rather than several small ones to 
minimize the cut or broken area.<p></p>

<p>Most instructions have you wrap ginger in dry toweling and store it in 
the refrigerator in a paper bag - but I use it much too frequently to be 
all the time unwrapping and wrapping. I have found it keeps very well in 
a short plastic bag set in a tray in the refrigerator door <u>with the 
top left wide open</u>. In a closed bag it will soon go to mold.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Ginger is used sliced (in soups and stews - to 
be removed (or not) before serving), chopped fine (in stir fries, curries 
and the like) and grated. <b>Ginger Juice</b> is called for in some 
recipes and is made by grating ginger and wringing the juice out by 
wrapping it tightly in a cloth.<p></p>

<p>Most recipes call for peeling ginger but this is not necessary. My 
practice, and the practice of a number of chefs, is to shave off the 
gnarly parts and leave most of the skin on. Some Southeast Asian recipes 
actually call for the skin to be left on because much of the flavor is 
close under the skin.</p>

<p>When preparing for most uses, cut slices crosswise as thin as you can 
to break the fibers. Then lay out the slices in an overlapping stack and cut 
into narrow slivers. Sometimes these are used as is, but otherwise bunch them 
up and cut into tiny pieces, then chop further or mash in a mortar as 
appropriate for the recipe. Never slice ginger lengthwise.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to used dried ginger in recipes calling for fresh - it 
just isn't the same thing at all.</p>

<h2>Dried <small>&amp;</small> Powdered Ginger</h2>

<p>Powdered ginger is familiar in North America and Europe as an ingredient 
in many baked goods, ginger bread for example. It is widely 
used in Middle Eastern and North African cuisines and in India for 
some specialty dishes and as an ingredient in masalas (spice powders). 

<p>Fresh ginger can not be used as a substitute for dried, nor vice versa 
- they just aren't the same thing at all.</p>
