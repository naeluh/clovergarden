<p>
Native to West Africa, this spice is rarely seen in North America but 
some is grown in the Caribbean. It was important to 15th century Europe 
but was completely replaced by black pepper by the 16th century. 
Currently it is used in West and Central Africa and quite often used in 
Morocco and Tunisia. The seeds are always ground and added near the end 
of cooking. The photo specimens, about 0.12 inch (3 mm) were purchased 
from an on-line spice vender in the United States. The best substitute 
is probably <a href="gg_cardomz.html"><b>Black Cardamom</b></a>, though 
this spice has a brighter flavor. It also has quite a bit of the tongue 
numbing effect found with <a href="sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan 
Peppercorns</b></a>.</p> 
<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; Many food writers 
have come to grief by confusing Melegueta Pepper with Malagueta Pepper, 
which is a small red bird chili, also known as Piri Piri. For details 
see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.<p></p>

These are the fruit pods of the Grains of Paradise plants, which can 
be up to 2-3/4 inches long. On the formerly Portuguese islands of 
S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea these pods 
are often eaten raw.
