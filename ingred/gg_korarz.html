[Ethiopian Cardamom, False Cardamom; <i>Aframomum corrorima</i> (Ginger 
family)]
<p>
When Ethiopian or Eritrean recipes call for Cardamom, this is what they 
really mean. This plant is native to Tanzania, western Ethiopia, southwestern 
Sudan and western Uganda. In much of its range it is gathered in the wild, 
but it is cultivated in Ethiopia and Eritrea.<p>
<p>While the Korarima plant is 
closely related to the common <a href="gg_cardomz.html"><b>Green 
Cardamom</b></a>, the fig shaped pods are much larger, as are the seeds within 
them. The photo specimen seeds were about 0.165 inch (4.2 mm) long.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This spice can be found on-line from spice vendors, 
particularly those specializing in Ethiopian foods. They can also be found 
in Ethiopian markets in North America, if you can find one of those. 
The photo specimens were from Brundo Spice Company and cost 2021 Us $5.50 
per ounce.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; The best substitute is the common 
<a href="gg_cardomz.html"><b>Green Cardamom</b></a>. While the size of the 
seeds is much different, the flavor is very similar. Some writers say to 
substitute Indian Black Cardamom, which has larger pods and larger seeds, but 
its flavor is much different.<p></p>
