<p>Turmeric probably originated in Southeast Asia but was carried far and 
wide in prehistoric times. Today it is most used in India where the 
majority of dishes contain at least some. In India it is most used dried 
and ground to a powder before using, but in Southeast Asia it is often 
used fresh. Turmeric leaves are also used in some recipes.</p>
<p>The intense yellow-orange color of fresh turmeric will stain all your 
kitchen equipment and cutting boards bright yellow, but it is not at all 
permanent and fades very quickly exposed to sunlight. Turmeric is now 
being studied as one of the most powerful natural anti-cancer substances 
and for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Java Turmeric looks the same, but 
is said to have stronger medicinal properties.</p>

<p>Fresh white turmeric is used in Thailand and Indonesia as an aromatic 
vegetable. It is milder than yellow turmeric and doesn't present the 
staining problem. Dried it is more bitter and must be used sparingly. 
Turmeric leaves are also used in some recipes. In India it is used as a 
flavoring in pickles. Medicinally it is used in China and Japan and also 
in perfumes and liquors. It can often be found in markets serving an 
Indian community, sold alongside fresh yellow turmeric and can be frozen 
for longer storage.

<p>These notes apply to both Yellow and White Turmeric. Turmeric rhizomes 
sprout very readily indoors, but do not thrive outdoors here in Southern 
California because the weather is just too cool much of the year and the 
air is way too dry. I'm going to try raising it as an indoor plant.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; When buying turmeric powder try to 
get it from a market serving an Indian community or from some other high 
volume vendor. That purchased from supermarkets in tiny jars often has 
color but less flavor than sawdust. Recently ground turmeric from an 
Indian market is far and away superior. Fresh turmeric (both yellow and 
white) can now often be found in markets serving Indian communities - at 
least here in Southern California. Whole dried turmeric rhizomes are 
also available.

<p>Fresh turmeric will keep for weeks just sitting in the potato bin at 
room temperature, but for longer storage, freeze it.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh turmeric is often called for in Southeast 
Asian recipes - generally grated and/or pounded to a pulp. Yellow Turmeric 
will stain your kitchen equipment something awful - but the stain will be 
all gone in a few days because it's not light or oxygen stable. You can 
substitute ground turmeric in most recipes without too much loss of 
flavor.<p></p>
