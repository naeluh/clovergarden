Coffee is a member of the Madder family (<i>Rubiaceae</i>). This 
family contains over 611 genera and over 13,000 species, but less than 
a handful have culinary usages, almost entirely for flavoring beverages 
and and flavoring and coloring a few foods. Coffee, however, 
is the economic blockbuster of the family.</p>

<p>One legend has it the effects of coffee were first noticed by 
a goatherd in Ethiopia, seeing the friskiness of his flock after 
consuming the leaves and berries. Another says it was a Sufi mystic 
noticing frisky birds in Ethiopia. There are others - and, like 
most food stories, none are likely true.</p>
<p>The primary active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, but there are 
others that have been insufficiently studied. Coffee was first 
used as a tea made from the leaves, and some indigenous peoples in East 
Africa still use it that way. It was found, however, that the beans 
within the berries were more effective, and roasted they were more 
palatable. The photo specimens are Colombia Supremo on the right, 
about 0.50 inch long, 0.35 inch wide and 0.22 inch thick, and 
Colombia Peaberry on the left, up to 0.43 inch long, 0.29 inch wide and 
0.24 inch thick, both high grown and roasted medium. There are usually 
two "beans" per berry, but only one in the case of peaberry.</p>
<p>Because coffee beans do not ripen evenly and 
incompletely ripe beans are inferior, quality coffee beans must be 
picked by hand, making several passes through the plantation. This is 
the most labor intensive part of coffee production. In the lowland 
plantations, whole branches are stripped of berries, ripe, unripe and 
overripe and prepared for shipment to large commercial roasters who 
sell ground coffee in cans.</p>
<p>There are many species of coffee, but only three are widely used for 
beverages worldwide.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
  <li><h3><i>C. arabica</i>:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most popular with 
  connoisseurs as having a lower acidity and a more delicate taste and 
  aroma. Unfortunately, arabica is particularly vulnerable to a fungus 
  infection called "coffee leaf rust" which makes growing it expensive.  
  Over 75% of coffee grown is arabica.
  </li>
  <li><h3><i>C. canephora</i>:</h3> &nbsp; Two varieties of this species, 
  commonly lumped as "robusta", are favorites of coffee growers as they 
  are less trouble and offer a higher yield. Major coffee blenders often 
  use quite a bit of robusta to make their blend stronger. Also, robusta 
  has over twice as much caffeine as arabica. It accounts for about 20% 
  of coffee grown.</li>
  <li><h3><i>C. liberica</i>:</h3> &nbsp; "Liberian Coffee" from West 
  Africa was heavily planted in Indonesia and the Philippines in the 
  1890s when the leaf rust wiped out the arabica plantations. Some is 
  still grown in Indonesia but it is the major variety in the Philippines. 
  In character it is more like robusta than arabica.</li>
  <li><h3><i>C. charrieriana</i>:</h3> &nbsp; This species from Cameroon 
  in central Africa is a curiosity - it is caffeine free. I don't 
  know if any attempt is being made to commercialize it.</li>
  </ul>
<p>In wholesale trade there are three basic categories:
<ul>
  <li><h3>High Grown Mild:</h3> &nbsp; arabica beans grown at least 
    2000 feet above sealevel, often between 4000 and 6000 feet.</li>
  <li><h3>Brazilian:</h3> &nbsp; lowland arabica beans, which may or may 
    not come from Brazil, but are grown at below 2000 feet.</li>
  <li><h3>Robusta:</h3> &nbsp; beans of the <i>canephora</i> species 
    (see above).</li>
  </ul>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg>Coffee Terms <small>&amp;</small> Trivia</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Green Coffee Bean Extract:</h3> &nbsp; An extraction long used in 
the "Swiss Water Process" for decaffeination, this is the latest "sure fire 
magic cure" promoted by the weight loss industry. It's probably at least 
as effective as all the other "sure fire magic cures" they've promoted 
over the years. It's just amazing how these wonderful products have 
completely banished obesity from America. What is that you say?<p></p>

<h3>Grinding Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Coffee should be ground as fine as 
will work with the type of filter used. It degrades very rapidly after 
grinding as aromatic elements evaporate. Best to have a coffee grinder 
at home and grind fresh every morning. I use a burr grinder, but a very 
low cost whirling blade grinder works well too (but I use mine only for 
grinding spices). Second best is to buy whole bean and grind it at 
the store and seal it back up. Trader Joe's, for one, provides a 
grinder for this purpose, and their containers reseal tightly. Some 
supermarkets also provide a grinder, but their packaging is usually 
not as good - just bags.<p></p> 

<h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; This must be brought to a full boil or the coffee 
will taste terrible, but it should be turned off immediately it boils or 
it will get flat. A French gourmet did extensive experimenting with water 
temperature and found the coffee was better if you let the water cool 
a few minutes to about 200&deg;F/95&deg;C before pouring on the grounds 
- but only by a very small margin. Just as with beer, the quality of the 
water affects the quality of the brew.<p></p>

<h3>Coffee Maker:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, you steep ground coffee beans 
in water at about 200&deg;F/95&deg;C until the water tastes like coffee. 
Simple is best and glass or ceramic are the best materials for making 
coffee in. I use a Chemex flask and unbleached filters, with the flask 
set over warming heat. My only addition is to insert two bamboo chopsticks 
(now very thoroughly blackened) before placing the filter cone - this 
speeds the filtration. I have no interest in any other kind of coffee 
maker, so if you want comparative reviews, you'll have to look elsewhere. 
I do also have a French plunger coffee maker, but use it only for tea.
<p></p>

<h3>Roast Levels:</h3> &nbsp; The exact temperature reached by the beans 
during roasting affects the balance of varietal coffee flavor versus the 
roast flavor, as well as acidity and body of the resulting brew.
<p>Personally, I think it could stop at "Full City", but it doesn't. 
Recently (2011), the yuppie class was much into dark roasts, but I've 
heard they've been lightening up. Of course the marketeers may favor 
darker roasts - they can buy the cheapest beans they can get since you 
won't be able to tell the difference. The darker roasts are preferred 
by Europeans and others who smother their coffee with cream and sugar, 
the lighter roasts are ideal for those of us who take our coffee without 
adulterants.</p>

<p>This table is pretty representative, but there are minor variations. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Cinnamon Roast:</h3> (385&deg;F/196&deg;C) Tea-like character, 
  sharp acidic tones. Beans are mottled light brown with no gloss.
  </li>
<li><h3>New England Roast:</h3> (401&deg;F/205&deg;C) A specialty roast 
  that particularly displays the regional character of the beans, with 
  distinctive and interesting acidity.</li>
<li><h3>American Roast:</h3> (410&deg;F/210&deg;C) A roast used for some 
  single origin coffees displaying their regional characteristics. 
  Medium light brown, no surface oil.</li>
<li><h3>City Roast:</h3> (426&deg;F/219&deg;C) A roast very often used for 
  specialty coffees. Coffee flavors with regional characteristics still 
  quite good. Medium brown, slightly glossy surface, no obvious oil.</li>
<li><h3>Full City Roast:</h3> (437&deg;F/225&deg;C) A common roast for 
  espresso blends. Medium dark with just noticeable oil sheen. Roast 
  flavor is beginning to take over from coffee flavor.</li>
<li><h3>Vienna Roast:</h3> (448&deg;F/230&deg;C) Regional coffee flavors 
  are now significantly eclipsed by roast flavors. Moderately dark brown 
  with light surface oil.</li>
<li><h3>French Roast:</h3> (464&deg;F/240&deg;C) Roast flavors now 
  dominate over coffee flavors, and burn flavors become noticeable - 
  acidity rather subdued. Dark brown and shiny with surface oil.</li>
<li><h3>Italian Roast:</h3> (473&deg;F/245&deg;C) Roast flavors begin to 
  be overcome by burned flavors, acidity is gone and it brews a thin 
  bodied cup. Very dark brown and very shiny with surface oil.</li>
<li><h3>Spanish Roast:</h3> (482&deg;F/250&deg;C) Burned coffee - 
  tar and charcoal flavors dominate. Brews a flat cup (no acidity at all) 
  with thin body. Pretty much black and very shiny with oil.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Coffee Houses:</h3> &nbsp; The first European coffee house was 
opened in Venice in 1645, but the most famous was opened in Vienna 
in 1683 by Polish/Ukrainian Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki (Georg Franz 
Kolschitzky in Viennese). It was to him the King of Poland awarded 
the coffee beans abandoned by the Turks in their defeat at the Battle 
of Vienna. The Viennese did not take to Turkish style coffee, so business 
was not real good - until he invented filtering the coffee and adding 
milk or cream - then business was very good indeed.<p></p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg>Specific Varietals:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Armenian Coffee:</h3> &nbsp; This coffee is found in Los Angeles 
County and Armenia (for other regions see "Turkish Coffee"). Just about 
every multi-ethnic market here in LA has medium and dark beans (often 
used "half and half") appropriate for this concoction. It must be ground 
to powder, boiled and served unfiltered, with or without sugar, but 
no milk or cream.</li>

<li><h3>Brazilian:</h3>  &nbsp; Brazil is the world's foremost coffee 
grower, producing between 30% and 35% of all the world's coffee. It is 
pretty much all undistinguished lowland coffee destined for the biggest 
commercial roasters. The best grade, that sold to specialty roasters 
as "Brazilian" is "Bourbon Santos", which is produced only by young 
trees in their first two or three years of production. It is a middle 
of the road coffee, but better than most Brazilian.</li>

<li><h3>Celebes:</h3> Situated northeast of Java, this island produces 
another world famous coffee, similar to the Sumatran. Perhaps a little 
less rich and a little more acidy. Manado is considered the best, 
with Rantepao considered a close second.</li>

<li><h3>Civet Coffee:</h3> &nbsp; In some coffee growing regions, including 
the Philippines, mongoose relatives called palm civets are up all night 
eating coffee berries. Of course they are up all night, anyone who eats 
that much coffee won't be able to sleep. Civets are very fussy and only 
eat perfectly ripe berries. The pulp is digested and the beans pass 
through (though slightly altered), to be collected and rinsed by 
gatherers. Most is exported to Japan, where they are willing to pay 
absurd prices, over 2013 US $50 per pound, for "special" coffee.</li> 

<li><h3>Columbian:</h3> &nbsp; This country is a coffee powerhouse 
second only to Brazil, but produces better coffee. The best grade is 
"supremo" with "extra" the second grade - but there is also a mix of 
the two called "excelso". The leading regions are Medellin, Armenia 
and Manizales, often mixed as "MAM". All very respectable coffees.
</li>

<li><h3>Decaffeinated Coffee</h3> &nbsp; Coffee for people who don't 
want to stay awake. Green beans are steamed, then subjected to one of 
several solvent processes to remove the caffeine, hopefully leaving all 
the flavor constituents (success varies). For a run down of the many 
processes see the Wikipedia article 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination">Decaffeination</a>.

<li><h3>Dominican:</h3> &nbsp; A "middle of the road" coffee from the 
Dominican Republic, often labeled Santo Domingo because it sounds 
more marketable.</li>

<li><h3>El Salvador:</h3> &nbsp; Rather bland coffee for commercial 
roasters. Best grade is "strictly high grown".</li>

<li><h3>Ethiopian:</h3> &nbsp; Ethiopia is probably where coffee originally 
came from, and many wild varieties still exist there. Most Ethiopian 
coffee shipped to North America comes from around the city of Harrar, 
and may be called "Ethiopian Harrar" or some other name with "Harrar" 
in it. This coffee has a rich taste with winey aftertaste. On the other 
hand, wild coffee gathered in southeastern Ethiopia and sold (generally 
not in North America) as "Ethiopian" or "Abyssinian" is bland and of 
poor quality.</li>

<li><h3>Guatemalan:</h3> &nbsp; Distinctive, rich and slightly smoky 
flavored coffees, amongst the best in the world. Best regionals are 
Antigua and Coban, best grades "strictly hard bean" (grown above 4500 
feet), "hard bean" grown between 4000 and 4500 feet.</li>

<li><h3>Haitian:</h3> &nbsp; The best are "strictly high grown" and 
second best "high grown". Both are soft rich flavored coffees.</li>

<li><h3>Instant Coffee:</h3> &nbsp; An abomination of our "convenience 
culture". Coffee, mostly from lower grades and robusta, brewed in 
industrial tanks, then dried and crumbled. Meant to be spooned into 
styrofoam cups of hot tap water for persons of low self esteem.
</li>

<li><h3>Jamaican:</h3> &nbsp; A very classy coffee. The highest grade is 
"Blue Mountain" and the highest of that is "Wallensford Estate", but 
nearly all is shipped to Japan where a much higher price can be 
fetched. "High Mountain Jamaican" is second best. Lowland Jamaica is 
not much better than El Salvador.</li>

<li><h3>Java:</h3> &nbsp;  Java once lead the world in coffee production, 
but it was all wiped out by the coffee leaf rust in the 1890s. Most 
of the arabica plantations were replaced with robusta, but arabica 
has made a slow comeback to some extent. Java arabica is full bodied 
and rich, and just a bit more acidy and spicy than Sumatra.</li>

<li><h3>Kenyan:</h3> &nbsp; An excellent coffee. Kenyan coffee is 
similar to Ethiopian Harrar with a winey aftertaste, but the flavor 
is more intense and full bodied. Considered by many one of the greatest 
coffees available. Grades are AA, A and B in that order.</li>

<li><h3>Kona:</h3> &nbsp; This is the only coffee of the United States, 
and it is fading fast due to the high cost of doing anything in Hawaii, 
a result of the booming tourist industry. It is medium bodied, richly 
flavored and highly aromatic with moderate acidity and a slightly 
winey aftertaste.</li>

<li><h3>Maragogipe:</h3> &nbsp; From Brazil, a mutant producing very 
large porous beans. It has now been transplanted to many coffee growing 
regions. Opinions vary from "woody and disagreeable" to "best coffee 
in the world". It is of limited availability.</li>

<li><h3>Mexican:</h3> &nbsp; Very good light coffee. Best are 
Oxaca Pluma and Altura Coatepec, also Sltura Orizaba and Altra Huatusco. 
This coffee should have a  medium roast and be taken without milk or 
cream, which would swamp the flavors.</li>

<li><h3>Mocha:</h3> &nbsp; Coffee grown and processed by ancient methods in 
Yemen, in the southwest corner of Arabia. It is still considered one 
of the best coffees in the world. The beans may look a bit rough due 
to the primitive milling methods. The best grades are Mattari, Sharki 
and Sanani in that order.</li> 

<li><h3>Mocha Java:</h3> &nbsp; This was the first significant blend, and 
is still very popular today as a premium blend. It was found that 
Yemen grown coffee (exported through the Arabian port of Mocha) and 
coffee grown by the Dutch on Java (Indonesia) compensated for each 
others weaknesses.</li>

<li><h3>Mysore:</h3> &nbsp; This is the main coffee of India. It is 
considered of heavy body, low acid and somewhat lifeless in flavor 
and aroma. The best grades are "arabica plantation A and B" and 
"arabica cherry AB".</li>

<li><h3>New Guinea:</h3> &nbsp; From Papua New Guinea, this is another 
fine Southeast Asian island coffee. Compared to the Sumatran it is 
rich but a little less full bodied and has similar acidity.</li>

<li><h3>Nicaraguan:</h3> &nbsp; Similarly bland to El Salvador - good for 
commercial roasters.</li>

<li><h3>Peaberry:</h3> &nbsp; This is coffee beans from berries containing 
only one "bean". This is a form often associated with Ethiopia, for 
marketing purposes, but about 5% to 10% of the crop in any plantation 
is peaberry. Experts (rather than marketeers) say they provide a 
slightly different cup of coffee, but not consistently better or worse.
</li>

<li><h3>Peruvian:</h3> &nbsp; A mildly acid, thin bodied but flavorful 
coffee similar to the middle grades of Mexican.</li>

<li><h3>Philippine:</h3> &nbsp; The Philippines were once a very major 
coffee exporter, but in the 1890s the leaf rust wiped out the plantations. 
Some were replanted in liberica and the Philippines is now the only 
country where major amounts of liberica are grown (though arabica and 
robusta are also grown there). Very little is exported because the 
Philippines is still a net importer of coffee, though production is 
increasing.</li>

<li><h3>Sumatran:</h3> &nbsp; A very famous coffee grown on the 
Malaysian island of Sumatra. Many consider Sumatran Mandheling and 
Ankola the best coffees in the world. These coffees are noted for 
richness, fullness of body and gentle acidity.</li>

<li><h3>Tanzanian:</h3> &nbsp; Coffee grown in the north, on the slopes 
of mount Kilimanjaro and nearby are quite similar to Kenyan, bright, 
full bodied and with a winey aftertaste. Grades are AA, A and B. 
In the south, completely different coffee is grown, usually called 
"Mbeya". This coffee is similar to Sumatran, full bodied, mellow with 
very little acid, and with hardly a hint of the winey aftertaste of 
other East African coffees.</li>

<li><h3>Turkish:</h3> &nbsp; A style, where coffee is roasted medium dark, 
ground to powder, brought to a full boil and served in a tiny cup without 
filtering. Usually it will be moderately or heavily sugared. This was 
the form in which coffee first appeared in Europe, before Jerzy Kulczycki 
started filtering and adding milk or cream. This form of coffee is 
extremely popular in the Balkans, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine and the Arabic 
regions. It is unknown in Los Angeles County and Armenia (see Armenian 
Coffee).</li>

<li><h3>Yunnan:</h3> &nbsp; This coffee, grown a little north of the 
Vietnam border, is similar to Sumatran, but with lower acidity. It 
has been available mostly in California but is considered worthy of 
wider distribution.</li>

<li><h3>Venezuelan:</h3> &nbsp; This country was once Colombia's most 
serious competitor, but they've traded coffee for oil. Little is 
exported because they now barely grow enough for local consumption.</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h2 id=health>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Claims and counter claims regarding the 
health impact of coffee drinking have been all over the map, with the 
anti-coffee voices particularly shrill. Current medical opinion is that 
moderate coffee drinkers (2 to 3 cups a day) are 10% to 15% less likely 
to die than non-drinkers in any period of time. The cause of this is not 
known, but another study showed that moderate coffee drinkers are less 
likely to commit suicide than non-drinkers. If you want an extensive 
health rundown, the article on Wikipedia 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coffee">
<b>Health effects of coffee</b></a> is probably as good as any and 
better than most.</p>

<h3>US Consumption:</h3> &nbsp; The United States is the largest 
importer of coffee. In 2009 the average American consumption was 9 
pounds per year. I'm not a heavy coffee drinker, but I probably account 
for something like 5 pounds.<p></p>
