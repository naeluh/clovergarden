<h1>Dogbane Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Dogbane family (<i>Apocynaceae</i>) is a medium size family 
of mostly inedible and toxic plants. Only one species of subfamily 
<i>Apocynoideae</i> can be found in food markets here in Southern 
California, and a couple inedible ones are noteworthy.</p>

<h2>River Leaf</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_lagiang01h.jpg" alt="Flowering La Giang plant" class=mrg>
<p>
This plant is native to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. The leaves 
are sour, and it's main culinary use is in a Vietnames sour soup called 
C&aacute; K&egrave;o, after the goby fish that is used in it. This herb 
is not currently available commercially in North America, particularly 
because the State of California is highly suspicious of water plants that 
can clog irregation chanels. The Vietnamese name of this plant translates 
to "River Leaf". It is also used as a medicinal within its range.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Loroco</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_loroco02e.jpg" alt="fresh Loroco flower buds" class=mrg>
[Quilite (indigenous); <i>Fernaldia pandurata</i>]
<p>
A vine native to the tropical Americas, Loroco is an important food 
item in El Salvador and Guatemala. The unopened buds, as shown in the 
photo, are used for cooking. Markets serving Latino communities 
here in Los Angeles have these frozen in plastic bags, brined 
in jars, and, much less commonly, fresh. The photo specimens were fresh, 
measuring up to 0.42 inch diameter by 1.2 inches long (not counting the 
stems). The price was 2016 US $10.99 per pound, but they are nearly 
weightless, so a generous handful cost only $0.55.</p>
<p>The taste raw is a floral sweetness with just a faint hint of 
bitterness. The closest thing I remember is squash flowers. Loroco is 
used as an herb in salads, rice dishes, stews and sauces. In El Salvador 
and Honduras they are used to flavor stuffings for pupusas (stuffed 
tortillas). Some say they're a natural aphrodisiac, but I have not 
confirmed that. They are best fresh, but the USDA has rated them as 
a "Moderate" pest risk, requiring specific measures for importation. 
Apparently those measures are being met, because they are becoming 
more common in Southern California (2016). Frozen are a reasonable 
alternative. They can be grown in home gardens in southern Florida, 
but only bloom part of the year there. Roots of this plant are reported 
to be highly toxic.

<h2>Utazi / Otazi</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_utazi01h.jpg" alt="Fresh Utazi Leaves" class=mrg>
[Bush Buck (English); Utazi (Ibo, Ibibo, Efik); Utezi (Edo); Arokeke 
(Yoruba); <i>Gongronema latifolium</i>]
<p>
This climbing shrub belongs to the Milkweed branch of the Dogbane Family, 
and is native to West Africa. Its broad, heart shaped leaves are usually 
eaten raw as a garnish on salads and the like, but also used in some 
soups. It has a somewhat bitter taste, and also has medicinal uses.

<h2>Pakalana Vine</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_cscreep01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Cowslip Creeper Plant" class=mrg>
[Creeping Cowslip, Tonkin jasmine, Tonkinese creeper, Chinese Violet, 
Fragrant Telosma; Dork man ton (Laos); Dok katchon (Thai); Hoa thien li 
(Viet); Kodi sambangi (Tamil); <i>Telosma cordata</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the tropics and subtropics from Pakistan to 
Indonesia and the Philippines, ranging north into southern China. It 
is grown as a fragrant decorative in the United States in USDA zones 
9a to 11. In Laos and Thailand the flower clusters are used in cooked 
salads and soups, also steamed and eaten with a dip. The flower clusters 
are picked before they open and look much like Central American Lorico 
(see above), but smaller. They are sold commercially and probably can 
be found in the frozen food cases of one or more of the large Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles. The plant also has medicinal uses.

<h2>Madd</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_madd01h.jpg" alt="Madd Fruit Cut Open" class=mrg>
[Saba (Mandinka); Madd (Wlof); Liane Saba (French); <i>Saba 
senegalensis</i>]
<p>
This broad leaved shrub or liana (depending on environment), is common 
in western tropical Africa, from Senegal to Togo. As a shrub it can have 
a trunk over 7 inches in diameter, and as a climbing liana it can be up 
to 130 feet long. Once used to make an inferior rubber, this plant is 
now highly valued for its fruit.</p>
<p>The oval fruit is quite variable in size, but can be up to 4 x 6 
inches. The orange pulp surrounding the large seeds is sweet-sour and 
eaten as is or used to make preserves. Its nutrition profile is similar 
to citrus. The leaves are used in sauces, condiments and appetizers.
This plant is both cultivated and harvested in the wild.

<h2>Bungo</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_bungo01h.jpg" alt="Bungo Flowers" class=mrg>
[Mbungo; Rubber Vine; <i>Saba comorensis</i>]
<p>
This broad leaved liana, growing to 65 feet, is very similar to the 
closely related Madd (see above), but with a much more extensive range: 
Somalia to Ethiopia and south to Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and 
Madagascar. It was once extensively used to produce "Congo Rubber", but 
the market was taken by sources producing better rubber. It is now 
valued for its fruit, widely used to make a refreshing drink very popular 
through its range. </p>
<p>The fruit is very similar to the Madd, except smaller, up to about 
2-1/2 inches diameter. The juice made from the fruit has been described 
as a combination of mango, orange and pineapple.  The plant flowers all 
year, and is a popular fruit bearing decorative.

<h2>Camaru</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_fockea01h.jpg" alt="Swolen Camaru Stem" class=mrg>
[Water Root; Kambro, Kameroep; <i>Fockea edulis</i> and possibly other <i>Fockea</i>]
<p>
<i>Fockea</i> is native to South Africa and Namibia, where its swollen 
stems (caudex) have long been used as food. This plant is entirely toxic, 
but the swollen stem can be detoxified by cooking. It has a slightly 
sweetish flavor and is used to make a sort of jam, as an alternate to 
watermelon. The stems can get up to 24 inches in diameter and weigh up 
to 22 pounds. It is also a popular succulent decorative and easily 
available in North America.

<h2>Star Jasmine</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_jasm07h.jpg" alt="Live Star Jasmine shrub in bloom" class=mrg>
[Confederate Jasmine; <i>Trachelospermum jasminoides</i>]
<p>
While this plant grows well throughout the former Confederate States, its 
alternate name is actually from the Malay Confederation. This plant, 
very common here in Southern California (not a Confederate State), has 
no culinary use except as an aromatic planting around the patio. It is, 
however, important in manufacture of perfumes and incense, particularly 
Chinese and Vietnamese incense.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Oleander</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_oleander01h.jpg" alt="Live Oleander shrub in bloom" class=mrg>
[<i>Nerium oleander</i>]
<p>
This very common plant is native to the western Mediterranean but has 
been introduced worldwide. It is particularly seen in Southern California 
where it has been heavily planted as nearly indestructible, car absorbing 
freeway landscaping. It's only culinary use is for attempting suicide, 
usually unsuccessfully. Although it is the most toxic commonly planted 
decorative, it's difficult to consume enough of the cardiac glycosides 
to do yourself in - but it can be done. Small children should be 
discouraged from using the convenient branches for roasting hot dogs.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Strophanthus</h2>
<br><img src="img/db_stroph01h.jpg" alt="S. gratus flowers, leaves" class=mrg>
[<i>Strophanthus gratus</i>, other species of genus <i>Strophanthus</i>]
<p>
This genus of plants is found mostly in tropical Africa, but some are 
found in southern India and Southeast Asia. They all have one and only 
one culinary usage, in the "hunting and gathering" phase of the cuisine 
- as a powerful arrow poisons. All other uses are medicinal, including 
treatments for head lice and snake bite. Seeds and other parts contain 
cardiac glycosides, such as g-strophanthin (Ouabain), k-strophanthin, 
and e-strophanthin.</p> 
<p>Ouabain has been found useful for treating heart failure and angina, 
particularly in France and Germany. Its general use for angina declined 
due to the plaque theory of heart attacks, but interest is now being 
revived, as the plaque theory is partially in doubt. In the USA the 
FDA regulates it as and extremely hazardous substance.
