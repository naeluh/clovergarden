<h1>Gentians - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Gentian Order (Order <i>Gentianales</i>) is a very large 
order of flowering plants in the Clade <i>Astrids</i>, but very few 
of these plants submit to culinary usage. Many more are medicinal or 
toxic, some very highly toxic. One, though, coffee, is of very great 
culinary, cultural, and economic importance. This order divides into 
five families, four of which have culinary applications.

uses are listed here, as well as the most important food product for 
each family. The pages linked to also include a few other genera and 
species of particular interest - culinary or not.</p>

   <h3>Yellow Gentian</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gn_yello01k.jpg" alt="Flowering Yellow Gentian Plant" class=mrg>
   [Bitter root, Bitterwort; <i>Gentiana lutea</i>]
   <p>
   The most commonly used Gentian for medicinal and bitter flavoring 
   purposes is the Yellow Gentian, native to the mountains of central and 
   southern Europe, though other species are said to also work well. While 
   dried root is most used, fresh foliage is also used.</p>
   <p>This root provides a bitter flavor used in Agnostura bitters and the 
   American soft drink Moxie as well as other drink flavorings and stomach 
   and digestive remedies. It was sometimes used in making beer, until hops 
   became the predominant bitter for that use.

   <h3>Common Centaury</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gn_centau01h.jpg" alt="Common Centaury Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
   [European Centaury; <i>Centaurium erythraea</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is often used as a substitute for Yellow Gentian, as it is 
   more common and more widespread. In addition to a wide distribution in 
   Europe, it is also found in North Africa and has been introduced into 
   North America and eastern Australia.	As with the Yellow Gentian, it is 
   bitter and considered an effective treatment for digestive and liver 
   problems. It is also considered useful for it's powerful antioxidants. 
   Centaury is most commonly consumed as an herbal tea.

<h2 id="strych">Strychnine Family</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <i>Loganiaceae</i>

<p>Though this family provides several of the most dreadful botanical 
toxins known, among them strychnine and curare, it also provides edible 
fruits (but don't eat the seeds).</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Monkey Oranges</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gn_strych01h.jpg" alt="Hanging Monkey Orange Fruit Balls" class=mrg>
   [<i>Strychnos spinosa</i>, <i>S. pungens</i>, <i>S. cocculoides</i>]
   <p>
   These three species of Strychnos, all native to southern Africa, produce 
   ball shaped fruit up to 4-3/4 inches diameter that turns yellow when 
   ripe. Inside the hard shells are tightly packed seeds, surrounded by an 
   edible sweet/sour pulp, the sourness coming from citric acid. These 
   fruits are eaten by the indigenous peoples of the regions and by many 
   African animals. The hard seeds are somewhat toxic, and should not be 
   eaten.

   <h3>Curare</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gn_strytox01k.jpg" alt="Curare Plant Illustration" class=mrg>
   [<i>Strychnos toxifera</i>, <i>S. pungens</i>, <i>S. cocculoides</i>]
   <p>
   The primary, in fact only, culinary use for this plant is in acquiring 
   wild animals to eat. Curare poison made from this plant has been used 
   by the indeginous people of the South American rain forests for 
   hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Arrows and blowgun darts are 
   dipped into concentrated toxin before use. An animal hit by such a 
   poisoned dart dies quickly of asphyxiation, as the voluntary muscles 
   are relaxed until the lungs don't work.  The toxin is harmless 
   ingested, so an animal so killed can be safely eaten.</p>
   <p>Interestingly, sublethal doses of curare have been found effective 
   in treating strychnine poisoning and tetanus (see next paragraph).

   <h3>Strychnine Tree</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gn_strynux01h.jpg" alt="Strychnine Fruit on Branch" class=mrg>
   [<i>Strychnos nux-vomica</i>]<p>
   This tree, native to India and Southeast Asia, produces hard ball shaped 
   green fruit that turn orange when ripe. The seeds within the fruit, and 
   the flowers, contain the powerful and very unpleasant toxins strychnine 
   and brucine. The bark is also toxic, but contains mostly brucine. 
   Strychnine was used medicinally before World War II, but not since.</p>

   <p>The effects of this toxin is violent muscle convulsions, even to the 
   point of bending over backwards until the spine snaps. This is very 
   similar to the effects of tetanus, but with a major difference. With 
   tetanus the participant is usually pretty dazed, but with strychnine 
   the mind remains clear, so the process can be enjoyed to the very end - 
   but there will be no screaming because the jaws are locked tight.
