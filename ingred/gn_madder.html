<h1>Madder Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Madder family (<i>Rubiaceae</i>) is also known as the 
Bedstraw Family and the Coffee Family. It contains over 611 genera 
and over 13,000 species, but less than a handful have culinary usages, 
entirely for flavoring beverages and a few foods. Coffee, however, 
is an economic blockbuster.

<h2>Coffee</h2>
<br><a href="gn_coffee.html">
<img src="img/gn_coffee06d.jpg" alt="Roasted Beans" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Coffea arabica</i>, <i>C. canephora</i> (robusta), <i>C. liberica</i>]
<p>Coffee, which is thought to have originated in Ethiopia, is the 
economic blockbuster of the madder family. Its cultivation has resulted 
in great fortunes, and in great sorrow. Today there is a Fair Trade 
movement to see that beans are from sources that treat the laborers and 
the local community fairly. Coffee now has its own 
<a href="gn_coffee.html"><b>Coffee</b></a> page.

<h2>Gardenia Fruits</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_garden02e.jpg" alt="Gardenia Fruit Pods" class=mrg>
[Cape Jasmine; Chija (Korea); Zhi Zi (China); <i>Gardenia jasminoides</i>]
<p>
Gardenia fruits are used in Korea as a natural yellow food coloring, and 
to dye cloth. A typical culinary use is to give pickled daicon radish 
a bright yellow color. The orange-yellow color is from Crocetin, the same 
substance that is responsible for the color of saffron. Gardenia fruit 
also has a number of medicinal qualities, particularly repressing 
inflamation and helping to control arthritis. The photo specimens were 
purchased at a Korean market in Los Angeles in a 1/2 ounce bag at the 
cost of 2015 US $3.98 per ounce, but lower prices can be found on the 
Internet when buying in larger quantity. They are typically around 
1-1/4 inches long, 5/8 inch diameter and weigh 16 to the ounce.

<h2>Kratom</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_kratom01e.jpg" alt="Young Kratom Plant" class=mrg>
[Ketum; <i>Mitragyna speciosa</i>]
<p>
This Southeast Asian tree can grow to about 82 feet, but the photo shows 
a very young plant. It has a long history of medicinal use in it's native 
region. In North America, some people are using it for relief from 
chronic pain, opium withdrawal, and increasingly as a recreational 
drug.</p>

<p>Kratom has a wide range of side efects, which can become severe, 
even deadly, when it is mixed with other substances. There have 
been more than 16 deaths in the United States between 2014 and 2017, 
though kratom has not been the only factor in any of them. There have 
been some tests on animals, but there have been no clinical trials 
in the United States to verify effectiveness and safety. Kratom is 
illegal to various degrees in a number of countries and is illegal 
in a number of US states. It is illegal in Canada for any ingested 
use, but not for incense or similar applications.

<h2>Lady's Bedstraw</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_ladybs01k.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
[Yellow Bedstraw; <i>Galium verum</i>]
<p>
This low, scrambling perennial herb is native to temperate zones of 
Europe, North Africa and Asia, from England to Japan. It is naturalized 
in Canada, Tasmania, New Zealand and the northern half of the United 
States. It's main use was for stuffing mattresses, because its scent was 
effective against fleas.  Culinarily, it was once used to coagulate milk 
in making cheese, and to color Double Gloucester cheese, for which 
annatto is now used. In Denmark it is still used to color and flavor the 
alcoholic drink Bj&aelig;sk.

<h2>Quinine Bark</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_quina02e.jpg" alt="Fragments of Bark" class=mrg>
[Fever Bark, Jesuit's Bark; <i>Cinchona officinalis</i>, 
<i>C. pubescens</i>, <i>C. ledgeriana</i> and others]
<p>
The powdered bark of Cinchona trees was found by Jesuit priests in South 
America to contain an effective treatment for malaria, quinine. Peru 
and surrounding countries tried to maintain a monopoly, but the English 
and Dutch had a great need for this medicinal in their tropical empires, 
so seeds and cuttings were smuggled out and planted in India, Ceylon 
(Sri Lanka) and Java.</p>
<p>The problem with Quinine was bitterness. To make the medicine more 
palatable, British officers in India mixed it with gin, water, lime juice 
and sugar - the original gin and tonic.</p>
<p>Today, quinine is still the bitter ingredient in tonic water, though 
the allowed amount is well below a therapeutic dose. Most bars, however, 
make a gin and tonic with plain soda water from a hose, unless you 
demand it be made with bottled tonic water. For malaria, quinine has 
been replaced with other drugs. The photo specimens were purchased from 
a market serving a Latin American community in Los Angeles.

<h2>Sweet Woodruff</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_woodr01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
[Sweetscented Bedstraw; Waldmeister (Germany); <i>Galium odoratum</i>]
<p>
This low, scrambling perennial herb is native to temperate zones of 
Europe and Asia, from England to Japan, including parts of western 
Siberia. It is sparsely naturalized in Canada and the northern half of 
the United States. It's main culinary use is in Germany, to flavor May 
wine, beer, brandy, punch, jellies, jams, ice cream, sherbet powder and 
herbal teas. It is also used in Georgia, along with tarragon, to flavor 
the soft drink Tarhun. Versions of this beverage are now also bottled in 
Russia and Estonia, with some apparent plan to bottle or distribute a 
version in the United States.
