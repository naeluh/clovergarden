"Goose" applies to a number of water fowl worldwide, all 
belonging to the subtribe <i>Anserini</i> of the subfamily family 
<i>Anserinae</i> (which includes Swans) of the family<i> Anatidae</i> 
(which includes geese, swans and ducks). They are strong, active birds 
- geese are imperfectly domesticated and swans barely at all - and they 
bite.</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The word for "goose" is rooted in the earliest versions of PIE (Proto 
Indo-European), the language from which English, Latin, Greek, Hindi, 
Lithuanian and many others descend. Clearly they've been significant to 
humans for a very long time.</p>

<p>Domesticated geese belong to the genus <i>Anser</i> (Grey Geese) with 
two main species. In the West they are derived from the Greylag Goose, 
<i>Anser anser</i>, and in the East from the Chinese or Swan Goose 
<i>Anser cygnoides</i>. In both groups white varieties have been developed 
and are preferred in commerce because the skin will be free of dark spots 
from un-emerged feathers. The true White Goose (genus <i>Chen</i>), is a 
North American wild goose unrelated to the domestic goose.</p>

<p>In either lineage, domestic geese are remarkably like the wild geese 
from which they derive, in plumage, strength and fierceness. Geese are 
complex and interesting critters to have around, but some writers have 
anthropomorphized them without mercy. They are geese and their behavior 
must be interpreted as goose-like, not human-like.</p>

<p>Geese are hated by golfers for adding gooey hazards around the already 
annoying water hazards. Geese love golf courses.</p>

<h2 id=breed class=lrg>Types of Geese</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Barnacle Goose</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_goosebn01e.jpg" alt="Barnacle Goose" class=mrg>
[<i>Branta leucopsis</i>]
<p>
This wild goose has an interesting place in European history. Since 
no one had ever seen a baby barnacle goose or an egg (they breed in the 
Arctic), the story got invented that they were actually the mature form 
of the <a href="seabarn.html#goosi"><b>Goose Barnacle</b></a> which 
they were thought to resemble. One cleric even claimed to have seen one 
convert from a barnacle to a goose. For this reason they were classified 
as fish, not as fowl, and the church allowed them to be eaten on meatless 
days.

<h2>Canada Goose</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_goosecn01e.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class=mrg>
[<i>Branta canadensis</i>]
<p>
This is the most well know wild goose in North America. Previously 
overhunted, most subspecies are now recovering due to strict game laws. 
They are migratory, spending the summers in Canada and Alaska and the 
winters in the USA. They are particularly fond of golf courses, for 
which reason golfers hate them intensely. They are present year round 
along the USA / Canada border.
</p>
<p><u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; These geese are very strong and rather fierce. If 
they want your lunch they will take it from you. Best to appreciate them 
from a safe distance.

<h2>Chinese Swan Goose</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_goosech01h.jpg" alt="Chinese Goose" class=mrg>
[<i>Anser cygnoides</i>]
<p>
The Chinese goose is easily identifiable by the big lump in the forehead where 
it joins the beak. These geese are now widely raised in the West as well 
as in China. They are somewhat smaller than the European goose and in my 
experience a lot less fierce. There are both brown and all white varieties 
in domestic flocks.

<h2>Greylag Goose - Domestic Goose</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_goosedg01h.jpg" alt="Greylag Goose" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Anser anser</i>]
</p><p>
The European domesticated goose is descended from the wild Greylag Goose and 
remains much the same in appearance and disposition. There are now quite a 
number of named varieties of this goose varying in size and plumage including 
some that are all white. <u>Caution</u>: these geese are very strong and 
they'll go quite out of their way for a chance to bite you. They bite 
hard, and while they have hold of you they'll beat you black and blue 
with their elbows. Very territorial they are, and their territory is 
wherever they happen to be at the moment.

<h2>Swan</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_swan01e.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Cygnus</i> various species]
<p>
Most Northern Hemisphere swans are all white or nearly so, Southern Hemisphere 
swans are available in a number of color schemes (except all white) including 
the New Zealand black swan. They are generally larger than geese, have 
longer necks and don't venture onto land as much. They are mostly decorative 
and no longer much eaten in Europe or North America due to the lynch mobs that 
would form if people knew you were eating swans.

<h2>Upland Goose</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_gooseup01e.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class=mrg>
[Magellan Goose, <i>Chloephaga picta</i>]
<p>
This is the most common goose in South America and the Falkland Islands - a 
wild goose that's not been domesticated. Upland Geese come in several very 
different color schemes and can be found far inland where they are not 
appreciated by sheep and cattle ranchers due to large flocks feeding on 
the pastures. Studies have shown, though, that they are more beneficial 
than damaging.
