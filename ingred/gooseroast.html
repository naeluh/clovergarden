Roast Goose is very different from roast Turkey. The shape is 
elongated with wing joints bigger than the drumsticks. White meat 
enthusiasts are out of luck - goose comes in "real dark" and 
"even darker". Drying out the breast isn't a problem but toughness can 
be if you pull at too low a temperature. Swan is bigger, but much harder 
to find at your local supermarket.</span>

<h2 id="intro" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> Historical</h2>

<p>Wild geese range throughout the northern hemisphere (southern 
hemisphere geese are a little different) and were domesticated in 
prehistoric times. Unlike domesticated turkeys and chickens though, they 
have not changed much from their wild form or behavior.</p>
<p>In Renaissance Europe geese were on the tables of the middle class 
at festival time while the aristocracy dined on peacock - until the turkey 
came from Mexico and rudely displaced the peacock. Roast goose, however, 
continued as a Christmas feature even unto this day.</p>

<p>Roasting a Goose is less complex than roasting a Turkey for a number of 
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're not going to have to decide whether fresh or frozen because 
  you'll probably only be able to get frozen.</li>
<li>You aren't going to have to ponder size so much because all the market 
  will have is likely around 10 to 12 pounds.</li>
<li>You're not going to have to make decisions about sex (the goose's, not 
  your own - can't help you there) because they aren't labeled by gender.</li>
<li>Salting and/or brining are not needed.</li>
<li>Time and finish temperature aren't as critical because a goose isn't 
  going to end up with cardboard breasts if you run 5 degrees over.</li>
<li>Stuffing isn't as deep so it'll come up to temperature more with the 
  rest of the goose, which is going to go hotter anyway.</li>
<li>Most Americans have never tasted goose so they won't be able to 
  criticize every detail.</li>
<li>Goose roasts to a much darker shade so it's more likely to be even in 
  color.</li>
<li>You are less likely to be expected to produce the full dress American 
  Thanksgiving experience with sides, gravy, trimmings and pie, so you 
  have a lot more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>


<h2 id="equip" class=lrg>Equipment You Will Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <h3>Oven</h3> with good temperature control and sufficient room for the 
  goose and its roasting pan.</li>
<li>A <h3>Roasting Pan</h3>. Highly preferred are shallow pans fitted 
  with a <b>V-rack</b>, and with convenient handles on the pan and the 
  V-rack. These are readily available at prices from $15 to $150. 
  Disposable aluminum pans are way too flimsy for even a duck - a 
  disaster waiting to happen - and they have no rack so the goose will 
  be swimming in grease.</li>
<li><h3>Aluminum Foil</h3>, wide.</li>
<li><h3>Rubber Gloves</h3> - these are for turning the goose over part 
  way through roasting and removing it from the V-rack after roasting. 
  Silicone Rubber oven gloves work fine, but I simply won't pay the price 
  of those Orca things and they're rather stiff anyway. Get the thickest 
  set of flock lined rubber dishwashing gloves they have at your local 
  market in size "extra large". These will do just fine if you are 
  organized and work efficiently.</li>
<li>A <h3>Meat Thermometer</h3> with a probe long enough to penetrate to 
  the center of the goose. Highly recommended is one with a probe on a 
  long cable so you can monitor temperature without opening the oven.
  </li>
<li><h3>Kitchen Twine</h3> and a <b>trussing needle</b> or other method 
  of getting string through skin (<a href="gooseroast.html#02">Note-2</a>).</li>
<li><h3>Bamboo Skewers</h3>.</li>
<li>A <h3>Basting Device</h3>, preferably a good quality bulb baster or 
  some sort of shallow scoop that can get down into the roasting pan 
  with V-rack in place.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="plan" class=lrg>Planning <small>&amp;</small> Buying</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> You'll probably be buying your goose frozen. There just 
isn't a steady enough demand for goose to allow stores to stock fresh 
ones, and even frozen ones are scarce except around Christmas. Buy about 
2 days in advance and stash it in the fridge. It'll be partially thawed 
by time you are ready to cook it. See that the factory vacuum package is 
fully intact so it won't leak on other stuff - if not, contain it.
<p></p>

<h3>Roasting vegetables in the pan:</h3> many traditional recipes call 
for adding potatoes, apples and such to the roasting pan at a particular 
point. I find this to be less than satisfactory for several reasons.
<ul>
<li>You must remove the goose from the oven, remove the rack and pour 
  out the collected fat, then return some of it, add the vegetables, 
  replace the goose and put it back in the oven. Aside from the cooling 
  that happens here the vegetables will cause a flat spot in the 
  temperature rise until they are up to temperature - and there's the 
  clear danger of handling all that hot oil.</li>
<li>A lot more fat will exude from the goose. The vegetables tend to pick 
  up char from the bottom of the pan and become saturated with goose 
  grease. This is much less desirable for today's information workers 
  than it was for hard working peasant farmers.</li>
<li>Timing is hard to judge. If you're an experienced farm cook who cooks 
  goose in your own oven often enough to get the hang of it, maybe it's a 
  good idea. For someone who cooks a couple geese in a lifetime it's not 
  so good an idea. Use your bulb baster to bring out enough goose grease 
  to roast these items in their own pan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stuffing or Dressing?</h3> Dressing is the same as stuffing but 
cooked separately in a casserole with some flavorful stock added to make 
up for not being inside the bird.
<p>Unlike turkey goose is still usually stuffed. It's not such a great 
distance to the center so the stuffing will follow the meat more closely 
in temperature, the goose is going to a higher temperature than turkey 
anyway, and goose adds more flavor to the stuffing than turkey does.

</td>

<ol>
<li>Finish thawing your goose.  When ready to use it you can pull it out, 
  cut away the shrink wrap, and let it finish thawing at cool room 
  temperature or in cold running (or very frequently changed) water 
  (see <a href="gooseroast.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Ideally your goose should have 
  just reached a cool room temperature when you start to stuff it.
  <p></p></li>
<li> Remove the giblets, neck and big lumps of fat when you can - 
  <b>Do Not Discard Fat</b>. Pull out any additional fat you can get at, 
  being careful not to cut or tear the skin. Refrigerate or freeze the 
  giblets and neck to use in your next batch of stock, except the liver 
  which you can fry up in a little goose fat and eat with a sprinkle 
  of lemon juice and salt before anyone else thinks of it.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Cut up the fat, put it in a pan and fry slowly until it is thoroughly 
  rendered. Make sure it doesn't overheat! When the cracklings are getting 
  crisp it's done - the cook gets to eat those. Filter the fat through a 
  sheet of plain undecorated paper towel.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Prepare your stuffing / dressing by whatever recipe you chose to use.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Prepare your roasting pan. Cover the V-rack with aluminum foil and 
  punch a bunch of holes through it at the lowest points so it'll drain 
  well.<p></p></li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Remove the wishbone so the front of the goose will be rounder. This 
  bone is very strong and hard in a goose - you need to place the goose 
  breast side up, pull back the skin and cut around the bone carefully 
  being sure you don't cut through the skin anywhere. when you've freed 
  it at it's center you can pull it forward and down to break it loose 
  at the tips.<p></p></li>
<li>Rinse out your goose and pull out any gookies you can still find in there. 
  Dry it thoroughly with paper towels.<p></p></li>
<li>Rub the goose all over inside and out with a mixture of kosher salt 
  (Diamond Crystal is best for this) and fresh ground pepper. Additional 
  spices and seasonings can be added to the mix. For instance, a 
  particular Lithuanian recipe calls for 2-1/2 teaspoons of Hungarian 
  Paprika and 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds.<p></p></li>
<li>Tie the wings so they're tight against the body with kitchen twine, 
  taking it across the back.<p></p></li>
<li>Heat your stuffing as hot as allows you to still handle it and stuff 
  the goose. Don't stuff too tight as you want heat circulation and many 
  stuffings expand a bit. Note in the photos the goose looks under 
  stuffed going into the oven but is filled out at turn-over time.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Pin the neck skin with a bamboo skewer to close the front. Lace the 
  rear opening to close it (<a href="gooseroast.html#02">Note-2</a>). You may find a 
  couple flat pieces of broken off bone you need to remove to do this. 
  Tie the ends of the legs together so they don't spread and stick out 
  oddly when roasted.<p></p></li>
<li>Place the goose <u>breast side down</u> on the prepared roasting rack.
  Pour two to three cups of water in the pan (depending on pan size) so 
  stuff doesn't burn before the goose starts dripping well. When the oven 
  has reached 425&deg;F/220&deg;C slide the beast in and roast for 25 
  minutes (for an 11 pound goose).<p></p></li>
<li>Turn the oven down to 325&deg;F/160&deg;C.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Pull the goose out (pan and all). With a sharp skewer, puncture a lot 
  of pinholes through the skin on the backside. Put on your rubber gloves, 
  grasp the goose firmly and flip it breast side up. With your skewer 
  punch a whole lot of pinholes through the skin on the breast side.
  <p></p></li>
<li>Slide the goose back into the oven. If you have a cable type 
  thermometer insert the probe into the thickest part of the thigh, not 
  touching bone.<p></p></li>
<li>Continue to roast, basting with pan juices about every 15 to 20 minutes 
  until the goose reaches an internal temperature of around 
  175&deg;F/80&deg;C at the thickest part of the thigh and 
  160&deg;F/75&deg;C in the center of the stuffing (see <a href="gooseroast.html#03">
  Note-3</a> and <a href="gooseroast.html#04">Note-4</a>).<p></p></li>
<li>Pull the goose from the oven. Lift it from the roasting pan (rubber 
  gloves, again) and place it on a platter to catch juices that still 
  come out. Tent loosely with foil and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes 
  before carving. Internal temperatures will rise about 4&deg;F during 
  the resting period<p></p></li>
<li>Get any side dishes that need oven finishing into the oven.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Thawing:</b> Yes, all the books, recipes, cooking articles and 
  "experts" scream <h3><i>"Never Do This!"</i></h3>, but the rabid 
  bacteriophobes at the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) say it's 
  OK. Actual research has proven a cool countertop or cold running water 
  thaw is less risky (on multiple counts) than thawing in the 
  refrigerator, and far easier to time. The "Never Do This" 
  recommendation is based on an FDA decree that has no research whatever 
  to support it. If you find you just won't be ready by time it's thawed, 
  put it back in the fridge <u>before</u> it is completely thawed, 
  making sure it can't touch or drip in anything.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Lacing:</b> is supposed to be done with a trussing needle but I 
  didn't have one, so I used a splicing fid (a rope working tool) left 
  from my sailing days. Worked just fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Finish Temperature:</b> Yes all your thermometers and many of 
  your books and recipes say fowl must go to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C - based 
  on an FDA recommendation. That recommendation was reviewed in 2006 and 
  the FDA could find no supporting data whatever, not even scribbled 
  notes, to support the 180&deg;F recommendation and now agrees with the 
  USDA that 165&deg;F/74&deg;C is perfectly safe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Stuffing Temperature:</b> If it just isn't going to make it 
  before the goose is overcooked, pull the goose, scoop out the stuffing, 
  put it in a casserole and put it back in the oven while the goose rests.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Rubber Glove Removal:</b> To get those slippery gloves off just 
  wash your hands with cleanser with the gloves on, then they won't be 
  slippery, will pull right off and won't need further washing.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 id="carve" class=lrg>Carving your Goose</h2>

<p>Perhaps you're one of those risk takers who carves turkeys at the 
table - well don't try that with a goose. Not unless a comedy routine 
is what you're aiming for.</p>
<p>But a goose should carve similar to a turkey, right? Wrong! The tool 
you need to disassemble a goose is not a carving knife but a sharp, 
maneuverable boning knife, and the whole bird is slipperier than a 
greased pig. One of those 2 pronged carving forks can help but the bird 
is still going to squirm and try to escape.</p>
<p>As with a turkey you start by bending back the thighs and wings so you 
can cut the joints apart. The joints are much tighter than on a turkey 
and take some effort to dislodge.</p>
<p>When cutting from the body the meat clings hard to the 
bones and the bone structure is convoluted and the whole thing is dark 
which makes it more difficult to see what you're doing. Use a small knife, 
not a carving knife.</p>
<p>Once you've disassembled your goose you can slice the breasts and 
other large chunks. The flesh is firm and will slice quite thin without 
breaking up, but a santoku is more appropriate than the long slicing 
knife you'd use for turkey. The first joint of the wing is actually 
larger than the drumstick but the drumsticks have less of a tendon 
problem than with turkey.</p>
<p>Once you've got it all sliced up, arrange the slices on a platter and 
serve.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="safety" class=lrg>Safety Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be prepared to handle dangerous quantities of very hot oil. The roasting 
pan must always be handled with great care lest it spill. Safe and proper 
basting tools should be used.</li>
<li>Do not refrigerate a goose after stuffing, cook immediately.</li>
<li>Observe cooking temperatures given above and take them seriously. Harmful 
bacteria multiply very rapidly at temperatures between 40&deg;F and 140&deg;F, a 
range your goose will be in for most of the cooking time.</li>
<li>When handling an uncooked goose, do not handle any other food until you have 
cleaned up with soap and water.</li>
<li>Do not let an uncooked goose come in contact with any other food.</li>
<li>Immediately upon moving an uncooked goose, scrub the cutting board or 
surfaces it was touching with soap and water and preferably a little bleach. 
I generally scrub everything with cleanser which releases bleach in 
the process.</li>
<li>The USDA recommends that leftovers should be in the refrigerator within 
2 hours of coming out of the oven. In general that's just not going to 
happen but try to keep close. If there are large amounts store in 
multiple smaller batches so the temperature will drop quickly.</li>
