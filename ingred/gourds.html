<h1>Gourds</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>Gourds are members of the family <i>Cucurbitaceae</i> (Cucurbits) 
along with melons, squash and cucumbers.</span> They're all "cucumbers" to 
the botanist and "Vine Crops" to the agriculturist, and the're all fruit 
but in culinary practice gourds are "vegetables".</p>
<p>Gourds are native to Asia and Africa and were unknown in the Americas 
until brought by European traders and invaders after 1500 (some controversy 
here). In any case there were already squash in the Americas that dried to 
hard shells that would be called "gourds" in popular usage, but which 
aren't actually gourds.</p>

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Gourds are not so neatly categorizable as squash and cucumbers, each of 
which belongs to a single genus (with just a couple exceptions). Not only 
are there several distinct genera of gourds but the line between 
gourds and cucumbers is a bit fuzzy, and some gourds are called "melons" 
even though they aren't.</p>
<p>For our discussion here "Gourd" will be any vine fruit belonging 
to family <i>Cucurbitaceae</i> and native to Asia or Africa that is not 
a melon or cucumber - regardless of what they're called in common usage.
</p>
<p>Many recipes for gourds say you can use Zucchini instead. This is 
not actually true, because their cooking characteristics are quite 
different. Squash quickly disintegrates into mush with long cooking, 
while gourds become tender, but keep their shape.</p>

[Winter Melon, White Pumpkin, Wax Gourd, Safed Petha (Hindi), Dong Gua 
(China); Mak ton (Laos); Fuk (Thai); <i>Benincasa hispida</i>]
<p>
This large gourd is popular in China as Winter Melon, both for its 
delicacy when cooked, and because with its waxy coating it can be kept 
well into the winter. In India it's used for sweets and curries. 
Immature melon is sold as <a href="gourds.html#fuzzy"><b>Fuzzy Melon</b></a>.
</p>

<p>The photo specimen is a spherical variety about 10 inches in diameter, 
relatively small so it can be sold whole. The sausage shaped varieties 
can easily top a yard long and 50 pounds.

<h2>Bitter Melon</h2>
<br><h3>[Balsam Pear, Bitter Gourd; Karela (India); Ampalaya (Philippine); 
Ku gua (China), genus <i>Momordica</i>]</h3> &nbsp; 
Actually a gourd, not a mellon, this is one of the most bitter of 
edible vegetables, the bitterness coming from an anti-malarial substance 
similar to quinine. It is reputed for many beneficial medicinal 
properties, particularly treatment of diabetes, but all need further 
study.
<p>Aside from the bitterness, the flavor of this gourd is very 
interesting, and it is popular throughout India, Nepal, China and 
Southeast Asia. While long popular in Okinawa, this gourd has recently 
gained popularity on the main islands of Japan. People are using the 
vines to shade the sun side of their homes, and the gourds are available 
in markets during the Summer, for use in Okinawa style dishes.</p>
<p>Bitter Melon is now also grown in Africa, the Caribbean, and of course 
California. The Chinese variety is always in very good supply here in 
Los Angeles, and the Indian varieties are increasingly available.</p>
<p>The gourds are generally eaten quite green when the seed mass will be 
white. As the gourd ripens fully it turns yellowish, very bitter and less 
crisp. The pulpy arils surrounding the seeds become brilliant red and 
quite sweet. They are popular in salads in Southeast Asia but at this 
point the rest of the melon is of little use.</p>

   <h3>Chinese Bitter Melon</h3>

   <img src="img/gd_bitterch02e.jpg" alt="Chinese Bitter Gourds" class=mrg></a>
   [Ku gua (China); <i>Momordica charantia</i>]
   <p>
   Chinese bitter melons are less bitter than the Indian variety, and seem 
   to be a little less bitter in the larger sizes, such as those in the photo. 
   The top photo specimen was 11-3/4 inches long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and 
   weighed 12-5/8 ounces. As they ripen the pulpy seed surround, which is 
   not bitter, becomes brilliant red and quite sweet, but by time it's at 
   its best the melon is turning yellow and becoming mushy.

   <h3>Indian Bitter Melon</h3>

   <img src="img/gd_karela05k.jpg" alt="Indian Bitter Gourds" class=mrg></a>
   [Karela (India); <i>Momordica charantia</i>]
   <p>
   Indian bitter melons (bottom three in the photo) have a much rougher skin,  
   are more bitter than the Chinese variety, and also come in a white 
   version. They are also more prone to damage and don't keep as well as the 
   Chinese. Miniature Indian bitter melons are popular in India and Southeast 
   Asia for stuffing as individual portions.

   Erumapaval (India); <i>Momordica dioica</i>]
   <p>
   This gourd is used as a vegetable all over India and in some parts 
   of Southeast Asia, thus the many names. Usage is similar to Karala 
   (Indian Bitter Melon), but, though Its flavor is similar to karala, 
   it has only a faint hint of the bitterness. It is commonly fried with 
   spices and often served with meats or fish. This gourd also has 
   medicinal uses.

   [Dahon ng Ampalay&aacute; (Philippines) <i>Momorica charantia</i>]
   <p>
   This green is popular all over Southeast Asia, including the 
   Philippines. It is mildly bitter, similar to the fruit but very much 
   less so. The photo specimens, purchased from an Asian grower at a Los 
   Angeles farmer's market, were from a bundle about 32 inches long. In 
   the lower right quarter you can see a very immature bitter melon 
   fruit. Flowers, if any, are small and yellow.

   <br><a href="gd_bittz.html">
   <img src="img/gd_bittertw02e.jpg" alt="Taiwan Bitter Gourds" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Momordica. charantia</i>]
   <p>
   This melon is similar to the regular Chinese bitter melons but much 
   larger, paler in color and a lot less bitter. In fact, it's hardly 
   bitter at all, so what's the point? These  bitter gourds are good 
   sliced, salted and eaten raw, but they seem a bit bland cooked. 
   Clearly this is considered a prestige vegetable because the melons 
   were individually shrink wrapped and carefully packed. I'm not sure 
   they're    actually grown in Taiwan, the Asian markets around here 
   seem to label a lot of unusual stuff "Taiwan". The top photo 
   specimen was 11 inches long, 3-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 1 
   pound 6-1/2 ounces.

   <p>
   Native to tropical Africa, fruits of this plant are about 2-3/4 inches 
   long and covered with soft spines, which become prickly and sharp 
   when the fruit dries. The leaves are a bit bitter, but cooked as a 
   vegetable in Gabon and Malawi. The fruit is cooked and eaten throughout 
   its range, and the tuberous roots are cooked and eaten in Sudan. All 
   parts of the plant are used medicinally.

   <p>
   Despite the common English name and it's outward and inward appearance, 
   Gac is completely unrelated to the actual 
   <a href="mb_jackz.html"><b>Jackfruit</b>.</a>. It grows on vines 
   like any other gourd or cucumber and has red arils surrounding the 
   seeds just like a ripe <a href="gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter 
   Gourd</b></a> should, but they are very large. This gourd is eaten 
   in Vietnam, combined with glutinous rice in a dish called 
   <i>x&ocirc;i gac</i>. Gac is highly seasonal, available from 
   December into February. The photo specimen was 5-1/4 inches diameter 
   and weighed 2-1/2 pounds.</p>
   <p>Gac has a higher concentration of bioavailable beta-carotene 
   (Vitamin A) than any other fruit or vegetable, 10 times that of 
   carrots, and 70 times the lycopene provided by tomatoes. It is also 
   very high in a number of important phytonutrients and Vitamin E, and 
   the pulp contains a fair amount of oils which efficiently transport 
   these nutrients. It is now being sold in the West in capsule form as 
   a nutritional supplement.

   <p>
   Native to southern China and northern Thailand, this gourd is related 
   to the <a href="gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter Gourds</b></a>, but genus 
   <i>Siraitia</i>, not <i>Momordica</i>). This fruit has recently become 
   much better known in the West. Extracts from this fruit are 300 times 
   sweeter than cane sugar, with almost no calories. The US FDA (Food and 
   Drug Administration) has recently rated the fruit and extracts from it 
   as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), so they can be included as natural 
   sweeteners in any number of products. This sweetener has not yet been 
   shown to have the serious negative effects of artificial sweeteners, 
   but sufficient studies looking for those have yet to be conducted..</p>
   <p>This sweetener has not yet been shown to have the serious negative

<p>
This gourd comes in many shapes and sizes from long and snake like 
to spherical but the form pictured is the one common in Southern 
California markets. They will grow much larger but they get very bitter 
when more mature. Eventually the shell hardens and the gourd becomes 
hollow and may be used as a container or carved decoratively.</p>
<p>Young shoots and leaves are also edible. Dried strips of the gourd 
called Kampyo are important in Japan and often used as edible bindings 
to hold other ingredients together.

This variety of Bottle Gourd started to appear in Los Angeles in 2012. 
In Indian markets it may be sold as "Indian Opo", but in other markets 
it is just plain "Opo". The seeds are a little larger than in the 
long Opos, but cooking characteristics are the same.

<h2>Calabash</h2> - See <a href="gourds.html#bottle"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a>. 
There is also a Calabash that isn't a gourd at all but the large 
spherical fruit of a tree in the <i>Bignonia</i> family (<i>B. Crescentia

   Grown all over Southeast Asia, these have also long been a common 
   vegetable here in Southern California. They are used by Asians of all 
   stripes, from India to the Philippines. Though commonly sold as 
   "Chinese Okra", it is entirely unrelated to Okra and does not resemble 
   it in flavor, texture, cooking properties or size, only in that it has 
   ridges.</p>
   <p>The skin is stiff and thin with sharp ridges running the full 
   length. The flesh is very delicate in both flavor and texture, yet 
   holds its shape well when cooked. The photo specimen was 19 inches 
   long, 2-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 14 ounces. They vary in shape 
   and size. The cut one was more uniform in diameter, 21 inches long

   <p>   
   Probably of South or Southeast Asian origin, these are an eating 
   variety which may be cylindrical or snake shaped with little or no 
   ridging. Cylindrical ones are generally eaten when they are about 8 
   to 10 inches long, snake shaped ones depending on variety. The 
   photo specimen in the center was 11 inches long and 2-1/2 inches 
   diameter.</p>
   <p>These gourds have not yet become common in Southern California 
   markets, but I have found them in Indian markets in Artesia and in 
   large Asian markets in Los Angeles. They have a more distinctly 
   vegetable flavor than the Angled Luffa and store considerably 
   longer. In California they are grown commercially mostly for the bath 
   sponge produced when they mature and dry out. They are also grown in 
   Florida where some may be used for cooking.

   fiber (the papery shell is easily removed). The "sponges" are popular 
   as bath sponges and for various household chores.</p> 
   <p>Luffas should be dried well between uses for longer life. A large 
   one also serves marvelously as a non-injurious club for swatting 
   snoring bed companions in the night. The sponge pictured is about 26 
   inches long. My local market sometimes has them for about $1.39 each 
   but you can pay a lot more for a short piece at an upscale bath

   This Luffa is only about 5 inches long pointed at both ends with spiky 
   skin. It is used as a small sponge and made into massage brushes 
   and sponge gloves, but is more noted for medicinal uses. It has many 
   uses in South American folk medicine and is widely sold in the U.S. in

This gourd is native to Tanzania and northern Mozambique, but is now 
widely cultivated in East and South Africa. It is a climbing vine, and 
bears fruits up to 33 pounds. Flesh of the fruit is edible, but its main 
value is the seeds, which provide both protein and a slightly sweet 
cooking oil (Oyster-nut oil, Ko&eacute;m&eacute; de Zanzibar). The seeds 
can be eaten raw, or boiled, roasted or pickled.  The cake left from 
pressing for oil is rich in fats and protein, and is used for animal feed.

<p>
This tiny relative of the Snake Gourd is an important vegetable in 
Bengal and Uttar Pradesh (north eastern India). They have just started 
becoming available in the Indian markets here in Southern California 
(spring 2013) but are still expensive at about 2013 US $5.99 per pound. 
They were formerly only available canned, but availability fresh is 
still very erratic.</p>
<p>These gourds can grow to 6 inches long but are harvested immature at 
between 2 and 3 inches. The photo specimens were typically 2-1/2 inches 
long and 1.2 inches diameter. The seeds are larger and more mature than 
in other edible gourds and are a bit crunchy, but since these gourds are 
often stuffed or sliced, the seeds are usually removed. The skin is very 
thin but a little hard, so they are most often scraped. Cooked taste was 
pleasant, but not really distinctive. I'd not seek these out at the 
price - but then, I'm not from there.

var <i>anguina</i>]
<p>
This gourd is popular in Southern India and Southeast Asia. It comes in 
various colors, sizes and shapes, growing to as long as 6 feet, and in 
Asia is often seen with a rock tied to the tip to keep it growing 
straight. Shoots and leaves are also eaten as a vegetable.</p>
<p>The flesh of this gourd is similar to the <a href="gd_luffaz.html">
<b>Luffa</b></a> and <a href="gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a>, 
and like them will hold its shape when cooked. Unlike the other two, the 
seed mass of the Snake Gourd is loose and fluffy and is usually removed. 
Snake gourd is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.

<h2>Pork Fat Nut</h2>

[Lard Seed; Akar kepayang (Malay); <i>Hodgsonia macrocarpa</i> &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; <i>H. heteroclita</i>]
<p>These gourds, of the same tribe as the Parval and Snake Gourds 
above, but quite different in makeup, are native to the eastern 
Himalayas, Yunan, China and Assam in the far northeast of India. These 
vines produce fibrous fleshed fruit weighing about 4 pounds. The 
more commonly used <i>H. macrocarpa</i> is lighter in color and lacks 
the pumpkin-like sutures of <i>H. heteroclita</i> in the watercolor. 
Each fruit has up to 8 large seeds which have a 50% fat content. They 
are suspected of being slightly toxic raw, but are generally roasted 
or otherwise cooked before use. Roasted, they taste like fatty pieces 
of pork. In Assam these nuts are used in curries. The flesh is not 
considered edible. Cooking oil can be pressed from the seeds, which is 
also used medicinally, as are other parts of the plant.

<p>
Native to India, this gourd is popular in the cuisines of Northern India 
and Pakistan. It's becoming more common in Southern California and is 
seasonally available in markets that have a significant Indian / Pakistani 
element in their clientele. The gourd is eaten in an immature stage when 
it will be about 3 inches in diameter and tender with skin that does not 
need to be peeled. Seeds of more mature gourds are also eaten.

Goli, Kundri, Kundru, Kunduzi, Kowai, Kovai, Donda, Dondakaya 
(India); <i>Coccinia grandis</i>]
<p>A popular vegetable in India, this tiny gourd can now be found in Indian 
markets in California and elsewhere. Here it is always sold green, looking 
very much like a tiny cucumber, but in India it is also sometimes used in 
it's scarlet red mature stage.</p>
<p>Tindora can be eaten raw and are a lot more crunchy than cucumbers, or they 
may be cooked as a side dish or may be pickled. When pickled they are  
sometimes called "gherkin" but are easy to tell from the real 
<a href="ck_gherkz.html">Gherkin</a> and from cucumber gherkins by 
their smooth skin. Typically they are between 2-1/2 and 3-1/4 inches long, 
3/4 to 7/8 inch diameter and weigh around 5/8 ounce.
