<h1>Grapes</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Grapes (Genus <i>Vitis</i> of family <i>Vitaceae</i>) are the only 
culinary members of the entire order <i>Vitales</i> of clade 
<i>Rosids</i>, though some other members are medicinal. Grapes have been 
cultivated and wine made from them for so long some archaeologists 
suggest wine making as a major incentive for humans to start living in 
permanent settlements. Fermented intoxicants are much enjoyed by humans, 
bears and elephants. Grape leaves are also important as wrappers for 
snacks and appetizers.

</ul>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Cultivation of grapes probably began around 8000 years ago in Anatolia 
and Caucasus. The oldest known production winery found in Armenia, is 
about 6000 years old, but too sophisticated to be something new. Wine 
production had spread all through the Mediterranean region and as far as 
India by historical times. The city of Shiraz, in Persia, was a major 
wine production region until the 19th century, but as Radical Islam 
replaced Civilized Islam through the Near and Middle East, production 
ceased. Australian Shiraz wine is not related.</p> 
<p>Today, due to modern transportation fresh table grapes can be enjoyed 
far and wide, all year long. When they're out of season in California, 
they are brought in from Chile.</p>
<p>The two major species are <i>V. vinifera</i>, native to Europe, and 
<i>V. labrusca</i>, native to North America. Other species are of local 
interest only, except <i>V. californica</i> which is used worldwide as a 
robust root stock for wine grapes.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>The varieties shown here are just a few of the hundreds grown world-wide, 
but are those easily available in Southern California. With the exception 
of the Concord variety, grown in more northerly climates, California is by 
far the largest producer of grapes in North America. The many California 
and European wine grape varieties are not listed here because they are 
not generally available in markets.</p>

<h2>Black Finger Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_finger02h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Black Finger Grapes" class=mrg>
[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>I first found these grapes in a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel). They are seedless, moderately sweet, moderately tart, 
and fairly firm. They were typically 1.65 inches long by 0.64 inch 
diameter, weighing 1/4 ounce each, sold for 2019 US $1.69 / pound.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Black Seedless Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_blksless02h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Black Seedless Grapes" class=mrg>
[#4056; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
These large, dark purple, lightly sweet, lightly flavored seedless grapes are 
not nearly as common here in Southern California as the red and white seedless 
varieties. The most common, Black Beauty, has a short season so even though 
grown in both California and Chile, they are not available all year. The 
photo specimens were purchased in Los Angeles in June, and came from Chile. 
They are typically up to 1 inch diameter by 1.4 inches long.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Champaign White / Champaign Red Grapes</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_champw03h.jpg" alt="Bunch of White Champaign Grapes" class=mrg>
<img src="img/gp_champr06h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Red Champaign Grapes" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
</p><p>
These are not actually the grapes used to make Champaign wine, they are 
called "Champaign" because their small size reminded someone of the bubbles 
in Champaign. They are a common seedless table grape here in Southern 
California  - but they seem to be getting bigger lately as growers select 
for size, as they do with everything else around here.  The photo specimens 
were about 0.50 inch diameter for the white, 0.63 diamater for the red.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Concord Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_concor01h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Concord Grapes on Vine" class=mrg>
[<i></i> (fox grapes)]
<p>
The Concord Grape variety was developed in 1849 and is the dominant native 
North American grape in commerce. While primarily a North American grape 
it is suspected of having some <i>Vitis vinifera</i> (European) content 
in its genetic makeup. It is large, very deeply purple with a dusty white 
blush on the outside and is a seeded type. It is adapted to cooler weather 
and is grown extensively from New England to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Concords are rarely sold as table grapes because seedless varieties 
are preferred for that use, but they are much used for grape jelly, grape 
juice and to make sweet kosher wine. It's deep purple color has become 
signatory of these products.  Concords are slip-skin grapes, meaning they 
are easy to squeeze out of their skins.

<h2>Flame Red Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_flamered02h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Flame Red Grapes" class=mrg>
[#4023; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
This is a very common, medium sweet, seedless red table grape grown in 
California in great quantity. It is valued for heavy yield and fruit which 
is durable in storage and transportation.  It is a hybrid of Thompson 
Seedless and several other <i>V. vinifera</i> species (yes, grape developers 
have some tricky ways to hybridize with seedless grapes). The photo 
specimens were abut 0.8 inch diameter. Their season is May to December, 
alternating with similar Ruby types in season from August to February.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Kyoho Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_kyoto03h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Kyoho Grapes" class=mrg>
[Kyoho budo; <i>Vitis vinifera x Vitis labrusca</i>]
<p>
This grape has been grown in Japan since 1937 but got its current name, 
meaning "giant mountain grapes" only in 1946. They are very sweet with  
intense grape flavor, and are just mildly tart, with large seeds. Like 
the Concord, they are a slip-skin grape, and in Asia they are normally 
eaten without the skin. Being a Western barbarian, I eat them skin and 
all. They are popular in Japan, Korea and parts of China, but are also 
grown in California and Chile. The photo specimens were purchased at a 
farmer's market in Los Angeles and were about 0.93 inch diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pearlette Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_pearl02h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Pearlette Grapes" class=mrg>
[#4022; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
This is a popular white seedless table grape. It's in season from May through 
July, after which the Thompson Seedless takes over. This grape is mildly tart 
with good flavor. The photo specimens were about 0.81 inch diameter. They are 
easy to tell from the Thompson because they are nearly spherical, while the 
Thompson is elongated.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Red Globe Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_redglob06h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Red Globe Grapes" class=mrg>
[#4636; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
This large seeded table grape is in color between red and green, and also 
has a rather light flavor. It is common in Southern California produce markets, 
but most production from California and Australia is exported to Japan, where 
it is very popular. Requiring a long growing season it is not a practical 
variety in most regions. The photo specimens were 0.93 inch 
diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sour Grapes</h2>
<br><a href="gp_verjz.html">
<img src="img/gp_sour09h.jpg" alt="Bunches of Sour Grapes, large and small" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
Before vinegar production was perfected, verjuice, squeezed from unripe 
grapes, was a major souring ingredient in Europe. It is essential for 
accurately reconstructing Medieval and Renaissance recipes. It is now a 
"gourmet" item in Australia, and still much used in Anatolia, Caucasus, and 
the Near and Middle East. Due to our large communities from those regions 
here in Southern California, unripe grapes are widely available in produce 
markets when in season (June, July).  The two bunches in the photo show 
the extremes of size (0.28 to 0.65 inch diameter) - they may be anywhere 
in between.&nbsp; <a href="gp_verjz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sugraone / Autumn Seedless</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_sugra03h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Sugraone Grapes" class=mrg>
[#4497; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
This grape is significantly more tart than most popular seedless grapes. 
The photo specimens were about 0.85 inch diameter. Purchased in Southern 
California in late June, 2013.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Thompson Seedless Grape</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_thomps02h.jpg" alt="Bunch of Thompson Seedless Grapes" class=mrg>
[Sultana; #4022; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
These very popular mildly sweet white seedless table grape originated 
in Anatolia and were originally imported from the Ottoman Empire. 
Thompsons are the most heavily planted grapes in California because they 
can be used three ways: raisins, table grapes and wine grapes.

<p>Nearly all raisins sold in North America come from California, and 
nearly all are made from Thompson Seedless grapes. For details see 
<a href="gp_grape.html#raisin">Raisins</a>. California Chablis wine is made primarily 
from this grape, thus is a "California varietal" and not a real Chablis, 
which can only be made in a specific region of France and from Chardonnay 
grapes. The photo specimens were abut 0.68 inch diameter and 0.90 
inches long. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="raisin">Raisins</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_raisin03h.jpg" alt="Golden and Dark Raisins" class=mrg>
[Sultanas; <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
Raisins are simply dried grapes. They come in two forms, Golden and Dark. 
Both forms are made from the same white grapes, generally Thompson 
Seedless. Naturally dried raisins are dark. The Golden ones are made by 
use of Sulphur Dioxide, or by an accelerated drying process. Nearly all 
raisins sold in North America are grown, dried and packaged in 
California, made from Thompson Seedless grapes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="zante">Zante Currants</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_zante01h.jpg" alt="Zante Currants" class=mrg>
[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
Often called simply "currants", and specified in recipes as such, these 
are not related to the botanical Currants, which are 
<a href="sx_saxif.html">Saxifrages</a>, not grapes, and not 
commercially available in North America. These are simply tiny Black 
Corinth grapes (an ancient Greek variety) dried into raisins. Nearly 
all sold in North America are grown, dried and packaged in California.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="leaf">Grape Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/gp_leaf03e.jpg" alt="Fresh Grape Leaves" class=mrg>
[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
<p>
Grape leaves are used as mildly tart food wrappers in the cuisines of 
Turkey, Armenia, Greece, Bulgaria, Rumania, Vietnam and the Arab region. 
Produce markets here in Southern California often have them fresh, but they 
are also widely available brined and packed in jars.</p>
<p>Fresh leaves are rolled up around a cylinder of stuffing, often seasoned 
rice, meat, or a combination of the two, and steamed.The photo specimens, 
purchased from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles in June, were about 
6-1/2 inches wide. 
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Grape Seed Oil</h2>
<br><img src="img/oi_grape03k.jpg" alt="Dish of Grapeseed Oil" class=mrg>
[<i>Vitis vinifera</i>]<p>
Grapeseed oil is now commonly available, at least here in California. 
Its nutral taste makes it very suitable for salad dressings and similar 
uses. It is also a very high temperature oil with a smoke point of 
480&deg;F/250&deg;C. Unfortunately it is also very high in 
polyunsaturated fats (mostly linoleic acid), but the rancidity problem 
is somewhat relieved by a high content of protective vitamin E and other 
antioxidants. It should not be a problem when used for relatively short 
duration frying jobs without re-use. For details see our 
<a href="oilchart.html">Oil Composition &amp; Smoke Point</a> page and 
our <a href="oilshealth.html">Oils, Fats &amp; Health</a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="verj">Verjuice</h2>
<br><a href="gp_verjz.html">
<img src="img/so_verjus2k.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Verjuice" class=mrg></a>
Not vinegar, but used in a similar way, verjuice is the juice of unripe 
grapes. It is essential for reconstructing Medieval and Renaissance recipes 
from before vinegar production was reliable. It used to be almost 
impossible to find in the U.S. but is now being turned out by California 
wineries.
<p>The photo specimen was made by me from unripe grapes purchased from a 
multi-ethnic market serving Anatolian, Caucasian and Near and Middle Eastern 
communities. The grapes were simply ground up in a food processor, strained 
and frozen for future use. It is very sour and somewhat fruity. &nbsp;
