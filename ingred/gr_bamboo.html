<h1>Bamboo</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
family <i>Poaceae</i> (true grasses), subfamily <i>Bambusoideae</i>, 
tribe <i>Arundinarieae</i>, <i>Phyllostachys</i></p>
<p>
Bamboo, the largest of the grasses, can exceed 100 feet tall. A 
vigorous grower, it spreads aggressively by underground runners, but 
every so often a bamboo forest will bloom, go to seed and die. China 
recently (2002 - 2005) had to do a mass relocation of pandas because 
their forest was blooming and the pandas would starve.</p>
<p>Like many other grasses, bamboo stems are hollow and jointed, but 
unlike most grasses they branch with slender leaves on the branches 
rather than blades from the stem. All parts of bamboo are heavily laced 
with toxic cyanide. It isn't known how pandas and lemurs consume so much 
cyanide and live.

</ul>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>History <small>&amp;</small> General Information</h2>

<p>Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on Earth. It can grow well over 
three feet per day and has been clocked at over three feet per <u>hour</u> 
in short spurts. Most are much smaller but some giant timber bamboo can 
grow to over 100 feet tall.</p>

<p>Bamboo stems are hard flexible and durable, so they have been made 
into tools and utensils and used as building materials since long before 
the dawn of history. Their utility has been both enhanced and limited by 
their hollow jointed nature and thin walls, but modern processes and 
bonding methods have recently made bamboo practical for durable flooring, 
cutting boards and other non-traditional uses.</p>

<p>Bamboo propagates by sending out underground runners which send up 
shoots that develop into mature grass stems. These tender young shoots 
are the only part of the bamboo plant that can be made edible to  
humans. "Spreading" bamboos can become pests, as their runners are long 
and they send them out aggressively. "Clumping" bamboos are fairly 
easy to control as their runners are very short and not so aggressive.
</p>

<p>Pandas and golden lemurs have evolved ways to process cyanide and can 
ingest enough bamboo to kill several men each day, but even young shoots 
are too toxic for human consumption. Shoots must first have the fibrous 
exterior sheaths stripped off and must then be cooked well in boiling 
water, uncovered to let the bitter cyanide escape.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>Of the hundreds of varieties of bamboo, only a few are used for food 
and fewer are available commercially. The obvious difference is size, 
but there are other differences. Once peeled and detoxified shoots may 
be sold fresh in bags or in sterile vacuum packs for longer keeping, or 
can be canned whole, sliced or shredded. Bamboo may also be dried, dried 
and salted, pickled, or frozen.</p>

<h2>Bamboo Shoots <small>&amp;</small> Tips</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_bbmix02d.jpg" alt="A mix of Bamboo Shoots" class=mrg>
With no other descriptor, bamboo shoots tend to be  
slightly yellow in color and 2 to 3 inches in diameter, similar to the 
ones in the center left and bottom right of the photo. If canned they, 
will usually be sliced in some fashion, generally into either lengthwise 
slices or small slivers.
<p>Canned are still the most commonly available but markets serving 
Asian communities now stock various kinds in sterile vacuum bags. 
The vacuum bags have the advantage that you can see exactly what you're 
getting, whole shoots can be bagged, and the flavor is much fresher than 
canned. Canned bamboo shoots should be briefly par boiled to remove the 
tinny taste.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Fresh Bamboo Shoots</h2>[probably <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>]
<br><a href="gr_bbfrshz.html">
<img src="img/gr_bbfrsh07d.jpg" alt="Fresh Bamboo Shoots, whole, peeled and cut" class=mrg></a>
[probably <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>]
<p>
Unprocessed bamboo shoots are now often available in Southern California. 
While more trouble to prepare, the flavor of fresh bamboo is superior to 
vacuum bagged and a lot superior to canned. The photo specimens are a 
little old. Preferably they should be no darker than the photo specimens. 
From the shape and structure of the edible shoot, I identify this as 
<i>P. edulis</i>. The photo specimen at the top was 8 inches long, 
3-1/4 inches diameter at the base (average, they are always oval) and 
weighed 1 [pimd 5-7/8 ounces. For preparation see 
<a href="gr_bbfrshz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Prepared Bamboo Shoots, Bulk</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbtub02d.jpg" alt="Large Prepared Bamboo Shoots" class=mrg>
[Mang Xoay (Viet); probably <i>Bambusa oldhamii</i> (giant timber 
bamboo) or <i>Bambusa odashimae</i> (very similar)]
<p>
These are now available in many markets serving East Asian populations, 
sold bulk out of water filled tubs or loosely bagged. Larger stores may 
have them whole, sliced and slivered. They have only been peeled and 
boiled long enough to detoxify them - basically the same as if you 
prepared your own fresh bamboo shoots. They are prepared and boiled in 
Asia, then shipped to North America in sterile bulk packaging.</p>
<p>Flavor is very good but they are perishable - refrigerate and use 
within a few days of purchase. If you have to keep them longer, boil 
them for a few minutes and seal in a plastic bag while still hot. The 
whole photo specimen was 5-1/4 inches long, 2-1/2 inches diameter and 
weighed 8-3/8 ounces. Many in the tub it was drawn from were quite a bit 
larger. They were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2017 US $1.39 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Winter Bamboo</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbwint02f.jpg" alt="Winter Bamboo Shoots, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Moso Bamboo; <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>]
<p>
These are from a giant bamboo that grows to nearly 100 feet tall. They 
are harvested in the winter when they are smaller, but sweeter and more 
tender than the "Hairy" spring shoots, which are used mostly for drying. 
They are a very white color and very large in size. Otherwise they're 
pretty much like other bamboo shoots. Today they are generally sold 
whole in sterile vacuum bags.</p>
<p>The largest of the photo specimens was 
5 inches long, 3-1/2 inch diameter at the base (average, they are oval), 
and weighed 1 pound 3-3/4 ounces.  The photo specimens were purchased 
in individual vacuum bags from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2017 US $1.99 each (about $1.61 / pound).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Green Bamboo Shoots</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbgrn02d.jpg" alt="Green Bamboo Shoots, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[possibly <i>Phyllostachys atrovaginata</i> or <i>P. virella</i>]<p>
These shoots are white, but from a variety of bamboo called "Green 
Bamboo". I always keep these bamboo shoots on hand, because the shrink 
packages contain only about 10.5 ounces, enough for most recipes, but 
not too much, and they are tender, non-fibrous and with good flavor. 
They are often solid, as in the split photo specimen to the right, so 
can be easily cut into whatever shape you want. They are, however, sold 
at a premium price. The whole one to the left was 2-3/4 inches high and 
2-1/4 inches wide, weighing 4-1/4 ounce, nearly as large as they get. 
They were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San 
Gabriel) for 2017 US $3.95 / pound. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=slim>Thin Bamboo Shoots</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbthin01d.jpg" alt="Thin Bamboo Shoots" class=mrg>
[possibly <i>Fargesia spathacea </i> or <i>Phyllostachys bambusoides</i>]
<p>
These bamboo shoots are long and very slender, though if from <i>P. 
bambusoides</i> the mature plant is quite large, to 72 feet tall.
These shoots may be in vacuum packs or canned. The shoots are a bit more 
fibrous than the larger shoots and have a more distinct and slightly 
bitter flavor. The photo specimens were around 6 inches long, 5/8 inch 
diameter and weighed 5/8 ounce each. They were purchased in a 7 ounce 
package from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2017 
US $2.72 per pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Bamboo Tips, Bulk</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbtips02f.jpg" alt="Large Bamboo Tips" class=mrg>
[Mang Cay (Viet); probably Bambusa oldhamii (giant timber bamboo) or 
Bambusa odashimae (very similar)]
<p>
These are from the growing tips of more mature stems, similarly to palm 
hearts. They are very edible with good bamboo shoot flavor, and firm 
but not hard texture from end to end. These may be almost solid, like 
the cut specimen, or may have fairly large cavities.</p>
<p>Tips are available only from the bulk tubs, because of their size. 
The largest photo specimen was 13 inches long, 1-1/2 inches diameter and 
weighed 10 ounces, but many in the tub it was drawn from were quite a bit 
larger. They were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2017 US $1.39 per pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Dried Bamboo, Salted</h2>
<br><a href="gr_bbdryz.html">
<img src="img/gr_bbdrys02d.jpg" alt="Salted Bamboo Shoots with  traditional packaging" class=mrg></a>
[possibly <i>Fargesia spathacea </i> or <i>Phyllostachys bambusoides</i>]
<p>
This traditional product was packaged in the traditional manner, in a  
bamboo splint basket lined with dried bamboo leaves. Of course, this is 
the 21st century, so the product inside was in a plastic vacuum pack 
bag. Most exporters dispense with the traditional packing and just ship 
them in standard modern vacuum packages, but this drying method has 
been pretty much superseded by the Unsalted Dried Bamboo form (see 
below).</p>
<p>This product is made from <a href="gr_bamboo.html#slim">Thin Bamboo Shoots</a> 
dried and preserved with salt. They need to be soaked in a couple 
changes of water before use. The photo specimen was purchased from a 
large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2017 US $9.99 for the 
package, containing 2 pounds 3 ounces of the product ($4.56 per pound). 
Ing: Bamboo shoots, salt, sodium dehydroacetate.

<h2>Dried Bamboo, Unsalted</h2>
<br><a href="gr_bbdryz.html">
<img src="img/gr_bbdry02d.jpg" alt="Large and Thin Dried Bamboo Shoots" class=mrg></a>
[probably Moso Bamboo; <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i> (large) and 
<i>Fargesia spathacea </i> or <i>Phyllostachys bambusoides</i> (thin)]
<p>
Most dried bamboo in the markets here in Los Angeles are of this form, 
whether wide, thin or sliced. They are always treated with sulphur 
dioxide or another sulfite to preserve and maintain color, as is most 
dried fruit sold in North America. Some of these products, especially 
from China are an almost garish yellow in color. Of the photo specimens, 
the large were from Vietnam and the small from China. The largest wide 
piece was 11 inches long and weighed 3 ounces.

<h2>Smoke Dried Bamboo Shoots</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bambsmk01c.jpg" alt="Strips of Smoke Dried Bamboo Shoot Strips" class=mrg>
[Malewa (Uganda)]
<p>
In eastern Uganda, near the mountains, there are bamboo forests. In that 
region bamboo shoots have long been sliced and smoke dried similarly to 
fish. They were originally used directly for food, but now are mainly 
cooked into a sauce with sesame seeds or peanuts. The photo specimens 
were about 20 inches long. The strips are boiled to clean them. The 
joints are then cut out and the sections between the joints are cut into 
small pieces. Peanut paste or sesame seed paste and salt are added and 
the sauce is simmered until tender.

<h2>Sour Bamboo Shoots</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bbpkl01d.jpg" alt="Slices of Pickled Bamboo Shoots" class=mrg>
[Pickled Bamboo Shoots; Naw Mai Dong (Thai); Menma (Japan)]
<p>
In Southeast Asia, Korea, and parts of China, salt fermented bamboo 
shoots are quite popular for use as a flavoring ingredient in soups 
and other recipes. The photo specimens, from Thailand, were shaved 
about 0.080 inch thick (2 mm), in random size and shape, from a fairly  
large bamboo shoot. A 32 ounce jar will have about 6-7/8 ounces of 
bamboo shoot after draining and wringing out. This is about 1 cup lightly 
packed. A 32 ounce jar (mostly water) was purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $2.39. Ing: bamboo shoot, 
water, salt, citric acid, sodium benzoate, sodium metabisulfite.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Bamboo Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_bamblf02f.jpg" alt="Bundle of Bamboo Leaves" class=mrg>
Dried Bamboo Leaves are sold in bundles for use as food wrappers. They 
need substantial soaking to soften them before use. The photo examples 
were 18 inches long by 3-1/4 inches wide. They were bundled with an 
equal number of bamboo leaf stems for use in tying the wrappers, as the 
bundle itself was tied. These were purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel).
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Do not attempt to eat unprocessed bamboo shoots until they have been 
peeled of their leafy sheath and simmered for sufficient time to drive 
off their toxic cyanide. They are unlikely to kill you, but they could 
make you uncomfortable. Commercially prepared products have already 
been detoxed, and are usually labeled "poached" or "boiled".</p>

<p>Bamboo shoots have almost no fat, and are low in calories and sugar, 
but have a fair amount of protein and are high in fiber. They have 
significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin E, thiamin, 
riboflavin, niacin, folate and pantothenic acid. They also include 
minerals calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, zinc, 
copper, manganese, selenium and iron.</p>
