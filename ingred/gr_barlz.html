<h1>Barley</h1>
<br><img src="img/gr_barley05g.jpg" alt="Various forms of Barley" class=mrg>
[Damai (China); <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]
<p>
Barley was first domesticated in the Near East with the earliest find 
being in Syria dated to around 7000 BCE. Beer has been made from it since 
about then. It has been grown in Korea from around 1400 BCE. Tibet 
started growing barley around 450 CE. Made into a toasted flour product 
called <i>tsampa</i>, it is still the most important staple in that 
region.</p>

<p>Barley comes in two varieties, two row and six row. The six row is 
higher in protein and used primarily as animal feed. The two row is 
higher in sugar and is used more for human consumption. Note that barley 
does contain the protein gluten, not enough to make leavened bread, but 
enough to harm a person with Celiac Disorder.</p>

<p>While it was an important staple in early cultures, the most important 
use for barley today is in the making of beer. Well, maybe actually it 
always has been - some archaeologists think agriculture was started 
mainly for reliable production of beer and wine. The earliest finds seem 
associated with ceremonial sites, wine presses and brewing equipment.
English and German beers are made from malted two row barley. 
American beers were traditionally made from six row barley but both 
varieties are used today. Pardon me a moment - I have to refill my 
beer mug. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There, that's better.</p> 

<p>The photo shows barley as harvested on the right, hulled and 
very lightly pearled in the center, and to the left the heavily 
pearled form generally found in North American supermarkets.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; All the forms of barley in the photo at the 
top of this page are available in Southern California, though the 
grain in the husk will be more difficult to find (I probably got it 
from an Indian market). The lightly pearled, which I most often use, 
is easily available in the multi-ethnic markets here in Southern 
California.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The lightly pearled grain is probably the most 
perishable, but I've found it still good in a year's time.  Barley 
Flour, however, should be refrigerated and used within 4 months.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Lightly and fully pearled Barley are both used 
in soups and stews, but have rather different cooking properties. The 
lightly pearled has more grain flavor and takes a little longer to cook, 
but the heavily pearled is more of a problem because it tends to stick 
to the bottom of the pot and burn.

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small>Nurtrition</h3> &nbsp; Barley is a rich 
source of Protein, Dietary Fiber, Niacin, Vitamin B6, and includes a 
number of dietary minerals, particularly Manganese and Phosphorus. It 
is 78% Carbohydrates, 1% Fats, 10% Protein and 10% Water. Like other 
grains, barley has plenty of proteins, but they are not complete for 
human needs, so they need to be equaled out with legumes, or by some 
other way. Barley contains gluten - not enough to produced leavened 
bread, but enough to injure celiacs.<p></p>


<h2>Tsampa</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_tsamp02e.jpg" alt="Freshly Ground Tsampa" class=mrg> 
This is the most important staple of the Tibetan people - Barley that has 
been soaked, dried just damp, roasted golden, and ground. We have a 
recipe, <a href="../recipes/zig_tsamp1.html"><b>Tsampa</b></a>, for 
making modest batches in a home kitchen.

<p>The traditional method of making Tsampa is a day long process, usually 
starting with a 25 pound (or larger) bag of hulled Barley. It is soaked, 
and roasted mixed with sand for even heating, then the sand is sieved out 
before the barley is winnowed of chaff and ground.

<h2>Barley Flakes</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_barlflk02e.jpg" alt="Barley Flakes" class=mrg> 
This product is made similarly to Rolled Oats, and used similarly as a 
quick cooking cereal. To make these, whole hulled oats are steamed and 
then rolled flat and lightly toasted to stabilize them. They are used 
as a breakfast cereal, as a content in granola bars, etc.
