<h1>Bamboo Shoots, Dried</h1>

[Mang Kho (Viet); Menma (Japan)]
<p>
Dried bamboo shoots are of two types. Traditionally they were heavily 
salted during drying. While the salted are still available, due to new 
technology, most dried bamboo shoots in the markets here in Los Angeles 
are of the unsalted form, whether wide, thin or sliced. They are always 
treated with sulphur dioxide or another sulfite to preserve them and 
maintain color, as is most dried fruit sold in North America.</p>
<p>Some of these products, especially from China, are an almost garish 
yellow in color. Of the photo specimens, the large were from Vietnam 
and the small from China. The largest wide piece was 11 inches long 
and weighed 3 ounces.

Dried Bamboo and Fresh Bamboo are different things, and not 
interchangeable with each other. Dried Bamboo has a chewy meaty texture 
and some sweetness, contrasting to the crisp texture and light flavor of 
fresh bamboo. Dried is much valued in Vietnam for the perfumy effect it 
has on broths and soups. In general, strips cut from medium size, 
lighter colored bamboo shoots are recommended for shorter soaking and 
faster cooking.</p>

<p>The salted form, shown in the photo to the left, is prepared 
pretty much the same as the unsalted, with a couple changes of the 
initial soaking liquid. It is milder and more grassy in flavor than 
the unsalted form.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Pretty much any market serving a Southeast 
or East Asian community will have these, usually several brands, shapes 
and sizes. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel). The large, in an 8 ounce package, for 
2017 US $8.58 per pound, while the thin, in a 6 ounce package, were at 
2017 US $10.10 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Tightly sealed in a plastic bag, these shoots 
will last at least a year stored away from sunlight and heat.

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Dried bamboo will expand to two or three times the 
dried volume when fully soaked.  Two or three ounces of dried is 
sufficient for most recipes.

<ol>
<li>Rinse the Dried Bamboo well, and wring it out as best you can.</li>
<li>Place in a bowl and cover with water, 2 or so inches above the 
  Bamboo. Set aside for at least 6 hours. If the water turns cloudy, 
  change it with fresh.</li>
<li>Drain Bamboo well and wring it out.</li>
<li>Put Bamboo in a pot with plenty of water to cover well. Bring to a 
  boil, then keep at a simmer for 1 hour. Drain, rinse and wring out. 
  Return Bamboo to the pot, cover with fresh water, bring to a boil 
  and simmer another 1 hour. Drain rinse and wring out.</li>
<li>Cut off and discard any parts that are very tough. Some chewiness 
  is OK as it will be cooked further in the recipe.</li>
<li>Cut as appropriate for your recipe. Soaked Bamboo can be stored in 
  the fridge for a couple of days, or frozen for longer storage.</li>
