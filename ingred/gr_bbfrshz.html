<h1>Bamboo Shoots, Unprocessed</h1>

[probably <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>]
<p>
Unprocessed bamboo shoots are now often available in Southern 
California. While more trouble to prepare, the flavor of fresh bamboo 
is superior to vacuum bagged and a lot superior to canned. The photo 
specimens are a little old. Preferably they should be no darker than 
the photo specimens. From the shape and structure of the edible shoot, 
I identify this as <i>P. edulis</i>. The photo specimen at the top was 
8 inches long, 3-1/4 inches diameter at the base (average, they are 
always oval) and weighed 1 [pimd 5-7/8 ounces.</p>

The shape and internal structure is much the same as the much large 
Winter Bamboo, and quite different from the other available bamboo 
shoots, so I have tentatively identified it as smaller sprouts of 
<i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>. This specimen is different at the tip 
because edible sheath bases have been left on.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can often be had from the large Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles. Price varies from 2017 US $2.99 to $3.99 
per pound, depending on market. Ideally, the color should be lighter 
than the photo specimen. Examine the bottom, the less dried out the 
better, but there definitely should be no trace of mold.<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, don't. They're already a bit 
old by time they get here, but can be held a day or two at room 
temperature, or a little longer loosely bagged and refrigerated.

<h3>Prep:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cut about 1/4 inch off the bottom.</li>
<li>Strip off all the brown sheaths as has been done to the examples. 
  Sheaths at the tip with no brown can be left.</li>
<li>I usually then cut them in half lengthwise to expose the chambers 
  and speed detox.</li>
<li>Put them in a pot with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, then keep 
  at a fast simmer for about 20 minutes, uncovered so the cyanide can 
  escape easily. No, it isn't going to gas you to death if you're 
  boiling less than a ton or so.</li>
<li>You will probably have to trim a little more off the base if it is 
  hard. The feel of a cut will inform you if you need to cut more.</li>  
</ol>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Edible yield from 2 shoots weighing 33-1/2 ounces 
was 14-3/4 ounces or 44%. I have had yields as high as 50%  with shoots 
from other purchases. It probably depends on season.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Just do as the recipe says. Further cooking 
is not really necessary once they've been simmered.<p></p>
