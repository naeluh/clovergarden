<h1>Bulgur Wheat</h1>
<br><img src="img/gr_bulgsz01g.jpg" alt="Bulgur Wheat #1, #2, #3, #4" class=mrg>
[Bulgur (Turk); Bollgur (Albania); Pligouri, Pourgouri (Greek); 
Gurgur (Aramaic); Bulgoor (Armenia); Cerealis (Rome); Arisah (Biblical); 
<i>Triticum durum</i> (sometimes other varieties)]
<p>
Bulgur is sometimes called "cracked wheat", but not at all 
interchangeable with regular cracked wheat. For bulgur, whole wheat 
kernels are soaked, then boiled or steamed and dried. When dry, the hulls 
and some of the bran are removed (as little as 5%) after which they are 
crushed and sorted to various mesh sizes. This form cooks much faster 
than cracked wheat and can be used uncooked (just soak well). As with 
parboiled rice, some of the bran nutrients are driven deeper into the 
berry for better nutrition. Bulgur is much used in the cuisines of 
southeastern Europe, Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Central 
Asia, North Africa, ancient Rome and the Levant, The photo shows #1 
and #2 (top row) and #3 and #4 (bottom row).</p>

<p>Originally a specialty of the Armenians and Assyrians, this method of 
treating wheat was also known to the Mongoles. Bulgar was carried far and 
wide, first by the Romans, then by the Ottoman Empire. Because a minimum 
amount of the bran is milled off, the USDA classifies bulgur as a whole 
wheat product.</p>

In Turkey there are two grades: 
<ul>
  <li>K&ouml;ftelik: &nbsp; Fine grind for Kofta</li>
  <li>Pilavlik: &nbsp; Coarse grind for Pilaf</li>
  </ul>
In North America thre are five grades, the first four of which are 
common.
<ul>
  <li>#1: &nbsp; Fine - often mixed with ground lamb to make kibbe.</li>
  <li>#2: &nbsp; Medium - used for tabouli</li>
  <li>#3: &nbsp; Medium Coarse - used for pilafs, casseroles, baked 
    dishes.</li>
  <li>#4: &nbsp; Coarse - used for soups - not as common as #3.</li>
  <li>#5 &nbsp; Very coarsely crushed - almost whole grains. Not common.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Bulgur can be found packaged and sometimes in 
bulk in markets serving communities from Southeast Europe, 
Turkey, Armenia, the Levant, the Middle East and North Africa. Ethnic 
markets will probably have it in grades from #1 to #4. Preferably buy 
from a source with high turnover.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Because bulgur contains some of the oils from 
the raw wheat, it is subject to rancidity. In a tightly sealed container 
in a cool place it will be usable up to 4 months.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Bulgur can be used uncooked (it has already 
been fully cooked), it just needs a bit of soaking. Cooking should be 
until bulgur is tender but not mushy. Timing will depend on coarsness, 
so check for doneness. Like pasta, it should still have just a little 
bite.<p></p>
