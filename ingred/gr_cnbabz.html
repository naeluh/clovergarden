These very immature whole cobs of corn are quite popular in Southeast 
Asia. They are usually grown on a variety of corn that produces a larger 
number of small ears rather than a couple of large ears. They are hand 
harvested within 3 days of the silks appearing on the cob, and hand 
shucked.</p> 
<p>Baby corn is easily available canned in North America, nearly all 
coming from Thailand. Fresh baby corn is often used in Thailand, but 
is not commonly available in North America due to the amount of hand 
labor involved. Baby Corn has a lightly crunchy texture and is only a 
little sweet, but it has a definite corn flavor. Its main contributions 
to a recipe are texture and appearance. The largest of the photo 
specimens was 3-3/4 inches long and 3/4 inch diameter at the base.

<p><b>Buying &amp; Storing:</b> &nbsp; This is now a very popular product 
in North America and can be found even in most supermarkets, at least it 
can here in Southern California. It should definitely be found in any 
market serving a Southeast Asian community.</p>
<p>Though canned, it tends to darken and lose its fresh color and flavor 
fairly rapidly, so it should be used within a year.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This product requires no cooking, so it can be 
added to soups in the last minutes or to salads right from the can. On the 
other hand, it is not harmed by a bit of cooking. Baby corn is often used 
whole or cut into just a few pieces. It is used in soups, stews, 
curries and stir fries.</p>
