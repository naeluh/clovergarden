<p>
This corn is harvested in the "milk stage" when the kernels contain a 
sweet white liquid. Unfortunately most people do not experience it at 
its best, because it should go directly from the corn stalk to boiling 
water. The problem is, as soon as it's picked the sugars start to convert 
into starches. Today's very sweet white and yellow varieties have been 
developed to hold their sweetness as long as possible, but it still fades 
fairly rapidly.</p>

<h3>Types:</h3> &nbsp; There's not much difference between White and Yellow 
Sweet Corn. White predominates here in Southern California. Red Sweet Corn 
can also sometimes be found, and it tastes pretty much the same.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Buy your corn at a local farmer's market of from 
some other source you know has fresh corn and a high turnover. Pull the 
husk back a bit at the tip end so you can see the kernels. The kernels 
should not have too many gaps, and should be pushed up against each other, 
but not too hard, and the color should still be fairly light. Really large, 
square, crowded kernels of darker color indicate an older cob that will be 
tougher and less sweets. There should be no evidence of worm damage (which 
always starts at the tip). 

<p>Do not pull off the husks in the store, that will just accelerate the 
conversion of sugar to starch. Pull them off just before cooking. Some 
people cut a little off the stem end and stand their cobs stem down in a 
bowl of sugar water in an attempt to fool the corn into thinking it's still 
on the plant. I haven't tested this, so I don't know how well it works. I 
refrigerate to slow conversion. Cook it as soon as you can - see our recipe

<h2 id="strip">Stripping Corn Kernels</h2>

<p>There are special tools for stripping corn kernels, but in my experience, and 
according to other writers, they don't work very well. A very sharp thin 
santoko knife works best. The Sweet Corn shown in the photos below is 
White Corn, which is by far the most common in markets here in Los Angeles.
</p>

<h3>Whole Kernels</h3>

<p><img src="img/gr_cornkrn05e.jpg" alt="Corn Cob with Stripped Kernels" class=mrg>
Just hold the cob straight upright by the tip with the stem end against 
you cutting board. Make several cuts down the side, guiding the knife so it 
is tight against cob. 5 or 6 cuts will do it, leaving amazingly little edible 
still on the cob.</p>

<p>Some people use a Bundt Pan, setting the point of the cob in the central 
tube, then cutting as above. This stabilizes the cob, and the pan collects 
all the kernels. I don't bother with this, my cutting board is large, and 
few kernels make it off the edges.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 14 ounce cob (with husks and stem - 9 ounces husked 
and stems cut) will yield about 4-3/4 ounces of kernels. Two cobs will equal 
about the same as one 15 ounce can of whole kernel corn, drained.

<h3>Cream Style Corn</h3>

<p><img src="img/gr_cornkrn08e.jpg" alt="Corn Cob with Cream Style Kernels" class=mrg>
For this, you want just the creamy contents of the kernels, leaving all 
the skins behind. Take your very sharp knife and holding the cob firmly, 
slice deeply down each row, right down the center of the kernels. Now hold 
the cob from the tip, wide end firmly on you cutting board. Use the back 
side, not the sharp side, of you prep knife to scrape down the cob all 
around. You want to leave all the empty skins with the cob, so don't 
scrape so hard they are pulled loose.</p>
<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 14 ounce cob (with husks and stem - 9 ounces husked 
and stems cut) will yield about 3.7 ounces of milk and pulp. This yield 
is increased by the necessity of adding water when cooking.</p>
<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; You'll have to add about 2 Tablespoons of water per 
cob of corn to get about the consistency of canned "cream style" corn, as the 
milk will solidify when heated, so your yeild will be about 4.7 ounces per cob.
