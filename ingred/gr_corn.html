<h1>Corn / Maize</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
[Corn (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand); Maize (everywhere else); 
<i>Zea Mays</i>] 

<p>"Maize" (from the Spanish) is used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, because 
there "corn" is a general name for grains. Our "Corn" is a shortened form 
of "Indian Corn", which now refers only to multicolored field corn.</p>

<p>First developed by Mezoamerican cultures, this grass crop spread into 
North and South America in pre-Columbian times and is now a major crop 
worldwide. There are two general classes: "Sweet Corn" is eaten fresh, frozen 
or canned. "Field Corn" is dried for processing into flour and other products, 
and for animal feed. The two primary colors for both classes are White and 
Yellow.<p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><img src="img/gr_corng01s.jpg" alt="Corn ears on stalks" class=mrg>
Cultivation of the wild grasses that were developed into corn is thought 
to have begin in the Balsas river valley, in or around the south central 
Mexican state of Puebla, about 8700 years ago. There is significant 
controversy over exactly what wild grasses were developed into domesticated 
corn, but there was a great expansion of diversity about 3000 years ago. 
From there modern corn was developed, and continues to be developed to this 
day.

</p>

<p>The kernels of the wild grasses corn was developed from are very small 
and encased in a hard shell. It is thought these kernels were "popped" 
like popcorn to make them edible. As better varieties were developed the 
kernels could be prepared in a wider variety of ways. Spread was rapid, 
and by 1300 CE or so it had become the staple crop throughout North, 
Central and South America, and the Caribbean. European traders spread 
corn worldwide, but the United States still produces almost half the 
world's crop, with China a distant second.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="type" class=lrg>Types <small>of</small> Corn</h2>

<p>Different varieties of corn are used for each of these forms, selected 
for the best characteristics for the specific use.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Silage Corn</h3> is used for animal feed, particularly cattle. 
It is harvested before the fruit has formed, when the sweetness is still 
mainly in the stems. The stems and leaves are chopped up and stored in 
tall "silos", where anaerobic bacteria ferment it, producing first acetic 
acid (vinegar), then lactic acid. This is a tricky process - don't try 
it at home. 
<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Sweet Corn</h3> is corn intended to be eaten fresh, on or off the 
cob, or frozen or canned. Corn is practically the only common food product 
where canned is considered superior to frozen. The best results are had 
when sweet corn goes directly from stalk into boiling water, because the 
moment an ear is picked the sugars start to convert into starches.
<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Field Corn</h3> is intended to be dried on the cob for use in 
making cornstarch, cornmeal, grits, and many other products, and for 
feeding to hogs and cattle. Now, due to the questionable integrity of 
our elected officials, it is also fermented into SUV fuel, a process 
that possibly takes more energy than it produces, and seriously increases 
food prices worldwide. It does, however, keep the powerful farm lobby 
happy.
<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Blue Corn</h3> is a variety grown by the Hopi Indians of Arizona. 
It is particularly adapted to the dry environment they live in, and is 
also grown in Mexico where it is made into blue tortillas. Their bright 
color has been found useful for making the blue corn tortilla chips sold 
by Trader Joe's.
<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Flint Corn / Decorative Corn</h3> is very hard corn with small 
kernels in various colors and multi-color (calico) sold on the cob as 
"Indian Corn" for use as thematic decorations around the Thanksgiving 
(US) holiday in the Autumn. Carefully selected varieties of Flint Corn, 
mostly white or yellow, but in colors for the gourmet market, are use 
for making popcorn.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Waxy Corn / Glutinous Corn / Sticky Corn</h3> is a mutant variety 
developed as a stable crop in East and Southeast Asia. While most varieties 
contain the starches amylose and amylopectin, this corn contains only 
amylopectin.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="prod" class=lrg>Corn Products</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Sweet Corn - on the Cob</h3>
<br><a href="gr_cncobz.html">
<img src="img/gr_cnoncob02h.jpg" alt="Corn on Cob" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Zea mays</i> var. <i>saccharata</i> and var. <i>rugosa</i>]
<p>
This corn is harvested in the "milk stage" when the kernels contain a 
sweet white liquid. Unfortunately most people do not experience it at 
its best, because it should go directly from the corn stalk to boiling 
water. The problem is, as soon as it's picked he sugars start to convert 
into starches. Today's very sweet white and yellow varieties have been 
developed to hold their sweetness as long as possible, but it still 
fades rapidly. 
&nbsp; <a href="gr_cncobz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Canned <small>&amp;</small> Frozen Sweet Corn</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cncan01h.jpg" alt="Canned Corn Kernels" class=mrg>
<p>Corn being highly seasonal, a large amount of sweet corn is harvested 
for canning and freezing. Unlike just about every other vegetable, canned 
corn is widely considered superior to frozen. Canned corn is available 
in whole kernel and "cream style" where the kernels are lightly crushed 
and/or chopped. Both canned and frozen corn are, of course, already 
lightly cooked.	A 15 ounce can holds the equivalent about 2 North American 
size cobs of Sweet Corn. about 9 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Canned "Cream Style" Sweet Corn</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cncrm02h.jpg" alt="Canned 'Cream Style' Corn" class=mrg>
<p>This is not the same product you'll get by stripping "Cream Style" yourself 
from fresh cobs. Our <a href="gr_cncobz.html#strip"><b>Cream Style 
Corn</b></a> method is almost free of skins, while the commercial product is just chopped 
up corn with water and a thickener. Ingred: Corn, Water, Sugar, Modified Corn 
Starch, Salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Waxy Corn</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cnwaxy01h.jpg" alt="Cooked Waxy Corn on the Cob" class=mrg>
[Glutinous Corn, Sticky Corn; <i>Zea mays</i> var. <i>ceratina</i>]
<p>
Corn was brought to China in about 1520 and is first mentioned in Chinese 
local histories in 1550. While Waxy Corn is not common in the Americas, 
it was selected and bred in East and Southeast Asia. Today, the Asian 
markets in Southern California have plenty of it, pre-cooked, and in the 
freezer cases. Presumably it is mostly eaten cold as a snack. Compared 
to our Sweet Corn, it is a bit bland.</p>

<p>This corn contains no gluten, but gets its name from containing only 
amylopectin starch with no amylose at all. It produces smaller cobs than 
our familiar types. the larger of the photo specimens was 1-7/8 inch 
diameter, 7 inches long and weighed 8-1/2 ounces. Many tons are now 
grown in North America, but are grown under contract to food processors 
needing amylopectin starch and for animal feed. As animal feed it has 
proven superior to regular corn.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Baby Corn</h3>
<br><a href="gr_cnbabz.html">
<img src="img/gr_cnbaby04h.jpg" alt="Baby Corn Cobs" class=mrg></a>
[Khao-pote Onn (Thai); Sali Orn (Laos)]
<p>
These very immature whole cobs of corn are quite popular in Southeast 
Asia. They are easily available canned in North America, most of it 
coming from Thailand. It has a lightly crunchy texture and is only a 
little sweet, but it has a definite corn flavor. The largest of the 
photo specimens was 3-3/4 inches long and 3/4 inch diameter at the 
base.
&nbsp; <a href="gr_cnbabz.html"><b>Details &amp; Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Popcorn</h3>
<br><a href="gr_cnpopz.html">
<img src="img/gr_cnpop01h.jpg" alt="Popped and not popped popcorn" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Zea mays</i> var <i>averta</i>]
<p>
Popped corn was known to the native population of the Americas for thousands 
of years, in fact popping may be the way the grass ancestral to corn was 
originally prepared for eating. A hard "flint corn" variety is used, dried 
to the right moisture content. To pop it, it simply needs to be heated by 
some means until the internal steam pressure builds up and explodes the 
hull. The starch within has become gelatinized, but upon expanding it 
solidifies into a foam. The photo specimens were from Turkey, purchased at 
one of the local muti-ethnic markets in Los Angeles. The kernels were about 
0.33 inches long, and popped very well.

<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="cuzco">Cuzco Yellow Corn</h3><br>
<img src="img/gr_cncuzco02e.jpg" alt="Unroasted and Roasted Cuzco Yellow Corn" class=mrg>
[Maiz Cancha Amarillo; <i>Zea mays</i>]
<p>
This corn, from Peru, is completely dried and intended to be roasted for use 
as a snack. The photo shows as packaged on the left and after roasting on 
the right. Only a few pop open and they don't expand like Popcorn, but they 
are soft enough to eat. Kernels are large, typically 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 inches 
(23 x 13 x 5 mm). See recipe <a href="../recipes/aag_cncuz1.html">
<b>Cuzco Toasted Corn</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="toast">Toasted Corn / Corn Nuts&reg;</h3>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/gr_crntst02h.jpg" alt="Bowl of Toasted Corn" class=mrg> 
[<i>Zea mays</i>]
This very popular snacks were invented in California in 1936 and later 
renamed "Corn Nuts". By 1964 they being made from a hybrid of 
<a href="gr_corn.html#cuzco"><b>Cuzco Corn</b></a> that could be grown in California. 
Today the name "Corn Nuts&reg;" is owned by Kraft Foods, and they are no 
longer made from Cuzco type corn. Generic products are named "Tasted Corn". 
These are all made by soaking corn kernels in water for 3 days, roasting 
in Corn Oil and salting. Corn, Corn Oil and Salt are the only ingredients.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Corn Syrup</h3>
<br>This, and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) are industrial sweeteners 
made from corn by an enzyme and fungus process, generally using 
genetically engineered enzymes on genetically engineered corn. While 
I have nothing against enzymes and fungus, the final product may have 
some serious metabolic problems when consumed. It is currently the 
subject of great controversy between food activists and food processors. 
See <a href="gr_corn.html#health"><b>Health &amp; Nutrition</b></a> for details.
<p></p>

<h3>Corn Oil:</h3>
<br>This is one of the most common salad and cooking oils in the 
supermarkets. Tests by Cooks Illustrated showed it to be terrible in 
mayonnaise but good in salad dressing and highly desirable for french 
fries. It cannot, however, be used for commercial fries because it is 
a highly polyunsaturated oil with an oxidation number of 6.2 (vs. olive 
oil at 1.5 and beef tallow at 0.86 - for details see our 
<a href="oilchart.html">Oil Chart</a>). What that means, is that when 
heated, corn oil quickly becomes rancid, so feel free to use it for a 
small batch of fries, but don't try to reuse this oil.
<p></p>  

<h3>Cornstarch</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cnstar02k.jpg" alt="Cornstarch" class=mrg>
[Cornflour (UK)]
<p>
Pure white starch powder extracted from corn has become the most common 
culinary thickener, used especially in Asian recipes. It is not the most 
ideal for all applications, having less thickening power than potato starch 
and a light corn flavor which can interfere in some recipes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cornmeal</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cnmealc01k.jpg" alt="Coarse Yellow Corn Meal" class=mrg>
Available in several grit sizes and in both white and yellow (the photo 
specimen is yellow and coarse) this is simply dried corn ground in 
a mill. It's very popular in the American South, Italy and Ukraine. 
Cornmeal is used to make corn bread, batter for fried foods, and 
porridge, which can be made thin, or so thick it solidifies when 
cooled (cornmeal mush in North America, polenta in Italy, Mamalyga 
in Ukraine).
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Precooked Cornmeal</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_crnpcm02k.jpg" alt="White Precooked Corn Meal" class=mrg>
[Harina de Ma&iacute;z Precocida, Masa de Arepa, Masarepa (Spanish); 
Farine de Ma&iacute;s Pr&eacute;cuite (Portuguese)]
<p>
Available in both white and yellow (the photo specimen is white) this 
product is very popular in northern South America for making Arepas, corn 
cakes very popular among all classes in Colombia and Venezuela. The corn 
is cooked and dried before grinding, which greatly changes its cooking 
properties. It saves tremendous labor by cooks who previously had to 
do a lot of pounding to make Arepas. The photo specimen 
is P.A.N. brand, made in USA under license from Alimentos Polar 
International, of Venezuela.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Hominy / Nixtamal</h3>
<br><a href="gr_hominz.html">
<img src="img/gr_nixtam03h.jpg" alt="White &amp; Yellow Nixtamal" class=mrg></a>
This product is made by soaking dried 
corn in a strong alkali, lye-water (US) or lime-water (Mexico), until the 
outer hulls are removed. This process was first used about 3500 years ago 
in Guatemala, and has several nutritional advantages. It converts niacin 
into a form more readily absorbed by the body, improves digestibility of 
amino acids, and the lime treated version adds calcium to balance corn's 
excess of phosphorus. This can be made from yellow or white corn, but the 
white dominates.
<p>In the photo, white nixtamal, prepared with lime, was canned, thus it 
has been cooked to some extent. The fresh yellow nixtamal on the right has 
not been cooked at all and is intended for inclusion in Menudo and similar 
soups. Both white and yellow are also sold dried and broken (see Grits below). 
For details and more information about the nutritional value of 
nixtamalization, see 
<a href="gr_hominz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Giant White Corn</h3>
<br><a href="gr_crngwz.html">
<img src="img/gr_crngw10h.jpg" alt="Whole Cobs of Giant White Corn" class=mrg></a>
[Choclo (Elote)  Peruano Gigante del Cusco; Cacahuazintle (Mexican 
variety) &nbsp; | &nbsp; Maiz Pelado Blanco, Mote Pelado, Maiz Para 
Pozole; <i>Zea mays</i>]
<p>
This corn has been grown in Peru for 7000 years or so, and is popular 
from southern Mexico to Chile. The photo specimens (Choclo Entero - "on 
the cob") were purchased frozen from a large market in Los Angeles 
(Burbank) that specializes in Mexican, Central American and South 
American foods. The larger was 7 inches long, 2-3/4 inches in diameter 
and weighed 13-1/8 ounces, with kernels about 3/4 inch across. The 
Mexican Cacahuazintle is a little smaller. The names after the "|" are 
"peeled" (Hominy), for use in Tamales, Pozole soup and the like. This 
is traditionally done by boiling the kernels in a solution of water and 
lye, calcium hydroxide or another strong caustic, then rubbing off the 
peels. This also has the effect of greatly increasing availability of 
niacin (vitamin B3) - untreated corn has none in an available form. 
This process is called Nixtamalization.
&nbsp; <a href="gr_crngwz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll>

<h3>Masa</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_masa01k.jpg" alt="White Masa Dough" class=mrg>
[Masa Nixtamalera; Masa de Maiz (Spanish)]
<p>
A dough made from ground Nixtamal (see above), used to make tortillas, 
tamales, pupusas, arepas and many other Latin American dishes. It is best 
ground from fresh Nixtamal and is available in that form in markets 
serving a Latin American community (or at least it is here in Los 
Angeles). If necessary, it can be made from Masa de Harina and water. 
Masa can be made from yellow corn or white, but the white dominates, 
except for making yellow corn tortillas.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Masa de Harina</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_masah01k.jpg" alt="White Masa Harina" class=mrg>
This is Nixtamal dried and ground into flour to be used to make Masa 
whenever fresh Mase Nixtamalera is not available. Naturally it comes in 
both white and yellow (amarillo). The photo specimen is white.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Grits</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cngrit01h.jpg" alt="Coarse Corn Grits" class=mrg>
This is simply coarsely ground corn kernels, which may be yellow corn or 
dried hominy (see above). It is the national dish of the Confederate 
States of America, but is also enjoyed by many Damn Yankees, and there's 
nothing Johnny Reb can do about it. Grits are cooked into a porridge, 
which may be eaten as is or simmered down fairly dry, cooled, molded into 
blocks, sliced and fried, most properly in bacon fat.
<p>Grits should be quite coarse, but most sold in supermarkets are 
nothing more than coarse cornmeal. The photo sample is quite coarse and 
was obtained from an Indian (Asian) market in Los Angeles, but most of 
the ethnic markets here have similar grits for their Latin American 
customers. If you can't find it, grits suppliers in the Deep South are 
perfectly happy to export the stuff, even to destinations north of the 
Mason Dixon line.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Inca Purple Corn</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cornincp02h.jpg" alt="Purple Corn Cobs" class=mrg>
[Maiz Morato]
<p>
This nearly black corn is fully mature and thoroughly dried on the cob, 
so it needs to be knocked off the cob and soaked overnight, or ground to 
flour, for use. The photo specimens were 5 inches long and 1.8 inches 
diameter, purchased from Catalina's Market in Los Angeles, but also 
available from Vallarta.
<br class=cll></p> 

<h3>Tortillas</h3>
<br><img src="img/bk_tortill07h.jpg" alt="White and Yellow Tortillas" class=mrg>
These are basically chapatis made from Nixtamal 
corn, yellow or white (and sometimes blue). It is evidence of a decline in 
traditional expectations among Indian households in Southern California that 
tortilla presses are now commonly sold in Artesia for use in forming chapatis. 
As with chapatis, tortillas are often heated on a hot tava, except it's 
called a comal. In the United States tortillas are now the second highest 
volume packaged bread product after sliced bread. The photo specimens are 
typical at 5-1/2 inches diameter and 0.06 inch thick.
<p>White corn tortillas are generally preferred over yellow except for deep 
fried items where yellow corn is preferred. Tortillas are often cut, deep 
fried and salted to form "corn chips", an extremely popular snack item. 
Note that in the American Southwest and along the northern border of 
Mexico tortillas are also made from wheat flour. These tortillas are 
less crumbly so can be made large enough to use as wrappers to make 
burritos, which are <u>not</u> a traditional Mexican dish, but part 
of the US Southwest border cuisine.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tortilla Chips / Corn Chips</h3>
<br><img src="img/bk_cnchipb01h.jpg" alt="Blue Corn Chips" class=mrg>
Tortilla Chips / Corn Chips are an intensely popular snack, having an 
excellent blend of corn flavor, salt and oil - you just can't stop 
eating them. Most are yellow or white, but the ones in the photo are 
made from blue corn. Tortilla chips are cut from rolled out tortilla 
stock, though if factory made it was a continuous wide band, not round 
pieces. Corn Chips (Frito Lay and the like) are extruded like pasta and 
have a coarser surface and different curl.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Corn Smut</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_cnsmut01k.jpg" alt="Smut infected cob" class=mrg>
[Huitlacoche; Cuitlacoche (Mexico) <i>Ustilago maydis</i>]
<p>
North of the Mexican border corn smut is a crop destroying fungus 
infection to be avoided. In Mexico it is encouraged and harvested as 
<i>huitlacoche</i> (literally "raven's poop") and used in various dishes. 
It is considered a very desirable delicacy with a sweet earthy flavor 
(among other aromatic compounds it contains vanillin).</p>
<p>It is harvested while still immature 
because later it will be dry and completely filled with fungus spores. 
In Mexico it is almost always used fresh, but some is also canned for 
export. Efforts have been made to introduce it into other North American 
cuisines, and the USDA has an ongoing experimental program, but so far 
it has seen little market penetration.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p><h3>Protein Deficiency:</h3> &nbsp; The most immediate problem for 
populations dependent on corn for nutrition is that you can't live on 
corn alone - its protein profile is deficient. For this reason beans must 
be co-cropped with the corn, as they are protein deficient in a 
complimentary configuration. The beans also fix nitrogen in the soil to 
provide a more fertile soil for the corn.
<p>Some time back the Mexican government decided to "help" the Huichol 
people, who had to work exceedingly hard to keep weeds from overrunning 
their corn crop. The government provide herbicides, which killed the 
weeds - and the beans. This resulted in impending starvation for the 
Huichol people. To overcome this, they sent expeditions to the United 
States to trade their brightly colored crafts for beans. This introduced 
not only the crafts, but brought the likes of Don Jos&eacute; Matsuwa 
north and introduced Huichol shamanism into this country 
(<a href="gr_corn.html#c01"><b>C1</b></a>).</p>

<h3>Naicin Deficiency:</h3> &nbsp; When corn was taken from the Americas 
to the rest of the world, many peoples found it could be grown efficiently 
with high yield, and their food supply, particularly for the poor, became 
dependent on corn. This caused a very serious disabling disease called 
"pellagra" to become widespread due to the lack of usable niacin 
(vitamin B3) in corn. In contrast, cultures in Central and South America 
which were similarly dependent on corn did not suffer this disease, due 
to the way they processed corn. This is discussed in our 
<a href="gr_hominz.html">Nixtamal - Hominy</a> page.<p></p>

<p><h3>Corn Syrup <small>&amp;</small> High Fructose Corn Syrup:</h3> 
&nbsp; These products, in particular High Fructose Corn Syrup, have 
displaced sugar as the sweetener used in the industrial production of 
food in the United States, particularly the production of "junk food" 
and sodas. The reason is, they are cheaper. The reason they are cheaper 
is, just as with ethanol, massive subsidies provided by our Congress 
Critters to keep the farm lobby donating funds to their reelection 
campaigns.
<p>Health advocates claim that HFCS is worse for you than other sugars 
and a major cause of obesity in America. The corn products manufacturers 
claim it is no worse for you than any other form of sugar. A recent study 
by the University of California concluded it is worse for you. 
Predictably the corn product manufacturers denounced the study as bunk - 
without providing any counter study or additional data. See link 
(<a href="gr_corn.html#c02">C2</a>) and our <a href="sweet.html">Sweeteners</a>
