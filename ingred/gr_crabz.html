These grasses have been grown for thousands of years, both for the 
tiny grains for human consumption, and the grass itself for animal fodder.
These grasses are highly nutritious with a high protein content.

     [<i>Digitaria exilis</i> (White fonio) &nbsp; | &nbsp;

   These grains are cultivated as minor crops. <i>D. exilis</i> is 
   cultivated in Guinea, Togo, Nigeria and Senegal. The very similar 
   <i>D. iburua</i> is cultivated in Nigeria, Niger, Togo and Benin. 
   </p>
   <p>This grass barely has seed heads. The seeds are aranged single 
   file up a thin stem. and are very tiny. They are also difficult to 
   hull. Traditional methods include pounding with sand, then separating 
   out the sand and husks with water, but a simple husking machine was 
   invented in 1996.</p>
   <p>This grain is now being promoted by the Health Food industry as 
   more nutritious than Quinoa, and also by chefs of fancy restaurants. 
   In both cases the enthusiasm is primarily because Fonio is exotic, 
   expensive, difficult to get and fits into the current gluten free 
   fad. This threatens to make a food poor region even more food poor. 
   </p>
   <p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; As it is being heavily promoted as a 
   "gluten free" "ancient "superfood" Fonio seeds and flour can be 
   purchased on-line from many sources. The photo specimens, from 
   Nigeria,were purchased for 2018 US $1.10 per ounce.</p>
   <p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; In Africa, Fonio is most often placed in 
   a basket and steamed. It can also be steamed like rice in a tightly 
   closed saucepan, keeping a 1 to 1 Fonio to Water ratio. A little 
   oil can be included to keep the grains more separated.</p>
   <p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; Quinoa.

   </p><p>
   This annual crabgrass, found in temperate and tropical regions of both 
   hemispheres, is used mainly as a nutritious animal fodder with an 
   unusually high protein content. To a lesser extent, the seeds are 
   used for human consumption, particularly in Germany and Poland. This 
   grass is also well known for invading lawns that aren't carefully 
   maintained.

   state in far northeast corner of India.
