<h1>Giant White Corn</h1>
<br><img src="img/gr_crngw10g.jpg" alt="Giant White Corn on the Cob" class=mrg>
[Choclo (Elote) Peruano Gigante del Cusco; Cacahuazintle (Mexican 
variety) &nbsp; | &nbsp; Maiz Pelado Blanco, Mote Pelado, Maiz Para 
Pozole; <i>Zea mays</i>]
<p>
This corn has been grown in Peru for 7000 years or so, and is popular 
from southern Mexico to Chile. The photo specimens (Choclo Entero - "on 
the cob") were purchased frozen from a large market in Los Angeles 
(Burbank) that specializes in Mexican, Central American and South 
American foods. The larger was 7 inches long, 2-3/4 inches in diameter 
and weighed 13-1/8 ounces, with kernels about 3/4 inch across. The 
Mexican Cacahuazintle is a little smaller. The names after the "|" are 
"peeled" (Hominy), for use in Tamales, Pozole soup and the like. This 
is traditionally done by boiling the kernels in a solution of water and 
lye, calcium hydroxide or another strong caustic, then rubbing off the 
peels. This also has the effect of greatly increasing availability of 
niacin (vitamin B3) - untreated corn has none in an available form. 
This process is called Nixtamalization.</p>

<p>Be Aware: modern industrial processes can peel corn without use of 
caustics, but this does not convert the niacin. If it matters to you, 
look for indications on packages that mention lye, lime, sodium 
hydroxide, calcium hydroxide or "traditional processing".</p>

<b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Giant White Corn can be found in markets 
serving a Latin American community, though it sometimes takes some 
looking. The photo specimens, on the cob and peeled, came from a large 
Los Angeles (Burbank) market specializing in Mexican, Central American 
and South American foods. The kernel to the left under the kidney bean 
is a large unpeeled regular dry white corn kernel, this is <u>not</u> 
what you want. The peeled kernels were imported from Peru in a plastic 
bag, Goya and a couple other companies also sell the peeled product in 
14 ounce plastic bags. It is the preferred corn for the important 
Mexican soup/stew Pozole.</p>

<p><b>Storing:</b> &nbsp; Sealed in a 2-mil thick plastic bag or other 
insect-proof container, and stored in a cool place, the dried corn will 
last a year or more.

<p><img src="img/gr_crngw07e.jpg" alt="Cooked Corn Kernels" class=mrg>
<b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; For the peeled kernels - Soak overnight. 
Pinch off the dark "eye" of each kernel (the point where it attached to 
the cob). This is tedious, but it will allow the kernels to "open like 
a flower" during cooking.</p>
<p>Cooking time suggested by Diana Kennedy is 3 hours, but I find 2-1/2 
hours to be reasonably acceptable for most recipes, but for salads or 
other recipes that will have no additional cooking, go for 3 hours. 
There will always be some fiber, no matter how long you cook it.
The photo to the left shows corn after cooking 3 hours. Some kernels 
did not "open like a flower", but they are tender enough to be eaten.
<br class=cll></p> 

<p><b>IF</b> you need to peel your own corn kernels, here is my adaption 
of Diana Kennedy's method.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place 1 pound of dried kernels in a pot and soak at least overnight. 
<li>Change the water and bring the corn to a boil.</li>
<li>Dilute about one large teaspoon of Unslaked Lime (pickling lime) in 
  a little cold water. Pour into the pot through a strainer (lye may 
  also be used).</li>
<li>Boil the corn for about 10 minutes. Cover and let it soak for 30 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Wash the corn well in several changes of water, rubbing it between 
  your hands to remove the skins.</li>
<li>Pinch off the dark "eye" from each kernel so the corn will "open 
  like a flower".</li>
<li>Cook the corn until the kernels "open like a flower". This will 
  take simmering for 1 to 3 hours depending on the corn, its age and 
  previous processing.</li>
<li>The corn is now "recipe ready".</li>
</ol>
