[Farik; Firik (Turk); <i>Triticum turgidum</i> var. <i>durum</i>]
<p>
Green (unripe) wheat is roasted to give it an attractive smoky flavor. 
It's quite a bit more expensive than Bulgur. This form is used mainly 
in the Levant, Egypt, and across North Africa, but now (2019) it is 
widely available in Turkey due to the influx of Sirian refugees, It has 
recently been discovered by North American health food enthusiasts. 
The samples we have used were imported from Syria and Jordan.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, this was made by burning the wheat in its husks, 
controlled so the damp kernel is not burned. It is then rubbed to rid 
it of the char, dried, and usually cracked. All the samples I have 
seen are very coarsely crushed as in the photo, or just a little 
finer. This grain is relatively perishable and should be used soon 
after purchase. </p>
