<span class=bg>
<b>Grasses</b>, family <i>Poaceae</i>, are among the most 
recently evolved plant categories. They are generally inedible to 
humans,</span> but the seeds of some are the staples of life for us - 
rice, wheat, barley, corn and other grains. Grasses are also indigestible 
to cows, sheep, goats and horses, but they chew them up so bacteria can 
digest them easily, then absorb nutrients produced by the bacteria. 
Pandas and some lemurs can eat grass directly, bamboo anyway, but they 
had to develop an inexplicably high tolerance for toxic cyanide to do 
so.

<p>Grasses are descended from that same primitive magnolia all flowering 
plants are descended from, but are on the Monocot side of the great 
Monocot / Dicot divergence within the flowering plants. Monocot seeds 
sprout just one first leaf, not two, and their leaves are generally long 
and narrow with parallel veins. From some oddments of their structure, 
some researchers think monocots evolved from an aquatic plant.</p>

<h2 id="hist">General &amp; History</h2>

<p>Grasses are one of the more recently evolved families of flowering 
plants. Hard  evidence shows that they existed 66 million years ago, 
near the end of the dinosaur era (Cretaceous), but there is speculation 
the rice tribe may have been around for more than 107 million years.</p>

<p>Grasses now cover vast areas of the world. In some areas not because 
they drive out other plants but because they are beneficial to man. The 
Great Plains of North America were artificially created by the Native 
Americans by burning forests so the buffalo would have plenty grass for 
forage. The burning is no longer done except in parts of Canada, so 
where the plains are not farmed they are slowly reverting to forest.</p>

<p>Grasses range in size from far smaller than lawn grass to giant timber 
bamboo which can grow to around 100 feet tall. A few grasses developed 
concentrated seed heads with a heavy yield of medium to large seeds. This 
made them efficiently harvestable for human and animal food. Humans 
further developed these by selective breeding to create modern grains. 
The most important characteristic developed is that the seed heads do not 
"shatter", but stay together until all seeds are fully mature so they 
can be efficiently harvested. The largest seed heads belong to a grass 
called "corn" in the U.S. and Australia, and "maize" most other places.
</p>

<p>All grasses are built much the same, They are of order <i>Poales</i> 
belonging to clade <i>Commelinids</i> within the Monocots clade. Their 
seeds sprout only one first leaf and their adult leaves are generally 
long and slender with parallel veins. Specific to grasses are hollow 
stems plugged at intervals called "nodes" (think "bamboo") and dense 
clusters of flowers that form seed heads. Grasses propagate not only 
from seed but from runners, sometimes very aggressive runners, that 
sprout new plants around the parent.</p>

<p>Other than their seeds, few grasses are used for human consumption 
because the foliage is generally tough, fibrous, not particularly 
flavorful and often highly toxic. Cows, sheep and goats live happily on 
grasses by chewing them up and running them through multiple stomachs 
where bacteria digest the grasses and the animal absorbs nutrients 
manufactured by the bacteria. Horses, having a more omnivorous digestive 
system, are not so good at surviving on just grasses. In the wild they 
will happily kill and eat any animal they can catch (and have killed 
and eaten people).</p>

<p>Certain grains can be sprouted from seed, then eaten or squeezed into 
juice before they become too tough and toxic. Some health enthusiasts 
ascribe miraculous properties to these sprouts. Of course sprouts do have 
miraculous properties - sprouts of wheat and barley are critical to the 
making of beer, one of the earliest of man's community endeavors and 
possibly the original purpose for farming.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer:</h3> &nbsp; The information here is from publicly 
available material and is not to be considered medical advice. For 
medical advice consult degreed physicians and other duly authorized 
authorities. Unfortunately they often don't seem to know much more 
than the rest of us, but at least it's "official".<p></p>

<h3>General Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Grains are high in proteins, but 
these proteins are never a complete set, though rice comes fairly 
close.  Corn is particularly deficient in both proteins and the 
vitamin niacin. This has caused severe health problems in many parts 
of the world. This is explained in detail in our corn pages.
<p>In any case, a diet heavy in grains must be supplemented with 
either beans or meat. The cost of sufficient meat is too high for 
most of the world's population, but beans are cheap and come in many 
varieties.</p>

<h3>Celiac Disease:</h3> &nbsp; Grains of the wheat family contain a 
protein called "gluten". Something like 1% of the population of North 
America has a genetically caused problem with this. The protein causes 
an auto-immune reaction that is very painful and will eventually destroy 
the intestinal lining. There is no cure, so persons with this problem 
must avoid foods with even a tiny bit of gluten.
<p>Not all grains contain gluten, only wheat and grains closely related 
to wheat. Unfortunately, wheat and its relatives are used in a tremendous 
number of food products which must be avoided. This known problem with 
gluten has spawned an avoidance of gluten even by many health conscious 
people who do not have the celiac problem and this has spawned a growing 
"gluten free" segment of the food processing industry.</p>

<h3>Allergies</h3> &nbsp; Wheat in particular is implicated in quite 
a lot of allergies that are not associated with celiac disease. Other 
grains may cause allergic reactions in some people.<p></p>

<h3>Toxins in Whole Grains:</h3> &nbsp; Like other plants, grains 
have strategies to discourage predation. In whole grains you will 
find phytic acid (inhibits mineral absorbtion),  lectins (mimic 
insulin, hormones, cause allergy problems and excess fat storage), 
protease inhibitors (liver and lung problems) and goitrogens 
(interfere with thyroid function).
<p>These toxins and other grain problems have caused a number of health 
advocates to be very anti-grain. They point out that people have only 
been eating grains for 10,000 years and have not evolved the ability 
to handle them safely. Of course, these same toxins are also found 
in beans and many other plant foods, and people have been eating 
grains far longer than 10,000 years, that's just when they started 
farming them.<p>
<p>Toxins can be reduced by milling, soaking, sprouting and cooking. 
One very prominent anti-grain advocate found he needed some carbs to be 
healthy, but the only grain he'll eat is cooked milled white rice - in 
which these toxins are minimized.</p>

<h3>Fiber in Whole Grains:</h3> &nbsp; You've been thoroughly 
propagandized that "fiber is good", right? Well, unfortunately, that 
is not entirely so when it comes to grains. The fiber in whole grains 
is tough and abrasive, made mostly of cellulose (wood).
<p>Unlike the "fiber" in many other vegetable foods it is not softened 
easily and ends up abrading the lining of the digestive tract. This is 
particularly a problem in "high bran" bread and cereal products. The 
bran in these products is usually not from grinding whole wheat to 
fine flour, but is added from stocks produced by the milling industry.
