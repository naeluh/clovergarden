<h1>Nixtamal - Hominy</h1>
<br><img src="img/gr_nixtam03f.jpg" alt="White and Yellow Hominy" class=mrg>
[Nixtamalized Corn (maize); Nixtamal (Spanish); Nixtamalli (Nahuatl); Hominy 
 (North America, from Powhatan tribe)]
<p>
Corn for tortillas, tamales, soups and similar uses is nixtamalized to 
remove the hard outer skin from the kernels. This product is made by soaking 
dried corn in a strong alkali, lye-water (US) or lime-water (Mexico), until 
the outer hulls can be rubbed off. This process was first used about 3500 
years ago in Guatemala, and has several nutritional advantages. It converts 
niacin into a form more readily absorbed by the body, improves digestibility 
of amino acids, and the lime treated version adds calcium to balance corn's 
excess of phosphorus. This can be made from yellow or white corn.</p>
<p>In the photo, white corn nixtamal, prepared with lime, was canned, thus it 
has been cooked to some extent. The fresh yellow nixtamal on the right has 
not been cooked at all and is intended for inclusion in Menudo and similar 
soups. Both white and yellow are also sold dried and broken (see "Buying" 
below).</p>

Products subjected to nixtamalization are whole kernel corn, both 
fresh and dried, grits (cracked corn), corn meal (masa harina) and 
corn meal dough (masa). The photo to the left shows giant white 
cacahuazintle corn that has been nixtalized before drying. In the photo 
the kernels are dried and about 0.67 inches across. They will expand to 
a larger size when cooked.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Unfortunately, many "grits" and cornmeal products 
are not properly labeled as to whether they're just cracked or ground, or 
whether they have been nixtamalized first. There are other industrial 
methods for removing the outer skin, so its having been removed is not 
a good guide.

<p>Some packages, particularly those in markets serving a Mexican 
community, will indicate they have been treated with lime or lye. 
These products are preferred for good nutrition.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Canned and dried products can, with proper 
storage conditions, be held for at least a year, though vitamin content 
will slowly decline. Fresh products such as fresh nixtamalized 
corn kernels and masa (corn flour dough) should be kept refrigerated 
and used within just a few days.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Preparing from Dried:</h3> &nbsp; Here we presume the kernels have 
already been nixtamalized before drying. This how dried giant white 
cacahuazintle corn is generally sold.
<ol>
<li>Soak kernels overnight in water to cover well (it will expand).</li>
<li>For soup, pinch off the brown tip to help it burst open while 
  cooking. Yes this is tedious but mindless, so you can do it while 
  watching your soaps (they haven't canceled all of them yet, have 
  they?).</li>
<li>Cooking time should be about 3 hours, but it can stand a fair 
  amount longer.</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Preparing from whole (skin on) kernels:</h3> &nbsp; Here are the 
instructions adapted from Diana Kenedy's "The Cuisines of Mexico" for 
preparing from whole corn kernels. She presumes dried giant white 
cacahuazintle corn, but it should work with other sizes as well. Start 
two days ahead.
<ol>
<li>Put 1 pound of whole corn kernels in a non-reactive pot.with water to 
  cover. Let it soak overnight.</li>
<li>Change the water and bring it to a boil.</li>
<li>Dilute about 1/2 Tablespoon of unslaked lime with a little cold water 
  and add it, through a strainer, to the pot.</li>
<li>Bring back to a boil for about 10 minutes, then cover and let it soak 
  for another 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Wash well in several changes of water,rubbing it between your hands 
  to remove the thin outer sheath.</li>
<li>For soup, pinch off the brown tip to help it burst open while 
  cooking. Yes this is tedious but midless, so you can do it while 
  watching your soaps (they haven't canceled all of them yet, have 
  they?).</li>
<li>Cooking time should be about 3 hours, but it can stand a fair 
  amount longer.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id=health>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2> 
 
<p>When corn (maize) became a common crop worldwide, particularly for the 
poor, it brought with it a deadly disabling disease called Pellagra. 
This niacin deficiency disease was particularly severe in Spain, northern 
Italy and the US Southeast, and is still a problem in Africa, Indonesia 
and China. It is characterized by terrible skin lesions, sensitivity to 
sunlight, and a whole host of other symptoms, culminating in dementia 
and death.</p>
<p>This disease had not affected the native populations of the 
Americas because their corn was almost always nixtamalized before cooking. 
This process converts the niacin in corn to a form the human body can 
utilize.
