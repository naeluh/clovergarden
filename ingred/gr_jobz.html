Two varieties of the is tropical grass are grown, one as a grain and 
the other for hard shelled beads. While native to Southeast Asia and grown 
there in mountainous regions, this plant is now also grown in the southern 
United States and in the tropical Americas. It is usually pearled except 
in Japan where it is used "brown". This grain is used in soups and to make 
teas and beverages, including distilled alcoholic beverages. In the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, and I presume elsewhere in North America, it 
is always packaged as "Pearl Barley", though it is easily recognized from 
its large size and deep groove on one side.

<p>This grain has a light pleasant flavor somewhere between barley and 
wheat and with a unique aromatic twist. It's resistance to overcooking 
makes it an excellent ingredient in soups.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Job's Tears can be found in most markets serving 
Southeast Asian and Korean communities. They're usually packed in small 
plastic bags of  about 12 ounces, always titled "Pearl Barley". These will 
be found with the other grains and beans.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This pearled grain is subject to rancidity and 
should not be stored long at room temperature, perhaps 4 months in a 
sealed container away from heat and light.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Simmered, this grain is done at about 45 
minutes, but will still have a slightly chewy center. With another hour 
of simmering the grains remain pretty much unchanged, still a bit chewy 
in the center and holding their shape well. One cup of dried grains will 
yield 3 cups cooked, so you'll need to start with about 4 cups of 
water.<p></p>
