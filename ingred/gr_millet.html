<h1>Millets</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
[family <i>Poaceae</i> subfamily <i>Panicoideae</i> except finger 
millet subfamily <i>Chloridoideae</i>]</p>

<p>Millets were the original grains of China, cultivated since at least 
5000 BCE and long predating rice cultivation. I use the plural because 
millet is not a single taxonomic group, but an agricultural grouping of 
similar small seeded grasses, some related only at the family level.  
examples of noodles (2000 BCE) were made from two kinds of millet.  
All of them are high in protein, but even the ones called "glutenous" 
contain no gluten.</p>
 
<p>The earliest noodles preserved for examination (2000 BCE) were made 
in northern China from two varieties of millet, Foxtail 
(<i>Setaria italica</i>), and a "glutenous" variety of Proso
(<i>Panicum miliaceum</i>). The glutenous millet was needed to provide 
adhesion to hold the noodles together. Similar noodles are still made 
in northern China where wheat does not grow well, and are called 
"iron wire" noodles because they are much stiffer than wheat noodles.
</p>

<p>Most millets can be stored for (years in the husks) for use in times 
of food shortage, but vitamin content probably suffers.</p>

<h2 id=var class=lrg>Varieties <small>of</small> Millet</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Foxtail Millet:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_milletft02h.jpg" alt="Foxtail Millet Seed Head" class=mrg>
[Xiao Mi (China); Tinal (India); <i>Setaria italica</i>]
<p>
This millet is a major food crop in dry regions of northern China. 
In North America it is grown on a moderate scale for animal silage and 
bird seed. In China this millet was in cultivation by 5000 BCE, is known 
in Europe from around 2000 BCE and was cultivated in Turkey by at least 
600 BCE.</p>
<p>Foxtail millet is the most common millet in China today and is a 
component of the 4000 year old noodles recently found in China but 
cannot be made into noodles alone - other, stickier millets are needed 
for adhesion, in this case Proso millet.

<h2>Pearl Millet:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_milletpl01h.jpg" alt="Pearl Millet Seed Heads" class=mrg>
[Dugub (Senegal); Bajri (India); <i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>]
<p>
Originating in tropical Africa, this millet was in cultivation in 
India by 2000 BCE. This millet grows under conditions other grains can 
not, and is an important crop in areas where the soil is poor and salty 
and the climate dry and hot. It now account for about 50% of the millet 
grown worldwide.

<p>This millet is very good as poultry food and is fed to chickens so 
they'll lay the high Omega-3 eggs sold to the health conscious, and is 
sold as a substitute for wheat for persons with wheat intolerance. It 
can be most commonly found in markets serving communities from the 
Indian subcontinent and Africa.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Proso Millet</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_milletp01h.jpg" alt="Common Millet Seed Head" class=mrg>
[Common millet, Broom corn millet, White millet, Hog millet; Siao mi 
(China); <i>Panicum miliaceum</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Little Millet 
<i>Panicum sumatrense</i>]
<p>
Cultivation appears in both the Caucasus and eastern China about 
5000 BCE. It is the second most common millet in China today. The seeds 
are small, about 0.1 inch (2 to 3 mm) and vary in color from cream to 
yellow to orange-red and brown.</p>
<p>Proso millet is grown mainly as animal fodder and bird seed in 
North America, the former Soviet Empire and South America. In India it 
is an important food crop, but it is not grown in Africa. Like Pearl 
Millet it is sold in North America for use by persons with wheat 
intolerance.

<p><b>Little Millet</b> is very similar but smaller with seeds 1.8 to 1.9 mm 
long. It is very tolerant of growing conditions and most grown in 
central India.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Glutinous Millet</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_milletg02h.jpg" alt="Glutinous Millet Seeds" class=mrg>
[Foxtail Millet; <i>Setaria italica</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Proso Millet; 
<i>Panicum miliaceum</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Barnyard Grass; 
<i>Echinochloa villosa</i>]
<p>
There are a number of "glutinous millets", none of which contain 
any gluten. They are simply cultivars of regular millets that have 
close to 100% amylopectin starch, while the regular ones are about 80%, 
amilopectin with the rest amylose. The high amylopectin content causes 
them to cook very sticky. The the 4000 year old noodles found in China 
were made from Foxtail Millet with enough glutinous Proso Millet to 
hold them together.</p>    
<p>The grains shown in the photo are common in Korean markets here 
in Los Angeles and are probably a variety of Foxtail Millet. The 
seeds are tiny about 0.05 inch (1.3 mm) and are dark and greenish in 
color. A Chinese glutinous millet, <i>Echinochloa villosa</i>, has 
quite large 0.16 inch (4 mm) reddish seeds and has been cultivated in 
northern China since the Neolithic. In Europe and North America it is 
considered a serious invasive.

<h2>Finger Millet</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_mtfinger01h.jpg" alt="Finger Millet Seed head" class=mrg>
[Ragi (S. India); Juar, Jowar, Bajra (Hindi); Dagusa (Ethiopia); 
Hong mi, Chi ke (Viet); African millet; <i>Eleusine coracana</i>]
<p>
Native to the Ethiopian and Ugandan highlands, this millet was introduced 
into India by 2000 BCE and is now grown in the Himalayas up to an 
elevation of 7500 feet (2,300 meters). It is often intercroped with 
legumes for better yield. This millet has very good storage properties 
so it can be held (in the husks) for times of shortage.</p>
<p>This millet is used in hundreds of ways throughout the Indian 
subcontinent, including in the making of beer. It is also much eaten 
and made into beverages by the Humong people of Vietnam.

<h2>Sorghum</h2> 
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/gr_sorghum02c.jpg" alt="Seeds" class=mrg>
[Milo, Broom Straw, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]
<p>
Some people classify Sorghum as a "millet", but most do not, and we 
do not classify it as "millet" here. For details, see our 
<a href="gr_ograin.html#sorg"><b>Other Grains</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Celiac Disorder:</h3> &nbsp; Millet contains no gluten, so is safe 
for both Celiacs and persons with gluten allergy. Celiac Disorder is a 
serious degenerative autoimmune condition requiring total elimination 
of gluten proteins from the diet. Gluten is contained only in certain 
grains, and Millet is not one of them, not even the ones called 
"glutenous millet".<p></p>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Millet is highly nutritious. While it is 
moderate in protein and dietary fiber, it is a good source of Copper, 
Phosphorus, Manganese, Magnesium, Vitamin B1,  and is a significant 
source of many other nutrients <p></p>

<h3>Goitrogen:</h3> &nbsp; Many sources extol the significant health 
benefits of millet - but there is also a lot of shrieking on the Internet 
about millet being deadly because it contains goitrogen. Goitrogen can 
negatively affect thyroid function, and induce swelling (goiter). Millet 
does contain goitrogen, and so does Kale. It is true that in the Sudan 
region of Africa, there is a fairly high instance of goiter - but in that 
region, millet is the <u>primary source of calories</u>. Note that Sudan 
is also a deep inland region with severe iodine deficiency. Much millet 
is consumed in India and northern China without such problems. Clearly 
moderate consumption of millet is safe, even beneficial - and if you're 
worried about your thyroid, use iodized salt (that's what it's iodized 
for), and eat a reasonable amount of seafood and seaweed.<p></p>
