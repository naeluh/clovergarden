<h1>Other Grains</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Wheat, Rice, Corn and Barley are not the only grains (or seeds treated 
like grains) that have been important to human nutrition and survival, 
particularly in regions where none of those grains grow well or at all. 
In North America today, some hold a place for taste and cooking 
characteristics, while others are of growing importance for reasons of 
health. The photo is of a field of sorghum. nearly ready for harvest.

<h2>Barley</h2>
<br><a href="gr_barlz.html">
<img src="img/gr_barley05e.jpg" alt="Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Damai (China); <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]<p>
Barley was first domesticated in the Near East with the earliest find 
being in Syria dated to around 7000 BCE. Beer has been made from it since 
about then. It has been grown in Korea from around 1400 BCE. Tibet 
started growing barley around 450 CE. Made into a flour product called 
<i>tsampa</i> it is still an important staple in that region.</p>

<p>Barley comes in two varieties, two row and six row. The six row is 
higher in protein and used primarily as animal feed. The two row is 
higher in sugar and is used more for human consumption. Note that barley 
does contain the protein gluten, not enough to make leavened bread, but 
enough to harm a person with Celiac Disorder.

<h2 id="crab">Crabgrass</h2>
<br><a href="gr_crabz.html">
<img src="img/gr_crabp02h.jpg" alt="Large Crabgrass Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Genus <i>Digitaria</i> of subfamily <i>Panicoideae</i>]
<p>
These annual grasses have been grown for thousands of years, both 
for the tiny grains for human consumption, and the grass itself for 
animal fodder.These grasses are highly nutritious with a high protein 
content, but contain no gluten. They are also considered a very good 
grazing crop. Today, they are most important in Africa. Examples are 
<b>Fonio</b>, <b>Large Crabgrass</b>, and <b>Raishan</b>. For details 
see our <a href="gr_crabz.html"><b>Crabgrass</b></a> page.

<h2 id="job">Job's Tears</h2>
<br><a href="gr_jobz.html">
<img src="img/gr_jobtear01h.jpg" alt="Job's Tears Grains" class=mrg></a>
[Coix, Coixseed, Adlay, Adlal; Hot bo bo (Viet); Yuuki hatomugi (Japan); 
<i>Coix lacryma-jobi</i> var. <i>ma-yuen</i>  | Rosary beads: 
<i>Coix lacryma-jobi</i> var. <i>lacryma-jobi </i>]
<p>
Two varieties of the is tropical grass are grown, one as a grain and 
the other for hard shelled beads. While native to Southeast Asia and grown 
there in mountainous regions, this plant is now also grown in the southern 
United States and in the tropical Americas. It is usually pearled except 
in Japan where it is used "brown". This grain is used in soups and to make 
teas and beverages, including distilled alcoholic beverages. In the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, and I presume elsewhere in North America, it 
is always packaged as "Pearl Barley", though it is easily recognized from 
its large size and deep groove on one side. 	Job's Tears are gluten free.

<h2 id="millet">Millets</h2>
<br><a href="gr_millet.html">
<img src="img/gr_millet05h.jpg" alt="Millet Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[family <i>Poaceae</i> subfamily <i>Panicoideae</i> except finger 
millet subfamily <i>Chloridoideae</i>]
<p>
Millets were the original grains of China, cultivated since at least 
5000 BCE and long predating rice cultivation. I use the plural because 
millet is not a single taxonomic group, but an agricultural grouping of 
similar small seeded grasses, some related only at the family level. The 
earliest preserved examples of noodles (2000 BCE) were made from two 
kinds of millet.  All millets are high in protein, but contain no 
gluten. This important and diverse family now has its own 
<a href="gr_millet.html"><b>Millets</b></a> page.</p>

<h2 id="oat">Oats</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_oat01h.jpg" alt="Oats in their Husks" class=mrg>
[<i>Avena sativa</i>]
<p>
This grain originated in northern Mesopotamia, but the first evidence 
of domestication is from Europe from around 2000 BCE. It is grown in 
temperate zones in both the Old and New Worlds in regions where the 
summers are too wet and cool for other grains, but it is almost 
unknown in Asia.</p>

<p>Oats have not been held in high esteem by some populations but are 
considered very important in Scotland. Samusl Johnson wrote in his 
dictionary, "Oats: a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, 
but in Scotland supports the people". The Scots replied that "Consequently 
England has the finest horses, and Scotland has the finest men". Actually 
many of the less fortunate in England also survived on oats.</p>

<p>In North America oats are known almost entirely for Rolled Oats as a 
hot breakfast cereal, and for oatmeal cookies made from the same product. 
A less known but very fine use of oats is in the brewing of beer, 
particularly oatmeal stout.</p>

<p>Oats are controversial for use in a gluten free diet, though they 
may (or may not) be safe, in North America they are almost always 
contaminated with wheat so are not safe. Oats and particularly oat bran 
are currently being promoted as capable of lowering blood cholesterol. 
The photo shows oat grains still in the husks, the way they would be 
served to horses. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Rasbak distributed under license

<h2 id="rye">Rye</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_rye03h.jpg" alt="Rye Seedheads" class=mrg>
[<i>Secale cereale</i>]
<p>
This grain was first domesticated in eastern Turkey and is still grown there 
as a relatively minor crop. Rye is able to grow in climates so cold other 
grain crops fail, so has been most heavily grown in the northern reaches 
of Europe, including Scandinavia and Russia.</p>
<p>Rye is well known in North America for the flour used to make Rye Bread, 
though that bread is commonly as much wheat as rye because rye has less 
gluten and does not rise as well. This can be somewhat corrected by an 
acidic dough, for which reason sourdough rye is so much made. By this means 
quite edible bread of only rye flour can be made. Rye crisp crackers are also 
very well known and popular. Another popular use for rye is in the making of 
rye whisky.</p>
<p>Rye is still grown widely in Central and Eastern Europe where it has long 
been the main bread grain, particularly in Finland, Latvia and Lithuania. 
Its production is, however, in decline as imported wheat has become 
increasingly available. Russia, Poland and Germany are the major producers.
</p>
<p>Rye is, of course, not safe for celiacs, having a fairly substantial 
gluten content. It's other health problem, affecting both horses and humans, 
is vulnerability to ergot fungus which is seriously toxic. Ergot poisoning 
affects not only the body but the mind, causing convulsions and hallucinations. 
In the past ergot infections have coincided with a rise in witchcraft trials, 
in both Europe and North America.

<h2 id="sorg">Sorghum</h2>
<br><a href="gr_sorgz.html">
<img src="img/gr_sorghum02e.jpg" alt="Sorghum Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Milo, Broom Straw, Egyptian Millet, Sudan Grass, Feterita, Shallu, 
Kaffir Corn, Guinea Corn; Durra (Arabic); Jola, Jowari, Jawari, Juwar 
(India); Gao-liang, Shushu (China); <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]
<p>
The first evidence of cultivated sorghum comes from India and Pakistan 
from earlier than 1000 BCE - but it is not native there. It must have 
been cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa some time before that. Modern 
cultivars appear to have been developed in East Africa about 2000 years 
ago, but exactly where has not been determined. It is not as nutritious as 
wheat or millet, but contains no gluten and tolerates dry regions. It is 
still grown as a food crop over much of the world.

<h2>Teff</h2>
<br><a href="gr_teffz.html">
<img src="img/gr_teff07h.jpg" alt="Whole Teff Seeds" class=mrg></a> 
[<i>Eragrostis tef</i>] 
<p>
Domesticated Teff has been harvested in Ethiopia for between 3000 and 
6000 years, and is now a minor crop in India and Australia. It is 
increasingly grown in the western United States as a productive and very 
nutritious animal forage crop, alternating with alfalfa in the fields. 
This has made it more available for other uses as well. Ethiopia had a 
long standing ban on exporting Teff to keep it affordable, but 
improvement in agricultural practices allowed that ban to be lifted in 
2015. It is used to make Injera, the regional bread of Ethiopia and 
Eritrea. Teff contains no gluten. <u>Caution</u>: seeds of a mustard 
plant called <a href="cb_londrktz.html">London Rocket</a> are often 
erroneously labeled "Teff". That seed is used in beverages in Iran.

<h2 id="wild">Wild Rice</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_riwild01h.jpg" alt="Grains" class=mrg>
[<i>Zizania palustris</i>, <i>Zizania aquatica</i>]
<p>
I'm tired of reading that "Wild Rice is not actually rice but the seed 
of an annual grass". Well what in hades do they think regular rice is? 
Sheesh! give me a break! Anyway, you'll find wild rice over on the

<h2 id="notgr" class=lrg>"Grains" that aren't Grasses</h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id=amr>Amaranth</h3>
<br>This is not a grain but the seed of an herb related to spinach. It 
has a high yield and easily harvested so its tiny seeds are used as if 
they were grain. Unlike grasses, the leaves are edible and widely used 
for food. Amaranth contains no gluten. For details see our 
<a href="ch_amaranth.html#amaras"><b>Amaranth</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="buck">Buckwheat</h3>
<br>This is not a grain but the seed of a plant related to rhubarb. It is 
highly productive, particularly good in colder climates and is used as if 
it were a grain. Buckwheat contains no gluten. For details see our 
<a href="cn_buckz.html"><b>Buckwheat</b></a> page. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="quin">Quinoa</h3>
<br>Quinoa (pronounced <i>keen-wah</i>), is not a grain but the seed of an 
herb related to Epazote and common Goosefoot. It is high yield and easily 
harvested so its tiny seeds are used as if they were grain. Quinoa 
contains no gluten. For details see our 
<a href="ch_quinoz.html"><b>Quinoa</b></a> page.

<h3>Celiac Disease:</h3> &nbsp; This is a serious degenerative autoimmune 
condition requiring total elimination of gluten proteins from the diet. 
Gluten is contained only in certain grains, so each grain above includes 
a note as to whether it contains gluten or not. For more information
