<h1>Other Grasses</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Most grasses (family <i>Poaceae</i>) are tough and/or toxic, not at all 
edible, except for their seeds and a few sprouts, but a few are valuable 
as seasonings and for other uses.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Other than bamboo and grains, few grasses hold any direct importance 
in our cuisine - mainly Sugar Cane (the largest crop in the world) and 
Lemon Grass, an important flavoring ingredient in Southeast Asian 
cuisines.</p>

<p>Indirectly, other grasses are of great culinary importance as primary 
feed for cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and horses.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Indian Rice Grass</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_indrice01h.jpg" alt="Clump of Indian Rice Grass" class=mrg>
[<i>Oryzopsis hymenoides</i>]<p>Native to western North America from 
east of the Cascades in British Columbia to Southern California and 
northeastern Mexico, this grass grows in clumps up to 24 inches tall and 
12 inches wide. Seeds of this plant were a staple food for the American 
Indians, particularly when other crops failed. Today it is used mainly 
as a decorative in xeriscapes and in flower arrangements.

<h2>Lemon Grass</h2>
<br><a href="gr_lemonz.html">
<img src="img/gr_lemon03d.jpg" alt="Stalks" class=mrg></a>
[Fever Grass, Ta Khrai, Takrai (Thai); Xa, Sa chanh (Viet); Tanglad 
(Philippines); Zabalin (Burma); Si khai, Sing khai (Laos); Bai mak nao, 
Slek krey sabou, Kuel skey (Cambodia);  Sera (Sri Lanka, India); Ghanda, 
Bhustrina (India); Serai (Malaysia); Sereh (Indonesia); Citronella 
(French); <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i> and to a lesser extent other 
<i>Cymbopogon</i> species (or subfamily <i>Panicoideae</i>)]
<p>
<b><i>C. citratus</i></b> is a lemon scented grass native to Southeast Asia. 
It is essential to the cuisines of all of Southeast Asia, including the 
Philippines. It is also used in Sri Lanka, parts of southern China, and 
in the Caribbean, but is not used in cooking in India.</p>

<p><b><i>C. flexuosus</i></b>, intensively grown in India, is mostly 
used for oils, perfumes and medicinals, though it can be used in 
cooking.</p>

<p><b><i>C. nardus</i></b> is the industrial strength version, 
unpalatable to both people and livestock but distilled into citronella 
oils used as insect repellants, antiseptics and flavorings. It is grown 
as a decorative in Florida and California but is a serious and difficult 
to defeat invader of pasture land in Africa.

<h2>Palmiet</h2>
<br>
<img src="img/gr_palmiet01h.jpg" alt="Clump of Grass" class=mrg>
[<i>Prionium serratum</i>]
<p>
This semi-aquatic grass, native to South Africa. Older plants build a 
stalk about 4 inches in diameter, covered with the bases of old leaves, 
with a crest of fresh leaves at the top. It builds dense mats which are 
very important to erosion and flood water control. Early Dutch settlers 
in South Africa used young shoots of this plant in salads.

<h2 id="sweet">Sweet Grass</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_sweet01h.jpg" alt="Field" class=mrg>
[Buffalo grass, Bison grass, Vanilla grass, Mary's grass, Seneca grass; 
Holy grass (UK); <i>Hierochloe odorata</i>]
<p>
Native though both North America and northern Eurasia, this grass 
is much liked by both the American Buffalo and the European Bison. Among 
humans it has been widely used in ceremonies - today particularly by 
American Indians as a purifying incense. Braids of sweet grass can be 
ordered from numerous emporiums supplying gear for pagan rituals and it 
is recommended for purifying rooms before ceremonies just as sage is 
used.</p>

<p>Sweet grass also finds considerable use for weaving baskets and for 
flavoring alcoholic beverages, particularly Polish Zubr&oacute;wka Vodka. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declared sweetgrass toxic and 
has banned import of Zubr&oacute;wka except in an artificial version made 
with chemical flavorings, "for our protection".

<h2 id="scane">Sugar Cane</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_sugar01f.jpg" alt="Sections of Cane" class=mrg>
[<i>Saccharum officinarum</i> (and some other species)]
<p>
Native to southern India and Southeast Asia, sugar cane is now grown in 
the tropics worldwide and is the world's largest crop. Total world 
production is nearly 1-3/4 billion tons per year. It is a multi-stemmed 
grass that grows to about 13 feet high with stems up to 2 inches in 
diameter.  The stems are about 15% sugar.</p>

<p>Cultivation is thought to have begun in in New Guinea about 8000 
years ago, and by 5000 years ago it was grown by the Indus valley 
civilizations. While the ancient Greeks knew of it, it was not grown 
west of Pakistan until around 1300 years ago when Arab traders brought 
it from Southeast Asia to the Near East, North Africa and Spain. Today, 
Brazil is the top producer by a wide margin, followed by India and 
China. It is also very important to the economies of the Caribbean 
islands.</p>

<a href="sweet.html"><b>Sweeteners</b></a> page.

<br>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Of the grasses on this page, none presents much of a health or 
nutrition impact except sugar cane - and it's impact is almost entirely 
negative. Evolution programmed humans to seek out sweets, which were 
very rare in nature. Unfortunately sweets are not at all rare in our 
food processing industry, and this predilection for them works seriously 
against our good health. Obesity, diabetes, tooth decay, vulnerability 
to infectious diseases, and organ failures are the result.
