<h1>RICE</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg>Rice is the seed of an annual marsh grass (<i>Oryza 
sativa</i>) belonging to family <i>Poaceae</i> (true grasses) and native 
to India and Southeast Asia.</span> In large parts of this region, 
including Indonesia and much of China, it is the main course for almost 
every meal (all other dishes are sides and condiments for the rice). It 
is one of the most protein complete grains but still needs some beans or 
other protein sources to complement it.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>


<p><img src="img/ri_rice02k.jpg" alt="Rice Seed Heads" class=mrg>
Domesticated Asian (as distinct from African) rice derives from Asian wild 
red rice, <i>Oryza rufipogon</i>, which still exists and is a difficult 
to eradicate pest in commercial crops. This wild rice can still 
crossbreed with domesticated rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) providing any 
number of intentional and unintentional hybrids. <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> 
is thought native to India and Southeast Asia, but the oldest accepted 
evidence of rice cultivation is from China, about 5000 BCE.

<p>African rice (<i>Oryza glaberrima</i>), also known as "upland rice", 
can withstand drier conditions and is resistant to pests found in Africa. 
Domesticated versions are closer to wild than Asian rice, yields are much 
lower and harvesting is more difficult. It has been isolated from Asian 
rice for so long it is extremely difficult to hybridize the two, though 
that has recently been accomplished. Hybrids are called NERICA (New Rice 
for Africa) and are now being widely planted for improved yields. African 
rice is grown mainly in humid parts of West Africa.</p>

<p>Arab traders brought Asian rice from India to the Near East, and then 
on to Spain. From Spain it was taken to Italy, but the rest of Europe is 
unsuitable for rice cultivation.</p>

<p>Rice came to North America in colonial days. It is said that a ship 
out of Madagascar was damaged in a storm and put into Charleston, South 
Carolina for repairs. The captain thanked his hosts with a bag of Patna 
type rice, which was successfully planted using the rice growing skills 
of slaves from West Africa. From this grew a major rice cultivation and 
exporting business. Unfortunately for South Carolina, its growing practices 
were very much dependant on slave labor, and disregard for health of the 
slaves, so rice production declined rapidly after the Civil war. Today, 
rice is grown mainly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, but any 
relationship to the original Carolina rice is highly questionable. Real 
<a href="ri_amerz.html#carol"><b>Carolina Rice</b></a> has been revived 
by a boutique grower.</p>

<p>While rice consumption is relatively low in North America, it has 
been rising to the point that around 75% of households now serve rice at 
least once a week, up from around 45% in the mid 70s. This large increase 
is partially due to immigration from rice eating cultures who not only 
consume rice themselves but influence the diversity of what other 
Americans eat.</p>

<p>Rice has, until recently, been little exported, most being consumed in 
the area where it is grown. Most rice growing cultures don't even like 
the types of rice that come from other regions. The exception has been the 
United States, which started exporting quantities of rice in colonial 
days. Today several other countries are major exporters. Thailand has 
long been the biggest exporter, but in 2012 it dropped to third due to a 
Thai government program. The current order by volume is: India (by a very 
wide margin - 15.5 million metric tons), Vietnam and Thailand (nearly tied), 
Pakistan, and the United States. In general, exporting countries 
export the types of rice their own people prefer. The US exports around 
half it's rice production, mostly long grain to Mexico, the Caribbean and 
Canada and South America
mainly Japanese style rice.</p> 

<p>The US exports about 3.6 million US Tons, and imports more than 
1.6 million US tons of rice per year (2019). The imports have increased by 
more than three times over the last decade. This is all Aromatic Rice, 
Thai Jasmine and Basmati from India and Pakistan. China is currently (2021) 
dumping surplus government stocks of old medium grain rice to US Puerto Rico 
at below market prices.</p>

<h3>Paddy Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/ri_paddy01h.jpg" alt="Paddy Rice Grains" class=mrg>
This is rice as threshed from the grass and includes husk and bran. The 
final weight of milled white rice is about 68% of it's weight as paddy 
rice. If the rice is to be parboiled, it is used in this condition.

<h3>Brown Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_ribasmb06h.jpg" alt="Brown Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg>
This is rice that has gone through the first step of milling to remove the 
husks, but the bran coating and germ are still on the grains. Brown rice 
is more nutritious than white milled rice (fiber, protein, vitamins, 
minerals and anti-oxidants) and it has a nutty flavor and chewy texture. 
On the downside, the flavor is less delicate than white rice making it 
unsuitable for many recipes, cooking time is much longer, and it is far 
more vulnerable to rancidity. Storage time can be as little as a few 
months while white rice can store from one year to more than 50 years 
depending on variety and milling practice.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Cargo Rice</h3>
<br>This is a term some manufacturers and countries use for brown rice. 
Rice is shipped mostly brown, thus "cargo", to countries that do not allow 
import of milled rice in order to protect their own milling industry. 
Other countries refuse to ship Cargo Rice in order to protect their milling 
industry.<p></p>

<h3>White Rice</h3>
<br>This is brown rice run through an additional milling process to remove 
the bran and germ. Most of the rice consumption in all countries is white 
rice, preferred for its delicate flavor and short cooking time. When white 
rice first became cheap enough for normal people to buy, the vitamin 
deficiency disease <a href="gr_rice.html#health"><b>Beriberi</b></a> became widespread 
in regions that lived mostly on rice.
<p></p>

<h3>Converted Rice</h3>
<br>This is an American form of Parboiled Rice, originated by the company now 
known a Mars. The original production was to create a more durable, weevil 
resistant and more nutritious rice with a shorter cooking time as supplies 
for troops during World War II. After the war it was marketed as 
"Uncle Ben's<small>&reg;</small>", which became a popular American retail 
brand. Most rice articles in North America say "converted" rice was invented 
by Uncle Ben's, but the concept was not, only details of the Huzenlaub 
process, which was invented in England. The Huzenlaub process takes more 
complex equipment than the Indian process because it uses vacuum drying at 
two stages. The brand is now "Ben's Original<small>&reg;</small>". as 
"Uncle Ben" was considered racist. "Uncle" was a title used in the South to 
avoid calling a black man "Mr.".
<p></p>

<h3 id="parb">Parboiled Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribassel03h.jpg" alt="Sella Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
[Sella rice (India)]
<p>In this process the rice is still in the husk when the grains are 
soaked, steamed (formerly boiled) and then dried. After that it is 
milled into white rice the usual way, but is somewhat yellow in color. 
This process drives a good part of the nutrients from the bran coat into 
the rice body making a white rice with more vitamins, makes the rice 
more durable during the milling process, and the grains stay more 
separate with cooking.</p>
<p>This process was originally adopted in India to improve cheaper grades 
of rice. Parboiled grains stay fluffy and very separate even if the rice it 
is prepared from would otherwise be stickier. Parboiled rice is now much 
used as "restaurant rice" because it is less vulnerable to improper cooking 
and handling. In restaurants serving risotto, it often cooked most of the 
way, then cooled. To fill orders, it is then finish cooked. It also holds 
up well in canned and processed foods.</p>
<p>American parboiled rice is processed to a very pale color and cooks 
out almost pure white. Indian parboiled rice is often darker, cooking 
out with more color and has a little more of a brown rice flavor. The 
photo specimens are of Indian Basmati Sela parboiled rice.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>"Instant" Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_riinstant01h.jpg" alt="Grains" class=mrg>
[Precooked Rice]<p>
This is rice (usually American long grain) that has been fully cooked 
and then dehydrated before packaging. It's easily identified because The 
grains are soft, gritty in texture, and many are broken. After "cooking" 
for the recommended time of 5 minutes the grains are still a bit dry, 
slightly gritty, stiff in the center and a bit mushy on the outside. 
Give it 10 minutes and it's mushy all the way through. The fragrance 
and flavor are similar to styrofoam. Inferior in nutrition, flavor and 
texture, this product is unsuitable for just about any purpose, except 
perhaps to accurately reproduce the cuisine of New Jersey during the 
Eisenhower administration - but you can microwave it. "Minute Rice" is 
a well known brand.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Coated Rice</h3>
<br>This is white rice that has been given a coating as a preservative and 
anti-caking agent. Coating with Talc was once common practice to protect 
rice on long sea voyages but can now be found only in a few ethnic rice 
varieties, possibly in South America - it is illegal in the United States. 
This rice must be clearly labeled as coated and must be thoroughly rinsed 
before use. Today, rice may be coated with cornstarch, which is edible and 
need not be labeled, but for most uses should be rinsed off as it will 
affect the texture.
<p></p>

<h3>"No-Rinse" Rice:</h3>
<br>[Musenmai rice] &nbsp; This rice has a special coating that looks rather 
shiny. I have not tried it, in fact I haven't even seen it, but it is 
reported by experts to be deficient in flavor.
<p></p>

<h3>Broken Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/ri_broken01h.jpg" alt="Broken Rice Grains" class=mrg>
The milling process breaks a lot of rice grains, which must be sorted out 
from the whole grain rice. US regulations call for no more than 4% broken 
grains in commercial rice. Broken rice is sold mostly to food processors, 
pet food makers, and beer brewers, but in West Africa and Southeast Asia it 
is also a consumer product. It is sometimes called for in rice puddings and 
similar recipes. It is quite popular in West Africa because it costs less, 
and can be substituted for couscous because of similar size and shape.

<h3>Puffed Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_ripuff05h.jpg" alt="Puffed Rice Grains" class=mrg>
This product is made by two different processes: "oven puffing", where 
the grains are exposed to a very high temperature, and "gun puffing", 
where the grains are heated moderately under high pressure. When the 
pressure is released the rice puffs up. The two processes provide a 
somewhat different product. Puffed rice is very popular in India for 
use in sweets and deserts. They use the oven method and fuel the ovens 
with burning rubber tires to get a high enough temperature - with a 
serious negative impact on health and environment. The photo specimens 
are from India, probably oven puffed. American puffed rice (gun puffed) 
is a bit lighter, whiter and more consistent. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="beat">Beaten Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_riflake04h.jpg" alt="White Rice Flakes" class=mrg>
[Rice Flakes, Pounded Rice; Poha (India); Choora (India, Northeast)]
<p>This product is popular in India. The grains are flattened into flakes 
and dried, making a product that cooks very quickly - an attractive 
feature in a region where cooking fuel is extremely expensive.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ground Rice</h3>
<br><img src="img/ri_grnd02h.jpg" alt="Ground White Rice" class=mrg>
For this product, white rice is ground to a much coarser degree than is rice 
flour, similar to Wheat Farina. It is used for porridge like dishes. 
"Cream of Rice<small>&reg;</small>"  is a trademark for Nabisco's ground 
rice for porridge.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Rice Flour</h3>
This flour is generally white rice ground very fine, or it can be ground 
from puffed rice (easier). It can also be ground from brown rice, but brown 
rice flour will become rancid much more quickly, just as with whole wheat 
flour. Rice flour is used in confections, as a thickening agent in sauces, 
and in industrial processed food.
<p><u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; This flour comes in two varieties, regular rice 
and glutenous (sweet) rice. They are often used in different ways. In 
general, you want the regular version, but sauces thickened with sweet 
rice flour are more resistant to breaking down with heat than those 
thickened with regular rice flour. Because it varies significantly depending 
on the type of rice used, it is safest to get a variety of the same ethnicity 
as the recipes you will be cooking.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="starch" class=lrg>Starches <small>in</small> Rice</h2>

<p><span class=bg><u>Starches have a great effect on the cooking 
properties of rice</u>.</span> The "white" part of the rice grain is 
nearly all starch. As with other culinary starches, they are composed 
of two kinds of glucose chains: <i>amylose</i> and <i>amylopectin</i>. 
The ratio of these two components influences cooking properties.</p>

<p>Rice high in <i>amylose</i> tends to cook into separate, fairly 
firm grains. It also has a lightly lower GI (glycemic index) than 
other rice.</p>

<p>Rice high in <i>amylopectin</i> cooks up softer, absorbing more 
water, and the grains tend to stick to each other. These rices will 
keep absorbing water and swelling until they become a gel.</p>

<p>Here are the general rules for commonly marketed rice varieties. 
Relatively small variations in the ratio of amylose to amylopectin 
can significantly affect cooking properties. There are exceptions 
to these rules with some special varieties. For instance Thai Sticky 
Rice, unlike all other common sticky rices, is long grain.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Long Grain:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>indica</i>) &nbsp;  Properly cooked, 
this rice is "fluffy" with very separate grains. This is the predominant 
rice in India, Southeast Asia and major parts of China, particularly 
the southern two thirds. It is commonly around 22% amylose, but can 
be up to 25%.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Medium Grain:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>japonica</i>) &nbsp; Properly 
cooked, this rice also produces rather separate grains, but they adhere 
to each other, making it easier to pick up lumps of it with the pointy 
chopsticks used in Japan. It is also good for sushi, and is the 
predominant rice in Japan and Korea. It is not good for soups or stews, 
because it continues to swell until it is a gel. It is often wrongly 
called "short grain". It is usually between 15% and 17% amylose.<p></p>
</li> 
<li><h3>Short Grain:</h3> &nbsp; (<i>japonica</i>) &nbsp; This type 
includes varieties known as "glutenous rice" (which contains no gluten), 
"sticky rice", "waxy rice"  and "sweet rice". Most short grain rice cooks 
up very sticky, and, except in Laos and Issan, Thailand, is used mainly 
for sweets and deserts, thus the name - the rice itself is no sweeter 
than any other. The amylose content is always below 15% and can be as 
low as 2%.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Safety:</h3> &nbsp; There are few risks involved with rice beyond 
slipping on thrown rice at a wedding (a custom adopted from India). If 
left out too long (more than a day) cooked rice will sour but not 
generally become toxic.

<p>Here in Los Angeles there was a great rice war between the food safety 
officials and the Asians. It was over not refrigerating rice cakes 
(refrigeration ruins them). A compromise was finally worked out so they 
need not be refrigerated but there is a fixed number of hours they may 
be out for sale (rice cakes usually include ingredients other than rice in 
the center).</p>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp;  Rice is high in carbohydrates, gluten free, 
very low in fat and sodium and has about the best protein balance 
of any common grain, with all 8 essential amino acids present in reasonable 
proportions (somewhat short on lysine though). Brown, red and black rice 
contain more vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, as described 
below. The number of calories in a cup of cooked rice and Glycemic Index 
depends on type and weight. Here are typical weights and counts.<p></p>

<h3>Diabetes:</h3> &nbsp;  Inconclusive. &nbsp; In March 2012 a Harvard 
group published a meta-study in medical journal BMJ that found a barely 
statistically valid association for type 2 diabetes increasing with 
increasing consumption of white rice.

<p>Even EMJ's editors stated "Although the findings of the current study 
are interesting they have few immediate implications for doctors, 
patients, or public health services . . . ". That's about the kindest 
evaluation of the study. Looked at another way, their data showed the 
increase in diabetes was valid only for Asians, not Westerners - but, 
basically, it wasn't valid enough to come to any conclusions at all 
(<a href="gr_rice.html#r06">R6</a>).</p>

<p>This did not stop the media from running with the story with huge 
and alarming headlines linking white rice consumption to type 2 diabetes, 
carefully omitting any parts that questioned the validity and relevance 
of the data.</p>

<p>In any case, long grain rice has a lower GI (glycemic index) than 
medium and short grain rice.</p>

<h3>Arsenic:</h3> &nbsp; (2010) &nbsp; Rice from the US Southern States 
has been found a bit high in arsenic, probably from fertilization with 
chicken droppings. You did know chickens and turkeys were (and some may 
still be) fed arsenic, right? Makes 'em grow faster. Extent of risk is 
under evaluation by the FDA. California, Thai and Indian rice have normal 
arsenic levels.<p></p>

<h3>Brown Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This form is more nutritious than white 
rice since the bran layers contain protein, calcium, phosphorus, 
potassium, B vitamins, fiber and vitamin E (as well as some toxins and 
"anti-nutrients"), while the white part is mostly just starch. It is 
also much higher in iron and selenium than white rice, and higher in 
antioxidants, but not nearly so high as red rice, and that isn't nearly 
as high as black rice, because the colors come from anthocyanin 
antioxidants.<p></p>

<h3>Beriberi:</h3> &nbsp; When a cheap milling process was developed, 
rice subsistent people wanted white rice just like rich people had 
long enjoyed. Unfortunately, this resulted in the debilitating B vitamin 
deficiency disease beriberi. A nutritional fix was found, but the medical 
profession was totally hung up on microbial theories of disease back 
then, so doctors continued to search for "the real cause" long after.

<p>Beriberi was a serious problem in the southeast U.S. as well, so the 
US Food and Drug Administration requires "enrichment" of white rice with 
niacin, thiamin and iron. This is washed off if you rinse the rice which 
is why the package says "don't rinse". Recipes say "do rinse" (for better 
texture) and few of us are so rice subsistent the loss will make a 
significant difference. More serious is lack of iodine from using 
kosher salt. Because a few people think they can taste the iodine, all 
recipes written today demand kosher salt - and they <u>never</u> tell 
you if their measure is for Morton or Diamond Crystal (by measure, you 
need about twice as much Diamond Crystal as Morton due to its light 
texture).</p>

<h3>Gluten:</h3> &nbsp; No rice, including "Glutinous Rice" contains 
any gluten and all are suitable for celiac sufferers. Rice flour is used 
for baked goods and otherwise as a substitute for wheat flour for the 
gluten intolerant. Unfortunately, without gluten, it can not make a risen 
dough bread.<p></p>
