Rice is a major part of the diet for much of the world. It is better 
suited for human nutrition than any other grain, comes in many 
varieties and can be cooked in many ways. Each region where it is 
used has selected varieties suited to it's needs, and cooking methods 
suited to the chosen varieties.  Here we provide a quick overview.

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Rice</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These days you go to a store that sells the kind 
of rice you want to cook and buy a bag. I usually buy 10 pound bags of 
common varieties of white rice, but 5 pound bags of brown rice that must 
be used more quickly. Well, yes, in some Red States you may have to 
order the more exotic ethnic varieties on the Internet. When you get 
really experienced you may develop a strong preference for particular 
brands of particular varieties of rice.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; You need to store rice in an air-tight container 
in a cool dry place. The "air tight" is to keep bugs out - note that 
they can bore through thin plastic bags, you need 2-mil minimum to keep 
them out. If you notice tiny black dots in the rice, those are beetles. 
If there aren't too many you can shake the rice in a wire strainer and 
the beetles, being far smaller than rice grains, will fall through. 
Also, most bugs are lighter than rice, so you can float them out. It's 
not that the bugs aren't nutritious, but some of your guests may be a 
little squeamish on this mater. especially the vegans.

<p>White rice can last 1 year to 50 years depending on milling and 
variety. Brown rice is highly variable. Some will go rancid in just a 
few months (depending also on how long it as stored before you bought 
it) and others will last a year or more. If you smell rancidity, 
discard it. Products of rancidity, besides smelling bad and tasting 
awful, are suspected carcinogens.</p>

<p>In India, top grade Basmati rice is sometimes aged for as much as 50 
years (and becomes very high in price). The aging is done in the husk, 
and the rice is milled before packaging and selling. The longer the age 
the fluffier the rice will be when cooked (though beyond 2 years you are 
looking at a steeply diminishing return on investment). For this kind 
of storage you need a container that will allow limited air 
circulation but still exclude tiny bugs. Most "Aged Basmati" sold in 
North America is aged for one year.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="class" class=lrg>Classes <small>&amp;</small> Varieties 
<small>of</small> Rice</h2>

<p>For more than you ever wanted to know about Classes and Varieties of 
rice, visit our <a href="gr_rice.html"><b>RICE</b></a> page - but here 
are a few commonly found in North American kitchens (any of these can be 
found in brown as well as white):<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Thai Jasmine:</b> &nbsp; An aromatic long grain rice suitable for 
cuisines of North America, non-Mediterranean Europe, Southeast Asia (including 
the Philippines) and southern China.</li>
 
<li><b>Indian Basmati:</b> &nbsp; An aromatic very long grain rice best for cuisines 
of India, Persia, Anatolia, the Near and Middle East and anywhere pilafs are 
made,</li>

<li><b>California Rice:</b> &nbsp; Japanese style rice. The most common 
is Calrose, but I prefer Kokuho Rose. Use this rice for the cuisines of 
Japan, Korea and northern China. In a pinch it'll do for Italian, but 
more questionable for Spanish.</li>

<li><b>Long Grain Rice:</b> &nbsp; What rice is for most in North 
America. It's a fairly undistinguished Patna type rice originating 
from around Patna in India. Major growing regions are in the US South, 
primarily Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Any relationship to  the 
famous Carolina rice is questionable.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking Rice</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="steamc">Conventional Steaming</h2>

<p>As far as I'm concerned. this is the way to cook plain rice, 
though some ethnicities and households insist on other methods. This 
method can be used with either a sauce pan (for 1 to 4 servings) or an 
Asian rice cooker (larger batches). Note that the times and measures 
give here are specific to white rice. Brown, red and black rice take 
somewhat to a lot longer, and more water. See our 
<a href="gr_rice.html#var"><b>RICE</b></a> page for details on specific 
varieties.</p>

<p>This method does demand that you know your rice, your pan and your 
stove very well - or your rice and your rice cooker for larger batches. 
A little practice is needed to get these things down perfect.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rinse your rice by measuring it into a fine mesh strainer and shaking 
  it briskly under hot running water. Let it drain well, and then tilt 
  the strainer a bit to get it thoroughly drained.</li>
<li>Pour a dab of olive oil into the saucepan and wipe it around the 
  bottom and sides with a small bit of paper towel. Sprinkle in some salt, 
  depending on ethnicity of the meal. No or very little salt for Southeast 
  Asia and Japan, a little more salt for India, China, Europe and North 
  America. Brown, red and black rice need more salt than white rice to 
  taste right.</li>
<li>Pour in the drained rice.</li>
<li>Measure in <u>cold</u> water appropriate for the type of rice and the 
  amount being made (a little more for very small batches). At this point 
  we have three possibilities: 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Rice Cooker:</b> &nbsp; Cover and push the button. It will shift 
    to "warm" mode when the rice is done. When done, let it sit for at 
    least 10 minutes. How does it know when the rice is done? When all 
    the free water is gone the temperature at the bottom of the pot will 
    start to rise. At a preset temperature it turns to "warm" (or off 
    for my antique Hitachi rice cooker - I have to push the "warm" button 
    by hand).</li>
  <li><b>Saucepan:</b> &nbsp; Bring to a boil uncovered (this is so you 
    can see when it reaches a boil - covered you'll forget). The moment 
    it boils cut the heat to barely a simmer and cover tightly. In about 
    15 to 20 minutes turn off the heat entirely and let sit for about 10 
    minutes.
    </li>
  <li><b>Saucepan:</b> &nbsp; This is the method I use, and I most often 
    use it for as little as a single serving (1/3 cup rice). Set the pot, 
    tightly covered, on a cold burner, preferably a solid iron one or 
    with a heat spreader. Set flame to the point where a fairly strong 
    simmer would be maintained (just the center flame on my burner). At 
    exactly 25 minutes (your time may vary) I turn it off and let it sit 
    for about 10 minutes.</li>
  </ul>
  </ol>
<p>Note that the 10 minute rest period is important to properly 
distribute moisture, and it will also allow the rice to come unstuck 
from the pan.</p>


<h2 id="nuke">Microwave Steaming</h2>

<p>Science has shown that "nuking" food does far more damage to its 
nutritional value than conventional cooking. Nonetheless, households with 
children (including often husbands) demanding instant gratification 
consider a microwave essential. I haven't tried this, having no 
microwave (or children), but the instructions given here are widely 
published.  The microwave is said to work very well - easy, almost 
foolproof - and the rice won't stick to the bowl or burn. Naturally, 
as with every other rice cooking method you need to adjust the water 
and cooking time to your exact rice and the power of your microwave.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Long Grain, Medium Grain and Uncle Ben's "Converted" Rice:</b> 
  &nbsp; Use 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water or broth in a 3-quart 
  microwave container. Cover with wax paper and microwave on high for 
  5 minutes, then on medium for about 13 minutes.</li>
<li><b>Brown Rice</b> &nbsp; Use 1 cup of rice and 3 cups of water or 
  broth in a 3-quart microwave container. Cover with wax paper and 
  microwave on high for 8 minutes, then on medium for about 20 minutes.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steams">Steamed Sticky / Glutinous / Sweet Rice</h2>

<p><img src="../ke/img/ke_swrice03k.jpg" alt="Rice Steamer" class=mrg>
Laotians (including the Laotian people in Issan, Thailand) and the 
Tai Khuen of eastern Shan State, Burma, are the only peoples where 
sweet / glutinous rice is the main rice. In other cultures it is mostly 
reserved for sweets. Glutinous rice is much favored in Laos for it's 
ability to be made up into wads used to pick up sauces and other 
foods. A wad of rice is their main, and often only, eating utensil. 
Properly made, the finished rice should be quite dry, but very 
sticky.</p>

<p>This rice is traditionally made in a steamer of the type shown in the 
photo. Both parts were purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles, 
and the lid borrowed from a convenient pot. Other steamers can be used 
if you don't have this rig.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> &nbsp; Purchase Thai or Laotian <u>long grain sweet rice</u> 
  (not all sweet rice is suitable). This is easily available on-line or 
  in the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles.
<br><b>2.</b> &nbsp; Rinse the rice well until the water runs clear
<br><b>3.</b> &nbsp; Soak the rice in water to cover by a couple of 
  inches. Soaking time depends on the age of the rice, 4 to 8 hours. If 
  it came from Thailand to North America, it is probably old enough by 
  now to take the full 8 hours or overnight.
<br><b>4.</b> &nbsp; Wrap the rice in cheese cloth. Some on-line outlets 
  that sell the rice and steamers have wide Thai cheesecloth suitable for 
  this use.
<br><b>5.</b> &nbsp; Load the steamer with the wrapped rice and put a lid 
  over it. If using the official cone shaped basket, make sure the basket 
  doesn't touch the boiling water.
<br><b>6.</b> &nbsp; Bring to a boil and steam at a light boil until 
  tender, about 45 minutes.
<br><b>7.</b> &nbsp; Remove the rice from the cheese cloth and 
  wash the cloth for future use.
<br class=cll>
<img src="../ke/img/ks_ricebsk01c.jpg" alt="Thai Rice Basket" class=mrg>
  <br>Sticky Rice is immediately removed from the steamer into one or more 
  covered Rice Baskets and sent to the table. These baskets may be of 
  individual or family sizes. The inner chamber of the photo specimen 
  basket is 4-1/2 inches diameter and will hold 4 cups of rice. The 
  string serves to keep the lid with the basket and to hang the 
  basket from a convenient hook.  Baskets of this sort are available 
  on the Internet, shipped directly from Thailand.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="steamp">Pilaf Rice</h2>

<p>Pilafs are the main way of cooking rice in Anatolia and from North 
Africa through the Near and Middle East, Persia (where it originated), 
Central Asia, and northwestern India. A modified form can be found in 
some parts of Italy and southern France.</p>
<p>There are actually a number of variations on the pilaf method, but 
this one works pretty well for me. Pilaf is a little tricky because you 
have to get the water just right from the start, and there's no way to 
correct it later. This takes some practice to get just right. so don't 
plan to serve your first try to important guests.</p>
<p>If there are other major ingredients I usually do this in a 3-1/2 
quart multi-ply saut&eacute; pan with a tight fitting lid, using 1 cup 
of rice and a bit shy of 2 cups of water (or broth if the recipe calls 
for that). If there are no other major ingredients a 2 quart saut&eacute; 
pan works better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chose a very long grain Basmati type rice, Lacking that, Thai Jasmine 
  rice, or lacking even that, an American long grain rice can be used 
  (but   not "converted" rice), though it will not have that desirable 
  basmati aroma. Try to always use the same type of rice, the same pan 
  and the same stove burner the same way once you get the amount of 
  liquid and the timing just right.</li>
<li>Rinse the rice well, then soak in warmish water for 1/2 hour or a 
  little longer.</li>
<li>Most pilafs have other ingredients than rice. At this point you fry 
  up the other ingredients, or prepare them however the recipe calls for. 
  This preparation should end with no free liquid in the pan.</li>
<li>Drain rice very well.  Stir it into the pan with the required amount 
  of water, and some butter (about 1 T per cup of rice).</li>
<li>Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to a slow simmer. Cover 
  tightly and let cook for about 12 minutes (your timing may vary). 
  Do not open the lid until the time is up.</li>
<li>Turn off heat. Open the lid and drape a paper towel over the pan, 
  then return the lid and let stand for a good 10 minutes (the paper 
  towel is to keep water from dripping off the lid into the rice).</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="steamr">Risotto Rice</h2>

<p>Risotto is primarily made in northern Italy, but some also in southern 
France. I usually do this in a 2 quart saut&eacute; pan using 1 cup 
rice, 1 T of olive oil or butter and just shy of 2 cups broth.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Do Not Rinse</b> or pre-soak rice used for risotto. Starch 
  adhering to the surface of the grains is important to the end result.
  </li>
<li>Select a medium grain Risotto type rice at least 6 months old 
  (Carnaroli, Maratelli and Vialone Nano are considered best, Arborio 
  not so much - too touchy). Lacking that, a medium grain Egyptian or 
  Spanish rice, or a California rice such as Kokuho Rose or Calrose can 
  be used, with somewhat less authentic results.</li>
<li>Chop ingredients for a <i>soffritto</i> if the recipe calls for one. 
  At minimum some onion, but garlic, celery and parsley are often 
  included.</li>
<li>Heat some olive oil or butter in the risotto pan (about 1 T per cup 
  of rice) Fry the <i>soffritto</i> (if any) until onion is translucent. 
  Add the rice and fry stirring for about another 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add half the broth called for by the recipe. Stir as you add the broth 
  and very often as the broth is absorbed. As needed stir in half the 
  remaining broth and continue stirring very often until the rice 
  is creamy and tender (when only 1/4 cup of broth remains, you are 
  permitted to stir it all in - otherwise you will never finish).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="paella">Spanish Rice - Paella <small>&amp;</small> 
Arroz</h2>

<p>In Spain, where rice cultivation was first introduced into Europe, 
rice is cooked differently from the rest of the world - in an open pan, 
with no stirring. Cooked in a shallow stove top pan it is "Paella". 
Cooked in an earthenware <i>cazuela</i>, in the oven or on the stove 
top, it is "Arroz".</p>
<p>The proper Paella pan is a shallow pan with sloping sides made from 
regular steel (the kind that rusts). La Espanola Meats carries these in 
14 sizes from 9-1/3 inches to 51-1/4 inches (1 plaza to 200 plazas). 
Stainless pans are available, but not as good due to the poor heat 
conductivity of stainless.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a "Valencia", "Bomba" or "Calasparra" paella rice. These are 
  super absorbent medium grain rice varieties particularly suited to the 
  Spanish methods of cooking. They can be purchased from on-line 
  sources such as La Espanola Meats of Harbor City, CA (Los Angeles) or 
  La Tienda of Williamsberg, VA, Amazon.com and many others.</li>
<li><b>DO NOT</b> rinse or soak rice for paella or Arroz.</li>
<li>Generally the recipe will call for a bunch of other ingredients. 
  These are cooked in the pan first, fried, then simmered, and will 
  produce an amount of broth for cooking the rice. Note: in Spain 
  meats and seafood are <u>never</u> both included in the same 
  paella.</li>
<li>When the other ingredients are ready, stir in the rice, about half 
  the volume of rice as there is broth in the pan (adjust broth if 
  necessary).  
<li>Simmer uncovered until rice is cooked tender. Do not disturb the 
  pan until the rice is done. The result should be sticky, but all 
  separate grains, not creamy as in risotto.</li>
</ol>
