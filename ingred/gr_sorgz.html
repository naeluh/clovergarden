[Milo, Broom Straw, Egyptian Millet, Sudan Grass, Feterita, Shallu, 
Kaffir Corn, Guinea Corn; Durra (Arabic); Jola, Jowari, Jawari, Juwar 
(India); Gao-liang, Shushu (China); <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]
<p>
The first firm evidence of cultivated sorghum comes from India and Pakistan 
from before 1000 BCE - but it is not native there. It is now thought to have 
been first cultivated in Sudan, 4000 to 5000 BCE. Modern cultivars appear to 
have been developed in East Africa about 2000 years ago but exactly where has 
not been determined. It is still grown as a food crop over much of the world 
and is the 5th most cultivated grain worldwide.</p>

<p>The U.S. is the largest producer (mainly for animal feed and ethanol 
production). It was a $1 billion export market for US growers until the 
Trump Administration screwed everything up and China retaliated. It is also 
a major crop in India, Nigeria, Mexico and other countries with dry areas.</p>

<p>Sorghum is also the source of "broom corn", the straw from which brooms 
are made, and is used to make composition board for construction. The photo 
specimens, about 0.17 inch diameter, were taken from a bag of pigeon feed. 
The pigeons, for their part, would rather have less sorghum and more peas.

<p>In some regions sorghum replaces barley for production of beer, including 
by major name breweries in regions where barley doesn't grow well. It is also 
used for production of "gluten free" beer consumable by celiac sufferers. 
In China sorghum is used for production of distilled alcoholic drinks and 
vinegar.</p>

<p>In India, puffed sorghum is a popular snack. In China it is used with 
wheat in production of noodles and breads.</p>

<p>In the American South sorghum syrup made from a cultivar called 
"sweet sorghum" has long been used for pouring over pancakes as maple 
syrup is used in the north, though that usage is declining.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Whole grain Sorghum is easily available in North 
America, from markets serving Asian, African, or Latin American communities.
<p></p>

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; While not as nutritious 
as Wheat and Millet, Sorghum is high in  phenolic acids and flavonoids which 
have strong antioxidant activity. It is thought that this may contribute to 
the lower rates of certain cancer in regions that eat a lot of sorghum. It 
also contains no gluten, so is safe for celiac sufferers.
