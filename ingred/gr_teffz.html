[Williams Lovegrass, Annual Bunch Grass; Taf (Amharic); Xaafii (Oromo); 
<i>Eragrostis tef</i>]
<p>
This grain is widely grown in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and is used to make the 
bread of the region, <a href="bk_africae.html"><b>Injera</b></a>. It is a 
variety of Lovegrass, related to Millet, but with very small grains, averaging 
about 0.020 inch wide (0.5 mm) and about 0.039 inches long (1 mm). It takes 
about 100 grains to equal the weight of 1 grain of wheat. Despite this small 
size, the grains are prolific enough to be worth harvesting. It is grown in 
both ivory and brown varieties, with farmers reporting most of their 
customers prefer the ivory. The brown is most common in North America, but the 
ivory is also grown.</p>

<p>Domesticated Teff has been harvested in Ethiopia for between 3000 and 
6000 years, and is now a minor crop in India and Australia. It is 
increasingly grown in the western United States as a productive and very 
nutritious animal forage crop, alternating with alfalfa in the fields. 
This has made it more available for other uses as well. Ethiopia had a 
long standing ban on exporting Teff to keep it affordable, but improvement 
in agricultural practices allowed that ban to be lifted in 2015. </p>

In Ethiopia and Eritrea this grain is used to make 
<a href="bk_africae.html"><b>Injera</b></a>, the bread of the 
region. It is also the main ingredient in Tella, the beer of the 
region, combined with Sorghum and Gesho 
(<a href="bt_bkthorn.html#shiny">Shiny-Leaf Buckthorn</a>) as an 
antimicrobial bitter.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Teff Seed and Flour are available from a number of 
sources for roughly 2021 US $7.95 / pound. <b>Caution:</b> there is another 
seed that looks very similar and is often labeled "Teff", but is totally 
unrelated - it is seed of <a href="cb_londrktz.html"><b>London 
Rocket</b></a>, a wild mustard plant, used in beverages in Iran, and now 
growing as a widespread invasive here in Southern California.<p></p>
