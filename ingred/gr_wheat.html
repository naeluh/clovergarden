Several members of genus <i>Triticum</i> were among the first crops to 
be grown as humans started to transition from hunter-gatherer cultures to 
settled agricultural communities, probably so they could make beer. 
Domesticated varieties were developed for desirable traits, particularly 
large grains and seed heads that didn't "shatter".</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The <i>Triticum</i> genus is genetically complex and include 
hybridization with genus <i>Aegilops</i> (goat grass). Much of this 
hybridization occurred naturally in pre-agricultural times, but the 
hybridization that produced today's common wheat happened naturally - 
in farmer's fields.</p>
<p>This complexity helped early farmers select varieties suitable as 
domesticated crops. Wild grains tend to ripen unevenly and "shatter", 
meaning they drop seeds from the head as they ripen. Domesticated 
versions need to have larger seeds and the heads must hold together 
until all the seeds are all ripe so they can be harvested efficiently. 
The modern Common Wheat and Durum Wheat are also "free threshing", 
meaning they come out of their husks with little effort.</p>
<p>Information on storage life and storage methods for all these grains 
in their various forms can be found on our page <a href="gr_store.html">

<h2 id="type" class=lrg>Types of Wheat</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Common Wheat:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whwhole01e.jpg" alt="Whole Bread Wheat grains" class=mrg>
[Bread Wheat, <i>Triticum aestivum</i>]
<p>
This is the wheat most grown today, a free threshing wheat with greater 
cold hardiness than most wheats. It developed naturally in farmer's 
fields, was selected out and is now cultivated in temperate regions 
worldwide. Like spelt, to which it is closely related, it is hybridized 
with Goat Grass (<i>Aegilops cylindrica</i> alt <i>Aegilops 
tauschii</i>). Several varieties have been selected as major crops in 
North America.<br class=cll></p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Hard Red Spring Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; [strong wheat (GB)] Used to 
    make high protein (high gluten) flour for bread and other firm baked 
    goods that need a lot of elasticity for good rising.</li>
  <li><h3>Hard Red Winter Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; Another high protein bread 
    wheat. It is often blended with lower gluten wheats to produce All 
    Purpose flour.</li>
  <li><h3>Soft Red Winter Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; A low protein wheat used to make 
    pastry flour suitable for cakes, pie crusts, muffins and other baked 
    goods where tenderness is a prime concern.</li>
  <li><h3>Hard White Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; A medium protein wheat used for bread 
    and brewing.</li>
  <li><h3>Soft White Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; A low protein wheat used to make 
    pastry flour suitable for cakes, pie crusts, pastries and the like where 
    tenderness is a prime concern.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Durum Wheat:</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_durum02k.jpg" alt="Ripe Durum Wheat" class=mrg> 
[Pasta Wheat, Semolina, <i>Triticum durum</i>]
<p>
This is a very hard, high protein (but moderate gluten) wheat 
particularly used for making pasta. This wheat was developed by 
artificial selection from domesticated Emmer Wheat. It's origin is 
thought to be Egypt or Ethiopia, and it spread through the Magreb and 
Middle East. It was brought to Europe by the Islamic invasions of Spain, 
Southeast Europe and Sicily.</p>
<p>This wheat is used for all high quality dried pasta, including the 
couscous of North Africa and the Levant. The moderate gluten level 
makes possible extruding it into various shapes. It is also used in Italy 
to make pizza bread and in North Africa to make flat breads, but the 
biggest use is to make bulgur (parboiled wheat). The Middle East and 
North Africa are the largest producers, followed by North America and 
Western Europe.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="spelt">Spelt:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_spelt01h.jpg" alt="Whole Spelt Grains" class=mrg>
[<i>Triticum spelta</i>]
<p>
This grain is a hybrid of 
a domesticated  Emmer (<i>Triticum dicoccum</i>) and Goat Grass 
(<i>Aegilops cylindrica</i> alt <i>Aegilops tauschii</i>), a common 
weed in wheat fields. This probably happened in Anatolia and the Caucasus 
where goat grass is native and the earliest evidence is found (around 
4000 BCE). It may have happened again in central Europe around 2000 BCE, 
but as a hybrid of emmer and common wheat.<p>
<p>Spelt is mentioned in translations of Jewish, Greek and Latin texts, 
but it did not grow in those regions and the translation should have been 
to Emmer.</p>
<p>Spelt was an important crop in Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval 
times and was introduced into North America but has been almost totally 
displaced by Common Wheat. It has recently found new markets. One is for 
use by people with a wheat allergy (but it's not suitable for celiacs). 
It has the most desirable qualities for the "health food" market, being 
exotic and expensive. It has also been adopted by the organic farming 
movement because it requires less fertilizers than regular wheat. It has 
hard husks so it's much more difficult to thresh than common or durum 
wheats.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="adjar">Adjar:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_adjar01h.jpg" alt="Whole Adjar Grains" class=mrg>
[&#1369;&#1329;&#1347;&#1329;&#1360; or &#1369;&#1329;&#1395;&#1377;&#1408;, 
Adjar (Armenia); Zanduri (Georgia); Parinj (Iran); 
<i>Triticum timopheevii</i> | wild <i>Triticum araraticum</i>]
<p>
The wild version of this grain grows all through the Southern Caucasus 
and from southeastern Turkey through northern Iraq to northwest Iran. 
The domesticated form is grown mostly in Georgia. It is used in Georgia, 
Armenia and parts of Iran to make pilafs, for which it is highly regarded, 
and is also ground into flour to make bread. Adjar is pretty easy to find 
in the ethnic markets here in Los Angeles, particularly around Glendale 
(the Western capital of Armenia), but may be hard to find in other 
regions. The best substitute is probably <a href="gr_wheat.html#spelt">
<b>Spelt</b></a>, though not exact.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="farro">Emmer / Farro:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_emmer03h.jpg" alt="Pearled Effer Grains" class=mrg>
[Farro (Italy); <i>Triticum dicoccum</i>]
<p>
This grain was first domesticated in the southeastern region of Anatolia 
about 9500 BCE. Wild emmer was presumed extinct, but a remanent 
population was found in Israel in 1906. Emmer was a widely grown crop 
throughout the Near East and North Africa. Emmer and Barley were the 
main ingredients in bread and beer in ancient Egypt. The photo specimens 
were "pearled" Farro from Italy. In other words, the fibrous outer layer 
has been milled off.</p>
<p>Today Emmer is grown mainly in mountainous areas of southern Europe 
and North Africa where it gives better yield in poor soil than other 
wheat crops and has better disease resistance. Emmer, as Farro, is most 
popular in Italy and grown as a certified crop in Tuscany. It is widely 
sold in Europe as a "health food" because it is sufficiently expensive 
for that market, but due to demand, spelt is being grown in 
non-certified regions and deceptively sold as Farro.</p>
<p>Emmer is baked into bread in Italy and Switzerland and in Tuscany is 
used as whole grains in soup. Today it is being made into pasta for the 
"health food" market, but many consider the texture of emmer pasta 
inferior. Emmer has a higher fiber content than regular wheat. It has 
hard husks so is much more difficult to thresh than common or durum 
wheats.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Einkorn:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_einkorn01c.jpg" alt="Einkorn Seed Head" class=mrg>
[<i>Triticum monococcum</i>]
<p>
This grain was first domesticated in southeastern Anatolia around 7000 
BCE. It differs from the wild variety (<i>Triticum boeoticum</i>) in 
that the seeds are larger and the heads do not "shatter". It was already 
in decline by the Bronze Age and today is planted only in mountainous 
regions around the Mediterranean basin where it survives well in poor 
soil. It is often made into bulgur (parboiled and cracked wheat) in 
those regions. It has hard husks so is much more difficult to thresh 
than common or durum wheats.

</p><p>
A relatively low yield wheat producing very large kernels, probably 
originating in northern Mesopotamia (stories of it coming from an 
Egyptian tomb are highly unlikely). It is a "heritage" variety some of 
which has been grown in Egypt but is mostly found in small plots in 
southeastern Turkey. Some people with a wheat allergy can eat this grain, 
but not celiacs. KAMUT is a registered trademark designed to control 
the characteristics of the type and is not a generic term for this type 
of grain.

<img src="img/gr_wheatkern01.jpg" alt="Kernel structure" class=mrg>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li><h3>Husk:</h3> &nbsp; [glumes] This is the shell around the wheat 
  kernel. On Common and Durum wheat it is loose, fragile and easily 
  removed, and never part of the product. Other forms of wheat have hard 
  husks more difficult to remove.  These are often stored husk-on to 
  avoid damage, with the husk removed just before shipping.</li>
<li><h3>Bran:</h3> &nbsp; This is a thin multi-layer fibrous coating on 
  the outside of the grain, and includes more vitamins and minerals than 
  the inside of the seed. Because it increases cooking time and colors 
  the end product it is often removed. Some techniques, particularly 
  pearling, can leave the nutritious inner aleurone layer largely intact.
  </li>
<li><h3>Germ:</h3> &nbsp; This is the actual living part, the new wheat 
  plant. It is very nutritious, including protein, vitamins, oils and 
  antioxidants. Unfortunately it also goes rancid rather quickly, which 
  is why whole wheat flour can't be stored for long. Wheat germ is a 
  valuable side product and is removed from wheat destined to be white 
  or unbleached flour and sold separately.</li>
<li><h3>Endosperm:</h3> &nbsp; This is the bulk of the seed and is 
  composed mostly of starch and protein (gluten). It is not high in 
  vitamins or  minerals, but its keeping properties are good, depending 
  on how thoroughly the germ has been removed. &nbsp; <small>Drawing by

<h2 id="prod" class=lrg>Wheat Products</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Whole Wheat:</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_whwhole01e.jpg" alt="Whole Wheat grains" class=mrg>
[Wheat Berries (popular)]
<p>
This is the whole wheat kernel with only the husk removed. It has very 
good storage properties (25 years and more) so long as it is not damaged, 
but vitamins will be depleted in 3 years and gone in 5. This form has 
the greatest amount of nutrients but it takes a very long time to cook 
and it has a distinctive nutty flavor. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pearled Wheat:</h2>
<br>This is wheat with the outer bran layer removed by an abrasive 
process. It is increasingly used to prepare wheat for roller milling 
into flour rather than removal by the first roller stage which is not 
as precisely controllable. It is not generally sold as a retail product 
(see Pelted Wheat).<p></p>

<h2>Pelted Wheat:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whpelt05e.jpg" alt="Grains" class=mrg>
[Dzedzadz (Armenia); Jareesh, Jerrish, Gerish, Gerrish, (Arabic - 
crushed); Ceris (Turk); Hurled Wheat]
<p>
This is used particularly in Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and Persian 
cuisines, so is quite available here in Los Angeles. The whole wheat 
grains have been lightly pearled (the outer bran layer removed by 
abrasion) and polished. The germ is still present but has been damaged 
to the point it is not viable. It cooks more quickly than whole wheat 
and has a less assertive flavor. Some of the fiber has been removed and 
its keeping properties are less than for whole grain because the germ 
will be slightly damaged. This product is also available crushed under 
various spelling of "Jareesh", used particularly in the Arabian 
peninsula in a dish called "Jareesh".
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cracked Wheat:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whcrkp01e.jpg" alt="Crushed grains" class=mrg>
[Gorgot, Gorgod (Armenia); Yarma (Turkey); Daliya (India)]
<p>
Whole wheat or pelted wheat kernels crushed (I have also found packages 
of whole pelted wheat labeled Gorgot). This product will cook much 
faster than whole wheat, but it is much more perishable due to damage to 
the wheat germ. Keeping properties will be similar to Bulgur. It is not 
equivalent to Bulgur, though they are often confused - Cracked Wheat takes 
a lot longer to cook. It is sold in fine, medium and coarse grades. The 
photo specimen of very coarsely crushed pelted wheat and was labeled 
"Yarma".
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Bulgur:</h2>
<br><a href="gr_bulgz.html">
<img src="img/gr_bulgsz01h.jpg" alt="#1, #2, #3, #4" class=mrg></a>
[Bulghur, Burghul, Arisah]
<p> 
Whole wheat kernels are soaked, then boiled or steamed and dried. 
When dry, the hulls and some of the bran are removed (as little as 5%) after 
which they are crushed and sorted to various mesh sizes. This form cooks much 
faster than cracked wheat and can be used uncooked (just soak well). As with 
parboiled rice, some of the bran nutrients are driven deeper into the berry 
for better nutrition. Bulgur is much used in the cuisines of southeastern 
Europe, Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, 
ancient Rome and the Levant, Bulgur is sold in numbered grades depending on 
coarseness. The photo shows #1 and #2 on the top row and #3 and #4 on 
the bottom. Grade #5 is not easy to find.
&nbsp; <a href="gr_bulgz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
  <li>#1 - fine - often mixed with ground lamb to make kibbe.</li>
  <li>#2 - medium - used for tabouli</li>
  <li>#3 - coarse - used for pilafs, casseroles, baked dishes.</li>
  <li>#4 - half cut - used for pilafs - not as common as finer grades.</li>
  <li>#5 - very coarsely crushed - almost whole grain.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Freekeh</h2>
<br><a href="gr_freekz.html">
<img src="img/gr_whfeek01e.jpg" alt="Hulled grain" class=mrg></a>
[Farik; Firik (Turk); Triticum turgidum var. durum]
<p>
Green (unripe) wheat that has been fire roasted and cracked, it's quite 
a bit more expensive than Bulgur. This form is used mainly in the Levant, 
Egypt, and across North Africa, but is now widely available in Turkey 
due to influx of Syrian refugees. It has also recently been discovered 
by North American health food enthusiasts. The samples we have used were 
exported from Syria and Jordan.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Wheat Flakes</h2>
<br>Wheat is soaked and steamed, then flattened 
between rollers to make flakes. These can be used to make a hot breakfast 
cereal similar to rolled oats. The flakes can be further processed to make 
them usable as cold breakfast cereals, for example, Wheaties<small>&reg;
</small>.<p></p>

<h2>Wheat Bran:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whtbran01h.jpg" alt="Small pile of Wheat Bran" class=mrg>
This is the outer layer of the wheat kernel, removed before milling 
into white flour. It is used mainly to add dietary fiber to products 
deficient in fiber or to make a "high fiber" claim on the box. It 
contains minerals and, if fresh, vitamins.

<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Wheat Germ:</h2>
<br>This is the living part of the wheat kernel. Because it is highly 
perishable it is removed from the grain in making white flour. Because 
it is high in vitamins and oils it is in high demand, and the salvaged 
germ can often be sold for more than the flour.<p></p>

<h2>Wheat Germ Oil:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whtgrmoil01n.jpg" alt="Vial of Wheat Germ Oil" class=mrg>
<p>This oil contains the highest concentration of vitamin E of any plant 
source. It also contains long string fatty alcohols, suspected of being 
able to lower blood cholesterol, and other substances of nutritional 
interest. It is not used as a cooking oil because of its strong taste 
and high price.

<h2 id="flour" class=lrg>Wheat Flours:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The largest portion of the wheat crop is ground very fine into flour 
for making bread and a vast number of other applications. See our page 
<a href="gr_store.html"><b>Grain, Seed &amp; Flour Storage</b></a> for 
storage methods and recommended storage times.</p>
 <ul>
  <li><h3>Whole Wheat Flour</h3> [Whole Meal Flour (UK)] &nbsp; Wheat 
    ground to flour without removing the germ or bran coating, it can be 
    made from any kind of wheat but is usually an "all purpose" flour or 
    "bread flour". It contains more nutrients than white flour but it has 
    to be used quickly because the oils in the wheat germ turn rancid and 
    bitter in about 3 months.  For better rising breads it is often 
    mixed with White Flour.</li>
  <li><h3>Graham Flour</h3> &nbsp; A courser grind of Whole Wheat flour, 
    promoted by Sylvester Graham in the 1830s and used to make Graham 
    Crackers and pie crusts.</li>
  <li><h3>White Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Flour ground from wheat that has 
    been milled to remove the bran coating and germ. It is commonly 
    bleached to improve  whiteness. Because most of the germ oils have 
    been removed (along with vitamin E and other nutrients) it does not 
    go rancid as quickly as Whole Wheat flour.</li>
  <li><h3>All-Purpose Flour:</h3> &nbsp; [Plain Flour (UK)]  &nbsp;  A 
    medium gluten flour that can be used for most purposes but is ideal 
    for few. Bleached and  unbleached versions are available. Bleached 
    has less protein and should be used for cookies, quick breads, pie 
    crusts, pancakes and waffles. Unbleached is better for yeast breads, 
    puff pastry, strudel, Danish pastries, &eacute;clairs, cream puffs, 
    popovers and Yorkshire pudding.</li>
  <li><h3>Bread Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Made from hard wheat with high gluten 
    content (or a softer wheat fortified with Gluten Flour), this flour 
    is generally unbleached and sometimes treated with ascorbic acid 
    (vitamin C). It produces elastic dough that rises well with strong 
    bubble walls and is the best flour for all yeast rising products.
    </li>
  <li><h3>Pastry Flour</h3> &nbsp;  Made from soft wheat but with more 
    gluten than Cake Flour, this flour is used for biscuits, pie crusts, 
    cookies, quick breads and pastries. It is unsuitable for yeast 
    rising products.</li>
  <li><h3>Cake Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This flour is made from the softest 
    low gluten grades of wheat. It is ground very fine and generally 
    bleached by a method that leaves it slightly acid for better rising. 
    This flour will make very light, tender products even if they contain 
    a lot of sugar. If you have to use all-purpose flour instead, 
    subtract 2 T per cup of cake flour called for in the recipe.</li>
  <li><h3>Gluten Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Pure wheat gluten with all other 
    components removed. Used mainly as an additive to increase gluten 
    in other flours.</li>
  <li><h3>Self Rising Flour:</h3> &nbsp; [Pancake Flour] &nbsp; an "all 
    purpose" flour with baking powder and  salt added (typically 1 cup 
    flour, 1-1/2 t baking powder + 1/2 t salt). It is used for biscuits, 
    pancakes and the like.</li>
  <li><h3>Instant Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This product is a granular formula 
    designed to dissolve quickly in hot or cold liquids. It is used mainly 
    for making sauces.</li>
  <li><h3>Farina:</h3> &nbsp; A fine ground wheat but coarser than flour. 
    It is made from soft wheat but is commonly unbleached, though brand 
    name versions like Cream of Wheat are bleached.</li>
  <li><h3>Durum Semolina:</h3> &nbsp; Hard Durum wheat ground a little 
    coarser than regular flour. Its most important use is to make high 
    quality pasta, but it is also used to make puddings and in many other 
    ways. It is used to make bread in some parts of Italy and North 
    Africa, but it has less gluten than hard bread flour.</li> 
  <li><h3>Semolina Meal:</h3> &nbsp;  Hard Durum wheat ground a little 
    coarser than Semolina Flour. It is often used to make cooked cereals 
    like farina.</li>
  <li><h3>Spelt Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Often used by people with a wheat 
    allergy (but not celiacs), this flour comes in Whole Wheat and White 
    varieties. It doesn't rise as well as wheat flour so it's not easy 
    to make it into a light yeast rising bread. It is more soluble in 
    water than wheat flour so when substituting for wheat use about 3/4 
    the amount of water. Its gluten is fragile so it can't take a lot of 
    kneading.</li>
  <li><h3>Teff Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This is not a Wheat flour. Wheat and 
    its close relatives are in subfamily <i>Pooideae</i>, while Teff 
    is in the more drought resistant subfamily <i>Chloridoideae</i>. 
    This flour is needed to make the authentic <i>injera</i> sourdough 
    flatbread used in Ethiopia (traditionally made so large it's used 
    as an edible tablecloth). It is always whole grain and varies in 
    color and flavor. Currently, in North America, it can be found in 
    some health food stores, on-line, and in Ethiopian markets. For 
    details see our <a href="gr_teffz.html"><b>Teff</b></a> page.

<h3>Disclaimer:</h3> &nbsp; I am not a medical or diet practitioner 
of any kind, and don't claim to be one at parties or even on dates. 
What is written here is informational, gleaned from publicly available 
material, and can not be considered medical advice. On the other hand, 
I have no financial incentive to bias my take on the subject.<p></p>

<h3>Protein:</h3> &nbsp; Wheat is high in protein, but its protein 
profile, like the protein profile of other grains, is incomplete for 
human nutrition. Vegetarians must complimented grains with beans, which 
are protein deficient in the opposite direction. Persons with a diet rich 
in meats are getting an excess of protein, so this deficiency is 
irrelevant to them.

<p>Typically, for 100 grams of hard red winter wheat, 12.6 grams is 
protein, 1.5 grams is fat, 71 grams is carbohydrates (mostly starch) and 
12.2 grams is dietary fiber. Wheat is fairly high in iron, around 3.5 
milligrams per 100 grams depending on variety.</p>

<h3>Gluten Intolerance:</h3> &nbsp;  Roughly 1 in 133 people of 
Indo-European descent have an intolerance to gluten, a protein in wheat, 
barley, rye and some other grass seeds. This is an autoimmune 
disorder of the small intestine and is of genetic origin. Called 
"celiac disease" in North America and "coeliac disease" in Europe and 
elsewhere, it is currently under-diagnosed in North America and often 
misdiagnosed as "irritable bowel syndrome". It is a debilitating and 
degenerative condition which must be taken seriously.

<p>There is no cure for Gluten Intolerance. A person with this condition 
must follow a strictly gluten-free diet, including avoidance of all 
products with even traces of wheat, barley, rye and other gluten bearing 
grains. Rice and Corn are gluten free grains that can be used as 
alternatives.</p>

<h3>Gluten Sensitivity:</h3> &nbsp; Some people are sensitive to gluten, 
suffering similar digestive problems, but come up negative for celiac 
disease and have no evidence of digestive tract degradation. This 
condition is poorly understood and people vary greatly in sensitivity. 
There is currently no reliable diagnostic.

<p>Persons who suffer from these digestive problems are recommended to 
try a gluten free diet for a few weeks. If they improve markedly they 
should consider a gluten free diet.</p>

<h3>Allergies:</h3> &nbsp; Some people who are not celiacs are allergic 
to wheat proteins and must avoid wheat and other gluten containing 
grains. This condition is discomforting, but not as dangerous as 
celiac disease.<p></p>

<h3>Gluten Free Diet:</h3> &nbsp; a "celiac clean" diet takes a great 
deal of attention to every bit of food eaten, and close attention to 
intake of vitamins and minerals, fiber and other nutrients which can 
easily be deficient in such a diet.
 
<p>Many health industry practitioners are now strongly promoting a 
gluten free diet for everyone (and many of them are selling products 
related to that). Actual nutritional scientists generally recommend 
not going on such a diet if there is not a clear reason to do so, 
because it makes proper nutrition more difficult and more 
expensive.</p>

<p>There is a current fad to go "gluten free" for rapid weight loss. 
Experts say this is hokum, the only way such a diet will cause weight 
loss is if your diet is now so unappetizing you don't want to eat. 
Hardly a good trade off. Many gluten free products are more fattening 
than their gluten containing equivalents, and poorer in vitamins and 
minerals.</p>
