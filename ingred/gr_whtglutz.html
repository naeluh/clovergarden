<p>
Wheat gluten is made by washing the starch out of bread flour 
("strong flour" in England). This can be done at home, but various gluten 
products are sold canned in Asian markets, including mock duck with 
a duck skin texture, mock abalone and mock scallops. Most of these products 
are fried before canning.and need to be washed in several changes of hot 
water to remove the oil taste.</p>
<p>The Gluten Cakes shown in the photo were about 6 inches long by 0.88 
inch, diameter and weighted 8 ounces average. 2020 US $0.99 each. The 
Gluten Rolls in the photo were about 6 inches long by 1.33 inch diameter 
and weighed 3.3 ounces average, 2020 US $0.59 each. Both were purchased 
out of tubs of water from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel). I have also seen rolls packaged in plastic bags sold 
in the refrigerated section near the tofu. The twisted roll has more 
texture and fries faster than the sausage, but both are suitable for 
most recipes. These products are fully cooked by steaming or boiling.</p> 

<p>Wheat gluten is used in vegetarian cuisines as a replacement for meat.
Does it taste like meat? Well, not really. Does it have the texture of 
meat? Not really, but it's as close as you're going to get. On the other 
hand, it's a very worthy product despite its failure to be meat. Some 
vegetarian purists with vivid imaginations won't eat it because it's 
"too meat like", but it's been truly said, "A purest will say anything 
to make life more difficult".</p>

<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; <a href="../diet/celiac.html"><b>Celiac 
Disease</b></a>, a genetic auto-immune intolerance to gluten, now 
affects almst 1% of North Americans. Reactions to gluten, mild or 
severe, should be watched for. Most sufferers are northern Europeans, 
but Hispanics, Blacks and Asians may also suffer this disorder.

<h2>Cooking</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_whtglut04e.jpg" alt="Fried Slices of Gluten" class=mrg>
Gluten is most often deep fried, and will achieve its most meat-like 
consistency that way, it may also be boiled or steamed.
The photo to the left shows gluten rolls and cakes sliced and deep 
fried. Both twisted sheet and sausage forms are included. They should be 
fried in oil at around 350&deg;F/175&deg;C in small batches. They foam 
a lot when lowered in but do not splash or splatter, so frying them in 
a wok or kadhai will not make a mess. Tumble them now and then for even 
frying. They are done when they have good color and have been floating 
at the surface for a minute or so. Remove from the oil with a wire 
spider and drain on paper towels. 12 ounces of gluten rolls will yield 
about 7-1/2 ounces after frying (63%). If cooking time will be short, 
brown them only lightly or they will be very stiff and chewy. They 
need to be simmered in a sauce for a bit for edibility.

<p>This is a common product in East Asian markets here in Los Angeles. It 
is used in many Chinese recipes, particularly vegetable stews and stir 
fries. The photo specimen, in a 6 ounce can (drained weight 4 ounces), 
packed in a soy sauce flavored broth, was purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2020 US $1.29 / can. Ingred: 
Water, Fried Gluten (18%)(Wheat flour, Soybean Oil), Soy Sauce (8%) 
(Water, Soybean, Wheat, Salt), Sugar, Salt.

<h2>Seitan:</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_whtseit03e.jpg" alt="Fried Seitan Puffs" class=mrg>
This is just Wheat Gluten like any other. It was introduced to North 
Americans by the Michio Kushi Macrobiotics movement under the name 
"seitan". This name is said to have been made up by movement founder 
George Ohsawa, and originally used in Japan. From there it spread to 
the general vegetarian communities and is used to make various meat 
substitutes, including Tofurkey.
<p>The photo shows deep fried SeitanPuffs - the same thing as the canned 
ones above, but much larger and with no sauce. They were about 2-1/2 
inches across and weighed nearly an ounce each. They were tough and 
chewey, needing a simmer in some kind of sauce to be really edible. 
Ingred: water, vital wheat gluten, canola oil, baking powder.</p>
<p>Seitan is often sold by outlets serving Macrobiotics and vegetarian 
communities, usually in block form. It is also sold in powdered form, 
called "Vital Wheat Gluten" to be reconstituted with water. This form 
saves the trouble of washing the starch out by hand when you need 
fresh wheat gluten. &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; Inhaling the powder 
presents risk of gumming up the lungs - wear a face mask when handling.

<h2>Making Wheat Gluten:</h2> &nbsp; To make your own Gluten Puffs, or 
unusual shapes, you need to start by making raw gluten. Today, most 
North American vegetarians making wheat gluten start with commercially 
extracted gluten flour, often called "vital wheat gluten". The 
traditional method uses strong bread flour and is just like bread making. 
It requires a fair amount of kneading, resting and kneading again to 
develop the gluten. The dough ball is then wrung out in several changes 
of water until all the starch is washed out. After that it's shaped 
into pieces, placed in cold water or broth, and slowly brought to a 
simmer, or it can be deep fried into puffs. A detailed procedure can 
be found at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Seitan">
