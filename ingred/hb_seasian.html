   <h2>Spearmint</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mt_mintsp10h.jpg" alt="Growing Spearmint Plant" class=mrg>
   [Spear Mint; Rau Hung (Viet); <i>Mentha spicata</i> alt <i>Mentha 
   cordifolia</i>]
   <p>
   This mint, the most widely available in North America, originated in 
   Europe or Southwest Asia, but is now grown worldwide. It works fine in 
   Southeast Asian recipes that call for "Mint Leaves" without other 
   qualifiers.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Vietnamese Mint / Scotch Spearmint</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mt_mtviet02h.jpg" alt="Vase of Vietnamese Mint" class=mrg>
   <p>[Rau Hung Cay (Viet); Gingermint; Scotchmint (UK);<i>Mentha x 
   gracilis</i>]
   </p><p>
   This mint is a naturally occurring sterile hybrid of Spearmint and 
   Field Mint (<i>M. arvensis</i>). It is used in Vietnam for herb plates 
   and in Pho. The leaves are thinner and more delicate than Spearmint, 
   and it has a bit of Peppermint bite. The leaves are typically up to 
   2-3/4 inches long.</p>
   <p>The world center for growing this mint is the U.S. Pacific 
   Northwest, Wisconsin and Idaho, with smaller production in Alberta 
   and Saskatchewan, Canada. The North American production is used almost 
   entirely for processing into mint flavors for chewing gum, candies, 
   and as a rat repellant. The photo specimens were purchased from a 
   large Chinese / Vietnamese market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
   2016 US $1.09 for 2-1/2 ounces.

   <h2 class=lrg>Thai Basils</h2>
   <br>These basils have become quite important in some parts of North 
   America, particularly Southern California, where there are large Thai 
   and Vietnamese communities, as well as a general enthusiasm for Thai 
   cuisine.<p></p>

      [Bai Horapha (Thai); Hung Que (Viet); Anise Basil; <i>Ocimum 
      basilicum</i> var <i>thyrsiflora</i>]
      <p>
      Now quite common in Southern California, this basil has good flavor 
      and reasonable keeping properties (almost a week if very fresh and 
      treated carefully). 
      In general the leaves are dark green with only a hint of purple, 
      and the stems are distinctly purple, but there are also all-green 
      varieties. Of the Asian basils, this one is closest to Italian Basil 
      but is sharper, slightly sweeter, and with a more anise-like flavor. 
      They can substitute for each other in a pinch. I've even used Thai 
      Purple Basil to make Italian Pesto because I can get piles of it 
      cheap at ethnic markets, while Italian Basil can cost several 
      dollars an ounce in the supermarkets.

      [Bai Maeng-lak (Thai); <i>O. citriodorum</i>]
      <p>
      This is one of the basils that has become common in Southern California, 
      often labeled "Thai Basil". It is characterized by a citrus fragrance, 
      smaller light green pointed leaves and a relatively light flavor - 
      and bad keeping properties (maybe 3 days if you take good care of it). 
      It often alternates with Thai Purple Basil in the markets. The 
      stronger more aromatic flavor of the purple is better for most Thai 
      cooking while the Lemon Basil is used mainly for salads and 
      some soups.

      [Tulsi (india); Krapao (Thai); Humong Basil (Calif.); Hot Basil; 
      <i>Ocimum sanctum</i>  (Mint family)]
      <p>In India this basil is highly revered and used for religious 
      purposes and in Ayurvedic medicine. In Thailand and Vietnam it is 
      used as a culinary herb. Unlike other basils it is always cooked, not 
      used raw or just warmed. There are two basic varieties, one with 
      purplish green leaves and purple stems (called purple), the other is 
      all green (called white). Unlike other basils the leaf margins are 
      strongly serrated, the leaves are slightly fuzzy and the stems are 
      definitely fuzzy. It has very poor keeping qualities, if it's really 
      fresh when you buy it you may get 2 days. Holy Basil has a strong 
      flavor that is sharper and more minty than other basils, and with a 
      hint of camphor.

   <img src="img/mt_tia-to03h.jpg" alt="Tia-to Leaves" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Perilla frutescens</i>]
   <p>
   The Vietnamese variety of perilla is considerably smaller than 
   the Korean or Japanese, and more aromatic. It is used in soups and 
   stews, and particularly with rice vermicelli dishes called 
   <i>b&uacute;n</i>. In Laos they are used in a similar dish called 
   <i>kao phoon</i>.</p>
   <p>These leaves are often available in some of the large Asian markets 
   here in Los Angeles.

   [Vietnamese Lemon Mint, Cockscomb Mint;  Rau Kinh Gioi, L&aacute; 
   Kinh Gioi; <i>Elsholtzia ciliata</i>]
   <p>
   Pronounced "Kin Zoy", the leaves of this plant are thin and delicate 
   with the taste of a lemony combination of mint and Thai basil. The 
   plant bears flat spikes of light lavender colored flowers. Leaves are  
   generally eaten raw, included on an herb plate that may accompany 
   cooked foods such as grilled meats. The raw leaves may also be stirred 
   into soups, such a Pho, included in egg rolls, meat balls and the 
   like. Here in Southern California these leaves are often available in 
   the big Asian markets along Valley Blvd in Los Angeles (Alhambra, 
   San Gabriel), and in Little Saigon down in Orange County.

   <h2>Ngo Om</h2>
   <br><a href="lm_ngoomz.html">

   Phak Kayang (Thailand); Tian Xiang Cao, Zi Su Cao (China); Soyop-pul 
   (Korea); Shiso-kusa (Japan); <i>Limnophila aromatica</i>]
   <p>
   This aquatic herb, a member of the Plantain family, is native throughout 
   Southeast Asia, extending into southern China, Japan and Australia. After 
   the Vietnam war, it was brought to North America by refugees, and is now 
   easily available in the Asian markets here in Southern California. This 
   plant grows well in still water, such as found in rice paddies. It's 
   particularly popular in Vietnam, but is also used in China and Japan. 
   In Chinese, Japanese and Korean, the name of this herb is the same as for 
   <a href="mt_perilz.html">Perilla</a>, a very distantly related herb. It 
   is made specific with a suffix meaning green leafy plant (see names 
   above).

   <i>Jasminum subtriplinerve</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South and Southeast Asia, <i>J. sambac</i> is the variety 
   used in China to make jasmine tea. The white flowers are dried and 
   mixed with green or black tea. The flowers, which have a very strong 
   perfume, open at night and close in the morning.</p>
   <p>The leaves of <i>J. subtriplinerve</i> (photo), are used to make 
   a medicinal tea in Vietnam, said to be anti-bacterial and to 
   stimulate mammary glands to increase lactation.

   <h2>Rau Dang Bien</h2>
   <br><img src="img/cn_raudang02e.jpg" alt="Rau Dang Bien Leaves and Flowers" class=mrg>
   [Bitter Leaf, Bitter Herb, Bitter Cumin; Rau Dang (Viet); Jima, Jharasi, 
   Peru-n-tiray (India); <i>Glinus oppositifolius</i> of family 
   <i>Molluginaceae</i>]
   <p>
   There is confusion due to more than one Rau Dang (Bitter Leaf), but all 
   the Vietnamese sources I've found with photos of culinary usage show 
   this one, and it's the one available in Asian markets here in Los 
   Angeles. It is a tropical and subtropical plant that grows in very wet 
   areas of Africa, South and Southeast Asia and Australia. With rather mild 
   bitterness, it is an important flavoring for some Vietnamese soups. It 
   is also eaten as a vegetable in parts of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
   <p>This plant is now grown in Southern California (approval was probably 
   delayed by the State's intense suspicion of fast growing water plants 
   that clog irrigation channels). The name "Bitter Cumin" comes from the 
   cumin shaped seeds. A related species, <i>Glinus lotoides</i>, with 
   similar distribution, is similarly used.

   <h2>Rau Dang</h2>

   [Bitter Leaf, Bitter Herb, Prostrate Knotweed, Birdweed, Pigweed; 
   Rau Dang (Viet (Bitter Leaf)); <i>Polygonum aviculare</i> of family 
   <i>Polygonaceae</i>]
   <p>
   This plant may or may not have culinary usage in Vietnam (see Rau Dang 
   above), but that it is called Rau Dang (Bitter Leaf) is confirmed by the 
   Viet version of Wikipedia. In any case, it is sour in taste from oxalic 
   acid, and it does have medicinal uses. This plant is a common weed in 
   California and many other places worldwide.

   tomhom, Chi pong tea koun (Cambodia); Phak-pai (NE India); 
   <i>Persicaria odorata</i> syn <i>Polygonum odoratum</i> of family 
   <i>Polygonaceae</i>]
   <p>
   This rangy herb is used throughout Southeast Asia, raw in salads and 
   summer rolls, as a garnish and cooked, particularly in soups, but also 
   in some stews. It has a slightly resinous taste and is particularly 
   associated with Vietnamese cuisine. It is considered a suppressant of 
   sexual urges so is often grown by Buddhist monks to make celibacy more 
   tolerable. This herb is easily recognized from the spearhead shaped 
   leaves with two purplish splotches.

   <i>Rumex acetosa</i>]
   <p>
   Sorrel grows wild over much of Europe and is a common crop there, but 
   is little known in Vietnam, where there is no Vietnamese name for it. 
   It has, however, been added to the raw herb plate by Viet-Americans 
   under the names Rau chua (sour herb) or Rau thom (fresh herb). As 
   with spinach, sorrel's tartness is provided by oxalic acid.

<h2>Kaffir Lime</h2>

   [Makrut (Thai), Krauch Soeuch (Cambodia), Limau Purut (Malay), 
   <i>Citrus hystrix</i>]
   <p>
   Not really a lime, this citrus fruit is native to Southeast Asia and 
   used particularly in Thai Cuisine. The odd double leaves are most used, 
   often in soups, but also in salads and stir fries. The rind of the 
   fruit is used in Thai curry pastes. Many references say the juice is 
   inedible but I do not find that the case, though there isn't a lot 
   of juice in a kaffir lime.</p>
   <p>For soups, the leaves are used whole, but for salads and the like 
   they are rolled up tightly, then cut into threads from both sides of 
   the main rib. The threads may then be chopped, and can be pounded in 
   a mortar if they need to be softened, as they do not soften in 
   cooking. The substitute is lime zest, just the green, no white. 
   The shrub makes a very nice and useful decorative which can be 
   grown in a container, so many nurseries stock them. When fully ripe, 
   the fruit turns just a touch yellowish and falls from the tree but 
   it is generally used before that stage. The trees need to be pruned 
   to keep them leafy.

   relatively thin stems, is stronger in flavor and is more fibrous than 
   Pascal celery. It is now grown in California and available in the many 
   Asian markets here. If your recipe calls for it and you can't get it, 
   buy the leafiest head of regular celery you can find, and use the part 
   above the first joint where the flavor is stronger. The specimens

   In North America, Cilantro is now available in just about every

   than a cubic yard of it on a typical Saturday. There is a strong 
   "I hate Cilantro" movement on the Internet, but the condition has 
   proved curable by exposure.</p>
   <p>The roots are also edible, used mainly in the cuisine of Thailand, 
   and to a lesser extent in some of its neighbors. They are used as a

   Asia, Sri Lanka and Australia. Botanists variously place them in 
   family <i>Apiaceae</i> with carrots and parsley or in family 
   <i>Araliaceae</i> with ginseng or in family <i>Mackinlayaceae</i> 
   with a few Australian plants of little note. The largest photo 
   specimen (<i>H. javanica</i>) is 3-1/2 inches across the leaf.

<h2 class=lrg>Pepper Family</h2>
<br>The Pepper family (<i>Piperaceae</i>) provides various pepper 
spices, but also a number of leafy herbs important in Southeast Asia. 
For this family worldwide see our

   <p>
   This pepper, native to South and Southeast Asia, is used throughout 
   the region. In Bangladesh, the stems and roots are peeled, chopped and 
   used as a flavoring for meat dishes, particularly mutton, and tastes 
   somewhat like horseradish. In Thailand the fruits, which are orange-red 
   when ripe and black when dried, are used both fresh and dried, 
   pounded to paste or pounder and added to various curry pastes, and 
   added to fish to cut the fishy flavor. Various parts of the plant are 
   used medicinally throughout the region.

   <p>
   This pepper plant, native to Southeast Asia is very similar to 
   <a href="hb_seasian.html#lalot">Lalot</a>, and the same names are often applied in 
   Thai and Vietnamese. The leaves have a light, pleasant bitterness that 
   compliments other foods. Leaves are used as wrappers for a popular Thai 
   snack called <i>Miang kham</i>, which may be served on open leaves, a 
   do-it-yourself kit with leaves and each ingredient separate, or as 
   pre-wrapped snacks. In northern Thailand it is the main ingredient in 
   <i>Kaeng khae</i> curry. In Laos and Malaysia leaves are shredded and 
   included in salads.

   <h2>Lalot</h2>
   <br><img src="img/pi_pprleaf04e.jpg" alt="Lalot Leaves w/flower spike" class=mrg>
   [Pepper Leaf; L&aacute; L&ocirc;t, La Lop (Viet); Japloo, Jeeploo 
   (Khmer); Chaphloo (Thai); Phak ee lert, Phak nang lert (Lao); 
   <i>Piper lalot</i>]
   <p>
   The practice of wrapping meat in leaves (dolma) traveled from 
   Persia through India to Southeast Asia. They don't have grape leaves 
   in Southeast Asia, so the Vietnamese took to using lalot leaves 
   instead, wrapped around a beef sausage filling and called 
   Thit b&ograve; l&agrave; l&ocirc;t.  This leaf is also used 
   extensively as a medicinal.</p>
   <p>Lalot is often confused with the closely related 
   <a href="hb_seasian.html#chaph">"Wild Betel"</a> (<i>Piper samentosum</i>), which 
   has similar culinary uses. Both are slightly bitter and neither is 
   nearly as strongly aromatic as the related Betel Leaf. The photo 
   specimens, purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles, were up 
   to 4 x 5-1/4 inches and sold in 4 ounce bundles at 2012 US $14.99 / 
   pound.

   <h2>Betel Leaf</h2>
   <br><img src="img/pi_betel01e.jpg" alt="Green Betel Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Paan; <i>Piper betle</i>]
   <p>
   Cultivated all through India and Southeast Asia, this leaf is best 
   known as the wrapper for a slightly narcotic chew called Paan. It is 
   not the highly aromatic (and fairly bitter) leaf that has the narcotic 
   effect and negative health impact (oral cancer, etc.), but the areca 
   palm nut and tobacco around which it is wrapped. The photo specimens, 
   purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles, were 6-1/4 x 8 inches, 
   2012 US $23.99 / pound.

   <h2>Fish Mint</h2>
   <br><img src="img/pi_dapca01e.jpg" alt="Leafy Stems of Fish Mint" class=mrg>
   [Dap ca, Diep ca, Vap ca, Rap ca (Viet); Zhe'ergen, Yuxingcao (China); 
   Ja mardoh (Meghalaya India); Toningkok (Manipur India);  Masunduri 
   (Assam India); Dokudami (Japan); Lizard tail, Chameleon plant, 
   Heartleaf, Fishwort, Bishop's weed; <i>Houttuynia cordata</i> of 
   family <i>Saururaceae</i> (lizard tails)]
   <p>
   This is the only significant edible plant in order <i>Piperales</i> 
   that is not in the <i>Piper</i> genus. Fish Mint leaves are used 
   particularly in Vietnam, the far northeast of India, and in south 
   central China, often raw as a garnish or salad ingredient, but 
   sometimes cooked with other vegetables. In northeast India it is used 
   raw, but also cooked in fish curry.</p>
   <p>In south central China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, western Guangxi) 
   the long narrow rhizomes are eaten, usually raw in salads and the like. 
   They are said to have a fresh peppery flavor.</p>
   <p>Fish mint gets its name from having an unusual flavor which some 
   people consider "fishy". This herb tends to wilt badly, but can be 
   refreshed by complete immersion in cool water. The photo specimens, 
   from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, had leaves up to 2 inches 
   long and nearly 2 inches wide.</p>
   <p>Variegated varieties are cultivated as decoratives under the name 
   "Chameleon Plant". The plant is used medicinally, particularly in 
   China. It can become a difficult to eradicate invasive, and 
   is considered as such in parts of the United States and Australia.
