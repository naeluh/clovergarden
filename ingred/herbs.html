<p class=bg>Most of the culinary herbs belong to one of just a few major 
families, like Mints and Parsleys. Here we have links to pages for 
those major families. Below this section will be found those from 
minor families, or major families that include few herbs - and a few 
unusual ones you might not think to look for in the major families.
</p>

<h2>Mint Family</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [family <i>Lamiaceae</i> of order 
  <i>Lamiales</i>]
<br><a href="mt_mints.html">
<img src="img/mt_mint05h.jpg" alt="Growing Mint plant" class=mrg></a>
<p>
The Mint family is a large and diverse family of aromatic herbs, shrubs
and trees. The herbs in particular are important in culinary and medicinal 
use. It does, however, provide little in the way of fruit or vegetables. 
This family has its own <a href="mt_mints.html"><b>Mint Family</b></a> 
page detailing its members. Important members of the family include:</p>
  <table class=sub>

<p>
While the mints and basils are the Lamiales most widely used as herbs, 
there are other herbs in the order, and some plants very important for 
their fruits and seeds used as flavorings. Order

<p>
While the Dasies are a huge family (23,000 species) only a few species 
are of culinary use, but a number of these are herbs. This family has 
several pages of its own, including one for 
<a href="dy_herbs.html"><b>Daisy Family - Herbs</b></a>.

<h2>Banana Leaf</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [<i>Musa acuminata</i>, 
  <i>Musa paradisiaca</i> (plantain)]
<br><a href="bn_leafz.html">
<img src="img/bn_leaf06f.jpg" alt="1/2 Fresh Banana Leaf" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Bananas are the largest of the herbs, up to 40 feet tall. Their 
leaves are used in many tropical cultures as a flavoring wrapper for 
steamed and baked foods. The photo shows a typical half leaf (split down 
the spine) 6 feet long by 10 inches wide. Banana plants grow all over 
Southern California as tropical decoratives, but are generally not 
suitable as wrappers because the leaves have been split up by the Santa 
Ana winds.

[Bush Apple; Beletientien, Atama (Nigeria); Obeletientien, Beletete; 
<i>Heinsia crinita</i>]
<p>A shrub or small tree native to Tropical Africa. It is most use in Nigeria, 
where the leaves are considered essential for Banga Soup. The fruit is also 
eaten.

<h2>Camellia</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tea, Cha, Chai, 
  <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (Camellia family)]
<br><img src="img/hb_tea01e.jpg" alt="Growing Camellia plants" class=mrg>
<p>
This Southeast Asian camellia, source of the green, white, black and 
oolong teas of commerce, is closely related to camellias grown as 
decoratives. In fact, when European traders tried to buy tea plants in 
China, the Chinese, not realizing tea couldn't grow in Europe, substituted 
decorative camellia plants useless for tea. The Europeans, realizing they'd 
been tricked, grew the plants in controlled greenhouses and developed fancier 
decoratives, some of which were sold back to Chinese flower fanciers at 
premium prices. &nbsp; <small>Photo by

<h2>Curry Leaf</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Chalcas koenigii</i> 
  (Citrus family)]
<br><a href="ci_curryz.html">
<img src="img/ci_curryleaf10e.jpg" alt="Fresh Curry Leaf branch" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This member of the citrus family produces aromatic leaves much used in 
India, particularly southern and central India and Sri Lanka  
and essential to authenticity in those cuisines. There is no known 
substitute so if you don't have them you just have to leave them out. They 
have an aromatic and slightly camphorous taste and are generally used in 
small quantity, fried in oil with the cumin or mustard seeds before adding 
the onions or other main ingredients. 
<a href="ci_curryz.html"><b>Details &amp; Cooking</b></a>
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Epazote</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Stink Weed, Jesuit tea, 
  <i>Chenopodium ambrosioides</i> (Goosefoot family)]
<br><a href="ch_epazoz.html">
<img src="img/ch_epazota04e.jpg" alt="Growing Epazote plants" class=mrg></a>
<p>
A common weed in southern Mexico, Central and South America, Epazota is 
now grown in the warmer parts of North America and sometimes becomes an 
invasive weed here. Its main culinary use is for flavoring black beans 
and to a lesser extent other recipes from southern Mexico and Central 
America. It is reputed to prevent flatulence from eating beans and to 
relieve a number of medical conditions. An oil extracted from the seeds 
kills intestinal worms and is also an antispasmodic and abortifacient.</p>
<p>The smell of epazote is quite strong but extremely difficult to 
describe. Leading spice expert Gernot Katzer says it smells to him like 
epazote.

<h2>Fenugreek</h2>  &nbsp; -  &nbsp; [Methi (Hindi, Urdu, etc.); 
  Shanbalileh (Persia); Hilbeh (Arabic); Utakbo suneli (Georgia); 
  <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>, also <i>Trigonella cerulea</i>]
<br><a href="bp_fenugz.html">
<img src="img/bp_fenugr27h.jpg" alt="Fenugreek Springs and Seeds" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This plant, a bean related to clover, has apparently been cultivated for 
over 6000 years in the Middle East, and was also well known to the ancient 
Greeks and Egyptians. Both seeds and greens are used.</p>
 
<p>In India, fenugreek seed is toasted and included in a number of 
important <i>masalas</i> (spice mixes), and it is also used in the 
cuisines of the Middle East, Persia and Greece. The fresh green leaves 
and stems are used as an herb in these same regions, and dried 
leaves in Georgia and India.</p>
<p>Fenugreek seed is also considered an important medicinal, particularly 
for increasing lactation in nursing women. &nbsp;  
<a href="bp_fenugz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=miners>Miner's Lettuce</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Winter Purslane, 
  Spring Beauty, Indian lettuce; <i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>]
<br><img src="img/hb_minerlett01k.jpg" alt="Miner's Lettuce" class=mrg>
<p>
This herb, native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North and 
Central America, is the only member of the purslane family 
(<i>Portulacaceae</i>) other than <a href="cn_purslz.html">Common 
Purslane</a> used for food in North America and Europe. It is also now 
fairly widespread in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Named for the California Gold Rush miners who ate it to prevent scurvy, 
miner's lettuce can be used raw in salads or cooked like spinach which it 
somewhat resembles in taste. The photo shows round form of leaf with a 
flower dot at the center which will grow into a stem with a bunch of 
flowers at the tip. The normal leaves are heart or spade shaped - all 
those other leaves belong to other weeds. This herb does best in moist 
shady locations.

<h2>Ngo Om</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Ngo Om, Ba Om, Rau Om (Viet); 
  Phak Kayang (Thailand); Tian Xiang Cao, Zi Su Cao (China); Soyop-pul 
  (Korea); Shiso-kusa (Japan); <i>Limnophila aromatica</i> of family 
  <i>Plantaginaceae</i> (Plantains)]
<br><a href="lm_ngoomz.html">
<img src="img/hb_ngo_om04k.jpg" alt="Whole Ngo Om plants" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This aquatic herb is native throughout Southeast Asia, extending into 
southern China, Japan and Australia. After the Vietnam war, it was 
brought to North America by refugees, and is now easily available in 
the Asian markets here in Southern California. This plant grows well 
in still water, such as found in rice paddies. It's particularly popular 
in Vietnam, but is also used in China and Japan. In Chinese, Japanese 
and Korean, the name of this herb is the same as for 
<a href="mt_perilz.html">Perilla</a>, a very distantly related herb. It 
is made specific with a suffix meaning green leafy plant (see names 
above).

<h2>Purslane</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Verdolagas (Mexico); Sanhti, 
  Punarva (India); Pigweed, Little Hogweed, <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>]
<br><a href="cn_purslz.html">
<img src="img/cn_pursl06k.jpg" alt="Purslane Stems with Leaves" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This succulent weed common in California vineyards is actually native to India 
and the Near East. It was extensively used in ancient Greece and still appears 
in Mediterranean cuisines. There is evidence it had already migrated to the 
New World well before Columbus. The only other member of the Purslane family 
(<i>Portulacaceae</i>) used as food in North America and Europe is 
<a href="herbs.html#miners">Miner's Lettuce</a>, also known as "Winter Purslane".</p>
<p>Purslane is used raw in salads, as a cooked green similar in taste to 
spinach. It is also used in soups where it's slightly mucilaginous nature 
acts as a thickener. It can be found in markets serving a Mexican community.</p>
<p>Purslane is unusually high in Omega-3 fatty acids and is also a source 
of vitamin C and dietary minerals. It also contains powerful antioxidants 
which may have anti-cancer properties. In India it is used as a liver 
tonic. <a href="cn_purslz.html"><b>Detail and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Rau Dang</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [(Viet), Foo Yip (Cantonese), 
  <i>Glinus oppositifolius</i>]
<br><img src="img/hb_rau_dang02e.jpg" alt="Rau Dang Leaves, Flowers" class=mrg>
<p>
This strong flavored somewhat bitter herb does not yet have a 
common English name, but is popular for certain fish soups and stews in 
Vietnam. Elsewhere it's use is mainly medicinal. A related herb, 
<i>G. lotoides</i>, also native to Africa and Southeast Asia has 
recently been found as an invasive weed in California as well as 
Louisiana and other southern states.

<h2>Rue</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Ruta graveolens</i> Citrus family)]
<br><a href="hb_ruez.html">
<img src="img/hb_rue01k.jpg" alt="Growing Rue Plant" class=mrg></a>
<p>
An intensely bitter herb, rue has faded from the culinary scene except in 
Ethiopia. Once widely used in the Mediterranean region and an important herb 
during the Roman Empire, it is still occasionally called for in traditional 
recipes and also appears as a flavoring in some distilled beverages. The 
leaves are always be used fresh, so you will need it in your garden if you 
wish to use it. Dried fruits are also used in Ethiopia. A common decorative, 
it can be found in the herb section of most well stocked nurseries and is easy 
to grow in temperate climates. The blue-green leaves are very small, about 3/8 
inch long.

[Yerba mate (Spanish); Erva mate (Portuguese); <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i> 
(Holly family)]
<p>An herb native to northern Paraguay and southern Brazil, now widely 
cultivated for making <i>Mat&eacute;</i> a caffinated herbal tea. Teas made from 
this herb are very popular in Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil, northern 
Argentina, and southern Chile, as well as Syria and Lebanon. For details
