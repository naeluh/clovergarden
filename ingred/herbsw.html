<p><big><b>Herbs</b> are generally fresh or dried leaves of low growing 
plants.</big> While there are a vast number of herbs of medicinal interest, 
this page is about those of culinary interest, though most have medicinal 
properties as well.</p>
<p><b>Spices</b> are generally dried barks, berries, buds, seeds and other 
non-leafy plant parts and are to be found on our 
<a href="spices.html">Spices Page</a> but this page includes links to 
related spice items..

<a name="or"><big><b><big>Fresh </big>or<big> Dried?</big></b></big></a>

<p>In general, fresh is better than dried - but this is not always 
true.
<br>In general, 1 teaspoon of dried is roughly equivalent to 1 Tablespoon 
fresh (1 to 3) - but this is not always true.</p>

<p>Never substitute dried ginger for fresh or the other way around - 
the flavors are totally different.</p>

<p>For some recipes, particularly dressings and mixes, dried is called for 
and fresh would definately change the flavor. You need to use your 
own judgement. Also, there are ethnic quirks. In particular Turkish recipes 
prefer dried mint even if fresh is available.</p>

<p>Many cookbooks and recipes, particularly older ones or those calling for 
ethnic herbs, list dried even though fresh would be far better - because 
they expect fresh would be difficult to obtain. This is no longer true in 
many regions of North America where fresh herbs now abound year round.</p>

<p>When using dried herbs you want to get them in the recipe in the early 
cooking stages so they have time to release their flavors. When using fresh 
they generally go in late, some even after taking the pan off the heat.</p>

<p>Many herbs completely lose their character when dried, particularly 
a number of ethnic herbs, but despite this they are sold dried - but using 
them that way is a desparation measure. My listing of individual 
<a href="herbs.html">Varieties of Herbs</a> will have information 
about this.</p>


<a name="buy"><big><b><big>Buying </big>&amp;<big> Storing Herbs 
</big>&amp;<big> Leaves</big></b></big></a>

<a name="fresh"><b><big>Fresh Herbs </big>&amp;<big> Leaves</big></b></a>

<p>Fresh herbs are highly perishable. Some will last only a couple of 
days under even the best conditions. Most will last a week if losely bagged 
in plastic and refrigerated, but some may last a couple of weeks - but 
decline noticeably in quality.</p>

<p>To avoid disappointment, a good rule is to buy the basic herbs you use 
once a week, every week, "whether you need to or not".  These will probably 
include at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat Leaf Parsley</li>
<li>Cilantro</li>
<li>Scallions</li>
</ul>

<p>It is best to buy herbs at an independent market that serves one or 
more ethnic communities. The price is likely to be way below that asked 
in supermarkets, the bunches will be bigger - and they'll be fresher 
because of the fast turnover and likelyhood they were locally grown.</p>

<p>Keep them cool and get them home as soon as possible - then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the rubber bands or other ties and cut off 1/2 to 1 inch of the 
  stem ends - particularly important if you try to refresh wilted herbs.</li>
<li>Remove any substandard leaves.</li>
<li>If the herb is slightly wilted check "Details and Cooking" for the 
  <a href="herbs.html#var">individual herb</a> for the best way to refresh. 
  For parsley and cilantro this is stem end down in a cup with an inch of 
  fresh water for an hour. For basil and mint this is complete immersion 
  for an hour, then dry in the salad spinner.</li>
<li>Shake off any excess water and bag loosely in clean plastic.</li>
<li>Store in the refrigerator in a location where they won't be damaged. 
  In my refrigerator the drawer labeled "Snack Drawer" is actually the 
  herb drawer.  Note that basil and perilla are chill sensitive and should 
  be kept in the wamest part of the refrigerator, probably the door.</li>
</ol>

<a name="dry"><b><big>Dried Herbs </big>&amp;<big> Leaves</big></b></a>

<p>Buy from a source that has high turnover, particularly one that serves 
an ethnic community that makes considerable use of that particular herb. 
Dried herbs lose their flavor rather quickly and you don't want to buy 
packages that are already badly degraded.</p>

<p>Buy only whole leaf or flakes, ground to powder they will be seriously 
degraded by time they're on the store shelf. They are easy to grind in a 
mortar or spice grinder as needed.</p>

<p>Dried herbs should be stored in tightly sealed containers in a cool 
place and away from light, particularly direct sunlight which will kill 
them very quickly.</p>

<p>As a general rule dried herbs should be discarded and replaced about 
every 6 months, but this varies with the particular herb and storage 
conditions.</p>

<a name="drying"><b><big>Drying Herbs </big>&amp;<big> Leaves</big></b></a>

<p>Herbs should be dried quickly in a warm place (but not over 
85&deg;F/30&deg;C with very good air circulation. If practical leaves should 
be removed from stems as flavors may be withdrawin into the stems. 
Never dry herbs in direct sunlight as it will bleach out the goodness 
before they are dry.</p>

<p>One way hebs are dried is hanging upside down in small bunches. another 
is drying on a screen.</p>

<p>Some leaves, including some that are normally useless dried, can be 
dried quickly on a comel, tava or dry frying pan. They will retain good 
flavor for several weeks tightly seales and away from heat and light. In 
particular curry leaves take well to this treatment.<p>


<a name="cook"><big><b><big>Cooking </big>with<big> Herbs </big>&amp;<big> 
Leaves</big></b></big></a>

<p>In general, dried herbs go into the recipe early so they have plenty 
of time to exude their flavors. 
<br>In general, but not always, fresh herbs go in late during cooking, some 
even after the pan has been removed from the heat (Thai basil in particular).
