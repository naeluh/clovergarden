<h1>Hemp Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The Hemp family (<i>Cannabaceae</i>) is a small family of herbs, 
vines, shrubs and small trees, consisting of only about 9 Genera in all.  
While hemp is a very useful industrial, culinary and medicinal plant, its 
use in the United States has been greatly hindered by the misguided and 
totally failed "war on drugs", which has succeeded only in transferring 
billions of dollars to criminals - and providing many thousands of 
lifelong but worthless careers for government employees. This 
latter factor explains why reform will be strongly resisted by the 
government.

<h2>Hemp Seed / Hemp Seed Oil</h2>
<br><img src="img/hp_hemps02e.jpg" alt="Hemp Seeds" class=mrg>
[<i>Cannabis sativa</i>]<p>
Hemp seed has been a provider of nutrition and cooking oils since 
before the dawn of history. Unlike grains, hemp seed has an almost 
perfect protein balance from human nutrition, 20 amino acids including 
all 9 essential amino acids, and in an easily digestible form. Hemp 
is also gluten free. </p>
<p>Hemp seed is  quite available in the United States and can be 
purchased off the shelf at Armenian markets, ordered on-line, or from 
health food stores (higher price). Commercial hemp seed has only trace 
amounts of THC and CBD, but hemp seed, often imported for Canada, must 
be non-viable to be legal. The Feds fear people will grow industrial 
hemp and hide recreational hemp within the plantings.</p>
<p><b>Hemp Seed Oil</b> has what many consider a perfect 3:1 balance 
between Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids. It is, however 80% 
polyunsaturated oils, so it is more vulnerable than almost any other oil 
to oxidation rancidity from storage or heat - not recommended for 
cooking, especially frying. Some products of rancidity are suspected 
carcinogens - but it is this very oxidation (drying) that makes 
high polyunsaturated oils like hemp, flaxseed and poppyseed suitable for 
oil based paints. Hemp seed oil must not be confused with "hash oil", 
which is actually a concentration of resins containing psychoactive 
ingredients.

<h2>Hops</h2>
<br><img src="img/hp_hops03e.jpg" alt="Hops, Leaves &amp; Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Hovenia dulcis</i>]
<p>
The part of the hop vine (actually a "bine" because it climbs by wrapping 
around things) is the female flower, which looks sort of like a paper 
pine cone. Almost all hops are used in the beverage industry, mainly for 
flavoring beer, but also for kvass, some herbal teas and a couple of 
soft drinks. For beer, two types of cultivar are used; flavor hops which 
are boiled with the malt wort, and aroma hops which are added at the 
end or after the boiling.  In times past, many other bitter herbs were 
used to flavor beer, but hops were found to be antibacterial, thus 
providing for a more reliable fermentation.

<h2>Hemp</h2>
<br><img src="img/hp_hempp01e.jpg" alt="Leafy Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Cannabis sativa</i> &amp; <I>Cannabis indica</i>]
<p>
There are many cultivars of <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, but they fall into 
two general categories: Industrial, with negligible amounts of 
THC and CBD, and Recreational / Medicinal, with high amounts of the 
psychoactive THC and CBD. The United States is the only significant 
country that bans growing industrial hemp, out of fear recreational 
hemp could be hidden among the industrial crop. The U.S. Congress came 
down very hard on hemp when they made marijuana illegal - out of fear 
that white girls would go out to music halls, get high on grass and have 
sex with black musicians - I kid you not. Anyone who thinks our current 
Congress critters are stupider than those of "America's Glory Days", 
knows little Congressional history.</p>
<p>Industrial hemp is used primarily for fiber, very useful for many 
industrial and agricultural products, and for seeds and oil. Currently, 
Canada fills the need for those products.

<p>Medicinal hemp comes in two varieties, <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, the 
preferred species for recreational use, and <i>Cannabis indica</i>. 
Indica is considered more sedative and is preferred for nighttime use. 
Sativa is considered more stimulating and preferred for daytime use.</p>
<p>Recreational hemp comes in several forms. Most common is dried 
flowerhead material, "buds", which is smoked by various means. Hashish, 
or "hash" is a concentration of just the glandular hairs from the 
flowerhead, usually pressed into blocks of some or another shape. The 
resin in these hairs contains the psychoactive components. This is the 
form with the greatest culinary association, as it has been used to make 
"hash brownies" and other edible but psychoactive concoctions. "Hash oil" 
is a further refined and concentrated product, usually produced by 
solvent extraction of the resins. The highest grade comes from the 
flowerheads, but it is also recovered from leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Both medicinal and recreational hemp products are highly illegal in 
the United States, by federal law - however, several states have 
legislated much looser laws, most for medicinal marijuana, but a few 
states have legalized recreational marijuana as well, and some 
agricultural states have passed legislation aimed at permitting farming 
industrial hemp. There has yet to be a major legal showdown between 
state and federal laws.
