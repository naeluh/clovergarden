<h1>Kimchee</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
  <p>[kimchi (Korea)]</p>

  <p>Kimchee is not just one thing, though most people are fimilar only 
  with the Napa Cabbage version with red chili. Kimchees are made of many 
  vegetables and other ingredients, in many different ways, and many do 
  not include red chili. I have a book with recipes for over 80 
  varieties, divided into Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn and All Year 
  categories, and I'm sure there are many more.</p>

  It is practically impossible to imagine a Korean meal without a side 
  dish of kimchee, but it is also used as an ingredient in many recipes, 
  most notably Soups, including Pork and Kimchee Soup.

Kimchee is basically salt pickled vegetables, made very similarly to how 
sauerkraut is made in Germany and Poland. The earliest written reference 
to kimchee in Korea dates to the 12th century, but it has certainly been 
made there far longer. Kimchee for winter has traditionally been made up 
in the autumn, and placed in large ceramic jars which were often buried 
in the ground to protect them from the bitter cold of ice and snow.

<p>While here in Los Angeles County, we have many Korean markets, and a 
number of firms making top quality kimchee for them to stock in their 
refrigerator cases, kimchee is also often made in the home, buecause it 
is so easy, and there are so many varieties that are not in the stores.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<img src="img/ig_kimchee01c.jpg" alt="Cabage Kimchee" class=mrg>
<h3>Napa Cabbage Kimchee <small>with</small> Red Chili</h3>
<p>
This is what most people know as Kimchee. It can even be found in regular 
supermarkets, but <u>be warned</u>, supermarket kimchee is usually rather 
inferior. Kimchee is properly purchased from a Korean market in larger 
jars from the refrigerated cases. Dead kimchee is not so good.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Chinese Cabbage, Radish, Green Onion, Ginger, Garlic, 
Red Pepper, Salt, Sugar, Water, Anchovy Extract, Shrimp, Sweet Rice 
Flour.

<h3>Radish Cube Kimchee </h3> 
&nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Paek Kkatugi</i>]
<p>
This winter kimchee is sufficiently popular that the local Korean 
markets always have it in the refrigerated cases. It is easily made and 
takes only a 4 day fermentation.

<h3>Cucumber Juicy Kimchee</h3> 
&nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Oi Nabak Kimchi</i>]
<p>
This easy to make, refreshing Kimchee is popular during the Summer. It 
can be eaten right after it is made, with a dash of rice vinegar, but 
I recommend giving it a full 3 days fermentation for best flavor.

<h3>Cabbage Cut <small>&amp;</small> Jumbled Kimchee</h3> 
&nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Paech'u Mak Kimchi</i>]
<p>
This all season kimchee is similar to the poppular Napa Cabbage Kimchee, 
but is formulated to be easily made with a relatively short fermentation 
time. For details see our recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/kpv_kccabj1.html"><b>Cabbage Cut &amp; Jumbled 
Kimchee</b></a>.

<h3>Cucumber Hot Spicy Kimchee </h3> 
&nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Oi Nabak Kimchi</i>]
<p>
This one doesn't quite qualify as a Kimchee because it is not fermented, 
but it is made so similarly it is called "Kimchi" in Korea
