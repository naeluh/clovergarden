<h1>Holly Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Genus <i>Ilex</i> is the only genus in family <i>Aquifoliaceae</i> 
of order <i>Aquifoliales</i>. Though containing somewhere between 400 
and 600 species, there isn't anything to eat here. Most species in the 
family are at least mildly toxic, and some are quite toxic. A few, 
however, are used to make caffinated teas.

<h2>Guayusa</h2>
<br><img src="img/il_guay01h.jpg" alt="Collected Guayusa Leaves" class=mrg>
[<i>Ilex guayusa</i>]
<p>
This tree, which grows to about 100 feet, is native to the Amazon 
Rainforest of Ecuador. Natives have long harvested the leaves, tied 
them into bundles and dried them to use in making a highly caffinated tea.
</p>
<p>This leaf is now being promoted by the health food industry as yet 
another "super food". Powders are being used in a number of formulations. 
Aside from caffeine, the leaves contain theobromine, usually found in 
chocolate, and substances similar to those found in green tea. They are 
also very high in antioxidants, much higher than green tea.

[Yerbe mate (Spanish); Erva mate (Portuguese); <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i>]
<p>
This shrub, which can grow to about 49 feet, is native to southern Brazil 
and Paraguay. It's leaves are harvested to make a caffinated tea, often 
called "mate", which is very popular in the Southern Cone of South 
America, particularly Uruguay. It is also popular in Syria and Lebanon, 
imported from Argentina.

<h2>Kaushue</h2>
<br><img src="img/il_kaus01h.jpg" alt="Dried Leaves, Tea" class=mrg>
[<i>Ilex kaushue</i>]
<p>
This tree, growing to about 28 feet, is native to most of China. Curled 
dried leaves are used to make a caffinated bitter tea called Ku Ding Cha, 
literally "bitter nails tea", said to have significant medicinal 
properties. In Sichuan and Japan this tea is more often made from a 
Privet, <i>Ligustrum robustum</i>, in which case it will not be 
caffinated.
