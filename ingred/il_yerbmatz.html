<p>This shrub, which in the wild can grow into a tree over 40 feet high, 
is native to southern Brazil, northern Paraguay, and a few patches in Uruguay. 
Its leaves are harvested to make a caffinated tea, often called "mat&eacute;", 
which is very popular in the Southern Cone of South America. It is also 
popular in Syria and Lebanon, imported from Argentina.</p>

<p>This herb was already in use by the indigenous Guaran&iacute; and 
Tup&iacute; peoples of Paraguay in pre-Columbian times. The plant is IUCN 
rated NT (Near Threatened) in the wild, but is widely cultivated in Paraguay, 
Uruguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina.
