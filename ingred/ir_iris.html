<h1>Iris Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
The Iris family (<i>Iridaceae</i>) is a large family of flowering 
plants found in temperate and subtropical climates worldwide, with the 
greatest genetic diversity in southern Africa. Many members are 
popular decoratives, but very few present anything even remotely 
edible. The photo is of <i>Iris douglasiana</i>, native to the coastal 
region from southern Oregon down to central California.</span>

<h2>Saffron Crocus</h2>
<br><a href="ir_saffroz.html">
<img src="img/ir_crocus01k.jpg" alt="Live flower" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Crocus sativus</i>]
<p>The only plant in the Iris family of culinary importance, the Saffron 
Crocus. does not appear in nature - it is sterile, so must have been 
the result of human intervention. It may have originated in Bronze 
Age-Crete, but is now harvested as a crop from Spain through India 
and North Africa. The only part of the plant with culinary use is the 
stigmas, thread like components of the flower. These are used as a 
flavoring and coloring in many cuisines. They must be dried, causing 
chemical changes, before they are effective.</p>
<p>It takes 150 flowers to make 1 gram (0.035 ounce), which is about 
1/2 tablespoon of threads, very loosely packed. These threads must be 
carefully harvested by hand. In North America, a single gram can cost 
between US $2.00 and $16.00 depending on size of package, grade of 
saffron, point of origin and what the retailer thinks he can get from 
his customers.</p>

<p>The largest producer, with something like 90% market share, is 
Iran. Greece is next, then Kashmir and Morocco, with Afghanistan 
rising as Kashmir falls. That available in North America is most 
commonly from Spain, but Persian (Iran) is also available. &nbsp;

<h2>Orris Root</h2>
<br><img src="img/ir_irgerman01h.jpg" alt="Live German Iris Flower" class=mrg>
[German Iris; <i>Iris germanica</i> | Sweet Iris, Dalmation Iris; 
<i>Iris pallida</i>]
<p>
Orris root was once a common medicinal in Western medicine, but has 
fallen out of use. It is still used in perfume compositions, but it's 
only culinary use is as a flavoring for gin. The roots are harvested 
and dried, then aged for about 5 years to develop flavor and aroma.
The photo is of German Iris, a hybrid, developed in Europe, which comes 
in a number of colors.

<h2>Tigridia</h2>
<br><img src="img/ir_tigrida01h.jpg" alt="Live Tigridia flower" class=mrg>
[Tiger Flowers, Shell Flowers; <i>Tigridia pavonia</i>]
<p>
These plants, native to the region from Mexico to Chile, are grown 
today for their large and unusual flowers, but the Aztecs of Mexico 
also ate the roots. Sorry, I don't yet have a recipe (the Spanish 
burned all that stuff).

<p>[<i>Moraea Fugaz</i>]
</p><p>
This plant is native to South Africa, and was a favored food among the 
early Dutch settlers. The bulbs (corms) were peeled and sliced, then 
gently fried in butter. They have a flavor between sweet chestnuts and 
potatoes.
