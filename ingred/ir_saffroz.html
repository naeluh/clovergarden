  [<i>Crocus sativus</i>]
<p>
The only plant in the Iris family of culinary importance, the Saffron 
Crocus, does not appear in nature - it is sterile, so must have been 
the result of human intervention. It may have originated in Bronze-Age 
Crete, but is now harvested as a crop from Spain through India 
and North Africa. The only part of the plant with culinary use is the 
stigmas, thread like components of the flower. These are used as a 
flavoring and coloring in many cuisines. They must be dried, causing 
chemical changes, before they are effective.</p>

<p>It takes 150 flowers to make 1 gram (0.035 ounce). These threads must be 
carefully harvested by hand. In North America, a single gram can cost 
between US $2.00 and $16.00, depending on size of the package, grade 
of saffron, point of origin and what the retailer thinks he can get 
from his customers. The photo to the left shows 1 gram of Spanish 
saffron, with our ubiquitous red kidney bean for size comparison.</p>

<p>The largest producer, with something like 90% market share, is Iran, but 
Iranian Saffron is not available in the United States due to political 
reasons. Greece is next, then Kashmir and Morocco, with Afghanistan rising 
as Kashmir falls. Saffron is also increasingly grown in Australia, 
particularly for medicinal purposes. That available in North America is most 
commonly from Spain and Afghanistan (Persian type). The supply from 
Afghanistan is now uncertain due to the Taliban takeover (2021).

<p>Saffron is used particularly in the cuisines of Spain, Italy, Greece 
and the Islamic regions from Morocco into India, particularly Iran.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Saffron should be purchased as whole threads as 
pictured above, because with powdered saffron or saffron water, you can't 
really know what you're getting. Also, it will keep much longer as threads. 
Several brands are available on the Internet. Trader Joes usually has Spanish 
saffron in tiny glass jars for 2021 US $5.98 for 0.02 ounce (0.56 gram - 
$10.68/gram). Currently (9-2021), Afghan saffron is available for $5.99 / 
gram in 5 gram cans. Prices for Spanish saffron are all over the map, but 
generally significantly less than Afghan, as low as 2021 US $1.25 / gram in 
one ounce cans.<p></p>

<h3>Powdering:</h3> &nbsp; In Iran, Saffron threads are usually powdered 
before soaking in hot water. They can be ground in a small mortar. If not grinding 
well, add a touch of salt grains to help.<p></p>

<h3>Weights:</h3> &nbsp; A quarter teaspoon of saffron powder weighs about 
0.7 grams. 1 gram of threads is about 1/2 Tablespoon very loosely packed.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Kept in a tightly sealed container away from 
heat and light, saffron threads will last well over a year.<p><p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Saffron is very powerful, so is usually used in 
"pinch" quantities or a little larger. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; any oil 
or fat in a recipe will coat the saffron threads and lock in their flavor 
and aroma. The desirable properties are water soluble, so threads or powder 
should be soaked in hot water (some say milk) For 10 minutes or so.  
<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; There is considerable ongoing 
study of the medicinal properties of saffron, which has been 
used as a medicinal for thousands of years. Current research indicates 
it may be effective against macular degeneration, Parkinson's disease 
and other nerve and brain disorders.
