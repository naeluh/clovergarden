<h1>Laurels</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Laurels (<i>Lauraceae</i>) are a moderate size family of 
aromatic trees and shrubs very important for spices and flavorings.
Only one Laurel species, the Avocado, produces fruit significant for 
food and oil - but what a fruit it is - and what oil - with a health 
profile similar to olive oil, but with a buttery taste and it goes 
to temperatures over 500&deg;F/260&deg;C without smoking.</p>

[Persea americana]
<p>
The Avocado tree is the only member of the Laurel family that's a 
significant food producer. Its fruit, the Avocado, is also known as 
Alligator Pear and Midshipman's Butter. Avocado and the Spanish aguacate 
are derived from the Aztec <i>ahuacatl</i>.</p>

<p>Native to the tropical Americas, this fruit is now extremely popular 
worldwide and grown in many countries. Avocado oil is now also popular, 
particularly for high temperature frying - it can safely go to 
520&deg;F/270&deg;C and has a slightly buttery taste. Avocados now have 
their own <a href="ll_avocadz.html"><b>Avocados</b></a> page.

<h2 id="bay">Bay Leaves</h2>
<br>These leaves have been very important in cooking in Europe since at 
least Roman times, and in North America since the European invasion. 
They remain kitchen essentials to this day. In northern India a slightly 
different leaf is used for similar purposes.<p></p>

   <h3>Bay Laurel</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ll_bayfresh01k.jpg" alt="Bay Laurel Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Bay Leaf, Mediterranean Laurel, Sweet Bay, <i>Laurus nobilis</i>]
   <p>
   One of the most ancient and important culinary spices in Europe 
   and the Americas, Bay Leaves are sold for high prices in little jars 
   in the spice section of the supermarket. Look for leaves that are 
   still reasonably green for good flavor. Fresh Bay Leaves are much 
   more aromatic and are easy to grow in Mediterranean like climates. 
   Here in Southern California they are very aggressive growers and I 
   have to hack mine back continually to keep them from overrunning the 
   place.</p>
   <p>The fresh leaves are thought to have psychoactive properties and 
   may have been used by oracles in ancient times but they are so bitter 
   when chewed nobody I know of has tried to confirm this.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="ibay">Indian Bay Leaf</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ll_indian01k.jpg" alt="Three Indian Bay Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Malabar leaf, Malabathrum; Tejpat (Nepal, Assam); Tejpatta (Hindi); 
   Tej Patta (Bengali), Tamalpatra (Marathi); <i>Cinnamomum tamala</i>]
   <p>
   Well known to Roman cooks and still used for beer brewing in the 
   Middle Ages, these leaves are now little used outside of the cuisines 
   of northern India. Native to the Malabar (West) coast of India, they 
   are easily recognizable for having three prominent lengthwise ribs 
   rather than just a central rib (some other South Asian laurels also 
   have three ribs).</p>
   <p>These leaves are considerably stronger than the familiar Bay Laurel 
   and with a distinct overtone of Cassia (what passes for cinnamon in the 
   US). I have found them in jars of cucumber pickles imported from India 
   (India is a very large exporter of pickles). Judging by the color, I 
   presume the photo specimens were gathered from such products.</p> 
   <p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; packages of dried leaves labeled "Indian 
   Bay Leaves" are usually <a href="my_dsalamz.html"><b>Indonesian Bay 
   Leaves</b></a> which are myrtles, not laurels - look for the three ribs. 
   <u>Subst</u>: regular Mediterranean bay leaves with a bit of cinnamon 
   added should work fine.

   <h3>California Laurel</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ll_calif01h.jpg" alt="California Laurel Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Oregon Myrtle, California Bay, Headache Tree, 
   <i>L. Umbellularia californica</i>]
   <p>
   California Laurel is used similarly to the Bay Laurel for 
   cooking but I do not recommend it. Having bit into a California Laurel 
   fruit to see if it really did produce headaches, I had a splitting 
   headache seemingly in seconds. Reportedly some people are sensitive 
   to the leaves even after cooking. California Laurel is easy to tell 
   from Bay Laurel because the leaves are more elongated, pointy and 
   lighter in color.</p>
   <p>It is reported that American Indians in California did eat parts 
   of the fruit, but under very limited conditions, and only the bottom 
   third. The nut, similar to an avocado pit but much smaller, is 
   reported edible after roasting. They are roasted quite dark and 
   described as tasting like roasted coffee or dark chocolate depending 
   on how dark they are roasted. Roasted nuts are ground and used in 
   beverages.

   <h3>Mexican Bay Leaf</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ll_mexbay01h.jpg" alt="Mexican Bay Leaves on Tree" class=mrg>
   [<i>Litsea glaucescens</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub or small tree (up to 20 feet high) is native to southern 
   Mexico and extends down into Central America. It is used in Mexico as 
   a substitute for Bay Leaves in cooking. This plant is considered 
   threatened because it has been over-exploited for culinary, medicinal 
   and religious purposes (celebration of Domingo de Ramos). Local gatherers 
   are not harvesting in ways allowing for regeneration.

<h2 id="cinn">Cinnamon, Cassia &amp; Camphor</h2>
<br>[genus <i>Cinnamonum</i>] &nbsp; These barks used as spices have 
been of great culinary importance (and high price) throughout history, 
and probably long before. They are from tropical trees that can't be 
grown in places like Europe and North America.<p></p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Cinnamonum verum (zeylanicum)</i>]
   <br><h3>Cassia</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Cinnamomum cassia (aromaticum)</i>]
   <br><h3>Pandang Cassia</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Indonesian Cinnamon, Korintje; 
     <i>Cinnamomum burmannii</i>]
   <br><a href="ll_cinnz.html">
   <img src="img/ll_cinnamon01c.jpg" alt="Cinnamon &amp; Cassia Quills" class=mrg></a>
   <p>
   Cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and the Malabar coast of India 
    now grown also in the West Indies and South America. Cassia is native 
    to Burma and is grown in China, Vietnam and Indonesia with Vietnamese 
   (<i>Cinnamomum loureiroi</i>) considered the highest quality. The 
   aromatic bark of both these trees is peeled and dried for use as a 
   spice. The two are easily confused but pretty much interchangeable in 
   recipes.</p>
   <p>Shown are long Cinnamon sticks (top), standard U.S. Cassia sticks 
   (center), broken Cinnamon common in Indian groceries (right) and 
   ground Cinnamon/Cassia (left). Preference for and availability of 
   these spices is a mater of region. Cassia predominates in the U.S. 
   but is difficult to find in Europe where Cinnamon predominates. In 
   Mexico Cinnamon is preferred, so it is widely available here in 
   Southern California. China and Southeast Asia use Cassia almost 
   exclusively. Cinnamon is used in India and Sri Lanka. Cinnamon 
   generally has a cleaner, sweeter flavor and Cassia has a touch of 
   bitterness.</p>
   <p>Pandang Cassia is used for the cheapest and most common ground 
   "cinnamon" in North America. This tree was planted in Hawaii in 1934 
   and has become somewhat of a pest.</p>
   <p><img src="img/ll_cinnamon03c.jpg" alt="Cinnamon &amp; Cassia Quills, comparison" class=mrg>
   Cassia bark is much thicker and often a darker color than Cinnamon 
   which can be almost paper thin. Cassia tends to curl from one side 
   into a cylindrical quill while Cinnamon curls from two sides into two 
   cylinders taking a double scroll shape quill, though exceptions will be 
   found in both cases. Shown are two sticks of Cassia (left), a stick of 
   Cinnamon (top right) and a stick of Cinnamon made up of paper thin 
   layers.

   <h3>Kalingag</h3>
   <br>[<i>Cinnamomum mercadoi</i>] &nbsp; 
   This small tree, growing to about 30 feet high, is found only in 
   the Philippines, where it is used locally as a flavoring. The bark 
   contains a lot of safrol rather than the cinnamaldehyde found in 
   other trees of this genus, so the aroma is of sassafras and it is 
   used for flavoring root beer. It also has a number of medicinal 
   uses. Interestingly, the leaves have the three rib design like 
   <a href="laurel.html#ibay">Indian Bay Leaf</a> trees. This tree is Red Listed 
   as VU (Vulnerable) due to over-harvesting for timber.<p></p>

   <h3>Camphor</h3>
   <br>[<i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>] &nbsp; 
   The Camphor Laurel is native to East Asia where it is used in 
   camphor production, centered now in Taiwan where trees have been 
   replanted so are not depleted as they are in China. The Camphor Laurel 
   has become an aggressive pest in some areas where it isn't native, 
   Australia in particular. Camphor is used medicinally and in plastics 
   but not in food since it is toxic if ingested.<p></p>

<h2 id="other">Other Laurels</h2>
<br>A few other members of the Laurel family have some culinary 
applications.<p></p>

<h2 id="sass">Sassafras</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_sass01k.jpg" alt="Sassafras Leaves" class=mrg>
[<i>Sassafras albidum</i> (North America), <i>S. tzumu</i> (China), 
<i>S. randaiense</i> (Taiwan)]
<p>
The tree that defines the taste and aroma of root beer grows prolifically 
in the Eastern U.S. and into southern Ontario.</p>
<p>Sassafras leaves are naturally mucilaginous and are used to thicken 
and flavor gumbo in Louisiana. Fil&eacute; Powder, sassafras plus other 
herbs and spices, was originally a substitute when okra was out of season 
but now stands on its own. The leaves contain no significant amount of 
Safrole (see below).</p>
<p>Sassafras root is now banned by the FDA since the component Safrole has 
been found to be mildly carcinogenic, but young shoots, leaves and above 
ground bark do not contain significant amounts. Safrole is also controlled 
by the USDEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) because of its use to manufacture 
illicit drugs.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Ispinku</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_ocotea01e.jpg" alt="Dried Ispinku Cupules" class=mrg>
[<i>Ocotea quixos</i>]
<p>
This tree, native to Ecuador and Colombia, is harvested for bark marketed 
as Ecuadorian or American Cinnamon, which is similar to but not identical 
to Asian cinnamon. Locally, the fruit cupules (hard shells around the 
fruit) are harvested and have been used as a spice since the days of the 
Incas. This spice is used for general cooking, but is particularly 
important for food offerings to the ancestors. It is also used to flavor 
an alcoholic drink called <i>alajua</i>.
Oils from this tree present a number of significant medicinal properties, 
but more study is needed for general use. The photo shows dried fruit 
cupules.

<h2>Tola</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_tola01h.jpg" alt="Drawing of Tola Leaf, Flower &amp; Fruit" class=mrg>
[Spicy Cedar; <i>Beilschmiedia mannii</i>]
<p>
Native to West and Central Africa from Guinea Bissau to Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, this small to medium tree bears small fruit that 
turns red when ripe. It holds a single seed which is toasted and ground 
for use as a condiment in soups, rice and vegetable dishes. The aromatic 
leaves are crushed and soaked in water for a couple of days, then strained 
to produce a refreshing beverage. The fruit is eaten raw or incorporated 
into sauces. The bark is pounded and eaten as a condiment with rice. 
In North America, the toasted and ground seeds are available on-line 
from sellers of African food products for around 2018 US $1.75 / ounce.

<p>
This tall tree, native to a small region of Chile, is the only species 
in family <i>Gomortegaceae</i> and the only culinary member of order 
<i>Laurales</i> outside the Laurel family, so we're putting it here. 
This tree produces a soft, sweet yellow fruit about 1-3/4 inches in 
diameter that is used to make a kind of marmalade. The tree is Red List 
status EN (Endangered) due to over-harvesting and land clearing.
