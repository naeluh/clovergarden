<h1>Agave <small>&amp;</small> Sotol</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Agave are large, thick leaved succulents, native mainly to 
Mexico, but extending into North America and as far south as central 
South America. Sotol has a much more restricted range, the border 
region between the United States and Mexico. Both have been important 
food plants and providers of alcoholic beverages. The photo to the left 
is of Foxtail Agave (<i>Agave attenuata</i>) a popular decorative, 
because it lacks teeth and spikes.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Agave &nbsp; - &nbsp; Genus <i>Agave</i></h2>

<p>There are quite a few species of Agave. The ones listed here are 
those most used for food and beverages. Only varieties that are known 
edible should be consumed, and preparation should match traditional 
usage.  Some Agaves contain large amounts of bitter saponins. One, 
the Octopus Agave, is so heavy in saponins it is used to make fiber 
brushes that have plenty of soap built right in. </p> 
<p>Raw Agave sap is acrid and can cause serious dermatitis in sensitive 
people. You should also be careful not to be stabbed by the spikes at 
the end of the leaves, which can cause an effect similar to a serious 
bruise.</p>

<h2>Agave Americana</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_agavea01k.jpg" alt="Live Agave Americana Plant" class=mrg>
[Maguey, Century Plant; <i>Agave americana</i>]
<p>
This agave was originally native to Mexico, Arizona and Texas, but has 
been widely planted as a decorative and has become naturalized in many 
countries around the world. Typically, the leaves are blue-green with 
toothed edges and a strong, very sharp, sometimes toxic, spike at the 
tip, but some decorative varieties have striped leaves and no teeth. 
The plant can grow to 10 feet wide and send up a flower stalk up to 30 
feet tall. It will gather strength for 10 to 30 years, depending on 
conditions, before sending up a flower stalk, after which it is exhausted 
and dies. It will be succeeded by a few suckers at its base which will 
grow into mature plants.</p>
<p>In pre-Columbian times, the flower stalk was often cut off before 
flowering. The plant would continue pumping sweet liquid which would 
gather at the leaf bases. This would be sucked out and lightly fermented 
as the drink pulque. The roots were cooked and eaten. Each flower stem 
produces several pounds of flowers which can be eaten similarly to Yucca 
flowers. Seeds can be ground into flour used for thickening soups or 
mixed with other flours for bread. Young flower stalks can also be 
roasted and eaten.</p>
<p>In producing regions of Mexico, the plants are called Mezcales and 
the distilled alcoholic drink Mezcal is made from them. For this purpose 
the hearts, which may weigh up to 200 pounds, are baked in an oven to 
extract the sweet juice.

<h2>Blue Agave</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_agavet01e.jpg" alt="Live Blue Agave Plant" class=mrg>
[Tequila Agave; Agave azul (Spanish); <i>Agave tequilana</i>]
<p>
This agave is native to Jalisco state in Mexico, favoring altitudes of 
over 5000 feet. The blue-green leaves, which can be up to 7 feet long, 
have many teeth along the edges and a strong sharp spike at the tip. At 
about 5 years they send up a flower stalk about 23 feet high, after which 
they are exhausted and die, succeeded by small suckers around the base, 
which eventually grow into full size plants.</p>
<p>In commercial production, the flower stalks are cut off at about 1 
year so the plant will live longer and produce a heavier heart. These 
hearts are harvested at about 12 years old, when they weigh between 80 
and 200 pounds. They are baked in an oven to extract the sweet juice, 
which is then fermented and distilled into Tequila.

<h2>Hohokam Agave</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_agavem01h.jpg" alt="Live Hohokam Agave Plant" class=mrg>
[Murphy Agave, Murphey's century plant; <i>Agave murpheyi</i>]
<p>
This agave is native to southern Arizona and northern Sonora in Mexico. 
The blue-green leaves, which can be up to 32 inches long and 8 inches 
wide, have toothy edges and a strong sharp spike at the tip. At 
about 10 years they send up a flower stalk up to 18 feet high, but the 
flowers rarely produce fruit and seeds. These plants are propagated 
by suckers around the base after the main plant flowers and dies. This 
species was probably developed over hundreds of years specifically for 
human consumption. It matures in the late winter when other crops are 
scarce, and the leaves contain much less acid and are less acrid than 
those of other agaves. They can be gathered in late winter and early 
spring and cooked for food.</p>
<p>The Hohokam Indians of Arizona cultivated this agave for food and 
fiber, and on a large scale. Agave fields totaling around 20,000 acres 
have been found between Tucson and Phoenix, and there were probably a 
lot more. Cultivation began around 600 CE and extended to about 1450 CE. 
The hearts were harvested just before they sent up a flower stalk and 
weighed about 9 pounds. They were baked for two to three days in large 
pit ovens. The baked hearts tasted much like sweet potato, but contained 
a lot of indigestible fiber. Today this agave is not in cultivation and 
is NatureServe rated G2 (globally imperiled).

<h2>Desert Agave</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_agaved01h.jpg" alt="Live Desert Agave Plant" class=mrg>
[Mescal, Maguey, Century Plant; <i>Agave deserti</i>]
<p>
This agave is native to Southern California, including Baja, and Arizona. 
It comes in two varieties: var <i>deserti</i>, native only to Southern 
California and consisting of numerous rosettes, and var <i>simplex</i> 
consisting of a single or just a few rosettes, and native to both 
Southern California and Arizona. The blue-green leaves, which can be up 
28 inches long and 4 inches wide, have many teeth along the edges and a 
strong sharp spike at the tip. At between 20 and 40 years it sends up a 
flower stalk up to 20 feet high, after which that rosette is exhausted 
and dies, succeeded by the smaller rosettes.</p>
<p>Southern California Indians roasted young flower stalks and flower 
buds, and also the "head", including the leaves.

<h2>Agave Nectar</h2>
<br><img src="img/yu_agavnect01k.jpg" alt="Agave Nectar" class=mrg>
[Agave Syrup]
<p>
This is a food industry deception skillfully marketed to the Yuppie class, 
as a "natural" and "healthy" alternative to High Fructose Corn Syrup 
(HFCS). The Agave Nectar of commerce is made not from agave sap but from 
agave starch. The conversion process is pretty much the same as for 
manufacturing HFCS, but the fructose content is <u>much</u> <u>higher</u> 
than with HFCS.</p>
<p>Agave starch consists mainly of inulin (fructosan), a complex form of 
fructose which ends up as 58% to 92% fructose in the final product, with 
most of the rest being glucose. Vegans often use Agave Nectar in place 
of honey, because honey exploits animals (bees). Apparently the poor 
agave worms crushed to death in the process of making agave syrup are 
not being "exploited". Vitamin B12 content will depend on the number 
and quality of the worms crushed.

   <h2>Common Sotol</h2>
   <br><img src="img/li_sotol01h.jpg" alt="Live Plant" class=mrg>
   [Desert Spoon, Spoon Flower; <i>Dasylirion wheeleri</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native to arid regions in Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico 
   and the states of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in the United States.
   It has a short thick trunk, up to 5 feet long, which may lie 
   horizontally on the ground, topped with a spherical display of long 
   narrow leaves. The leaves are up to 39 inches long and have small, 
   sharp teeth along the edges. These plants send up a flower stalk up 
   to 16 feet tall. Unlike the agave, they do not die after flowering 
   but send up a stalk every few years.</p>
   <p>This plant was a significant food source for the native Indians of 
   the region. The stem bases, once cooked, can be eaten similarly to 
   artichoke leaves, scraping the flesh off with the teeth and discarding 
   the fibrous core, called "quid". This core is so stiff it can be, and 
   has been, used as a spoon, thus the name "Desert Spoon".</p>
   <p>Sap of this plant has been used to make fermented beverages for at 
   least 800 years, and possibly as long as 9000 years. Today it is 
   harvested and prepared similarly to how Agave is prepared for making 
   Mezcal, to make the beverage Sotol. One plant can produce one bottle 
   of Sotol. This beverage has few commercial examples, and is just starting 
   to gain an international reputation. It is made in grades: Plata (unaged), 
   Reposado (aged several months to a year) and A&ntilde;ejo (aged at least 
   one year).

   <h2>Texas Sotol</h2>
   <br><img src="img/li_dasyt01h.jpg" alt="Live Texas Sotol Plant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Dasylirion texanum</i>]
   <p>
   This plant, native to arid regions of Chihuahua, Mexico and the 
   state of Texas in the United States, is much smaller than most 
   Dasylirions, with a trunk no more than 1-1/2 feet long and grass-like 
   fronds up to 3 feet long and 1/2 inch wide, with sharply toothed 
   edges. These plants send up a flower stalk up to 16 feet tall. 
   Unlike the agave, they do not die after flowering but send up a stalk 
   every few years.</p>
   <p>This plant was a significant food source for the native Indians of 
   the region. The hearts were pit baked and dried, then pounded into 
   flour for making bread.
