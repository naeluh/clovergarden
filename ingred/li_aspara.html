<h1>Asparagus</h1>
<br>[Asparagus officinalis]
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Asparagus, native to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, has been 
the great herald of spring since before Roman times. Root clumps called 
crowns push up thick tender shoots which may grow more than 6 inches a 
day. Growers send crews into the field every day to cut those that are 
the right size to market.</p>

<p>Finally the roots become exhausted and the shoots they send are thin 
and fibrous. At this point the grower abandons the field and leaves the 
plants to "fern out", mature and gather energy into the roots for the 
next harvest. For the summer they make lacy green fronds (like the 
related asparagus fern) and in the fall they set red berries, turn yellow 
and dry (the berries are poisonous to humans).</p>

<p>I remember as a child on the farm finding wild asparagus plants and 
munching on the fern like fronds. Thin and fibrous, but they tasted like 
asparagus.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The ancient Romans were very fond of asparagus, and they knew how to 
cook it. One writer described in a recipe that it should be "cooked just 
for moments, like asparagus". Louis XIV of France had special greenhouses 
constructed so he could have asparagus all year. Today asparagus has 
been carried worldwide and it even appears in Asian stir fries. Because 
it fetches a good price it has become a major export crop for some 
countries.</p>
<p>Growers of note - and market seasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Peru</h3> (Sep - Dec and year round) is the second largest 
  asparagus grower. About 35% of the crop is green asparagus for export 
  to the U.S. while nearly all the rest is white asparagus processed 
  into cans and jars for shipment to Europe. An increasing amount of 
  fresh white asparagus is being shipped to the U.S..</li>
<li><h3>Mexico</h3> (Dec - Apr and year round except May) is the third 
  largest grower with the entire crop being green asparagus, nearly all 
  shipped to the U.S. where some is transshipped to Japan.</li>
<li><h3>United States</h3> is the fourth largest grower and by far the 
  world's major importer. U.S. exports are small with most going to 
  Canada and some to Japan and Switzerland.<ul>
  <li><b>California</b> (Jan - May, small crop Sept - Oct) - 75%+ of U.S. 
    crop, all green, nearly all fresh.</li>
  <li><b>Washington</b> (Apr - Jun) - all green, some pickled and frozen.
    </li>
  <li><b>Michigan</b> (May - Jun) - all green - 15% fresh, 38% frozen, 
    62% canned.</li> 
  </ul></li>
<li><h3>China</h3> is by far the largest grower of asparagus. Nearly 
  the entire crop is white asparagus, processed into cans and jars and 
  shipped to Europe and worldwide, but almost none to the U.S. where 
  green asparagus is favored.</li>
<li><h3>Spain</h3> is Europe's largest producer followed by Germany and 
  Greece. Nearly all is white asparagus.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="green">Green Asparagus</h2> 
<br><img src="img/li_aspara22e.jpg" alt="Green Asparagus Spears, 3 sizes" class=mrg>
Green asparagus is the people's choice in North America where very little 
white asparagus is consumed - and that mostly on gourmet plates in fancy 
restaurants. Green asparagus is preferred fresh, and pretty much the 
entire California, Washington and Mexican crops are shipped fresh. 
Michigan produces some fresh but mostly frozen and canned asparagus.</p>
<p>Green asparagus generally comes in the three sizes shown in the photo. 
Thick (center) and "pencil thin" (back) are the normal sizes. Here 
in California we also have a size we can call "wire thin" (front) but 
I'm not sure any of that size is exported. Flavor is similar for all 
sizes but becomes a little more intense in the thinner sizes, which also 
are a little more fibrous. Which size you choose will depend on the 
recipe you choose (or the recipe may depend the size you can get). Thick 
asparagus is often peeled for the largest 1/3, pencil thin and wire thin 
never.</p>
<p>The photo samples were 9 inches long with the thick about 0.7 inches 
diameter (about average) the "pencil thin" about 0.4 inches and the 
"wire thin".25 inches and less diameter. All measurements were made at 
the thick end.

<h2 id="purple">Purple Asparagus</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_asparppl01e.jpg" alt="Purple Asparagus Spears" class=mrg>
Purplish green in color, little of this variety is grown in the U.S. 
but it has some popularity in Europe. It may be a nice color variation for 
raw vegetable plates, but like purple string beans it turns green when 
cooked. Definitely not not worth the extra price if you'll be cooking it.

<h2 id="white">White Asparagus</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_aspara02h.jpg" alt="Field Growing White Aspargus" class=mrg>
White asparagus is the same plant as green, but it's grown with a high 
pile of soil or mulch over it or tented with plastic sheeting. Since it 
sees no light it doesn't develop chlorophyll, but it also develops a 
fibrous skin so it is generally peeled.
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0134</a>
</small>.</p>

<p>White asparagus is the choice of Europe where very little green asparagus 
is consumed. Germany is the largest and most enthusiastic consumer of 
asparagus in Europe and has been increasing production, particularly grown 
under plastic sheeting for early harvest.</p>

<p>White asparagus has little flavor compared to green. Chefs like it, I 
think, because it provides body with almost no flavor to interfere with 
their most delicate sauces. It has to be cut rather short as well as 
peeled because the base is very fibrous. Personally I think this stuff is 
beyond redemption, but I'm not a gourmet, a gourmet chef or a German so 
what would I know?</p>

<p>The most commonly available white asparagus in California is from Peru, 
7 inches long and 0.45 inches diameter - a size called "Standard". &nbsp; 
Large, Extra Large and Jumbo are also listed but I think 
those sizes go to restaurants. Standard and large are PLU #4522, Extra 
Large and Jumbo #4523.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Asparagus</h3> is a good source of vitamins A, C, B6, 
thiamin, folic acid, potassium, and obviously fiber (especially if you 
don't peel the lower stems). While low in sodium and calories, it is a 
rich source of rutin and a good source of glutathione (GSH), a powerful 
antioxidant and anti-carcinogen. It has no fat or cholesterol.</p>
<p>Asparagus is a powerful diuretic and has been used medicinally for that 
purpose since ancient times. It also contains sulphur compounds that 
cause a noticeable odor in the urine - but many (as many as 60%) are 
genetically unable to smell this odor at all. The sulphur compounds have 
no known adverse health effects, in fact, sulphur is often deficient in 
the average diet.
