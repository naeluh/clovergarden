<h1>Asparagales - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>Formerly, Asparagus was a modest family in the Lily 
order, but in 1998 the APG reorganized Monocots in a very big way. 
<i>Asparagales</i> is now an Order, on the same level as <i>Liliales</i>, 
and has laid claim to a large number of the families once considered 
"Lilies".</span>

   <p>
   The Onion genus (<i>Allium</i>), which includes Onions, Garlic, 
   Leeks, Chives, Shallots, Scallions, Ramps and others is critical to 
   almost every cuisine in the world, except a few Hindu and Buddhist 
   sects and the Jains all of whom forbid the entire genus. They use 
   asafoetida to try to close the flavor gap (asafoetida, like onions, 
   is high in sulphur).  This very important genus of vegetables has its

   [Genus <i>Agave</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Genus <i>Dasylirion</i>]
   <p>
   Agave is an important food and beverage plant, native to arid regions 
   of Mexico and extending into the southwest of the United States and as 
   far south as central South America. Sotol, which is similarly used, 
   has a much more restricted range, through the U.S. / Mexico border 
   region. Both plants are also popular decoratives for dry landscaping.

   [<i>Asparagus officinalis</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native to most of Europe, Western Asia and parts of 
   North Africa. It is depicted as an offering on and Egyptian frieze
   dated to about 3000 BCE, and was a very favored vegetable during the 
   Roman Empire.  This vegetable has its own

   [Asperge des bois (French); Wild Asparagus, Prussian asparagus, 
   Pyrenees star of Bethlehem, Spiked star of Bethlehem; 
   <i>Ornithogalum pyrenaicum</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native to southern Europe and Anatolia. In the west it 
   grows as far north as southern England. The name "Bath Asparagus" is 
   from it having been common in the woodlands surrounding the town of 
   Bath in England. It hasn't been sold in England since about 1939, but 
   is still harvested in the wild, possibly overharvested. It may be 
   in cultivation in France, and apparently some is cultivated in the 
   United States, as I have seen a photo of fresh stalks in a Boston 
   market. Young stems with unopened inflorescence are cooked pretty much 
   the same as regular asparagus.

   <p>
   These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Polynesia, Melanesia, 
   New Zealand, Australia and naturalized in Hawaii. They have been 
   valued by indigenous peoples for the high sugar content of their 
   rhizomes and stems. We have given the three most important species 
   their own <a href="li_cabtree.html"><b>Cabbage Trees</b></a>

   &nbsp; - &nbsp; Species <i>C. quamash</i>, <i>C. howellii</i>, 
   <i>C. scilloides</i> and possibly others]
   <p>
   Camas is particularly dense in the northwest of North America -  
   British Columbia, Canada, down into central California in the United 
   States. There is at least one species native to the Midwest and 
   C. scilloides is in the Atlantic region from Ontario down to eastern 
   Texas. They can color entire fields and prairies when in bloom, and 
   were an important food source for many Indian tribes. The main problem 
   is that various Deathcamas species (Genus <i>Melanthiaceae</i>) inhabit 
   the same fields, and are hard to tell from Camas when not in bloom.
   </p>
   <p>Northwest Indians and European settlers alike ate a lot of this 
   plentiful food source. The bulbs were gathered in autumn, after the 
   flowers withered, and were usually boiled or baked in pit ovens. 
   they were also dried and pounded into flour. Camas bulbs taste much 
   like sweet potato, but sweeter.

   [Funkia, Plantain Lily; Urui, Ginbo, Giboshi, Oobagiboshi (Japan); 
   <i>Hosta sieboldiana</i>; (obsolete <i>H montana</i>) and possibly 
   other species]
   <p>
   Hostas are native to northeastern China, Korea, Japan and the Russian 
   Far East. They are popular decoratives in other regions because they 
   grow well in shade.  Commercially, Hosta is grown in greenhouses 
   (mostly in Japan) and available in late Winter and spring. Regionally, 
   wild Hosta is available in the Spring, but the leaves are tough and 
   bitter so only the stems are used. Hosta is toxic to dogs, cats and 
   horses, but is edible by humans, just slightly bitter.</p>
   <p>Wild plants have short stems, while greenhouse grown plants 
   have long white stems because they are banked with rice husks to 
   blanch them. Greenhouse plants are usually harvested at about 11 
   inches long. They are cooked like asparagus, cutting them into 3 
   pieces (leaves and two half stems). They must be cooked in boiling 
   salted water, the stem bottoms first, the stem tops, and finally the 
   leaves, all just long enough to be tender. They may then be used in 
   various ways. This plant is mucilaginous, with a taste like 
   asparagus, but a touch of bitterness like lettuce.	The lily-like 
   flowers are also edible and often used as a decoration, particularly 
   in deserts.

   <p>
   This plant, native to New Zealand, has leaves up to 24 inches long 
   by up to 4 inches wide, and it puts up flower stalks up to 3 feet high. 
   It is found in the northern quarter of the South Island and in the 
   North Island. There is evidence the Maori farmed Renga Lily, but today 
   it is used mostly as a decorative, though some are gathered in the 
   wild for food and medicinal uses. Traditionally the rhizomes 
   (underground stems), which grow to 1-1/4 inch diameter, were baked 
   in pit ovens.

   This plant, native to the central and eastern parts of North America, 
   produces unbranched leaf stems from one to several feet long. These 
   sprout from rhizomes (underground stems) which have been used as food 
   by the natives of North America, treated much like potatoes. Young 
   shoots were also eaten, cooked similarly to asparagus.

   flower buds which open into brownish green tubular flowers. The flower 
   stalks can be up to 24 inches high. The plant grows in rocky and 
   cultivated soils.</p>
   <p>The part eaten is the bulb from which the plant sprouts. It is 
   cultivated in Apulia and Basilicata in southern Italy. In Greece and 
   particularly Crete, it is considered a delicacy gathered in the wild. 
   In Italy and Greece The bulbs are boiled in several changes of water, 
   pickled, and packed in olive oil with herbs. In Greece and Crete the 
   bulbs may be an ingredient in omelets.

   [Gawar Patha (India); <i>Aloe vera</i> syn: <i>Aloe barbadensis</i>]
   <p>
   This large (to 39 inches tall), thick leaved succulent is native to 
   patches of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, apparently in 
   remnants of a vast dry forest that once covered the whole region, 
   mostly desert now. It was taken to China and Europe in the 17th 
   century and is now naturalized in many regions of the world. 
   There are over 500 species of Aloes, mostly in Africa, but only a few 
   have medicinal uses and only Aloe Vera has culinary uses. Not all 
   Aloe Vera varieties are considered edible, the main edible one being 
   var <i>Chinensis</i>.</p>
   <p>Studies of Aloe Vera's medicinal, cosmetic and culinary properties 
   are woefully inadequate and often contradictory. What seems fairly 
   certain is that only the gel inside the leaves should be consumed 
   and only after cooking. The latex in the skin layer is a strong 
   laxative and somewhat toxic. The gel is only mildly laxative and 
   mildly toxic, but consumption should be limited.</p>
   <p>The gel is used commercially in yogurt, beverages and some 
   desserts, as well in many cosmetic and skin care products. The main 
   regions for culinary use are India, Singapore and Malaysia. &nbsp;

   <p>
   Asphodels are native to the Mediterranean region with some ranging 
   into central Africa and India. Some have become naturalized in the 
   United States, Australia and New Zealand and are considered troublesome 
   invasives. The photo shows <i>Asphodelus ramosus</i>, a branched 
   species, though most have a single unbranched flower spike.</p>
   <p>In ancient times, Asphodel roots were eaten by the poorest Greeks. 
   In recent times the leaves have been used to wrap Italian Burrata 
   cheese - if the leaves are no longer green, the cheese is too old. In 
   Sardinia it is valued for a premium grade honey, and in Apulia, in 
   southeastern Italy, unripened flower buds are picked, blanched in 
   boiling water and preserved in Olive Oil as a condiment.
