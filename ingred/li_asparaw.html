</ul>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Asparagus</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Select</h3> asparagus of a size appropriate to the recipe you will 
use (or select a recipe appropriate to the size asparagus you can get). 
For green asparagus the common sizes are "thick" (about 0.70 inch 
thick)  and "pencil thin" (about 0.40 inch thick). The "pencil thin" 
size has a more intense flavor but is also more fibrous and cannot be 
peeled. In California we also have "Wire Thin" (about 0.25 inch thick).
All measures are at the thick end.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Purchase as close to need as possible to avoid 
flavor loss. Usually you chose to cook Asparagus when you find it very 
fresh and at a price you can afford.<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The stalks should be fresh, plump and without any wrinkling which 
comes from dehydration. Shriveled asparagus becomes bitter and off-flavor 
and cannot be recovered. Discard any like that.</li>
<li>Thicker asparagus tips should be tight and smooth with little or no 
evidence of "ferning out". Very thin asparagus commonly has started to 
fern out and this is OK if it's not gone too far.</li> 
<li>Look out for tip rot - the tip points become dark and soft. 
Asparagus like this can be used by cutting off the mushy part, but that's 
usually the best part and it's a sign of long storage and serious flavor 
loss.</li>
<li>Look for bundles of uniform size so they will all cook the same.</li>
<li>White asparagus: &nbsp; watch out for stalks that have started to 
shrivel and mold at the base end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; When you have the asparagus home immediately 
remove any rubber bands, cut off the bottom 1/4 inch and stand the spears 
in a bowl with an inch of water in it. Let them refresh for at least an 
hour. Then put them in a plastic bag longer than the spears by at least 
an inch but open at the top to avoid tip rot. Refrigerated, really fresh 
spears will keep for up to a week but they steadily lose flavor so should 
be used as soon as possible.<p></p>

<h2 id="serv" class=lrg>Serving Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Asparagus is notorious for making wine taste bad - and deservedly so. 
To eliminate this effect dress the asparagus with a little salt and lemon 
juice. My <a href="../recipes/gjd_lemonbutter1.html">Lemon Butter Sauce 
#3</a> works fine for this, even if you're not having wine.</li>
<li>Unpeeled asparagus served full length (any size) is going to be 
fibrous enough to be a problem - and cooking longer just makes this 
problem a whole lot worse. Either cut it to convenient lengths or make 
sure diners have something to cut it with - and <u>don't overcook</u>, 
it should still have a faint crunch.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking Asparagus</h2>

<p>The big problem with cooking asparagus is the spears are not uniform 
from end to end. The tender tips cook quickly while the rest of the spear 
needs more time the farther down you go.</p>

<h2 id="prep">General Prep</h2>

<p><b>IF</b> you will not be peeling the asparagus, snap the tough base 
end off at the lowest point where it'll actually snap cleanly.</p>

<img src="img/li_asparap01e.jpg" alt="Peeled Asparagus Spears" class=mrg>
<h3>Peeling:</h3> &nbsp; Cut the tough base off right at the point where 
it starts to turn purple, then white. That should be at least an inch 
below the snap point. Use a sharp vegetable peeler and start at about  
half way down the spear and peel right off the base end. You definitely 
lose diameter by peeling, but you partially make up for it by being able 
to use at least another inch at the bottom.
<p>White asparagus needs to be cut at about the snap point because it's 
very fibrous at the base. You also need to peel it from relatively high 
up the stem.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> asparagus ends and peelings are often simmered in water 
to extract their flavor. The water is then used to make asparagus soup or 
for some similar use.

<h2 id="steam">Asparagus Steamer Method</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top>
<img src="img/li_asparasteam02c.jpg" alt="steamer" class=mrg></td>
<td class=top>
This method is for unpeeled asparagus and works best with fairly thin 
spears but is OK for moderately thick ones.  Yes, I know, my asparagus 
steamer is not "gourmet", but it holds a satisfying 1-3/4 pounds of 
spears - about what you'd get snapping 2 pounds, and works just fine. 
I made it from a tomato can by punching a lot of holes in it using a 
hole punch. You can get shiny expensive ones, even ones with their own 
special pot, from any gourmet outlet.<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Select a pot tall enough to take the prepared asparagus spears 
standing upright with the lid fit on tight - measure in advance.</li>
<li>Fill the  pot with enough water to go about two thirds the way up the 
spears. Bring the water to a boil.</li>
<li>Fill the asparagus steamer rack with asparagus. Put rack and 
asparagus into the pot and put the lid on. If your asparagus will be 
very loose in the rack it will be easier to put the rack in first and 
then drop the asparagus into it.</li>
<li>Cover and let boil over high heat. Pull a spear a little early to 
test doneness...
<br><b>Pencil thin asparagus</b> 4 to 5 minutes,
<br><b>Thick asparagus</b> 6 to 8 minutes.
<br><b>Wire thin asparagus</b> 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 minutes. </li>
<li>If your asparagus is loose in the rack just pull the spears out with 
tongs. If it's jammed tight, tilt the pot over the sink to drain out the 
water. Then you can snag the steamer out horizontally with some 
convenient utensil so you don't spill the spears.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="peel">Cooking Peeled Asparagus</h2>

<p>Use a sufficiently large saut&eacute; pan. Bring plenty of water to a 
rolling boil. Drop the spears in, cover and bring back to a boil as 
quickly as possible. Keep the water at a gentle boil for 6 to 7 minutes 
depending on thickness. Test a spear for doneness. Remove the spears with 
tongs or a strainer ladle.</p>
<p>White asparagus needs a little more time, 7 to 8 minutes for "Standard" 
size, more for larger.</p>
<p>You can also steam peeled asparagus instead of boiling it. Generally 
this will be in a wok with a steamer grid and tight cover because most 
vegetable steamers are nowhere near large enough for full length 
asparagus. For moderately thick asparagus steam covered for 9 to 10 
minutes.</p>

<h2 id="not">Cooking Unpeeled Asparagus</h2>

<p><b>"Pencil Thin" Asparagus:</b> &nbsp; Snap off tough bottoms and use 
the same method as for Peeled Asparagus above, cooking for 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 
minutes depending on thickness. "Wire Thin" is done in 3 to 4 minutes. 
The spears will be a bit fibrous, nothing you can do about that but 
overcooking <u>makes it worse</u>. If you steam instead of boil the 
time should be 7-1/2 to 8-1/2 minutes for pencil thin.</p>

<p><b>Thick Asparagus:</b> &nbsp; After snapping, cut the spears in 
thirds keeping the different sections separate. Bring plenty of salted 
water to a rolling boil in a pot or saut&eacute; pan. First put in the 
base ends and let boil for 1-1/2 minute. Then put in the midsections and 
boil for 1 minute. Finally put in the tip ends and boil until tender. 
<u>Total</u> time is 7 to 8 minutes depending on thickness.</p>

<p>You can also steam unpeeled asparagus instead of boiling it. Steam the 
bottom end segments for 2-1/2 minutes, then add the middle segments and 
steam for 2 minutes. Finally add the tips. <u>Total</u> steaming time 
should be 10 to 11 minutes depending on thickness.</p>

Here is a place you will want rather thin asparagus so it's reasonably 
uniform from end to end and sturdy enough to take the handling.
<ol>
<li>Preheat the broiler or prepare the grill.</li>
<li>Snap tough ends from the asparagus spears, coat them lightly with 
  olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>For broiling place spears on an oiled foil in a single layer. For 
  grilling, arrange them on the grill. Turn once about 3/4 through 
  cooking. They are done when the tips and leaf scales are lightly 
  browned and the skin starts to blister. This will be in about 4 
  minutes or less.</li>
