<p>While the three important species in genus <i>Cordyline</i> vary 
tremendously in size and form, from large branching trees to small 
grasslike plants, all were used in very similar ways by peoples of the 
South Pacific and Southeast Asia. Stems and rhizomes (underground 
storage stems) were steam cooking in appropriate sized pit ovens for 24 
hours or more to convert starches into sweet fructose. This would be used 
both as a source of carbohydrates and to sweeten less palatable foods. 
They have largely fallen out of use due to convenient availability of 
refined sugar products in the modern world. Some is still used in Hawaii 
in production of the alcoholic beverage <i>Okolehao</i>.
<p>Today, these plants are mainly used for landscaping and gardens, and 
C. fruticosa in particular has been bred into many stunningly decorative 
varieties.

</p><p>
This tree is native to New Zealand, populating the entirety of both the 
North and South Islands, except the extreme southern corners of the 
South Island.	The photo shows a medium size tree in full bloom. They 
can get very large, 66 feet tall and 7 feet in diameter at the base. 
Because it has been in New Zealand for 15 million years or so, this 
species has developed varieties to fit all the climate zones of the 
islands.</p>
<p>Below ground these trees produce carrot shaped storage rhizomes 
(underground stems) up to 10 feet long, storing fructose in the form of 
fructan. These rhizomes and the stems above them were very important 
to the Maori, particularly in the southern regions where sweet potatoes 
did not grow well. They would steam cook them in large pit ovens which 
converted the fructan into sweet fructose, which could then be used 
for energy, or to sweeten other foods, particularly fern roots.</p>
<p>Europeans, of course, fermented this sugar content and distilled it 
for alcoholic beverages. These were often of pretty rough quality, but 
easy to sell to whalers and sealers who stopped at New Zealand for 
supplies.</p>

<p>The growing tips of the branches were also snapped off, the leaves 
stripped off and then eaten either raw or cooked as a vegetable.

<p><big><b>Cabbage Palm</b></big> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Good Luck Plant, 
Palm Lily, Ti Plant; Ki, La'i (Hawaiian); Ti Pore (Maori); Si (Tongan);

<br><img src="img/li_cabtf01h.jpg" alt="Growing Plant" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
</p><p>
These plants, growing to 13 feet tall, are native to Southeast Asia, 
Papua New Guinea, Melanesia, northeast Australia and parts of Polynesia. 
They are not native to New Zealand, but were brought from Polynesia by 
the Maori when they invaded the islands and slaughtered the more peaceful 
former inhabitants. It is also not native to Hawaii, but was brought by 
Polynesians when they settled the islands.</p>
<p>The Maori consider this species to be more desirable than the ones 
native to New Zealand because of its higher sugar content. In Hawaii, 
the natives found starch in the rhizomes could be converted to sugar by 
baking. The rhizomes would then be soaked in water to extract the sugar 
and the sugar solution fermented into a kind of beer. After the Europeans 
came, this beer was distilled into a liquor called <i>Okolehao</i>. 
Adulteration began immediately, and today it a disreputable concoction 
similar to a sweet fruit brandy, and at a mere 65 to 80 proof, not 100 
to 135 proof as in former days.</p>
<p>Note that not all varieties are neatly stacked like the one in the 
photo. Today there are many varieties valued as decoratives, particularly 
in Hawaii, including green, red, purple and yellow varieties, and 
variegated varieties with mixes of any of those colors. There are some 
that are an amazingly brilliant hot lipstick pink - see photo at top 
of page.

This plant, which grows to about 3 feet tall, rarely taller, is native 
to the northern peninsula of the North Island of New Zealand. It was 
cultivated by the Maori for carbohydrates and to use as a relish for 
sweetening other foods. They considered this species less desirable 
than C. fruticosa or C. australis.
