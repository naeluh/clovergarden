<hr class=hr2>
<p>
There are a number of rather different members of the Onion family 
sold as "Chives", usually without modifiers, so it's a bit confusing. 
To straighten this out, and to provide an easy link from recipes, we have 
created this Chives page.</p>

   [<i>Allium schoenoprasum</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Europe, North America and Asia, these chives are what is 
   expected in American and European recipes. The stems of these chives 
   are round and tubular, similar to scallion stems but more perfectly 
   round and much smaller. Flavor is similar to scallions but the texture 
   is much different due to the small size. The photo specimens, purchased 
   from a Korean market in Los Angeles are unusual in including the white 
   part.</p>
   <p>Small packets, usually cut to about 6 inches long (green part only), 
   can be found in nearly every supermarket in North America, usually at 
   rather high prices, but they are rare in ethnic and produce markets 
   here in Southern California, Garlic Chives prevail in these markets. 
   Round chives are often chopped fine and sprinkled over salads and 
   other dishes as garnish, but are also used within recipes, 
   particularly for fish and potatoes.

   <h2 id="chivea">Garlic Chives</h2>
   <br><img src="img/on_chive16f.jpg" Alt="Bunch of Garlic Chives" class=mrg>
   [Chinese Chives; Gau choy, Kow choi (China); Gui chai (Thailand); 
   Maroi nakupi (Nepa); Buchu (Korea); Nira (Japan); Ju hpu (Burma) 
   Ju Myit (roots Burma); <i>Allium tuberosum</i>]
   <p>
   Used throughout East and Southeast Asia, these chives have more of a 
   mild garlic flavor than regular chives. The leaves are thin narrow and 
   flat, not "V" shape.  They are used in stir fries, and as an ingredient 
   in dumplings, soups and flat breads. While found in all the Asian 
   markets here in Southern California, Korean markets may have them in 
   more than one size. I have purchased them up to 19 inches long. Though 
   the flavor is a bit different, they can be used to replace regular 
   chives. Small ones have a very short storage life, at most a couple 
   of days in the refrigerator, but I've had larger ones last a week.</p>
   <p><b>Roots</b> of this plant are a popular item to accompany snacks 
   in Burma, and are chewed on for their flavor. For this use they are 
   usually called "Leek Root", or <i>ju myit</i>.

   <br><img src="img/on_chivef04f.jpg" Alt="Bunch of Garlic Flower Stalks" class=mrg>
   [Chinese Flowering Chives; <i>Allium tuberosum</i>]
   <p>
   These are the tall flowering stalks of Garlic Chives, always sold 
   before the flower heads open (as shown in the photo). They are sold 
   separately from the leaves (and at a higher price) and are a popular 
   vegetable for Asian soups and stir fries. They store much better 
   than the leaves, more than a week or so loosely wrapped in plastic 
   and refrigerated.

   <h2 id="chivet">Tarah Chives</h2>
   <br><img src="img/on_chiveg15f.jpg" Alt="Bunch of Tarah Chive Leaves" class=mrg>
   [Tara, Tarah (Persian); <i>Allium ampeloprasum</i> var. 
   <i>persicum</i>]
   <p>
   This is what is sold as "chives" in many Southern California produce 
   markets. particularly those serving Near and Middle Eastern 
   communities. While Asian Garlic Chives have flat leaves, these leaves 
   markedly "V" shaped like those of leeks - in fact, if you read the 
   binomial name, they are a variety of leek greens. They are wider, a 
   bit firmer, and stronger in flavor than Garlic Chives, but last a 
   couple of days longer in the fridge.
