[<i>Lilium davidii</i> var. <i>unicolor</i>]
<p>
   This lily is native to mountainous regions from northwestern China 
   south as far as Yunan. They are also found in the far northeastern 
   tribal regions of India as well as Bhutan and Tibet. This lily, 
   growing to about 5 feet tall, produces crisp sweet edible bulbs 
   up to 1-3/4 inches diameter. These are used in stir fries and in 
   various other ways. The flowers are not aromatic, so are not used 
   for food. The center for cultivation of this lily is around the city 
   of Lanzhou in the Gansu province of northwest China. This is 
   <u>not</u> the lily used to make dried lily buds called 
   <a href="li_daylil.html"><b>"Golden Needles"</b></a>. That one 
    is actually in the Asparagus order.

<h2>Lily Bulbs</h2>

[Bai He (China)]
<p>These bulbs are not solid, but flake apart into many "petals". In the 
front of the photo is a bulb turned stem end up and pried apart. These 
petals are crisp and sweet.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are now fairly easy to find in Asian 
markets serving a Chinese community. They are packed 4 to a small 
vacuum pack bag. They weigh about 1 ounce each, so a 4 ounce package. 
The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US $1.99 per package, or about $7.96 
per pound. The package has two bulbs behind a clear window and two 
bulbs hidden by color and writing. Always squeeze the invisible ones 
to make sure they're firm.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Separate the bulb into its separate petals and 
pinch off any discoloration. They will always be brown at the stem 
end of the petals. Keep in cold water until needed.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The petals should be rather minimally cooked 
and should remain crunchy. If overcooked they lose their sweetness and 
become starchy.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; These lilies grow easily in most temperate 
climates. Bulbs with some root threads at the bottom can be planted.
They will produce as many as 20 orange flowers per plant, and spread 
rather easily.
