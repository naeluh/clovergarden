<h1>Daylily - Golden Needles</h1>
<br>[Orange Daylily, Tiger Daylily, Tawny Daylily, Fulvous Daylily, 
Tiger Lily (not unique), Ditch Lily, Wash-house Lily; 
<i>Hemerocallis fulva</i> and other species (see below)]
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
While flowers of some other daylilies are also eaten, the Orange 
Daylily (photo to left) is the primary culinary species. Flowers, flower 
buds, dried flower buds and tuberous roots are all eaten. These plants 
are not true lilies, but members of the large and very diverse 
Asparagus Order (<i>Asparagales</i>, family <i>Xanthorrhoeaceae</i>).<p>

<p>This is <u>not</u> the lily that provides the famous edible lily 
bulbs of China. That one is a true lily, the 
<a href="li_davidz.html"><b>Lanzhou Lily</b></a>.</p>

<p>The Orange Daylily is native to the Caucasus. east through the 
Himalayas and on to China, Korea and Japan. It has become naturalized 
in Europe, much of the United States and parts of Canada, New Zealand, 
India and other regions, often becoming an aggressive invasive weed that 
pushes out native plants.

<h2 id="gneed">Golden Needles</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_lilybud03d.jpg" alt="Dried Lily Buds" class=mrg>
[Gum jum choi, huang hua cai (Chinese); Dok mai jeen (Thai); 
<i>Hemerocallis</i> species]
<p>
These flower buds of the most aromatic of the daylilies (the ones on this 
page) are used fresh or dried where they are grown, but are available 
dried in most Asian markets worldwide.</p>
<p>These come in two ways: &nbsp; the bright yellow will probably have been 
treated with sulphur dioxide, the untreated will be a browner yellow (see 
<a href="li_daylil.html#health"><b>Health &amp; Nutrition</b></a> below). If dull dark 
brown they are too old.</p>
<p>Golden needles are a common ingredient in China, Japan, Korea, 
Thailand and Vietnam. They are often paired with wood ear mushrooms in 
soups and stir fries.</p> 
<p><b>Prep:</b> &nbsp; Pour hot water over them and let them soak for 
between 1/2 and 1 hour, depending on dryness. Longer soaking will deplete 
the flavor. When they will be included in soups or similar they are 
often tied in a knot so they don't get all tangled up, which also 
helps prevent them from losing flavor to the liquid.

<h2>Citron Daylily</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_daycit01e.jpg" alt="Flowering Citron Daylily Plants" class=mrg>
[Long Yellow Daylily; <i>Hemerocallis citrina</i>]
<p>
This is one of the aromatic species used for dried buds called "Golden 
Needles". It is native to East Asia, including China. The yellow flowers, 
which are also edible fresh, are nearly 6 inches across the points.

<p><b>Sulphur Dioxide:</b> &nbsp; This gas is a powerful preservative, 
maintaining color, softness and protecting from bacteria, but around 
1% of Americans may have sulfite sensitivity. Among asthmatics this may 
be as high as 10%. In the United States, any product that has over 10 
parts per million of sulfites must declare sulfites on the label.</p>
