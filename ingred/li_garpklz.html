<p>
Pickled Garlic is a much used ingredient in Thailand. Thai garlic 
is in smaller heads than what we see in North America, with a larger 
number of much smaller cloves. Typical heads are about 1-1/2 inch 
diameter, and they are often pickled as whole heads. These cloves (and 
often the pickle juice) are used in recipes and as a condiment. 
Typically, Garlic, Water, Distilled Vinegar, Sugar, Salt, Sodium 
Benzoate (0.05%).

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; these can be found in most markets that 
serve a Southeast Asian community. The photo specimens were purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), a 16 ounce 
jar for 2016 US $2.69.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp;  Unopened jars will last at least a year. 
Once opened, they will last a week or so at room temperature, but should 
be refrigerated for longer storage.<p></p>

<h3>Usage:</h3> &nbsp; The cloves, freed from the tougher surrounding 
skins, can be eaten skin-on, but many recipes say to skin them. 
This is most easily done by making a thin cut across the root end 
of the head before separating the cloves. The pickling juice is also 
called for by many recipes.

Pickled Garlic can also be easily made at home, though a bit differently, 
since our garlic heads and cloves are much larger here in North America 
- see our recipe <a href="../recipes/siv_garpkl1.html"><b>Pickled 
Garlic</b></a>.
