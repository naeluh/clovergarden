<p><big>Formerly, Lilies were practically synonymous with Monocots, and 
included <i>Asparagales</i> (Asparagus), <i>Dioscoreales</i> (Yams) 
and other families. In 1998  the APG reordered Monocots in a big way. 
<i>Asparagales</i> and <i>Dioscoreales</i> are now orders on the 
same level as <i>Liliales</i>, and there isn't a lot edible left in 
<i>Liliales</i>.</big>

   This lily is native to mountainous regions from northwestern China 
   south as far as Yunan. They are also found in the far northeastern 
   tribal regions of India as well as Bhutan and Tibet. This lily, 
   growing to about 5 feet tall, produces crisp sweet edible bulbs 
   up to 1-3/4 inches diameter. These are used in stir fries and in 
   various other ways. The flowers are not aromatic, so are not used 
   for food. The center for cultivation of this lily is around the city 
   of Lanzhou in the Gansu province of northwest China. This is 
   <u>not</u> the lily used to make dried lily buds called 
   <a href="li_daylil.html"><b>"Golden Needles"</b></a>. That one 
    is actually in the Asparagus order.

   This genus of more than 70 species is native to North America, mostly 
	 in the U.S. Western States. The bulbs of may species were important to 
	 the American Indians, eaten both raw and cooked, and young flower buds 
	 were also eaten. The bulbs were also eaten by early Mormon settlers in 
	 Utah during times of crop failure. They aren't much eaten now, so I 
	 have no information on how they taste.

	 This Trout Lily is native to Japan, Korea, the Russian Far East and 
	 northeastern China, but is best known in Japan. It produces a small 
	 root tuber about 3/8 inches in diameter and 2-3/8 inches long, from 
	 which was made a starch powder called <i>katakuriko</i>. The starch 
	 used today as "katakuriko" is usually potato starch, because the real 
	 thing would be prohibitively expensive. The Katakuri lily is getting 
	 very scarce. It propagates very slowly, taking 7 to 8 years before it 
	 flowers. It is not farmed, but is subject to poaching, not for starch 
	 these days, but for sale to wild flower enthusiasts.

   </p><p>
	 This herbaceous plant grows to 39 inches high. It is identifiable by 
	 its stems being kinked at each leaf, and a kink in the flower stem 
	 which remains with the fruit (see photo). It is native to the northern 
	 United States, including Alaska, western Canada, Greenland, Europe 
	 from Spain to Ukraine and as far north as Poland. It is also found 
	 in East Asia and Eastern Russia.</p>
	 <p>Tender young shoots taste similar to cucumber and were eaten as 
	 raw greens by American Indians in eastern North America. The juicy 
	 berries, tasting much like watermelon, are also eaten, but have a 
	 mildly laxative effect, thus the name "Scoot Berries". When young, 
	 this plant resembles plants of the highly toxic <i>Veratrim</i> 
	 genus, so should not be eaten unless identification is positive.

   </p><p>
   Native to North America from Minnesota to the Atlantic including 
	 eastern Canada, and as far south as Florida, this plant grows to 30 
	 inches high with one or two tiers of leaves. It is reported to be 
	 naturalized in Bermuda. Only two tier plants have flowers. The lower 
	 tier leaves are from 2-1/2 to 5 inches long.</p>
   <p>The berries of this plant are not edible, but the crisp root tuber 
	 is, and smells and tastes like cucumber. This plant is now rather 
	 scarce, so eating it is to be discouraged.

   </p><p>Native from Central Mexico to Chile, and the Caribbean, Brazil 
   and Argentina, this vining plant grows to about 10 feet long. The root 
   tubers, more than 20 on a well developed plant, are up to 2 inches in 
   diameter and have been used as food through its range since prehistoric 
   times. It's wide range is probably because of its desirability as food 
   and ease of cultivation.</p>
   <p>The tubers are high in starch, and are generally boiled and 
   pur&eacute;ed. They have a light texture and a pleasant flavor.

<p><big><b><big><i>Smilacaceae</i> Family</big></b></big></p>

<p>Smilax is a genus of more than 240 species of plants found in 
tropical and warm temperate climates worldwide. We have listed here 
the culinary species well known in the West, but there are others that 
have had minor food usage by native Americans.

   </p><p>
	 This prickly vine is native to Nova Scotia and Ontario in Canada, and 
	 south to Florida and as far west as Texas. It produces small blue-black 
	 berries in September, but they are not edible. Fresh young shoots are 
	 considered excellent when cooked like asparagus. Young leaves and 
	 tendrils can be cooked like spinach or used raw in salads. The roots 
	 have a gelling agent that can be extracted and used as a thickener.	
	 This, or a very similar Smilax species, is used the same way in the 
	 Republic of Georgia

	 <i>Native to Mexico and Central America, S. aristolochiifolia</i> and 
	 <i>S. ornata</i> are the two sarsparilla plants most famous for use of 
	 their roots as medicinals and for flavorings. They were particularly 
	 used to flavor soft drinks (sarsaparilla, root beer), but also baked 
	 goods, dairy desserts and candies. The taste is sweet, but also 
	 bitter, so they have usually been combined with other flavorings to 
	 counter the bitterness.</p>
	 <p>As a beverage flavoring, in the West they have been largely 
	 replaced by artificial flavors, but are still used in southern 
	 India for a popular summer drink, Nannari. In southern India they 
	 are also pickled and use as a condiment with Curd Rice. These roots 
	 still have many significant medicinal uses.
