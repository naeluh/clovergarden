<h1>Onions, Leeks, Shallots, Garlic, etc.</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The Onion genus (<i>Allium</i>), which includes Onions, Garlic, 
Leeks, Chives, Shallots, Scallions, Ramps and others is critical to 
almost every cuisine in the world, except a few Hindu and Buddhist sects 
and the Jains who forbid the entire genus. They use asafoetida to try to 
close the flavor gap (asafoetida, like onions, is high in sulphur).
</p>
<p>Onions are highly nutritious, providing important sulphur 
compounds, polyphenol and antioxidants. Medicinally, they provide some 
protection against cancer and diabetes and aid bone strength and 
digestion. The great pyramids of Egypt were built by local farmers, 
working when the Nile flooded their fields, powered by a diet of 
bread, beer (a whole lot of beer) and onions.

  </ul>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General and History</h2>

<p>Alliums are <a href="lily.html"><b>Monocots</b></a>, and originally 
classified as "Lilies" (class <i>Liliopsida</i>) but the APG (Angiosperm 
Phylogeny Group) really upset that applecart. They now belong to Order 
<i>Asparagales</i> (Asparagus Order), along with many other former 
"Lilys". Alliums come in a wide variety and grow in nearly every region 
of the Northern Hemisphere, and a few in South America and tropical 
Africa.</p>

<h2>Religious Considerations</h2> 

<p>All Alliums are forbidden to Jains, as well as some sects and classes 
among the Hindus and some Buddhists. In North America the Hari Krishna 
sect says that is because odors of the breath offend Lord Krishna, but 
in India it is because they are suspected of raising passion and 
"inspiring to lust". For this reason they are traditionally forbidden to 
monks and widows (the many unfair restrictions on widows in India are 
starting to fade). These sects and classes use 
<a href="py_asafoz.html">Asafoetida</a> to provide a similar sulphurous 
sophistication to their recipes. Perhaps asparagus should be banned too, 
for causing odors of the pee? After all, onions are members of the 
Asparagus order.</p>
<p>Muslims are strongly discouraged from eating garlic raw, and are 
forbidden to pray at a mosque if they have recently done so. Muslims are 
allowed to eat garlic if they have cooked it long enough to deodorize it. 
Muhammad is on record as disliking the eating of garlic.</p>
<p>In Europe garlic is considered protective against vampires, werewolves 
and demons, and against monsters in the Philippines.</p>
<br>

<h2 id=onion class=lrg>Bulb Onions</h2> 

<p><img src="img/on_redwht03f.jpg" Alt="Large Red and White Onions" class=mrg>
The common Onions (<i>Allium cepa</i> var <i>cepa</i>) are one of the 
most important agricultural crops in the world, and were probably one of 
the very first. They are considered important medicinals for various 
ailments, are highly nutritious, store well, and are particularly 
important to the flavor of the majority of recipes in the world. They 
are prepared in many ways, using techniques tailored to specific recipes, 
but take care - screw up the onions for your dinner recipe and you might 
as well send out for pizza.<p>

These onions probably originated in Western Asia. It is certain they 
were being cultivated in the Mediterranean region, particularly Egypt, 
at least 5000 years ago. They were soon grown in India (though banned 
by some religious factions there) and were finally carried to China, 
where they are unpopular and called "Foreigh Garlic". The word "foreign" 
in Chinese dialects implies "inferior". The Chinese do use some very 
large Scallions - see <a href="li_onion.html#welsh"><b>Welsh Onions</b></a>.
</p>

<p>The ancient world had only a few varieties of onion, but today hundreds 
of cultivars have been developed for specific purposes, regions, and month 
of maturity. As with so many fruit and vegetable varieties now grown 
worldwide, many important varieties were developed in California, which 
grows more than 25% of the U.S. onion crop. Texas is also a significant 
developer, particularly of sweet onions.</p>

<p>Specific cultivars are of little culinary interest but are absolutely 
critical to onion growers. For instance, onions start to bulb at a 
specific day length. The wrong cultivar for a latitude may never bulb 
or it may bulb too soon, resulting in undersize onions. Classifications 
of culinary interest are:
<ul>
<li><h3>Size</h3>
   <br>The National Onion Association defines a medium onion to be 5 
   ounces. Onions that small are hard to find in Southern California 
   onion bins, so I, and some other cooks, prefer a 6 ounce onion, which 
   produces 1-cup chopped small.
   <table id=onsize>
   <tr><th class=tab></th><th class=sl>Size</th>
   <th class=sl>Weight</th><th class=sl>Chopped</th></tr>
   <tr><td><br></td><td>Small</td><td>4 oz - 5 oz </td><td>1/2 cup</td></tr>
   <tr><td><br></td><td>Medium &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>5 oz - 7 oz </td><td>1 cup</td></tr>
   <tr><td><br></td><td>Large</td><td>7 oz - 10 oz &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>1-1/2 cup</td></tr>
   </table>
</li>

<li><h3>Color</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>White</b> are preferred in Mexican cuisine and by onion processors. 
    The flavor is simpler (cleaner) but they are pretty much interchangeable 
    with yellow onions for cooking</li>
  <li><b>Yellow</b> are the standard onion found everywhere. They come in 
    "sweet" and "storage" varieties and in many sizes.</li>
  <li><b>Brown</b> is a controversial classification among onion experts. 
    For culinary purposes it's just another name for yellow.</li>
  <li><b>Red</b> onions are popular sliced in salads for their attractive 
    color pattern but they may stain some cooked dishes. They are the 
    standard cooking onion in much of India and Southeast Asia, along 
    with Shallots.</li>
  </ul><p></p></li>

<li><h3>Sweet vs. Storage</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Sweet Onions</b> have a high water content and are lower in the 
    sulphur compounds that make onions strong. Mildness and relatively 
    large size make them the darling of the fast food hamburger trade, 
    and for onion rings. See <a href="li_onion.html#sweet">
    <b>Sweet Onions</b></a> below.</li>
  <li><b>Storage Onions</b> are your common supermarket varieties, red, 
    white and yellow. They come in a range of sizes from grape to melon 
    and are drier and relatively strong compared to sweet onions. Keeping 
    properties are much better than for sweet onions - weeks to months 
    depending on season.  See <a href="li_onion.html#yellow"><b>Onions</b></a> below.
    </li>
  </ul><p></p></li>

<li><h3>Scallion / Green Onion</h3> - [UK Spring Onion] - Scallions are 
  onions that never produce a bulb or are harvested before they start 
  to form a bulb. The leaves taper from white at the base to deep green 
  over most of their length. Some cultivars that would bulb in northern 
  regions can be grown as scallions farther south.  For details see 
  <a href="li_onion.html#scal"><b>Scallions</b></a>.
  <p></p></li>

<li><h3>Shape</h3> &nbsp; 
  <br>Shape has no effect on strength and flavor but can be critical to 
  culinary textures.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Flattened Globe</b> onions are particularly attractive for 
    slicing for hamburgers or for onion rings, as the shape maximizes 
    yield and uniformity.</li>
  <li><b>Elongated</b> onions are preferable for slicing lengthwise into 
    wedges for stir frying and such.</li>
  </ul></li>

<h2 id="yellow">Yellow Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_yellow01h.jpg" Alt="Three Yellow Onions" class=mrg>
[Brown Onion, Spanish Onion (most of North America), Storage Onion]
<p>
This is the most common onion in North America and generally the lowest 
cost. They vary in size from less than 4 ounces to well over 1 pound, and 
in color from greenish yellow to as dark as the photo specimens, depending 
on variety (there's an ideal variety for every growing region) and length 
of storage. The largest of the photo specimens was 3-5/8 inches diameter 
and weighed over 11 ounces.  In cooking it can be used interchangeably 
with white and red onions, but salads and salsas are more fussy.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="ored">Red Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_red03f.jpg" Alt="Red Onions, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Spanish Onion (New York and New Jersey only), Purple Onion (Europe, 
parts)]
<p>
Popular raw in salads, these globe shaped onions have relatively thick 
layers and thicker dried skins. When cooked most of the color is lost, 
but they are the most popular onion for cooking on the east coast of 
India. They are preferred for growing in some regions because they're 
more resistant to blight than yellow or white onions.</p>
<p>When caramelized this onion goes quite dark and a bit sticky, but has 
good onion flavor. Of the photo specimens, the big one with leaves was 
5-1/2 inches in diameter and weighed 2 pounds 3-1/4 ounces. The regular 
ones were 2-7/8 inches in diameter and weighed 6-7/8 ounces.</p>

<h2 id="owhite">White Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_wht02f.jpg" Alt="White Onions, various sizes" class=mrg>
These offer a slightly cleaner, simpler flavor than regular yellow onions 
but with the same onion bite. Mexican recipes always call for white 
onions which are traditional there, and for some applications the clean 
white color is desirable. For cooking there really isn't a noticeable 
difference between the two, so substitute yellow onions if you don't have 
white. Of the photo specimens, the big one with leaves was 4-1/2 inches 
diameter and weighed 2 pounds 2-1/8 ounces. The regular ones were 
2-7/8 inches diameter and weighed 7 ounces.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Bermuda Onion</h2>
<br>An extinct variety of yellow onion (RIP 1985). <a href="li_onion.html#spain">
Spanish Onions</a> are sometimes mistakenly called Bermuda Onions.
<p></p>

<h2 id="cipol">Cipolline Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_cipol03e.jpg" Alt="Cipolline Onions, wholse and cut" class=mrg>
These are a traditional Italian onion. They are somewhat sweeter than yellow 
onions, and much less tear producing. Small ones are often roasted over 
charcoal on a long skewer interspaced with chunks of meat. They are rather 
disk shaped with the largest from the photo batch 2.6 inches diameter and 
1.2 inches high. The batch varied in size from 2.0 to 2.6 inches, with an 
average weight of 1-3/4 ounces. Purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2021 US $0.69 / pound.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id=spain>Spanish Onion</h2>
<br>Properly, this is a spherical yellow onion variety midway between 
sweet and storage onions. With a water content higher than storage onions 
they aren't as durable but will last longer than sweet onions.
<p>Unfortunately the term "Spanish Onion" has been degraded to mean 
regular non-sweet yellow onions in most of North America, but in New York 
and New Jersey it means red onions. In the UK it means a mild white 
onion. In Spain, onions are all <i>Cebollas</i>, which may be <i>Nueva</i> 
if freshly picked or <i>Roja</i> if red, nothing more.<p></p>

<h2>"Pearl Onion"</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_pearl02e.jpg" Alt="Colored Pearl Onions" class=mrg>
[<i>Allium cepa</i>]
<p>
These are not true <a href="li_onion.html#pearl">Pearl Onions</a>, which are a variety 
of leek, but what passes as commercial pearl onions today. They are made 
small by using a special variety and overcrowding in the field. These are 
more economical to grow because real pearl onions take two years to 
mature. They are easy to tell apart, as these are layered like other 
onions, while the real ones are a single stem base.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sweet" class=lrg>Sweet Onions</h2>
<br>These are the darling of the hamburger stand. Unusually mild because 
of low sulphur and high water content, they are suited to be the raw 
onions for the mass market. Many varieties are rather large so they make 
hamburger size slices, and some varieties are rather flat, maximizing the 
number of large slices or rings from each onion.
<p>Most North American varieties of sweet onion were developed in Texas, 
starting with Bermuda onion seeds from the Canary Islands. These were 
selected and hybridized in various ways. Some varieties cannot 
propagate but have to be planted from seeds specially produced by 
seed growers from two varieties.</p>

   <h3 id="omaui">Maui Onion</h3>
   <br><img src="img/li_onmaui01h.jpg" Alt="Bin of Maui Onions" class=mrg>
   This famous variety of sweet onion is grown on the Hawaiian island of 
   Maui. Like most American sweet onions it is of Texas origin, but is 
   smaller than most of the mainland varieties. It hits the market early 
   in the season so it fetches a good price, lowest cost from May to 
   August, higher from September to April. It's skin is yellow to light 
   brown, and it's flesh is a very light yellow.
   <p>Attempts to grow Maui onions on the mainland are imperfectly 
   successful. The appropriate growing climate eliminates much of the 
   country and their unique flavor owes a lot to the red soil of the 
   Haleakala volcano in which they're grown. Even if you live in a 
   southern state and have a recently active volcano in your back yard, 
   continental volcanos probably spew a mix of minerals different from 
   mid-ocean rift volcanos, so you still won't have authentic Maui 
   onions.

   <h3 id="vidal">Vidalia Onion</h3>
   <br><img src="img/on_vidalia02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Vidalia Onions" class=mrg>
   Varieties of sweet onion grown in Vidalia Georgia that have been 
   marketed intensely and very successfully. Formerly available only in 
   the spring, some are now stored in an oxygen free environment and 
   released in the fall. Because of their high water content they cannot 
   be stored for a long period. 
   <p>The Vidalia Onion is actually Granex, developed in Texas. At first 
   all Vidalias were transplants shipped from Texas, but with the 
   development of herbicides to keep weeds down they were able to be 
   grown from seed. These have a somewhat flattened shape. The photo 
   specimens were typically 4.5 inches diameter, 2-7/8 inches high and 
   weighed 16 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="1015">Texas 1015Y</h3>
   <br><img src="img/on_1015t02k.jpg" alt="Texas 1015 Onion" class=mrg>
   [PLU #4161]
   <p>
   This sweet onion was developed in the early 1980s at Texas A&amp;M, 
   and first named for its ideal planting date. It was renamed Texas 
   SuperSweet, but distributors insisted they didn't want Texas 
   SuperSweets, they  wanted 1015s. These are grown in Texas and normally 
   available from April to mid June, but methods like oxygen free storage 
   have been developed to extend availability. The photo specimen was 
   3-5/8 inches diameter, 3-1/4 inches high and weighed 11-3/8 ounces.</p>
   <p>This is actually only one of a number of sweet onions grown in 
   Texas, where onions are the leading vegetable crop, but it's the most 
   famous.

<h2 id="scal">Scallion / Green Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_scal11f.jpg" Alt="Untrimmed Scallions" class=mrg>
[Spring Onion (UK); <i>Allium cepa</i>]
<p>
Scallions are onions of varieties carefully chosen to not bulb before they 
reach harvest size. Generally, in the markets they are cut to about 13 
inches long from the base of the bulb, but the photo specimens were 
untrimmed and were up to 34 inches long. Recipes calling for "3 scallions" 
are highly imprecise because scallions sold in North America vary from 1/4 
inch to 7/8 inch diameter at the bulb end. Figure a standard scallion is 
5/8 inch at the bulb and 13 inches long - adjust for the size you have on 
hand.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="scall">Scallion / Green Onion - Large</h2>
<br><img src="img/li_scall02f.jpg" Alt="Fresh Korean / Chinese Scallions" class=mrg>
[Welsh Onion, Chinese / Korean Scallion; Japanese Bunching Onion; Dae-Pa 
(Korea); Negi (Japan); Escallion (Jamaica); <i>Allium fistulosum]</i>
<p>These don't quite belong here, being a different species, but this is 
probably where people will look for them. They are shown with a medium regular 
scallion for comparison.</p>
<p>This is the traditional Onion of China. Some Chinese even today won't use bulb 
onions because they are "Foreign" (lit. foreign garlic). In Chinese dialects, 
"foreign" is a synonym for "inferior". Bulb Onions were brought to China from 
India, possibly over 2000 years ago, but certainly by Europeans 500 years ago. 
</p><p>The photo specimens have been trimmed to 15-1/2 inches, and are 1.1 
inches diameter. These were purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles 
(La Ca&ntilde;ada) for 2021 US $1.99 for the pair. Korean markets carry 
them fairly frequently.</p>


<h2>Mexican Onion</h2>
<br><img src="img/on_mex05f.jpg" Alt="Fresh Mexican Onions" class=mrg>
[Summer Onion; <i>Allium cepa</i>]
<p>
These are very similar to scallions, but the variety is selected to bulb. 
They are picked when the bulbs reach about 3/4 inch diameter. The largest 
of the photo specimens was 7/8 inch diameter. These are very fresh 
onions, and both the bulbs and leaves may be used.

<br>The name "Shallot" is used for several small Allium species, but here 
in North America it generally means a variety of the <i>Allium cepa</i>

<h2 id="garl" class=lrg>Garlic</h2> 

<p>Garlic (<i>Allium Sativum</i>) is probably native to Central Asia, 
but has been in cultivation for well over 7000 years. It was already in 
common use in Egypt during the building of the pyramids. Today it is 
indispensable in nearly all cuisines of the Western Hemisphere, and has 
been carried to the New World by the Spanish, French and Portuguese. 
Of course, certain sects and classes in India are forbidden to use it 
as explained above.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of garlic with differing characteristics 
(see Note <a href="li_onion.html#o02">O2</a>). Unfortunately the only garlic available
in most of our markets is a single variety grown in China.</p>
<p>Raw garlic can cause unpleasant smelling breath and sweat when 
consumed. This is not a problem when garlic is cooked as it becomes 
mild and sweet, even if a whole lot of it is included in a recipe. 
Unfortunately, cooking seriously reduces its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Garlic has been used as a powerful medicinal for thousands of years 
and over most of the Western world. It is used to treat bronchitis, 
high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries tuberculosis, liver

   <h2>Garlic &nbsp; - &nbsp;  Heads <small>&amp;</small> Cloves</h2>
   <br><img src="img/on_garlic06f.jpg" alt="Garlic, Hardneck &amp; Softneck" class=mrg>
   Of the many varieties of garlic, there are two basic types: Hardneck 
   (left in photo) and Softneck (right in photo). The hardneck type has 
   large, rather separate cloves, while the softneck has tight cloves 
   with a lot of very small ones near the center.
   <p>Softneck is grown by the Chinese and others who do bulk production 
   because it is more durable in storage, while small growers often grow 
   hardneck garlic because it is otherwise a more desirable product and 
   popular with shoppers at farmer's markets.</p> 
   <p>As a garlic plant matures, it develops multiple centers and then 
   splits into segments called "cloves", which will later sprout as 
   separate plants. A group of cloves under a single wrapper constitutes 
   a "head" of garlic.</p>
   <p>When a recipe calls for a "clove of garlic" it means the large outer 
   cloves of the head. These should be at least 1-1/4 inches long and 5/8 
   inch wide, weighing at least 6 to the ounce. You can use several inner 
   cloves to make up the same weight.</p>
   <p>Garlic cloves may begin to sprout, forming a green shoot in the 
   center. Many writers say these sprouts have a more pungent taste than 
   the rest of the clove and recoommend removing them. This is not so - 
   careful testing has show it is the cloves themselves that are more 
   pungent, not the sprouts. A garlic clove old enough to start to 
   sprout has lost water, some of it to the sprout itself, so its 
   pungency has become more concentrated.</p>


   <h2>Chinese Garlic</h2>
   <br><img src="img/on_garlic06c.jpg" alt="Chinese Garlic head" class=mrg>
   In times past, nearly all garlic sold in North America was grown in 
   Gilroy, California. Today, most of our markets carry only a single 
   variety grown in vast quantity in China. While I find Gilroy garlic 
   superior, it is difficult to find even here in California.
   <p>Chinese garlic exporters have been convicted under U.S. unfair 
   trade laws. In response, the Chinese set up garlic companies, export 
   huge amounts at artificially low prices, then close the company before 
   U.S. regulators can respond. The day they close one company they 
   reopen under another name, often in the same building. Rinse and 
   repeat.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, when possible (it's seasonal) I buy my garlic 
   at Certified Farmer's Markets, where I can be sure it's locally grown, 
   relatively fresh, complies with U.S. trade laws and doesn't contain 
   any weird chemicals used to make it grow faster. Trader Joe's is my 
   alternate source as they sell garlic labeled "Product of USA".</p>

   This is the leek commonly found in North America in practically every

   culinary purposes a "medium leek" is cut to 13 inches long (excluding 
   roots) and weighs about 9 ounces with a root end about 1.6 inches 
   diameter. Prepared for use it will weigh about 5-3/4 ounces. The photo

   <p>
   Elephant Garlic looks like a giant garlic head, tastes a lot like 
   garlic, can be used in place of garlic, but it's not actually garlic - 
   it's a leek. The flavor is milder than real garlic and some people 
   prefer that, especially when it is included raw, such as in salads and 
   salad dressings. Young flower heads can also be cooked as a vegetable. 
   The photo specimen, shown with two large cloves of regular garlic in 
   front, was 3-1/2 inches in diameter and weighed 6-3/8 ounces. Some 
   sources relate Elephant Garlic to Giant Russian Garlic, but that is 
   not correct. Giant Russian is actually garlic.

   True pearl onions were once grown commercially, but are now mostly 
   grown in home gardens, mainly for pickling, and are popular in 
   northern Europe. Commercial "pearl onions" are generally regular 
   onions made tiny by overcrowding in the field. Real pearl onions 
   have only one layer, not multiple layers like a regular onion. 
   They have fallen out of favor commercially because they take 2 years 
   to form a mature bulb.

   Asia, including Japan, Mongolia and eastern Russia. It is now also 
   cultivated to some extent in Cuba, California and Hawaii. While both 
   greens (tubular, like scallions) and bulbs are usable fresh, the bulbs

   particularly popular in Vietnam and Japan, especially to accompany 
   spicy curries (yes, Japanese curry, adopted from the British Navy

   Ramps are native to the Appalachian mountain chain from South Carolina 
   north into Canada. They are particularly popular in West Virginia and 
   Quebec, Canada. Both the scallion like bulbs and the leaves are eaten 
   and they are described as being like a combination of onion and garlic. 
   Very seasona1, they are available only from late winter through early 
   spring.

   <p>While there are ramp festivals in Virginia and West Virginia and

   are available only through gourmet outlets at absurd prices. Commercial 
   production is experimental and seems to work only in a forest setting.

   This plant, related to Chives, is widely distributed across Europe, 
   including the British Isles. It is usually gathered in the wild, but 
   every year there are cases of poisoning from mistaking Lily of the 
   Valley, Autumn Crocus or Arum Lily for Ramsons. At early stages of 
   growth these may resemble Ramsons. The bulbs and flowers are edible, 
   but it is mainly the leaves that are used, in salads, as an herb or 
   as a cooked vegetable and in soups. In Russia, flower stems are 
   preserved in salt and eaten as a salad. In Armenia, stems are pickled 
   in brine for use on appetizer platers (right photo). Leaves are used 
   as wrappers when making some versions of Cornish Yarg cheese. The 
   leaves are used to make pesto in regions deficient in basil.

   <p>
   This onion is native to Siberia or northern China. The name does not 
   indicate origin, or even popularity in Wales. It comes from the Old 
   German "welsche", meaning foreign, having come from the far northeast. 
   These have hollow leaves like common onions (<i>A. Cepa</i>) but also 
   have large hollow scapes (flower stalks) and never form a bulb. They 
   can withstand frost, but not a hard freeze.</p>
   <p>In the West these are used mainly as Scallions, but in much of 
   China they are the main cooking onion, instead of regular bulb onions.  
   Those are considered "foreign", and in Chinese dialects "foreign" is a 
   synonym for "inferior". Bulb onions were probably brought to China 
   from India 2000 years ago, but certainly were brought there by 
   Europeans before 1600 - Chinese xenophobia has a long memory.  The 
   photo specimens were purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles. 
   The longest was 24 inches (not counting roots) and just over 1 inch 
   diameter at the white end. Even larger varieties are grown in China.

   <p>
   This onion has been genetically identified as a cross between Common 
   Onion (<i>A. cepa</i>) and the Welsh Onion (<i>A. fistulosum</i>). 
   The common English name, Egyptian Onion, is a complete misnomer, as 
   these have never been popular in Egypt. They are now thought to have 
   been brought from India by Romani people. The bulblets range in size 
   from less than 1/4 inch to about 1-1/8 inch diameter. They leaf and 
   grow at the top of the scape (flower stalk) until it falls down, 
   after which they root where they fell. The larger bulblets are often 
   pickled, while the smaller are used in soups and the like.

   American Indians throughout that region, usually as an addition to 
   meat dishes, but in California often as a main dish. It contains a 
   significant amount of inulin, an indigestible fart producing sugar, 
   so it is usually given a long cooking time to break the inulin down 
   into simpler sugars. This plant can be quite invasive in more fertile 
   regions.

   in Cuba where it is now grown in home gardens for culinary use. The 
   bulbs are small and covered by a tough fibrous skin, but the flavor 
   is very onion-like. It was formerly gathered by American Indians and 
   early European settlers for use in cooking, but it's safety has been

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; The commonly eaten <i>Alliums</i> are safe to 
eat in any quantity you are likely to consume. They are low in sodium, 
free from fats and cholesterol and contain a pretty good mix if vitamins 
and minerals, particularly sulphur, which is deficient in many people's 
diets.<p></p>

<h3>Preparing:</h3> &nbsp; The outer layers of Onions and Shallots are 
higher in some important nutrients, so you should peel off the minimum 
amount of layers. If you are going to fry the onions until browned, you 
may have to peel one layer deeper to get even browning. For complete 
details of see our <a href="li_onionw.html">Working with Onions</a> 
page.<p></p>

<h3>Tears:</h3> &nbsp; When damaged, the cells of Onions, Shallots and 
some other <i>Alliums</i> release enzymes which combine with sulphur 
compounds to produce propanethiol S-oxide vapors. When these reach the 
moisture in your eyes they form Sulphuric Acid, which stings, causing 
increase in tear production to wash it away. The intensity of this 
effect depends on how much sulphur was in the ground the plants were 
grown in, and how badly the bulb is damaged. It helps if the bulbs are 
refrigerated before cutting. To minimize damage use a very thin, razor 
sharp knife like a Santoku.<p></p>

<h3>Medicinal:</h3> &nbsp; Onions, garlic and leeks have played an 
important role in traditional medicine and healing since before the 
dawn of history. Both internal and topical applications have been 
common. Today they are being studied for their anti-cancer properties, 
in hopes varieties can be developed particularly high in these cancer 
fighting elements.

<p>Other characteristics being studied are the ability of onions to lower 
blood pressure, control blood clotting, reduce blood cholesterol and 
improve the ratio of "good" to "bad" cholesterol. Anti-bacterial 
characteristics are also gaining attention, particularly for fighting 
drug resistant bacteria.</p>

<h3>Diabetes <small>&amp;</small> Sugars:</h3> &nbsp; Onions contain a 
modest amount of sugars and have a very low glycemic index. Sugar 
content is 9.93 grams per cup (210 grams). This consists of 30% Fructose, 
47% Glucose, 23% Sucrose.<p></p> 

<h3>Vampires:</h3> &nbsp; Garlic is reputed to repel vampires, a 
characteristic important to the health of any person set upon by them. 
This has not been confirmed by controlled scientific studies. No such 
studies have been conducted due to insufficient numbers of vampires 
volunteering to participate. Garlic is also said to be effective against 
Demons and Werewolves. In the Philippines, it is reputed to drive off 
monsters.<p></p>
