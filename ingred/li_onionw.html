<h1>Working <small>with</small> Onions</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Onions are a critical element in nearly all cuisines, worldwide, 
except for Jains, some Hindu sects and classes, and a few Buddhists. Pay 
attention when cooking them - screw up the onions and you might as well 
call out for pizza.

<h2 id=weigh class=lrg>Weights <small>&amp;</small> Measures</h2>

<p>Recipes should always specify the weight of onions "as purchased" 
presuming a standard amount of loss from peeling. The U.S. National 
Onion Association defines a medium onion to be 5 ounces. Onions that 
small are hard to find in Southern California onion bins, so I, and 
some other cooks, would prefer 6 ounces, which produces 1-cup chopped 
small. What recipe writers in England or Bangladesh consider a "medium 
onion", I haven't a clue, but in southern India shallots are often 
called "small onions".</p>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Onions</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Selection:</h3> You will want several sizes of yellow onions to fit 
various recipes, and perhaps some other varieties: White, Red, Sweet, 
depending on the recipes you are working with (see 
<a href="li_onion.html"><b>Onions</b></a> for details). When buying 
onions always press on the top right by the stem. If the onion is not 
firm there, it is starting to decay inside. Onions that have started to 
sprout should be discarded as the central layers will be depleted.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Yellow storage onions (the most common type) 
last around a month stored in cool dark place with good air circulation 
- a bin or mesh bag. Red and White onions will usually keep almost as 
long, but Sweet onions are much more perishable, figure on just a couple 
of weeks at best.<p></p>
<h3>Cut Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Unused peeled and cut (but not sliced or 
chopped) onions can be kept in the fridge in a plastic bag for several 
days, but beyond that they are subject to mold and other forms of 
degradation.
<p></p>

<h2 id="cut" class=lrg>Peeling, Cutting <small>&amp;</small> Chopping Onions</h2>

<img src="../ke/img/kn_santo01d.jpg" alt="Santoku Knife" class=mrg></a>
<h2>Tears</h2>
<br>This is the big problem with cutting onions. When damaged, the cells 
of Onions release enzymes which combine with sulphur compounds to produce 
propanethiol S-oxide vapors. When these reach the moisture in your eyes 
they form Sulphuric Acid, which stings, causing increase in tear 
production to wash it away. Some onions are much worse than others, it 
depends on how much sulphur was in the soil they grew in. There are 
various techniques for reducing this effect, some practical, some not.
<br class=cll>
<ul>
<li><h3>Knife:</h3> &nbsp; It is very important to use a very thin, 
  razor   sharp knife to minimize damage to the onion cells. A thin 
  <a href="../ke/kn_vegz.html">Santoku</a> (shown above) is ideal - 
  better than a Nakiri because it has a point, which makes it possible 
  to accurately prepare an onion for chopping (see below). You should 
  have one anyway because it is the premier vegetable slicing knife - 
  and it doesn't have to be endorsed by a celebrity chef and cost $200. 
  For details on keeping it sharp see our <a href="../ke/kn_sharp.html">
  Sharpening Knives</a> page. With care you should need only to use a 
  "fine" stone.</li>
<li><h3>Standing:</h3> &nbsp; When cutting onions, keep your eyes as 
  far from the cutting as possible.</li>
<li><h3>Clean:</h3> &nbsp; Remove all onion debris and cut onion from in 
  front of you right away and wipe the cutting board with a sponge now 
  and then.</li>
<li><h3>Fan:</h3> &nbsp; Blowing the vapors away from you is certainly 
  effective.</li>
<li><h3>Swim Goggles:</h3> &nbsp; This will certainly work. Some chefs 
  report using a full snorkel mask when they cut a lot of onions.</li>
<li><h3>Refrigerate:</h3> &nbsp; Cooling the onions slows the enzymes 
  that cause the problem. Unfortunately, it requires an improbable degree 
  of planning ahead - I certainly don't do it.</li>
<li><h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; Many sources suggest cutting onions under 
  water. That would certainly work, but I have failed to think of any 
  way that can actually be done, and especially done safely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Peeling <small>&amp;</small> Cutting</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>Rings:</h3> &nbsp; If you need full rings, it is best to use 
  sweet onions, particularly ones of a flattened shape because they 
  provide the best yield. Just cut off some a the stem end, peel the 
  dry and semi-dry layers over the root end to use as a handle. Slice 
  crosswise, usually about 1/4 inch wide.</li>
<li><h3>Unless</h3> you are cutting full onion rings, which I very rarely 
  do, first cut the Onion in half lengthwise. This makes it very easy to 
  work with, and also you find immediately if your onion has internal 
  problems.</li>
<li>Place onion on your board, cut side down, and cut off a little at 
  the stem end. <b>NEVER</b> cut off the root end - you need it to hold 
  everything together.</li>
<li><h3>Peeling:</h3> &nbsp; Pull back the dry and semi-dry layers over 
  the root end. Some people leave them on as a handle, but I usually 
  don't. Generally, you peel off the minimum, because the outer layers 
  are the most nutritious - but - <b>IF</b> you will be frying until 
  golden, or especially darker, you may have to peel an extra layer 
  so all your onion has the same water content.</li>
<li><h3>Slicing:</h3> &nbsp; The Onion is now ready to slice crosswise 
  as thick as you want. I usually want quarter slices, easier to 
  handle in cooking than half slices, and much easier than rings. To 
  do this I make one cut lengthwise down the center to near, but 
  <u>not through</u> the root end. Then just slice crosswise using the 
  root end to hold on to when you get near it.</li>
<li><h3>Chopping:</h3> &nbsp; Make lengthwise slices as in the first 
  photo to the right - almost to the root end but <u>not through</u> it. 
  Make them very close together for chopping fine, less close for 
  chopping small or medium, and quite wide for "dice". Tilt the knife 
  at an angle to cut inward for cuts on the sides, and be careful not to 
  cut all the way so the onion stays together. Again, a very thin, razor 
  sharp knife is essential - note that the cuts barely show in the 
  photo.</li>
<li>Now slice crosswise, holding the onion from the sides and moving 
  your fingers back as you slice, until you get near the root end, then 
  hold by the root end. Slice very thin for chopping fine, not so thin 
  for small or medium and wide for dice. The second photo to the right 
  shows the result. This is usually all the chopping the onion will need. 
  Of course, it won't pile up neatly as in the photo.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that some writers say to make one or more horizontal cuts 
through the onion. I find this dangerous, and entirely unneeded if you 
tilt the knife to cut inward as you work the sides.</p>

<h2>Disarming Chopped <small>or</small> Sliced Onions</h2>
<p>Particularly for use as a condiment, you may wish to tame chopped 
or sliced onions. There are two methods. First is to soak them in cold 
water for 20 minutes or so, then drain completely. The other is to give 
them a quick dip in rapidly boiling water, then quench in cold water 
and drain.</p>


<p><br></p>

<h2 id="fry" class=lrg>Frying Onions</h2>

<p>Frying is by far the most common method of preparing onions for a 
recipe. Frying onions takes close attention, because if you screw them 
up, the recipe is doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Most commonly, onions are fried until "translucent", at which stage 
they've lost their harsh bite and are somewhat soft - but before 
there is any browning. "Golden" is the next most common level, then 
"browned", and "dark browned", the least common and most difficult. 
Even a small amount of burning will impart a bitter taste to the recipe.
Of course, a former girlfriend from Texas preferred a modest amount of 
burning because that's how her mother used to make them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Peel, slice, dice or chop as appropriate for the recipe. If you 
will be frying beyond "light golden", be sure you have peeled deep 
enough that all the onion has the same moisture content.</li>
<li>Select a pan that is quite a bit larger than the burner, usually 
a multi-ply saut&eacute; pan or deep skillet. 2 quart and 3-1/2 quart 
saut&eacute; pans should be full wrap-around multi-ply because slab 
bottomed will have a very hot ring at the edge of the slab. This makes 
control of even browning difficult. A 5-1/2 quart is so much bigger 
than the burner that a slab bottom pan works fine (and is much more 
affordable). For details see our <a href="../ke/kp_sstl.html">
<b>Stainless Steel &amp; Multi-Ply</b></a> page. Cast Iron cookware 
doesn't have so much of this problem and fries more evenly.</li>
<li>Use the amount of oil specified in the recipe. It doesn't need to 
be a lot, but 1 Tablespoon is about minimum for a 3-1/2 quart 
saut&eacute;. More oil makes for easier control.</li>
<li>A light sprinkle of <b>Salt</b> will help the onions fry evenly.</li>
<li>Start on fairly high heat, and stir very often, turning away from 
the pan for only very short times, but don't stir continuously, let the 
onions rest a little between stirrings. In particular move onions at 
the edges toward the center, and vice versa, and scrape down the sides 
as onions stuck there will darken very rapidly. As the onions fry, keep 
turning the heat down. Once they start to color they should be on rather 
modest heat.</li>
<li>For darker browning, you need very low heat and a lot of attention, 
because any burning can seriously affect your recipe results.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Very Even Medium <small>or</small> Dark Browning</h2>

<p>This is particularly important for Onions or Shallots that are used 
as a garnish. This technique will also make it easy to fry onions very 
dark without so much risk of some burning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Peel the onion deep enough so all layers have the same moisture 
  content.</li>
<li>Slice or chop the onions to the size desired. Remember that the 
  onion pieces will shrink quite a lot. Keep the size as uniform as 
  possible.</li>
<li>Spread them out on a hard surface to dry. Turn them now and then 
  for even drying. About 6 hours will do.</li>
<li>Fry them in fairly shallow oil, over rather low heat, stirring very 
  often but not continuously.</li>
<li>If your recipe calls for them to be crisp, don't try to fry them 
  crisp, they should still be a bit flexible. They will crisp up as they 
  cool.</li>
<li>Drain on paper toweling.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="pearl" class=lrg>Pearl Onions <small>&amp;</small> 
Boiling Onions</h2>

<p>Handling these like full size onions would be very tedious. They are 
almost always used whole. Commercial pearl onions aren't actually real 
pearl onions (see <a href="li_onion.html#pearl">Pearl Onions</a>), 
they're selected regular onion types grown under crowded conditions to 
keep them very small.</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a rolling boil.</li>
<li>Pour Onions into the boiling water over high heat. Don't overload 
  the pan. Leave for about one minute, then fish them out and quench 
  under cold water (easiest to toss them in a big bowl of cold water 
  with the faucet running into it).</li>
<li>With a razor sharp knife, cut a little off the stem end. Then peel 
  the paper layers back over the root end.</li>
<li>Cut off the absolute minimum from the root end - it's what holds 
  the onions together while cooking.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="oven" class=lrg>Oven Roasting Onions</h2>

<p>Onions may be oven roasted: 
<ul>
<li>whole unpeeled</li>
<li>halved crosswise unpeeled and dressed on the cut side</li>
<li>halved crosswise peeled and dressed on the cut side</li>
<li>Peeled and cut into wedges.</li>
</ul>
<p>For whole and half onions the oven is preheated to 
425&deg;F/220&deg;C. For wedges or small half onions, the oven is 
preheated to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</p>
<p>Onions to be roasted are usually tumbled with some Olive Oil. Half 
onions are usually painted with Olive Oil on the cut side and often 
dressed with herbs or spices. Wedges are usually tumbled with an oil 
base dressing.</p>
<p>Onions can be placed on a baking sheet, oiled or not, but for easy 
clean-up, the sheet can be covered with foil, oiled or not. Roasting 
time will be about an hour for whole onions, depending on size. They are 
done when a sharp skewer finds them soft all the way through. Halved 
onions are usually roasted until lightly browned on the cut side.</p>
<p>Whole onions are often sliced in half after baking. Slice them 
lengthwise, not crosswise, with a very sharp thin knife.</p>
<p>Finished roasted onions are often dressed with balsamic vinegar or 
wine vinegar and olive oil, and perhaps a touch of salt. Herbs are also 
sometimes included.</p>
