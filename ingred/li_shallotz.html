Shallots, probably originating in Central Asia, have a multi-bulb 
form similar garlic but with fewer, larger bulbs. Sliced they 
appear similar to a small red onion. Their flavor is similar to red 
onion with a touch of garlic blended in. They are sharp with "tear 
power" that can make an onion cry.</p>
<p>Shallots have been a "gourmet" item in the U.S. and were mostly 
imported from France and sold at around 2004 US $6.99 / pound, but 
this has been changing. In California (where large quantities are now 
grown), produce markets have them for as low as 2014 US $1.99 (though 
you can still pay a lot more in supermarkets and gourmet outlets). 
This has been brought about by the large and growing Indian and 
Southeast Asian populations here. Shallots are much used every day 
items in those regions. In India, shallots are much used in the south, 
but little distinction is made there between shallots and red onions, 
which are probably smaller there than they are in North America.</p>

<h2 id="bana">Banana Shallot</h2>

[&Eacute;chalion (France); <i>Allium cepa</i> var. <i>aggregatum</i>]
<p>These are primarily grown in France, but also used in England. The 
specimens in the photo to the left were grown in France, and were 
typically 4-3/4 inches long and 1-1/8 diameter.	I have seen them only 
once in the stores where I shop, but they may be more available in 
markets targeting the yuppie demographic.</p>
<p>A writer of authentic Singapore recipes, who is based in London, calls for 
Banana Shallots" in all her recipes, though the small Asian shallots are 
probably what is used in Singapore. This indicates she considers texture and 
taste are suitably equivalent, and the larger size convenient.

<p>These shallots are found wild from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan. They are 
cultivated in France, but are not native there. Some are grown by 
specialty growers in North America, particularly by growers of exotic 
garlics. While French chefs swear by them, most people don't notice 
much difference, except they are more of a hassle to peel. They are 
tear shaped and small, about 1-1/2 x 1 inches.

[Moo-Seer (Persia); <i>Allium stipitatum</i>, <i>A. hirtifolium</i> 
(possibly same species)]
<p>These shallots are found wild from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan, but are not 
found in our markets. Some are cultivated, but most are gathered wild in 
the mountains of Iran, sliced and dried before selling in the marketplaces.
</p>
<p>In Iran, the dried slices are often soaked in water for several days, 
then boiled to make them milder. They are then often crushed and used to 
flavor yogurt. Extracts of the plant are highly anti-bacterial, and are 
used in treatment of several diseases throughout their range.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The most common varieties available in 
California are the large, often somewhat elongated, European style and 
the small round Asian variety, depending on which ethnic communities 
the market serves. Both are shown in the photo. The typical European 
shallot is 2-1/2 inches long, 1-1/2 inches across and weighs 1.3 ounces. 
The typical Asian shallot is about 1-1/4 inch long. 1-1/4 inches 
diameter and weighs 1/2 ounce.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Kept in a cool dry place with good air 
circulation (mesh bag) shallots will keep as long as a month. 
Eventually they dry out to the point they are soft.<p></p>

<h3>Usage:</h3> &nbsp; While red onions can replace shallots in some recipes, 
they have one attribute that makes them essential for other recipes - they 
dissolve completely into sauces, which onions will not do, even if chopped 
to equal fineness.<p></p>

<p>What does a recipe mean when it says "One Shallot"? Here's my best 
estimate based on the shallots available in areas of Southern California 
that serve particular shallot using communities:</p>
<table>
   <tr><td><b>1-1/4 ounce &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></td><td>
   European, American, Near and Middle Eastern recipes.</td></tr>
   <tr><td><b>1/2 ounce</b></td><td>Indian and Southeast 
     Asian recipes.</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>The way I interpret "1 shallot" is: if the bulbs are separate or 
wrapped together only with dried skin, each bulb is a shallot. If two 
bulbs are wrapped together under a layer that's fully living, they count 
as one shallot. Thus in the photo above, the European at the top and the 
Asian at bottom left both count as two shallots while the Asian at 
bottom center would be one shallot.</p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Shallots are usually thinly sliced into rings or 
chopped fairly fine.
<ol>
<li>Select a very thin razor sharp knife like a Santoku.</li>
<li>Cut off the tip at the stem end, <u>leaving the root end attached</u>.
  </li>
<li>If the shallot will be chopped, slice in half lengthwise and 
  peel the dried skin back over the root end. If it will be sliced into 
  rings, just peel the dried skin back over the root end.</li>
<li>If chopping, set the half shallot down on the flat side. Holding by 
  the root end, make lengthwise cuts down to but not through the root 
  end, tilting the knife a bit to come in from the sides.</li>
<li>Slice thin crosswise holding by the root end. Discard the root 
  end. If you made your cuts close together, no further chopping should 
  be needed.</li>
  </ol>
