<p>Yuccas (Genus <i>Yucca</i> &amp; <i>Hesperoyucca</i>) are plants 
native to relatively arid regions of North America, Mexico, Central and 
South America and the Caribbean. In central North America They can be 
found as far north as Alberta, Canada. They are characterized by long, 
tough, sword-like leaves and and tall stalks of white or light colored 
flowers (when in season).</p>
<p>The name is confusing due to confusion on the part of Carl Linnaeus 
(father of modern taxonomy). The Yucca roots sold in the market are from 
Cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i>), not this Yucca, the roots of which 
are not used for food.	Yuca was a Taino word for cassava in th Caribbean.

There are many species and varieties of yucca, but none are particularly 
toxic. The photo to the left shows one of the kind very common here in 
Southern California. This one is about 8 feet to the top of the flower 
stalk. They are in bloom during the late spring and early summer.</p>

<p>The edible parts are the flowers, fruit, seeds and young flower 
stalks, well before the flower stems start to unfold. After that they 
are quite woody.</p>

<p>Yuccas, like Agaves and Sotols, contain bitter saponins (soap) which 
causes them to be bitter, some more bitter than others. The least bitter 
part is the flower petals, but even so, most are unpleasant eaten raw. 
Boiling in plenty of water is indicated for bitter parts, as the 
saponins get leached out and discarded with the water.</p>

<p>Flower petals taste somewhat like artichoke, but a little more bitter. 
Once blanched in boiling water they can be used in potato salads or as 
a side dish dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. They 
are also often used in omelets. The reproductive parts of the flower are 
best discarded, or given a long boil for some other use, as they are 
quite bitter.</p>

<p>Young fruit can be roasted or boiled until the pulp inside is tender. 
Scrape it out and strain out the seeds. Sweetened, this pulp can be 
used as a pie filling.</p>

<p>Seeds are best roasted at 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. Then grind them 
coarsely and boil as a vegetable.</p>

<p>Young flower stalks, cut long before they start to bloom, can be 
cut into segments and boiled for 30 minutes in plenty of water. You can 
peel them before or after boiling.

As you can see from the photos, yucca blooms very unevenly, so to 
harvest flowers you have to gather from several plants each day, and 
revisit them all several times. They bloom from the bottom of the 
flower head upward, and each stem from the base to the tip. Notice 
that there is a young fruit midway down the stem, so you could be 
harvesting both flowers and fruit on the same pass.

  Palm Tree Yucca; Izote de Desierto (Spanish "desert dagger"); 
	<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>]
<br><img src="img/li_yuccj01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
</p><p>
These Yuccas grow in desert regions in California, Nevada, Arizona and 
just a touch into the southwest corner of Utah. They can grow to 49 feet 
and can live for thousands of years. There is considerable concern that 
these yuccas will be severely damaged by global warming, and that they 
will not be able to migrate to follow the climate because the giant 
Shasta ground sloths that formerly spread their seeds are extinct.</p>
<p>These yuccas were very important to Indians native to the region,  
for many uses, including gathering seeds and flower buds for food. The 
fruits are quite large, about 6 inches long.	Today, you don't want to 
mess with these trees as they are protected by law in the states where 
they grow.

<i>Hesperoyucca</i> were recently broken off from <i>Yucca</i> due to 
some morphological differences. Of the two species, <i>H. wipplei</i> 
is the important one. Native to Southern California and Baja California, 
Mexico, their leaves average around 3 feet long and their flower stalks 
can reach 10 feet tall. It can take 5 or more years to mature and flower, 
and, unlike most yuccas, will die after flowering, to be succeeded by 
small offshoots growing around the base.</p>
<p>These yuccas were very important to Indians native to the region,  
for many uses. including food. Young flowers are edible, but tend to be 
bitter. They are sometimes boiled in three changes of water to make them 
more edible. Young seed pods are large and can be eaten raw, cooked or 
pounded into meal. Seeds can be roasted and eaten whole or pounded into 
flour. The flower stalk is edible if cut very young and not starting to 
flower.
