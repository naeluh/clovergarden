<h1>Avocados</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Avocado tree is the only member of the Laurel family 
(<i>Lauraceae</i> that's a significant food producer. Its fruit, the 
Avocado, is also known as Alligator Pear and Midshipman's Butter. Avocado 
and the Spanish aguacate are derived from the Aztec <i>ahuacatl</i>.</p>

<p>Native to tropical and temperate America, this tree is a bit of a 
mystery. The fruit is very large with a large seed, and rather than 
storing energy as sugar, it stores in the more concentrated form of oil, 
which takes a lot of energy to do. Clearly the avocado co-evolved with 
some very large animal with high energy needs but that animal is now 
unknown. What is known is that people and jaguars love avocados.</p>

<h2 class=lrg id=avo>Avocado</h2>
<br>[<i>Persea americana</i>]
<p></p>

<h2>Avocado Types</h2>
<p>Botanists divide avocados into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Mexican:</h3> grow well in arid climates and can stand coldish 
  winters. They are of smaller size with much higher oil content (15% to 
  30%), more flavor than West Indian varieties and smooth or warty green 
  skins. They are suitable for guacamole and other Southwest and Central 
  American recipes.</li>
<li><h3>Guatemalan:</h3> Similar to Mexican varieties in oil content and 
  flavor, these avocados are of moderate size and generally have a rough 
  woody and somewhat loose skin. They are compatible with the California 
  climate but not that of Florida.</li>
<li><h3>Florida:</h3> &nbsp; [West Indian] &nbsp; Most are of large size 
  and have smooth skins. They have about half or less the oil content of 
  Mexican / Guatemalan varieties (3% to 15%), and the flesh is more 
  watery and less flavor intense. They are not recommended for guacamole 
  or other Southwest dishes but are fine for Avocado dip (which includes 
  mayonnaise and/or sour cream, while guacamole <u>does</u> <u>not</u>). 
  They work well for West Indian recipes and those of the American South, 
  as well as Philippine and other Tropical cuisines.</li>
<li><h3>Hybrid:</h3> Most commercial avocados today are hybrids, West 
  Indian with some Guatemalan in Florida and various mixes of Mexican 
  and Guatemalan in California.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Growing Regions</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>California</h3> produces 80% or the avocados sold in the U.S and 
  also exports to East Asia where the Hass variety has become popular. 
  Varieties grown in the state are of Mexican and Guatemalan extraction, 
  small but high in oil and flavor. California avocados are available year 
  round, and because they do not ripen until harvested they are warehoused 
  right on the tree.</li>
<li><b>Florida</b> produces a bit less than 20% of avocados sold in the 
  U.S. They are all West Indian varieties with some hybridization with 
  Guatemalan, but with West Indian characteristics predominating. They are 
  more perishable than the California varieties so are not shipped as 
  widely. They cannot be warehoused on the trees due to hurricanes.</li>
<li><h3>Hawaii</h3> grows a significant avocado crop but mostly for local 
  consumption. Exports are limited mainly to Alaska and non-US winter 
  markets due to USDA APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) 
  requirements.</li>
<li><h3>Texas, Louisiana</h3> and other Southern states grow a few for 
  local consumption.</li>
<li><h3>Mexico</h3> is the world's largest producer of avocados with 
  315,000 acres vs. California's 74,000.</li>
<li><h3>Indonesia</h3> is now the second largest producer, just ahead of 
  the United States, but exports mainly to Southeast Asian markets. Florida 
  varieties have predominated there due to the wet tropical climate.</li>
<li><h3>Worldwide</h3> Mexican/Guatemalan avocados are now grown in 
  Israel, South Africa, New Zealand and Spain, West Indian avocados are 
  grown in humid parts of South America.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="buy">Buying, Storing <small>&amp;</small> Using Avocados</h2>

<p>Unlike other fruits, the avocado will not soften on the tree. 
California avocados are "warehoused" by just leaving them on the tree 
until needed. When picked they are fully mature but will be rock hard. 
Because of this California allows sale of undamaged windfall, banned 
here for all other fruits.  Florida must sell its avocados immediately 
when ready. They can't leave them on the trees because of hurricane risk.
</p>

<p>Look for avocados that are of uniform color without black or brown 
spots or bruises. When you buy them they will probably be hard and need 
to be left out on the counter for a few days until softened. To tell if 
an avocado is ready, hold it in the palm of your hand and squeeze very 
gently with your finger tips. You're looking for it to yield slightly 
but not be mushy.</p>

<p>Florida avocados are ready when you can feel them yield to gentle 
pressure, California avocados are best left for an additional day. 
Refrigeration can slow softening but not by much.</p>

<p>Once cut, avocados darken quickly from exposure to air. To fend this off 
brush the cut surface with citric acid or lemon juice, or press plastic wrap 
down on the cut to exclude all air. Alternatively just let the cut darken 
and dry. Just slice off the dark layer when ready to use.</p>


<h2 class=lrg id="var">Avocado Varieties - California</h2>

<p>The University of California lists around 120 cultivated varieties 
known in California, but listed here are only ones I've successfully 
purchased in markets.</p>

<h2>Eisenhower</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_aveisen02h.jpg" alt="Eisenhower Avocado" class=mrg>
California: I have no idea why this is not the dominant green skin 
avocado in California. This is a fairly large avocado. The photo 
specimen was 5 inches long, 3 inches diameter and weighed 11-3/4 ounces 
with a seed weighing only 1 ounce. This avocado is delicious, ripens 
evenly, contains no fiber, has a stiff skin that can be peeled easily 
or used as a cup for eating it with a spoon. It's easy to tell when its 
ripe (mottled green and black), it slices nicely, but above all, it has 
a tiny seed and a <u>huge</u> amount of flesh. The grower says they 
have one tree, but intend to graft more. Purchased at a large farmer's 
market in Pasadena, California.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="hass">Hass</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_hass1c.jpg" alt="Hass Avocado" class=mrg>
California: this smallish avocado is oval with almost no neck and has an 
excellent almost smoky flavor highly suited for guacamole and other 
Southwest and Central American recipes. It has good shelf life and 
accounts for about 80% of the California crop.The skin is hard, rough, 
and black, even purplish when ripe. An over-ripe Hass will feel hollow 
under its stiff skin. The Hass was an accident and nobody knows what 
exact varieties it is descended from, but it is mostly Guatemalan. 
Attempts to grow Hass in Hawaii failed. 5 to 12 ounces and available 
year round.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Lamb Hass</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_avlambh03h.jpg" alt="Lamb Hass Avocado inside and outside view" class=mrg>
<br>California: This new variety not yet widely distributed. It is very 
similar to regular Hass but larger and the skin is less pebbly. It is 
ripe when the skin feels just a little loose. The flesh is rich and 
creamy with no significant fiber. The skin peels easily and the flesh 
slices very well.
<p>The photo specimen was 4-1/4 inches long, 3-1/4 inches diameter and 
weighed 15-1/2 ounces. It was purchased at a farmer's market in Los 
Angeles.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Gwen</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_gwen1c.jpg" alt="Gwen Avocado" class=mrg>
California: a mostly Guatemalan variety, oval with a pebbly skin. It's 
similar to Hass in appearance but a bit larger and the skin remains dark 
green and somewhat pliable when ripe. Good flavor and makes good guacamole. 
6 to 15 ounces and available during the summer months.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Bacon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_bacon1c.jpg" alt="Bacon Avocado" class=mrg>
California: a mostly Mexican variety not as flavorful as Hass but still 
fine for guacamole and other Southwest recipes. It is pear shaped almost no 
neck. 6 to 12 ounces and available from fall through spring.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Fuerte</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_fuerte1c.jpg" alt="Fuerte Avocado" class=mrg>
California: this smooth green skinned avocado has very good flavor and 
is usable for guacamole and other Southwest recipes. It is a mostly Mexican 
variety, pear shaped with a noticeable neck and smooth medium green skin. 
This was the original California commercial variety. 5 to 14 ounces and 
available from late fall through spring.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Kona Sharwil</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_sharwi02k.jpg" alt="Sharwil Avocado, outside and inside view" class=mrg>
<br>Hawaii: a Mexican Guatemalan cross, originating from Australia, that 
dominates Hawaiian avocado production. It is the only Hawaiian grown 
avocado certified for export to some other states. This avocado has 
medium yellow flesh, good nutty flavor and ripens green.  Hawaiians 
consider it superior to Californian but little is exported to here 
because meeting California and USDA APHIS packaging and inspection 
protocols is a real pain. Sharwil Avocados are also grown to some 
extent in Australia and New Zealand.

<h2>Pinkerton</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_pinker1c.jpg" alt="Pinkerton Avocado" class=mrg>
California &amp; some Florida:  this avocado has a relatively long neck, 
thick flesh, small seed and very dark green slightly pebbly skin. A 
Guatemalan variety but not as flavorful as some other California 
varieties. 8 to 18 ounces and available in winter and early spring. When 
buying Pinkertons, check to make sure the neck is firm as some ripen 
unevenly and start to spoil from the neck.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Reed</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_avoreed02h.jpg" alt="Reed Avocado" class=mrg>
California: this large Guatemalan avocado is oval with no neck and a dark 
green, slightly pebbly skin. Most production goes to food service distribution 
rather than to stores. 8 to 22 ounces, available in summer months and 
early fall. It is ripe when it starts to show a few black spots on the outside 
and if it feels hollow it is overripe. When ripe the flesh starts to pull 
away from both the seed and the skin. Flavor is good but not as intense as 
Hass.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Susan</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_gwen1c.jpg" alt="Susan Avocado, outside and inside view" class=mrg>
California - Parentage unknown: This is a very small avocado with good 
flavor. The skin is paper thin but peelable. When ripe, the seed rattles 
and the stem end becomes black. The photo specimen was 2-3/4 inches long, 
2-1/8 inches diameter and weighted 3-1/2 ounces. The seed weighed 3/4 
ounce. Purchased at a farmer's market in Los Angeles.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Zutano</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_zutano03k.jpg" alt="Zutano Avocado" class=mrg>
California:  a pear shaped Mexican avocado with a prominent neck similar 
in shape to Fuerte but with a distinctive shiny yellow-green skin. The 
skin is smooth but very thin, some will peel easily if fully ripe but 
others will not. The skin is strong enough so the flesh can be scooped 
out. Zutanos are ripe when the skin turns black in large areas. Shallow 
dimpling in the black area is normal but it should not look shriveled. 
Zutanos range from 6 to 14 ounces but the photo specimen was 5 inches 
long and weighed 10-1/8 ounces, 7 ounces without the pit. Available 
from September through early winter.

<h2 class=lrg id="varf">Avocado Varieties - Florida / West Indies</h2>
<p></p>

<p><img src="img/ll_avohall05h.jpg" alt="Hall Avocado" class=mrg>
I have few pictures of Florida avocados because Florida growers don't ship 
to California. This state's strict regulations designed to protect crops from 
imported pests and disease make it difficult. Florida varieties are not 
grown in California because they need a much wetter environment than is 
available here - and they aren't good for guacamole (not enough oil). 
The only place I've been able to buy them is from a Philippine market 
in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock).</p>

<p>Fortunately my lack of pictures is made up for by 
<a href="http://www.tropicalfruitnursery.com/variety-viewer-variety-avocado-reference-1">
<b>Pine Island Nursery</b></a> which has a very excellent set - just 
click on their small pictures for a larger view and details.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Bernecker</h2>
<br>Florida: a popular very large sized commercial variety with high 
quality fruit and good yield. It has a smooth medium green skin and 
elongated mango shape. 24 to 40 ounces and available from August to 
October.<p></p>

<h2>Beta</h2>
<br>Florida: very popular commercially for very high yield and fairly good 
quality fruit. It has a smooth medium green skin and neckless shape. 14 to 
24 ounces and available from July to September.<p></p>

<h2>Brogdon</h2>
<br>Florida, Gulf Coast: with its smooth purple skin and elongated shape 
this avocado is easy to recognize. It is considered of very high quality 
and is grown from Florida to New Orleans. 14 to 24 ounces, available 
from September through November.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Choquette</h2>
<br>Florida: a giant size avocado with dark smooth green skin and neckless 
shape. With high quality fruit, heavy yield and large size it is becoming 
a commercial favorite. 24 to 40 ounces and available from October through 
December.<p></p>

<h2>Doni</h2>
<br>Florida: a popular commercial avocado of good quality and very large 
size. It has a smooth shiny skin and a neckless but elongated mango like 
shape. It is particularly popular because it can be fully harvested 
before the hurricane season. 24 to 32 ounces and available from May 
through June.<p></p>

<h2>Hall</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_avohall04h.jpg" alt="Hall" class=mrg>
Hall has fallen out of favor with commercial growers in favor of 
Choquette which has a longer season and higher yield but is still grown 
in some areas because its cold tolerance is superior. The photo specimen 
was 7-3/4 inches long, 3.9 inches diameter and weighed just under 29 
ounces.
<p>This avocado was cut at the peak of edibility when the smooth emerald skin 
became splotched with black and the flesh had just started pulling away from 
the skin. Eating quality and flavor of the yellow-green flesh was excellent 
and it peels almost without effort. The flesh is soft and smooth without 
fiber but firm enough to slice well and hold its shape. This specimen was 
obtained from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). Available 
October and November.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Miguel</h2>
<br>Florida: a popular commercial variety producing very large, high 
quality avocado with a smooth green skin and a neckless mango like shape. 
24 to 32 ounces, available August through September.<p></p>

<h2>Monroe</h2>
<br>Florida: a popular cold tolerant variety producing high quality fruit 
with smooth green skin and a neckless mango like shape. 16 to 24 ounces, 
available November through January.<p></p>

<h2>Russell</h2>
<br>Florida: this very large avocado is popular in the Latin communities and 
easily recognized by its extremely elongated gourd-like shape. Very good 
flavor but only moderately popular with growers due to moderate yield. 
24 to 40 ounces, available July through August.<p></p>

<h2>Simmonds</h2>
<br>Florida: a very popular early season avocado for both commercial and 
home growers. It has smooth green skin and elliptical shape. 16 to 24 ounces, 
available June through August.<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="oil" class=lrg>Avocado Oil</h2>

<h2>Avocado Oil - California</h2>
<br><img src="img/oi_avocad02h.jpg" alt="Bowl of Avocado Oil" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Persea americana</i>]
</p><p>
Avocado Oil has recently (2013) become widely available at prices 
comparable to quality Olive Oil. Olive oil has a slightly buttery taste, 
and a smoke point of 520&deg;F/270&deg;C, considerably higher than any other 
available oil. It's health profile is very similar to Olive Oil, and it 
is even more resistant to rancidity. Truly the "go-to" oil for very 
high temperature applications.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="leaf" class=lrg>Avocado Leaves</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Avocado Leaves - Mexican</h2>
<br><img src="img/ll_avoleaf01h.jpg" alt="Avocado Leaves" class=mrg>
<p>[<i>Persea americana</i> var <i>drymifolia</i>]
</p><p>
Avocado leaves are much used in parts of Mexico as a flavoring. For 
this purpose only leaves of Mexican type avocados (var <i>drymifolia</i>) 
are useful, as Guatemala and Florida varieties lack the anise-like aroma 
and flavor.</p>
<p>Avocado leaves are used both fresh and dried. Dried ones are most 
available north of the Mexican border and can be found in markets serving 
Mexican communities. Dried leaves are generally toasted on a hot dry 
comal until aromatic and are then crushed to powder. They may be used in 
soups, stews and other dishes to impart a light anise flavor.</p>
<p><b>Toxicity:</b> &nbsp; The University of California at Davis found 
that goats were sickened by eating large quantities of Guatemalan variety 
avocado leaves. This effect was not found with Mexican variety leaves. 
While it's highly unlikely that culinary quantities of any avocado leaf 
would have a detectable effect on humans, for flavor the Mexican ones 
are the ones you want anyway.
