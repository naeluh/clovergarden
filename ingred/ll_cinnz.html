<h1>Cinnamon / Cassia</h1>
<br><img src="img/ll_cinnamon01g.jpg" alt="Forms of Cinnamon and Cassia Bark" class=mrg>
<b>Cinnamon</b> - [<i>Cinnamonum verum (zeylanicum)</i>]
<br><b>Cassia</b> - [<i>Cinnamomum cassia (aromaticum)</i>]
<p>
Cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and the Malabar coast of India 
but now grown also in the West Indies and South America. Cassia is native to 
Burma and is grown in China, Vietnam and Indonesia with Vietnamese 
(<i>Cinnamomum loureiroi</i>) considered the highest quality. The 
aromatic bark of both these trees is peeled and dried for use as a spice. 
The two are easily confused but pretty much interchangeable in recipes.</p>
<p>Shown are long Cinnamon sticks (top), standard U.S. Cassia sticks (center), 
broken Cinnamon common in Indian groceries (right) and ground Cinnamon/Cassia 
(left). Preference for and availability of these spices is a mater of region. 
Cassia predominates in the U.S. but is difficult to find in Europe where 
Cinnamon predominates. China and Southeast Asia use Cassia almost 
exclusively. Cinnamon is used in India and Sri Lanka. Cinnamon generally has 
a cleaner, sweeter flavor and Cassia has a touch of bitterness.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Cassia can be found in just about any market in 
the United States that sells spices. Real cinnamon is usually easy to 
find in the section for Mexican spices and chilis. The photo to the left 
shows cross sections of Cassia (on the left), a thick Cinnamon (top 
right) and the more common (around here anyway) very thin Cinnamon bark.
<p></p>
<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; There is really no excuse for buying ground 
cinnamon which degrades rapidly, since it can easily be ground as needed 
in a whirling blade coffee grinder.  Sticks are very durable and will keep 
for a couple of years if kept away from sunlight and heat.
