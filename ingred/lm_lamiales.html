<h1>Lamiales (Order)</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>
The order <i>Lamiales</i> includes some of the most economically 
important and widely used culinary plants on Earth, particularly the Mint 
family(<i>Lamiaceae</i>), providing most of our culinary herbs, and the 
Olives (<i>Oleaceae</i>), providing both edible fruit and a range of the 
best cooking oils available. Some others are also of interest for culinary 
and  medicinal uses, and many are widely planted as decoratives. All are 
characterized by a trumpet shaped flower often with a prominent 
lower lip.</span> &nbsp; <small>Photo of <i>Justicia adhatoda</i> by

<h2>Mint Family</h2>
<br><a href="mt_mints.html">
<img src="img/mt_mint05c.jpg" alt="Leafy Mint Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Family <i>Lamiaceae</i>]
<p>
This family of mostly herbs (but some pretty big trees as well) 
provides a large number of our most essential culinary herbs, as well 
as a great number of medicinal plants.</p>
<p>The family includes Mint, Basil, Thyme, Oregano, Marjoram, 
Rosemary, Sage and many others. The family is so vast we have divided 
it up into a number of major pages. These start with the 
<a href="mt_mints.html"><b>Mint Family</b></a> and branch out from 
there.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="plant">Plantain Family</h2> 
<br><a href="lm_plantain.html">
<img src="img/lm_hebes01c.jpg" alt="Flowering Plantain Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Family <i>Plantaginaceae</i>]
<p>The Plantain family is rather obscure, but includes a fair number 
of weedy plants used locally as salad greens and potherbs. It also 
provides a commercially important substance widely used as a dietary 
supplement, and also in food processing and landscape gardening. Beyond 
that, many family members are important medicinal plants.  An herb 
popular in Vietnam and surrounding regions is also in the family, as 
well as one very decorative genus that is definitely <b>Do Not Eat!</b>
The <a href="lm_plantain.html"><b>Plantain Family</b></a> has its own 
page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sesame</h2>
<br><a href="lm_sesame.html">
<img src="img/lm_sesam06h.jpg" alt="Sesame Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Til, Gingly (India,  Hindi); Ellu (India, Dravidian); Kunjid (Persian); 
Benne (US South, Caribbean - from African); <i>Sesamum indicum</i>]
<p>
This plant, native to Africa and India, is of great culinary and 
economic importance, both for it's seeds and the oil pressed from them.
Sesame has a higher oil content than any other seed, and has been 
cultivated for oil for more than 5000 years. While huge amounts are 
grown in Burma, China, India and Africa, sesame is little grown in the 
United States due to the high labor costs involved in harvesting it. 
This important plant has its own 
<a href="lm_sesame.html"><b>Sesame & Sesame Products</b></a> page.

<h2 id="olive"><u>Olive Family</u></h2>

   <h3>Olives</h3>
   <br><a href="olives.html">
   <img src="img/ol_mix01k.jpg" alt="Mix of Olve Fruits" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Olea europaea,</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the Mediterranean basin, from Portugal all the way around to 
   Morocco, and as far east as Iran, this highly drought resistant tree 
   has been and remains critical to both cuisine and economy throughout 
   its range. It not only provides edible fruit (not edible right off 
   the tree, but after a little processing) and many of the finest 
   cooking and salad oils available anywhere. but supports an extensive 
   industry. This important tree has a major page devoted to it on this 
   site - <a href="olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a>.

   <h3>Osmanthus</h3>
   <br><img src="img/lm_osman01k.jpg" alt="Flowering Branch of Osmanthus" class=mrg>
   [Sweet Osmanthus;  Guihua (China); kinmokusei (Japan); 
   <i>Osmanthus fragrans</i>]
   <p>
   Native to East Asia, from the Himalayas east across southern China to  
   Taiwan and southern Japan. Dried flowers are mixed with green or black 
   tea    to make an aromatic tea similar to how jasmine flowers are used. 
   It is    also made into a jam-like sauce that is used to perk up bland 
   porridges, soups and cakes, and used in at least one liquor. 
   Flower colors range from white through yellow to orange.

   [Arabian Jasmine;  Mo Li Hua (China);  Full (Arabic); Ful (Turkish); 
   Malila (Thai); Hoa Nh&agrave;i (Viet); <i>Jasminum sambac</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South and Southeast Asia, this is the variety of jasmine 
   used in China to make jasmine tea. Dried flowers are mixed with green 
   or black tea. The flowers, which have a very strong perfume, open at 
   night and close in the morning.</p>
   <p>The leaves of one other jasmine, <i>J. subtriplinerve</i>, are 
   used to make a beverage in Vietnam.

   <br><img src="img/lm_ash01k.jpg" alt="Leves and Seeds of Ash Tree" class=mrg>
   [Manna Ash, Flowering Ash; <i>Fraxinus ornus</i>]
   <p>
   Ash trees are generally noted for useful wood, not for any culinary 
   use, but one species, native to southern Europe has been, and may 
   still be, tapped for its sweet sap. That one is also noted for its 
   large display of flowers, inconspicuous in most ash trees.</p>
   <p>The photo is not of that species, but one of my trees (species 
   not identified), which, unfortunately, has neither showy flowers 
   nor sweet sap, and is noteworthy mainly for the huge number of baby 
   ash trees produced by its single winged seeds.

<h2 id="verbin"><u>Verbenas</u></h2>
<br> [family <i>Verbenaceae</i>]  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  This family was once 
much larger, but the AGP genome program has stripped off more than half 
the genera once assigned to this family, assigning many of them to the 
Mint family. The Verbena family now contains only a few plants of 
culinary interest.<p></p>

   <h3 id="lemv">Lemon Verbena</h3>
   <br><img src="img/vb_verblem02c.jpg" alt="Growing Lemon Verbena Plant" class=mrg>
   [Lemon Beebush; <i>Aloysia citrodora</i>]
   <p>
   Native to southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina, this aromatic 
   plant is used both for teas, and to provide a lemony flavor for fish 
   and chicken dishes, as well as marinades, salads, yogurt and 
   beverages. 	It is also used as a medicinal plant and has a significant 
   array of antioxidants.</p>
   <p>It is not much sold commercially, but It grows easily in the garden. 
   It is not, however, a good decorative because it quickly becomes 
   very rangy with sparsely leaved stems. The photo specimen is still 
   very young and hasn't ranged out yet.

   <h3>Koseret</h3> 
   <br><a href="vb_koseretz.html">
   <img src="img/vb_koseret02h.jpg" alt="Dried Koseret" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Lippia abyssinica</i>]
   <p>Native to Ethiopia, this shrubby herb (to 7 feet tall) is now grown 
   all over tropical Africa. It is used mainly as a flavoring spice and for 
   preserving butter and oil in Ethiopia, but used as a tea and as a potherb 
   in other parts of Africa.

   <img src="img/vb_mexoreg03h.jpg" alt="Dried Leaves of Mexican Oregano" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Lippia graveolens</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub, native to the US Southwest, through Mexico and as far 
   south as Nicaragua, is an important culinary herb in the cuisines 
   of Mexico and Central America. It is also used in the US Southwest, 
   but is still a bit difficult to find here in Los Angeles.</p>
   <p>Some related herbs, particularly <i>Lippia alba</i> (White Lippia) 
   and <i>Lippia palmeri</i> are similarly used.

   <h3 id="rica">Rica Rica</h3>
   <br><img src="img/vb_ricarica02h.jpg" alt="Rica Rica Herb, dried" class=mrg>
   [Moldenke; <i>Acantholippia deserticola</i>]
   <p>This herb is popular in Chile, and nowhere else, as it grows only in the 
   deserts of Northern Chile. It is gathered in the wild, but is not 
   threatened because it is the dominant desert scrub - there are many square 
   miles of it. It is usually sold dried and in a finely granular form. The 
   photo specimen is 1/2 teaspoon, so considerably magnified. The flavor is 
   similar to a mix of dried mint and dried rosemary. Because of it's use in 
   the famous Pisco Cocktail, it is easily available on-line in North Ameica.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Lantana</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/vb_lantan01c.jpg" alt="Flowers, Berries of Lantana" class=mrg>
   [Spanish Flag, Shrub Verbena; <i>Lantana camara</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub, native to the tropical Americas, has become a very 
   popular decorative here in Southern California. In some other areas, 
   particularly Hawaii, Florida and Australia, it has become a troublesome 
   weed. The foliage is toxic to most animals and eaten safely only by 
   Australian swamp wallabys, making the plant difficult to control.</p>
   <p>The berries are edible when ripe, when they are a dark metallic 
   purple, but are just mildly sweet, aren't strongly flavored and have 
   big seeds, so they're not something to seek out. I sometimes 
   eat some when I walk down to the Bank of America branch because they 
   are planted as a hedge by the neighboring condos.
   Leaf extracts are used medicinally, primarily for treating stomach 
   ulcers, and have some anti-bacterial value.

[Candlestick Tree; Palo de Velas, Arbol de vela (Spanish); 
<i>Parmentiera cereifera</i> of family <i>Bignoniaceae</i>]<p>
This tree, growing to 25 feet high, is native only to Panama, and is 
considered endangered there due to logging. It is popular in botanical 
gardens and is cultivated to some extent in Florida. The flowers 
and fruit sprout directly from the trunks and large limbs, rather than 
from smaller branches. The fruit, said to taste like bell pepper and 
sugar cane, is fleshy but fibrous, so is often used to make pickles and 
preserves rather than eaten fresh. The fruit can be up to 24 inches 
long, and is greenish yellow when ripe.

[Guajilote; Cucumber Tree; <i>Parmentiera aculeata</i> syn. 
<i>Parmentiera edulis</i> of family <i>Bignoniaceae</i>]
<p>
This tree, growing to 32 feet high, is native to southern Mexico and 
south to Costa Rica. It is now an invasive in Queensland Australia. 
The flowers and fruit sprout directly from the trunks and large limbs, 
rather than from smaller branches. The fruit, said to taste like sugar 
cane, is fleshy but fibrous, so is often used to make jams rather than 
eaten fresh. It is also cooked stuffed with meat. The fruit can be up 
to 12 inches long, but more commonly around 7 inches, and is greenish 
yellow when ripe.

<i>Ibicella lutea</i> of family <i>Martyniaceae</i>]
<p>
This plant, native to Brazil, now grows wild in Southern California 
and Florida.  It is sometimes planted as an ornamental for its showy 
flowers and weird seed pods. These are designed to hook large animals 
so as to be carried far and wide. The pod in the photo is about 2 inches 
long, not counting the horns or the stem. When the pods are young and 
green, they can be cooked similarly to okra and eaten, or made into 
pickles. &nbsp;

<h2>Morro</h2>
<br><img src="img/lm_morro06h.jpg" alt="Morro Seeds" class=mrg>
[Mexican Calabash; J&iacute;caro, Morrito; <i>Crescentia alata</i> of 
family <i>Bignoniaceae</i>]<p>
This small tree, to 26 feet, is native to southern Mexico and Central 
America as far south as Costa Rica. Flowers sprout directly from trunks 
and large branches, and produce very hard cannon ball like fruit to 4 
inches diameter. The hard shell protected the seeds so only very large 
animals, probably Gomphotheres, could eat the fruit. When they died out, 
the tree became endangered, as no other Central American animal could 
break the shells.</p>
<p>Humans showed up just in time (though they may have contributed to 
extinction of the Gompotheres), finding the shells useful and the seeds 
edible and high in protein. Young fruit is sometimes eaten or made into 
a drink, and a stable, neutral flavored oil can be squeezed from the 
seeds. When horses were re-introduced to the Americas, they learned to 
stomp on the shells to break them and eat the pulp inside. This has 
spread the seeds more widely, insuring survival of the tree. The seeds 
are heart shaped, about 0.29 inch across, 0.35 inch long and 0.07 inch 
thick (7.4 x 9.0 x 1.8 mm) with a vaguely licorice-like taste. They are 
used to make horchata, an <i>aguas frescas</i> drink. <u>Note</u>: 
"Morro" is also used as the name for seeds of the unrelated 
<a href="gd_opoz.html">Bottle Gourd</a>, also used to make horchata. 
The photo specimens were purchased from a large Hispanic market in 
Los Angeles (Burbank) for 2016 US $5.58 / pound.

<h2>Jacaranda</h2>
<br><img src="img/lm_jacar12e.jpg" alt="Large Jacaranda Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Jacaranda mimosifolia</i> of family <i>Bignoniaceae</i> (Bigonias)]
<p>
You can't actually eat Jacarandas, but they have become such a successful 
large decorative worldwide, and quite notably here in Southern California, 
they deserve a place on this page as a fine example of a large Lamiale.
This one lives just down the street from my home.  Jacarandas originated 
in Brazil.
