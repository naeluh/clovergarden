This aquatic herb is native throughout Southeast Asia, extending into 
southern China, Japan and Australia. After the Vietnam war, it was 
brought to North America by refugees, and is now easily available in 
the Asian markets here in Southern California. This plant grows well 
in still water, such as found in rice paddies. It's particularly popular 
in Vietnam, but is also used in China and Japan. In Chinese, Japanese 
and Korean, the name of this herb is the same as for 
<a href="mt_perilz.html">Perilla</a>, a very distantly related herb. It 
is made specific with a suffix meaning green leafy plant (see names 
above).</p>

<p>The flavor is unique, but has been described as a mix of citrus and 
cumin. It is also used as a medicinal plant throughout its range, and 
is often grown as an aquarium plant.</p>

<p>Most popular in Vietnam, this herb is most used in fish soups, 
especially the famous Sweet Sour Catfish Soup, but also with chicken. 
It is often present in the raw herb and vegetable platter usually 
placed in the center of a Vietnamese table, and can be used in salads. 
In Cambodia this herb is often dried for use out of season.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; A recent purchase at a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel) was a 4.8 ounce tray for 2016 US $1.80, or 
$5.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This is a rather perishable herb. Wrapped 
loosely in plastic it will keep a few days in the refrigerator. 
Altenativiely, stick it in some water as described under "Growing".
<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; This plant can be easily grown without your 
needing a rice paddy.  Take left over fronds and put them in a deep 
cup or jar of water. Tent it over with a transparent plastic bag and 
leave it for a few days to develop roots. You will probably see some 
roots already at joints. When there are sufficient roots, plant it in 
a regular pot with a mix of sand and potting soil. Again, keep it 
tented with clear plastic, with a few small holes in it to allow some 
air circulation. Keep it in part shade until it is well established. 
It should need minimal watering. Cut off flower heads when they appear, 
as it dies after flowering.<p></p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3> &nbsp; For soups and the like, the best 
substitute is a little freshly ground cumin and a bit of lime 
or lemon zest.<p></p>
