The Plantains (Family <i>Plantaginaceae</i>) are rather obscure, but 
include a fair number of weedy plants used locally as salad greens and 
potherbs. They also provide a commercially important substance widely 
used as a dietary supplement, and also in food processing and landscape 
gardening. Beyond that, many family members are important medicinal 
plants.  An herb popular in Vietnam and surrounding regions is also 
in the family, as well as one very decorative genus that is definitely

<h2>Plantains</h2>
<br>[Genus <i>Plantago</i>] &nbsp; - &nbsp; These weedy plants are found 
just about everywhere in the temperate to arctic zones of both north and 
south hemispheres. European varieties spread so rapidly through North 
America, it is reported that American Indians called them "White Man's 
Footprint". While only a few are used as food items, many have extensive 
medicinal uses.  Also, the seed husks of several species, called 
psyllium, are a major ingredient in laxatives and dietary fiber products.

   [Common Plantain; <i>Plantago major</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; also 
   Hoary Plantain; <i>Plantago media</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Europe and Central Asia, but naturalized in in much of the 
   world, this plantain is the one most used for food. Young leaves are 
   used in salads, green sauces and the like, older leaves are used in 
   stews. They are very nutritious, high in calcium and vitamins A, C and 
   K. The similar Hoary Plantain, native to Central and Western Europe, 
   is used in the same way.  &nbsp; <small>Photo of <i>P. major</i>

   <br><img src="img/lm_plantcor02e.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
   [Minutina, Erba Stella; <i>Plantago coronopus</i>]
   <p>
   Native mainly to coastal regions of Europe, Central Asia and parts of 
   North Africa, this plantain is now also found in North America, 
   New Zealand and Australia as an introduced species. This plant is 
   grown commercially on a small scale as a salad herb. In some northern 
   regions it has recently become a popular winter crop, grown in 
   unheated plastic tunnels.

   <h3>Ribwort Plantain</h3>
   <br><img src="img/lm_plantago01h.jpg" alt="Wild Plantain Plant" class=mrg>
   [Narrowleaf plantain,English plantain, Ribleaf, Lamb's tongue; 
   <i>Plantago lanceolata</i>]
   <p>This Plantain is native to temperate regions of Eurasia, but has 
   been introdued to Australia and North America, where it is very 
   widespread. The leaves are long and strongly ribbed, with three to 5 
   longitudinal ribs. The flower stalks are long and generally straight 
   up. It is often used in herbal teas and herbal medicinals, 
   particularly effective for cough. The photo specimen was found in 
   Los Angeles, California (La Crescenta).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Sea Plantain</h3>
   <br><img src="img/lm_plantmara02k.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
   [Goose Tongue; <i>Plantago maritima</i>]<p>
   This narrow leaf species is native to coastal regions in arctic to 
   temperate zones of Europe and Central Asia, and also in North and 
   South America. The leaves are up to 8-1/2 inches long, less than 1/2 
   inch wide and are less fibrous than most plantain leaves. This 
   species is found as far south as Ventura County in Southern 
   California, though it is much more common to the north.</p>
   <p>This is one of the best tasting and most edible of the plantains, 
   eaten particularly in the Maritime provinces of Eastern Canada and in 
   Alaska, where it is often canned for use in the winter. I suspect it 
   is also eaten in Finland and Siberia.

   [Chinese Plantain; Obako (Japan); Chi Qian Zi; (China); 
   <i>Plantago asiatica</i>]
   <p>
   This perennial Plantain is native to China, Korea and Japan, 
   preferring disturbed areas. It is a common culinary herb in Japan, 
   often used in soups. The flavor is slightly bitter, and the leaves 
   can be fibrous if not quite young.	It also is used medicinally for 
   a broad variety of complaints.

   [Blonde Psyllium, White Man's Footprint; Isabgol (India);
   <i>Plantago ovata</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Dark Psyllium, French 
   Psyllium; <i>Plantago psyllium</i>]
   <p>
   <i>P. ovata</i> is native to Southern and Western Asia, and is an 
   introduced species in the western United States, now naturalized. 
   It got the name "White Man's Footprint" because it started sprouting 
   up everywhere European settlers went. <i>P. ovata</i> is an annual, 
   producing a basal rosette and sending up flower spikes up to 18 
   inches high.</p>
   <p>These plants are grown commercially in Europe, India and parts of 
   the former Soviet Union, with India by far the largest producer. 
   <i>P. ovata</i> is the dominant commercial species. Psyllium seed 
   husks are very high in mucilage, making them a major source of 
   dietary fiber. This substance is used to promote regularity, 
   control diarrhea, and is an effective treatment against mild high 
   cholesterol. Psyllium must be take with adequate water as it is 
   highly absorbent.</p>
   <p>The mucilage has many other usages, including thickening ice 
   cream and other products. It has over 6 times the thickening power 
   of starch. It is also used in newly planted soil to improve water 
   retention. The seed left from milling the husk is used as chicken 
   and cattle feed.

<h2>Veronica</h2>
<br><img src="img/lm_veronic02h.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
[American Brooklime, American Speedwell; <i>Veronica americana</i>]
<p>
Native to temperate and arctic North America and Asia, this plant 
grows near streams and in moist bottomlands. It is edible and 
nutritious, tasting somewhat like watercress.  It is also medicinal, 
used mainly for bronchial congestion.  It is sometimes confused with 
members of the mint family, but its stems are round, while mints 
have square stems.

<i>Limnophila aromatica</i>]
<p>
This aquatic herb is native throughout Southeast Asia, extending into 
southern China, Japan and Australia. After the Vietnam war, it was 
brought to North America by refugees, and is now easily available in 
the Asian markets here in Southern California. This plant grows well 
in still water, such as found in rice paddies. It's particularly popular 
in Vietnam, but is also used in China and Japan. In Chinese, Japanese 
and Korean, the name of this herb is the same as for 
<a href="mt_perilz.html">Perilla</a>, a very distantly related herb. It 
is made specific with a suffix meaning green leafy plant (see names 
above).

<h2>Foxglove</h2>
<br><img src="img/lm_foxgl01k.jpg" alt="Flower Stalks" class=mrg>
[<i>Digitalis purpurea</i>]
<p>
<b>DON'T EAT THIS!</b> - It'll stop your heart - dead - and meanwhile  
the other symptoms aren't particularly pleasant. It is one of 
the most powerful medicinal herbs in the world - all parts of the 
plant contain cardiac glycoside digitoxin.
