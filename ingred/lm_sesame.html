<p>
While more <i>Sesamum</i> species are native to Africa, domestication and 
harvesting of sesame seed probably first occurred in India or Persia. 
Both seeds and oils pressed from the seeds are widely used throughout 
the world, including the seeds use on baked goods in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>Not much sesame seed is grown in the US because harvesting it is labor 
intensive. Some varieties have been developed that are mechanically 
harvestable and these are grown mostly in Texas where the climate is suitable 
for those varieties. Burma, India and China are the leading producers.</p>

<p>The photo specimens are White (left), Black (right) and freshly dry 
pan roasted white seeds (center). While raw sesame seeds have a mild seed 
flavor and just a touch of bitterness, roasting lightly takes away the 
bitterness and makes them sweet with a distinct nutty flavor, highly 
desirable as a garnish for salads and the like.</p>

<h2 id="seed">Sesame Seeds</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Black Sesame Seeds</h3> are preferred for many uses 
in East Asia, though white are also used there. Which is used is more a 
matter of appearance than flavor, though black seeds are somewhat more 
bitter.<p></p>
<h3>White Sesame Seeds</h3> are preferred in the Near East, Europe and 
the US.<p></p>
<h3>Beige Sesame Seeds</h3> also exist but are not much used.<p></p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage</h3>: &nbsp; Try to buy sesame seeds from a 
source that sells them in good volume to assure they are fresh. Korean, 
Indian, Near Eastern and Southeast Asian markets are good sources. I buy 
mine from the local Korean markets which carry white, black and toasted. 
Buy a quantity that you can use up in 6 months or so. For roasted, I 
recommend buying white sesame seeds and roasting them yourself as I have 
encountered rancidity in commercially roasted seeds and some are roasted 
too dark.. It only takes a few minutes to dry pan roast them and the 
flavor is far better. See our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>.
<p></p>

<p>Store sesame seeds in a tightly sealed jar away from light and heat. 
Rancidity is easily detected by smell and taste by anyone who has 
encountered bad peanuts. Some products of rancidity are suspected of 
being carcinogenic so consumption of rancid seeds and oils should be 
avoided.</p>

<p><u>Subst</u>: &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds can be sometimes be 
substituted by a bit of dark sesame oil but otherwise there's no 
satisfactory substitute. Fortunately sesame seeds are now easily 
available so substitution isn't much of an issue.</p>

<h2 id="oil">Sesame Oil</h2>
<p></p>
<p><img src="img/oi_sesame06h.jpg" alt="Light and Dark Sesame Oils" class=mrg>
Sesame Oil is generally unrefined and used mostly as a finishing oil 
rather than as a cooking oil, though in the past it was much used as a 
frying oil in some parts of India, now replaced by peanut oil which is 
better for the purpose.</p>

<h3>Cold Pressed Oil</h3> &nbsp; [<b>Gingelly Oil</b>] &nbsp;  Pressed 
from natural sesame seeds, this oil is widely used in the region around 
Malaysia and Singapore as an ingredient in pickles, but is also used for 
brief frying at moderate temperatures. It can be found in markets serving 
communities from southern India and Southeast Asia, or you can find it 
from health food and natural food sources at a far higher price. If a 
recipe calls for quite a bit of sesame oil and fries food in it, you 
can presume this is the oil it intends.<p></p>

<h3>Dark Sesame Oil</h3> &nbsp; This is pressed from roasted seeds and 
carries much of the nutty flavor. It is seldom used as a frying oil as it 
will quickly loose its flavor at higher temperatures. It is often added 
to stir fried dishes in the last few seconds before they are taken off 
the heat. It is also widely used in marinades and in salad dressings.
<p></p>

<p>Dark Sesame is most commonly associated with China, Japan and Korea, 
but is also used throughout Southeast Asia - and now worldwide. It is 
easily available in practically any market or supermarket that sells 
cooking oils, particularly the Japanese Kadoya brand. Asian markets will 
likely have a dozen different brands with somewhat different 
characteristics. "Sesame Oil" outside Southeast Asia generally presumes 
dark.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage</h3>: &nbsp; Sesame oil should be purchased in a 
quantity you will use up in 6 months or so after opening.  Store sesame 
oil in a tightly sealed bottle away from light and heat and with as 
little air in the bottle as practical. Under under good conditions it 
can last a year.<p></p>

<h3>Subst</h3>: &nbsp; Gingelly oil can be substituted with pure olive oil 
(not virgin) with just a tiny touch of dark sesame oil added. A little 
different and lacking the faint bitterness of Gingelly but it'll do the job.  
Dark sesame oil can be substituted by dry roasting white sesame seeds until 
golden and grinding them up with a little oil.

<h2 id="paste">Tahini - Sesame Paste</h2>
<p></p>
<p><img src="img/sp_tahini02c.jpg" alt="Dish of Tahini" class=mrg>
There are two varieties of Sesame Paste, Middle Eastern Tahini and Asian 
Paste. Tahini is made by grinding hulled sesame seeds very lightly roasted 
(no color). Asian sesame paste is made from unhulled seeds very lightly 
toasted and has a more bitter flavor. Tahini can pass in Asian recipes but 
it doesn't work the other way around.</p>

<p>Tahini is a very important ingredient in the Middle East and North 
Africa, used in dressings, soups, halva, hummus and many other dishes. 
Today it is easily available in any market serving a Middle Eastern 
community and at least one brand in most supermarkets. It should contain 
only 100% sesame seeds - no other ingredients.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage</h3>: &nbsp; Any market serving even a a small 
Near Eastern community will have this, or you can get it at a health food 
outlet at a higher price. Storage is very similar to peanut butter. It can 
be stored for a few months in a tightly closed jar in a cool place away 
from light. Some oil will separate out on top protecting the rest of the 
contents - just stir the oil back in before using. Refrigerated it will 
keep for at least a year in a tightly sealed jar.

<h2 id="hum">Hummus</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Humus (Turk)]
<p></p>
<p><img src="img/sp_hummus01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Hummus" class=mrg>
Technically this is Hummus-bi-Tahini (Chick Peas and Sesame) and legend says 
it has been made in the Middle East since antiquity - but actual evidence 
points to 18th century Damascus. Regardless of its origin it is today a 
very important preparation in the Middle East and Turkey, used as an 
appetizer and as an ingredient in many recipes.</p>
<p>The exact proportions and flavoring ingredients vary widely with region 
but it's generally made from chick peas (garbanzo beans), tahini (sesame 
paste), lemon juice, garlic, salt and olive oil. The photo specimen was 
made in Lebanon: water, dried chick peas, sesame paste, salt, citric acid.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="hal">Sesame Halva</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tahin Helvasi (Turk), 
  Halwa, Halvah, Halava, Helva, Halawa, Helwa (various)]
<p><img src="img/sp_halva03h.jpg" alt="Halva" class=mrg>
The word "halva" derives from the Arabic for "sweet" and designates a 
sweet confection variously made from various ingredients. A version made 
from Sesame paste sweetened with honey (traditional), sugar or fructose 
is very popular in Southeastern Europe, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, 
Caucasus, eastern Mediterranean, Iraq and Egypt.</p>
<p>This is a crumbly cake with a somewhat fibrous texture (more fibrous 
in honey versions) and may have pistachio nuts added and other flavorings. 
The photo specimen is plain, made in Turkey from "sesame paste, sugar, 
emulsifier, acidity regulator, nature-identical vanillin aroma", all 
listed in truly microscopic print to get in all the languages needed 
for world export.
