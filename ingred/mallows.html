<h1>Mallows &nbsp; - &nbsp; order <i>Malvales</i></h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Of the Mallows order, family <i>Malvaceae</i> provides most of the 
edible species, but there are a couple <a href="mallows.html#other">Other Families</a> 
that provide some, including one very widely used natural food coloring. 
Many mallows have medicinal value, and others are important for industrial 
materials such as Cotton, Jute, Kapok and Balsa wood. Cotton seed oil is 
a favored feedstock for manufacturing trans fats, something we'd be 
better off without. Some feel we'd be better off without Okra too, 
but they probably just don't know how to cook it. And, of course, 
particularly for the ladies, there is chocolate!

<p>
This tree is native to the tropical Americas and is used as a coloring 
and flavoring (annatto) through much of tropical North America, Central 
and South America and the Caribbean. It was taken by the Spanish to the 
Philippines where it is quite popular, and used to a much lesser extent 
in the rest of Southeast Asia and parts of India.

<h2 id="baob">Baobab</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_baobab05h.jpg" alt="Baobab Fruit cut open" class=mrg>
[Monkey Bread, Dead Rat Tree; Tabaldi (Sudan); <i>Adansonia digitata</i> 
of subfamily <i>Bombacoideae</i>]
<p>
Baobabs are one of the weirdest trees you'll ever see - often called the 
"upside down tree" because it looks planted root end up. Also called the 
"dead rat tree" since the mature fruit turns gray and looks like a rat 
hanging from its tail. The fruit ranges from spherical to cucumber shaped 
with a hard shell containing a sweet-sour pulp surrounding the seeds. 
The tree, which can be 30 feet in diameter, short or tall, is native to 
Africa but also grows in India and Australia, and as an ornamental in 
the US. Unfortunately, in Africa it is threatened by Global Warming.
</p>
<p>Leaves are eaten as greens in Africa and the trunks are sometimes 
tapped for water.  Cooking oil can be obtained by crushing the seeds, 
but it is not widely used. The fruit is the part most commonly used, 
for its sweet/tart flavor and very high vitamin C content. It is also 
high in calcium, antioxidants and dietary fiber. The pulp is eaten 
directly or as an ingredient in various drinks. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: 
Tamarind is the best substitute for the pulp. </p>
<p>As of 2015, baobab has been identified in North America as a 
"superfruit" and an industry is developing to promote it. South Africa 
is developing it as a crop to serve this industry. An interesting 
feature is that the pulp dries completely in the pod before harvest, so 
all the processor needs to do is mill it, no drying step. Initially, it 
is being used in trail mixes and nutrition bars.

<h2 id="choc">Cacao Tree</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_cocao03e.jpg" alt="Whole and split Cocao Beans" class=mrg>
[Chocolate, <i>Theobroma cacao</i>]
<p>
This important mallow is native to the deep tropical forests of 
Central and South America. It grows in the form of a small tree (up to 
26 feet tall), which produces flowers sprouting directly from the trunk 
and larger branches. These develop into pods 6 to 12 inches long, 
containing up to 60 seeds called "beans", embedded in a white pulp. 
The beans in the photo were typically 1.0 inch long, 0.57 inch wide and 
0.27 inch thick. </p>
<p>The pulp is used locally to make juice, smoothies, jellys and the 
like. The seeds are used to make Cocoa and Chocolate. Chocolate is 
considered a magical medicinal by the ladies, an effective treatment 
for PMS, depression and especially soured relationships. The split 
bean in the left center shows the crumbly, very dark brown contents 
of the bean, which tastes similar to dark bitter chocolate. These 
beans were purchased from the Central American section of a large 
Hispanic market in Los Angeles (Burbank) in a 6 ounce bag for 2016 
US $11.97 / pound.

<h2>Chinese Chestnut</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_chinacn01h.jpg" alt="Chinese Chestnut Pods and Foliage" class=mrg>
[<i>Sterculia monosperma</i>]
<p>
This tree originated in southern China and Taiwan, but is now a common 
cultivated tree in northern Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, and mountainous 
regions of Malaysia and Indonesia, parts of Burma. The thin shelled black 
seeds, one or two to an orange-red pod, are about 3/4 inch long. The 
kernel inside is yellow in color. They can be eaten raw or roasted or 
boiled in the shell, or can be shelled and used as an ingredient in 
recipes,  They are important to the Chinese "Seven Sisters" festival.

<h2>Chocolateweed</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_chocow01h.jpg" alt="Chocolateweed Flowers and Foliage" class=mrg>
[<i>Melochia corchorifolia</i>]
<p>
This herabceous plant is found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and 
Australia, as well as in the United States from  North Carolina to 
Mississippi. It likes lightly shaded places and is a common weed in 
cotton plantations, rice paddies and soybean fields. Leaves of this 
plant are used as a potherb in western and southern Africa, as well as 
India and Southeast Asia. They have a fairly high amount of protein, 
are rich in minerals, including potassium, calcium and magnesium, and 
contain a 
little oil.

<h2>Cotton</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_cotton04h.jpg" alt="Ripe open Cotton Boles" class=mrg>
[<i>Gossypium</i> species of subtribe <i>Malvoideae</i>]
<p>
Cotton leaves are not considered suitable as food, but cotton seed oil 
is important to the food processing industry. Originally used to make 
soap, this oil is now the preferred feedstock for hydrogenation, a 
process that makes fats solid at room temperature (Crisco, etc.). See 
our <a href="oilshealth.html#trans">Oils & Health</a> article for the 
full ramifications of this process. Cotton seeds contain a mild toxin 
(gossypol) which has been used as a male contraceptive in China. We 
trust this has been removed from Crisco. "New Crisco" does not use 
partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats) but does use much safer fully 
hydrogenated fats (saturated fats).

[Red Silk-Cotton, Red Cotton Tree; <i>Bombax ceiba</i>]
<p>
This tree, probably native to Southeast Asia, can grow to nearly 200 feet 
in the tropics. It is now planted from eastern Pakistan through southern 
China and on to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia. Flower cores 
are used in northern Thailand as an essential ingredient in nam ngiao 
spicy noodle soup and kaeng khae curry. In Hong Kong. elderly people are 
sometimes seen gathering fallen flowers to dry for a kind of tea.

[Cupuacu, Cupuassu, Copoasu; <i>Theobroma grandiflorum</i>]
<p>Native to the tropical rain forests of the Amazon Basin this tree 
bears fruits about 8 inches long and weighing 2 to 4 pounds. The pulp inside 
the thick hard exocarp is very fragrant and has been described as 
"banana bubblegum". The flavor is melon-like and has long been used in juices 
and deserts. The edible part is an aril surrounding the seeds.</p>
<p>This fruit has now been "discovered" by the health food industry which 
needs a steady stream of new exotic "superfruits" to promote at high prices. 
The juice is being sold for its anti-oxidant content.</p>
<p>The seeds can be used to make a form of chocolate, but commercial 
exploitation has not yet been successful due to uneven quality of the 
seeds. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Christopher Hind distributed under license

<p>
Native to tropical Australia, this small shrub bears small sweet berries 
which were important to the indigenous people, who also used the plant 
medicinally. The fruit is 2 or 4 lobed, about 0.28 inch high and 0.47 
inch wide, and brown and somewhat hairy when ripe.

<h2>Durian</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_durian02e.jpg" alt="Durian Fruit, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Durio zibethinus</i> of subfamily <i>Helicteroideae</i>]
<p>
The fruit that "tastes like Heaven and smells like Hell". Considered 
the "King of Fruit" in Southeast Asia, the spiny 4 to 10 pound fruits 
fetch a high price. In Thailand durians that have passed through an 
elephant (undigested) are particularly prized for their perfect ripeness. 
The photo specimens, purchased in an Asian market in Los Angeles, were 
previously frozen - fresh ones are easily available but cost 5 times as 
much.</p>
<p>The Durian is divided into 5 compartments, each with a large seed 
surrounded by a creamy pale yellow pulp, the part you eat, and the part 
that stinks. A compilation of descriptions would come up with something 
like "over-ripe Limburger cheese with overtones of fermenting onions and 
rotting fish". Others say it smells like a sewer, and some say "It's 
really not that bad". All who get past the smell say it tastes wonderful.
</p>
<p>Selecting a durian is a difficult process. If a squirrel has bored 
into it it's probably good, but you should demand a discount. You should 
be able to detect an odor, but not too much. No odor means it's not ripe. 
Shaking it you should detect some movement inside, but not much. A heavy 
fruit with no movement at all means unripe. A lighter fruit with a little 
movement is what you want. A lot of movement or any cracks means it's 
overripe. Watch for worm holes in any case and don't buy wormy ones.</p>
<p><i>Caution: Durians can kill</i>. You don't want to hang around under 
durian trees as the fruit is hard and heavy and high enough to kill you 
when it falls, and durians attract tigers who may be more interested in 
meeting you than you are in meeting them.

<p>
This plant, probably originating in South Asia, is cultivated worldwide 
for many uses: rope fiber, paper, edible leaves, oil, animal feed and 
bedding, fiberboard, engineered wood and thread for fabrics. The ancient 
Egyptians used it to make the ropes and sails for their ships. It can 
grow to about 11 feet tall with stems up to 1 inch diameter. Currently 
small crops are grown in California, Texas and Louisiana, mostly for 
animal feed and bedding, but you can expect it to expand as more of its 
uses are exploited, particularly if hemp remains illegal in the US (hemp 
has similar fibrous properties but is not related).</p>

<p>The leaves are widely eaten in India, and preferred to the leaves of 
Roselle, but I haven't seen this plant here in Southern California. The 
seeds are pressed for cooking oil, which has a very similar fatty acid 
profile to Cottonseed Oil, but with more Omega 3. It is commonly called 
Gongura for culinary uses and Kenaf for industrial and fiber uses. This 
plant is closely related to the smaller, red stemmed 
<a href="mallows.html#rosel"><b>Roselle / Gongura</b></a> (<i>Hibiscus 
sabdariffa</i>), but has green stems and much different fruit pods. 
Roselle has wider culinary and medicinal usege.

<p>
Native to the tropical Americas, this mallow is now grown commercially 
in Southeast Asia, especially for the fiber from mature fruits. The trees 
also figure in production of honey, and dried flower buds are used in parts 
of India as a spice. For details see <a href="mw_mogguz.html"><b>Kapok / 
Marathi Moggu</b></a>. The bark of the tree is used medicinally. An oil can 
be pressed from the seeds for use in making soap. It can also be used as 
cooking oil, but becomes rancid very quickly. The fibers from mature pods 
have long been used as stuffing for life jackets, pillows, mattresses 
and as a substitute for down. The fiber is buoyant and water resistant 
but rather flammable.

Native to tropical Asia, this mallow is widespread in India, Southeast Asia 
and southern China. In India the fibers from the mature fruits are 
used for fabrics and pillow stuffing. The flowers, fresh or dried, and 
flower buds, fresh or dried, have various culinary uses in Burma, Thailand 
India and southern China. The tree also figures in production of honey. For

[Bissy (Caribbean); <i>Cola acuminata</i> and <i>Cola nitida</i>]
<p>
This tree, which grows to 85 feet high, is native to the rain forests of 
Africa, particularly in Zimbabwe (DR of the Congo). The sweet smelling 
pods, about 8 inches long, are tightly packed with about 12 seeds in 
white shells. The shells are broken to remove the red kernels, which 
easily split into two halves.</p>
<p>These kernels contain about 2% of a kind of 
caffeine. The seed are chewed raw, in which case they start out a little 
bitter but sweeten as they are chewed, or they can be boiled to extract 
the Cola flavor and caffeine which are used to flavor some beverages. 
Of course, Coca-Cola, which originally contained both cocaine and cola, 
now contains neither, and other commercial "cola" drinks also contain 
no cola.

[Lime Tree, Basswood;  <i>Tilia cordata</i> <i>T. platyphyllos</i> 
(Europe); <i>Tilia americana</i> (North America)]
<p>
Native to Europe, Western Asia and Northeastern North America, this tree 
can grow to over 100 feet tall. Young leaves are eaten as a green, but the 
main uses for this tree are medicinal. The tea promotes sweating and is 
used for fevers, also for colds and other respiratory problems. It is 
also held effective for relieving anxiety. Wood and bark are also used 
medicinally.</p>
<p>Linden flowers are very aromatic. They are dried for use in making 
therapeutic teas. While the normal leaves of the linden are broad and heart 
shaped, the flowers and fruit are associated with long, narrow leaves called 
"bracts". These are usually included with the dried blossoms 
in commercial packaging.

<p>
This common weed grows just about everywhere in North America in the 
Spring. The leaves are edible and can be used in salads. Green seed 
wheels are also edible and often picked and eaten by children. The seed 
wheels resemble tiny wheels of cheese, hence the name "cheese plant".

<p>
The dried fruits of this tree, native to Southeast Asia and China, are 
boiled, at which they foam up to about 8 times their previous volume. The 
seeds are then removed and the gelatinous mass is used in various cold drinks 
(in Southeast Asia) and cold soups and tea (in China). In Vietnam, Thailand and 
Cambodia the drinks often also contain basil seeds, which also expand greatly 
when boiled. The photo shows a dried fruit (bottom left) a seed (top right) 
and two expanded fruits with seeds removed. Dried fruits are about 1 
inch long by 0.6 inch diameter while expanded size may vary.</p>
<p>These seeds also have significant medicinal properties. It is recommended 
never to boil more than three seeds per drink as over-consumption may result 
in watery phlegm, nausea, coughing and swollen tongue..

<h2>Marshmallow</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_marsh1c.jpg" alt="Illustrationm of Marshmallow" class=mrg>

<p>
Probably native to Africa, this herb is used as food and as a medicinal 
plant through Europe, Anatolia and Caucasus. Extract from the roots 
was once used to make the confection that still bears its name. It is 
closely related to the Common Mallow which is sometimes mistaken for it 
but the Marshmallow leaf shape is pointier and the mucilaginous 
properties are much stronger. The leaves are edible.

food the plant is picked young and cooked as greens. As the most 
important green in Egyptian cooking it's available frozen in stores 
serving Middle Eastern communities and in season fresh in Southern 
California, sold as "Okra Leaf". In Egypt leaves are also dried (they 
are thin and dry quickly) and are crumbled into a powder for use.</p>

<p>The leaves are quite mucilaginous when cooked. Most Americans would 
consider them "slimy", but in the Middle East the effect is much liked.
They are high in betacarotene, iron, calcium, vitamin C and antioxidants.

<p>
These plants can be found in a vast number of Chinese businesses and for 
sale in practically any market serving a Chinese community, usually 
several plants with their trunks braided together. They are supposed to 
bring good financial luck. Allowed to grow large (and I'm sure they would 
rather not be braided together), they produce brown fruit pods up to 12 
inches long and 2.5 inches in diameter. These contain edible seeds which 
can be eaten raw or roasted and taste similar to chestnuts. They may 
also be ground and used to make a hot beverage.</p>
<p>Note: don't try to start a plantation with plants purchased from 
Chinese markets - they are supposed to be <i>P. aquatica</i> but many, 
even most, are actually <i>P. glabra</i> which grows a thick base faster, 
but produces only 6 inch green pods with smaller seeds.

<p>
Native to India, this mallow is also found in Southeast Asia, 
including the Philippines. In the region seeds are added to coffee. Unripe 
pods, leaves and new shoots are used as a vegetable. Seeds are also used 
in the formulas of several herbal liqueurs, including Benedictine. It 
also has a number of medicinal uses, and is used for sizing in paper 
making. The flowers are sometimes used to flavor tobacco.

<i>Muntingiaceae</i>]
<p>Native to the tropical Americas and as far 
south as Bolivia, this tree is now grown in Southeast Asia and parts of 
India. The small fruits grow to a little over 1/2 inch and are very well 
liked through its range. They are very sweet and said to taste like 
cotton candy. Only in Malaysia are they harvested for commercial sale, 
everywhere else they are just foraged, mainly by children.

[Okra (US from West African); Lady's fingers (Brit); Bhindi (India); 
Gumbo (US South - from Bantu); <i>Abelmoschus esculentus</i>, formerly 
<i>Hibiscus esculentus</i> of subfamily <i>Malvoideae</i>]
<p>
Originally from Ethiopia, this mallow was carried as far as India and perhaps 
Southeast Asia by Arab traders. It spread through much of Africa and came 
to the US. with the slave trade. Okra is now grown world wide and is 
particularly important in the US South, Africa, the Middle East and India.
The photo specimens were up to 5 inches long by 1 inch in diameter, about 
as large as you'd want them.</p>
<p>In African, Middle Eastern and Southern US cooking okra is valued for 
it's mucilaginousness (sliminess) which adds body to broths and sauces, 
but in other parts of the world, India, for example, cooking methods are 
designed specifically to suppress this characteristic.</p>
<p>Okra pods are also sold dried and pickled. Okra Leaves are used in 
African cooking, but what is sold as "Okra Leaves" in Southern California 
is a different mallow, <a href="mallows.html#molok"><b>Molokhia</b></a>. Seeds from 
mature okra pods are pressed for oil in some regions and roasted seeds 
were used as a substitute for coffee for plantation slaves during the 
American Civil War. For those who fondly remember eating the seed wheels 
of <a href="mallows.html#cheese"><b>Common Mallow</b></a> as children, the taste can 
be recaptured in more convenient form by eating okra pods raw.

<img src="img/mw_kenaf04h.jpg" alt="Roselle Leaves and Pods" class=mrg></a>
[Sour Leaf,  Red Sorrel (English); Rosella (Australia, Indonesia); 
Belchanda (Nepal); Tengamora, Mwitha (Assam, India); Chukor, Gongura, 
Pulicha Keerai, Pundi, Ambadi, LalChatni, Kutrum, Mathipuli (India);

Karkade (Arabic); Sorrel (Caribbean & Latin America); Flor de Jamaica 
(Mexico); Guragod, Labug, Labog (Philippines); Bissap (Africa); 
<i>Hibiscus sabdariffa</i>]
<p>
This plant is closely related to the taller, green stemmed 
<a href="mallows.html#kenaf"><b>Gongura / Kenaf</b></a> (<i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i>) but 
Kenaf fruit pods are very different in structure. Like Kenaf, Roselle is 
primarily a fiber crop, growing to 8 feet tall, but also has a wide 
variety of culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
<p>The leaves are a very important herb or vegetable in a good part of 
India (Andhra, Karala, Karnataka, Assam and others), and valued for 
their iron content. They are used in a wide variety of pickles, dals 
and curries, particularly goat and mutton curries, but also with chicken 
and pork. They are also much used in Burma, especially with fish and 
shellfish, and in Africa, particularly Senegal, where they flavor a 
recipe for fish and rice.</p>
<p>The deep red calyx surrounding the fruit pod is also widely used. 
When dried, it is commonly known as "Jamaica" or "Hibiscus" and is 
much used worldwide for herb teas, cold drinks, jams and medicinals.
