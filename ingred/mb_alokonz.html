<p>
Despite appearances and the common English marketing name, this plant is 
in no way related to the birch tree. It is a member of the <i>Moraceae</i> 
family, the Mulberries. This large shrub is closely related to the Paper 
Mulberry, the bark fibers of which are used to make Japanese Washi paper 
and tissue.</p>

<p>While it grows all over the Philippines the male inflorescences and 
tender young leaves are only much used in the northeast (Luzon, etc.). 
Alokon is also a common non-native in Hawaii, but I don't know if anyone 
uses it for food there.</p>

<p>The photo specimens were previously frozen. In their natural state the 
inflorescences are much lighter in color (see photo below). The largest were 
about 5-1/4 inches long and about 0.275 inch diameter.</p>

<b>General:</b> &nbsp; The male inflorescences of this large shrub are 
seasonally available in the Philippines and then appear in markets in the 
northeast of the islands. They are mainly used as an ingredient in 
vegetable stews to add texture and a subtle aroma. The photo to the left 
shows what they look like on the shrub. &nbsp; <small>Photo by

<p><b>Buying &amp; Storing:</b> &nbsp; These can be found in flat plastic 
bags in the frozen food cases of markets serving Philippine communities. 
Just keep them frozen until needed.          
</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b>: &nbsp; Since they can only be had frozen in North 
America, they are already lightly cooked, so they can be added to 
vegetable stews midway through the cooking. They can be cut to more 
convenient lengths if really long, but otherwise need no preparation.
Alokon becomes somewhat mucilaginous when cooked (as it is in the frozen 
packages) and will add some body to the stew.</p>
