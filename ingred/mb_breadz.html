<p>
This is the tree Captain Bligh was transporting on the Bounty, from 
Tahiti to Jamaica to feed slaves working the sugar plantations. His crew 
decided instead to take the ship back to Tahiti for more nookie. He later 
made the voyage successfully in HMS Providence and breadfruit has been a 
major food item in the Caribbean ever since. It gets its name from a 
bread-like aroma when roasted or baked. Breadfruits grow to about 8 
inches in diameter and get up to about 10 pounds, but the photo specimen 
was about 7 inches diameter and weighed 6-1/2 pounds, </p>
<p>There are two major categories of breadfruit: seeded and seedless. The 
seedless (see photo) is the kind you are most likely to find in markets. 
The seedless hybrids were distributed across the Pacific islands in 
prehistoric times. Clearly they could not have been spread by natural 
processes, being sterile. Breadfruit are small enough to grow out at the 
end of the branches rather than from the trunk like Jackfruit.</p>
<h3>Seeded Breadfruit</h3> looks a lot like a small spherical 
<a href="mb_jackz.html"><b>Jackfruit</b></a>, inside and out, but less 
colorful. In Nigeria the seeds are used similarly to peanuts and have 
a similar flavor.

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; Breadfruit is usually picked somewhat unripe, 
when it will be very starchy. If left to ripen on the tree it will soften 
as some of the starch turns to sugar, but the fruit will then fall from 
the branch and go splat on the ground.<p></p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern 
California breadfruit is starting to get more available. In 2009 I 
could get it  only rarely from one of the Indian mrkets Indian markets 
down in Artesia. By 2017 it started occasionally appearing in a 
Philippine market in Eagle Rock. In late 2019 it started appearing 
fairly regularly in a large Asian market in San Gabriel, CA.
<p>Breadfruit is quite perishable and should be kept only a few days. 
Because it is seasonal this was a problem in tropical regions where it 
was the main staple. Pits were dug and lined with leaves, breadfruit 
flesh piled in and the pit covered. The breadfruit would ferment in the 
pit but remain edible even for years. This is not a practical solution 
for most of us.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Breadfruit may be roasted, baked, steamed, 
boiled or stir fried. In it's native range it is often roasted or baked 
whole. It is done when steam starts to escape from the stem end. It may 
then have the core cut out, be stuffed, and baked some more to absorb 
flavors from the stuffing. When done, the flesh may be scraped out of 
the shell or it may be peeled and sliced.

<p>When preparing breadfruit, keep in mind it will be exuding a sticky, 
glue-like latex. It's not quite as bad as Jackfruit, but do oil your 
knife, hands and working surface and be prepared to wash and re-oil.</p>

<p>A simple cooking method is simply to cut the breadfruit into chunks, 
discarding the core, then simmering for 30 minutes to an hour until 
tender. The rind is then cut off and the breadfruit used similarly to 
potatoes.</p>

<p>In Hawaii breadfruit is an alternate to taro for making poi. Called 
"`ulu poi". It may be made from fresh breadfruit, fermented breadfruit or 
a mixture of the two.</p>

<p>North Americans tend to prefer their breadfruit deep fried, as in the 
photo to the left. To quote L, "These are so good, French fries will be 
forever ruined for me".
