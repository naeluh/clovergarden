<h1>Figs</h1>

[<i>Ficus carica</i>]
<p>
There are at least 850 species in the genus <i>Ficus</i>, almost all 
tropical trees, shrubs and vines. Only one temperate species, the Common 
Fig (<i>F. carica</i>) is significant for food. A few others have edible 
fruit but they are used only locally as "bush food".</p>
<p>The Common Fig is the most commercially important member of the whole 
mulberry family, and a strange fruit it is. Unlike other mulberries the 
flowers are <i>inside</i> with a small hole at the end of the fruit 
through which it's only pollinator, a wasp, can enter. Each species of 
fig has its own species of wasp and can be pollinated by no other.</p>

<p>The photo specimens are Brown Turkey (2 inch diameter, 2-1/2 
ounces), Black Mission (1-1/4 inch diameter, 2 inches long, 7/8 ounce), 
and green Calimyrna (1-5/8 inch diameter, 1-1/2 inch long, 1 ounce). The 
very sweet Black Mission and Calimyrna are the two varieties most often 
found fresh in California. The Brown Turkey is larger with a tougher 
skin, but is significantly less sweet.</p>
 
<p>Trees producing edible figs come in female only, so they must be 
pollinated with pollen from a wild variety (caprifigs) the wasps live 
in. Branches from the wild caprifig trees are hung in the fig orchards 
to give the wasps easy access to the fig crop. When the wasps mature 
they enter and pollinate the edible figs. Any eggs they lay there 
promptly die because it's the wrong kind of fig. This weird method of 
cultivation seems to have been going on for at least 6000 years.</p>

<p>Some fig trees produce more than one crop a year. The early crop, 
on the previous year's wood, is called the "breba" crop and needs no 
pollination. The second, called the "main" crop forms later on the 
current year's wood, and may need pollination. There are four basic 
types of edible fig, each with multiple cultivars:</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Smyrna Type:</h3> &nbsp; These require caprifigs for pollination 
  and grow fruit on new wood. This is the main type used for dried figs 
  in Turkey and California. Examples: Calimyrna.</li>
<li><h3>Caprifigs:</h3> &nbsp; These are home to the wasps that pollinate  
  Smyrna type figs. There is one variety, Croisic, that produces edible 
  fruit with acceptable yield, particularly around San Francisco.</li>
<li><h3>San Pedro Type:</h3> &nbsp; These have a good breba crop, but the 
  main crop may be inferior, and if not pollinated will drop. This type 
  is not so popular in warmer climates, but variety Desert King is 
  popular in the Pacific Northwest for its heavy breba crop. That's the 
  only crop they'll get because the season is too short for a main crop.
  </li>
<li><h3>Common type:</h3> &nbsp; some varieties produce a good breba 
  crop and some produce little or none. They also produce one or even 
  two main crops. Neither breba or main crop requires pollination to 
  mature. This is a very popular type. Examples: Black Mission, Kadota, 
  Brunswick, Brown Turkey, Celeste.</li>

The top photo to the left is of dried Shirazi Figs, also known as Persian 
Figs and Shirazi Anjeer. They are very small at 1 inch diameter and a 
little less than 1/4 ounce. They are less sweet than the larger figs. 
Supposedly they are gathered wild in the mountains of Iran, but since 
Iranian imports are not legal in the U.S. at this time, that is not 
something I can confirm - they either are from elsewhere or have been 
"laundered" through a third country.</p>

<p>The most important Fig producing areas are Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, 
Iran and Morocco. Fresh figs are extremely perishable so about 90% of 
the crop is sold dried. Fresh figs are easily available only around the 
regions where they are grown.</p>

<p>California produces nearly the entire U.S. crop, though it's only about 
10% as large as Turkish crop. The major varieties are Black Mission (black 
or purple skin, pink inside, fresh or dried), Kadota (greenish yellow 
skin, purple inside, used for canned figs), Calimyrna (greenish yellow 
skin, pinkish brown inside) which is the favorite drying variety, Brown 
Turkey (purplish skin, pink inside) and Adriatic (light green skin, pale 
pink inside) from which fig bars and paste are made.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California fresh black and 
green figs are easily available in the multi-ethnic produce stores, 
when in season. Brown Turkey has the longest season, from mid May 
through December. Calimyrna have the shortest season, from July 
through September. Some fig growers are happy to ship fresh figs to 
less fortunate regions of North America.

<p>Dried figs are available year round in North America. Most California 
dried figs go to processors, but some are available in markets. More 
common are dried figs from Greece and Turkey. Worms used to be a big 
problem with imported figs, but I haven't seen any for many years. 
</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh figs should be used within a couple of 
days, as they are subject to mold. Storage can be extended a couple days 
in the refrigerator, loosely wrapped in paper. Dried figs should be kept 
in a tightly closed plastic bag or tray, unrefrigerated. They should be 
used within a couple months as they will get too dry and hard with 
extensive storage.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes for fresh figs originate mostly from 
the Mediterranean region, and from California. Dried figs are most often 
eaten as a snack, but they are also cooked. Most sauce or salad recipes 
require dried figs to be chopped and soaked. They are also widely used 
in baked goods, and contain a natural humectant, a chemical that keeps 
baked goods moist and extends their shelf life.<p></p>
