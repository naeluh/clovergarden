Recipes that call for cooking Jackfruit like a vegetable always 
presume you know to use Unripe Jackfruit, which is called "Raw 
Jackfruit" in most Indian recipes. Many recipes, however, just call 
for "Jackfruit" with no explanation. Whole unripe fruit is not 
common in North America, but frozen chunks suitable for curry and 
the like are fairly available.</p>
<p>Whole fruit, as in the photo to the left, has recently appeared 
(spring 2013) in some Indian markets down in Artesia. The cut example 
was actually way too mature for recipes. The seeds, though, simmered 
for  about 15 minutes, were very good, with a lightly nutty flavor 
and firm, slightly crunchy texture. The photo specimen was 6-3/4 
inches long, 5-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 2 pounds 10 ounces.

Unripe Jackfruit is used mainly for curry type dishes in India and 
Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California 
you will probably be buying your jackfruit from the frozen food cases 
of an Asian market, in which case it will look like the photo to the 
left. This is actually the best way for most uses as the product will 
be quite uniform with almost no waste. Frozen Jackfruit chunks are most 
easily available in Philippine markets, of which we have plenty here in 
Los Angeles, because our entire health care system runs on Filipino 
immigrants. This product is almost always exported from Thailand.

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; For frozen, just thaw and cut to the desired 
size. If you have a whole fresh unripe jackfruit, you'll have to peel 
it. First oil your hands and a sharp knife so the latex won't stick. 
Carve off the rind, then slice and cut to the size you want.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for simmering cut pieces of 
Jackfruit in water for 10 minutes or so to prepare them for recipes, but 
longer cooking recipes don't require that.<p></p>
