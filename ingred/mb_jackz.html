<p>
Jackfruit is probably native to the Indian subcontinent, probably the 
Western Ghats, and was carried to the Malay peninsula in ancient times. 
It has been cultivated for between 3000 and 6000 years. Today it is grown 
in almost all humid tropical lowland regions worldwide. A few are grown 
in Florida but not commercially.</p>

<p>Jackfruit come in three basic varieties. In India and Southeast Asia 
there are very large "hard" jackfruit with firm arils around the seeds, 
and smaller "soft" jackfruit with darker, sweeter and soft pulpy arils. 
In Brazil a third variety is recognized called "butter" jackfruit. Its 
arils are between the firm and soft varieties. All the jackfruit we 
get in California is the "hard" variety, grown in Mexico. Some of the 
soft jackfruit is grown in west central Mexico, but they don't ship it 
here. In the Philippines, a smaller "latex free" variety is grown, and 
sells for a premium price.</p>

<p>Jackfruit is not only the largest of the mulberries, it's the largest 
tree fruit in the world. How big they get varies by authority, but 80 
pounds and 3 feet long is a pretty safe number. Those sold in North 
America generally run between 15 and 25 pounds. The photo specimen was 
a mere 12 inches long and 9 inches diameter, weighing 18 pounds and was 
grown in Mexico.</p>

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; Jackfruit is a seasonal crop, but the season is 
long, about 6 months, and the trees are highly productive. A jackfruit 
has an inedible core extending from the stem, and a thick inedible rind, 
hard and pointy on the outside. Between the core and the rind are the 
fruit arils with their seeds They are embedded in "rags", which are 
actually unfertilized flower ovaries that didn't develop into seeds. 
Every point on the outside of the rind represents a flower.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes calling for cooking jackfruit pretty 
much always mean <a href="mb_jackrz.html"><b>Unripe Jackfruit</b></a>,
whether they say so or not, and often they do not. Asian recipe writers 
just presume you know that. To complicate things more, in India, recipes 
calling for unripe jackfruit call it "Raw Jackfruit". Unripe Jackfruit 
is often used in curries.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh whole ripe jackfruits appear in the 
markets almost all year now, here in Southern California, as they are 
now imported from major plantings in Mexico. A fully ripe jackfruit will 
have a bit of flexibility in the outer rind, a light but distinct aroma, 
and may sound a bit hollow if patted. It may have some give around the 
stem, but it shouldn't be soft. They should be quite green and have no 
evidence of cracking in the outer rind due to drying out. In season 
they are selling for 2017 US $0.99/pound in the Philippine markets, 
$0.99/2 pounds in the larger Asian and multiethnic markets, and the 
photo specimen was purchased in mid May during a one day sale for 
$0.99/3 pounds. Currently, fresh unripe jackfruit does not seem to be 
available in Southern California, but frozen is widely available.

<p>Many markets now sell Jackfruit cut into chunks, in case you can't 
commit to a 20 pound monster. Chunks are also often available in the 
frozen food cases of markets serving Southeast Asian and particularly 
Philippine communities. Frozen yellow fruit arils are also widely 
available, as well as slices of immature jackfruit (most useful for 
curry recipes).</p>

<p>Unripe jackfruit is often called "Raw Jackfruit" in recipes. Canned 
unripe jackfruit packed in brine is called for in many recipes of Asian 
origin. Though jackfruit arils packed in syrup are very common in the 
Asian markets here in Los Angeles, I haven't seen the unripe jackfruit 
packed in brine. For those recipes use a package of frozen unripe 
jackfruit, easily available in Asian markets.</p>

<h3>Be Aware:</h3> &nbsp; The product sold as "<b>Baby Jackfruit</b>" 
is not a jackfruit at all, it's a Vietnamese bitter gourd called 
<i>Gac</i>. For details see our 
<a href="gd_gacz.html"><b>Gac</b></a> page.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Uncut jackfruits keep a few days at room 
temperature but start to dry out, evidenced by cracking of the green 
outer rind between the points and softening of the stem end. Once cut 
the whole fruit should be completely disassembled. The yellow fruit 
arils can be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for a year or so. 
The seeds should be processed soon - they are not designed for 
durability and go to mold rather quickly. The "rag" is rarely used, 
but if you intend to, it should be cut from the rind and refrigerated 
for use within a few days.<p></p>

<img src="img/mb_jack20d.jpg" alt="Cut Jackfruit" class=mrg>
<h3>Preparing:</h3>: &nbsp; The biggest problem when preparing a fresh 
jackfruit is the white latex sap it exudes when cut. This sap is 
impervious to soaps and cleansers. I recommended you coat knives, 
cutting surface and your hands with oil before proceeding and be 
prepared to wash and re-oil occasionally.

<p><img src="img/mb_jack23d.jpg" alt="Jackfruit wedge, core removed" class=mrg>
A workable strategy is to cut the jackfruit in half lengthwise, then 
again lengthwise into quarters. Then cut out the core and start working 
on removing the seeds and fruit arils from the "rag". How difficult this 
is is highly variable depending on jackfruit cultivar and the individual 
fruit. You will probably have some rag adhering to the arils, but it 
pulls off easily.</p>

<p>The "rag" is not often used, but is edible. If you intend to use it, 
it should be cut away from the outer rind immediately, separating into 
individual strands and immersed in cold water acidulated with citric acid 
or lemon juice to prevent browning. After soaking for 15 minutes or so 
the rag can be squeezed out, bagged in plastic and refrigerated.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; An 18 pound jackfruit yielded 5 pounds 3 ounces 
of yellow fruit arils (29%), 1 pound 9.6 ounces of seeds (8.9%) and 1 
pound 3 ounces of easily recoverable rag (6.6%). That all makes 44.5% 
edible if you use the rag, 37.7% if you don't.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Clean-up:</h3> &nbsp; This is always a problem due to the latex. 
It's pretty much impervious to soap, detergent and even cleansers like 
Ajax or Comet. First wash off all the water soluble stuff, then use a 
solvent to clean off the latex. In Southeast Asia they use kerosine 
which is widely available there. I use Acetone or a similar solvent, 
as that's what I usually have on hand - and they don't leave a smell 
or oil residue like kerosene would.<p></p>

<img src="img/mb_jack24d.jpg" alt="Bowl of Jackfruit Arils" class=mrg>
<h3>Arils:</h3> &nbsp; These are the delicious gems of the jackfruit. 
They are about 1-3/4 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick, and 
weigh about 1-1/4 ounces. Each surrounds a large seed, but the seeds pop 
out very easily, leaving about 1 ounce of flesh. The arils of the variety 
we get here in California are quite firm with just a little crunch. 
They are moderately sweet and described as tasting like a combination of 
mango, pineapple and banana.
<p>The arils need no cooking and are often enjoyed just cut into chunks 
as a fruit desert, possibly mixed with other fruit. Of course there are 
many more complex deserts based on Jackfruit, including combined with 
rice balls and coconut milk. Fruit drinks and ice cream also often are 
flavored with Jackfruit.</p>
<p>In some regions, the arils are sliced, then deep fried to make 
Jackfruit Chips. These are durable and can be taken on trips.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/mb_jack28d.jpg" alt="Dish of Jackfruit Seeds" class=mrg>
<h3>Seeds:</h3> &nbsp;  These seeds are typically 1.2 inches long, 
0.9 inches wide and 0.6 inch thick, weighing about 1/4 ounce each. 
They have a thin, moderately hard outer shell, and a thin brown inner 
skin which can be left or scraped off, depending on preference. Some 
people let them sit out to dry until the shells crack, making them easier 
to peel. Others shell them after boiling and still hot and wet, when the 
shells will be quite soft. At room temperature raw seeds will go to mold 
in a few days, but bagged and refrigerated they will last more than a 
week.
<p>Jackfruit seeds are eaten cooked, as they may be slightly toxic raw. 
Most common is to boil them or roast them for use as a snack. The taste 
is much like chestnuts. Jackfruit seeds are also incorporated into 
curries, for which we finally have a recipe: 
<a href="../recipes/isv_jseedcy1.html"><b>Jackfruit Seed Curry</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/mb_jack26d.jpg" alt="Bowl of Jackfruit Rags" class=mrg>
<h3>Rags:</h3> &nbsp; The arils are embedded in the rags, which 
are actually flower ovaries that didn't develop into arils and seeds. 
These are not used in most regions, but we have finally found and 
improved a recipe from Konkani, India which makes them quite worthwhile 
as a snack or garnish: <a href="../recipes/iav_jfrag1.html"><b>Jackfruit 
Rag Fries</b></a>.  In Vietnam, researchers have been experimenting with 
extracting liquid from the rags using enzymes, and fermenting the liquid 
into a 5.5% alcoholic beverage, which has been judged palatable.<p></p>

<h3>Rinds:</h3> &nbsp; The outer rind is clearly inedible, hard and 
spiky. The inner rind from which the rags are removed can be quite 
bitter, or it can be almost entirely without flavor. I haven't seen any 
mention of people eating the rinds.

<h2 id=raw>Unripe Jackfruit / "Raw" Jackfruit</h2>

<p><a href="mb_jackrz.html">
<img src="img/mb_jackg02d.jpg" alt="Jackfruit Wedges" class=mrg></a>
Recipes that call for cooking jackfruit pretty much always call for 
unripe jackfruit, whether they say so or not. Recipes of Asian origin 
usually just presume you know that. In India unripe jackfruit is called 
"Raw Jackfruit", but many recipes just call for "Jackfruit". Unripe 
Jackfruit is often used in curries and the like. Because it is treated 
so differently from ripe jackfruit we have broken it out to a separate 
<a href="mb_jackrz.html"><b>"Raw" Jackfruit</b></a> page, for easy 
reference from recipes.
