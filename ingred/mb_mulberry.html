<h1>Mulberries</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The mulberry family (<i>Moraceae</i>) of order <i>Rosales</i> is 
found worldwide in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. American 
mulberries are but 3/4 inch long, but the mulberry family accounts also 
for the largest tree fruit in the world, exceeding 80 pounds and three 
feet long. All, from smallest to largest, bear a cluster fruit produced 
by a cluster of many flowers, each producing one seed and a small segment 
of the fruit. The odd one is the fig. It's just like the others but 
inside out.</p>
The photo shows a cluster of Jackfruit growing from the trunk of a tree - 
they're far too heavy to grow out on branches.

[Birch Flower (marketing); Alokon, Alakon, Alucon, Himbabao 
(Philippine Ilocano); Ba&eacute;g (Philippine Pangasinan); 
<i>Broussonetia luzonica</i>]
<p>
Despite appearances and the common English marketing name, this plant is 
in no way related to the birch tree. It is a member of the <i>Moraceae</i> 
family, the Mulberries. This large shrub is closely related to the Paper 
Mulberry, the bark fibers of which are used to make Japanese Washi paper 
and tissue.</p>

<p>While it grows all over the Philippines the male inflorescences and 
tender young leaves are only much used in the northeast (Luzon, etc.). 
Alokon is also a common non-native in Hawaii, but I don't know if anyone 
uses it for food there. &nbsp;

<h2>Breadfruit</h2>
<br><a href="mb_breadz.html">

<p>
This is the tree Captain Bligh was transporting on the Bounty, 
from Tahiti to Jamaica to feed slaves working the sugar plantations. His crew 
decided instead to take the ship back to Tahiti for more nookie. He later 
made the voyage successfully in HMS Providence and breadfruit has been a 
major food item in the Caribbean ever since. It gets its name from a 
bread-like aroma when roasted or baked. Breadfruits grow to about 8 inches in 
diameter and get up to about 10 pounds, but the photo specimen was about 
7 inches diameter and weighed 6-1/2 pounds.</p>
<p>There are two major categories of breadfruit: seeded and seedless. The 
seedless (see photo) is the kind you are most likely to find in markets. The 
seeded looks a lot like a small spherical <a href="mb_jackz.html">
Jackfruit</a>, inside and out, but less colorful. The seedless hybrids were 
distributed across the Pacific islands in prehistoric times. Clearly they 
could not have been spread by natural processes, being sterile. Breadfruit 
small enough to grow out at the end of the branches rather than from the 
trunk like Jackfruit.

<h2>Breadfruit, African</h2>
<br><img src="img/mb_brdfrtaf01c.jpg" alt="Drawing of African Breadfruit" class=mrg>
[Wild Jackfruit, African Boxwood: Afon (Yoruba); Ukwa (Igbo); Ediang 
(Efik, Ibibio); Nze (Benin); Bafutata (Hausa); <i>Treculia africana</i>]
<p>
This tree, up to 98 feet tall, is native to West and Central 
Africa. It produces fruit up to 19 pounds. Unlike the Pacific Breadfruit, 
it does not have a seedless variety, which is fine, because the seeds 
are the edible part. A mature tree can produce over 400 pounds of dried 
seeds a year. The seeds are highly nutritious, containing 38.3% 
carbohydrate, 17.7% crude protein, and 15.9% fat (fresh seeds). They can 
be pressed for oil, used as a replacement for yam or rice, and dry 
roasted for use as a snack, said to have a flavor similar to peanuts.

<h2 id="bnut">Breadnut</h2>
<br><img src="img/mb_maya02h.jpg" alt="Pile of Breadnut Nuts" class=mrg>

Ojite, Ojushte, Ujushte, Ujuxte, Capomo, Mojo, Ox, Iximche, Masica 
(Mesoamerica); <i>Brosimum alicastrum</i>]
<p>
This fruit was cultivated by the Maya 2000 years ago and today is quite 
popular in the southernmost parts of Mexico and in Guatemala. It can be 
dried or boiled in salt water and then dried for use as a snack. Stewed 
it tastes somewhat like potatoes. It can also be ground and made into 
bread, and when roasted it tastes similar to coffee.</p>
<p>Breadnut is very nutritious, high in fiber, calcium, potassium, folic 
acid, iron, zinc, protein and vitamins A, E, C and B. Neglected since the 
fall of Mayan civilization, this fruit is now being promoted as a 
commercial crop for village economies. When ripe the compound fruits 
break apart dropping individual Maya Nuts onto the forest floor where 
they are gathered. The trees grow to over 100 feet tall so harvesting 
by other methods would be difficult.

<h2>Fig</h2>
<br><a href="mb_figz.html">
<img src="img/mb_figmix05e.jpg" alt="Various Fresh Figs whole and cut" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Ficus carica</i>]
<p>
There are at least 850 species in the genus <i>Ficus</i>, almost all 
tropical trees, shrubs and vines. Only one temperate species, the Common 
Fig (<i>carica</i>) is significant for food. A few others have edible fruit 
but they are used only locally as "bush food".</p>
<p>The Common Fig is the most commercially important member of the whole 
mulberry family, and a strange fruit it is. Unlike other mulberries the 
flowers are <i>inside</i> with a small hole at the end of the fruit through 
which it's only pollinator, a wasp, can enter. Each species of fig has its 
own species of wasp and can be pollinated by no other.</p> 
<p>The photo specimens are Brown Turkey (2 inch diameter, 2-1/2 
ounces), Black Mission (1-1/4 inch diameter, 2 inches long, 7/8 ounce), and 
Calimyrna (1-5/8 inch diameter, 1-1/2 inch long, 1 ounce). The very sweet 
Black Mission and Calimyrna are the two varieties most often found fresh 
in California. The Brown Turkey is larger with a tougher skin, but is 
significantly less sweet.  Figs are complicated, and there's a lot more 
about them on the &nbsp; <a href="mb_figz.html"><b>Details and

<h2>Jackfruits <small>&amp;</small> Related</h2>
<br>Jackfruits is a generic term for a number similar mulberries in genus 
<i>Artocarpus</i>. They are all very large fruits, so large they cannot be 
supported out on the branches like even Breadfruit are, but grow on stems 
directly attached to the trunk and near the base of the largest limbs.

   <h2>Jackfruit - Common</h2>
   <br><a href="mb_jackz.html">
   <img src="img/mb_jack03e.jpg" alt="Whole Common Jackfruit Fruit" class=mrg></a>
   [Chakka (Malayalm); Jaka (Portuguese); Nangka (Malay), Mit (Viet); 
   Kanoon (Thai); Katahal (Hindi); <i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i> 
   many cultivars]
   <p>
   Jackfruit is probably native to the Indian subcontinent and was 
   carried to the Malay peninsula in ancient times. It has been 
   cultivated for between 3000 and 6000 years. Today it is grown in 
   almost all humid tropical lowland regions worldwide. A few are grown 
   in Florida but not commercially. A variety grown in west central 
   Mexico is different from the main Southeast Asian variety and is 
   smaller, sweeter and less starchy with a somewhat different fruit 
   cocktail-like flavor, but most shipped here from Mexico today are 
   the Southeast Asian type.</p>
   <p>Jackfruit is not only the largest of the mulberries, it's the 
   largest tree fruit in the world. How big they get varies by authority, 
   but 80 pounds and 3 feet long is a pretty safe number. Those sold in 
   North America generally run between 15 and 25 pounds. The photo 
   specimen was about 18 inches long, weighed 21 pounds and was grown 
   in Mexico.</p>
   <p>Except for the pointy outer rind, the entire fruit is edible in 
   various ways. Immature fruits, including inner rind, rags and seeds 
   are used in curries, The pulpy orange arils surrounding the seeds of 
   mature fruit are similar to a blend of banana and pineapple, and 
   simply used as fruit. The seeds are boiled briefly and then roasted 
   as a snack or sliced and used in curries.

   <h2>Jackfruit, "Raw"</h2>
   <br><a href="mb_jackrz.html">
   <img src="img/mb_jackg04h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Immature Jackfruit Fruit" class=mrg></a>
   [Kathal, Enchor (India); <i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i>]
   <p>
   This is an unripe jackfruit, but called "Raw Jackfruit" in most Indian 
   recipes. Many recipes, however, just call for "Jackfruit", but if it's 
   cooked like a vegetable you can presume unripe is what is meant. Whole 
   unripe fruit is not common in North America, but frozen is fairly 
   available, particularly in the Philippine markets. The photo specimen, 
   purchased at an Indian market in Los Angeles, was 6-3/4 inches long, 
   5-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 2 pounds 10 ounces.  &nbsp;

   [Chempedak; Mit To N&uuml; (Viet); <i>A. champeden</i> syn. 
   <i>A. integer</i> syn. <i>A. polyphema</i>, many unnamed varieties]
   <p>
   Native from Malaysia to New Guinea and now grown in Queensland, Australia, 
   this Jackfruit is more highly thought of in Vietnam than is the common 
   jackfruit, and sells at a significantly 
   higher price. It is much smaller and the fruit arils are softer than the 
   almost leathery arils of the big jackfruit, "rag" is not so much in the 
   way and the aroma and taste are a little more suggestive of Durian. In 
   Malaysia it's a popular item of street food - the arils (pulpy surround 
   of the seed) being dipped in batter and deep fried.

   <h2>Marang</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mb_marang1h.jpg" alt="Marang Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
   [Madang; Tarap; Johey Oak; <i>Artocarpus odoratissimus</i>]
   <p>
   This fruit is native to Borneo and some islands of the Philippines. It 
   is relatively small, 6 to 8 inches diameter, and considered structurally 
   midway between a jackfruit and a seeded breadfruit. Like the breadfruit 
   marang fruits grow from branches rather than the trunk.</p>
   <p>Internally it is much like a jackfruit but the fleshy arils are white 
   rather than orange and about the size of a grape, around 5/8 inch. There 
   is very little rag. They turn from green to greenish yellow when ripe 
   and can be picked not quite ripe and allowed to ripen off the tree.</p>
   <p>Many consider this fruit superior to both jackfruit and chempedak. To 
   open, the fruit is cut around the circumference and twisted apart. It must 
   then be eaten within two or three hours because the fruit quickly oxidizes 
   and looses flavor. The seeds can be roasted same as the jackfruit but 
   are smaller. &nbsp; <small>Photo from

   <br><img src="img/mb_amred01h.jpg" alt="American Mulberry Berries" class=mrg>
   [Red Mulberry, <i>Morus rubra</i>]
   <p>
   This tree is native to the eastern half of North America from within 
   Canada to Florida. It produces fruit that is medium to dark red ripening 
   to very dark red, purple or nearly black. The fruit, up to 3/4 inch 
   long, is edible and in some varieties is sweet and tasty enough to 
   compete with the Black (Persian) Mulberry. This mulberry is not exploited 
   commercially but is enjoyed by any who have access to a tree. The tree 
   is, however, endangered due to hybridization with the inferior Chinese 
   White Mulberry which has spread just about everywhere. &nbsp; 
   <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#iphoto">i0001</a>.</small>

   <h3>Black Mulberry</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/mb_persian01e.jpg" alt="Persian Black Mulberry Berries" class=mrg>
   [Persian Mulberry <i>Morus nigra</i>]
   <p>
   The Persian mulberry, when ripe, is dark, sweet and juicy - a truly 
   spectacular fruit and in great demand. If the fancy chefs on the West 
   Side knew I had a tree they'd be watching for times when I'm not at 
   home. These berries are fairly large, up to 1-1/2 inches long and 3/4 
   inch diameter. They are highly seasonal, my tree bearing ripe fruit 
   from mid July to mid August.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately they are a severe harvesting and shipping problem. When 
   ripe they are extremely delicate and highly perishable - and rather sour 
   when not ripe. When I go out to gather them I find many unripe ones 
   fall off the tree if you look at them hard, and some completely ripe 
   ones have so strong a grip they can't be picked without completely 
   destroying them - there's no consistency. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Chinese White Mulberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mb_china03e.jpg" alt="Chinese White Mulberry Berries" class=mrg>
   [<i>Morus alba</i>]
   <p>
   This tree originated in northern China, where its leaves are used to 
   feed silkworms. It has been carried to various parts of the world, 
   wherever someone thought they could set up a silk industry. They were 
   brought to North America long ago for such a scheme, but the industry 
   was never established here - even then labor costs were too high here.
   </p>
   <p>This tree is extremely effective at reproduction and now grows just 
   about everywhere in North America. The "volunteer" seedling I found in 
   my back yard canopied most of the yard in just a couple of years, 
   despite overhanging toxic blue gum eucalyptus. The berries are small, 
   moderately sweet and with a light but pleasant flavor. They're not 
   commercially viable, but I used to enjoy them as a child on the East 
   Coast and still like them. For a couple years I got almost none from 
   my huge tree because a flock of tiny brown birds knew exactly when to 
   swoop in and wiped them out. Lately they've came through weeks too 
   early and I'm now getting plenty,  The photo specimens are accompanied 
   by our ubiquitous red kidney bean for scale and a typical Persian 
   mulberry for comparison. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>White Mulberry, Dried</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mb_whitedry02e.jpg" alt="Dried White Mulberry Berries" class=mrg>
   [Y&ouml;r&uuml;k Dut Kurusu (Turkey); <i>Morus alba</i> var 
   <i>multicaulis</i>]
   <p>
   These are whiter and sweeter than the Chinese White Mulberry shown 
   above. Dried they run about 65 count to the ounce and are similar in 
   flavor to white raisins but drier.</p>
   <p>Dried white mulberries are used in the cuisines of Persia, the Stans 
   and Turkey. One use is to pop one after a sip of tea to sweeten the 
   mouth. I understand they are also included in some chickpea recipes. 
   They can be used similarly to raisins in baked goods and Western chefs 
   sometimes use them in sauces and toppings.</p>
   <p>Dried white mulberries can be found packed in plastic bags and tubs 
   in markets serving Turkish, Armenian and Iranian communities.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Long Mulberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mb_long05e.jpg" alt="Long Mlberry Berries" class=mrg>
   [Taiwan long mulberry; <i>Morus ???</i>]
   <p>
   I have found little about this mulberry except that several sites in 
   Taiwan and China are selling cuttings. Reportedly a nursery here in 
   Southern California sells trees, attributing them to Afghanistan / 
   Pakistan. In June 2013 I purchased the photo specimense at a big 
   farmer's market in Pasadena, California. They were 2-3/4 inches long 
   and 1/2 inch in diameter.</p>
   <p>The price for a tiny basket was so high my mind immediately erased 
   it from memory to prevent distress. The flavor was just as highly 
   disappointing - faint flavor, faint sweetness. Berries from the huge 
   (volunteer) Chinese mulberry tree taking over my back yard are far 
   and away better. Until I encounter better long mulberries, I'm 
   declaring them to be of decorative value only.
