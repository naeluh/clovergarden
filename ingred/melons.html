<h1>Melons</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Melons are all "Cucumbers" (Cucurbits or <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>) to 
the botanist, along with squash, gourds and actual cucumbers. To the 
agriculturist they are are all "vine crops". All are technically "fruit" but 
in culinary practice all are treated as  "vegetables" except the melons which 
are treated as fruit.</span>

</ul>

<h2 class=lrg id="hist">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>There are two broad categories of melon and one odd one.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Muskmelons:</h3> &nbsp; <i>C. Cucumis melo</i>, the same genus as 
  Cucumbers, probably originated in Western Asia (Persia and surrounding).
  These melons have thick walls and hollow centers containing loose seeds 
  and fibers.</li>
<li><h3>Watermelons:</h3> &nbsp; <i>C. Citrullus lanatus</i>, of African 
  origin. These melons have solid, almost uniform flesh all the way 
  through with seeds embedded in the flesh.</li>
<li><h3>Horned Melons</h3> &nbsp; <i>C. metuliferus</i>, of African origin 
  and internally built more like a <a href="gd_tindoz.html">
  Tindora Gourd</a> than like any of the other melons.</li>
</ul>  


<p>Melons are generally eaten mature when the flesh becomes sweet, which 
contrasts with gourds, squash and cucumbers which are eaten immature. The 
rind is tough but not hard and the flesh is always watery. Most are eaten 
raw but some are cooked, particularly in soup. Most have thick walls and a 
hollow center containing seeds, but the Watermelons are solid and uniform 
all the way through with seeds embedded in the flesh. Most melons will store 
at room temperature maybe a week and not much longer refrigerated, but there 
are a few, such as the Hami and Christmas melons that will store much longer 
at room temperature.</p>


<h2 id="term">Melon Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Sutures</b> - grooves running from the flower end to the stem end.</li>
<li><b>Netting</b> - a raised pattern of lines in a netlike pattern, generally 
  light tan in color, These are very intense on the familiar muskmelon.</li>
<li><b>Slip</b> - dropping the stem when ripe. A melon that normally slips, 
  such as a muskmelon, that has some stem or tears where the stem was is 
  picked too unripe. Many melon types do not slip so some stem or stem 
  tear is normal for those.</li>
<li><b>Winter melon</b> - commercial term for late maturing varieties, not 
  to be confused with the "Winter Melon" seen (usually cut in large chunks) 
  in most Asian markets, which is actually a gourd.</li>
</ul>
  

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>All Melons (with the exception of Watermelons) are of the same species, 
<i>C. melo</i>, so can be interbred to create new varieties. There are, 
however, several recognized <i>C. melo</i> varietal groups.

<ul>
<li><b><i>Cantalupensis group</i></b> &nbsp; (now includes 
  <i>Reticulatus</i>) have an often netted rind and aromatic flesh 
  ranging from salmon to orange but sometimes green. These include the 
  muskmelon (called Cantaloupe in the U.S.), true cantaloupes, Persian 
  melons, and others. These melons slip their stems when ripe. 
  <i>Reticulatus</i> designates the netted rind melons as distinct 
  from true cantaloupes which are sutured but not netted.</li>
<li><b><i>Conomon Group:</i></b> &nbsp; Oriental pickling melons, used in 
  Korea and Japan. Not found in North America and scarce in Korea.
<li><b><i>Inodorous Group:</i></b> &nbsp; late-maturing melons called 
  "winter melons" in U.S. agriculture, including crenshaws, casabas, 
  honeydews, Juan Canary, Santa Claus. These melons have non-aromatic 
  flesh usually green or white but sometimes orange. They do not slip 
  their stems when ripe.</li>
<li><b><i>Flexuosus group:</i></b> &nbsp; the snake melons, or snake 
  cucumbers (not to be confused with the snake gourds).</li>
<li><b><i>Conomon group:</i></b>  &nbsp; Oriental pickling melons. 
  Generally smooth, cylindrical, green, white or striped, with white 
  flesh.</li>
<li><b><i>Dudaim group:</i></b> &nbsp; mango melon, pomegranate melon, 
  Queen Annes melon. These are small and round to oval, light green, 
  yellow or striped with firm yellowish-white flesh. Not seen in North 
  America.</li>
<li><b><i>Adzur Group / Chate Group</i></b> &nbsp; Ancient melons always 
  eaten unripe. They are still grown in Egypt, the Levant, and Puglia Italy. 
  they are closely related to the <i>Flexuosus</i> group, with properties 
  similar to the Armenian Cucumber. Not seen in North America.</li> 
<li><b><i>Mormordica group:</i></b> &nbsp; phoot and snap melons. The 
  fruit is oval or cylindrical with smooth skin that cracks at maturity. 
  Not seen in North America.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Afghan Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_afgmellon01h.jpg" alt="Whole Afghan Melon" class=mrg>
[<i>reticulatus</i> group]
<p>This melon is similar to the <a href="melons.html#persia"><b>Persian Melon</b></a> 
but greener with rather sparser netting. They are only moderately sweet 
so should be selected with a fair amount of flex at the flower end to 
assure ripeness. I haven't seen these for awhile, but they're sure to 
become more common in the future. When the U.S. pulls the troupes out of 
Afghanistan anyone who cooperated will have to leave the country and 
they'll head straight for Los Angeles where every other ethnic group 
has settled. Soon they'll be opening restaurants and demanding Afghan 
melons in the markets.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Ananas Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_ananas01h.jpg" alt="Whole Ananas Melon" class=mrg>
[Middle Eastern melon]
<p>There seems to be a lot of variation in melons called "Ananas". 
Some by this name are spherical and have sutures, and may also have 
light netting or blotching. Others are oval and lightly netted over 
green or orange skin, with no or very faint sutures. The photo specimen 
is sold as "Melon Ananas d'Am&eacute;rique &agrave; Chair Rougea" and 
is said to be similar to those grown by Thomas Jefferson in his garden - 
or by his slaves, anyway. Another "Melon Ananas d'Am&eacute;rique 
&agrave; Chair Verte" has green and yellow flesh and yellow skin with 
light sutures and very light netting. The photo is of an unripe "Melon 
Ananas d'Am&eacute;rique &agrave; Chair Rougea". The light splotches 
will be more white when fully mature. In any case, the flesh is 
aromatic and very sweet, and the melons are from 3 to 5 pounds in weight.

<h2>Armenian Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="ml_armoz.html">
<img src="img/ml_armo07e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Armenian Cucumbers" class=mrg></a>
[Snake Melon / Snake Cucumber,  Uri (Japan), Metki, Mikti (Near East), Wild 
Cucumber (commercial), <i>Cucumis melo</i> var. <i>flexuosus</i>]
<p>Market size varies widely from 6 inches long and 1-1/4 inches 
diameter to 21 inches long and 2-1/2 inches diameter but they can grow to 
a yard long and over 3 inches in diameter. They are very much like a 
cucumber in structure and in taste, if raw. The skin is very thin and 
tender and is almost never peeled. Smaller sizes are often pickled and 
the resulting pickles have a rather different flavor from cucumber 
pickles.</p>
<p>Armenian cucumbers are seasonally available fresh in Southern 
California (May to July) and are grown as a garden vegetable in Florida 
and other suitable areas, but I understand they're almost impossible to 
find fresh in Armenia. Pickled they can be found in any market serving 
a Western Asian or Near Eastern community. They're usually packed in 
Lebanon or surrounding regions and labeled "Mikti" or "Wild Cucumber". 
The front photo specimen was 12 inches long (uncut), 2 inches diameter 
and weighed 14-5/8 ounces. The middle one was 14-1/2 inches long (if 
straight) 1-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 10-1/8 ounces

<h2 id="canary">Canary Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_canary11e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Canary Melon" class=mrg>
[Juan Canary, Jaune des Canaries, Amarillo, PLU #4317, <i>C. melo</i> 
(Indorus group)]
<p>
This bright yellow mellon, oblong and pointy at the ends like an 
American football, is now grown by the truck load in California.  A fully 
ripe Canary is about as sweet as melons get. The flesh is firm, almost 
crisp, white to faintly greenish, and light pink or orange around the 
seed cavity. Select melons that are bright yellow and springy at the 
flower end but not mushy. This melon is a yellow variety of the 
<a href="melons.html#piel"><b>Piel de Sapo</b></a>, a melon popular in Spain. The photo 
specimen was 9 inches long, 6 inches diameter and weighed 5 pounds 7 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cantal">Cantaline</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_kandi06e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Cantaline" class=mrg>
[Orange Flesh Melon, Kandy Melon, PLU #4327]
<p>
This cross between a cantaloupe and a honeydew has been grown more 
in South America than in North America, but is becoming more available 
here. It's marketed as "Orange Flesh Melon" and "Kandy Melon". The flesh 
tastes similar to cantaloupe, is firm, almost crisp, and quite sweet right 
to the thin rind. The rind is smooth with some scattered netting and when 
ripe becomes quite pale, sometimes almost white. Also look for some 
springiness at the flower end. The photo specimen was 6 inches diameter 
and weighed 3 pound 13 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=cantru>Cantaloupe</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_cantat01h.jpg" alt="Whole True Cantaloupe" class=mrg>
[<i>var reticulatus</i>]
<p></p>The true Cantaloupe is seldom grown outside southern Europe, 
mostly Italy. Unlike the Muskmelon the skin is hard, deeply sutured, 
warty  and lacks the orderly netting of the Muskmelons. See 
<a href="melons.html#dtuscan">Dulcinea "Tuscan Style" Cantaloupe</a> and 
<a href="melons.html#musk">Muskmelon</a> for melons available in North America.
<br class=cll><p></p> 

<h2>Cantaloupe - Muskmelon</h2>
<br><a href="melons.html#musk">
<img src="img/ml_muskw09s.jpg" alt="Muskmelon 09s" class=mrg></a>
<p>
The common market "Cantaloupe" in the U.S. is actually a Muskmelon, 
not a <a href="melons.html#cantru"><b>True Cantaloupe</b></a>. I realize the entire 
fruit and grocery industries go along with calling it "cantaloupe", but 
I'm going to call it a <a href="melons.html#musk"><b>Muskmelon</b></a> anyway - and 
besides, that's what my Connecticut based family called it when I was a 
child.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cantaloupe - Athena</h2>
<br>A preferred <a href="melons.html#musk"><b>Muskmelon</b></a> for growing in the 
Eastern U.S. because they mature early, this oval melon has coarse netting 
over a yellow-orange rind and is usually lightly sutured. The flesh of 
this 5 to 6 pound melon is yellow-orange and firm.<p></p>

<h2>Cantaloupe - "Tuscan Style"</h2>
<br><a href="melons.html#dtuscan">
<img src="img/ml_musk04s.jpg" alt="Dulcinea Tuscan Melon" class=mrg></a>

<h2>Carosello &amp; Barattiere</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_carosello01e.jpg" alt="Pile of small unripe Italian melons" class=mrg>
[<i>Cucumis melo</i> subsp. <i>melo</i>, probably Chate Group (syn. 
Adzhur Group)]
<p>
These Melons are grown mainly in Puglia, in the heel of Italy, where they 
are highly thought of - the rest of Italy may be too cool. They come in many 
shapes, and are closely related to the first melons to be cultivated in 
Ancient Egypt, the <a href="melons.html#chate"><b>Chate Melons</b></a> and Snake Melons. 
They are always eaten in the unripe form, as Cucumbers are. Their 
characteristics are similar to the closely related 
<a href="ml_armoz.html"><b>Armenian Cucumber</b></a>, a Snake Melon.

<h2>Casaba Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_casab07e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Casaba Melon" class=mrg>
[PLU #4320, <i>C. melo</i> (Inodorus group)]
<p>
This fairly large mellon (4 to 10 pounds) has a wrinkly skin and is 
usually flat at the flower end and with a point where the stem attaches. 
The white to slightly yellow flesh has little flavor and is only lightly 
sweet when the melon is fully ripe. It ripens unevenly, very soft near 
the seeds and still rather firm near the rind. Personally, I don't see 
the point of this melon since sweeter, more flavorful melons are available 
at the same price per pound.</p>
<p>Casabas are ripe when the flower end has plenty of give but is still 
springy. This melon has no odor so that isn't an indicator of ripeness, 
and it does not slip when ripe so stems or stem tears are not an 
indicator it was picked too soon. The photo specimen was 8-1/2 inches 
diameter, 7-1/2 inches long and weighed 9 pounds 3 ounces. The Casaba 
melons originated in western Asia and in the U.S. is grown mainly in 
California.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cavaillon Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_cav02e.jpg" alt="Pile of Cavallon Melon" class=mrg>
A French variety of the True Cantaloupe from the town of Cavaillon. 
It is considered very highly for flavor and is now grown in various places 
around the world including the USA. Some are grown in California but I 
have yet to see them in the markets - they probably all go to the fancy 
chef set. The flesh is a light orange and they are said to be ripe when 
a small crack appears at the stem end, as in the photo.

<h2>Cavion Melon</h2>
<br>A small globe shaped European melon with gray-green netted rind and 
very shallow dark green sutures. The flesh is intensely orange and 
fragrant. Could be a misspelling of a variety of Cavaillon Melon.<p></p> 

<h2>Charentais Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_charen05e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Charentais Melon" class=mrg>
[French Breakfast Melon, Chaca, Italian Melon, French Kiss (marketing); 
Hakucho (Japan); <i>Cantalupensis</i> group]
<p>
This is a small European melon, globe shaped with a smooth to 
slightly netted gray, gray-blue or yellow-green rind with distinct but 
shallow sutures. Flesh color ranges from greenish to intense orange 
depending on cultivar. Some sources say if the color of the rind becomes 
yellowish they are over-ripe, but, again, that seems to vary with 
cultivar - these were just about perfect.as shown.</p> 
<p>This is an aromatic melon with flesh that's exceptionally sweet right 
out to the very thin rind. Flavor is quite attractive and somewhat lighter 
than cantaloupe. This is the favorite melon of the French, who commonly 
use it as a breakfast melon. Cut in half it will serve two. They also 
split them in half, scoop them out and fill with a sweet wine such as 
Marsala or Madeira to serve as an appetizer. The larger of the photo 
specimens (the cut one) was 5 inches diameter and 2 pounds 3-1/4 ounces. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="chate">Chate Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_chate01h.jpg" alt="Two Whole Chate Melons" class=mrg>
[Adzhur Melon; <i>Cucumis melo</i> subsp. <i>melo</i> Chate Group 
(syn. Adzhur Group)]
<p>
This is the first melon to be cultivated, and was popular in Ancient Egypt, 
from where it traveled into the Levant. It is still grown in Egypt today. 
Most translations of ancient documents call it "cucumber", but the cucumber 
was unknown in the region until much later, introduced from India during 
Classical Greek and Roman times. On the other hand, like the 
<a href="ml_armoz.html"><b>Armenian Cucumber</b></a>, a Snake Melon, it 
is eaten immature and is very much cucumber-like. Unlike the cucumber, it's 
outside is very fuzzy.

<h2 id="xmas">Christmas Melon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_santa07h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Christmas Melon" class=mrg>
[Santa Claus, <i>Inodorus</i> group]
<p>
These 5 to 8 pound football (US) shaped melons have a mottled 
yellow or green rind and pale green or pale orange flesh depending on 
variety. The photo specimen was 8-3/4 inches long, 6 inches diameter and 
weighed 5 pounds. They are very sweet when ripe and are similar to 
<a href="melons.html#piel"><b>Piel de Sapo</b></a> with some varieties looking very much 
like that melon but others are smoother and some have a little or a lot 
of netting as in the photo. These melons get the name Christmas or Santa 
Claus from their late season harvest excellent keeping properties - even 
to Christmas if stored in a cool place.

<img src="img/ml_citron01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Citron Melons" class=mrg></a>
[Pie melon (U.S.), Tsanna <i>Citrullus lanatus</i> var. <i>citroides</i>]
<p>
This melon is thought to be ancestral to the <a href="melons.html#water">
<b>Watermelon</b></a> and originated in Africa. It now grows wild in Baja 
California though no one knows how it got there. It is also both 
cultivated and considered a weed in much of the Southern U.S. though 
rarely in pure form there due to accidental cross breeding with 
commercial watermelons.</p>
<p>This melon is not to be confused with the citrus fruit 
<a href="ci_citronz.html">Citron</a>, though they are both used mainly 
candied or as preserves and pickles. Citron melon is very high in pectin 
so is a desirable ingredient for preserves. The flesh is much stiffer and 
more strongly flavored than that of watermelon.

<h2>Colocynth</h2>
<br><img src="img/ml_colocynth01e.jpg" alt="Melons on the Desert" class=mrg>
[Bitter Apple, Bitter Cucumber, Desert Gourd, Egusi, Vine of Sodom, 
Wild Gourd; <i>Citrullus colocynthis</i>]
<p>This melon grows under very harsh arid conditions. It is found in the 
Sahara Desert and Sahel regions of Africa, and ranges as far east as India. 
It was well known in Ancient Egypt, and there is evidence it was in use at 
least as far back as the Neolithic.</p>
<p>Colocynth is related to the <a href="melons.html#citron"><b>Citron Melon</b></a> and 
Watermelon, but the fruit is less than 4 inches in diameter, and its white 
flesh is dry, spongy, and very bitter. The seeds are also somewhat bitter. 
They are pressed for oil, or are roasted and eaten whole. These seeds are 
used to make <a href="ml_egusiz.html"><b>Egusi</b></a>, a thickener used 
in West Africa, but seeds of other watermelons may also be used. In Nigeria, 
Colocynth is intercropped with Cassava. It is cultivated in India, and on 
a small scale on the island of Cyprus.

<p>This is a hybrid between the Casaba and Persian melons that weighs in 
at 5 pounds or higher. It is a bit flattened at the stem end giving it an 
acorn shape. The skin, though still wrinkly is a bit smoother than the 
Casaba. Yellow when ripe, older varieties have green flesh and newer ones 
have salmon pink flesh.

<p>
This melon is pretty much inedible, but is a popular garden decorative. It is 
also valued for its strong perfume-like aroma. The photo specimes are fully 
ripe and orange, but some cultivars pass through many colors as they mature. 
The flesh is thin and insipid, though some cultivars may have a hint of 
sweetness. Other cultivars may also be very sour or bitter. These melons 
originated in Persia around the 9th century CE and were carried as far as 
Andalusia by Islamic invaders. They are generally 3 inches diameter or less.

An Israeli melon with a netted rind similar to a 
<a href="melons.html#musk"><b>Muskmelon</b></a> but paler in color and not as distinctly 
netted. It is a cross of Cantaloupe and Honeydew. The flesh is pale 
green to white, similar to a <a href="melons.html#honey"><b>Honeydew</b></a>, and has a 
banana like aroma. These slip their stems when ripe so any stem or 
stem tears indicate picking before fully ripe. They are now common in 
Southern California, grown here, in the U.S. South and in South and 
Central America.<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 class=lrg>Gaya Melon</h2> 
There are several varieties of Gaya mellon, so different from each other 
you would wonder why they have the same name. The two here are the most 
available, and both are most likely to be found in Asian markets.<p></p>


<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Ivory Gaya Melon</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ml_japana05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Ivory Gaya Melon" class=mrg>
   Originally from Japan, this melon is now grown in Mexico and 
   South America, but the photo specimen was procured at a Los Angeles 
   farmer's market from a Japanese grower who described it only as 
   "Japanese Melon". I have recently seen it in one of the larger Asian 
   markets in Los Angeles. It has excellent keeping properties (these 
   melons sat around on my kitchen floor for nearly 2 months before I 
   got around to photographing them). The rind is very thin, the flesh 
   is crisp and moderately sweet and the stems were not slipped. 
   <br class=cll><p></p>
   
   <h3>Chamelon Gaya Melon</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ml_gayac02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Chamelon Gaya Melon" class=mrg>
   On the outside this mellon looks a lot like a

<p>
I have Purchased these from Asian markets in Los Angeles from early 
July through August, sold as "Green Melon" or "Taiwan Green Melon". 
A seed company reports they are used for cooking in various ways. 
The largest of the photo specimens weighed 1 pound 6 ounces, 4 inches 
diameter and 4.5 inches long. Most are smaller. 2018 US $1.99 / pound.
</p>
<p>These were sold not quite ripe with crisp, very moderately sweet 
flesh, as would be expected for a pickling melon. The flesh becomes 
fairly soft when fully ripe, with just a touch of crispness near the 
peel. Fully ripe the flesh is moderately sweet and the flavor is 
similar to Honey Dew, but not as sweet. To chose one that is optimally 
ripe, look for a yellow blush on part of the melon. If it is all 
yellow it may be over ripe.

<h2>Hami Melon</h2>
<br>[<i>reticulatus</i> group]
<p>This type of "Chinese muskmelon" originated around Hami in the Uighur 
lands of Central Asia now claimed by China as Xinjiang Uygur A. R. 
provence. Several varieties are now grown in California and Oregon as 
well as in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other adjacent Central Asian 
countries.</p>
<p>They are generally football (US) shaped with a yellow-green lightly 
to only vaguely netted rind and orange, salmon, white or green flesh. The 
flesh is distinguished by being fairly crisp, even brittle, and most are 
just medium sweet. The flesh freezes well so they are good for frozen 
deserts. Hamis keep well and will store for a couple of weeks or more at 
a cool room temperature.

   [PLU #4332]<p>This is the Hami melon most common in Southern California 
   markets. They can grow to as much as 11 pounds but the photo specimen 
   was 7 pounds 3 ounces, a bit above average, and was purchased in mid 
   July. The rind is yellow-green and lightly netted. The flesh may be 
   orange, salmon, white or green depending on variety. It is crisp and 
   light, almost airy, with medium sweetness and medium melon flavor.</p>
   <p>To be sweet these melons need to be very ripe, so select ones that 
   have a fair amount of give at the flower end (but no sign of rot). 
   They will ripen more if left sitting on the kitchen floor, but it's 
   a long lasting melon so it'll take time. These melons do not slip

[<i>reticulatus</i> group]
<p>
A round to slightly oval melon with strong netting on a green rind. 
They are generally 3 to 4 pounds with very sweet white to green flesh. 
In Japan these are very expensive "gift melons" selling for around US 
$100 each. They are hothouse grown with controlled heat to assure 
highest possible sweetness, and then expensively packaged. These melons 
don't slip, but stem tears would be unthinkable, so they are normally 
sold with a piece of the vine still attached. Young melons are sometimes 
scratched to produce scars if the netting pattern needs a little filling 
out. In California these melons could be field grown, but nobody seems 
to bother.

<p>This odd African melon is grown in the Kenya, Israel, New Zealand 
and the U.S. as a decorative fruit and in Australia as a noxious weed. 
Now grown commercially in California they have a long shelf life and are 
easily shipped so you will find a few in supermarkets but often at prices 
that will leave you gasping. The photo specimen was 4-3/4 inches long, 
2.8 inches diameter and weighed 11-3/4 ounces, from a small chain 
supermarket for $2.99 each or $4.07 / pound. Major supermarkets may 
charge as much as $4.99 per melon.</p> 
<p>They are sold mainly as a curiosity and are not expected to be a 
viable food crop until varieties with a higher sugar content are 
developed. Currently they have a light refreshing flavor but are not 
real sweet. It's the seed mass you eat as there is very little edible 
flesh inside the hard rind. <b>Note:</b> seed merchants are also selling 
purely decorative varieties which look about the same but are very

This small bright yellow melon with shallow light yellow sutures 
is commonly found in Chinese and Korean markets. The photo specimen was 
typical at 1 pound 1-1/4 ounces, 4-1/2 inches long and 3.5/8 inches 
diameter. It was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2016 US $1.79 / pound. The most perfect ones are 
sold in Korean markets at a significantly higher price.</p>
<p>The crisp flesh of this melon is white to pale peach and moderately 
sweet. The rind is very thin and doesn't need to be peeled, though it 
commonly is peeled. The seeds are very small and soft, and the seed mass 
is always eaten with the flesh as it is by far the sweetest part. In Korea 
there are many varieties, and many are pickled, or even made into kimchee. 
Only the sweetest varieties are marketed in North America, but they can 
still be pickled. This is a perishable melon and should be eaten within

   A round melon that is little seen outside the growing area in eastern 
   North America because it doesn't ship well. Unlike the common Western 
   Muskmelon these have both netting and sutures. The flesh is orange 
   (some green fleshed varieties are grown) and they have a distinctive

   This round melon is commonly called "Cantaloupe" in the U.S., but is 
   not a <a href="melons.html#cantru"><b>True Cantaloupe</b></a>. These melons have 
   very dense netting and no sutures, orange flesh, a distinct aroma when 
   fully ripe and the familiar muskmelon flavor. The flesh is quite firm 
   even when fully ripe, the rind is strong and they keep a couple of 
   weeks making them the preferred muskmelon for U.S. commerce. These 
   slip, so the stem scar should be deep and smooth at the bottom with 
   no stem fragments or tears, which would indicate it was picked unripe 
   and will have inferior flavor.</p>

<h2>Papaya Melon</h2>

This melon, is popular in Asia. I found the photo specimens at a large 
farmer's market in Pasadena, California at the absurd price of US $1.69 / 
pound (fortunately they are small). I also found a Web page describing 
this melon (with photo) from Singapore. They're a bit more expensive 
there at S$25 (US $17). The melon shown appeared substantially smaller 
than mine, so that'd probably be about US $17 per pound.
<p>Of course in Asia these melons are very carefully grown to make sure 
appearance is perfect, because the two most potent flavor enhancements 
used in Asia are perfect appearance and an absurdly high price. The photo 
specimen was 5-3/4 inches long, 4 inches diameter and 1 pound 9-3/4

variety is the one most grown and sold in Southern California. The

the Persian does not slip it's stem when ripe, so a bit of stem or stem 
tears do not mean it was picked too green.

[Toad Skin Melon, <i>C. melo</i> (Indorus group)]
<p>
The name, literally "toad skin", describes the green and yellow blotched 
coloration and bumpy texture of these melons. They may be lightly and 
randomly sutured - or not. It is a very popular melon in Spain and grown 
in Central and South America for export to Spain in the off season, but 
is only just beginning to appear in other European markets. Some are now 
grown in Arizona, Colorado and California but they are not yet common 
here. Similar Spanish melons are the Rochet and Tendral, while this 
general type of melon is represented in North America more by a yellow 
version, the <a href="melons.html#canary"><b>Canary Melon</b></a> and by the late 
season <a href="melons.html#xmas"><b>Christmas Melon</b></a>.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 8 inches long, 5 inches diameter and weighed 
4 pounds 7-3/4 ounces. The flesh is firm and fairly sweet, shading from 
green at the rind to slightly orange near the seeds. The rind is about 
1/4 inch thick, and the seed cavity is small but packed tightly with 
seeds. These are long lived melons - both the whole and cut ones sat on

In appearance it looks like an elongated orange musk melon but the 
flesh inside is light yellow-green and tastes more like a bland but fairly 
sweet honeydew. The flesh ranges from very soft in the center to firm at 
the rind. They are ripe when the background color turns from green to 
light orange and there is some give at the flower end. Also check the 
stem end because that's where they often start to rot. They are extremely 
perishable keeping for only a few days once ripe. The seed mass of a ripe 
melon is often completely liquid and can be poured out. The photo 
specimen was 4 pounds 5 ounces, 8 inches long and 5-1/2 inches diameter 
- a bit more elongated than most.

<h2>Sugar Kiss Melon</h2>

between Galia and Charentias melons, with faintly greenish color, faint 
netting and very faint sutures. This melon has soft, deep orange  
flesh which tastes pretty much like sugar water. The melon flavor is as 
faint as the netting and sutures.
<p>I was very critical of this melon when it first appeared, but in 2018 
I bought two slightly different melons under the name "Sugar Kiss Melon",

have some tan tracery which is said to indicate a high sugar content. 
It is about the size of a grapefruit, weighing between 1 and 1.5 pounds, 
with white flesh that's crisp, juicy and very sweet. It's said to taste 
similar to a combination of honeydew, pear and watermelon, but sweeter 
than any of those. They are perishable but can be kept refrigerated up 
to a week. Some are grown in North Carolina, California and Arizona, 
with availability from May to July. &nbsp;

<img src="img/ml_water03h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Watermelons" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>]
<p>
Watermelons originated in southern Africa but were already grown as a 
crop in Egypt 5000 years ago and are now planted throughout the world. 
China got them in the 10th century CE and is now the largest producer. 
They were brought to North America in the 16th century where California, 
Georgia, Arizona and Texas are the major producers.</p>
<p>Watermelon fruit is unlike the <i>Cucumus</i> melons of Western Asia in 
that they are not hollow in the center but have a uniform pulp throughout. 
Many sizes have been developed (the examples here are 22 pounds for the 
large and 3-3/4 pounds for the small) and a number of colors. Yellow and 
white are fine for decorative accents, but as usual I recommend the 
standard red color as the best tasting,</p>
<p>Seedless Watermelons are not actually without seeds, but the seeds are 
all or mostly immature, white and very soft when the melon is ripe. 
Making a seedless watermelon is quit a feat of genetic engineering, but 
personally I don't see the point - I've always just swallowed the seeds 
anyway so they don't bother me. I find the standard watermelon to have 
better flavor and texture than the manipulated ones, and I am not 
alone in this opinion.</p>
<p>The ancestral Watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i> var <i>citroides</i>), 
known as the <a href="melons.html#citron"><b>Citron Melon</b></a>, is still extant 
and is now wild in Southern and Baja California, though nobody knows how 
it got there. The white flesh is so firm it's sort of "rind all the way 
through" but its high pectin content makes it popular for preserves.

[<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>]
<p>
These melons were grown in Mexico, but specifically for the Vietnamese 
Tet festival, the begining of Spring. They each had a big red Tet sticker 
on them. The colors yellow and red are very important to the festival, 
and this melon provides both. Mercifully, it has seeds, as it would not 
be appropriate to celebrate Spring with a sterile melon. The large one 
was 10-3/4 inches long, 6-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 9 pounds 9 
ounces. It had excellent watermelon flavor and texture. These were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2018 US $0.99 / pound. With Tet only 6 days away, many in the market 
were buying red and yellow flowers for their home altars (the dominant 
religion in Vietnam is the native folk religion).

<p>Melons are non-toxic, non-fat and low in calories, but due to their 
very high water content they have modest nutritional value. Orange 
fleshed melons are fairly high in vitamin A, some rating even USDA 
"Excellent Source", and also foliate and potassium. Green or white 
fleshed melons provide little but potassium.</p>

<p>Melons need almost no digestion. Eaten on an empty stomach they will 
go on through immediately. On two occasions, to test reports that 
scientists had found a Viagra-like substance in watermelon, I ate an 
entire 12 pound watermelon in one sitting. This is not difficult for me 
because once I start on a watermelon I just can't stop. I'll eat until 
I'm in pain, then lie down until I can eat more.</p>
<p>No Viagra-like effect whatever was observed (and in one case I ate the 
rind out to the peel in case it was there), but they did sweep my guts 
absolutely bright sparkling clean.</p>
