<span class=tf>Arrrrgg! How could I do this?</span> &nbsp; I have lumped 
on the same page two plant families that differ at the <u>Top Clade 
Level</u>. Yams are monocots and Morning Glorys are astrid eudicots - 
you just can't get any farther apart and still be flowering plants. Well, 
they look so similar (twining vines with tuberous roots and heart shaped 
leaves) and are used so similarly, they are commonly confused. Putting 
them in one place helps sort them out.

<h2 id="mglory" class=lrg>Morning Glories</h2>

<p>The Morning Glory family (<i>Convolvulaceae</i>) are eudicots found 
worldwide in all climates, but the culinary ones all belong to the genus 
<i>Ipomoea</i>, which inhabits only tropical and subtropical regions. 
A few of the other genera produce seeds which are sometimes ingested 
but not for the purpose of nutrition.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="spy">Sweet Potatoes <small>&amp;</small> U.S. "Yams"</h2>

<p>Sweet potato vines are members of the Morning Glory family native to 
Central America and the Caribbean. They are unrelated to true potatoes 
which are Nightshades. They produce an edible "storage root" which is 
non-toxic and under proper "curing" conditions converts part of its 
starches to sugars making it sweet.</p>
<p>The United States grows less than 1% of worldwide production. The rest 
is grown in Asia and Africa, with China accounting for more than 
80% of world production.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the developers of the orange fleshed Sweet 
Potato, to differentiate if from the white ones, called it "Yam", from 
"Nyami" an African word for real Yams, and used by African slaves in 
the American South for sweet potatoes. Now, markets in North America 
call any sweet potato of any color but white "Yam". This continues to 
cause serious confusion.</p>

<p>Sweet potatoes are further evidence of contact between South America 
and the Pacific Islands in pre-Colombian times. The Quechua (Peru) name 
for sweet potatoes is Kamar. The name Kamara and similar are common in 
Polynesia and New Zealand. It is certain the Pacific Islands had sweet 
potatoes before European contact, and that they couldn't have floated 
that far on their own. They must have been taken from the Americas by 
boat. Conversely, it is now known that Chickens, DNA traceable to 
Polynesia, were available in South America before European contact.</p>

   <h3>Sweet Potato, White</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mg_swpotwht01e.jpg" alt="White Sweet Potato" class=mrg>
   [Boniatos (Caribbean); <i>C. Ipomoea batatas</i>]
   <p>
   These are the standard grocery store white sweet potato. Sweet potatoes 
   (red or white) are not particularly sweet at harvest but are "cured" at 
   85&deg;F for 4 to 7 days during which some of the starch is converted 
   to sugar. Pictured are 1/2 pound potatoes.</p>
   <p> Select firm sweet potatoes with no soft spots. <u>Do not 
   refrigerate</u> Sweet Potatoes. Temperatures below 55&deg;F will make 
   them hard and ruin the flavor. They should be stored loose (not in 
   plastic) and kept away from sunlight. Stored at 55&deg;F to 60&deg;F 
   and 90% humidity they'll keep for several months but in a normal 
   household environment they should be used within a couple of weeks.

   <h3>U.S. "Yam"</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mg_swpotred01e.jpg" alt="Red Sweet Potato" class=mrg>
   [Red Sweet Potato; <i>C. Ipomoea batatas</i>]
   <p>
   This is not actually a yam but a sweet potato variety with red skin 
   and orange flesh. The term "Yam" was adopted from the African "nyami", 
   the name used for sweet potatoes by Southern slaves. This was to 
   differentiate it from the white sweet potato in commerce. 
   Unlike <a href="mg_mglory.html#yam">True Yams</a> they have smooth skin as other 
   sweet potatoes do.</p>
   <p>Pictured are a whole 2 pound and a cut piece from a 1/2 pound sweet 
   potato. This "Yam" has orange flesh that is moister and sweeter than 
   that of the White Sweet Potato, but all other characteristics are 
   pretty much the same.

   <br><img src="img/mg_jap02e.jpg" alt="Japanese Purple Skinned Sweet Potato" class=mrg>
   [Japanese Sweet Potato, Satsumaimo; <i>C. Ipomoea batatas</i>]
   <p>
   In North America, this sweet potato is currently sold mostly through 
   Yuppie oriented outlets like Trader Joes. They can be cooked by any 
   method used for regular North American sweet potatoes, but are a bit 
   drier, almost like a russet potato. They are quite sweet, with a 
   pleasant nutty flavor. The raw flesh is just slightly yellow, but 
   becomes more intensely yellow with cooking. They hold up fairly 
   well to wet cooking, if it's not too long. The photo specimens were 
   purchased from Trader Joe's at 2017 US $1.33 / pound. Average weight 
   was 9 ounces and 2-3/4 inches diameter, varying from almost spherical 
   to short elongated.

   [Hawaiian Sweet Potato; Uala (Hawaii); <i>C. Ipomoea batatas</i> 
    cv. <i>Ayamurasaki</i>]
    <p>
   These light beige skinned sweet potatoes were carried from the  
   American tropics to the Philippines and China by the Spanish, reaching 
   Okinawa around 1600. They are now grown on the Japanese main islands, 
   but still considered "Okinawan", with the Murasaki considered 
   "Japanese". They are quite available in Asian markets here in Los 
   Angeles, <u>always confusingly labeled</u> "Purple Yam". 
   <a href="ym_purplz.html"><b>Real Purple Yams</b></a> are not 
   currently much available in North America. The purple color comes from 
   anthocyanin flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties, but how 
   well these survive digestion is debatable.

   <p>
   These are a patented variety of Stokes Foods, organically grown under 
   contract in California and North Carolina. It is unknown where they 
   came from, but sweet potato experts are pretty sure they originated 
   from Asia. Chunks will simmer tender in 10 minutes, but start to break 
   up at 25 minutes. These are moderately sweet sweet potatoes, and their 
   flesh is a little drier than white sweet potatoes. They ares sold 
   through Whole Foods Market and other Yuppie oriented outlets, The 
   photo specimens cost 2017 US $2.49 / pound. The purple color comes 
   from anthocyanin flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties, 
   but how well these survive digestion is debatable.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Red Skinned Purple Sweet Potato</h3>
   <br><img src="img/mg_rspurp02e.jpg" alt="Red Skined Purple Sweet Potato, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>]
   <p>These resemble the Stokes Purple in many ways, but would have been 
   clearly labeled if that's what they were. They probably originated 
   from wherever the Stokes originated from. The photo specimens were 
   purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
   2019 US $1.29 / pound. The larger of them was 8-1/4 inches long, 
   3-1/4 inches diameter and wighed 1-3/4 pounds.

   <b>Purple</b> sweet potatoes are grown in much of Asia, including 
   New Zealand, Australia and Japan. Both the skin and flesh are purple, 
   and the color survives cooking. Other colors are also grown through 
   the region.</p>
   <p><b>Yellow</b> fleshed sweet potatoes with red skins are known in 
   North America as "Korean sweet potatoes", but are also grown in other 
   parts of Asia, including Japan and New Zealand. The yellow color is 
   quite bright in Korea and Japan, but very pale in Indonesia. This is 
   the most common sweet potato in China. Yellow sweet potatoes are grown 
   in Australia, but most grown there are the American orange fleshed 
   variety.</p>
   <p>New Zealand grows three varieties. A red skinned sweet potato with 
   white flesh streaked with purple is most common, but the yellow 
   fleshed and American orange fleshed are also grown.

   <p>
   What is sold as "Yam Leaves" in the markets is invariably Sweet Potato 
   Leaves, because many real Yams have somewhat toxic leaves. Sweet Potato 
   leaves are a popular green in much of the world, and they can be used as 
   a substitute    for the closely related <a href="mg_mglory.html#wspin">
   <b>Water Spinach</b></a>, which is illegal in much of North America.

   [Goguma-sun Goguma-julgi (Korea); <i>C. Ipomoea batatas</i>]
   <p>
   Use of Sweet Potato stems without the leaves is a Korean specialty. 
   Both fresh stems and dried stems are used for banchan (small side dishes). 
   The leaves are discarded and the stems are peeled, which is tedious. In 
   Korea they are also sold pre-peeled in bags of water. The season for fresh 
   stems is short, so stems are used dried the rest of the year. While cooked 
   similarly, the flavors and textures are significantly different. This is 
   not the only plant where the leaves are eaten elsewhere but only the stems 
   in Korea. &nbsp; <a href="mg_spstemz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

   <h3>Sweet Potato Starch Noodles</h3>
   <br><img src="img/pa_230sweetpot2f.jpg" alt="skein of thin noodles" class=mrg>
   [230; Dangmyeon (Korea)]
   <p>
   Instructions for these are fairly clear. Boil for 6 to 8 minutes (I 
   say more like 8 to 10 minutes), drain and refresh with cold water, 
   then mix with salad, cold dish, appetizer or as ingredient in hot pot. 
   These are essential to the famous Korean dish Japchae. The photo 
   specimens were made in China, 0.06 diameter by 22 inches folded 
   length. Ingred: sweet potato starch, sulfur dioxide, water.  They 
   cook to a firm jelly consistency. Flavor and texture are pleasant 
   and these noodles are much more durable in recipes than bean starch 
   noodles.

Convolvulus, Water Morning-glory; <i>Ipomoea aquatica</i> also 
<i>Ipomoea raptans</i> (not common in North America)]
<p>
This semi-aquatic plant is a controlled substance within the USA. 
Importing plants or seeds and/or growing plants without a permit are all 
illegal - see <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=IPAQ">
USDA Plant Profile</a>. Growing it or even transporting it is totally 
illegal in some states.</p>
<p>Here in California it is a quarantined crop but may be transported 
without a permit within the state. Enough growers have permits it is in 
good supply, and that's a good thing because if it wasn't our large Asian 
population might try sneaking it into our waterways like they did with 
snakehead fish.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of this vegetable, including a long leafed 
variety that can be grown in damp soil (Ching Quat) and a wider leafed 
variety that requires free water (Pak Quat). The wider leaf variety is 
preferred in Asia but is rarely available here, probably to keep the 
growing areas farther from our waterways. The photo specimens are about 
19 inches long.

<h2 id="yam" class=lrg>Yams</h2>

<p>These tropical vines, native to Africa and Asia, are quite unrelated 
to the Sweet Potato vines and are in the same clade as lilies (monocots). 
They produce root tubers which are generally toxic, some less so, some 
more so, but it's best to avoid eating most of them raw. Some require 
tedious pounding and leaching to make them edible but these are not 
sold as vegetables in the USA. The varieties sold here just require a 
little cooking for detox.</p>

   <p>
   True Yams are grown in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Latin 
   America, but are only beginning to take root in North America. Unlike 
   sweet potatoes they have a rough scaly skin, and can grow to as much 
   as 150 pounds, though they are generally marketed at only a few 
   pounds. Both White and Yellow varieties are native to Africa, but 
   now grown in the Tropics worldwide.

   <p>What is sold in the market as "Yam Leaves" are actually 
   <a href="mg_mglory.html#splv"><b>Sweet Potato leaves</b></a>. Real Yam Leaves are

   Mountain Yam, Chinese Yam; Ma (Korea); Shan yao, Huai shan, Huai 
   shan yao (China); <i>Dioscorea polystachya</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Southern China this yam has been cultivated in Japan from very 
   early times. Known in the U.S. mainly as an invasive weed, this vine with 
   arrowhead shaped leaves grows large tubers below ground and small tubers 
   above ground. It spreads mainly by dropping these small "air potatoes" 
   and rarely flowers.</p>
   <p>Nagaimo is roughly cylindrical and may be up to three feet long, 
   but the photo specimen was 24 inches long, 2-7/8 inches diameter and 
   weighed 3-1/4 pounds. The skin is tan and the flesh is white and, 
   unlike other yams, sticky and more than a bit slimy.  The two Japanese 
   names, nagaimo and yamaimo (shorter, thicker), are applied depending 
   on the root shape.

   <p>
   Native to Southeast Asia, there are many cultivars of this yam, 
   varying from deep purple to white. Intensely purple varieties are 
   very popular through South and Southeast Asia, while most grown 
   in Africa are white. These are the most common yam in Africa, but 
   are little available in North American markets, even in Los Angeles 
   with our large Philippine population. They are listed as noxious 
   weeds in a few southeastern states, particularly Florida. The purple 
   color comes from anthocyanin flavonoids, which have antioxidant 
   properties, but how well these survive digestion is debatable.

   <p>
   Native to the Caribbean and tropical Central America this yam is grown 
   for its starchy roots and used similarly to 
   <a href="sr_spurge.html#cassava">Cassava</a>. It contains the bitter 
   toxic alkaloid <i>discorene</i> which is eliminated by cooking.  The cut 
   ends of the photo specimens were dipped in wax to prevent drying out and 
   shriveling. The largest of the photo specimens was 11 inches long, 2-1/2 
   inches diameter and weighed 1 pound.</p>
   <p>Raw yampi are very mucilaginous but this goes away when cooked. Cooked 
   the texture and flavor are pleasant and much like a waxy potato but more 
   tender and crumbly and noticeably sweeter. While yampi is a very fine 
   edible, it is overshadowed in its growing region by manioc (cassava) which 
   produces a higher yield and is more durable in storage.
