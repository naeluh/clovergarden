<p>
These light beige skinned sweet potatoes were carried from the  
American tropics to the Philippines and China by the Spanish, reaching 
Okinawa around 1600. They are now grown on the Japanese main islands, 
but still considered "Okinawan", with the Murasaki considered 
Japanese". They are quite available in Asian markets here in Los 
Angeles, <u>always confusingly labeled</u> "Purple Yam". 
<a href="ym_purplz.html"><b>Real Purple Yams</b></a> are not 
currently much available in North America. The purple color comes from 
anthocyanin flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties, but how 
well these survive digestion is debatable.</p>

<p>Young leaves and shoots are also edible and called Kandaba in Okinawa. 
They are used in miso soups and as a vegetable side dish, or in recipes 
as are other greens.</p>

<p>This sweet potato is moderately sweet and can be used the same 
as white or orange sweet potatoes. The flesh is a bit starchy, closer 
to a real yam than most sweet potatoes.</p>

<h3>Uses:</h3> &nbsp; This sweet potato is used as an imperfect 
substitute for real Purple Yams, not as sweet or as purple. It can be 
used the same as regular sweet potatoes as a general vegetable, often 
in stews and the like, or baked whole. It is good for sweet potato 
recipes where the bright color would be a plus.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are available in Philippine markets 
and other markets serving a Southeast Asian population, always 
mislabeled as "Purple Yams".<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These will store in a cool dark place similarly 
to potatoes, for about 2 weeks.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Cooked, its purple color darkens to deep 
violet. Cut into slices or cubes, it cooks in 10 minutes and begins to 
break up at 15 minutes. Fine for baking and most other sweet potato 
uses.<p></p>
