What is sold as "Yam Leaves" in the markets is invariably Sweet Potato 
Leaves, because many real Yams have somewhat toxic leaves. Sweet Potato 
leaves are a popular green in much of the world, and they can be used as 
a substitute for the closely related <a href="mg_wspinz.html">
<b>Water Spinach</b></a>, which is illegal in much of North America, 
but the texture of the stems will be different.</p>

<p>Sweet Potatoes originated in the Americas, but are now grown worldwide. 
They are easy to grow in tropical, subtropical, and warmer temperate 
regions, with good yield, and are a major crop. Even in many growing 
regions it is not commonly known that the leaves are edible and nutritious.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California, these leaves are easy 
to find in Asian markets, particularly Philippine markets. They are sold in 
bundles "on the vine", and are always sold as "Yam Leaves".<p></p>

<h3>Yield</h3> &nbsp; A typical 14 ounce bundle will yield between 6 and 8 
ounces of leaves with stem on, depending on how much vine is included. 
Leaves without stems would be between 4.5 and 6 ounces.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; While Sweet Potato Leaves can be eaten raw, they 
are most often cooked, by blanching, steaming, stir frying, and in soup. 
In all cases, cooking of the leaves should be short, as with spinach. The 
leaf stems can be included if reasonably tender. Here are ways they are 
used in various regions, though there may be exceptions to each.

<p><b>Korea:</b>, only peeled leaf stems are used (fresh or dried) and the 
leaves are discarded (see <a href="mg_spstemz.html">
<b>Sweet Potato Stems</b></a> page).  Peeling leaf stems is very tedious.</p>

<p><b>Philippines</b> and the rest of <b>Southeast Asia:</b> the leaves are 
used whole with leaf stems left on. Salads, soups, and stir fries are popular.
</p> 

<p><b>China:</b> for soups, the stems are chopped fairly fine and the leaves 
less fine. Leaves are used whole and stem-on in stir fries.</p>

<p><b>India:</b> the leaves and leaf stems are are chopped small for 
Parippu Kootu and fine for Raita.</p>

<p><b>West, East,</b> and <b>Central Africa:</b> leaves are used without 
stems, and generally chopped medium or small. Stews are popular, served 
beside a paste made from various root vegetables - rice too, but it is 
expensive.<p></p>
