<h1>Mahogany</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Mahogany family (<i>Meliaceae</i>) is more familiar for wood used 
in boats and fine furniture than as food, but a few varieties are of 
culinary value. A number of these trees bear edible fruit, which is 
enjoyed in the regions where the trees grow, but is seldom exploited 
commercially, and even then mostly on a local scale. The photo is of 
<i>Toona ciliata</i>, also known as Australian Red Cedar (not related to 
real cedar).

[Chinese Mahogany, Red Toon; Xiang chun (China); Daaraluu (Hindi); Suren 
(Malay); Tong Du (Viet); <i>Toona sinensis</i> alt <i>Cedrela sinensis</i>]
<p>
This tree ranges from Nepal on the northwest, to Indonesia in the 
southeast and is cultivated as a vegetable, particularly in China. The 
roots, bark and fruit are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The 
flavor of young shoots reminds somewhat of onion but much less pungent. 
Varieties where the young leaves are red are considered to have better 
flavor than if they are green. This is a relatively cold tolerant 
mahogany and is farmed to some extent, even in Canada.</p>
<p>These aromatic shoots are used in stir fries, salads and particularly 
with eggs. Fresh are preferred but are very seasonal (March, April). Since 
they are so popular they are now being grown in China in greenhouses and 
plastic tunnels for year round availability. The photo specimen, purchased 
from an Asian market in Los Angeles, was preserved with salt, the form 
normally sold here. It was 9 inches long and weighed 1-3/8 ounces. &nbsp;

{flowers} (India -  Dravidian); Vempu (Tamil); Neem (Bengali); 
Mwarobaini (Swahili); <i>Azadirachta indica</i>]
<p>
This fast growing tree ranges from Persia through Southeast Asia, parts 
of Africa and has been introduced to other parts of the world. In India 
and mainland Southeast Asia, young shoots and flowers are eaten as a 
vegetable, though they are somewhat bitter, and are used in pickles. 
Throughout its range Neem is known as a most powerful medicinal plant, 
also as an insect repellant. All parts of the tree are used, and oil 
from the seeds is used in cosmetics.

<h2>Lanzones</h2>
<br><img src="img/mh_lanzo04e.jpg" alt="Bunch of Lanzone Fruit" class=mrg>
[Lanzon, Lanzones (Philippine); Lansones, Buwa-buwa (Tagalog); 
Lanzones, Langsat (English); Langsad (Thai langsat), Longkong 
(Thai duku); Dua da dot, Lon bon, Bon bon (Viet); Long kong (Cambodia); 
<i>Lansium parasiticum</i> syn. <i>Lansium domesticum</i>]
<p>
Native to Southeast Asia, this large mahogany tree bears edible fruit of 
some popularity in its native region. The fruit contains 4 or 5 
translucent wedge shaped jelly-like arils with a pleasant flavor quite 
similar to pink grapefruit, but a little lighter. Some arils may contain 
a flat bitter seed in their center, but most have undeveloped seeds. 
There are three common varieties, <i>Duku</i>, large with thick rind, 
<i>Langsat</i>, large with thin rind, and <i>Auaeum</i>, small with 
tough rind and sour arils surrounding large seeds. There are also 
Duku-Langsat hybrids. The Duku bears bunches with only a few fruits, so 
the commercial products are Langsat.</p>
<p>The photo specimens, previously frozen, were from Thailand, purchased 
from a large Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). They were up 
to 1.37 inches diameter, and would have been much lighter and yellower in 
color if they were fresh rather than frozen. This is an "eat out of hand" 
sort of fruit and quite easy to peel. Yield was a decent 51% edible, so 
at 2015 US $1.79 per pound they were only moderately expensive, compared 
to some exotic imported fruits. The soft bitter green seeds can be up to 
0.47 inch across, but most will be undeveloped and almost non-existent.

<h2>Santol</h2>
<br><img src="img/mh_santol01h.jpg" alt="Stack of Santol Fruit" class=mrg>
[Santol (Filipino); Lanzones, Langsat (English); Krathon, Sathon (Thai); 
Iecapi, Sentul, Ketuat (Indonesia); <i>Sandoricum koetjape</i>]
<p>
Native to the Southeast Asian Peninsula, this large mahogany tree is now 
cultivated throughout Southeast Asia and parts of India. Only a few 
specimen trees are grown outside the region because even southern Florida 
gets too cold. There are two varieties, red and yellow, both producing 
fruit that, when cut, looks a lot like a Mangosteen (not related). Mature 
fruits are fairly large, up to about 3-1/2 inches diameter.</p>
<p>The pulpy white arils surrounding the inedible seeds may be sweet or 
sour. The arils may be eaten raw, or cooked, and are sometimes candied or 
made into marmalade. It is unsafe to swallow the seeds as they have 
caused intestinal blockage. Unripe Santols can be grated and used as 
unripe papayas are to make salads popular in Thailand. They are also 
often cooked in the unripe state in the Philippines.

<h2>Langsatan</h2>
<br><img src="img/mh_lsatan01h.jpg" alt="Illustration of Langsatan" class=mrg>
[Gumi {fruit}; <i>Aglaia edulis</i>]
<p>
This tree,  native to Southeast Asia, is one of a number of mahogany 
trees that produce edible fruit eaten locally. It grows throughout Southeast 
Asia and in the West Indies. The translucent or light brown fruit aril (pulp 
surrounding the seeds) is eaten in the regions where it grows wild, but it 
is not much cultivated anywhere. It is said to be succulent, cooling and 
pleasant. The brown to reddish fruit is elliptical about 2.1 x 1.4 inches 
with a single large elliptical seed, but shape varies. The fruit grows in 
looser clusters than most mahogany fruit. &nbsp; <small>
