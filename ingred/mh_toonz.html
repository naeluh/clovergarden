(Malay); Tong Du (Viet); <i>Toona sinensis</i> alt <i>Cedrela sinensis</i>]
<p>
This tree ranges from Nepal on the northwest to Indonesia in the southeast 
and is cultivated as a vegetable, particularly in China. The roots, bark and 
fruit are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The flavor of young shoots 
reminds somewhat of onion but much less pungent. Varieties where the young 
leaves are red are considered to have better flavor than if they are green. 
This is a relatively cold tolerant mahogany and is farmed to some extent 
even in Canada.</p>
<p>These aromatic shoots are used in stir fries, salads and particularly 
with eggs. Fresh are preferred but are very seasonal (March, April). Since 
they are so popular they are now being grown in China in greenhouses and 
plastic tunnels for year round availability. The photo specimen, purchased 
from an Asian market in Los Angeles, was preserved with salt, the form 
normally sold here. It was 9 inches long and weighed 1-3/8 ounces.</p>

The photo to the left shows a mature leaf stem, and an immature (edible) 
one at its base. The stem in this photo is considered unusual because it 
has a terminal leaflet - most stems have a pair of leaflets at the end.

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; The only way I've 
seen this sold in Los Angeles so far is flat trays of salted shoots 
sealed in a plastic bag - but I wouldn't be surprised if it's also 
available frozen and/or brined. I understand some people in California 
have trees planted in their back yards. While the seasonal shoot clusters 
are sold commercially, individual young leaves can also be picked for use 
all year.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The salted variety is easy, just make sure the 
bag is tightly sealed so they don't dry out, which would ruin the flavor.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Salted Toon is quite salty, so soak it in cold water 
for an hour or so before using.
