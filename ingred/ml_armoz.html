<h1>Armenian Cucumber</h1>

[Snake Melon, Snake Cucumber;  Uri (Japan), Metki,  Mikti (Near East), 
Wild Cucumber (commercial), <i>Cucumis melo</i> var. <i>flexuosus</i>]
<p>
These melons, along with the closely related Chate Melons were popular 
in Ancient Egypt thousands of years ago, and are featured in many toumb 
paintings. They traveled from there into the Levant - or vice versa. 
Many researchers hold melons to have originated in Western Asia, but 
others think they originated in Africa.</p>

<p>Market size for these melons varies widely, from 6 inches long and 1-1/4 
inches diameter to 21 inches long and 2-1/2 inches diameter but they 
can grow to a yard long and over 3 inches in diameter. When raw, they 
are very much like cucumbers in structure and taste. The skin is very 
thin and tender and is almost never peeled. Smaller sizes are often 
pickled and the resulting pickles have a rather different flavor from 
cucumber pickles.</p> 
<p>Armenian cucumbers are seasonally available fresh in Southern 
California (May to July) and are grown as a garden vegetable in Florida 
and other suitable regions, but I understand they're almost impossible 
to find fresh in Armenia. Pickled they can be found in any market 
serving a Western Asian or Near Eastern community. They're usually 
packed in Lebanon or surrounding regions and labeled "Mikti" or "Wild 
Cucumber". The front photo specimen was 12 inches long (uncut), 2 
inches diameter and weighed 14-5/8 ounces. The middle one was 14-1/2 
inches long (if straight) 1-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 10-1/8 
ounces.</p>

<p>These melons are often used raw in salads as cucumbers would be used. The 
skin is extremely thin and is almost never peeled.</p>

Melons chosen for pickles are generally around 6-1/2 inches long by 3/4 inch 
in diameter, as are the photo specimens from Lebanon. Some brands choose 
slightly larger melons and cut off the tips to fit the jar. The flavor is 
sharp and more minerally than cucumber pickles.
