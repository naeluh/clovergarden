[Agusi, Agushi; <i>Citrullus lanatus</i> -or-  <i>Citrullus 
colocynthis</i>]
<p>
This product is made from the seeds of a variety of watermelon and used 
throughout the countries of West Africa. The seeds are toasted, shelled 
and ground. It is a popular thickner for stews and soups throughout 
the region, including Egusi Soup. This thickner is gluten free.</p>
<p>Many sources list these seeds coming from <i>C. colocynthis</i>, but 
that seems unlikely. Though <i>C. Colocynthis</i> seeds have been ground 
into flour by Berbers, it is adapted to very arid regions and doesn't 
grow much south of the Sahara. More likely is a wild variety of 
<i>C. lanatus</i>, group <i>Vulgaris</i>, related to the domesticated 
watermelon, as these are native to West Africa.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; In North America, prepared and ground Egusi 
is available on-line, and probably in a few markets specializing in 
African foods. The photo specimen was from Jeb Foods.<p></p>

<h3>Substitutes:</h3> &nbsp; Other seeds of family <i>Cucurbitaceae</i> 
can be toasted, shelled and ground. Mexican Pepitas are quite available 
and can be used. Easiest to buy them already shelled, toasting them 
lightly before cooling and grinding in a food processor.<p></p>
