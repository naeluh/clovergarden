<h1>"Tuscan Style Cantaloupe"</h1>

<p>
This melon is a specialty of Dulcinea Farms, a large melon grower in 
California. It is deeply sutured like an Eastern Muskmelon, but has the 
fine mesh pattern and excellent shipping properties of a Western 
Muskmelon. The Tuscan is a beautiful melon to look at -  right up to the 
point when it is fully ripe - then it becomes as grungy as shown the 
photo.</p>

<p>The photo specimen weighed just over 6 pounds and was 8 inches long 
and 6-1/2 inches in diameter. It was eaten the day after this photo was 
taken and was perfectly ripe and delicious.</p>

<p>When properly ripened this melon is very sweet - right out to the rind, 
and has excellent muskmelon flavor. The flesh is thick and the seed cavity 
small. Even better, the flesh is still fairly firm and of quite even 
texture from center to rind making it excellent for dicing in fruit 
salads and the like. It is completely ripe when the green color in the 
sutures starts to fade and become uneven. The flower end will also have 
a fair amount of give and it will have a distinct muskmelon aroma. Be 
aware that fruit flies are as enthusiastic about this melon as I am.

This photo shows a "Tuscan Style Cantaloupe" as you will find them in 
stores. It has not yet reached optimum ripeness but it looks real nice 
and is very firm for shipping. Leave it lie around on the kitchen floor 
for awhile until it looks something like the photo at the top. Yum!
