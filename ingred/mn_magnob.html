<h1>Basal Angiosperms</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>While we know a lot more than we did when Darwin called the sudden 
appearance of well developed flowering plants the "abominable mystery", 
their exact ancestors have still not been identified. They probably 
developed from some variety of <a href="pt_misc.html">Seed Fern</a>, 
possibly from something like <i>Gigantopterids</i>, and some form of 
flowers may have appeared as much as 250 million years ago. Given how 
fast angiosperms evolved, there may be scant fossil evidence.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>Here we take a look at those living plants considered, due to 
primitive features, to have diverged from the main Angiosperm stem 
previously to the major clades.</span>

   <p>
   This shrub is found only on Grande Terre, the main island of 
   New Caledonia. It is not edible, but is of great interest to botanists 
   because it is considered the living plant closest to the origin of 
   all the flowering plants.

   [Bat Gok (China); Badiyan (from Persian, but adopted by other 
   languages); <i>Illicium verum</i>]
   <p>
   This is an essential flavoring spice for Chinese cooking, and also 
   used in Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, and India. These licorice flavored 
   seed pods grow on a tree native to Vietnam and southern China. For 
   details of culinary usage, see our 
   <a href="sp_staraz.html"><b>Star Anise</b></a> page.</p>
   <p>In the early 2000s, most of the harvest went to processors for 
   extraction of a chemical used in manufacturing the controversial 
   drug Tamiflu&reg;. This has caused shortages, but by 2006 production 
   of that chemical by a bacterial method was ramping up.</p>
   <p>There are a number of other species of <i>Illicium</i> with similar 
   pods, including two in the southeastern United States, but they are 
   all highly toxic.

   <p>
   These climbing vines, native to the forests of Northern China and the 
   Russian Far East, bear tiny white magnolia-like flowers. They are 
   mainly known as powerful medicinals, particularly for improving 
   stamina, but their berries have other uses as well. The Chinese name
   wu w&eacute;i zi means Five Flavor Berry, because it includes all 
   five basic flavors: salty, sweet, sour, pungent and bitter.</p>	 
   <p>In China the berries are made into a wine, and in Korea they are 
   used to make a bright pink-red tea. In the Russian Far East many tons 
   of berries are processed into juices, wines, extracts, and sweets.

   the berries are edible, raw or cooked.	 No fruit will be set unless 
   both male and female plants are in the garden. The plant is evergreen 
   and available with dark green or variegated leaves.

<h2 class=lrg id="nymph">Nymphaeales - Order</h2>
<p>This order contains three families of aquatic plants, some of which 
have culinary uses. They have left ample fossil evidence since the 
Cretaceous, possibly as far back as 112 million years. The order 
contains 11 genera and between 70 and 90 species.

   [Ch&uacute;n c&agrave;i (China); Junsai (Japan); <i>Annonaceae</i> 
   of family <i>Cabombaceae</i>]
   <p>
   This water plant is native to North America, northern South America, 
   East Asia and India. Flowering is interesting. On the first day the 
   flower stalks extend out of the water bearing female flowers. At the 
   end of the day the stalk withdraws, and on the following day it 
   extends again with male flowers. This plant is cultivated in China, 
   and is used in the popular Hangzhou dish "West Lake Water Shield Soup".

   [genus <i>Nymphaea</i> (more than 35 species) of family 
   <i>Nymphaeaceae</i>]
   <p>
   Water lilies are native to the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and 
   Australia. While some are called "Lotus", they are not at all related 
   to the true <a href="pr_proteus.html#lotus">Lotus</a> (genus 
   <i>Nelumbo</i>). The two are actually easy to tell apart. Water lily 
   leaves float on the surface and generally have a deep notch, usually 
   extending in to the leaf stem. Lotus leaves are held above the water 
   and are completely circular with a central stem (no notch). Lotus also 
   has a wide conical seed capsule often seen in dried flower 
   arrangements.</p>
   <p>Young leaves and flower buds can be cooked and eaten. The seeds 
   are nutritious, high in starch, protein and oil. They can be roasted 
   and popped, or ground into flour.</p>
   <p>The Egyptian Blue Water Lily (Egyptian Blue Lotus; <i>Nymphaea 
   caerulea</i>) flowers have a lightly psychoactive effect, mainly as 
   a sedative. Petals and whole flowers of this plant are used to make 
   teas and to flavor wine and martinis. One species, <i>Nymphaea 
   odorata</i> subsp. <i>tuberosa</i>, native to the southeastern United 
   States, produces potato-like tubers which can be cooked and eaten.

   [Gorgon Nut; Makhana (Hindi/Punjabi); Makhana, Nikori (Assam); Onibas, 
   Onibasu (Japan); <i>Euryale ferox</i> of family <i>Nymphaeaceae</i>]
   <p>
   Seeds of this plant have been used as human food since at least 
   750,000 years ago. They are currently an important crop in India and 
   China, and also used in Korea, Japan and the Russian Far East. The 
   pads, which can grow to more than 3 feet across, are green and spiky 
   on top, purple on the bottom.</p>
   <p> In northern India, the seeds are collected in the late summer and 
   early autumn. They may be eaten raw or cooked, and are often roasted 
   and popped for use as a snack. They may be ground into flour used to 
   make a porridge called <i>makhane ki kheer</i> which is often 
   presented as a religious offering. In China the seeds are used in 
   medicinal soups which are supposed to improve male potency and 
   retard aging. In India, a technique for growing this plant as a field 
   crop has recently been developed.

   [<i>Victoria amazonica</i>, <i>Victoria cruziana</i>, 
   <i>Victoria mattogrossensis</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South American river basins, these water lily have striking 
   rimmed floating leaves sometimes exceeding 9 feet across. 
   <i>V. amzonica</i> is native to the Amazon basin of Brazil and the 
   only slightly smaller <i>V. cruziana</i> is native to the 
   Paran&aacute; river basin of Paraguay. <i>V. mattogrossensis</i> is 
   almost identical to <i>V. cruziana</i> but has larger seeds and lives 
   in the  Pantanal wetlands of central South America. I have not seen 
   any references to using the seeds as food, but know of no evidence 
   that they haven't been. These plants are very popular in botanical 
   gardens.
