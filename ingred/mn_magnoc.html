<h1>Magnoliids - Clade</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<i>Magnoliids</i> is the smallest and most archaic of the three great 
"clades" of flowering plants. These plants display characteristics of 
some of the very earliest flowering plants. The clade contains only four 
modest sized orders, but all four orders are of great culinary interest, 
particularly as spices and flavorings, but some produce very desirable 
fruit as well. Many members of the clade are strongly medicinal, and 
some are psychoactive.

<h2>Piperales - Order</h2>
<br><a href="pi_piper.html">
<img src="img/pi_black01k.jpg" alt="Colored Leaves" class=mrg></a>
The order <i>Piperales</i> contains five families, but only two,  
the Pepper family (<i>Piperaceae</i>) and the Lizard Tail family  
(<i>Saururaceae</i>) provide anything of culinary interest, so those 
are the only ones we will cover here.  The 
<a href="pi_piper.html"><b>Pepper Order</b></a> has it's own page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<br>

<h2>Laurales - Order</h2>
<br><a href="laurel.html">
<img src="img/ll_mix03k.jpg" alt="Various Laurels" class=mrg></a>
The order <i>Laurales</i> contains seven families, but only one, 
the Laurel Family provides much of culinary interest, so we are 
lumping family <i>Gomortegaceae</i>, which has only one species, in with 
the Laurels. The 
<a href="laurel.html"><b>Laurel Family</b></a> has it's own page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<br>

<h2>Magnoliales - Order</h2>
<br>This order contains six families. We have split two families out 
into separate pages because the culinary usage is so different from 
each other.

   [Genus <i>Magnolia</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Genus <i>Liriodendron</i> 
   (Tulip Trees) &nbsp; - &nbsp; both of Family <i>Magnoliaceae</i>]
   <p>
   Formerly giving the name <i>Magnoliophyta</i> to all the flowering plants 
   (recently renamed to <i>Angiosperms</i>), Magnolias are a very ancient 
   line. All the flowering plants we depend on for food and flavorings are 
   thought to descend from a primitive Magnolia, but the Magnolia itself 
   is noted mainly for popular decorative flowering trees. Some also provide 
   high quality wood, and medicinals, but culinary usage is local.

   This family includes a number of important tropical fruits native to 
   North, Central and South America, though some are now grown in 
   Southeast Asia.  The

   <br><a href="mn_nutmeg.html">
   <img src="img/mn_nutmeg00c.jpg" alt="Nutmeg Drawing" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Myristicaceae</i>]
   <p>
   The Nutmeg Family has over 440 species in about 20 genera, but our 
   listing is not large. I'm sure there are many more species with 
   culinary value, but my primary information comes from botanists, who
   could care less about culinary or any other uses - they're interested 
   in identification and naming.</p>
   <p>We include on this page also the family <i>Eupomatiaceae</i>, a 
   family of only four known species, only one of which has culinary 
   value.

   [Native Guava, Copper Laurel; <i>Eupomatia laurina</i> of family 
   <i>Eupomatiaceae</i>]
   <p>
   These large shrubs are native to Eastern Australia and New Guinea, 
   living in rainforests or humid eucalyptus forests.  They produce 
   urn shaped yellow fruit about 0.8 inches in diameter. The fruit 
   contains an edible jelly with many edible seeds, similar in effect 
   to guavas, thus one of its names. The fruit has a strong spicy 
   flavor, so is most often combined with other fruits to make jams, 
   deserts and beverages. These shrubs are cultivated on a small scale 
   for their fruits.

<h2>Canellales - Order</h2>
<br>This Order contains only two families, <i>Canellaceae</i> and 
<i>Winteraceae</i>. Both provide spicy seasonings and both are of 
considerable medicinal interest. Winteraceae are southern hemisphere 
plants that are part of the "Antarctic Flora" from when Antarctica 
was warm and before the continents broke apart.<p></p>

   [Cinnamon bark, Wild cinnamon; <i>Canella winterana</i> of family 
   <i>Canellaceae</i>]
   <p>
   This tree is native to the Caribbean region from the Florida Keys to 
   Barbados. Its aromatic bark is used in the same way as Old World 
   Cinnamon. Commercial production of White Cinnamon has ended, but 
   local production continues. This tree is also a popular decorative 
   in the region.

   (Venda); Isibaha (Zulu); <i>Warburgia salutaris</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   also Ugandan Greenheart; <i>Warburgia ugandensis</i>; both of family 
   <i>Canellaceae</i>]
   </p><p>
   Both these Trees are native to Subsaharan Africa, with the Pepper-bark 
   more widely spread. The leaves of both have been used to provide a 
   sharp peppery flavor to food and teas. The Greenheart was particularly 
   used by Indian immigrants building railroads in Kenya to add sharpness 
   to their curries until chili plants became widely available there.
   While they are very hot, the flavor is somewhat different from chilis.
   </p>
   <p>Extracts from the bark of both trees have shown antimalarial, 
   antifungal, and antibacterial properties and have long been used 
   as medicinals in the region, to the point of being over harvested.

   [Mountain Horopito, Pepperwood; <i>Pseudowintera colorata</i> of 
   family <i>Winteraceae</i>]
   <p>
   This tree is native to New Zealand. It has primitive characteristics 
   indicating it is one of the earliest flowering plants. The spicy hot 
   leaves of this tree have become a common spice in New Zealand, usually 
   dried and powdered, and used similarly to black pepper. It has long 
   been used as a medicinal, both by the native Maori and European 
   Settlers.  &nbsp; <small>Photo by Peganum distributed under license

   [Mountain Pepper; <i>Tasmannia lanceolata</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; also 
   Dorrigo Pepper; <i>Tasmannia stipitata</i> - both of family 
   <i>Winteraceae</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Australia, these "peppercorns" look much like dried black 
   peppercorns but have a pungency and numbing effect on the tongue 
   similar to Sichuan peppercorns. Both dried berries and dried leaves 
   carry the spiciness and both are used in cooking, usually dried and 
   powdered. This plant is grown commercially in Australia and some is 
   exported to Japan to be used to flavor wasabe paste (whether real 
   wasabe or the horseradish paste also called "wasabe" I do not know). 
   Both leaves and berries also show strong antimicrobial activity and 
   are high in antioxidants.
