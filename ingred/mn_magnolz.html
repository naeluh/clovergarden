<h1>Magnolias &amp; Tulip Trees</h1>
<br><img src="img/mn_magnol01f.jpg" alt="Magnolia Flower" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Magnolia</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Genus <i>Liriodendron</i> 
(Tulip Trees) &nbsp; - &nbsp; both of Family <i>Magnoliaceae</i>]
<p>
Magnolias are a very ancient line and are thought to be the first fully 
developed flowering land plants from which all others descend. The 
flowering plants we depend on for food and flavorings were formerly given  
the name <i>Magnoliophyta</i>, but in the era of the AGP they have been 
renamed to <i>Angiosperms</i>.</p>
<p>The Magnolias themselves are noted mainly for popular decorative 
flowering trees. Some also provide high quality wood, and medicinals, 
but culinary usage is very local. There are at least 254 species in this 
genus.</p>

The photo to the left is of mature Magnolia Fruits (<i>M. grandiflora</i>) 
that have developed from the central spike in the flowers. The fruit is very 
hard, and the central flower spike that develops into the fruit is also quite 
hard. The Magnolias developed long before there were bees, and depended on 
beetles for fertilization. The beetles were much more interested in eating 
the flowers than fertilizing them, so the flowers had to be tough. The photo 
specimen was picked up after a wind storm in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Japan:</h3> &nbsp; Flower buds and young leaves of <i>M. hypoleuca</i> 
and <i>M. obovata</i> are cooked as a vegetable, while older leaves are 
ground to a powder as a seasoning.  Whole dried leaves are also used as 
dishes to hold a stuffing for broiling. One variety of Miso (hoba miso) is 
flavored with Magnolia.<p></p>

<h3>Asia:</h3> &nbsp; Magnolia flower buds are used to flavor rice and and 
scent tea.<p></p>

<h3>China:</h3> &nbsp; Dried buds and petals of <i>M. biondii</i> are used 
as flavorings in some regions. Fresh flower buds are pickled with vinegar 
and ginger. Fresh petals are coated with a flour batter and deep fried.
<p></p>

<h3>Mexico, Central America:</h3> &nbsp; The main uses of <i>M. mexicana</i> 
are medicinal, but fresh flowers are also used in culinary preparations, and 
fresh leaves are used as a flavoring.<p></p>

<h3>England:</h3> &nbsp; Magnolias have been imported from North America. 
Petals of <i>M. grandiflora</i> are pickled and used as a spicy condiment.

<h2>Tulip Tree</h2>
<p><img src="img/mn_tulip01d.jpg" alt="Tulip Tree Flowers and Leaves" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Liriodendron</i> of Family <i>Magnoliaceae</i>]</p>
<p>The Tulip Tree flowers are structured just like the Magnolia flowers, with a 
similar central spike that develops into the fruit. To the best of my 
knowledge no part of the Tulip Tree is eaten, but the fine grained wood is 
quite liked and sold as "Yellow Poplar". The photo was taken in New Jersey, 
USA where Tulip Trees are native, but they have been introduced as far as 
Oregon.
