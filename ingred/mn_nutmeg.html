<p>The Nutmeg Family (<i>Myristicaceae</i>) of order 
<i>Magnoliales</i> has over 440 species in about 20 genera, but our 
listing here is not large. I'm sure there are many more species with 
culinary value, but my primary information comes from botanists, who 
could care less about culinary or any other uses - they're interested 
in identification and naming. Most members of the family are strongly 
medicinal and/or psychoactive.</p>
<p>We include on this page also the family <i>Eupomatiaceae</i>, a 
family of only four known species, only one of which has culinary value.

Less important than it was in Medieval times, nutmeg is still used in many 
European recipes, particularly in sauces and beverages, but also in baked 
goods and with vegetables. Mace is a wrapper around the nutmeg seed which 
is treated separately. Mace has a lighter, more fruity flavor while nutmeg 
is sweeter and stronger, so they find application in different kinds of 
recipes (and sometimes together). The fruit itself is also used in the 
regions where nutmeg grows.
&nbsp; <a href="sp_nutmegz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>
<p>Nutmeg is known to have psychoactive properties, and some nutmeg 
relatives in South America have very strong psychoactive properties, 
but these are not relevant to a culinary site. Nutmeg is so highly 
toxic to some animals, dogs, for instance, that culinary quantities 
harmless to people can be deadly.

This intensely aromatic spice is from trees native to swampy areas 
along the Western Ghats (mountain range) of India, and used in 
masalas (spice mixtures) in the region, particularly Karala. The 
appearance is much like Mace, but much larger and more dense. The 
aroma and flavor are much darker and less fruity than mace.	 The trees 
are Red List VU (Vulnerable) due to draining of the marshes in which 
they live for agriculture. The photo specimens, up to 2.4 inches long, 
were purchased from an export house in India for 2014 US $9.99 / 50 
grams (1-3/4 ounce).

Trees of the Virola genus, native to the tropics of Central and South 
America, bear fruits very much like nutmegs, including the mace-like red 
wrapper around the pit. They smell similar to nutmeg, but I've found no 
evidence either the wrapper or pit are used as a spice. These trees are 
noted mainly for intense psychoactive properties, use by shamans and 
spiritual seekers throughout the region. The pits of some species are used 
industrially to extract oil similar to cocoa butter, used to make soap 
and candles. The photo is of Virola sebifera, popular for both uses.

This small tree (up to 20 feet high) native to the far northeast of India 
(Assam)	and nearby regions, produces fruit the kernel of which is used 
as a substitute for betel nut in the Paan chew. It is mildly intoxicating 
to humans, but probably no more dangerous than betel nut. The fruit 
surrounding the kernel is very much liked by imperial pigeons.

This small tree (up to 16 feet high) native to eastern Australia and 
New Guinea, produces yellow fruit about 3/4 inch diameter filled with an 
edible jelly embedded with inedible seeds, looking similar to a guava. 
The fruit is sweet, aromatic and spicy, used in cooking beverages, jams 
and deserts. Because if it's strong flavor, it is categorized as a spice 
in Australia.
