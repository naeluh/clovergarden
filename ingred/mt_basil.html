<span class=bg>
Basils (genus <i>Ocimum</i> of family <i>Lamiaceae</i> alt <i>Labiatae</i> 
(the mint family) of order <i>Lamiales</i> are a worldwide family 
consisting almost entirely of small herbs. Even the one exception 
reaches only 10 feet. Many of these herbs have important culinary uses. 
Most basils are annuals, but African basils are perenials.</span>

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Basils are a major sub-tribe of the mints, probably originating in 
Africa but first cultivated in India. Varieties of these aromatic plants 
are now grown worldwide, particularly in Southeast Asia, Mediterranean 
countries and California.</p>
<p>Classifying basils is difficult even for botanists because they are highly 
promiscuous and cross breed with abandon, even from one species to another. 
Many species have a half dozen or more "scientific" names and cultivars of 
the same species may vary in shape and color.</p><br>

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Italian Basil</h2> 
<br><img src="img/mt_basilital08k.jpg" alt="Growing Italian Basil plant" class=mrg>
[Sweet Basil, Genovese Basil, Mediterranean Basil; 
<i>Ocimum basilicum</i>]
<p>
This Basil is universally called for in European and American recipes. 
It is more aromatic and less sharp than <a href="mt_basiltz.html">Thai 
Purple Basil</a>, but the two are reasonably interchangeable. I have 
been known to make Italian pesto using Thai basil because I can get it 
at a fraction of the price for Italian.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Purple Basil</h2>
<br><img src="img/mt_basilpurp02k.jpg" alt="Growing Purple Basil plants" class=mrg>
[Opal Basil; <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>]
<p>
Purple basil ranges from purple splotches on green leaves to deep dark 
purple with almost no green. It is fairly closely related to Italian 
basil but not as usable for many recipes because of its color. It is, 
however, very good in salads and for applications where color is not 
critical. It should not be confused with Thai Purple Basil (see below) 
which is mostly green with purple stems and has a somewhat different 
flavor. Opal (deep purple) basil is the preferred basil for Georgian 
cuisine.</p>
<p><b>Growing:</b> &nbsp; Purple basil is more resistant to fusarium wilt 
than Italian basil but may be somewhat stunted by it.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="thai"><u>Thai Basils</u></h2>
<p>These basils have become quite important in some parts of North 
America, particularly Southern California, where there are large Thai 
and Vietnamese communities, as well as a general enthusiasm for Thai 
cuisine.</p>

   <h3>Thai Purple Basil</h3>
   <br><a href="mt_basiltz.html">
   <img src="img/mt_basilthaip05e.jpg" alt="Leafy sprigs of Thai Purple Basil" class=mrg></a>
   [Bai Horapha (Thai); Rau Que, Hung Que (Viet); Pak Boualapha, Pak 
   Boula Phe (Laos); Anise Basil; <i>Ocimum basilicum</i> var 
   <i>thyrsiflora</i>]
   <p>
   Now quite common in Southern California, this basil has good flavor 
   and reasonable keeping properties (almost a week if very fresh and 
   treated carefully). 
   In general the leaves are dark green with only a hint of purple, and the 
   stems are distinctly purple but there are also all-green varieties. 
   Of the Asian basils, this one is closest to 
   <a href="mt_basiliz.html">Italian Basil</a> but is sharper, 
   slightly sweeter, and with a more anise-like flavor. They can 
   substitute for each other in a pinch. I've even used Thai Purple 
   Basil to make Italian Pesto because I can get piles of it cheap 
   at ethnic markets, while Italian Basil can cost several dollars 
   an ounce in the supermarkets.

   <h3>Thai Lemon Basil / Lao Basil</h3> 
   <br><a href="mt_basillz.html">
   <img src="img/mt_basillemon08h.jpg" alt="Leafy sprigs of Thai Lemon Basil" class=mrg></a> 
   [Bai Maeng-lak (Thai); Pak i tou (Laos); Sangig (Philippines); 
   Kemangi (Indonesia); <i>Ocimum x africanum</i> alt <i>Ocimum x 
   citriodorum</i>]
   <p>
   This is one of the basils that has become common in Southern California, 
   often labeled "Thai Basil". It is characterized by a citrus fragrance, 
   smaller light green pointed leaves and a relatively light flavor - 
   and bad keeping properties (maybe 3 days if you take good care of it). 
   It often alternates with <a href="mt_basil.html#bastp">Thai Purple Basil</a> 
   in the markets. The stronger more aromatic flavor of the purple is better 
   for most Thai cooking while the Lemon Basil is used mainly for salads and 
   some soups.	 <a href="mt_basillz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Holy Basil</h3> 
   <br><a href="mt_basilhz.html">
   <img src="img/mt_basilholy06e.jpg" alt="Leafy sprigs of Holy Basil" class=mrg></a>
   [Tulsi (india); Krapao (Thai); Pak Kapow, Bai Supow, Pak i tou Tai 
   (Laos); Humong Basil (Calif.); Hot Basil <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> 
   (Mint family)]
    <p>
    In India this basil is highly revered and used for religious 
   purposes and in Ayurvedic medicine. In Thailand and Vietnam it is used as 
   a culinary herb. Unlike other basils it is always cooked, not used raw or 
   just warmed. There are two basic varieties, one with purplish green leaves 
   and purple stems (called purple), the other is all green (called white). 
   Unlike other basils the leaf margins are strongly serrated, the leaves are 
   slightly fuzzy and the stems are definitely fuzzy. It has very poor keeping 
   qualities, if it's really fresh when you buy it you may get 2 days. Holy 
   Basil has a strong flavor that is sharper and more minty than other 
   basils, and with a hint of camphor.

   [Takmaria, Tukmaria sabja, Subja, Falooda (India); 
   <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>]
   <p>
   Basil seeds have a coating on them that becomes gelatinous 
   when soaked overnight in water. This feature is exploited in a number 
   of drinks throughout South and Southeast Asia, particularly India and 
   Thailand. The seeds provide texture and do not have much of a basil 
   flavor. Basil seeds are also used in traditional and Ayurvedic medicine. 
   As the photo specimens show, these seeds are very small, less than 
   1 mm long.

<h2 id="afrib">African Basil</h2>
<br><img src="img/mt_basilaf01h.jpg" alt="Flowering African Basil Plant" class=mrg>
[Wild Basil, <i>Ocimum canum</i>, also <i>Ocimum kilimandscharicum</i>]
<p>
A perennial basil grown in Africa and recently brought to Europe 
but not yet popular in North America. It's flavor is strong but less 
pleasant than that of Thai Purple Basil. In Europe it is being used to 
produce interesting hybrids with Mediterranean basil. From the ads on 
the Internet I gather <i>O. canum</i> has widespread medicinal and 
magical uses.

<h2>African Blue Basil</h2> 
<br><img src="img/mt_basilafb04h.jpg" alt="Flowering Blue Basil Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Ocimum kilimandscharicum</i> x <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>]
<p>
This is a pernneial hybrid between an African and a European basil and 
is now widely sold by herb vendors here in Southern California. 
It flowers profusely, but is sterile so no seeds are produced. For 
greater production of leaves, flower heads should be cut off regularly. 
This basil has found use more as a decorative than as a culinary herb 
because it's not a good replacement for Italian basil, Thai basil or 
Holy basil due to its high camphor content. This makes the flavor 
significantly different. It may be good as an herb used with beef, 
lamb or goat dishes - I haven't tried that yet.

<h2 id="beso">Besobela</h2>
<br><a href="mt_besobz.html">
<img src="img/mt_besob02e.jpg" alt="Dried Besobela" class=mrg></a>
[Beso Bela; Ethiopian Sacred Basil; <i>Ocimum sanctum?</i>]
<p>This plant is native to Ethiopia and has important uses in Ethiopian and 
Eritrean cuisines. It is said to be a variety of Tulsi (South and Southeast 
Asian "Sacred Basil").

<h2>Tree Basil</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  
<br><img src="img/mt_basiltree01h.jpg" alt="Growing Tree Basil Plants" class=mrg>
[African Basil, Clove basil Wild Basil (Hawaii); Horapha-chang (Thai); 
East Indian Basil (Filipino); <i>Ocimum gratissimum</i>]
<p>
This tropical basil grows wild in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia and 
Hawaii. The leaves have a very intense flavor of cloves, so intense just 
a couple of leaves in the pot is sufficient. It is said to be particularly 
good for use with meats cooked in red wine. This basil is a perennial 
and far larger than other basils, growing as high as 10 feet.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Recent research has shown that the essential oils contained in basil 
have strong antioxidant, anti-cancer, antiviral and anti-microbial 
properties. Some experiments have shown a potential for decreasing 
blood platelet aggregation.</p>

<p>Tulsi (Holy Basil) is very much used in India as a medicinal to treat 
everything from common colds to heart disease. Recent research has shown 
it to be useful in treatement of type 2 diabetes and to reduce blood 
cholesterol levels. High in antioxidants, it is thought to have potential 
for treatment of radiation sickness and to reduce formation of 
cataracts.</p>

<p>Basil contains the known carcinogen estragole, but researchers estimate it 
would take between 100 and 1000 times the normal culinary usage to produce a 
statistically measurable increase in cancer risk.</p>
