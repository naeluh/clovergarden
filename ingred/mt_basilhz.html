In India Holy basils are highly revered, used for religious purposes 
and in Ayurvedic medicine. In Thailand they are used as a culinary 
herb, but unlike other basils, are always cooked, not used raw or just 
warmed. The terms Holy Basil and Tulsi are quite confusing as there 
are a number of rather different varieties, green (white), purple and 
in between. Unlike other basils the leaf margins can be strongly 
serrated, the leaves slightly fuzzy and the stems definitely fuzzy. 
They have very poor keeping qualities. The slightly rumpled photo 
specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The three "recognized" varieties are Krishna (mostly to all 
purple), Vana, Sri or Lakshmi (green) and Rama (green with purple 
stems and veins). Rama, an annual, is the one most commonly found 
from herb vendors in North America. Vana (green) which grows wild 
in Southeast Asia is the one used in Thai cuisine.

The photo to the left is of Rama basil, purchased from an herb vendor at a 
farmer's market in Los Angeles. This variety is used mainly as a tea for 
therapeutic purposes. I see no reason it couldn't be used in cooking and 
have done so, but it isn't the kind found in Southeast Asia, and they 
don't use this sacred herb for for culinary purposes in India.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Holy Basil, sometimes called "Hot Basil" or 
"Humong Basil" can sometimes be found in markets serving an active 
Southeast Asian community. It is highly perishable, so it is often 
already wilted in the market. It is best if you can get it at a farmers 
market, from a grower who specializes in Asian herbs. Of course, you can 
grow it yourself.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If very fresh and loosely bagged in plastic, 
this basil will keep up to 2 days in the fridge. If you buy it at a market 
you'll be lucky if it lasts long enough to get it home. If the leaves are 
only a little wilted you can refresh it somewhat by cutting the stem ends 
off and immersing the whole bunch completely in cold water for an hour, 
then dry in your salad spinner.<p></p>

<h3>Substitutes:</h3> &nbsp; A number of substitutes have been proposed, 
including a mix of Thai Purple Basil and Mint or Perilla.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Unlike other basils which are used mostly raw 
or just warmed as a garnish, Holy Basil is always used cooked, generally 
added early in the cooking process. In Thailand it is often an ingredient 
in stir fries, and also used in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.<p></p>
