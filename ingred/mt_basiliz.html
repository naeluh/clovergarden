This Basil is universally called for in European and American recipes. 
Formerly it was very easy to grow in season, but for awhile it often 
fell victim to fusarium wilt, caused by a soilborne fungus, 
<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>basilicum</i>. Fusarium resistant 
varieties have been developed</p>
<p>Sweet Basil has decent keeping properties (almost a week if treated 
well). It is more aromatic and less sharp than 
<a href="mt_basiltz.html">Thai Purple Basil</a> but the two can be 
used interchangeably in a pinch. I've even used Thai Purple Basil to 
make Italian Pesto because I can get piles of it cheap at ethnic 
markets while Italian Basil can cost several dollars an ounce in the 
supermarkets.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Italian Basil is carried in just about every 
supermarket these days, but often at absurd prices. You may be able to 
procure it at a better price from farmer's markets when in season (Spring 
and early Summer). You can try growing it yourself (but see next 
topic).
<p>If the basil you bought If it's a little wilted, it can be 
refreshed by cutting the stem ends off and immersing the entire bunch 
completely in cold water for about 1/2 hour. Then dry in your salad 
spinner and wrap loosely in plastic.</p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; Once highly reliable, growing recently became  
crap shoot. If the soil was infected with fusarium fungus they would grow 
to 8 to 12 inches high, then start dropping leaves and wilting. 
Fortunately Fusarium resistant varieties have been developed (Nufar 
Hybrids).
<p>Fusarium infected soil should be sent to a landfill or sterilized by 
baking in the oven at high heat or by steaming because the fungus can 
hang on for another 8 to 12 years. Growing from seed was no defense - 
the fungus was spread by infected seeds, and there is no sure-fire way 
to certify them fusarium free.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If fresh, Italian Basil can be kept loosely 
bagged in the refrigerator for almost a week. It can also be frozen for 
longer storage. Freeze in water to prevent drying out - basil is pretty 
much worthless dried, though preserving it in salt works a bit better.
