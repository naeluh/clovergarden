This is one of the basils that has become common in Southern California, 
often labeled "Thai Basil". It is characterized by a citrus fragrance, 
smaller light green pointed leaves and a relatively light flavor - 
and bad keeping properties (maybe 4 days if you take good care of it). 
It often alternates with <a href="mt_basiltz.html">Thai Purple Basil</a> 
in the markets. The stronger more aromatic flavor of the purple is better 
for most Thai cooking while the Lemon Basil is used mainly for salads and 
some soups.</p>
<p>In Nigeria there is great confusion, as this herb is called "Curry 
Leaf", and so is the real 
<a href="ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> 
(<i>Murraya koenigii</i>). They are cooked differently as 
<i>M. koenigii</i> does not cook tender enough to eat.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Thai Lemon Basil can be found in markets that 
cater to a Southeast Asian community. If a little wilted this basil can 
be refreshed by cutting the stem ends off and immersing completely in 
cold water for about an hour, then dry in your salad spinner.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If fresh, Thai Lemon Basil can be kept loosely 
bagged in plastic in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 days. Freezing is not 
a good option because recipes usually call for it as fresh whole leaves. 
Dried it's completely worthless.<p></p>
