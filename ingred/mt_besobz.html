[Beso Bela; Ethiopian Sacred Basil; <i>Ocimum sanctum?</i>]

<p>This plant is native to Ethiopia and has important uses in Ethiopian and 
Eritrean cuisines. It is said to be a variety of Tulsi (South and Southeast 
Asian "Sacred Basil"). It is usually used dried, in spice mixes, for making 
Niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter), Shiro (a thick stew based on chickpea 
or broad bean powder), in teas, and in other dishes. The photo specimen is 
dried flower heads (preferred), but some products include or are dried 
leaves.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen was purchased on-line for 2021 
US $11 / ounce.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; There is no exact substitute, but some recipes allow 
dried Thai Purple Basil as reasonably close.
