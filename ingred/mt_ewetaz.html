<br><img src="img/mt_eweta02g.jpg" alt="Dried Eweta Leaves Leaves" class=mrg>
[Eweta, Marugbo (Nigeria (Ikale, Ilaje, Apoi)); Dagba (Nigeria (Urhobo); 
(Obenetete (Nigeria (Itsekiri)); <i>Clerodendrum volubile</i> of family 
<i>Lamiaceae</i> - formerly family <i>Verbenaceae</i>]
<p>
Best known from southern Nigeria, this climbing plant is also reported 
from other West African countries and as far south as Angola. The highly 
medicinal leaf is used in Nigera as an ingredient in Marugbo (Eweta) soup 
and also Gbanunu soup which incorporates other medicinal herbs.	Using the 
dried leaves these soups have a very dark, almost black color.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  these leaves are only available dried in North 
America, but that's the way it is almost always used in Nigeria, so no 
problem. The batch from which the photo specimens were drawn was 2021 
US $5.99 for "One Wrap". This measure was about 0.7 ounce, and by volume 
(very lightly packed) 2-1/2 cups. This volume is about what is called 
for in most recipes for the Nigerian soups, so "wrap" may be a legitimate 
measure there.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; These leaves are relatively high in 
Protein and minerals: Manganese (4.45 mg/g), Magnesium, Zinc (1.56 mg/g), 
Selenium (0.21 mg/kg), also Calcium, Phosphorus, and include Vitamins C and 
E, Flavonoids (124 mg/g), and various micronutrients. In Nigeria these 
leaves are used to treat many diseases and disorders, including diabetes. 
Usefulness for treating neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) 
has been medically confirmed.<p></p>
