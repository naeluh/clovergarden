<h2>Marjoram</h2> 
<p>[Sweet Marjoram, Knotted Marjoram; <i>Origanum majorana</i>]
</p><p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region, marjoram was known to the ancient 
   Greeks and Romans. It remains one of the most important herbs used 
   in the cuisines of Mediterranean Europe and the Levant. Marjoram is 
   as often as not used dried as it holds flavors well while drying.  
   Flavor holds better if the leaves are removed from the stems for 
   drying. </p>

<h2>Oregano</h2>
<p>[Wild Marjoram; <i>Origanum vulgare</i>]
</p><p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region and farther inland, this herb is 
   much used in Italian-American cuisine (as distinct from Italian 
   cuisine, which is quite different). It is used in southern Italy, 
   but the more gentle Marjoram is preferred to the north. 
   Oregano also finds plenty of application in Portugal, Spain, Greece, 
   Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, as well as Latin America and the 
   Philippines. 
   Oregano is used more dried than fresh, as its flavors intensify when 
   dried. Flavor holds better if the leaves are removed from the stems 
   for drying.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Marjoram and/or Oregano can be found in 
  the herb section of most modern supermarkets, and at some farmer's 
  market where herbs are sold. If only one or the other is available, 
  they are reasonably interchangeable.<p></p>
<p><b>Dried</b> is available in the spice section of most supermarkets, 
  but is better purchased from ethnic markets which have a high turnover. 
  Buy only whole leaf, never powdered. To substitute dry for fresh, use 
  about 1/3 the measure.</p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp;  Marjoram  and Oregano can be grown in most 
regions of North America, but in the cooler climates it must be treated 
as an annual because they are rather cold sensitive.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped, fresh marjoram and oregano 
  will last about a week in the fridge, if they were in good shape to 
  start with.<p></p>
<p><b>Drying:</b> &nbsp; If you can buy large bundles cheaply at a 
  farmer's market, or grow your own, it is quite easy to dry. I prefer 
  to remove the leaves from the stems for air drying to prevent any of 
  the flavoring elements from retreating into the stems. If you have 
  a dehydrator, drying will be so fast that can't happen.</p>
