<h1>The Mint Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p class=bg>The Mint Family (<i>Lamiaceae</i> of order <i>Lamiales</i>) 
is a worldwide family, including a huge number of herbs, a lot of small 
shrubs, and a few medium to very large trees. They are particularly noted 
as aromatic flavoring ingredients in cuisines worldwide, accounting for 
many of our most important culinary herbs. Quite a number are used as easy 
to grow decoratives and a few find application for their psychoactive 
properties.

<h2 id=gen>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The Mint Family is of worldwide distribution, though only Sage has 
much penetrated Central and South America.  These powerful aromatic herbs 
have been in use for both culinary and medicinal purposes since long 
before the dawn of history.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This page is, roughly, in order of relevance to people 
living in North America, not alphabetical or otherwise.</p>

<h2>Mints</h2>
<br><a href="mt_mint.html">
<img src="img/mt_mint05c.jpg" alt="Growing Mint Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Genus <i>Mentha</i> - many species.]
<p>
Native to Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and North America, mints 
are a major genus of mint family, cultivated worldwide as an important 
culinary herb.</p>
<p>Classifying mints is difficult even for botanists because they 
are highly promiscuous and cross breed with abandon, even from one 
species to another, and many unique cultivars have been developed. 
Many species have a half dozen or more "scientific" names and 
cultivars of the same species may vary in shape and color.</p>
<p>See our <a href="mt_mint.html"><b>Mint</b></a> page For 
photos, descriptions and details of culinary usage for many varieties.  
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Basils</h2>
<br><a href="mt_basil.html">
<img src="img/mt_basilital08c.jpg" alt="Growing Basil Plant" class=mrg></a>
[Genus <i>Ocimum</i> - many species.]
<p>
Basils are a nearly worldwide family consisting almost entirely of 
small herbs. Even the one exception only reaches 10 feet on slender 
stems. Many of these herbs have important culinary uses. Most are 
annuals, but African basils are perennials.</p>

Sages are the largest genus in the mint family, but fortunately we 
need deal only with a few of them for culinary and medicinal purposes.

<h2>Rosemary</h2>
<br><a href="mt_rosemz.html">
<img src="img/mt_rosem11h.jpg" alt="Rosemary Stems with Leaves" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>]
<p>
Rosemary is native to the Mediterranean region. From it's needle like 
leaves and strong resinous aroma you'd almost think this was some sort of 
conifer, but no, it's yet another mint. This is a very powerful herb to 
be used with discretion, fresh or dried. Fresh is considered superior for 
all uses, and it's the easiest herb there is to have fresh - it grows 
eagerly under poor conditions and can even get out of control. Various 
rosemary cultivars are used as durable, almost indestructible hedges, 
ground covers and decoratives here in Southern California - and it even 
grows well in England!</p>
<p>Rosemary has 
an affinity for meats, poultry and some vegetables when fried in olive oil, 
particularly potatoes but also eggplant, zucchini and tomatoes. It also has 
medicinal properties and is thought to help protect the brain from free 
radicals and possibly improve memory. It is very safe in culinary and 
therapeutic doses but is toxic in very large amounts (how you could eat that 
much of it I haven't a clue) and rosemary oil or extract must be used 
carefully. &nbsp; <a href="mt_rosemz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Thyme</h2>

<img src="img/mt_thyme02e.jpg" alt="Leafy Thyme Stems" class=mrg></a>
[Zatar (Farsi &amp; other), <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> (Mint family)]
<p>
While there are over 300 species of thyme, nearly all those of culinary 
use are varieties of <i>T. vulgaris</i>, a native of southern Europe and 
the Near East. Thyme is used especially for flavoring meat 
dishes and soup stocks. It is a very important herb throughout southern 
Europe, North Africa, Anatolia and the Near and Middle East 
as far as Persia, then tapering off into India. It is also important in the 
Caribbean and is well known as a powerful medicinal throughout its range. 
Thyme dries relatively well so it is often used as a dried herb.
 &nbsp; <a href="mt_thymz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>
<p><b>Other Thymes:</b> &nbsp; While <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> is by for the most 
important culinary thyme, others are also used. Details will be found on 
the <a href="mt_thymz.html#thymo"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a> page.

   [Sweet Marjoram, Knotted Marjoram; <i>Origanum majorana</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region, marjoram was known to the ancient 
   Greeks and Romans. It remains one of the most important herbs used 
   in the cuisines of Mediterranean Europe and the Levant. Marjoram is 
   as often as not used dried as it holds flavors well while drying.  
   Flavor holds better if the leaves are removed from the stems for 
   drying.

   [Wild Marjoram; <i>Origanum vulgare</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region and farther inland, this herb is 
   much used in Italian-American cuisine (as distinct from Italian 
   cuisine, which is quite different). It is used in southern Italy, 
   but the more gentle Marjoram is preferred to the north. 
   Oregano also finds plenty of application in Portugal, Spain, Greece, 
   Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, as well as Latin America and the 
   Philippines. 
   Oregano is used more dried than fresh, as its flavors intensify when 
   dried. Flavor holds better if the leaves are removed from the stems 
   for drying.

   [Hop Marjoram; <i>Origanum dictamnus</i>]
   <p>
   This herb grows only on rocky crags of the Greek island of Crete. It 
   is easily recognized by the light gray fuzz that covers its stems 
   and leaves. It has been held since ancient times to have both 
   medicinal and magical properties. It is also highly aromatic and 
   used to flavor vermouth, absinthe and herbal teas. It is now farmed 
   on Crete because men no longer wish to risk life and limb to pluck 
   it from the high rocks - and because of government protection of 
   wild plants.

   <h3>Za'atar</h3>

   [Lebanese oregano, Syrian oregano; Ezov (Hebrew); Bible hussop 
   (mistranslation); <i>Origanum syriacum</i>]
   <p>
   This herb is extremely important in the Levant and Middle East, where 
   it is native. A spice mix based on it is also called Za'atar. It is 
   a small shrub, up to about 3 feet high with small white or pale pink 
   flowers. Both the spice mix and the dried herb are used in the Levant 
   and Middle East, and the herb, often fresh, is used in Morocco. 
   The fresh herb is not much available in North America, but can be 
   faked up with a mix of Thyme and Oregano. Traditionally, za'atar has 
   been gathered wild, but the demand is now so high it has entered 
   cultivation.

   [Marzeh (Farsi); <i>Satureja hortensis</i>]
   <p>
   This annual herb is the savory available in markets in North 
   America, where Winter savory is rarely seen (if ever). 
   While savory resembles thyme, it is used more with vegetables, 
   eggs and fish rather than meats, particularly with beans and lentils 
   where it is said to significantly improve digestion. It is, however, 
   also used with meats and is often an herb included in sausages.</p>
   <p>While a minor herb in most of North America, summer savory is 
   popular in the Maritime Provinces of Canada where it is used instead 
   of Sage. Savory is particularly important to the cuisines of Bulgaria 
   and Romania.

   [<i>Satureja montana</i>]
   <p>
   Winter savory, a perennial shrub, is pretty much interchangeable with 
   Summer Savory but is considered more bitter - this difference fades 
   somewhat with cooking. It is, of course, not marketed here in 
   Southern California, because we don't have winter.

This fleshy leaved plant is native to South and East Africa, but has been 
planted in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. As some of the names imply, 
it's popular in the Caribbean region. With a scent and flavor similar to 
oregano and thyme, it is used in similar ways for seasoning meat and poultry. 
It is also a traditional medicinal, particularly for cough, sore throat and 
nasal congestion.

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<br><img src="img/lm_lavend01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Lavender Plants" class=mrg>
[English Lavender; <i>Lavandula angustifolia</i>]
<p>
<p>Lavender is native to the Western Mediterranean region, particularly 
the mountains of northern Spain. While not traditionally used in the 
cuisines of southern France, a commercial concoction called 
<i>Herbs de Provence</i> was invented which usually includes lavender 
flowers. Nonetheless, lavender buds, the only part containing the aromatic 
oils, are increasingly used as a flavoring and are often paired with 
sheep and goat cheese.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean region bees gather nectar from fields of lavender, 
producing a monofloral honey that is sold for a premium price.
Lavender flowers are sometimes candied and used as cake decorations, and 
dried lavender buds are sometimes blended with black, green or herbal teas 
to add a fresh fragrance.</p>
<p>Lavender oil has medicinal properties and is used to induce relaxation, 
but needs to be used cautiously because it does have some toxic effects, 
including stimulating boob growth in young boys, who would rather the 
growth be elsewhere.

Native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, this herb and is 
a favorite in North American herb gardens - but it has escaped and now 
grows wild in warmer regions.  The leaves have a light lemony flavor 
and are used in teas, fruit salads, iced teas, and in cooking as a 
substitute for lemon peel.

   These large leaves are widely used, particularly in Japan and 
   Korea, whole or shredded, as a garnish. Young flower spikes are used 
   as a garnish and to flavor pickles in Japan and Taiwan.
   <p>the photo specimens are clearly Korean. The Japanese Shiso leaves 
   are much more deeply serrated, they lack the purple color on the 
   underside common with the Korean variety, and the flavor is slightly 
   different. The Korean variety is much more available here in Los 
   Angeles as Japanese markets are now few and far between while Korean 
   markets proliferate like rabbits.</p>
   <p>For unknown reasons, the Korean name translates to "Wild Sesame" 
   or "Sesame Leaf", despite perilla being related to sesame only at the 
   very distant order level. Actual sesame leaves are rarely eaten, 
   though edible. The Chinese use perilla mostly as a medicinal to 
   stimulate the immune system rather than in their cuisine.

   stews, and particularly with rice vermicelli dishes called 
   <i>b&uacute;n</i>. In Laos they are used in a similar dish called

   Perilla seeds are less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) in diameter. In 
   Korea, they may be added to a recipe, or toasted, crushed and mixed 
   with sesame and salt for use as a condiment. They are similarly used 
   mixed with salt in Japan. In Nepal, and nearby parts of India, they 
   are toasted, ground and mixed with salt, chili and tomato to make a 
   condiment or dip. Powdered seeds are used as a flavoring and 
   thickener.</p>
   <p>Perilla seeds yield an oil high in ALA Omega-3 fatty acids. It 
   can stand cooking temperatures up to 350&deg;F/177&deg;C. Seeds,

[Blue Licorice, Purple Giant Hyssop, Indian Mint; Huo xlang (China); 
Bangannip (Korea); <i>Agastache rugosa</i>]
<p>
In Korea this herb is used to flavor some forms of <i>Jeon</i> pancakes. 
More famously it is used in stew, particularly <i>Bosintang</i>, a 
stew of dog meat, to remove objectional odors.  While this stew has 
been banned by the government of South Korea, it is still popular and 
easy to find in restaurants if you ask around. In North Korea all the 
dogs were probably eaten long ago. 
This plant is one of the 50 fundamental herbs of Chinese medicine.

[<i>Hyssopus officinalis</i>]
<p>
Native to southern Europe, east to the Middle East and around the 
Caspian Sea, this herb has been known for its medicinal properties 
since ancient times. Beekeepers favor hyssop for a rich and aromatic 
honey. It is used in cooking, but judiciously due to the intensity 
if it's minty aroma. It is also used to flavor Chartreuse liqueur.

[<i>Callicarpa americana</i>]
<p>
Native to North America, this shrub ranges from  Maryland to Florida 
and west to Texas and Arkansas. It can also be found in the Caribbean 
and parts of Mexico. While the berries of other species of 
<i>Callicarpa</i> are too bitter to eat, <i>americana</i> berries are 
fairly sweet, but are quite astringent. The berries are made into jams 
and are used to make beautyberry wine. The roots are used to make an 
herbal tea. Crushed leaves are a powerful insect repellant, effective 
against mosquitos and flies.

[<i>Tectona grandis</i>]
<p>
Teak is the largest of the mints, growing to over 130 feet tall. 
While it is best know for decay resistant lumber used for fine furniture and 
yacht decking, it does have culinary uses. The use best known 
in North America is salad bowls and salad serving utensils, but in the 
regions where teak grows (the tropics of India and Southeast Asia) the 
leaves are used for wrappers when making jackfruit dumplings.
