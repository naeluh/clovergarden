<p>[<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>]</p>
<p>
From it's needle like leaves and strong resinous aroma you'd almost think 
this was some sort of conifer, but no, it's yet another mint. This is a 
very powerful herb to be used with discretion, fresh or dried. Fresh is 
considered superior for all uses, and it's the easiest herb there is to 
have fresh - it grows eagerly under poor conditions and can even get out 
of control. Various rosemary cultivars are used as durable, 
almost indestructable hedges, groundcovers and decoratives here in 
Southern California - and it even grows well in England!</p>
<p>Rosemary has 
an affinity for meats, poultry and some vegetables when fried in olive oil, 
particularly potatoes but also eggplant, zucchini and tomatoes. It also has 
medicinal properties and is thought to help protect the brain from free 
radicals and possibly improve memory. It is very safe in culinary and 
theraputic doses but is toxic in very large amounts (how you could eat that 
much of it I haven't a clue) and rosemary oil or extract must be used 
carefully.

<h3>Buying</h3>: &nbsp; Well, if you really must buy it, you'll find 
  fresh rosemary in the the herb section of just about any modern 
  supermarket, and at just about any farmer's market where any herbs 
  are sold. I humbly suggest growing you own, or snatching a frond from 
  somebody's landscaping (you don't need much - its strong).<p></p>
<p><b>Dried</b> is available in the spice section of most supermarkets. 
  Buy only whole leaf, never powdered. To substitute dry for fresh, or 
  vice versa, the quantity should be roughly the same.<p></p>
<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped, it should survive a couple of 
  weeks in the fridge. I'm not really sure because I just go outside and 
  cut some when I need it.<p></p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Use descretion, generally don't use more than 
  the recipe calls for. Rosemary can withstand rather long cooking without 
  fading so it usually goes in early.<p></p>
