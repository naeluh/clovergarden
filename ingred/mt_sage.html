<h1>Sage - Genus <i>Salvia</i></h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Sages (genus <i>Salvia</i>) are the largest genus in the Mint 
Family (<i>Lamiaceae</i>) with nearly 700 species growing worldwide. 
Quite a number are garden decoratives, but mercifully, only a few are 
of wide culinary or medicinal interest. Some have been found to have 
a salutary effect on memory and may be of some use in treatment of 
Alzheimers.

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Sage is a worldwide herb (except Antarctica). Unlike other 
<i>Lamiaceae</i>, its center of diversity is in Central and South 
America. Sages are highly aromatic and of great culinary and medicinal 
interest. Note that "sagebrush" is not sage, it's in the daisy family.

   <p>
   [Common Sage; <i>Salvia officinalis</i>]
   </p><p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region, this sage is now planted in gardens 
   and by herb growers worldwide, and it is now naturalized in a number of 
   regions. throughout the world. This is the culinary sage sold fresh in 
   North America, while the dried is Greek sage. In cooking it is 
   particularly used with fatty meats and in poultry stuffings. It is one 
   of several sages from which an essential oil is distilled, but not the 
   most important, and it has a medicinal reputation from ancient times. 
   There are also many decorative cultivars that may have leaves colored 
   purple, white and yellow, as well as white, yellow and green variegated 
   varieties, but these generally have less flavor than the plain green.

   [<i>Salvia fruticosa</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the eastern Mediterranean, southern Italy, the Canary Islands 
   and North Africa, this sage has been in cultivation since prehistoric 
   times. This species accounts for probably over 90% of the dried sage sold 
   in North America. It is also used for extraction of an essential oil, as 
   well as being burned as incense.  Wasp galls an inch in diameter are often 
   found growing on this sage. They are called "sage apples" and are peeled 
   and eaten. The wasp causing the galls was not discovered until 2001. The 
   photo specimen was from Egypt and was quite strong despite its desiccated 
   appearance.

   <h2 id="sagec">Cleveland  Sage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mt_sgcleve08e.jpg" alt="Living Cleveland Sage Plant" class=mrg>
   [Blue Sage, Musk Sage, Maiden Sage (archaic); <i>Salvia clevenandii</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the coastal scrub of San Diego County, California and northern 
   Baja California, this is a highly aromatic sage that flowers profusely. 
   It will grow as far north as Los Angeles County in well drained sandy 
   soil, but above LA it is replaced by White Sage. It is much used for 
   sachets and similar aromatic applications but can also be used in place 
   of Garden Sage for culinary purposes <u>except</u> it is so strong the 
   amount used should be cut significantly.</p>
   <p>This sage is also a powerful medicinal. I have found a strong tea 
   of Cleveland Sage almost as effective as the Giant White Sage for 
   drying up a runny nose - blessed relief when I have a cold. Since it 
   grows well here in Los Angeles I keep a plant on hand.

   <h2 id="sagep">Pineapple Sage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mt_sgpinap04h.jpg" alt="Growing Pinapple Sage Plant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Salvia elegans</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala, this sage is often used 
   to make an herbal tea, and the leaves can also be used fresh as an herb. 
   It has also been extensively used in Mexican traditional medicine as a 
   treatment for anxiety.   
   <br class=cll></p>

  <h2 id="sagew">Giant White Sage</h2>
   <br><a href="mt_sagewz.html">
   <img src="img/mt_sagew02h.jpg" alt="Live Giant White Sage Plants" class=mrg></a>
   [Sacred Sage, Coastal Giant Sage; <i>Salvia apiana</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the coastal scrub of Southern California and Mexico, this tall 
   (to 5 feet) sage is used as a cleansing incense by American Indians, 
   some Neopagan groups and other spiritual seekers. The leaves look 
   much like those of Garden Sage, just a lot bigger, and can be used in 
   cooking.  It is also used medicinally, especially to suppress mucous 
   secretions from the sinuses, throat and lungs. I have used this sage 
   gathered in Ojai California and found a strong tea made from it quite 
   effective. It is not recommended for nursing mothers as it suppresses 
   lactation. Coastal Indian tribes have used the seeds to make porridge.

   <h2 id="chia">Chia</h2>
   <br><a href="mt_chiaz.html">
   <img src="img/mt_chia01h.jpg" alt="Chia Seeds" class=mrg></a>
   [Tokhm-e Sharbati (Persia - lit Sharbati Seed); 
   <i>Salvia hispanica</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Mexico and Guatemala, chia seed was the third most important 
   crop of the Aztecs, after corn and beans and ahead of amaranth. 
   It is highly nutritious and gluten free, with a high protein content, 
   and is very rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and dietary 
   fiber. Today the leading producer is Australia, followed by Mexico, 
   Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala.</p>
   <p>North of the Mexican border the main use of chia seed has been for 
   the green fur on Chia Pets, but it has started to penetrate the Health 
   Food and Ethnic Foods markets. In Persia (Iran) it is now used in 
   Sharbati (cooling soft drinks), alone or in combination with the 
   traditional <a href="cb_londrktz.html"><b>London Rocket</b></a> 
   seeds. Chia sprouts are edible and used similarly to alfalfa sprouts. 
   Food manufacturers are now experimenting with replacement of as much 
   as 25% of the egg and oil in cakes with a gel made from chia.

   <br><img src="img/mt_chiasg01h.jpg" alt="Desert Chia Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
   [Chia Sage, Desert Chia; <i>Salvia columbariae</i>]
   <p>
   Native to California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and Baja 
   California, this plant prefers undisturbed dry coastal sage scrub 
   and chaparral. It grows to a little over 18 inches tall, but is 
   usually shorter. This sage was very important to American Indians in 
   the growing region as a highly nutritious food and for medicinal 
   purposes. While less important today, it is still often used as it 
   was in the past. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2 id="saget">Tobacco Sage</h2>
   <br><img src="img/mt_saget01h.jpg" alt="Living Tobacco Sage Plants" class=mrg>
   [<i>Salvia dorrii</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the southwest of the United States, this sage has long been used 
   by American Indian tribes in the region as a sweat lodge incense and smoked 
   for a mild hallucinogenic effect. It is also used medicinally, especially 
   to suppress mucous secretions from the sinuses, throat and lungs. I 
   haven't tested this so I don't know if it's as effective as the 
   Giant White Sage or Cleveland Sage. It is not recommended for nursing 
   mothers as it suppresses lactation.

   <br><img src="img/mt_saged01h.jpg" alt="Living Diviner's Sage Plants" class=mrg>
   [Herba de Maria; <i>Salvia divinorum</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the cloud forests of Oaxaca, Mexico, this sage is used for it's 
   dissociative psychoactive properties. It has long been used by Mazatec 
   shamans to facilitate visionary states. It is fairly mild and is not 
   particularly toxic.</p>
   <p>In California and Canada sales to minors are illegal, but a few Red 
   States have banned it entirely. It is also banned in Australia and some 
   European countries. Import and sales are banned in Russia and Spain, but 
   I guess you can grow your own there.
