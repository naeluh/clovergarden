<p>[Sacred Sage, Coastal Giant Sage; <i>Salvia apiana</i>]</p>
<p>
Native to the coastal scrub of Southern California and Mexico, this 
tall (to 5 feet) sage is used as a cleansing incense by American 
Indians, some Neopagan groups and other spiritual seekers. The leaves 
look much like those of Garden Sage, just a lot bigger, and can be 
used in cooking.  It is also used medicinally, especially to suppress 
mucous secretions from the sinuses, throat and lungs. I have used this 
sage gathered in Ojai California and found a strong tea made from it 
quite effective. It is not recommended for nursing mothers as it 
suppresses lactation. Coastal Indian tribes have used the seeds to 
make porridge.</p>

The photo to the left shows a typical White Sage Smudge Stick for use as 
a cleansing incense in American Indian / Pagan ceremonies. It is 8 
inches long and 1-3/4 inches diameter. I got it as a door prize at a 
Christmas party, and, very unexpectedly, one I actually wanted and could 
use. Though it is intended to be burned as is, I will probably 
disassemble it and use part as ceremonial incense, and part as a 
medicinal.<p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This sage can be used similarly to Garden Sage, 
but keep in mind it is very much stronger, so cut down the recipe 
amount at least to half.<p></p>

<h3>Ceremonial:</h3> &nbsp; The smoke of this sage, set smoldering, is 
the preferred incense for cleansing the premise for mystical rituals  
or ceremonies held in North America. While originally much used by 
American Indians, it has been adopted by many other practices, 
including some Yoga disciplines. To my knowledge the mainstream 
Christian Churches are not currently using this incense.<p></p>

<h3>Medicinal</h3>: &nbsp; I have found that a strong tea of Giant 
White Sage, taken when I have a cold, dries me up for hours, without 
the side effects of pharmaceutical potions. The downside is that the 
tea is a bit strong and bitter. Cleveland Sage also works, but Garden 
Sage is useless for this purpose. This is, of course, strictly hearsay 
and can not in any way be construed as medical advice for treatment 
of any disease or condition.<p><p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't know of a Pagan dispensary in 
your area, various size and shape bundles of this sage are widely 
available on the Internet.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In an airtight container, kept away from heat 
and sunlight, it should maintain potency for at least 6 months.<p></p>
