<h1>Garden / Greek Sage</h1>

<p>[<i>Salvia Officianalis</i>]</p>
<p>
   Native to the Mediterranean region, this sage is now planted in gardens 
   and by herb growers worldwide, and it is now naturalized in a number of 
   regions throughout the world. This is the culinary sage sold fresh in 
   North America, while the dried is Greek sage. In cooking it is 
   particularly used with fatty meats and in poultry stuffings. It is one 
   of several sages from which an essential oil is distilled, but not the 
   most important. There are also many decorative cultivars that may have 
   leaves colored purple, white and yellow, as well as white, yellow and 
   green variegated varieties, but they generally don't have as good a flavor 
   profile as the plain green.</p>

  [<i>Salvia fruticosa</i>]
<p>
   Native to the eastern Mediterranean, southern Italy, the Canary Islands 
   and North Africa, this sage has been in cultivation since prehistoric 
   times. This species accounts for probably over 90% of the dried sage sold 
   in North America. It is also used for extraction of an essential oil, as 
   well as being burned as incense.  Wasp galls an inch in diameter are often 
   found growing on this sage. They are called "sage apples" and are peeled and 
   eaten. The wasp causing the galls was not discovered until 2001. The 
   photo specimen was from Egypt and was quite strong despite its desicated 
   appearance.</p>

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Garden Sage can be found in the herb section 
  of most modern supermarkets, and at some farmer's market where herbs 
  are sold.<p></p>

<h3>Dried Sage</h3> &nbsp; This form is available in the spice section 
  of most supermarkets. Buy only whole leaf, never powdered. The best 
  place to buy dried sage is at markets serving a Near Eastern community 
  as turnover will be high there. To substitute dry for fresh, use about 
  1/3 the measure.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; Garden Sage is fairly easy to grow, but needs 
to be replaced every two years as it is short lived. For best leaf 
growth, cut off flower heads when they appear.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped, fresh sage can survive at least 
  a week in the fridge.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Sage is most often associated with meat roasting, 
meat sauces and stuffings for turkey.<p></p>

<h3>Medicinal:</h3> &nbsp; Garden Sage and Greek Sage are not medicinally 
effective. If you need to dry up a runny nose or some similar problem use 
either Giant White Sage or Cleveland Sage.<p></p>
