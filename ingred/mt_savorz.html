   Summer Savory, an annual herb, is the savory available in markets in 
   North America year round, while Winter savory is rarely seen (if 
   ever). While savory resembles thyme, it has a lighter flavor and is 
   used more with vegetables, eggs and fish rather than meats. It is 
   particularly used with beans and lentils, where it is said to 
   significantly improve digestion. It is, however, sometimes used with 
   meats and is often an herb included in sausages.</p>
<p>Winter savory, a perennial shrub, is pretty much interchangeable with 
   Summer Savory but is a little more bitter - this difference fades 
   somewhat with cooking.</p>
<p>While a minor herb in most of North America, summer savory is 
   popular in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, where it is used instead 
   of Sage. Savory is particularly important to the cuisines of Bulgaria 
   and Romania.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Savory can be found in well stocked 
  herb section of some supermarkets, at some ethnic markets 
  and at some farmer's market where herbs are sold - but it's not 
  as common as many other herbs.<p></p>
<p><b>Dried</b> is available in the spice section of some supermarkets, 
  but is better purchased from ethnic markets which have a high turnover. 
  Buy only whole leaf, never powdered. To substitute dry for fresh, use 
  about 1/3 the measure.</p>
<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp;  Summer savory can be grown in most regions 
  of North America, planted after the last frost.<p></p>
<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped, fresh Summer Savory will last 
  about a week in the fridge, if it was in good shape to start with.
  <p></p>
<h3>Drying:</h3> &nbsp; Summer savory is generally cut near the ground 
  when in flower, and hanged to dry for winter use. I prefer using a 
  dehydrator so it dries fast and no flavor can withdraw into the 
  stems.<p></p>
