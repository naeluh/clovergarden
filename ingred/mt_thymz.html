<p>[Zatar (Farsi &amp; other), <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> (Mint family)]</p>
<p>
While there are over 300 species of thyme, nearly all those of culinary 
use are varieties of <i>T. vulgaris</i>, a native of southern Europe and 
the Near East. Thyme is used especially for flavoring meat dishes and 
soup stocks. It is a very important herb throughout southern Europe, 
North Africa, Anatolia, and the Near and Middle East as far as Persia, 
then tapering off into India. It is also important in the Caribbean and 
is well known as a powerful medicinal throughout its range. Thyme dries 
relatively well so it is often used as a dried herb.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh, this herb can be found even in the herb 
section of most North American supermarkets. Dried it can be found in 
every spice section. Note that, though the Near and Middle Eastern name 
for Thyme is "Zatar", in the markets this word generally describes a 
spice mix containing thyme and/or its near relatives along with other 
herbs and spices.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Leafy stems, if fresh and in good condition, 
will keep about a week loosely wrapped and refrigerated. Dried thyme 
should be kept in a tightly sealed container away from heat and light. 
It is fairly durable and can be used used for at least 6 months, maybe 
up to a year.<p></p>

<h3>Measures:</h3> &nbsp; "A sprig of thyme" is how thousands of 
recipes call for fresh thyme, a measure which they conveniently fail to 
define. I'm going to define it here as what has worked well for me - a 
single main stem about 5 inches long including its minor side branches. 
The photo at the top of this page includes three "sprigs", and I'm 
calling the middle one the "standard" sprig, and the lower one a 
"large sprig".<p></p>

<p>Recipes calling for fresh thyme in teaspoon measure mean for it to 
be leaves stripped from the stems. This is not always easy, as the stems 
often break up when you try to strip the leaves, or the leaves simply 
don't want to come off. A sprig, as defined above, will yield about 1/3 
teaspoon of fresh leaves (loosely packed).</p>

<p>Dried thyme and fresh thyme are interchangeable with some difference 
in flavor. The standard ratio is 3 t fresh = 1 t dry, but this is often 
hard to measure. Figure 1/4 teaspoon of dried thyme leaf is equivalent to 
a fairly large sprig, such as the lower one in the photo above. If you 
use powdered thyme, use 3/4 as much as you would dried leaf.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that cookbook writers are often sloppy and often presume 
their methods and sizes mean the same thing the world around. English 
cookbooks are among the worst offenders. The situation on the Internet 
is even worse than that - so always use your own best judgement.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In general, the word "thyme" alone in a recipe 
means fresh thyme. If dried thyme is meant it should be specified as such. 
Thyme takes time to release its flavors so it's usually added to the 
recipe in the early stages. The easiest way to use fresh thyme is just 
toss in a sprig (or more if called for) and fish the stems out later in 
the cooking. The leaves will all have fallen off by then.<p></p>

<h3 id="thymo">Thyme - Other</h3>
<br>While <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> is by far the most important culinary 
thyme, other species are also used to a lesser extent.<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Caraway Thyme</b> - [<i>Thymus herba-barona</i>]
  <br>This thyme gets its name from use to season "Barons of Beef" in 
  England, though it is native to Corsica, Sardinia and Majorca in the 
  Mediterranean. It has a strong caraway scent and can be used as a 
  substitute (or vice versa).</li>
<li><b>Hungarian Thyme, Eurasian Thyme</b> - [<i>Thymus pannonicus</i>]
  <br>Used for its lemon-like scent in herbal teas, and also to flavor 
  jams and candies. It is found mainly in Russia and eastern Europe.</li>
<li><b>Creeping Thyme, Wild Thyme</b> - [<i>Thymus serpyllum</i>]
  <br>Used to season meat dishes, particularly stews, cabbage and 
  vegetable  dishes containing zucchini and eggplant. The dried leaves 
  are used in herbal teas. This thyme is native to most of Europe and 
  North Africa and is widely distributed in North America, particularly 
  as a ground cover.</li>
<li><b>Spanish Thyme</b> - [<i>Plectranthus amboinicus</i>]
  <br>This is not actually thyme, but a completely different mint.
