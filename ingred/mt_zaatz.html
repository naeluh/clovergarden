This herb is extremely important in the Levant and Middle East, where 
it is native. A spice mix based on it is also called Za'atar. It is 
a small shrub, up to about 3 feet high with small white or pale pink 
flowers. The herb is usually used dried, but may also be used fresh 
in the Middle East, Levant and Morocco.  Traditionally, Za'atar 
has been gathered wild, but the demand is now so high it has been 
declared endangered in Israel, and some is now being cultivated.

<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; Neither the fresh herb nor the dried is much 
available in North America, so we have to fake it up (imperfectly) with 
a mix of Thyme, Oregano and Marjoram. For either fresh or dried, about 
4 Tablespoons Thyme, 1 Tablespoon Oregano, 1 Tablespoon Marjoram.</p>

<p>
This is a very important herb mix in the Levant and Middle East. 
Supposedly, it is based on the herb Za'atar, but most today is made 
from Thyme, Oregano and Marjoram, because the supply of Za'atar is 
no longer sufficient. Other ingredients are:  toasted Sesame Seeds, 
Sumac for sourness, and usually Salt. Some commercial versions may 
included toasted wheat flour - not good for Celiacs. Some versions 
also include savory, cumin, coriander or fennel, and one distinctly 
Palestinian version includes Caraway seeds. In the region, this mix 
may be also made with fresh herbs. The photo specimen is from our 
Lebanese style <a href="../recipes/myv_zaata1.html"><b>Za'atar 
- Herb Mix</b></a> recipe.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh, or even dried Za'atar herb is very 
difficult to find in North America, but various "Za'atar" spice 
mixes will be found in just about any market serving a Levantine, 
Near Eastern or Armenian community. Most of them are not very good, 
and they are faked up due to the shortage of the Za'atar herb. so why 
buy them when you can so easily make a better one using our 
<a href="../recipes/myv_zaata1.html"><b>Za'atar - Herb Mix</b></a> 
recipe?<p></p>

<h3>Uses:</h3> &nbsp; The spice mix is often presented as a table 
condiment. Various regional breads may be dipped in Olive Oil, and then 
into a Za'atar mix. The mixes are also used as seasoning and rubs for 
many dishes.<p></p>
