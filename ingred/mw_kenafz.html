<h1>Roselle / Hibiscus / Gongura <small>&amp;</small> Kenaf</h1>

<p>These plants in the order <i>Malvales</i> (Mallows) have always been 
important fiber crops and that remains their most important use to this 
day, but the sour leaves are also used in many recipes from the regions 
where they are grown. Both Roselle and Kenaf can go by the name 
"Gongura" in India.</p>

  <i>Hibiscus sabdariffa</i>]
<p>
This plant is closely related to the taller, green stemmed Gongura / 
Kenaf (<i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i>) but Kenaf fruit pods are very 
different in structure. Like Kenaf, Roselle is primarily a fiber crop, 
growing to 8 feet tall, but also has a wide variety of culinary and 
medicinal uses.</p>
<p>The leaves are a very important herb or vegetable in a good part of 
India (Andhra, Karala, Karnataka, Assam and others), and valued for their 
iron content. They are used in a wide variety of pickles, dals and curries, 
particularly goat and mutton curries, but also with chicken and pork. 
They are also much used in Burma, especially with fish and shellfish, and 
in Africa, particularly Senegal, where they flavor a recipe for 
fish and rice.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California, red stemmed 
Roselle now appears in our Indian markets and some farmer's markets 
that have a good Asian grower.  It is very seasonal - I have bought 
fresh leafy stems, as in the photo above, in early July, and long 
stems with lots of fruit but relatively few leaves in early November.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; If in good condition, a bunch of gongura will 
last a week loosely wrapped in plastic and refrigerated. Should yours be 
a bit wilted, trim the stem ends and completely submerge the bunch in 
cold water for about 1/2 hour. Dry sufficiently that there is no free 
water (I use a salad spinner) and pack loosely in plastic.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; For cooking, only the leaves are used, even the 
leaf stems are too fibrous for culinary usage. Leaf yield is about 40%, 
so you need about a 10 ounce bunch to yield 4 ounces of leaf. For some 
recipes, whole or coarsely chopped leaves are used, as in Indian goat 
or mutton curry, but others, like dal, want it chopped fine.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Unlike other sour leaves such as spinach and 
sorrel, gongura is sturdy and needs at least 20 minutes simmering. It 
will hold up to quite a bit more.<p></p>


<h2>Roselle Fruit</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_kenaf04f.jpg" alt="Fruit with Leaves" class=mrg>
This plant fruits prolifically. The fruit pod, similar to a short 
stubby okra pod, is surrounded by a calyx of dark red petal like 
sepals. There are two styles, the short one (photo) and the long 
one where the points around the base are also long. The photo specimens 
were purchased from an Asian vegetable grower at a farmer's market in 
Los Angeles (Montrose).
<p>The sepals could be used in salads as a color accent, but the pod is 
not particularly edible due to the many stiff fibers it contains. It is 
almost edible raw, but cooking hardens the sharp fibers while softening 
the pod, and the seeds remain quite stiff, quite unpleasant. They are, 
however, used by the Shan people in Burma as a souring agent in 
stews.</p>
<p>Simmering the whole calyces in water produces a brilliant crimson 
broth that is just a little sour and quite pleasant enough to serve as 
the basis for herb teas. It is best to remove the pod, which can make 
the broth a bit mucilaginous - it's related to okra, after all.</p>
<p>The calyces contains enough pectin that jam can be made from them 
using only sugar and calyces. I haven't been tempted to try this because 
jams require more sugar than I'm comfortable with in anything.</p>
<p>These fruits, have significant medicinal properties, particularly 
for lowering blood pressure by helping increase nitric oxide and reducing 
oxidized lipids in the blood. They are very high in vitamin C, 
antioxidants and phytochemicals, and have been found useful in treating 
metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis, liver disease, cancer and 
diabetes, The seeds are a good source of fat slouble antioxidants.

<h2>Jamaica / Hibiscus "Flowers"</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_jamaica08f.jpg" alt="Dried Jamaica Calyx" class=mrg>
This is the form most people are familiar with, the dried calyx. 
Bins and bags will be found in markets serving a wide variety of 
ethnicities. A metal tube with sharp teeth on the business end is 
slipped over the stem and used to core out the pod before drying.
<p>These are used for making tea, usually called "hibiscus tea in North 
America. This tea is used both for pleasure and for medicinal purposes. 
In industry they are used as a food coloring, particularly in 
Europe and the United States. They are also used to make economical 
cold drinks throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, as well as 
southern Europe, parts of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
Called "Sorrel" in the Caribbean, it is mixed with sugar and various 
herbs and spices. In Jamaica it is brewed with fresh ginger, then 
chilled and strengthened with rum.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Candied Jamaica / Hibiscus "Flowers</h2>
<br><img src="img/mw_jamaica11f.jpg" alt="Candied Jamaica Calyx" class=mrg>
<p>For this form, the fruits are cored as for drying, but instead of 
drying they are candied with a mixture of starch and finely powdered 
sugar. They are quite pleasant, moderately sweet/sour with a lightly 
chewy texture, more delicate than other candied fruits. They make a 
very nice small desert that most guests will find quite surprising. I 
buy these from a big multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena).

Yute de Siam de gambo, (Spanish); and many, many more; 
 <i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i>]
<p>
This plant, probably originating in South Asia, is cultivated worldwide 
for many uses: rope fiber, paper, edible leaves, oil, animal feed and 
bedding, fiberboard, engineered wood and thread for fabrics. The 
ancient Egyptians used it to make the ropes and sails for their ships. 
It can grow to about 11 feet tall with stems up to 1 inch diameter. 
Currently small crops are grown in California, Texas and Louisiana, mostly 
for animal feed and bedding, but you can expect it to expand as more of 
its uses are exploited, particularly if hemp remains illegal in the US 
(hemp has similar fibrous properties but is not related).</p>
<p>The leaves are widely eaten in India, and preferred to the leaves of 
Roselle, but I haven't seen this plant here in Southern California. The 
seeds are pressed for cooking oil, which has a very similar fatty acid 
profile to Cottonseed Oil, but with more Omega 3. It is commonly called 
Gongura for culinary uses and Kenaf for industrial and fiber uses. This 
plant is closely related to the smaller, red stemmed Roselle / Gongura 
(Hibiscus sabdariffa), but has green stems and much different fruit pods. 
Roselle has wider culinary and medicinal useage.
