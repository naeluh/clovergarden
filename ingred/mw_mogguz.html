<p>[Indian Capers (incorrect); Marathi Moggu (Kannada, Marathi); Shalmali, 
Semul (Hindi); Appakuttaka, Parappoola, Parapanni (Malayalam); Ilavu, Puulaa, 
Mullilavu, Badi Laung (Tamil); Andhra Moggu, Andhra Mogga; 
<i>Ceiba pentandra</i> of family <i>Malvaceae</i> (Mallow family)]</p>
<p>
This tree is native to southern Mexico, the Caribbean, and northern South 
America, and  variety <i>guineensis</i> is found in West Africa. It has been 
widely introduced into cultivation in South and Southeast Asia, mainly 
used for fiber from the mature pods, but also as a spice.</p>

<p>The flower buds of this tree are described as a "kind of caper" in many 
listings, but they obviously are nothing of the kind, they are flower buds 
of the Kapok Tree, a Mallow, not a Mustard. They are used to some extent in 
Maharashtra, but much more in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh farther to the 
south. This spice is important in many rice dishes in those states. They 
are also an ingredient in masala powders in Chettinad, Tamil Nadu.  Oil 
from the seeds can be used for cooking, but becomes rancid very quickly.
</p>

<h3>Small Buds</h3> are very hard and difficult to grind. They are 
usually dry pan roasted before grinding. The photo specimens, about 1 inch 
long counting the stem (which is used with the tip) were picked very young. 
These were purchased from an exporter in India for 2014 US $11.99 per 100 
grams (3-1/2 ounces).<p></p>

<h3>Large Buds</h3>, picked just before opening, are usually fried in 
a little oil before grinding. They were of random size, from 1.00 inch long 
by 0.22 inch diameter to 3.20 inches long by 0.51 inch diameter and weighed 
20 to the ounce average. These were purchased on-line for 2021 US $21.95 for 
400 grams (14 ounces).<p></p>

<p>This tree is native to India, Southeast Asia and southern China. The 
dried flowers of this tree are used in Burma (Myanmar) in soups. They are 
also gathered in Guangdong Province, China, dried, and used in soups and 
teas. In the Shan State of eastern Burma, and in adjacent northern 
Thailand, the dried cores of flower buds are used in soups and curries.
It has been reported that the calyx (cup that surrounds the petals) of 
fresh flower buds is used as a vegetable in India.</p>
<p>In India, the dried buds are used as Marathi Moggu, just as from it's 
relative <i>Ceiba pentandra</i> (see above).
