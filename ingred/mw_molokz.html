Fiber of mature molokhiya plants is known as Jute, but for use as food the 
plant is picked young and cooked as greens. While thought native to India, 
it has been the most important green in Egyptian cooking since ancient times. 
Consequently, it's available frozen in stores serving Near Eastern 
communities In season (Summer months), it's available fresh in Southern 
California, sold as "Okra Leaf". In Egypt leaves are also dried (they are 
thin and dry quickly) and are crumbled into a powder for use in teas and 
soups.</p>
<p>The leaves are quite mucilaginous when cooked. Most Americans would 
consider them "slimy", but in North Africa and the Levant the effect is 
much liked.  In these regions the most common use is in Chicken stews, 
particularly with rice.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh molokhia is usually sold in Southern 
California as "Okra Leaf", which it is not. Okra leaves are broad with 
a fingered shape. It is now quite common here in Southern California in 
markets that serve a Near Eastern, Indian or Philippine community (we 
have a lot of all of those). The leaves are thin and wilt very quickly 
so buy them last and get them home and into the fridge immediately to 
keep them from getting dried edges.

<p>If they have become wilted you can refresh them by cutting the stem 
ends as for cut flowers, then float the entire fronds in cold water for 
an hour or so. Just sticking the cut ends in water does no good at all.
</p>
<p>Frozen Malokhia can also be found in Philippine markets and markets 
serving a Levantine or North African community.</p>

<h2>Prep:</h2> &nbsp; To use, pick off the leaves and wash them. If you 
will be storing them for a while give them a good spin in your salad 
spinner, then wrap loosely and refrigerate. You can also use the tender 
tips of thick stalks (even thin ones are fibrous). Bite into the 
left-over end and if it's fibrous you cut too far down.<p></p>

<h3>Freezing:</h3> &nbsp; Prep leaves as above. Bring plenty of water to 
a full boil in a fairly large pot over highest heat. Pour in the leaves 
and keep them submerged by poking down with a wooden spoon. As soon as 
the water is back to a boil, measure 1-1/2 minutes. Drain. Bag with water 
to prevent freezer burn.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Molokhia is most often chopped small or rolled 
and shaved into threads to bring out its mucilaginous qualities, which 
are much desired in Levantine and Egyptian cooking. It is then added to 
soups a few minutes before serving. Whole leaves are used in Borani 
recipes.

<p>Frozen molokhia is almost always already chopped fine. It is generally 
added to soup while still frozen and stirred a little until completely 
thawed and the soup is back to a simmer.</p>
