[Daun Salam (Indonesian), Salam Leaf, Indian Bay Leaf (obsolete), 
<i>Eugenia polyantha</i>]
<p>
Native to Borneo through Indonesia, this leaf is used in cooking only in 
that region - but in Indonesia in particular it is used a lot. Fresh leaves 
are used in curries and with meat, and dried leaves when fresh are not 
available. Packages of dried leaves are often labeled "Indian Bay Leaf", 
an obsolete usage from when Indonesia was called East India.</p> 

<p>Many cookbooks, presuming you can't get Daun Salam, suggest using European 
bay leaves. This is bad advice - Salam is not at all related to either 
European or Indian bay leaves, both of which are highly aromatic Laurels with 
an entirely different and more powerful flavor. Daun Salam is a myrtle. The 
leaves are thinner and less aromatic, more earthy, and with a definite hint 
of citrus. A much better substitute is Curry Leaf (which is a citrus). 
Certainly not exact, but at least in the ballpark.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh leaves are not yet available in Los Angeles, 
and if not here, good luck finding them anywhere. Dried leaves are, however, 
available in Asian markets that have a significant Malay or Indonesian 
clientele, and they work decently.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Some in Indonesia say the subtle flavor of 
Salam leaf is enhanced by frying a moment before mixing with other ingredients 
(as is often done in India with curry leaf), but Gernot Katzer found no 
significant flavor enhancement from this procedure. He did find that letting 
fresh leaves wither and dry for a few days did increase yield of essential 
oil. <p></p>
