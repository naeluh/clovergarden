<h1>Pomegranates</h1>
<br><img src="img/my_pomeg04g.jpg" alt="Whole and Broken Pomegranate Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Punica granatum</i> of family <i>Lythraceae</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Socotraan Pomegranate (Yemen); <i>Punica protopunica</i>]
<p>
The fruit of this shrub, native to Iran and eastern Turkey, has been in  
use since prehistoric times. In the Ancient World it had already spread 
throughout the Mediterranean region, North Africa, the Caucasus, and 
India. Around 700 CE it reached southern China and drier parts of 
Southeast Asia, with Spanish settlers bringing it to California and Latin 
America in 1769. It is now also cultivated in Arizona. Pomegranates 
failed to fruit in England, but were planted in the English colonies 
that are now the southeastern states of the United States.
The smaller, less sweet <i>P. protopunica</i> grows only on the island of 
Socotra, Yemen, and is thought to be a remanent population of the 
precursor of <i>P. granatum</i>.</p>

<p>The spherical red fruits can range between 2 and 4-3/4 inches diameter 
and contain between 200 and 1400 seeds. The seeds are soft and can be 
chewed up while enjoying the sweet juice laden <i>sarcotesta</i> (swolen 
seed coat) that surrounds each seed. In Victorian England pomegranates 
were considered inedible except by children, because it was too much 
trouble to remove the seeds. No properly cultured Victorian would eat 
<i>seeds</i>! You couldn't just spit them out either, because nothing 
that went into the mouth could come out except fish bones.</p>

<p>Pomegranates are very widely used through the Mediterranean region, 
including Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, and on through the Middle East 
into India. They are used to make the products listed below, and the 
juicy seeds are used whole as an ingredient in many dishes, and as a 
garnish. They are considered the national fruit of Armenia.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The fruit we get in Southern California is 
dark red when ripe, but different shades may be common in other 
countries. The best way to tell that a pomegranate is fully ripe on the 
tree is that it has started to split open. This is more risky for 
commercial pomegranates, as soundness depends on storage and shipment 
conditions - there should be no decay associated with the splitting, 
and if it has opened you should see unblemished red seeds inside.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The main problem is getting all those seeds out 
of the shell - the pulp and membranes are bitter. The general method is 
to cut off the flower end, being careful not to cut into the seed 
chambers, and scoring the rind from stem end to flower end into quarters. 
At this point some people put the pomegranate into a bowl of cold water 
for 15 minutes or so, then break it up and seed it under water, because 
the seeds sink and the pulp and membranes float. I don't bother with 
the water and have little trouble breaking them up and seeding them dry. 
Another way is to slice the pomegranate crosswise in the middle, then 
holding it cut side down over a bowl, whack the rind with a heavy spoon 
until most of the seeds have fallen out, then pull out any shards of 
membrane. I haven't tried this method.<p></p>

<h2>Anardana</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomanr05h.jpg" alt="Dried Pomegranate Seeds" class=mrg>
Dried pomegranate seeds are a common seasoning in Iran and the northern 
reaches of India. In the Caucasus and the Levant they are used less, but 
are used where liquid Pomegranate Molasses would not work, or a crunchy 
texture is desired. The best are from wild pomegranate shrubs that 
produce small, sour fruit. The photo shows dried seeds from my 
pomegranate shrub, which produces small sour fruit. Anardana includes 
the formerly juicy sarcotesta, so it should be soft, a bit sticky, and 
distinctly reddish. Much sold in North America is badly overdried, hard 
and inferior - better to use lemon juice.
<p>This seasoning is used sparingly. In India, the seeds are usually 
roasted until crisp and aromatic, and then ground to various textures. 
In India, this seasoning is used mainly to liven up vegetable and dal 
dishes, and in chutneys.  In the Levant, ground seeds are often 
sprinkled over humus and salads. In a tightly sealed container stored 
away from light and heat, this condiment lasts about a year. It is also 
sold ground, but is much more perishable that way.

<h2>Pomegranate Wine</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomw02c.jpg" alt="Glass of Pomegranate Wine" class=mrg>
<p>
This wine is popular in Armenia, and that I've found in Southern 
California is mostly from Armenia, but what would you expect when 
Glendale is the "Western Capital of Armenia"? It is usually a semi-sweet 
wine bottled at about 12% alcohol. The wine is both fascinating and 
delicious. I recommend these as dessert wines for folks who,  
like myself, don't like overly sweet wines. Pomegranate wine 
is also made in California, of course - we grow tons of pomegranates 
(mostly variety <i>Wonderful</i>), have lots of highly experienced 
wineries, and a plentiful supply of Armenians as well. Examples I have 
encountered were about 13% alcohol, with varieties both drier and 
sweeter than the typical Armenian wines - and sparkling wines too.

<h2>Pomegranate Vinegar</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomv02c.jpg" alt="Glass of Pomegranate Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
Anything that can be yeast fermented into wine or beer can be further 
fermented by bacteria into vinegar, with residual flavor of the wine or 
beer it is made from. This holds also for pomegranate wine, but you will 
be hard pressed to find a real pomegranate vinegar. They are pretty much 
all grape wine vinegars flavored with pomegranate. Trader Joe's (photo) 
is typical, starting with white wine vinegar at 10% acidity and adding 
water and pomegranate juice concentrate to bring it down around 4%.
The result is a somewhat sweet vinegar with definite pomegranate flavor.
It could be a good vinegar for salads, particularly salads with fruit.

<h2>Pomegranate Molasses</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomm02c.jpg" alt="Glass of Pomegranate Syrup" class=mrg>
<p>[Pomegranate Syrup]
</p><p>This is an essential ingredient from Greece 
through the Middle East, the Caucasus, Turkey and Iran, as well as parts 
of North Africa. There are a number of brands sold here in Southern 
California, but most have sugar or corn syrup as the main ingredient. 
The photo specimen is from Lebanon, with ingredients: Pomegranate 
Molasses, Sugar Syrup. Yes, there is sugar, but at least pomegranate is 
the primary ingredient. This syrup is made from relatively sour varieties 
of pomegranate, so it is fairly tart, even with the sugar.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pomegranate Juice</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomj02c.jpg" alt="Glass of Pomegranate Juice" class=mrg>
<p>This juice has been very much in the health news for its very high and 
unique antioxidant content. Preliminary results show it may have 
significant health benefits, particularly for heart health, but more 
extensive studies are needed. The major downside is the amount of sugars, 
which can be as much as 1 teaspoon sugar per ounce of juice. Pomegranates 
are roughly 6.5% fructose, 6.1% dextrose, 0.4% sucrose and a trace of 
maltose (studies vary in exact percentages). Unfortunately, I don't know 
if these percentages are calculated with or without the brown seeds. 
Counter to food industry claims that "all sugars are the same", current 
research finds fructose is metabolized differently, and is more dangerous 
than other sugars.</p>
<p>Pomegranate juice lacks any fiber and, while pomegranates are high in 
vitamin C, there is none in bottled pomegranate juice, as it is 
destroyed by pasteurization. Also destroyed are some of the polyphenol 
antioxidants present in raw pomegranates. &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; 
many beverages featuring "pomegranate" on the label are blends, with 
cheaper juices outweighing pomegranate. Citric or malic acid and even 
sugar are commonly added to cover up a weak flavor. Select only brands 
that list "100% Pomegranate Juice". 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pomegranate Peels</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_pomp02h.jpg" alt="Pomegranate Peels" class=mrg>
The peels are hard, bitter and inedible, but they contain as much as 
three times the antioxidants and other desirable substances as the 
seed pulp. These substances are extracted for use in dietary supplements 
and natural food preservatives.
