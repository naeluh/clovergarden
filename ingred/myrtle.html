<h1>Myrtles &nbsp; - &nbsp; Order Myrtales</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<i>Myrtales</i> are a mid size order of often aromatic tropical and 
subtropical shrubs and trees. The Myrtle family (<i>Myrtaceae</i>) is the 
most important, and particularly important in the flora of Australia.  
Some, such as Eucalyptus, prefer temperate climates rather than tropical. 
A number of tropical and sub-tropical species bear edible fruit. 
We've put all the <i>Myrtales</i> families on one page so we don't end 
up with a bunch of orphans.

<h2>Myrtle</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_myrtle01k.jpg" alt="Myrtle Leaves, Blue Berries" class=mrg>
[Common Myrtle; <i>Myrtus communis</i>]
<p>
This is the Mediterranean myrtle of myth and legend. Myrtle oils have 
been used medicinally since ancient times, and still are today, 
particularly for sinus infections. It's only culinary usage is as a 
flavoring for an alcoholic beverage called Mirto, made in Sardinia and 
Corsica. It is made in two colors, red and white, depending on the color 
of the berries used. Red is most common.

<h2>Allspice</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_allsp02h.jpg" alt="Allspice Fruits containing seeds" class=mrg>
[Jamaica pepper, Myrtle pepper; Pimenta, Pimento (Spanish); English pepper 
(Hebrew); <i>Pimenta dioica</i> of family <i>Myrtaceae</i>]
<p>
Native to the Caribbean, southern Mexico and Central America, this spice 
is produced by a tree that can grow to 60 feet tall. The name comes from 
the English, who thought the dreied fruits tasted like a combination of 
cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. The tree has now been planted in tropical 
climates around the world. Allspice is very important in Caribbean 
cuisine, and has been enthusiasticall adopted in the Levent. In Germany 
it is used in sausages.</p>
<p> This spice should always be bought as whole dried fruits, as it 
declines rapidly if ground. It is soft and easily ground. In the growing 
region the leaves are also used as a flavoring, but they become worthless 
when dreied, so are not a commercial item. The photo specimens vary 
considerably in size, with the largest 0.330 inch diameter and the 
smallest 0.227 inch diameter (8.4 to 5.8 mm).

[<i>Punica granatum</i> of family <i>Lythraceae</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Socotraan Pomegranate (Yemen); <i>Punica protopunica</i>
<p>
The fruit of this shrub, native to Iran and eastern Turkey, has been in  
use since prehistoric times. In the Ancient World it had already spread 
throughout the Mediterranean region, North Africa, the Caucasus, and 
India. Around 700 CE it reached southern China and drier parts of 
Southeast Asia, with Spanish settlers bringing it to California and Latin 
America in 1769. It is now also cultivated in Arizona. Pomegranates 
failed to fruit in England, but were planted in the English colonies 
that are now the southeastern states of the United States.</p>
<p>The smaller, less sweet <i>P. protopunica</i> grows only on the island 
of Socotra, Yemen, and is thought to be a remanent population of the 
precursor of <i>P. granatum</i>. Pomegranates have many culinary 
applications throughout their range, and there are many products made 
from them.

<h2>Water Caltrop</h2>
<br><a href="my_wcaltz.html">

[Water Chestnut, Buffalo Nut, Bat Nut, Devil Pod; Singhara; Pani-fol 
(India); Hishi (Japan); Lingjiao (China); Family <i>Lythraceae</i>, 
<i>Trapa bicornis</i> and <i>Trapa natans</i>]
<p>
These strange looking hooked pods are the seeds of floating water plants. 
They have been cultivated in India and China for more than 3000 years, and 
were much eaten in Europe from prehistoric times until near the end of the 
19th century. They are now nearly extinct in Europe due to climate change 
and draining of swamps and wetlands, but <i>Trapa natans</i> has become 
a pest in North America, from Vermont to North Carolina and in Washington 
State.</p>

<p>The photo is of <i>T. bicornis</i> from East Asia, three in the shell, 
(3 inches point to point), and four shelled ones in the middle. 
<i>T. natans</i> is more triangular, with much shorter but sharper horns. 
It is the species listed as a "noxious weed" in much of the United 
States. Seeds do not float, and can remain viable for up to 12 years, 
which makes it difficult to eradicate. It's pretty hilarious that 
these are in the same plant family as the pomegranate.

<h2>Guava</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_guava06h.jpg" alt="Guava Fruit, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[Guava, Apple Guava; <i>Psidium guajava</i> | Strawberry Guava (red), 
Lemon Guava (yellow); <i>Psidium cattleianum</i> |  (and about 100 
more species]
<p>
Guavas are native to Mexico, Central America and northern South America, 
but are now cultivated in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, Australia 
and North America. Here in Los Angeles two varieties are commonly sold, a 
green Apple Guava, and a smaller yellow variety. This genus does not 
include the pineapple guava, a popular back yard fruit shrub.</p>
<p>Because Guavas have tough outer skins and the sweet/tart flesh is 
filled with very hard seeds, they are difficult to eat out of hand. They 
are usually processed into beverages, blocks of guava paste, or jellies. 
They are very high in antioxidants and vitamin C, (about 4 times as much 
as in an orange).
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Giant Guava</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_guavg02e.jpg" alt="Large Guava Fruit, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[Probably Apple Guava; <i>Psidium guajava</i> ]
<p>
This appears to be a variety of the regular green Apple Guava, or a 
very closely related species - it did have a somewhat apple like flavor. 
At their state of ripeness when the photo was taken, the flesh was still 
a bit crisp, lightly sweet, just slightly sour, and the seeds were hard. 
The skin was thin and delicate. The uncut specimen in the photo was 4 
inches diameter, 3.4 inches long and weighed 15-1/4 ounces. It was 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2018 US $3.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Arrayan</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_array02h.jpg" alt="Arrayan, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[Sartre Guava; <i>Psidium sartorianum</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; and many 
other Myrtles]
<p>
This is very confusing, because there are many Myrtles (and some non 
Myrtles) that are called "Arrayan" in Spanish. Most have very small 
fruit, 0.4 to 0.6 inches diameter. The ones in the photo were from 
Guatemala, shipped frozen. I'm calling them <i>P. sarorianum</i> 
because it fits the photos and descriptions I've found, and it's the 
only one reported to produce fruit as large as 1-1/2 inches, though 
most trees produce fruit about 0.6 inches in the wild.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were up to 1.65 inches diameter, quite tart but 
with excellent flavor, and skin so thin it can be eaten. Like all 
guavas, they were full of seeds, but that doesn't bother me, I just 
swallow the seeds. Most were not as ripe as the cut specimen, so the 
seeds were much less obvious and more tender. These were purchased 
frozen from a large Hispanic market in Los Angeles (Burbank) for 2016 
US $4.56 per pound.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Pineapple Guava</h2>
<br>
<img src="img/my_feijoa02h.jpg" alt="Pineapple Guava Fruit, whole, cut" class=mrg>
[Feijoa, Pineapple Guava, Guavasteen; <i>Acca sellowiana</i>]
<p>
Native to the highlands of southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, Uruguay, 
and northern Argentina, this shrub is now popular in Southern California 
back yards and grown in other parts of North America as well. It is also 
grown in (former Soviet) Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>The flavor is sweet and aromatic, and the flesh slightly granular. It 
can be eaten by cutting in half lengthwise and scooping the flesh out 
with a spoon. It is also used in fruit drinks and smoothies, and in New 
Zealand it is used in stewed fruit recipes.</p>
<p>Ripeness is not easy to determine. This is generally done with a gentle 
squeeze, it should yield but not be soft. Generally, when perfectly ripe 
they drop from the bush, but must be gathered daily because they decline 
rapidly, browning on the inside. The flower petals are also delightfully 
edible, fleshy, sweet and aromatic.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Camu Camu</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_camuc01h.jpg" alt="Camu Camu Fruit, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Myrciaria dubia</i>]
<p>
Native to riverbanks along the Amazon, this cherry size red fruit is now 
one of those "superfruits" sold in health food markets, generally in 
powdered or bottled form. It was never significant as a native food because 
it is much too acidic and needs to be mechanically blended into a smoothie 
to be appreciated. It is rich in vitamin C (which declines as the fruit 
matures, and doesn't survive processing well, and is rich in a number of 
flavonoids.</p>
<p>As with other exotic fruits that become health fads, it is over priced 
and being over harvested - heading for endangered status. The government 
of Brazil is trying to encourage farming it to save the wild shrubs.

<h2>Guavaberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_rumbery01h.jpg" alt="Ripe Guavaberries" class=mrg>
[Rumberry; <i>Myrciaria floribunda</i>]
<p>
Closely related to the Camu Camu, this shrub or tree (up to 60 feet high) 
bears orange to dark red, nearly black fruit about half the size of a 
cherry, The flesh, which has a tang similar to guava, is translucent 
and surrounds a single seed. The tree is found wild in Central America, 
South America, and many of the Caribbean islands. It has been introduced 
to Florida, Hawaii, Bermuda, and the Philippines. Its main use is to 
make guavaberry flavored rum, but it can also be made into jam.

[Brazilian Grape, Jabotica, Guaperu, Guapuru, Hivapuru, Sabar&aacute;, 
Ybapuru; <i>Myrciaria cauliflora</i>]
<p>
Native to Southeast Brazil, this tree bears dark purple fruits up to 1-5/8 
inches diameter directly on the trunk and major branches. The purple skin 
is thick and astringent, covering a sweet white gelatinous flesh and a 
single seed. Where they grow, they are popped as a snack as we do grapes 
in North America. They are also made into jams, wine, and liqueurs.</p>
<p>Because their shelf life is a mere 3 to 4 days, they are rarely seen 
outside the growing regions. The fruit contains antioxidants and 
compounds that may be useful against cancer and inflamation.

<h2>Cagaita</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_cagaita01k.jpg" alt="Cagaita Fruit, leaves" class=mrg>
[cagaiteira;  <i>Stenocalyx dysentericus</i>]
<p>
Native to Brazil, these trees can produce about 1500 fruits between the 
months of September and December. The fruits are yellow, a little over 
an inch in diameter with a single seed loose in the center. They have a 
sweet - sour, slightly astringent taste. The fruit can be kept for only 
about 3 days unrefrigerated, maybe 10 days in the fridge, so it isn't 
seen much outside the growing region. It can be eaten out of hand, but 
if you eat much of it that way it'll give you the runs. It is also used 
to make beverages, sweets, jams and sherbets.

[Uvalha do campo, Ubaid do campo, Uvalheira; <i>Eugenia luschnathiana</i>]
<p>
Native to Bahia Brazil, this tree, which grows to 30 feet high, is 
cultivated for it's fruit. It has been introduced to Florida but has not 
become popular there. The fruit is up to 2 inches diameter, containing 
one or two seeds. The bright orange/yellow fruits have a thin skin over 
a soft, juicy, aromatic, golden yellow flesh. The taste is somewhat tart 
and slightly resinous. These fruits are used to make jams, jellies and 
carbonated beverages.  This pitomba is often confused with a soapberry 
fruit also called <a href="sb_soapbry.html#pitom">Pitomba</a>. 
This one has prominent sepals (stiff petal-like features) projecting 
from where the flower was, while the soapberry fruit is browner and 
smooth at the flower end.  &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

<h2>Araza</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_araza01e.jpg" alt="Araza Fruit, whole, split" class=mrg>
[Araca-boi; <i>Eugenia stipitata</i>]
<p>
Native to the Amazon Rainforest of Brazil, this  small to medium size tree 
bears a fruit with distinctive flavor, and is about as sour as lemons. 
It is usually used to make juice or jam, or as a culinary souring agent. 
Fruits can be as large 3-1/2 inches diameter and as heavy as 1-1/2 pounds, 
the tree is drought tolerant, so there is interest in developing more 
commercially viable varieties (the current variety's fruit is difficult 
to ship). Some are planted in California, but not yet sold commercially.

<p>
Native to northeastern South America, this plant bears white flowers that 
mature into red fruit about 3/4 inch diameter. The fruit ranges 
from sour to sweet, the darker they are in color the sweeter. The primary 
use of the fruits is as a flavor base for jams and jellies. Surinam Cherry 
was introduced to Bermuda as an ornamental, but has gotten out of hand 
there.

This plant, native to Eastern and Central North America, has been widely 
planted in northeastern Europe where it quickly became a folk remedy. It 
is noted for its seeds containing a large amount of gamma-linolenic acid, 
which has unique properties. It is considered an anti-inflammatory, used 
to treat skin problems and may have potential as an anti-cancer agent. 
The leaves are edible and were traditionally used as a leaf vegetable.

<i>Epilobium angustifolium]</i>
<p>
Native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, this opportunistic herb 
quickly establishes itself in disturbed ground, whether from fire, railroad 
construction, bomb craters or whatever.</p>
<p>Young shoots are edible and were 
gathered by American Indians in combination with other greens. Stems of 
more mature plants can still be eaten if peeled. Roots are edible roasted 
if the outer skin is scraped off and the dark central thread is removed. 
They are best gathered before the start of flowering, when they will become 
bitter. Fireweed is high in vitamin C and pro-vitamin A.</p>
<p>In Alaska, fireweed is used to flavor confections, and in Russia 
leaves were used as a substitute for tea (Kapor tea). The leaves can be 
fermented as is done to make black tea.

Differing from most of the culinary <i>Syzygium</i> species, cloves are 
the dried unopened flower buds rather than the mature fruit. These highly 
aromatic flowers grow in big clusters on a tree native to Indonesia (the 
leading producer). They are now also grown in India, Madagascar, 
Zanzibar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The tree grows to about 35 feet. The 
flower buds are harvested when they turn red but have not yet started to 
open. They are dried, and then packaged for shipping.

[Daun Salam (Indonesia), Salam Leaf, Indian Bay Leaf (obsolete); 
<i>Eugenia Polyantha</i>]
<p>
Native to Borneo through Indonesia, this leaf is used in cooking only in 
that region - but in Indonesia in particular, it is used a lot. Fresh 
leaves are used in curries and with meat, and dried leaves when fresh are 
not available. Packages of dried leaves are often labeled "Indian Bay 
Leaf", an obsolete usage from when Indonesia was called East India.</p> 

<p>Many cookbooks, presuming you can't get Daun Salam, suggest using European 
bay leaves. This is bad advice - Salam is not at all related to either 
European or Indian bay leaves, both of which are highly aromatic Laurels with 
an entirely different and more powerful flavor. Daun Salam is a myrtle. The 
leaves are thinner and less aromatic, more earthy, and with a definite hint 
of citrus. A much better substitute is Curry Leaf (which is a citrus), but 
Salam is not as strong, so use a little less. &nbsp;

[Tea Tree Oil; <i>Melaleuca alternifolia</i> | Cajuput oil, Paperbark;

<p>
The only association these highly medicinal Australian trees have with 
the culinary arts is as an ingredient in burn ointment and topical 
disinfectants. Tea tree oil is made mainly from <i>Melaleuca</i> rather 
than the closely related Tea Tree proper (<i>Leptospermum</i>). I must 
say, though, that I very much like the tea tree oil soap I buy from 
Trader Joe's.</p> 
<p><i>Melaleuca quinquenervia</i> was planted in Florida to help drain 
swamps. Now they'd really rather have the swamps back. These trees spread 
quickly, and stands are so dense they are totally impenetrable. They are 
so flammable the former swamps are prone to firestorms. The photo 
specimen is a twig from my <i>Melaleuca leucadendra</i>.

Formerly a tea high in vitamin C was made from the leaves of this shrub 
or small tree to ward off scurvy. Native to Australia, the main culinary 
use of Tea Tree today is in the production of honey. Due to the nature 
of the plant and its nectar, Tea Tree honey is the most antiseptic honey 
known.

<h2>Eucalyptus</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_eucal02h.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus Leaves on Twig" class=mrg>
[<i>Eucalyptus</i> many species]
<p>
These highly medicinal trees, native to Australia, have many uses, but 
their only culinary use is as a flavoring - mainly for throat lozenges 
and the like. It is interesting as the tallest flowering plant, and the 
third tallest of all plants, after Coast Redwood and Douglas Fir (both 
conifers).</p>
<p>Eucalyptus was brought to California for lumber - a failed project 
because eucalyptus wood twists as at dries, destroying anything built 
with it. It did, however, serve exceedingly well as wind breaks. There 
is no wind that can knock over a blue gum - unless you bought it from 
a nursery, in which case a medium breeze will knock it over (root ball 
problem).</p>
<p>The photo specimen is from one of my Blue Gums. Note the bug bites. 
Back in the '80s you never saw such a thing, but now, just as in 
Australia, you rarely find an unchewed leaf. Some say the pests were 
brought deliberately by eucalyptus haters, but if so, their plan has 
failed - the trees are pretty much unfazed.

<h2>Malabar Plum</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_malplum01k.jpg" alt="Malibar Plum Fruit, whole, broken" class=mrg>
<p>
Native to Southeast Asia, this tree has been introduced worldwide, but 
especially in the Indian state of Karela. It is most often eaten raw, 
often with a sprinkle of spiced sugar to counter a slightly bitter 
aftertaste. In some regions this aftertaste does not appear. The flesh 
is crisp and watery and the fruit may range from light green through 
yellow to red when ripe depending on variety. It is usually between 1 
and 1-3/4 inches diameter. Ripeness can be judged by shaking the fruit 
to see if the seeds rattle around. The photo specimens were grown in 
South Africa.

[Black Myrobalan, Chebulic Myrobalan; <i>Terminalia chebula</i>]
<p>
Native from India and Nepal east to Yunan China and south to Sri Lanka 
and Southeast Asia, this tree grows to almost 100 feet tall. It's ripe 
fruit, 3/4 to 1-3/4 inches long, looks like a ridged and wrinkled nut, 
but it is usually picked unripe when it is smooth. The fruit is pickled, 
preserved in sugar or honey syrup, or made into preserves. While long 
used in Indian Aurvedic medecine, it has now come to the attention of 
Western researchers as an aid in joint comfort and mobility.

[Gubinge, Billygoat Plum, Murunga; <i>Terminalia ferdinandiana</i>]
<p>
This small to medium tree (to 46 feet) is native to northwestern 
tropical forests of Australia, and has been used by Aboriginal 
Australians for food. Usually it is eaten raw, but can be made into 
jam. It is most noted for having more vitamin C than any other known 
fruit, about 50 times as much as Oranges - however, cultivated fruit 
does not approach the concentration in fruit gathered from the harsh 
wilderness. The yellow-green fruit is about 0.79 inch long and 0.39 
inch diameter (2 x 1 cm). Due to safety concerns, the US FDA has 
rejected Kakadu Plum concentrate as a New Dietary Ingredient.

<p>
Native to Queensland and New South Wales in eastern Australia, this berry is 
a popular bush food for both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The 
berries are sweet and aromatic with good gingery flavor, but are next to 
impossible to exploit commercially due to their "melt in the mouth" 
tenderness. They pretty much have to be eaten right off the shrub.
