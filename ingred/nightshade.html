<h1>Nightshades</h1> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <span class=ts>Deadly &amp; 
Otherwise</span>
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg><b>The Nightshades</b> (family <i>Solanaceae</i>) first 
appeared more than 52 million years ago. Today they are worldwide, a vast 
and variable family that practically defies cataloging, because new 
varieties appear constantly (with or without human intervention).</span>  
Nightshades are toxic in whole or in part, but the nontoxic parts of 
many have become critical to world food supply and the cuisines of all 
nations.
<p>The <i>Brugmansia</i> flowers in the photo (angel trumpets) are 
typically nightshade - all have five points, though some may be cup shaped 
(deadly nightshade), trumpet shaped (datura) or nearly tubular (Peruvian 
tree tobacco). Yellows, whites and purples are the predominant colors.

<h2 id="hist">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Medieval and Renaissance Europe knew mainly the toxic Black Nightshade 
(<i>Atropis belladonna</i>) and it's near relatives, but later Eggplants 
were brought from the East. With the discovery of the New World came a flood 
of nightshade varieties, some edible, some toxic, some used for their berries 
(tomatoes, chilis), a few used for their roots (potatoes), and some used for 
their toxic leaves (tobacco).</p>

<p>Carried worldwide by European traders in the 1500s the three main New 
World food varieties, potatoes, tomatoes and chilis (including mild bell 
peppers) are so thoroughly incorporated into all the major cuisines it's 
difficult to imagine what they might have been like before 1500.</p>

<h2 id=var>Varieties</h2>

<p>Nightshades are now so important to all our cuisines (with the possible 
exception the Inuit and a few other isolated groups), each major group has 
its own sections, and a separate section for the minor ones as well.</p>

<a href="ns_tomato.html"><h3>Tomatoes</h3></a> &nbsp; - 
  &nbsp; [<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>]
<br><a href="ns_tomato.html">
<img src="img/to_mix01s.jpg" alt="Tomatoes" class=mrg></a>
<p>Native from Mexico to Peru, the versatile tomato has become one of the 
most important of fruits used as a vegetable. Used raw in salads, as the 
primary ingredient of many sauces and condiments, and as a major flavoring 
ingredient in soups and stews.
<br class=cll></p>

<a href="potato.html"><h3>Potatoes</h3></a> &nbsp; - 
  &nbsp; [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>]
<br><a href="potato.html">
<img src="img/ns_potmix06s.jpg" alt="Potato Mix" class=mrg></a>
<p>Native to Peru, the potato is well adapted to growing at high altitudes and 
in harsh environments. The versatile tubers of this plant have become a welcome 
source of nutrition worldwide, though dependence on single varieties has 
occasionally been disastrous, most notably in Ireland.
<br class=cll></p>
  
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><h3>Chilis</h3></a> and sweet peppers 
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Solanum capsicum</i>]
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
<img src="img/cp_mix06s.jpg" alt="Chilis" class=mrg></a>
<p>Native to Central and South America, chilis were quickly carried all over 
the world by Portuguese and Spanish merchants during the early 1500s. They 
have been enthusiastically adopted into the cuisines of nearly every tribe 
and country, particularly in the tropics. They provide both spicing and a 
degree of protection from spoiling. 
<br class=cll></p>

<a href="ns_eggplant.html"><h3>Eggplants</h3></a> &nbsp; - 
  &nbsp; [<i>Solanum melongena</i>]
<br><a href="ns_eggplant.html">
<img src="img/ns_eggmix08s.jpg" alt="Eggplants" class=mrg></a>
<p>Native to Asia, this vegetable entered European cuisines rather slowly due 
to its obvious resemblance to the deadly black nightshade and its berries. 
It is named for varieties that are white and about the size and shape of 
goose eggs. 
<br class=cll></p>


<a href="ns_physalis.html"><h3>Physalis</h3></a> &nbsp; - 
  &nbsp; Tomatillos and others &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [<i>Physalis</i>]
<br><a href="ns_physalis.html">
<img src="img/ns_tomatillo06s.jpg" alt="Tomatillos" class=mrg></a>
<p>A worldwide family sometimes called "husk tomatoes". The most used is the 
Tomatillo, essential to many Mexican green sauces. Others are eaten in their 
native regions.
<br class=cll></p>

<a href="ns_exotic.html"><h3>Other Nightshades</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Solanaceae</i>]
<br><a href="ns_exotic.html">
<img src="img/ns_petunia01s.jpg" alt="Petunia Flowers" class=mrg></a>
<p>Nightshades, some deadly, some addictive, some used as mind 
altering substances, some medicinal, and others that yield attractive 
and tasty fruit and/or nutritious leaves.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Followers of Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic movement condemn all 
nightshades out of hand as highly destructive to the human organism. 
Since I eat tomatoes by the flat (raw with salt), drink chili sauce out 
of the bottle, cook eggplants early and often, and consume potatoes in 
all forms from raw to deep fried to distilled in bottles with Russian 
labels, I probably died 30 years ago and just never noticed.</p>

<p>The true proof of damaging diets is demographics. No correlation 
has been found linking bad health to high consumption of nightshades nor 
any correlation with shortened lifespan in nightshade consuming 
populations. Ireland and Germany are still populated despite heavy 
consumption of potatoes, Italy has not suffered from tomatoes nor Asia 
from eggplants - and the whole world has survived chilis.</p>

<p>Most nightshade plants are mildly toxic and some are very toxic so you 
should eat only the parts commonly consumed and found safe. I remember 
some dingy '70s health food advocate writing, "We throw away what is 
probably the most nutritious part of the potato, the sprouts". I hope 
nobody followed her suggestion - it wouldn't kill you, but it might 
make you quite sick.</p>

<p>Nightshades contain more or less of the alkaloid nerve toxin 
<i>Solanine</i>, particularly in the green parts and sometimes in the berries, 
but the parts commonly eaten contain none or negligible amounts. Potatoes 
exposed to light have some in the skin to the extent it has turned green, 
and it is said some people are sensitive to this but I've never noticed a 
problem with greenish potatoes, even when only lightly cooked. Your mileage 
may vary.</p>

<p>Solanine toxins are destroyed by thorough cooking, so even the toxic 
Black Nightshade berries have been used safely in preserves and pies. This 
detox technique explains why some early Italian tomato sauces were long 
cooked, presuming all nightshade berries needed the detox treatment 
(there were also economic reasons). Today even raw tomato sauces are 
commonly used in Italy, and most sauces are cooked for a short time.</p>

<p><b>Nightshades and Arthritis:</b> &nbsp; The jury is definitely 
still out here. Some people report good results from eliminating 
nightshades. Some report no effect at all and others report the 
opposite. There is <u>no consensus</u> from properly conducted studies 
- and there is a lack of such studies in any case. There is no 
consensus from people who have tried eliminating nightshades either.
</p>
<p>This is all complicated by the very high variability in individual 
reactions to natural and unnatural chemical compounds. If you suffer 
from arthritis pain, some clinicians suggest cutting out nightshades 
entirely (some say for three weeks, some for 3 months) and see if your 
condition improves - but be realistic and watch out for the placebo 
effect. If this does help you, don't presume it will help all others - 
again, the high variability from one person to another, or one 
demographic to another.</p>
