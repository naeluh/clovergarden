[Jimson Weed, Devil's weed, Devil's cucumber, Thorn-apple, Pricklyburr, 
  Angel's trumpet and Devil's trumpet, <i>Datura stramonium</i>, also 
  similar <i>Datura wrightii</i>]
<p>
A common weed here in Southern California, this plant is far more deadly 
than the Deadly Nightshade. It's mind altering powers are so awesome 
even people heavily into "recreational substances" have generally shunned 
it. All parts of the plant are highly toxic.</p>

<p>Unlike psilocybin or LSD, which cause sensory distortion, datura is a 
true hallucinogen, transporting the user entirely into another reality 
with little or nothing of this reality to hang on to. An additional 
problem is that there is little margin between the effective dose and a 
fatal dose. Persons who have heard of this plant but not studied its use 
thoroughly often take a dose and find no effect - so they take a second 
dose of similar size and die.</p>

<p>The expert advice is "Don't", but if you do be very, very careful and 
have adequate and adequately briefed support staff on hand, strong 
enough to control you and with access to emergency care. Keep in mind 
that if the user's personality is not rock solid (does not describe most 
recreational substance users) it's likely to become completely unglued.

The photo to the left is of Datura Plants, one of which has a nearly 
mature seed pod.  These plants are pollinated by Sphinx Moths (Hawk 
Moths), so strong and fast they seem more like birds than insects. 
They can even hover like a humming bird. The moths are also toxic, 
because in their lava stage they fed on toxic leaves of the Datura 
plants.
