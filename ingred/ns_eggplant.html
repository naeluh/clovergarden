<p>These plants are members of the prolific Nightshade (<i>Solanaceae</i>) 
family. All are species <i>Solanum melongena</i> except as noted 
below. They got called "Eggplants" from white and yellow varieties about 
the size of hen, duck or goose eggs. These were common in times past and 
white ones are still seen in Southern California produce markets when 
they are in season.</p>

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Eggplants are thought native to Southern India and Sri Lanka and have 
been cultivated since prehistoric times. They were probably brought to 
Europe by Arabs around 1500 CE. Europeans at first thought them poisonous 
since all their native nightshades were, but they were soon adopted into the 
cuisines of the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>Eggplants are now grown worldwide and are available in many varieties 
and sizes (as all nightshades are). More varieties are grown in India than 
anywhere else, and while the common "Indian eggplant" well known in the 
U.S. weighs just a couple ounces, varieties as large as our globe 
eggplant are grown there.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="close">Varieties &nbsp; - &nbsp; Relatives Called "Eggplant"</h2>

<h2>African / Vietnamese Eggplants</h2> 

<br><a href="ns_epvietz.html">

<p>[Gboma (Africa); <i>Solanum macrocarpon</i> (cultivated), 
<i>Solanum dasyphyllum</i> (wild)]
</p><p>
Technically not an eggplant, but very closely related, this nightshade 
originated in West Africa. It has been introduced into Central and East 
Africa, the Caribbean, South America and parts of Southeast Asia.
There are many cultivars and land races of this species which vary 
considerably in fruit size. The photo specimen has very long calyx lobes 
but some have medium or short lobes. Unripe the fruit may be green, 
white, or purple, but generally ripens to yellow or yellow-brown.They 
are most commonly harvested unripe and eaten raw or cooked, though 
they are fairly bitter.

<h2>African / Ethiopian Eggplants</h2> 

<br><a href="ns_epethioz.html">

<p>[Bitter Tomato, Mock Tomato; Garden Eggs (Nigeria); Diakhato, Jaxatu 
(Wolof (pronounced the same)); Aubergine Africaine (French); Khamen Akhaba 
(Manipuri, India); Samtawk (Mizoram, India); <i>Solanum aethiopicum</i>]
</p><p>
Various cultivars of these plants are grown in Asia and tropical 
Africa. As with other nightshades, there are many varieties. The photo 
specimens are from northeastern India, but some varieties, particularly 
in Africa, look like tiny pumpkins with very deep sutures, and ripen to 
orange or red. The fruit is usually picked unripe before the skin 
thickens, and is eaten both raw and cooked. It can be sweet or bitter 
depending on cultivar. Young leaves are cooked as nutritous greens.</p>
<p>Fruits of these plants are particularly popular in Manipur and Mizoram 
in the extreme northeast of India. In Nigeria the fruits are used 
similarly to tomatoes to make a sauce. They are also used in curries in 
Thailand and Vietnam. A fair number are grown in Brazil for the African 
communities there, and a few are grown in Italy, probably brought back 
from Ethiopia by Italian soldiers.

<p>
This close relative of the eggplant, producing fruit about 0.4 inch 
diameter, is native to the Americas, from Florida through the Caribbean 
and from Mexico south into Brazil. It has been naturalized throughout 
the tropics and can be a serious pest in some environments (the plants 
grow large and have lots of thorns). The berries grow in clusters, and 
are usually picked green, but can ripen to yellow and bright red.

<h2>Thorn Apple</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epthorn01h.jpg" alt="Ripe Thorn Apple on Plant" class=mrg>
[Bitter Apple; <i>Solanum incanum</i>]
<p>
This shrub is the plant from which the domesticated Eggplant was 
developed. It is native to Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia from Arabia 
east to India. The fruit is 1 to 1.4 inches diameter and ripens to 
yellow or brown. All parts of the plant are toxic, but in West Africa 
cultivars have been developed that provide larger, edible fruit and 
edible leaves. Within its range this plant has a large number of 
medicinal uses, but it is also used as a vegetable rennet in making 
cheese. The photo specimen was photographed in the mountans of 
Oman, in the far southeast of the Arabian Peninsula.

<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties &nbsp; - &nbsp; True Eggplants</h2>
<p></p>
<h2 id="china">Chinese Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epchina04e.jpg" alt="Chinese Eggplants" class=mrg>
These elongated eggplants are easily recognizable by their light purple 
color. In Southern California they are available second only to the globe 
eggplant. They can be used interchangeably with Italian, Japanese and 
Philippine eggplants and are an imperfect but generally satisfactory 
substitute for Indian eggplants. The longest photo specimen was 15-1/2 
inches long, 2 inches diameter and weighed about 11 ounces. Most are 
less elongated, the front one being a more typical shape.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="skins">Eggplant Skins</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epskin01h.jpg" alt="Eggplant Skins" class=mrg>
These conical skins are used for stuffing in Turkey and Lebanon and are 
generally served as appetizers. Skins are usually sold strung on a piece 
of string in markets serving a Near Eastern community. Hard as old 
leather, they need to be soaked at least overnight before you can use 
them for anything.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="globe">Globe Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epglobe08h.jpg" alt="Globe Eggplants" class=mrg>
The standard supermarket eggplant, globes vary greatly in size and 
regularity of shape. They may be perfectly pear shaped or quite lopsided 
but are always a deep purple color. The photo specimen was 8 inches long, 
5-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 2-1/4 pounds, about an average size.
<p>Some writers say these come in Male and Female versions, a biological 
absurdity. For details see 
<a href="ns_eggplantw.html#male">"Male" &amp; "Female" Eggplants</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="india">Indian Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epindia11h.jpg" alt="Indian Eggplants" class=mrg>
These small egg shaped eggplants are now very common in California 
produce markets because of the significant Indian population here (and 
probably in other centers of technology). They come in two varieties, 
purple and variegated with the purple most common. They are almost never 
peeled.
<p>This is the eggplant to presume in Indian and Burmese recipes unless 
the instructions make it clear elongated or globe eggplants are intended. 
Indian eggplants vary somewhat in size. The largest photo specimen was 
3-3/4 inches long, 2-3/8 inches diameter and weighing 4-1/8 ounces, a bit 
above average. The smallest in the batch (not shown) was 1-7/8 inches 
diameter and weighed just 1-1/8 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="italy">Italian Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epital07h.jpg" alt="Italian Eggplants" class=mrg>
These dark purple eggplants appear very similar to Japanese eggplant but 
are invariably a lot shorter. They are the second most available eggplant 
nation-wide after the globe.  The center photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches 
long, 1-3/4 inches diameter and weighed just under 5 ounces.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="japan">Japanese Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epjap06h.jpg" alt="Japanese Eggplants" class=mrg>
These very elongated eggplants are smaller than the Chinese and are a very 
dark purple, sometimes almost black. You can tell them from the similar 
Italian eggplants because the stem end is purple, while on Italians it is 
green. These eggplants have a very thin skin which makes them desirable 
for stews, curries and the like.They vary greatly in size but are 
typically about 8 inches long, 1-1/2 inches diameter and weigh 5 ounces. 
These are widely available in Southern California produce markets but 
are somewhat seasonal.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="med">Mediterranean Sweet Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epmed01e.jpg" alt="Med. Eggplants" class=mrg>
<p>
I have no idea if they actually grow these in the Mediterranean region, 
but Med. Sweet is how they're marketed in California. They may actually 
be related to a sweet Italian eggplant which is of a variegated white 
and purple color and more blocky in shape. The degree of sweetness over 
regular eggplants is noticeable but not great. These were 4-1/4 inch 
diameter spheres weighing just about 1 pound each. They are not common 
and are available only seasonally.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="phili">Philippine Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epphil10h.jpg" alt="Eggplants" class=mrg>
These elongated eggplants are similar in shape to the Japanese and Chinese 
eggplants but distinguished from them by the mix of purple and green color. 
They vary quite a bit in size with the largest in the photo 9-1/2 inches 
long, 2-7/8 inches diameter and weighing 14 ounces. They are available in 
most markets that serve a Philippine community (generally near major 
hospital and health care centers).
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="thai">Thai Eggplant / Nandyala Eggplant</h2> 
<br><a href="ns_epthaiz.html">
<img src="img/ns_epthai13h.jpg" alt="Thai Eggplants" class=mrg></a>
<p>[Kermit Eggplant, Green Eggplant; Makua, Makhuea pro (Thai); Poluru 
Vankayalu (India - Telugu); <i>Solanum melongena</i>]
<p>
These unique, easy to identify eggplants are now widely available in 
California and the Southwest. They stay noticeably firmer than other 
eggplants when cooked so can take longer cooking and more abuse. They 
are never peeled. They are usually between 1-1/2 and 2-1/4 inches 
diameter and weigh up to 2-3/4 ounces. When cut, the seeds should be 
very light beige (the photo shows the darkest acceptable). If they 
are dark the eggplant is old and will be bitter.</p>
<p>This is also the predominant variety grown in Andhra Pradesh and 
Tamil Nadu in southeastern India, The Indian version tends to be a bit 
more elongated than the Thai, but the coloration and cooking properties 
are the same.

<h2 id="thaik">Vietnamese Pickled Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epthaik02e.jpg" alt="Vietnamese Pickled Eggplants" class=mrg>
<p>
[Ca Phao, Ca muoi (Viet)]
</p><p>
These are apparently ca trang (white eggplant) judging from the amount of 
seeds. Another, ca nghe (yellow eggplant is also used for pickles but has 
relatively fewer seeds. Very crunchy with a light eggplant flavor, they 
are about 1 inch in diameter. In Vietnam, pickled eggplants of this sort 
are considered an indispensable accompaniment for soups.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="white">White Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_epwhite02h.jpg" alt="White Eggplants" class=mrg>
These are likely where the name "eggplant" came from, as they are often 
egg shaped, varying from chicken egg size to duck egg size and on to 
goose egg size - but they also come in elongated shapes, like the photo 
specimens.
<p>White eggplants have tough skins which need to be peeled (unless 
you're stuffing them) but the flesh is a little more mild than purple 
eggplants. The photo specimen in the center was 7-1/4 inches long, 1-7/8 
inches diameter and weighed 5-3/4 ounces.  Availability is erratic, both 
for white eggplants at all and for particular shapes  - you just have to 
buy them when you can get them. Here in Los Angeles I saw these 
occasionally a few years ago, but not at all for a couple of years now 
(2013).
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p>Eggplants are a good source of dietary fiber and contain appreciable 
amounts of potassium, manganese, copper, vitamin B1, B6 and foliate.</p>

<p>Scientific studies have concentrated on the high content of important 
antioxidants and free radical scavengers. Eggplants are considered 
very good for both anti-cancer and anti-cholesterol considerations.</p>

<p>Eggplants contain more oxalate than other nightshades and most other 
vegetables. Oxalates can affect persons with pre-existing kidney and gall 
bladder problems. While oxalates are known to inhibit calcium absorption 
this effect is very small and foods containing oxalates generally provide 
more calcium to the diet than they inhibit.</p>

<p>Eggplants contain an unusually high amount of nicotine alkaloids, but 
you would have to eat at least 20 pounds of eggplant to achieve the amount 
from smoking one cigarette.</p>

<p>Eggplants prepared certain ways can cause a very light but noticeable 
stinging sensation in the mouth. This is normal and harmless.</p>

<p>Claims have been made that arthritis symptoms were relieved by removal 
of all nightshades (eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, etc.) from the diet, but 
these claims have not been confirmed by any controlled study.</p>

<p>Much anti-nightshade propaganda originates from the Michio Kushi 
Macrobiotics movement - much more religion than science. They claim all 
nightshades (eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, chilis, etc.) are highly toxic 
and will ruin your health in short order. If there was any truth to that 
I'd have died decades ago.</p>

<p>Populations with heavy eggplant consumption, particularly India, do not 
appear to be suffering population decline nor any other ailment that can 
be attributed to eggplants.</p>
