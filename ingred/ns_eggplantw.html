<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Eggplants (<i>Solanum melongena</i>) are a truly great 
vegetable (actually, a fruit), practically worshiped over much of the 
world. It is, though, rather neglected by Americans - probably because 
they haven't learned how to cook them. As you will see below, it really 
isn't hard to do.

<h2 id="gen">Selecting Eggplants</h2>

<p>In all cases eggplants should be bright in color and without bruises and 
in particular without brown spots or dents which indicate they've been stored 
too long. Select eggplants heavy for their size because this indicates a 
young fruit which will have better texture than an older one.</p>

<p>As you can see from the <a href="ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant 
Page</b></a> there are quite a few varieties. Most, however, are quite 
similar in flavor, texture and cooking properties so selection of 
variety is often a matter of what size and shape fits the recipe 
best.</p>

<p>The exceptions to interchangeability are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Globe Eggplants</b> have tough skins that generally need to be 
    peeled so they don't substitute well for small eggplants where the 
    peel is generally part of the recipe.</li>
  <li><b>White Eggplants</b> have tough skins and need to be peeled which 
    makes them unsuitable for many recipes calling for small eggplants.
    </li>
  <li><b>Thai Eggplants</b> remain much firmer than others when cooked so 
    if you have to substitute Indian or Asian eggplants keep the cooking 
    time to a minimum and treat them gently.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="male">"Male" <small>&amp;</small> "Female" Eggplants</h2>

<p>Many chefs, cooking sites and cookbooks instruct you on how to tell 
a "male" eggplant from a "female" eggplant. These people all need a 
refresher course in sex education,  and perhaps remedial biology.</p>
<p>Eggplants are fruit. They do not and can not have sex - they are the 
product of sex in the flower. Eggplant flowers are all both male and 
female, and the fruit is a product of the female part of the flower - no 
exceptions.</p>
<p>It is claimed "male" eggplants have a small round flower scar, 
have fewer seeds and are "less bitter". "Female" eggplants are said to 
have a larger, elongated flower scar, more seeds and more "bitter 
juices". Most say to buy only the "male" ones, but a few advisors get 
it the other way around.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not yet convinced eggplants actually have "bitter juices", 
but as for the quantity of seeds, there may be some truth in this flower 
scar theory. Those with a stretched out scar may have been more 
thoroughly pollinated, thus more seeds. It is not, however, from gender 
differentiation.</p>

<h2 id="peel">Cutting</h2>

<p>Many sources recommend cutting eggplants only with stainless or 
ceramic knives to avoid discoloration. I haven't bothered to verify 
this since good stainless knives are much more common than carbon steel 
knives these days, but be informed.</p>

<p>Before peeling or cutting eggplant, prepare a big bowl of water with a 
teaspoon of citric acid or juice of a lemon in it and a teaspoon of salt. 
Cut surfaces should be immediately plunged into this water and kept wet 
to avoid browning and becoming ugly.<p>

<h2>Peeling</h2>

<p>Eggplants do not always have to be peeled. In particular the smaller 
sizes and long thin ones are usually not peeled, but the large globe 
eggplants and white eggplants have thicker skins and are often peeled. 
Eggplants for stuffing are not peeled regardless of size.</p>

<p>Eggplants present a much more difficult peeling problem than their 
relatives the peppers and tomatoes. The butane blowtorch which works so 
well on peppers doesn't work. Scalding, which does a great 
job on tomatoes doesn't work at all. Paring knives are hard to 
control and tend to take way too much eggplant.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Peeler Method:</h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; I find this the best 
solution in most cases. You don't have to heat up the broiler or have 
hot coals ready. I prefer a very sharp "Y" shaped peeler rather than the 
straight models. Some of these are designed for vegetables with a much 
smaller diameter than a big globe eggplant so they may have feet at the 
corners that keep the blade from contacting the skin. These feet can be 
cut or filed off. The one I use is the Titan brand, extremely sharp and 
does an excellent job.<p></p>

<h3>Broiler / Grill Method:</h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; This method 
chars the skin under a preheated broiler or over a charcoal or gas grill. 
This also cooks the eggplant quite deeply, even all the way through. 
The charred skin can contribute flavor to the eggplant which may be 
desirable, depending on recipe. Of course, if you grill over charcoal 
you'll impart even more flavor. <b>Do Not</b> attempt to char the 
eggplant over a stovetop gas burner - this doesn't work even as well 
as the blowtorch.<p></p> 

<p>Generally you will split the eggplant lengthwise and place the halves 
cut side down on an oiled foil, then slide under the broiler. You can do 
narrow eggplants whole if you need to by turning during broiling. I find 
this method works much better if you lightly oil the skins before 
broiling. Once they have become wrinkled and the eggplant is cooked through, 
cool it enough to handle and pull the skin off in lengthwise strips. 
Start your strip thin, just the skin, because it'll maintain the starting 
depth for the full length. A thick peel will compromise the integrity of 
your eggplant.</p>

<h2 id="salt">Salting</h2>

<p>Many sources say to salt eggplant slices or cubes and let them sweat 
for 1/2 hour to an hour "to draw out the bitter juices".  I am not 
convinced that eggplants have any bitter juices or that this treatment 
would draw them out if they did.</p>

<p>Salting does, however, perform a very useful function. If you are 
going to fry the eggplant in oil this treatment greatly reduces the 
amount of oil that will be absorbed. Unsalted eggplant is an oil sponge 
without peer.</p>

<p>First give the eggplant the citric acid bath as described under cutting 
and peeling, then drain and salt it liberally. Let the eggplant sweat in a 
glass or stainless bowl for between 1/2 and 1 hour, turning now and then. 
Finally rinse the eggplant in several changes of warm water until it does 
not taste too salty.</p> 

<h2 id="stuff">Stuffing</h2>

<p><img src="img/ke_butcurl01c.jpg" alt="Hollowed" class=mrg>
Eggplants are a favorite vegetable for stuffing all over the world, and 
in all sizes from chicken egg to football. They may be sliced lengthwise, 
crosswise or just the stem end cut off and the flesh scooped out. This 
flesh is often returned as part of the stuffing.</p>
<p>There is one nearly perfect tool for hollowing out eggplants quickly 
and without damage - it's called a "butter curler" (and you can use it 
for curling butter too!).</p>
<p>Start by cutting the eggplant in the direction the recipe calls for. 
Then outline the area to be scooped out with a small sharp knife cutting 
as deep as is safe. Then take the butter curler and scoop away. until 
you've worked out to the knife cut.</p>
<p>As you work plunge the pieces you remove into a bowl filled with water 
acidulated with citric acid or lemon juice with some salt added. This 
will keep it from browning and looking ugly. When you are through with 
the scooping rinse out the shell with the same acidulated water to 
prevent it from browning.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cook">Cooking</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Pan Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes call for a horrifying amount of 
olive oil. The specified amount can often be cut in half if you salt the 
eggplant pieces. 
<p>In general you'll want to use Pure Olive Oil, not Extra Virgin. You 
could keep the frying temperature low enough for extra virgin, but even 
salted eggplant will absorb so much oil that extra virgin is likely to 
be overpowering.</p>

<ol>
<li>Peel Eggplants and cut less than 1/2 inch thick, into steaks or 
  squares.</li>
<li>Salt Eggplants lightly and set aside for about 30 minutes, tumbling 
  a couple of times.</li>
<li>Rinse until not noticeably salty. Squeeze gently and drain well. 
  A salad spinner is a great help here.</li> 
<li>Heat about 1 Tablespoon of Oil, or a little more depending on the 
  size of your pan, to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li> 
<li>Fry Eggplant in batches so they aren't crowded. When browned on one 
  side, turn with a thin turner and brown the other side. Turning 
  several times won't hurt. Add more oil between batches as needed.</li>
<li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Oven Roasting:</h3> &nbsp; This method is more reliable than pan 
frying, and the eggplant ends up with a lot less oil.
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 420&deg;F/215&deg;C.</li>
<li>Peel Eggplants and cut 3/4 to 1 inch thick, into steaks or cubes.
  </li>
<li>Salt Eggplants lightly and set aside for about 30 minutes, tumbling 
  a couple of times.</li>
<li>Rinse until not noticeably salty. Squeeze gently and drain well. 
  A salad spinner is a great help here.</li>  
<li>Tumble the Eggplant pieces with Olive Oil to coat reasonably well.
  </li> 
<li>Lay slices or steaks in a single layer on oiled foil on a baking 
  sheet.</li>
<li>Roast them for about 20 minutes or until nicely browned, turning 
  them once, or tumbling a couple times for smaller cubes.</li>
</ol>

<p>When combining foods keep in mind that eggplant is sweet - sometimes 
overpoweringly sweet.</p>
