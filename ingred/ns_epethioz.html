<h1>African / Ethiopian Eggplant</h1>
<p>[Nakati; <i>Solanum aethiopicum</i>]</p>
<p>
Technically not an eggplant, but very closely related, this nightshade 
is native to Africa, though it has been taken to India and Southeast 
Asia as well as the Caribbean and South America. There are many 
cultivars and land races of this species which vary considerably in 
fruit size, shape and color.</p>

(French); khamen akhaba (Manipuri, India); Samtawk (Mizoram, India)]
<p>
These eggplants are well known in the markets of Senegal and elsewhere 
in West Africa. They are usually eaten green, but are bright orange 
when fully ripe.  They are often made into sauces similar to tomato 
sauces. &nbsp; <u>Subst</u>: probably Thai Eggplants would be good, 
but they are rather less bitter.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; In North America, seeds are available. Fresh 
eggplants are grown in North America but you will be very lucky to 
find them even on-line. Small fully orange ones on stems have been 
found in Los Angeles sold as decorative "pumpkin trees".</p>

[<i>Solanum aethiopicum</i> var <i>gilo</i>]
<p>
These eggplants are very popular in West Africa, particularly Nigeria. 
Most are white, but yellow and purple ones are also available.
The leaves are also eaten (see <a href="ns_epethioz.html#geleaf">Garden Egg Leaves</a> 
below).	Note that <a href="ns_epvietz.html"><b>Gboma</b> 
(<i>Solanum macrocarpon</i>)</a> may also be called Garden Egg and used 
in the same ways, including the leaves.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; In North America, seeds are available. Fresh 
eggplants are grown in North America for sale in African oriented 
markets, but availability is still rather scanty. They are more 
common in the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Liberian White Eggplant</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_eplibwht02f.jpg" alt="Liberian White Eggplants, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Garden Eggs, Bitter Balls, <i>Solanum aethiopicum</i> var <i>gilo</i>]
<p>
This variety is from Liberia in West Africa. They can be Eaten raw, but 
have a strong raw eggplant taste and are noticeably bitter. Cooked when 
white, they have a moderately sweet herbal taste, with mild bitterness. 
Cut in half, they are fully tender simmered 10 minutes, and have very 
thin skins which are edible. They are most often simmered with seasonings 
into sauces simalarly to tomato sauces. When fully ripe, they are bright 
red, but not very edible, filled with hard seeds. My plants were prolific 
in their first year, but produced very small eggplants. The photo 
specimens are from the second year, and of a much more useful size. 
The largest was 1.6 inches diamter and 1 inch high, weighting 3/4 
ounce.</p>

Young Garden Egg Leaves are a popular green in West Africa and are quite 
nutritious, though fairly bitter.  Leaves are always cooked, either as 
a side dish or included in soups and stews. The bitter flavor comes 
from toxic alkaloids, so it is recommended to not over-indulge in this 
plant, though cooking does reduce the toxins.
