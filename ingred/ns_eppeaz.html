This close relative of the eggplant, producing fruit about 0.4 inch 
diameter, is native to the Americas, from Florida through the Caribbean 
and from Mexico south into Brazil. It has been naturalized throughout 
the tropics and can be a serious pest in some environments (the plants 
grow large and have lots of thorns). The berries grow in clusters, and 
are usually picked green, but can ripen to yellow and bright red.</p>
<p>While somewhat more bitter than the green Thai eggplant, the pea 
eggplant is used in many cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia and 
southern India. It has a significant place in the cuisines of Tamil Nadu. 
The fruits are used both fresh, and slit and dried. I have not seen 
these for sale here in Los Angeles.

<p>Seeds are easily available on line, but I've tried growing from 
seeds from the Caribbean and from Thailand. In both cases, the plants 
grew into small trees, and flowerd profusely, but produced only 2 to 
4 eggplants per year. Perhaps their polination conditions aren't met 
here in Southern California. I tried hand polinating, but that didn't 
work either. I see that they are successfully grown in the Midwest.</p>
