<h1>Thai Eggplant / Nandyala Eggplant</h1>
<br><img src="img/ns_epthai13f.jpg" alt="Typical Thai Eggplants" class=mrg>

Vankayalu (India - Telugu); <i>Solanum melongena</i>]</p>
<p>
These unique, easy to identify eggplants are growing in popularity and 
now widely available in California and the Southwest. They stay 
noticeably firmer than other eggplants when cooked so can take longer 
cooking and more abuse. These eggplants are never peeled. They are 
usually between 1-1/2 and 2-1/4 inches diameter and weigh up to 2-3/4 
ounces. When cut, the seeds should be very light beige (the photo shows 
the darkest acceptable). If they are dark the eggplant is old and will 
be bitter.</p>
<p>Those grown in California are mainly green stripes over white or light 
green background, but some white are grown here. In Thailand yellow and 
light purple versions are also sold. An elongated light green Thai 
eggplant similar in appearance to the Japanese eggplant, except for 
color, is not yet available here.</p>
<p>These eggplants are also the predominant variety grown in Andhra 
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in southeastern India, particularly around 
Nandyala. The Indian version tends to be a bit more elongated than the 
Thai, but the coloration and cooking properties are the same. Natives 
of the region living in California find the Thai variety quite 
acceptable.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; It's pretty much impossible to tell from the 
outside if one is overaged, so buy from a vendor with high turnover, and 
buy some extras in case some are too old. Use them as soon as possible, 
as they will continue to age even in the fridge. Again, the cut one in 
the photo above is the darkest acceptable for use - lighter is better.
