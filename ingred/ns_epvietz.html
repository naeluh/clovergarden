Technically not an eggplant, but very closely related, this nightshade 
originated in West Africa. It has been introduced into Central and East 
Africa, the Caribbean, South America and parts of Southeast Asia.
There are many cultivars and land races of this species which vary 
considerably in fruit size. The photo specimen has very long calyx lobes 
but some have medium or short lobes. Unripe the fruit may be green, 
white, or purple, but generally ripens to yellow or yellow-brown.They 
are most commonly harvested unripe and eaten raw or cooked, though 
they are slightly bitter.

<p> In Vietnam they are used in stir fries and soups. They are also 
eaten raw and pickled.</p>

<p>In West Africa they are used the same as 
<a href="ns_epethioz.html"><b>Garden Eggs</b></a>, including eating 
the leaves. Leaves are always cooked. The bitter flavor comes from 
toxic alkaloids, so it is recommended to not over-indulge in this 
plant, though cooking does reduce the toxins.</p>
