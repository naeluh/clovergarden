<h2 class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>American Nightshade</h2>

<br><img src="img/ns_america01h.jpg" alt="Fruiting American Nightshade" class=mrg>
[Branched Kalaloo (Caribbean); <i>Solanum americanum</i>]
<p>This plant is very widespread and rather variable in appearance, so 
it is easily confused with other nightshades that produce black berries. 
It is native to the temperate Americas, Australia, New Guinea and 
Melanesia, and has been introduced to Hawaii, Southeast Asia, Africa and 
Madagascar. Unripe berries are highly toxic, with black berries less so, 
but toxicity is highly variable.</p>
<p>In some regions the berries are cooked and made into jams. Young 
leaves and shoots are cooked as greens in many regions. The cooking 
water is discarded because it contains the water soluble toxins. It is 
one of the greens used in the Caribbean in callaloo, a stew of leafy 
greens famous in the region, but originating in West Africa.

<br><img src="img/ns_ashwa01h.jpg" alt="Poison Gooseberry" class=mrg>
[Poison Gooseberry, Winter Cherry, Indian Ginseng; 
  <i>Withania somnifera</i>]
<p>
This plant is most known from Indian ayurvedic medicine where the root 
is used for a number of symptoms, while fruit and leaves are used 
externally as a poultice. The fruit does, however, have a culinary 
application as well, it can be used in place of rennet to curdle milk 
in making vegetarian cheese.</p>
<p>The very closely related <i>Withania coagulans</i> (Ashutosh booti, 
Indian rennet, panirband, vegetable rennet) is more commonly used. 
Very little need be used, so the various toxic alkaloids should not 
be a problem.

<h2>Black Nightshade</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_black01h.jpg" alt="Black Nightshade Fruit on Plant" class=mrg>
[Garden Nightshade, Garden Huckleberry, Hound's Berry, Wonder Berry; 
  <i>Solanum nigrum</i>]
<p>Native to Eurasia, this plant has been introduced into the 
Americas, Australasia and South Africa. Ripe berries and cooked leaves 
are eaten, but care must be taken because toxicity varies widely from 
one variety to another. Unripe berries of many varieties are quite toxic, 
though rarely fatal. While most varieties produce berries ripening to 
black, some produce red or orange berries.</p>
<p>Black Nightshade berries were once a popular pie filling in Europe. 
Since the berries were gathered wild with uncertain toxicity, they 
were given a long cooking time to detoxify. Leaves and berries are eaten 
in Greece, Turkey, Indonesia and much of Africa, generally cultivated 
varieties with low toxicity. The greens of more toxic varieties are 
cooked in several changes of water. The discarded water carries away 
water soluble toxins.

<h2>Bush Tomatoes</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ns_bushtom01h.jpg" alt="Bush Tomatoes on Plant" class=mrg>
[Desert Raisin, Kutjera, Bush Sultana: <i>Solanum centrale</i> &nbsp; 
  | &nbsp; very similar "Bush Tomatoes": &nbsp;  Potato Bush; 
  <i>Solanum ellipticum</i> | Potato Bush; <i>Solanum ellipticum</i> 
  | Wild Tomato; <i>Solanum quadriloculatum</i>]
<p>All the wild Australian "bush tomatoes" are very similar arid 
climate shrubs bearing small round fruit. Berries of all were gathered 
by the aboriginal people and eaten raw or cooked.<p>
<p>The most important 
currently is the Desert Raisin, which is in small scale cultivation 
by aboriginal communities in central Australia and sold commercially. 
The fruit can be allowed to dry on the bush and will look like raisins. 
The flavor is strong and similar to Tamarillo and Caramel. They are 
particularly favored for making sauces and condiments, and are 
available whole, or ground as Kutjera Powder.

<h2>Cocona</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_cocona01h.jpg" alt="Cocona Fruit, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Solanum sessiliflorum</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the Amazon Rainforest, particularly in Peru, 
and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit. The fruit can be red, 
yellow or orange, and tastes like a blend of tomato and lemon. It is 
closely related to the Naranjilla and Pseudolulo.

[Jimson Weed, Devil's weed, Devil's cucumber, Thorn-apple, Pricklyburr, 
  Angel's trumpet and Devil's trumpet, <i>Datura stramonium</i>, also 
  similar <i>Datura wrightii</i>]
<p>
A common weed here in Southern California, this plant is far more deadly 
than the Deadly Nightshade. It's mind altering powers are so awesome 
even people heavily into "recreational substances" have generally 
shunned it. All parts of the plant are highly toxic, and the margin 
between an effective dose and death is narrow.

<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Deadly Nightshade</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_atropa01k.jpg" alt="Deadly Nightshade Berries on Plant" class=mrg>
[Bella Donna; <i>Atropa belladonna</i>]
<p>Native to Western Europe, North Africa and Western Asia, this is 
one of the most toxic of Old World plants. It has been introduced into 
North America. All parts of the plant are highly toxic, but most 
intensely the roots and berries. Nightshade eyedrops were once used by 
Italian Renaissance beauties to dilate the pupils of their eyes, thus 
the name "Bella Donna".  The active ingredient, the toxin atropine is 
still used for dilation, but not for eye exams because the effect is 
too long lasting,</p>
<p>Death by belladonna is not pleasant, but preferable to strychnine. 
The antidote to nightshade poisoning is Physostigmine, originally 
extracted from the West African Calabar Bean. It must be administered 
with care, as it's just as deadly as the nightshade. Calabar Bean 
poisoning is likewise treated with extracts of the Deadly Nightshade.

<h2>Garden Huckleberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_scabrum01h.jpg" alt="Garden Huckleberry plant with ripe fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Solanum scabrum</i>]
<p>This plant is found in Africa and North America, with uncertain 
origin. In Africa it is grown in two varieties, one for leaves used as 
a common potherb, and one for ripe fruit, used to make a purple dye.

<h2>Indian Nightshade</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_india02h.jpg" alt="Solanum lasiocarpum with Fruit" class=mrg>
[hairy-fruited eggplant; <i>Solanum lasiocarpum</i> syn <i>Solanum ferox</i>]
<p>Note that there are other plants also called "Indian Nightshade". 
This plant is found wild in parts of South Asia but is mostly found in 
cultivation. Cultivated varieties bear larger fruit that lacks the prickles 
on the wild fruit.  The flowers are white, and fruits, when ripe, are pale 
yellow and light green in the center. In India it is used as a sour relish in 
curries. In Thailand it is used to make a variety of Nam Prik, a table 
condiment. It is of interest to botanists for interbreeding with South 
American species, particularly naranjilla.

<h2>Naranjillo</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_naranj01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Naranjillas" class=mrg>
[Lulo (Colombia); <i>Solanum quitoense</i>]
<p>Native to northwestern South America, this nightshade is a 
moderate size perennial with large fuzzy green and purple leaves. It is 
favored for its tomato like fruit, which is described as having a flavor 
similar to rhubarb and lime. It is much used to make the beverage Lulada 
in Colombia.</p>
<p>This plant is challenging in large scale cultivation because 
it is vulnerable to wind and too much direct sunlight. It is also quite 
vulnerable to pests, particularly nematodes. Hybrids with other 
<i>Solanum</i> species are now common for resistance to nematodes.

[Cows Udder; Fox Face (Japan); Five Fingered Eggplant (China); 
  <i>Solanum mammosum</i>]
<p>Native to the Tropical Americas, this nightshade has been 
much adopted for festival decorations in Asia, particularly China. 
The plant is toxic, but immature fruits are cooked and eaten as a 
vegetable. In the Philippines fruit is cooked and eaten, while the 
leaves are steeped into a tea considered to relieve pain.

[Paneer booti, Ashutosh booti (India); Rishyagandha (Sanskrit); 
<i>Withania coagulans</i> syn <i>Puneeria coagulans</i>]
<p>This nightshade is native to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Indian 
Subcontinent. The berries contain a rennet-like protease, which makes them 
useful in India for coagulating milk for cheese production. The photo is 
actually the very similar <i>Withania frutescens</i>, as no suitable photos 
of <i>coagulans</i> were available - but <i>coagulans</i> fruits are in 
clusters rather than solitary.

<h2>Pepino</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_pepino01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Pepinos" class=mrg>
[Pepino dulce; <i>Solanum muricatum</i>]
<p>Native to western South America from Colombia to Chile, this 
nightshade shrub produces sweet melon-like fruit. While still rare, 
some are grown in California and Hawaii. Recently introduced varieties 
developed in New Zealand may result in increased availability (and 
lower prices) here in North America.

[Lulo de Perro; <i>Solanum pseudolulo</i>]
<p>This plant is native to northwestern South America. It is rarely 
cultivated because it is such a common weed, though some botanists 
think it can be developed into a crop. It is considered less desirable 
than the true Lulo (Naranjilla), but can grow in full sun, while that 
plant needs the protection of part shade.

[Tree Tomato; Tamamoro, 
  Tomate de &aacute;rbol (South America); Tammatar, Ram Bheda (Nepal); 
  <i>Solanum betaceum</i>]
<p>Native to the Andean region of South America from Colombia to Chile, 
this is one of the most popular fruits in the region. It is now also 
grown in the United States, parts of Africa, the Himalayan foothills, 
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and the Philippines, mostly at higher 
elevations. The plant can grow to 16 feet tall and bear fruit for 
about 12 years.</p>
<p>The egg shaped fruit ranges from 1-1/2 to 4 inches in length. Yellow 
and Orange varieties are sweeter, red varieties more tart and savory. 
Their fruit is most commonly halved lengthwise and eaten with a spoon, 
though in New Zealand it is often spread on toast. In the Andean 
region it is chopped up with chilis to make a table condiment. The 
condiment is called "Aji", but so are most other chili containing 
table condiments in the region. Elsewhere, the fruit is often included 
in sauces, stews, chutneys and curries.

<h2 id="tobac">Tobacco</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_tobacc01c.jpg" alt="Flowering Tobacco Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>]
<p>A nightshade native to the Americas but now cultivated in temperate 
climates worldwide. The leaves contain unusually high amounts of the toxic 
alkaloid Nicotine, considered one of the most addictive drugs known to 
man. Because the delivery systems for this drug, cigars, cigarettes, 
pipes, chews, etc. are traditional (natives of the Americas started 
smoking tobacco cigars over 2000 years ago) it is legal.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry promotes tobacco delivery systems in many subtle, 
not so subtle and insidious ways resulting in a huge base of addicts. 
Being legal, tobacco products can be, and are, taxed up the wazoo because 
the addicts will pay almost any price for them. This assures that tobacco 
will not be made illegal, though the health costs may exceed the revenue.

<h2>Tomate Salvaje</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_sibundoy01h.jpg" alt="Sibundoyense Fruit on Plant" class=mrg>
[Tomate Silvestre (Colombia); <i>Solanum sibundoyense</i>]
<p>Native to the cloud forests of Colombia, this small tree, up to 
26 feet high, produces fairly large edible fruit. The fruit varies from 
sweet and juicy to acid depending on the tree, and is transportable with 
decent shelf life . The Tomate Salvaje is experimental in cultivation. 
New Zealand growers have found it needs part shade to fruit well. The 
fruit in the photo is not yet ripe.

  tea tree (UK); Tibetan Goji, Himalayan Goji (health food stores); 
  Matrimony Vine; <i>Lycium barbarum</i> &amp; <i>Lycium chinense</i>]
<p>Native to somewhere around Turkey and Eastern Europe wolfberries are 
now grown worldwide and particularly in China, the main commercial 
supplier. The berry tastes similar to dried cranberries but is more tart 
and tastes somewhat of tomato, not surprising since tomatoes are also 
nightshades. They have strong antioxidant properties and may be helpful 
in preventing vision problems.
