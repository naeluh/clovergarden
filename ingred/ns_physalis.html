<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Physalis, often called "husk tomatoes" is a worldwide 
genus of the prolific Nightshade (<i>Solanaceae</i>) family. Best known 
are the Tomatillo or "Mexican Green Tomato", important for Mexican sauces, 
and the Chinese Lantern (photo) which is grown purely for decoration 
and is one of the few that can survive through freezing winters.</span>

<p>The decorative Chinese Lantern is native to Southern Europe 
through Japan, but it is South America Physalis varieties that first 
became significant as food and are now grown in a number of countries.
</p>
<p>The Peruvian Ground Cherry was being grown as a crop in South Africa 
by 1807. Still a commercial crop there, it is used for canned fruit and 
made into jams. Now carrying the name "Cape Gooseberry", it was carried 
to New Zealand and Australia and is grown on a  fairly large scale in 
both those countries. It is, however, still very rare in North America.
</p>
<p>The Tomatillo, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have caught on much 
outside the Americas, but it's so common here it's even sold by the big 
supermarket chains - though you'll find far better prices at local and 
ethnic markets.</p>

<p>
Native to Chile and Peru, this nightshade berry is now most noted 
for commercial production in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It 
is an incidental crop in South America and so far rarely seen in North 
America. Cape Gooseberry can be grown most places where tomatoes can be 
grown but warmer is better since the plants can take only a couple 
degrees of frost. Mature fruits are between 1/2 and 1 inch diameter. 
The largest of the photo specimens, from Colombia, was 0.9 inch. 
They were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
for 2016 US $7.97 / pound. The husks are large and loose, unlike the 
tight husks of the tomatillo, so they are sold with husks removed.</p>
  
<p>These fruits are slightly sticky, like tomatillos and have a flavor 
similar to a mix of strawberry, pineapple and tomato. The main commercial 
uses of Cape Gooseberry are as canned fruit and for making jam, but 
fancy restaurants often use whole fruits as an exotic garnish. In homes 
they are made into pies and are eaten whole as fruit. The berries, left 
in their husks, store well, over a month in cool dry conditions. 
<b>Caution:</b> unripe fruit are toxic so eat no green berries.

<p>
Tomatillos are native to Mexico and were well developed as a crop by the 
Aztecs. Our first evidence of cultivation is from around 800 BCE but it 
was probably grown far earlier than that.</p>
<p>Tomatillos are harvested when medium to light green and used at that 
stage of ripeness. The variety commonly sold in Southern California is 
yellow when fully ripe but there are varieties that ripen to red and 
purple. Much used in Mexican green sauces tomatillos are both tart and sweet. 
There is no satisfactory substitute. 
<p>The photo specimens are typical, averaging around 2-1/4 inches diameter 
and 2-3/4 ounces, but they can be much smaller in some markets. The largest 
I've seen was 3-1/3 inches diameter and 6-5/8 ounces.

<p>
Native to the Old World from Southern Europe, across southern 
Asia to Japan, this Physalis is edible but not much used as food, at 
least in recent times. It is a common decorative plant and can tolerate 
much colder winters than most Physalis can.  When the paper-like husk 
dries out, it becomes lace-like, and the now visible ripe red berry 
drops into the bottom of it.

<p>
Native to North America from Eastern Canada through much of the United 
States and into northern Mexico, this yellow-green berry was used by 
American Indians, particularly the Pueblos. The berries were eaten 
fresh, cooked and dried. Fresh they have been described as tasting like 
an "effervescent, under-ripened strawberry", and dried as similar to 
a mix of raisin and dried cranberry. Today, tomatillos are used for 
most of the traditional recipes that had used this berry, but trials 
have shown it is easy to grow and produces flavorful fruit.

This plant is grown in drier regions of India, and to a lesser extent in 
Nepal, China and Yemen. Its berries can be used as a vegetarian 
substitute for rennet in cheese making, but it is more famous for its 
use in Ayurvedic medicine. Medicinally, it is the leaves that are used, 
not the berry. This plant has recently been adopted by the herbal 
supplement industry as an inexpensive substitute for 
<a href="py_ginsez.html">Ginseng</a>. It is particularly promoted for 
treatment and prevention of cancers, diabetes, stress, inflammation and 
neurological conditions.
