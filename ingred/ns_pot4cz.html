[Wild Potato; <i>Solanum jamesii</i>]
<p>
This tuberous plant is not precisely a Potato, but a species very 
closely related  to potatoes.These tubers have been used as a food source 
by native tribes in the American Southwest for at least 10,000 years, 
and probably became a cultivated crop very early, but an exact date has 
yet to be established. They are still used today as a food crop by tribes 
living in the Four Corners region of the United States, and surrounding 
areas. They are very small, only up to about 1-1/4 inches, but the plants 
are prolific. The tubers are also very bitter, so need special cooking.
Archaeologists have found they were also dried and ground into flour in 
ancient times.</p>
<p>These plants grow leaves on very thin stems, so have a somewhat 
recumbent growth pattern. Different tubers may grow with very different 
degrees of enthusiasm. Some will grow very fast and be flowering in just 
a couple of weeks, others may grow much more slowly, and some will be 
reluctant to sprout for some time.</p>

<p>The photo to the left is of Potatoes from the photo batch at 3-1/2 
weeks from planting. Note that some are much smaller. At 4 weeks, the 
largest ones were already setting flowers.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is pretty much a "grow it yourself" crop, 
but tubers are sometimes available from 
<a href="https://www.cultivariable.com/"><b>Cultivarial</b></a>, where 
you can also find growing instructions. The photo specimens shipped to me 
were already sprouting.</p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; These tubers have good storage properties, as 
in their native environment they may have to wait years for rain. Getting 
them to sprout after a long dormancy may take some patience.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These potatoes are very bitter due to 
glycoalkaloids, so are boiled with bentonite clay, which sweetens them 
and removes toxins, making them edible. This clay is called 
<i>gl&emacr;sh</i> by the Navajo, meaning "Potato clay", and is available 
on-line as it has various health and cosmetic properties. I have not yet 
determined how much clay is needed in a batch.
