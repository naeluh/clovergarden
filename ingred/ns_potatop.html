<span class=bg>It isn't all junk food - a number of potato products are 
useful to the cook. Pringles, however, (photo) <u>are</u> junk food, and 
taste pretty awful, but the cans they come in have served well as high

networks or stealing Internet time.</span>

<h2 id="starch">Potato Starch</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potstrch01h.jpg" alt="Small Pile of Potato Starch" class=mrg>
Potato starch is a superior thickener that should be used in place of 
cornstarch (UK cornflour) for most applications. You can use only 2/3 as 
much for the same thickening power and the flavor is more neutral letting 
the flavor of other ingredients shine through.
<p>Potato starch has no gluten and is safe for celiacs and persons 
with wheat allergies. It can be used as a coating for fried products with 
better browning properties than rice flour.</p>
<p><b>Don't Do:</b> &nbsp; Many Chinese recipes (and some Western recipes) 
coat meat, fish, fowl or other foods with cornstarch before frying. The 
cornstarch keeps the food from sticking to the pan - but also <i>thickens 
the sauce</i> when the items are simmered with liquids after frying. 
Coating with the more powerful potato starch will then require a lot more 
liquid resulting in a larger amount of less flavorful sauce than you 
probably want.</p>
<p>Potato starch is becoming easier to find. Practically every ethnic market 
has it, usually packaged in plastic bags, but it may still be hard to find 
in supermarkets.

<h2 id="imash">Instant Mashed Potatoes</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potflak01h.jpg" alt="Pile of Potato Flakes" class=mrg>
These come in two forms, flakes and granules or pearls. The granular 
variety is sold mostly for institutional and restaurant use and provides 
a superior result. Flakes are sold in the supermarkets for home use and 
are quicker. Nutrition is similar to fresh mashed potatoes except for 
almost total loss of Vitamin C.
<p>In addition to the obvious use, faking up mashed potatoes, these 
products are used as a thickening ingredient in some recipes.</p>
<p>Dehydrated potato flakes are also a big item for survivalists awaiting 
nuclear winter and for Mormons uncomfortable with the idea of depending 
on seagulls.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="chip">Potato Chips</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potchp01e.jpg" alt="Pile of Potato Chips" class=mrg>
Aside from being an extremely fattening snack, potato chips are sometimes 
crumbled and used as a coating for fish or fowl and sometimes meat. The 
objective is to have a fried flavor to the crust even though the coated 
items are actually baked in the oven.
<p>The photo specimens were from Frito-Lay, a company that has participated 
in developing a number of potato cultivars specific to their processing 
needs. Potatoes, Sunflower Oil and/or Corn Oil, Salt. The color is uniformly 
very light, probably to minimize formation of acrylamide.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="froze">Frozen Potato Products</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potfroz01e.jpg" alt="Frozen Potatoes, various forms" class=mrg>
Frozen French fries, baked potatoes, potato rounds, cut wedges, dice, 
hash brown patties and many other shapes. These are most used in 
institutional service and fast food restaurants but some shapes also 
appear in supermarkets for home cooks pressed for preparation time.
<p>Whole baked potatoes and chunks of baked potatoes as well as frozen 
mashed potatoes are all available to the restaurant and frozen dinner 
trades.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="vodka">Vodka</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potvod05c.jpg" alt="Tiny Glass of Vodka" class=mrg>
By no means is all vodka made from potatoes, but a fair amount is, 
particularly in Poland where potato vodka was invented around 1800.
