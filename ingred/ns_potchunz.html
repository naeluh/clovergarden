These freeze dried potatoes have been produced by the Inca and Tiwanaku 
cultures for about 5000 years (that we know of). Frost resistant potato 
varieties are frozen by night and thawed by day for several days, then 
trampled under foot to squeeze out water and remove the skins. For a few 
more days they are let to freeze by night and sun dry by day. White 
chu&ntilde;o is washed between freezings and black chu&ntilde;o is not.</p>
<p>Chu&ntilde;o can be stored for more than a decade, and has been a survival 
essential in the high Altiplano region. It remains important to traditional 
recipes throughout Bolivia and Peru. Production is now threatened by global 
warming, as the nights are no longer cold enough. This is very worrisome to 
folks in the villages.</p>

<p>Chu&ntilde;o can be cooked and eaten whole, or broken up, and can also be 
ground into flour for use as a thickener in soups.</p>

<h3>Black Chu&ntilde;o</h3> &nbsp; These are made by the same method as 
White Chu&ntilde;o, except the multiple washings are not done. The white is 
more commercial, but the black is easier to make and usually eaten by the 
farmers.

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; These potatoes are available in a few markets serving 
a South American community, but can be easily purchased on-line. Typical 
pricing is 2022 US $11.53 for 15 ounces, or $19.45 for three 15 ounce packs.
<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; These dried potatoes will last decades in a tightly 
sealed container kept in a cool dry place.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; First they should be soaked overnight. For soups 
and stews, I usually break them up a bit with a blow from a kitchen mallet.
Then they need to be simmered in water for 10 minutes or so. After this, 
they look more like potato, but have a slightly nutty taste and are a 
little crisp in texture. Chu&ntilde;o is not considered interchangeable 
with fresh potatoes in recipes, and some recipes include both.
