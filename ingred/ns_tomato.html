<h1>Tomatoes</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Tomatoes are members of the prolific (and promiscuous) 
Nightshade Family (<i>Solanaceae</i>), They were were originally assigned 
as <i>S. Solanum lycopersicum</i>. Later botanists gave them a separate 
genus as <i>Lycopersicon esculentum</i> (corrected to <i>Lycopersicon 
lycopersicum</i>) but modern genetics has sent them back to  <i>Solanum 
lycopersicum</i>. None of this confusion seems to have greatly hindered 
the tomato's acceptance in culinary circle.</span>

<h2 id="hist">History <small>&amp;</small> General Discussion</h2>

<p>Tomatoes are clearly a fruit, botanically. In culinary practice 
they are a vegetable (botany doesn't define "vegetable", so botanists 
can't complain about this). In 1893 the US Supreme Court ruled that 
tomatoes are a vegetable and the US Department of Agriculture classifies 
them as such.</p>

<p>The wild ancestor of domesticated tomatoes is native to Peru and 
Ecuador,  They were grown as a crop in both areas by 500 BCE 
and probably a lot earlier.</p>

<p>The Spanish took tomatoes to the Philippines, from where they spread 
to Southeast Asia. They also took them to the Caribbean and to Spain, 
where cultivation began in about 1540. From there they spread to Italy. 
Some of these early varieties were yellow or orange, resulting 
in the name "golden apples" in several languages.</p>

<p>When I was in elementary school in New Jersey, our teachers told us 
Europeans were so ignorant they thought tomatoes were poisonous. They 
were far less ignorant than our teachers, immediately recognizing 
tomatoes as a close relative of the sometimes deadly Black Nightshade. 
That didn't stop them from eating them though. By 1544 they were 
described as edible and as "a new variety of eggplant" (another 
nightshade berry that was initially suspect). Americans were more 
ignorant, though, and didn't accept tomatoes as edible until about 
1850.</p>

<p>Early tomato sauces were simmered for a long time because that's how 
Europeans were accustomed to detoxifying Black Nightshade berries for 
use in pies. Today we know the tomato berry is not toxic (though the rest 
of the plant is mildly toxic), and tomato sauces may be short cooked or 
even raw - unless you subscribe to Michio Kushi's Macrobiotics theories 
which hold them to be so toxic that I must have died decades ago from 
eating so many of them.</p>

<p>Tomatoes are plentiful now but flavor has been developed out of 
commercial varieties. While agricultural colleges and industrial farms 
concentrated on durability, mechanical picking and shelf life, without 
regard to flavor, the real culprit was appearance. In the '50s, a 
variety was found with a genetic trait that caused it to ripen evenly, 
rather than being green on top.</p>

<p>This even ripening trait was bred into almost all commercial tomato 
varieties. It has recently been found that this trait also suppresses 
sweetness and other flavoring traits. The only way to get really tasty 
tomatoes is to grow heirloom varieties yourself, or buy them from small 
growers at farmer's markets. Tomato developers are attempting to get 
the flavor back in without sacrificing even ripening, but say it's a 
very difficult task.</p>

<p>In Florida, powerful (read: "big political contributors") tomato 
growers have conspired to prevent competition from more flavorful 
Mexican tomatoes. Their politician pals have been happy to help with 
legislation (like packaging laws that guarantee ripe tomatoes will be 
crushed). To quote the head of a big Florida grower, "Who cares about 
flavor in tomatoes, they're always served with something else" (Wall 
Street Journal article back in the early '80s).</p>

<p>In the United States, California and Florida dominate the fresh tomato 
market, split about even. In addition, California produces about 90% of 
all tomatoes used for canning and processing, while Florida grows almost 
none for that purpose. Mexico is the main competitor to both states, but 
other states produce modest amounts, mostly for processing.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="var">Varieties - Wild</h2>

<p>All domesticated tomatoes belong to a single species, 
<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, a member of the <i>Solanum</i> branch of 
the <i>Solanaceae</i> or Nightshade Family. Wild tomatoes belong to 
different species, but cross breeding is still possible.</p>

<h3>Current Tomato</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>]
<br><img src="img/ns_currtom01h.jpg" alt="Current Tomatoes on Plant" class=mrg>
<p>This wild tomato is considered to be the ancestor of the 
domesticated tomato. It is native to Ecuador and Peru, but has been 
introduced elsewhere. It's berries are edible and it is often grown as 
an heirloom tomato, though still considered wild. It crosses freely 
with domesticated tomatoes, and is very important to breeding tomato 
cultivars, espeically for disease resistance, as the gene pool of the 
domesticated tomato is rather shallow.

<h3>Galapagos Tomato</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Solanum cheesmaniae</i>]
<br><img src="img/ns_galatom01h.jpg" alt="Galapagos Tomatoes on Plant" class=mrg>
<p>This wild tomato is native to the Galapagos Islands, where it 
developed in isolation. Both its foliage and fruit are a paler color than 
its nearest relative, the Current Tomato, but the fruit still tastes like 
tomatoes, and is edible.

<h2>Varieties - Domesticated</h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id="colors">Colors of Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_colormix01h.jpg" alt="Tomatoes in Three Colors" class=mrg> 
Many sizes and varieties of tomato are available in red, orange, yellow, 
sometimes purple, and of course green (both ripe and unripe). While other 
writers say color doesn't matter, I have compared the same size from the 
same farms and found yellow tomatoes sadly deficient in tomato flavor. 
Orange is better, but red is best. Use other colors for accent where 
flavor isn't critical.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="beef">Beefsteak</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_beef03e.jpg" alt="Beefsteak Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
These large red tomatoes are often well over 1 pound each - the one in 
the picture was over a pound, over 4 inches in diameter, and displays 
the "navel" typical of these large tomatoes. Developed for the sandwich 
industry, beefsteaks makes large and often largely tasteless slices 
that hold together well. Small growers, however, can get excellent 
flavor with some beefsteak varieties. While excellent for sandwiches, 
they are less suitable for salads and general eating because they 
are not very juicy.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Campari Tomato</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_campar02e.jpg" alt="Campari Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
These small red tomatoes are usually about 1-5/8 inches in diameter,  
weigh about 1-1/8 ounces (34 gms), and may have two or three chambers. 
Camparis are very popular here in Southern California, often sold as 
clusters, but also loose. They are generally very juicy and sweet, with 
good tomato flavor. Buy them quite firm - though they will be a little 
softer than grape tomatoes should be. If at all mushy, their flavor and 
texture will be inferior. They are always unwaxed if sold as clusters, 
and may be unwaxed sold loose, so they should be eaten within a day or 
two.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Cherry Tomato</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_cherry07e.jpg" alt="Cherry Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
These small red tomatoes range from about 1 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter. 
Those in the photo ranged up to 1.2 inches and weighed about 2.3 to the 
ounce (8 to 100gms). They are shown with a 6-1/4 ounce medium regular 
tomato. Like Grape Tomatoes, they should be quite firm - if at all soft 
their flavor and texture will be inferior.<p></p>

<p>For a while these were hailed as the savior of flavor in commercial 
tomatoes, but the tomato industry quickly learned how to make flavorless 
cherry tomatoes. They are still usually more flavorful than Mass Market 
Tomatoes, but the Grape Tomato has overtaken them in the markets. They 
are usually a two chamber fruit (as shown in photo), but sometimes three 
chambers. For salads, I usually cut them once crosswise if small, and 
the halves once lengthwise if large.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="cluster">Cluster Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_cluster13e.jpg" alt="Large and Small Cluster Tomatoes" class=mrg>
I see these in four sizes, large, campari, cherry and grape. The campari 
and smaller sizes are generally quite good, but the larger ones (2-1/2 
inches and larger) are almost always sadly disappointing, like other 
medium and large hothouse tomatoes.
<p>The claim is that cluster tomatoes, left on the stem, will continue to 
draw nourishment and will ripen better, but this amounts to yet another 
hoax put over on the wannabe gourmets. Nothing can fix a hothouse 
tomato. Stick to the small ones, or even good quality field grown 
Mass Market tomatoes left out on the counter to ripen for about 4 days. 
Clusters are not waxed, so they dehydrate quickly and you should plan 
on using them up within 2 or 3 days.
<br class=cll></p>



<h3>Fresno Tomatoes</h3> 
<br><img src="img/to_fresno02e.jpg" alt="Large Fresno Tomatoes" class=mrg>
These are an example of what commercial tomatoes could be. They show 
up in some of the produce markets I shop at around September, but I 
suspect most go to the fancy restaurant trade. They are picked quite 
ripe, are large, thin skinned, juicy, sliceable and have excellent 
tomato flavor.
<p>Of course, ripe, juicy and thin skinned means they cannot survive the 
rough handling most commercial tomatoes suffer, and they may have various 
cosmetic inperfections. The one to the left in the photo was 3-7/8 inches 
diameter, 3 inches high and weighed 13-7/8 ounces. They were purchased 
from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2016 US 
$0.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="grape">Grape Tomatoes</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Teardrop Tomatoes]
<br><img src="img/to_grape14e.jpg" alt="Medium Tomato with Grape Tomatoes" class=mrg>
<p>
These tomatoes have become much more common than Cherry Tomatoes here 
in Southern California. Buy them from a bin if you can, so you can 
check firmness. If they are at all soft, they will be inferior in 
flavor and texture. Most sold are red, but yellow and orange 
varieties are also available.
Some varieties are exceptionally sweet and tasty, others are purely 
decorative, having almost no flavor. In general, yellow ones have the 
least flavor and red ones have the most, with orange ones in between.</p>
<p>These tomatoes are usually "two chambered" (see example to the left 
in photo). I usually cut them in half crosswise for use in salads. They 
are usually up to 1-1/4 inch long, 7/8 inch diameter and weigh about 6 
to the ounce (20/100 grams). The medium regular tomato in the photo 
weighed 6-1/4 ounces.
<br class=cll><p>

<h3 id="green">Green Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_green03e.jpg" alt="Green Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
These are unripe regular tomatoes (as distinct from 
<a href="ns_tomatilz.html">Tomatillos</a>, aka Mexican Green Tomatoes, 
which aren't really tomatoes).  They are much less sweet than ripe 
tomatoes, but are are called for by some recipes. They are nearly 
impossible to find in chain supermarkets, so you'll have to grow them or 
get them from a local grower or farmer's market. The photo specimens 
were purchased from a market in Los Angeles (La Crescenta) that serves 
an Armenian community, for 2016 US $0.99 / pound. The largest weighed 
5-1/2 ounces. The white blush to the right indicates this tomato was 
on the verge of ripening, as was the cut specimen.
<p>Green tomatoes were thought to contain significant amounts of 
solanine neurotoxins, but this is not well supported in medical 
literature. They do contain the much less dangerous alkaloid tomatine, 
but there are no reports of persons harmed.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Green Zebra Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_gzebra04e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Green Zebra Tomatoes" class=mrg>
These are an example of some of the exotics being grown these days. 
These were of good, moderately tart flavor eaten as shown, but became 
a bit bland when riper. They were about 1-5/8 inches diameter and 
weighed just under one ounce each.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="heirloom">"Heirloom" Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_hrloom16d.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Heirloom Tomatoes" class=mrg>
Many in this class are tomatoes that actually taste good. They come in 
various sizes and colors, are often irregular in shape and may have 
healed or partially healed cracks. They usually have odd names - the 
cut one in the photo is the popular <i>Purple Cherokee</i>, as is the 
one to the right. Heirlooms tend to be thin skinned and delicate, 
unsuited to high speed commerce, so you have to grow them yourself 
or buy them from a local grower or farmer's market. The organically 
grown photo specimens were purchased from a farmers market in Los 
Angeles (Montrose) for 2016 US $4.00 / pound.
<p>Most "heirloom" tomatoes are not actually older varieties, but 
recently developed varieties that imitate them - and may or may not 
have been developed from older varieties. The main requirements are 
better flavor, odd colors, weird shapes and maybe a few healed 
cracks.</p>
<p>According to the Los Angeles Times (07-2004), supermarket growers had 
noticed a market for "heirloom" tomatoes, and by 2006 some supermarkets 
were selling Copia and Costoluto Genovese for 2006 US $7.00 / pound. 
These are very striking in appearance, but are more suitable for tomato 
sauces and tomato paste than for salads and general eating.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="heircher">Heirloom Cherry Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_cherheir02h.jpg" alt="Black and Green Tomatoes" class=mrg>
These curious tomatoes remind me of my Black Cobra chilis (chilis 
are related to tomatoes), which are black on the sun side when green and 
ripen to bright orange. These tomatoes, in size up to 1-1/2 inches 
diameter, are green with very dark purple, almost black and ripen to a 
purplish red. Unfortunately, while my chilis are wonderful in both flavor 
and heat, these tomatoes were quite disappointing - evidence that all 
"heirloom" tomatoes aren't better than regular. Ripe, they were mushy 
and bland - actually better eaten green.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Hothouse Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_hothouse03e.jpg" alt="Hothouse Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
Perfectly round, red and beautiful, they have almost every trace of 
flavor carefully removed so nothing will distract you from admiring 
their perfect appearance. The cut photo specimen had less ripe tomato 
flavor than the cut Mass Market Tomato shown below. The Market Tomato was 
ripened three days on the counter.
<p>Supermarket chains post absurd prices for these, but their flavor 
will not improve much even set out on the counter for a few days. That 
is not to say they don't have uses - let them sit until they're really 
soft and use them to pelt politicians. The photo specimens were 
purchased from a big multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) 
which always has them, probably the ones that weren't perfect enough 
for Gelson's, and sells them for 2016 US $0.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="indust">Mass Market Tomatoes</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Supermarket Tomatoes]
<br><img src="img/to_indust04e.jpg" alt="Regular Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
<p>
Standard supermarket tomato varieties like "Red Rock" were developed 
by agricultural researchers to withstand machine picking, rough handling, 
long transportation, and still look pretty. They paid no attention to 
flavor, admitting they thought that would take care of itself. They've 
recently discovered that the genetic trait that causes even ripening, 
now incorporated in most market varieties, is also a trait that robs 
tomatoes of sweetness and flavor.</p> 

<p>Due to consumer complaints, there is now (2012) significant 
development effort devoted to flavor, but the problem is complex 
and commercial results are expected to come slowly. I've seen some 
improvement here in California, and I see more varieties that don't 
ripen evenly, but they are still often picked too green and remain 
whitish inside. The situation may be much worse in Florida, where the 
president of a huge tomato grower made this statement to the Wall 
Street Journal, "Who cares if a tomato has any flavor, it's always 
served with something else".</p>

<p>Select good quality Market Tomatoes that are firm and without bruises 
or soft spots. If possible, sample them before buying many, different 
batches from the same market are often quite different. I've found that 
certain markets more often have good tasting ones than other markets - 
it depends on their sources.  I buy them from a high volume produce 
store and select various stages of ripening for a steady supply.</p>

<p>Market Tomatoes should be quite juicy with big seed cavities full of 
liquid rather than solid with small or dry cavities. You're better off 
with a touch of green at the stem end than over-ripe, and avoid those 
with a uniform pale pink color. Set them out on a non-porous shelf or 
counter out of direct sunlight for a few days and you'll have tomatoes 
much better than expensive Hothouse Tomatoes.</p>

<p>Mass Market Tomatoes are always thinly coated with an edible wax to 
give them better shelf life, and I've had some last over a month sitting 
on the counter, until all the seeds inside were sprouted and trying to 
burst through the skin. Tomato sprouts contain a small amount of toxin 
to which some people are sensitive. I've sampled tomatoes with sprouted 
seeds without ill effect, but the flavor will have both changed and 
declined.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Mexican Green Tomato</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Tomatillo]
<br><a href="ns_tomatilz.html">
<img src="img/ns_tomatillo08m.jpg" alt="Tomatillo" class=mrg></a>
<p>

<h3 id="roma">Roma</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Italian Plum Tomatoes]
<br><img src="img/to_roma09e.jpg" alt="Cut and Whole Roma Tomatoes" class=mrg>
<p>
Romas are small elongated tomatoes, which may be pear shaped or heart 
shaped, typically 2-3/4 inches long and 1-1/4 inch diameter, weighing 
about 3 ounces. Generally they are red, but occasionally yellow or orange 
are available, but these have less intense tomato flavor. Roma tomatoes 
are often canned with a bit of Basil. They are preferred for Italian 
sauces and much other cooking because they have a high percentage of 
solids and little juice - which means they aren't that good for eating 
raw or for salads, but they still may be better than poorly ripened 
regular tomatoes.</p>
<p>California grown Romas (most sold in North America) have thick skins 
ane are quite sturdy ripe. This makes them durable for shipping, but they 
may be less tasty than those called for in European and African recipes. 
For such recipes, I usually ignore the demand for "Italian Plum Tomatoes" 
and use an equal weight of the best regular tomatoes.</p>
<p>To peel, give them a little longer in boiling water (1-1/2 minutes 
total) than for most tomatoes. California Romas for the canning industry 
are different, with thiner skins, and are picked fully ripe. This can 
give canned tomatoes much better flavor for sauces and similar recipes. 
California Central Valley canned Romas have proven consistently 
superior to those imported from Italy.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="rheart">Roso Bruno Tomato</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Brown Tomato, 
  Kumato (original name)]
<br><img src="img/to_rbruno08e.jpg" alt="Brown Tomatoes, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a patented variety grown by Dulcinea Farms in California. The 
San Jos&eacute; Mercury News called them a "New Taste Sensation" and 
worth ever bit of the US 2006 $3.99 / pound they were selling for up 
there in Yuppyville. My local produce market in Los Angeles (Sunland) 
was selling them then for between $.69 and $.89/pound. Of course showing 
off to your friends that you paid just $3.99/pound for hyped tomatoes 
may be an important consideration in San Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p>So how do they taste? Pretty decent for hothouse tomatoes, but there's 
only so good hothouse tomatoes get. Leave good quality field grown Mass 
Market Tomatoes on the counter to ripen for a few days and you can beat 
the flavor. They have to be grown in hothouses because of the patent 
nonsense. By now (2016) they seem to have disappeared from the general 
market here in Southern California - I haven't seen one for years - 
color it pass&eacute;.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>San Marzano Mini Plum Tomatoes</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_smarz02e.jpg" alt="Mini Plum Tomatoes with Medium Tomato" class=mrg>
<p>
Grown specially for the Yuppie market, these have little to recommend 
them except the prestigious Italian name and unusual shape. They are 
drier, fleshier and less flavorful than regular California Grape or 
Cherry Tomatoes. They are up to 1-7/8 inches long and 7/8 inch diameter 
at the widest part, weighing a little over 2.2 to the ounce. The photo 
specimens were hothouse grown in Canada and distributed by Trader Joe's 
at 2016 US $4.46 / pound. The photo also includes a regular medium 
tomato weighing 6-1/4 ounces, sold for $0.99 / pound, which tasted a 
lot better.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Siberian Tomato</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_siberia01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Siberian Tomatoes" class=mrg>
Seeds of this variety are reported to have been developed in Russia, 
and introduced to Canada in 1975, spreading from there. These tomatoes 
are not grown commercially, but seeds are widely available for home 
gardeners. They are valued for being a very early variety which can set 
fruit at as low as 38&deg;F/3.3&deg;C, and having a 50 day seedling to 
fruit time. They are not, however, much more frost tolerant than other 
tomato plants. They are a very early tomato in frost free parts of 
California. They are small, up to about 5 ounces and 2-1/2 inches 
diameter.

<h3>Strawberry Tomato</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_straw02d.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Strawberry Tomatoes" class=mrg>
These tomatoes, most often sold "on the vine" at high prices, are larger 
than Cherry Tomatoes. Flavor is good, and they measure about 1.5 inches 
long and 1.3 inches diameter, weighing about 0.86 ounce each. The photo 
spcimens, grown in California, were purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $3.54 / pound.

<h3 id="vineripe">"Vine Ripened"</h3>
<br><img src="img/to_vripe02e.jpg" alt="Greenish Tomatos, Whole and Cut" class=mrg>
"Vine Ripened" is an industry term describing tomatoes that were not 
dead green but rather had at least some pink blush when picked. The 
photo examples can be considered "best case", they are often greener. 
The tomatoes are then "ripened" in transportation by exposure to 
ethylene gas. In years past packers would just toss gasoline soaked rags 
into the truck to ripen the load, but in our current "over-regulated" 
business environment they have to use pure ethylene gas.

<h2><u>Canned Tomatoes:</u></h2> &nbsp;
<br><img src="img/to_canned01h.jpg" alt="Can of Whole Tomatoes" class=mrg>
In some parts of North America, canned tomatoes are the only way you 
can get enough tomato flavor to make a decent tomato sauce. Even in 
better regions, or for home growers, it's needed in the off season.
Canners can pick tomatoes when they are truly ripe, since they will 
be processed immediately - and they need to pick them fully ripe, 
because they compete only on flavor and price. One can looks pretty 
much like any other can. I have found some of the "no-name" brands 
can be as good as or better than the "big name" brands. Canned tomato 
products are usually in 14-1/2 ounce, 28 ounce and 5.5 pound cans.

<p>These products contain only tomatoes, salt and occasionally a basil 
leaf or two. For making sauces, the farther down the list from Whole 
Canned Tomatoes you go, the more sauce a can will make, but the flavor 
will be increasingly darker and it will splatter more during cooking.</p>
<br class=cll><p>  
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Tomato Juice:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, this is tomatoes crushed 
    and strained, then heated for the minimum time necessary for canning. 
    <u>UNFORTUNATELY</u> most canned "tomato juice" sold today is 
    reconstituted from tomato concentrate and is highly inferior to 
    what we could buy back in the '70s and before. <i>Sacramento</i> 
    brand, for instance, was top rated, but the brand was sold to a 
    tomato growers cooperative that switched to concentrate. This ruined 
    the product, which soon disappeared from the market.
    <p></p></li>
    <li><h3>Whole Canned Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Whole Roma or other small 
    ripe tomatoes, often with basil, are great for making the tastiest 
    light tomato sauces and soups, but much of what's in the can is 
    tomato juice. <u>Never discard the juice</u> as much of the flavor 
    resides there. Use it along with the tomatoes, just let it simmer 
    down a bit.<p></p></li>
    <li><h3>Italian Canned Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Just about every writer 
    of Italian recipes say you <u>must</u> use only imported Italian 
    tomatoes. This is just blind prejudice. In every properly conducted 
    blind tasting, California Central Valley canned tomatoes have proven 
    superior, with Trader Joe's often at the top. Originally, this was 
    blamed on Calcium Chloride, used as a firming agent in American 
    canned tomatoes, but now the Italians use it too - and still end up 
    with the bottom scores. My personal experience confirms the test 
    results.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Diced Tomatoes:</h3> These are packed in juice just like whole 
    tomatoes but will yield a little more sauce because the dice pack 
    more densely.
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Kitchen Cut:</h3> &nbsp; These are like diced, but packed in 
    pur&eacute;e like Crushed Tomatoes.
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Crushed Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These have a higher sauce yield 
    than diced but a heavier more "cooked" flavor, because they're 
    packed in pur&eacute;e rather than juice. The pur&eacute;e has been 
    "cooked down" to make it more dense, but it still makes a pretty 
    good sauce.
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Tomato Pur&eacute;e:</h3> &nbsp; This is similar to crushed 
    tomatoes but completely smooth. Definitely preferable to Tomato Paste 
    for sauce recipes that demand a concentrated tomato flavor. Brand 
    matters here so select one that is light and flavorful. The harder 
    to find 14oz cans are quite convenient.
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Tomato Paste:</h3> &nbsp; For this, tomatoes have been cooked 
    down until the tomato flavor is highly concentrated, but it also 
    has a rather "cooked" flavor, sometimes even a burned flavor, so 
    select a brand that has decent flavor. Paste is available in cans 
    as small as 6 oz, and sometimes in squeeze tubes. The tube may be 
    worthwhile if you don't use much (most recipes call for very small 
    amounts).
    <p>There's likely to be plenty left over from even a 6 oz can. If 
    you'll be using it again reasonably soon, scoop the rest into a very 
    small jar, put a layer of olive oil over it to suppress mold and 
    store it in the refrigerator. For less frequent use, freeze it in 
    the can, then remove the bottom of the can, warm the can some, push 
    the slug of tomato paste out, and wrap it in plastic. Put back in 
    the freezer. Later you can shave off just as much as you need.</p>
    <p>Note that the original process in Italy was for the lady of the 
    house to peel tomatoes, pound them well, and hand spread the pulp 
    on wooden boards. These would be set out in the sun all day and 
    brought in at night until sufficiently concentrated. This probably 
    produced a better, less "cooked" tasting product, if you don't 
    mind the flies.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><u>Stewed Tomatoes:</u></h2> &nbsp; These 
are sliced tomatoes (half way between whole and diced) with flavoring 
ingredients similar to those in a simple Tomato Sauce, but often way 
too much of it. They are packed in tomato juice. You're a lot better 
off starting with whole canned tomatoes, cutting them into chunks and 
adding your own seasonings.<p></p>

<h2><u>Tomato Sauce</u></h2>
<br><img src="img/to_sauces01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Simple Tomato Sauce" class=mrg>
This product comes in many varieties. The simplest canned sauces 
generally contain tomato pur&eacute;e, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, 
citric acid, dehydrated bell pepper, and some spices, but have very 
simple tomatoey flavors. You should always have a simple sauce like this 
on hand, in small 8 ounce cans. It's a very handy recipe ingredient. My 
usual brand is Faron "Spanish Style" (in in the photo). If I don't use 
a whole can I freeze it the same as for tomato paste (see above). 
Actually, I often use it in place of tomato paste, using three or four 
times as much.
<p>There are many much more complex "Gourmet" sauces on the market, but 
I never use them. It's just way too easy to make better sauces starting 
with canned tomatoes. Many claim to be "Italian", but are really 
"Italian American", a cuisine despised by real Italians. Some of the 
commercial sauces have an angry flavor, and most will splatter badly 
when heated. "Gourmet" tomato sauces can contain just about anything, 
so long as tomatoes are a major ingredient. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2><u>Sun Dried Tomatoes</u></h2> 
<br><img src="img/to_sundry01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Sundried Tomatoes" class=mrg> 
Long a specialty of Italy, sun dried tomatoes were made for use during 
the off-season, and are now called for in many Mediterranean recipes. 
Originally, tomatoes were sliced and set out in the sun on slanted 
boards. The boards were brought in at night and put out the next morning 
until the tomatoes reached the right state of dryness. Then they would be 
packed in olive oil.
<p>Today, more efficient methods are used but the basics are still the 
same - and some are now available without the olive oil. The photo 
specimen is from Trader Joe's - no country of origin, so it's pretty 
certain it wasn't Italy. Due to similarity with some other products, I 
suspect it was from Fresno. Ingred: Sun Dried Roma Tomatoes, Pure Olive 
Oil, Garlic, Herbs, Spices, Sulphur Dioxide (for color retention). In 
my opinion, the Garlic, Herbs and Spices pretty much overwhelm the 
tomato flavor in this product.</p>

<h2><u>Dried Tomatoes</u></h2> 
<br><img src="img/to_dehyd02h.jpg" alt="Sliced Dehydrated Tomatoes" class=mrg> 
The photo specimens were sliced Roma tomatoes dried in a home type 
electric dehydrator at 114&deg;F/46&deg;C. They dried quite quickly, 
with 14 ounces of raw tomatoes, end slices discarded, becoming 5/8 
ounces dried (4.5%). With a slightly leathery "snack chip" texture, they 
had good concentrated tomato flavor and bright red color.

<h2><u>Tomato Ketchup</u></h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Catsup; Kekap (Malay); 
  Ket&ccedil;ap (Turk)]
<br>
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_ketchz.html">
<img src="img/sa_kechup01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Ketchup" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Ketchup is held in high favor by children, because it has more sugar 
than ice cream - it's sort of tomato flavored candy. By federal law, 
if your product doesn't have that much sugar it can't be called 
"ketchup". This was a ploy by the food industry to "standardize" the 
product so they didn't have to reveal on the label that it was about 
1/3 sugar (other ingredients are water, salt, vinegar, spices, and, yes, 
tomatoes). For details see our

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Followers of Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic movement condemn tomatoes 
as dangerously toxic and highly destructive to the human organism (along 
with potatoes, eggplants, chilis and tropical fruit). Since I eat 
vast amounts of fresh tomatoes, (raw, with Sukang Iloco vinegar and a 
little salt), tomato sauces, and recipes with plenty of tomatoes in them, 
I should at least be on my deathbed by now.</p>

<p>Of course, you don't want to eat a lot of green tomatoes that aren't 
well cooked, or any of the foliage, as these contain toxins to which 
some people are quite sensitive.</p>

<p>Tomatoes contain the important antioxidant Licopene, and are by far 
the richest source of Licopene in the American diet (Gac fruit has a lot 
more, but try finding that at your local market). This antioxidant has 
been shown to contribute to resistance to some cancers (including 
prostate cancer), heart disease, osteoporosis and decline in cognitive 
function with age. Cooking tomatoes increases the amount and 
bio-availability of licopene.</p>

<p>Tomatoes also contain plenty of vitamin C and A, and are quite 
high in potassium - more than bananas. Potassium helps lower blood 
pressure and counters the ill effects of excessive sodium.</p>

<p>Green tomatoes, seed sprouts and foliage were said to contain 
significant amounts of the neurotoxin solanine, but this is not well 
supported by medical literature. I've eaten modest amounts of green 
tomatoes raw without any ill effects.</p>
