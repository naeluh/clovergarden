Native to somewhere around Turkey and Eastern Europe wolfberries are now 
grown worldwide and particularly in China, the main commercial supplier. 
The berry tastes similar to dried cranberries but is more tart and tastes 
somewhat of tomato, not surprising since tomatoes are also nightshades.
</p>
<p>"Tibetan / Himalayan Goji" products are promoted by "health food" 
outlets - even though Goji isn't harvested in that region, and any 
"organic" claims are unlikely to be true - but when has the health food 
industry ever checked in with reality? Berries from the same Chinese 
sources can be purchased at a much lower price at Asian markets.</p>

<p>In Chinese traditional medicine wolfberry is said to enhance the 
immune system and improve eyesight, sperm production, liver function and 
circulation. Medical studies in China indicate it helps prevent macular 
degeneration and glaucoma as well as being strong in anticancer 
antioxidants, but confirming studies have not been done in the West.

In the West, wolfberries are generally eaten as a snack straight from 
the bag, or as a component of various "health food" concoctions. In China 
they are almost always cooked, often in tonic soups and teas 
or as a flavoring in congee. In China they are also used as a flavoring 
in some wines, and in the U.S. a Colorado micro-brewery uses them to 
flavor beer.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  Well stocked Asian markets have them dried in 
plastic bags, usually labeled "Fructus Lycii". Look for them in the same 
area as medicinal herbs and barks. I avoid those dyed bright red - who 
knows what they use for dye in China. They can also be purchased in some 
health food stores but at a much higher price.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; dried cranberries or sun dried tomatoes or a mix 
of the two.<p></p>
