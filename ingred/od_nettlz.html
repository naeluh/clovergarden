<h1>Stinging Nettles</h1>
<br><img src="img/od_nettle01g.jpg" alt="Leafy Stinging Nettles Fronds" class=mrg>
[Shishnu (Nepal); <i>Urtica dioica</i> subsp. <i>gracilis</i> (American) 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Urtica dioica</i> subsp. <i>dioica</i> (European) of 
family <i>Urticaceae</i> of order <i>Rosales</i>]
<p>
The Stinging Nettle is the most common culinary member of the 
<i>Urticaceae</i> family, though others are also eaten locally. This 
highly nutritious plant was important to the Native population of North 
America, but it has fallen out of use here except as an ingredient in 
some herbal teas and hair treatment formulas.</p> 

<p>Nettles are still eaten frequently in Ireland, where they were one 
   of the major reasons the English were not able to starve <u>all</u> 
   the Irish to death during the potato famine. They contain more usable 
   protein than just about any other leafy green, in general by a wide 
   margin. Nettles are also eaten in parts of Northern and Eastern 
   Europe, as well as in Italy - and in Nepal and the neighboring Kumaon 
   division of India. They also have medicinal uses, particularly in 
   treatment of arthritis.</p>

The European stinging nettle has longer narrower leaves (photo left), but 
is used in the same ways as the American variety (photo top).

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California this herb is rather 
scarce, but can sometimes be procured from herb growers at local Farmer's 
Markets. In more humid regions where there are streams you may be able to 
harvest your own. Use shears to cut tender young shoots before they have 
flowered. When flowering they develop gritty cystoliths which can irritate 
the urinary tract when consumed.
<p>Do wear gloves when gathering nettles, as the "stinging" part of the 
name is not there without reason. Incidentally, you are more likely to be 
stung by lightly brushing against the plant than by handling it firmly.</p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely bagged, nettles can be kept in the 
refrigerator for nearly a week if fresh and not wilted.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Float wash nettles as you would spinach, they are 
similarly muddy. Remove the harder stems - those turning dark or reddish. 
Handle them with rubber gloves if your skin is tender.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Nettles are most often used in soups. They 
should be added at the very end of cooking and cooked for only a few 
minutes to preserve their bright green color. Nettles are also eaten raw, 
but only in Dorset, England, at the annual Stinging Nettle Eating 
Championship. They are also used to make an aromatic syrup dating from 
Roman times which is used to flavor drinks, and as a flavoring in some 
cheeses and beers.<p></p>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2> &nbsp; Nettles are very 
high in protein compared to other leafy plants (25% or more by dried 
weight). They are also rich in vitamins A, C, D, K and minerals iron, 
potassium, manganese and calcium.

<p>Nutritious nettles were probably significant in the English failing to 
starve <u>all</u> the Irish to death. Yes, it was a deliberate policy. 
During the famine there was enough food in Ireland, but most of it was 
under armed guard for export to England. The English did their best to 
prevent other countries from supplying the Irish with food, or with 
money to buy food.</p>

<p>Nettles have been used medicinally for thousands of years for many 
ailments, including prostate swelling, arthritis, anemia, hay fever, 
kidney stones, urinary infections, gout, pain and others problems. It's 
effectiveness has been confirmed by medical testing in some cases.</p>
 
<p>While some large nettles in Australia (everything is more toxic in 
Australia) have stung animals and at least one human to death, our 
culinary nettles are not dangerous. If they sting you the sting goes 
away in 10 minutes or so.</p>
