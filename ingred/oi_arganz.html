[<i>Argania spinosa</i>]
<p>
The argan tree, once fairly widespread in North Africa, is now pretty much 
restricted to parts of Morocco. The tree is a remanent population surviving 
from the Tertiary geologic era and is now considered endangered due to 
overgrazing by goats, charcoal manufacturing and encroachment of agriculture. 
UNESCO has designated the forests as a Biosphere Reserve, but the best bet 
on its survival is commercial value.

Due to conservation efforts, the oil is now being exported to Europe 
and North America, at prices ranging up to 2011 US $80 per half liter. 
In parts of Morocco the oil is used as a substitute for Olive Oil, for 
dipping and cooking, so it can be important in accurately reproducing 
Berber cuisine. It is also, due to its unique nutty flavor (and high 
price), being adopted by high end chefs in Europe and North America for 
some of their more expensive preparations.  It has also long been used 
as a cosmetic oil due to it's high content of Vitamin E and phenols, 
useful for rejuvenating skin.</p>

<p>The seed kernels are removed from the fruit shell and lightly roasted, 
giving the oil a nutty flavor. They are then ground and the oil is 
extracted by pressure, once by hand, now by mechanical presses. The left 
over meal is used as animal feed.</p>

<p>A very drought resistant tree, the Argan is fed upon mainly by goats, 
which are agile enough to climb onto even high branches. Traditionally, 
the oily seeds were recovered by washing them out of goat droppings. 
Today this method is still widely used, but for commercial product the 
goats are restricted and the fruit mechanically harvested. The oil is 
manufactured by a number of Moroccan Women's Cooperatives.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; In North America, this product is available mainly 
by on-line purchasing, though it may be carried by some high end gourmet 
shops. In a tightly sealed bottle, away from light and heat, it should be 
good for a little over a year.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Argan oil is used pretty much the same way Olive 
Oil is, for dipping, dressings and cooking. It is said to be even more 
oxidation resistant than Olive Oil and has a smoke point comparable to 
Pure Olive Oil.
