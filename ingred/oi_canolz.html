<h1>Canola Oil</h1>
<br><img src="img/oi_canola07h.jpg" alt="Canola Flowers" class=mrg>
[Lear Oil, <i>Brassica napa</i>]

<p><u>Ignore all recipe calls for Canola Oil</u>. The Canola industry 
pays the publishers not to publish any recipe or cookbook that does not 
call for Canola Oil. There are three professions that are notoriously 
easy to buy, Politicians, Scientists, and Publishers. The Canola industry 
is paying <u>all of them</u> to make sure you see Canola Oil and only 
Canola Oil. </p>

<p>Here we have yet another example of how an industrial product with a 
declining market was repositioned as "health food", backed by intensive 
promotion and inconclusive testing.</p>

<p>Rapeseed oil was long an important lubricant for machinery exposed to 
water and steam, so during World War II, when European and Asian supplies 
were cut off, large plantings were established in Canada. After the war, 
new markets needed to be found. Unfortunately rapeseed oil was considered 
unfit for human consumption, so that needed to be fixed, along with the 
name, before it could be sold as food.</p>

<p>"Canola" is an invented name (Canada + oil + low acid) for genetically 
modified rapeseed oil.  Technically it is "low erucic acid, low 
glucosinolates rapeseed oil". Originally this modification was by breeding 
but recently it's by "engineering", with 80% of the crop now considered 
"GM". As with other GM crops, the power of money assures we cannot know 
if it is safe (<a href="oi_canolz.html#c02">C2</a>, <a href="oi_canolz.html#c03">C3</a>).</p>

<p>Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is a member of the mustard / cabbage 
family, and considered a Turnip, but is not used for food, either roots or 
greens. Those turnips are <i>Brassica rapa</i>. It is also not the same 
as Field Mustard, an oil seed mustard once called <i>Brassica 
campestris</i> but now considered a variety of <i>Brassica rapa</i>. The 
only vegetable involvement of <i>B. napus</i> is the Rutabaga, hybridized 
with a cabbage and officially <i>Brassica napobrassica</i>.</p>

<p>Umnodified rapeseed oil is high in erucic acid, thought to cause of 
heart lesions in humans and animals. The FDA considers it unfit for 
food. The genetically modified Canola version is allowed up to 2% erucic 
acid and is listed by the FDA as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe). 
Rumors that Canada paid the FDA $50 million to get that GRAS rating is 
unlikely to be true, but they probably paid a good something to someone.
</p>

<p>Canola is now intensively promoted by the seed oil industry as the 
healthiest of all cooking oils, pointing to it's high monounsaturated 
and Omega-3 fat contents. So successful has this overwhelming promotion 
been that most food writers and cookbooks now list Canola oil by name 
in every recipe calling for cooking oil (see first paragraph).</p>

<p>As usual with industry promotions, there's a lot of negative stuff 
swept under the carpet and locked in the closet. Some experts point to 
dangers and a few even call Canola unfit for human consumption - but those 
shrill Internet tracts about mustard gas are completely without merit. 
Mustard gas is not derived from plants.

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<p>The taste of Canola oil is unobtrusive so it can be used as a general 
purpose oil, like grapeseed oil or peanut oil. It's smoke point is 
400&deg;F/200&deg;C which places it at the low end of the 
"deep fry" range, but its oxidation index is 5.5. That's better than corn 
oil's 6.2 and Soy oil's 7.0 but not as good as Peanut Oil's 3.7, and way 
worse than Olive Oil's 1.5. This means that, to avoid rancidity and 
resulting carcinogens, Canola oil should be used only for rather brief 
frying jobs.</p>

<p>Canola oil for food processing and "fast food" has an oxidation index 
of 0.3, but it's  not available in your local market. Of course it's 
partially hydrogenated, so it's deadly trans fats, but commercial users 
can still call it "Canola Oil".</p>

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Canola oil is claimed to be one of the more "heart friendly" oils, 
having a very high percentage of monounsaturated fats (though not as much 
as Olive Oil) and a very low percentage of saturated fats. It also has a 
high percentage of Omega-3 fatty acids, but comparisons to the Omega-3 
in fish oil (a different form) are not valid. Plant Omeg-3 is very 
poorly converted to the fish oil type and is useless if not converted.</p>

<p>The high Omega-3 content may, in fact, be a problem. Omega-3 is a 
polyunsaturated fat, posing a rancidity problem, particularly at high 
temperatures. Canola oil is mechanically pressed at high temperatures and 
extracted from mashed seeds with hexane solvents which are driven off by 
more high temperatures. By time this treatment is complete much of the 
polyunsaturated fat content is degraded and the oil stinks of rancidity. 
It is then "deodorized", which converts the Omega-3 to - yes, you guessed 
it - trans fats. Canola oil is officially 0.2% trans fats but actual 
measurements of commercial oils have shown up to 4.0%.</p>

<p>Some researchers suspect the Omega-3 content may be the cause of 
heart problems seen in laboratory rodents, particularly because high 
Omega-3 flaxseed oil produces similar problem, but this is far from 
certain. Others have found monounsaturated fats taken alone are 
sufficiently damaging. Researchers have found, though, that "evil" 
saturated fats apparently protect rodent hearts from damage caused by 
Canola oil.</p>

<p>These experiments may explain why, in Asia, regular "high erucic acid" 
mustard oil has been used as cooking oil for centuries, yet heart lesion 
problems have been rare, appearing mainly in impoverished regions. 
Asian populations using mustard oil also used plenty of coconut oil, 
butter ghee, and lard, all very high in protective saturated fats. Now 
that the American Heart Association's vendetta against saturated fats 
has reached Asia, as if fades here, users of mustard oil are at risk. 
Olive oil, incidentally, has twice as much saturated fat as Canola, and 
1/3 the polyunsaturated fats. It has never been suspected of causing 
heart lesions.</p>

<p>Some tests show that Canola oil releases more toxins into the air in 
deep fry operations than olive oil, which may be the cause of discomfort 
and complaints from some food workers. More testing needs to be done on 
this - testing by organizations <u>not</u> on the Canola industry's 
payroll.</p>

<p>The "low glucosinolates" part of the Canola definition doesn't directly 
affect you - it just means the "cake" left after extracting the oil tastes 
better in cattle feed.</p>
