<h1>Coconut Oil</h1>

[<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]
<p>

Coconut oil is either the most deadly oil you can consume, or the most 
healthy cooking oil on earth - depending on which panel of "experts" 
you chose to believe. Demographics favor "healthy". It is the most used 
cooking oil in southeast India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines 
- not regions noted for high incidence of congestive heart disease.</p>

<p>Coconut oil is 91% saturated fats and only 3% polyunsaturated fats. 
It is highly resistant to rancidity, so can be stored at room 
temperature for long periods of time, and is a preferred ingredient for 
many products that will be stored at room temperature. Of course, 
with all that saturated fat it's pretty stiff, with a melting point of 
76&deg;F/24.4&deg;C. The specimen in the photo above was at 75.5&deg;F, 
so was very soft.</p>

<p>Coconut oil has an extremely low oxidation factor so it is highly 
durable as a frying oil, even more durable than beef tallow. Virgin oil 
has to be kept below 350&deg;F/175&deg;C,  but RBD (refined) oil can go 
as high as 450&deg;F/232&deg;C.</p>

<p>Northern Indians despise the coconut oil used in the south as 
"smelly" (it smells like coconuts), but the oil commonly available 
in North America is thoroughly deodorized, with almost no coconut odor. 
My tests (RBD oil) show it to be a fine medium high temperature frying 
oil, clear and devoid of any flavor that would interfere with the 
taste of the food being fried.</p>

<h3>Types of Coconut Oil:</h3> &nbsp;  Three types of coconut oil 
are marketed: "RBD" (Refined, Bleached and Deodorized), "Virgin", 
and Hydrogenated. The term "extra virgin" has no meaning in regard 
to coconut oil.
<ul>
<li><b>Hydrogenated</b> is unavailable in North America (due to trans fat 
labeling requirements), but is used by food processors in tropical 
countries to make products that will stay solid in the heat.</li>

<li><b>RBD</b> is the most common type in North America and the 
Philippines. Refinement is needed because the coconuts are sun dried in 
the open air and can accumulate contaminants. Deodorizing is done by 
heating, but you're going to heat it for cooking anyway, so I don't 
consider that a big problem. Bleaching is done by passing the oil 
through a bleaching filter medium.</li>

<li><b>Virgin</b> can be made through a wet separation method or by 
mechanical pressing. In both cases, fresh coconut that has not been 
dried is used, and the process is low temperature. The oil may or 
may not have gone through a deodorizing step of some kind.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage:</h3> &nbsp; RBD coconut oil is available 
in markets that serve practically any tropical community. It is also 
stocked by Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and other specialty chains. Virgin 
oil can be found in natural food stores or on the Internet. Coconut oil 
is extremely stable and can be stored in a tightly closed jar at room 
temperature for up to two years.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Virgin coconut oil needs to be kept below 
below 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. This places its smoke point quite a bit higher 
than butter, a bit higher than virgin olive oil and a bit lower than 
clarified butter. RBD oil can go as high as 450&deg;F/232&deg;C, about 
the same as corn oil and a little less than olive pomace oil.
<p></p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3>  &nbsp;  For applications where a liquid oil is 
appropriate, Pure Olive Oil (not virgin) is a good substitute. It has 
a good health profile and similarly neutral flavor. For applications 
requiring a solid fat, lard is the best substitute.
<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Depending on your preferred 
panel of experts, coconut oil is either more deadly than "heart killing" 
pig fat, or the most healthy cooking oil on earth. It is 91% saturated 
fat (pig fat is just 43% while butter is 65%). Saturated fats are 
supposed to clog your arteries with "bad" cholesterol.

<p>In the 1970s "Tropical Oils" (coconut and palm) were pretty much 
driven from the North American market by the American Heart Association's 
claims that it would clog your arteries, bringing on heart disease and an 
early death. They told us to use trans fats and polyunsaturated oils 
instead.</p>

<p>In recent times, just about everything the AHA has preached over 
the last 70 years has been shown to be wrong, in some cases dangerously 
wrong. Their campaigns have been based on incomplete and/or defective 
studies. Today, "tropical oils" are making a comeback, particularly in 
view of finding safe replacements for deadly trans fats and (possibly 
just as deadly) polyunsaturated oils.</p>

<p>Some say the discrepancy between medical theory and demographics is 
because there are "good" and "bad" saturated fats, just as we now have 
"good" and "bad" cholesterol. Others hold that the whole saturated 
fat theory is bunk. Pig fat doesn't seem very dangerous either, and 
the cholesterol theory is also unraveling fast. See our article 
<a href="oilshealth.html"><b>Oils, Fats &amp; Health</b></a> for 
more on this.</p>

<p>Today, many consider coconut oil the most healthy oil you can cook 
with, even healthier than olive oil. Further, the study always referenced 
to show how evil it is, an animal study, is invalid because it used 
hydrogenated coconut oil (contains evil 
<a href="oilshealth.html#trans"><b>Trans Fats</b></a>).</p>
