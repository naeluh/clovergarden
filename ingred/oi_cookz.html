<h1>Cooking Oils</h1>
<br><img src="img/oi_oils1.jpg" alt="Bottles and Cans of Cooking Oils" class=mrg>

<span class=bg>This is a quick summary for the practical cook. For more detailed 
information see our <a href="oils.html"><b>Oils

<p><span class=bg>Let me state clearly that I am not a licensed medical professional 
or nutritionist nor do I play one on TV or claim to be one on dates. The 
information presented here has been gathered from publicly available 
literature and is not to be, nor can be, considered medical advice. On 
the other hand, the medical establishment promoted trans fats for over 
70 years, fats now known to be more dangerous than any other. Medical 
opinion seems often based more on fad and corporate sponsorship than on 
valid science.</span>

<h2>Avoid for All Frying and Baking</h2>

<p>The fast food industry found these totally unusable because they 
started to become rancid immediately upon heating and were completely 
unusable within a few hours (beef tallow was so stable it lasted a 
month). Products of rancidity are suspected carcinogens. If these oils 
aren't good enough for Burger King why would you use them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; stability index 6.2</li>
<li>Safflower Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; stability 7.6</li>
<li>Soybean Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; stability 7.0</li>
<li>Sunflower Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; stability 6.8</li>
<li><a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a> &nbsp; - stability 5.5 - 
  highly controversial.
<li>"Vegetable Oil" &nbsp; - &nbsp; (whatever oil is cheapest at the 
  time)</li>
<li>Other oils high in polyunsaturated fats.</li>
</ul>

<h3>High Temperature Frying Oils</h3>

<p>All these oils will go to at least 450&deg;F/235&deg;C safely and are 
resistant to rancidity.  All oils safe at these temperatures are refined 
oils except Avocado which may be virgin.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Olive Pomace Oil</a> &nbsp;  
  - &nbsp; 460&deg;F/240&deg;C - affordable and excellent, with very low 
  polyunsaturated content. stability 1.5.</li>
<li>Avocado Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; 520&deg;F/270&deg;C - excellent but less 
   available, less economical and a little buttery in flavor.</li>
<li>Almond Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; 495&deg;F/255&deg;C - expensive.</li>
</ul>
Acceptable for shorter jobs, but more prone to oxidation (rancidity).
<ul>
<li>Peanut Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; 450&deg;F/235&deg;C - stability 3.7.</li>
<li>Rice Bran Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; 490&deg;F/255&deg;C - stability 4.2 
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Medium Temperature Frying Oils</h3>

<p>These oils will go safely to at least 400&deg;F/200&deg;C and again 
are all refined oils.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Pure Olive Oil</a> &nbsp; 
  - &nbsp; (not virgin) - oxidation 1.5.</li>
<li>Coconut Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; (refined) - oxidation 0.24</li>
<li>Palm Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; refined.</li>
<li><a href="oi_mustz.html">Mustard Oil</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  labeled "for massage only" due lack of FDA certification, but used for 
  cooking anyway.</li>
<li>Beef Tallow &nbsp; - &nbsp; oxidation 0.86.</li>
<li>Ghee &nbsp; - &nbsp;  highly clarified butter.</li>
<li>Any of the higher temperature oils.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moderate Temperature Frying Oils</h3>

<p>All these oils will go safely to at least 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Pure Olive Oil</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  (not virgin) - oxidation 1.5.</li>
<li>Coconut Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; (unrefined) - considered by some the most 
  healthy oil - oxidation 0.24.</li>
<li>Lard &nbsp; - &nbsp; pig fat - oxidation 1.7.</li>
<li>Goose, Duck and Chicken fat.</li>
<li>Any of the higher temperature oils.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Temperature Frying Oils</h3>

<p>These oils will all go safely to 300&deg;F/150&deg;C but may lose 
flavor before they reach that temperature, so 275&deg;F/135&deg;C is a 
good target maximum. Flavor is generally a major feature (and 
justification for higher price) with low temperature oils so you don't 
want to loose it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Virgin Olive Oil</a>.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
<li>Sesame Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (unrefined).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mayonnaise and Emulsified Sauces</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grapeseed Oil.</li>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Pure Olive Oil</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  (virgin may be too strongly flavored).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Salad Oils</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Virgin Olive Oil</a></li>
<li><a href="oi_olivez.html">Pure Olive Oil</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  not as strongly flavored as virgin.</li> 
<li>Grapeseed Oil</li> 
<li>Sesame Oil &nbsp; - &nbsp; (light and dark)
<li>Various "Natural", "Cold Pressed" and "Virgin" oils sold for their 
  unique flavors, including oils high in polyunsaturated fats (if 
  properly stored).</ul>

<h3>Reusing Oil</h3>

<p>Oils with a low oxidative stability index (1.5 and lower) can be 
reused several times provided they have not been overheated (to smoking 
or higher), they are filtered clean after use, and not too much time 
passes between uses. Oils with a higher oxidation index (polyunsaturated 
oils) should never be reused as they degrade rapidly.</p>
<p>After using a stable oil for deep frying I often reuse it a bit at a 
time for pan frying (if the flavor remains neutral). Oil used to fry fish 
should not be reused for any other purpose because it will become 
strongly flavored from dissolved fish oils, and these oils are not 
temperature stable.</p>
<p>To filter oil, line a wire strainer with a non-colored paper towel 
and pour the oil through it. Preferably it should still be fairly hot so 
it filters quickly.  In some cases the filter will clog and have to be 
replaced before all the oil is filtered.</p>

<h3>Sticking Problems</h3>

<p>Often problem foods that stick to the pan with most oils will not 
stick if fried in Lard. Yes, the American Heart Association has vilified 
lard and made you fear it, but in the 19th century America practically 
lived on pig fat and congestive heart disease was almost unknown. 
Populations using a lot of lard and people on the Atkins diet have not 
experienced an elevated incidence of heart disease. There seems to be 
something amiss with AHA "science".</p>

<h3>Cleanup Problems</h3>

<p>It is best to grease baking pans and the like with lard or beef tallow. 
Vegetable oils dry quickly to varnish and become very difficult to clean 
off. If oil is not baked on too hard, paint thinner may be useful for 
removing it - but be very cautious of the fire hazard.</p>
