<h1>Red Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</h1>
<br><img src="img/oi_dende02d.jpg" alt="Bowl of Oil" class=mrg>
[<i>Elaeis guineensis</i> (African), also 
  <i>Elaeis oleifera</i> (Americas) and <i>Attalea maripa</i> (Americas)]
<p>
Dend&ecirc; oil is much used in parts of West Africa, and in parts of 
Brazil influenced by Africa, particularly the Bahia region. It is 
considered essential for the proper color and flavor of dishes from those 
regions.</p>
<p>This oil is derived from the mesocarp, the red pulp surrounding the 
fruit of oil palms, not from the palm kernel. It is about 37% 
monounsaturated fats and 51% saturated fats (kernel oil is over 82% 
saturated fats), and it is high in vitamin E and antioxidants. The red 
color comes from alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, the same 
as from tomatoes. </p>
<p>Most Palm Oil production is now in Malaysia and Indonesia, from palms 
brought from Africa in colonial times.  The palm oil used for cooking 
in Southeast Asia is refined and of a pale yellow color. Most palm oil 
imported into North America is highly refined and deodorized for use 
in cosmetics and other processed products.  Virgin (red) oils are only 
produced in Africa and South America.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Even in Los Angeles this is not 
easy to find, except for a few African markets that have plenty 
in stock. It can be ordered on the Internet. The brand I've purchased 
is Tropical Traditions, which seems to be a trustworthy vendor of 
virgin cold pressed oil. Stored in the fridge it'll last a year or 
three.
<p></p>

<h3>Settling:</h3> &nbsp; A jar of Red Palm Oil will settle with 
intense red on top and orange lower down. The orange part has some water 
content.
<p></p>

<h3>Bleaching:</h3> &nbsp; Some African recipes call for "bleaching" 
the oil. This happens above the smoke point of 380&deg;F/195&deg;C.
The bleached oil is a much lighter slightly greenish yellow color, and 
the flavor is also simpler and less intense.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This oil does have a distinct flavor, and 
there seem to be two schools of thought here. Some recipes call for 
frying in Dend&ecirc; Oil, others for using a regular oil and stirring 
in about 2 Tablespoons of Dend&ecirc; Oil at the end of cooking. If you 
fry in it, keep the temperature to 350&deg;F/177&deg;C and lower. Smoke 
point is about 380&deg;F/195&deg;C for virgin oil, but flavor may be 
partially destroyed by that point.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst</h3>:  &nbsp; Some of my West African cookbooks say to use 
Peanut oil with ground Turmeric for an approximation of both color 
and taste. Personally, I'd use Coconut Oil to get closer, and a little 
less than 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric per Tablespoon of Oil seems to work 
well - not exact, but acceptable. Others say to color the oil with 
<a href="sp_annattz.html"><b>Annatto Seeds</b></a>, but this just 
gets you color, no approximation of flavor.
<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; The American Heart Association 
(AHA) pretty much drove palm and coconut oils (together called 
"tropical oils") out of use in North America with massive publicity 
campaigns claiming they would destroy your heart. They urged us to use 
trans fats instead. Guess how that worked out.
<p>It is true that tropical oils are high to very high in saturated 
fats, but the whole saturated fats theory is undergoing reevaluation 
and appears to have been based on defective research. In any case, 
tropical oils are making a comeback - some experts think they are the 
most healthful oils you can use. One thing is certain, they can't be 
worse than the trans fats long promoted by the AHA, and you survived 
those (we hope).</p>
<p>Dend&ecirc; Oil is high in alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, 
as well as tocopherols and tocotrienols (vitamin E), CoQ10, 
phytosterols, and glycolipids - all good stuff. Recent research shows it 
may provide significant protection to the hearts of rats fed a high 
cholesterol diet.</p>
