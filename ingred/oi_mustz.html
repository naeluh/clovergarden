<p>
Mustard Seed Oil is the traditional cooking oil of Bengal (Bangladesh 
and the northeast coast of India) and is used for some types of frying 
throughout northern India. It is also the primary cooking oil in parts 
of China and Russia. It is considered essential for reproducing the 
unique flavors of the regions where it is used, but in India, its use 
is declining because neutral flavored oils like sunflower are cheaper.
</p>
<p>Mustard seed oil contains significant amounts of erucic acid, a 
monounsaturated (Omega-9) oil, which was formerly considered dangerous. 
This has not been supported by recent research or by demographics (unless 
you are a male rat). Problems from human consumption do appear in times 
of famine when little other food is available. Apparently adequate 
amounts of saturated fats in the diet protect against problems from 
this oil, as well as from Canola oil (low erucic acid rapeseed oil).</p>
<p>There is currently a project in Belgium to breed a mustard plant 
that produces mustard oil that meets all requirements of international 
health authorities. This is important because Mustard plants grow well 
in environments unsuitable for oilseed rape. GRAS (Generally Regarded 
as Safe) approval should be quick, as this is being developed by 
natural breeding from a variety already well known for mustard seed 
oil.</p>

<p>Mustard Seed Oil is often confused with Rapeseed Oil and Canola Oil 
(low erucic acid rapeseed oil). Those oils are from a related species, 
(<i>Brassica napus</i>) but are not the same oil. Rapeseed was not 
used as a cooking oil until the development of Canola Oil. For details 
see our <a href="oi_canolz.html"><b>Canola Oil</b></a> page.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage</h3>: &nbsp; Mustard oil is easily found in 
markets serving an Indian or Pakistani community. You should purchase 
in a quantity you will use up in 6 months or so after opening.  Store it 
in a tightly sealed bottle away from light and heat and with as little 
air in the bottle as practical. It is a fairly stable oil but not as 
stable as pure olive oil.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Mustard oil is most often heated in the pan, 
with no other ingredients, until it reaches a temperature where the first 
wisps of smoke appear (about 480&deg;F/250&deg;C). Immediately take it 
off the heat and allow to cool to a more reasonable frying temperature 
(around 360&deg;F/180&deg;C) before adding other ingredients. This 
procedure removes the acrid taste of the raw oil and renders it quite 
pleasant.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst</h3>:  &nbsp;  Today, in India, mustard oil is gradually being 
replaced by cheaper but less stable neutral flavored oils like sunflower 
oil. I recommend, if you don't have mustard oil, you use pure olive oil 
(not virgin) or avocado oil, which are sufficiently neutral but more 
stable and with better health profiles than most oils. Do not bring 
these oils up to the smoke point. Some Indian cookbooks recommend 2 
Tablespoons of a regular cooking oil mixed with 1 teaspoon of Mustard 
Powder (such as Colman's). One cookbook I have recommends taking this 
mix up to the smoke point as for real mustard oil. I do not recommend 
this as it will surely burn the mustard powder.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition</h3>: &nbsp; Mustard oil sold in the U.S. 
and the European Union is always labeled "For massage use only". I 
suppose you could use it for that purpose, but there is some indication 
that small children could be harmed by such use. Pretty much all that is 
sold here in North America is used for cooking.

<p>The reason for this labeling is concern about the high erucic acid 
content, which was suspected of causing heart lesions. This is now 
strongly doubted by researchers, who have also noted that demographics 
do not support this danger. Research done on rats is invalid due 
to a specific difference in metabolism. Mustard oil is, in fact, now 
suspected to provide some protection against cardiovascular diseases, 
and sufficient saturated fats in the diet apparently protect against 
heart lesions from this oil and Canola oil, even for male rats. 
Currently, it is suspected the heart lesions are caused by excess 
Omega-3 fats, because Flax Seed Oil causes the same problem. It is high 
in Omega-3 fats, but has no erucic acid.</p>

<p>Mustard oil is high in the vegetable form of Omega-3 fatty acids
(6% to 11%), which can, under some circumstances, be converted in the 
body to the more useful fish oil form. Omega-3 is fragile and is probably  
at least partially destroyed when the oil is brought to the smoke point.
