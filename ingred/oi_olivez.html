<h1>Olive Oil</h1>

[Oleaceae]

<p>Here we have the king of both cooking and salad oils with a range of 
quality and flavors we associate with wine. The Finest olive oils do tend 
to come from areas famed for wine: Italy, California, Greece (OK, retsina 
may not be to your taste) and Spain. Turkey, Lebanon and Tunisia also 
makes fine olive oil, and could make good wine but for the prohibitions 
of Islamic law. Of these, Italy and California produce the top quality 
oils. Italians import huge quantities of olives from Spain and Greece, 
so oil labeled "Italian" isn't guaranteed made from Italian grown olives. 
In fact it may contain little oil of Italian manufacture at all.</p>

<p>When I first learned to cook, "health experts" warned us to avoid 
olive oil since it contained more artery clogging saturated fats than 
other vegetable oils. Today it's the only oil both the warring seed oil 
and coconut oil partisans agree is healthy, and it's the darling of both 
gourmets and natural foods enthusiasts. Now saturated fats are gaining 
favor, hydrogenated oils are the devil, and polyunsaturated vegetable 
oils are trying to avoid demonization. </p>

<h2>General Considerations</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Olive oil is best (and most economically) purchased 
from markets serving Mediterranean communities: Spanish, Italian, Greek, 
Turkish or Levantine. Trader Joe's also usually has a good selection of 
quality olive oils, but only in the Extra Virgin grade. They are the best 
local source I know for California olive oils.
<p>Select the grade appropriate to your use, Extra Virgin isn't necessarily 
what you want (see below). <br><u>Caution:</u> &nbsp; Some cans and bottles 
with pretty pictures of olives all over them are actually "blended oils" with 
more <a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a> or other oils than Olive Oil. 
Read the Ingredients statement on the container.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Olive oil should be stored in a cool place and out 
of direct sunlight. In tightly sealed glass bottles it will keep up to a year 
but should be discarded after that. If stored below 50&deg;F/10&deg;C it 
will become cloudy, and if refrigerated it will become positively murky, but 
it will be unharmed and will clear up if allowed to rest at a warmer 
temperature.

<h3>Grades:</h3> &nbsp; The grades of olive oil can be a bit confusing, 
but the only ones most Americans really need to deal with 
are <em>Extra Virgin</em>, <em>Pure Olive Oil</em> and <em>Olive Pomace</em>. 
The grades are quality grades, not flavor grades, and within any particular 
grade there will be wide differences of flavor depending on maker and country 
of origin. Grades are set by the International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) in 
Europe. The US is not a member of the IOOC but the only significant North 
American producer is California, where, for economic reasons, only Extra 
Virgin grade is made. The official USDA grading system predates the IOOC 
grades but is totally ignored even in North America.


<p>The IOOC grades are listed below, with the ones you're likely to 
encounter in North American markets underlined:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3><u>Extra Virgin</u></h3> is cold pressed (first pressing)  
    oil with 1% or less oleic acid. The European Union is expected to 
    lower this to 0.8% to make it more meaningful because 1%  includes 
    70% of European production (and just about 100% of California 
    production). Use this oil for salads, condiments and other low 
    temperature uses to preserve the flavor you are paying for.</li>
  <li><b>Fine Virgin</b> is cold pressed oil with 1.5% or less oleic acid. 
    Use the same as Extra Virgin for salads and condiments.</li>
  <li><b>Virgin</b> is cold pressed oil with 2% or less oleic acid - used 
    for salads, cooking and low temperature frying (up to 
    320&deg;F/160&deg;C).</li>
  <li><b>Semi-Fine Virgin</b> can have oleic acid as high as 3.3% and is 
    best used for cooking and low temperature frying.</li>
  <li><b>Lampante Virgin</b> can have flavor defects and oleic acid 
    higher than 3.3% and is not used for direct human consumption but 
    rather as feed stock for making refined olive oil.</li>
  <li><h3><u>Pure Olive Oil</u></h3> (also called just "Olive Oil") 
    is generally a blend of 85% refined oil and 15% virgin oil. It's a 
    good general cooking oil for use at higher temperatures than virgin 
    oil (up to 410&deg;F/210&deg;C) and accounts for 80% of the oil 
    consumed in Spain and Portugal. With very little olive flavor it is 
    suitable for all ethnic cooking where a specialty oil is not called 
    for. It is the best general purpose oil for the kitchen.</li>
  <li><b>Refined Olive Oil</b> is virgin or second pressing oil refined 
    to remove flavor defects and high acidity. The final acidity is 0.3% 
    or less, and it has no characteristic olive oil flavor. It is a good 
    cooking oil that can stand higher temperatures than virgin oils. 
    Unlike other refined oils, chemical solvents are not used for this 
    grade.</li>
  <li><h3><u>Light</u></h3> or <b>Mild</b> olive oil is filtered to 
    remove much of the olive oil flavor, and is in some cases a blend of 
    olive and other oils. These products are sold mostly to the yuppie
    market at "value added" prices. "Light" refers to flavor and it has 
    just as many calories as any other olive oil.</li> 
  <li><h3><u>Olive Pomace Oil</u></h3> is olive oil extracted with heat 
    and solvents from the crushed residue left from making better grade 
    oils and is then refined. This process is similar to that used to 
    produce seed oils, but olive better stands up to the process because 
    of its low polyunsaturate content. Olive Pomace and Avocado Oil are 
    the best deep fry oils you can afford.
    <br>Olive Pomace lacks any olive oil character and is not generally 
    found in supermarkets, though markets serving ethnic populations 
    often have it, generally in 3 liter cans. Most is sold to commercial 
    food processors who use it because it is low cost and can stand 
    higher temperatures than any other olive oil, but can still be listed 
    as healthful "olive oil" in the ingredients. In truth, the health 
    benefits of olive oil are uniform throughout the quality grades.
    <br><b><u>Caution</u>:</b> the term "Pomace Oil" is insufficiently 
    specific, and some oils under that label are actually mostly Canola 
    Oil or some other inferior oil. Read the Ingredients statement on the 
    container. Some Olive pomace oil is blended with a small amount of 
    virgin oil to improve flavor, but for deep frying pure olive pomace 
    is better.</li> 
  </ul>
 
  <h3>Important Note:</h3> &nbsp; "Pomace" grade olive oil is 
  extracted using heat and solvents, and is then refined. Some so-called 
  "experts" say this makes it unfit for human consumption - and then 
  recommend <a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a> produced by an even 
  more intense process. <u>All</u> oils usable at high frying temperatures 
  are refined by these same processes. Olive Oil goes through fewer steps 
  and its unique composition makes it better able to withstand the stress. 
  Canola oil, with it's high percentage of polyunsaturated oils, fares 
  much worse, and others are worse than Canola. Note that "refined" olive 
  oil (found mostly as "Pure Olive Oil") and Avocado Oil are possibly the 
  only 400&deg;F oils that is not solvent extracted.

  <h3>Usage Guidelines:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Extra Virgin</b> is used for "drizzling", for condiments, salad 
    dressings and other low temperature applications where a distinctive 
    olive oil flavor is desired. It can be used for low temperature 
    frying and braising but will lose its distinctive flavor if heated 
    to 300&deg;F/150&deg;C or beyond.</li>
  <li><b>Pure Olive Oil</b> should be the main cooking oil in your 
    kitchen - a superb multi-use oil. It can be used the same as Extra 
    Virgin wherever the distinctive flavor of ExtV is undesirable.  It's 
    flavor is sufficiently neutral for Asian and other ethnic cooking. 
    &Uuml;ber-expert Julie Sahni considers it just fine for Indian 
    recipes. It can be used for all moderate temperature saut&eacute; 
    and braising applications and for moderate temperature deep frying, 
    anything below 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</li>
  <li><b>"Lite" Olive Oil</b> is for when you want to avoid 
    polyunsaturated oils but want a flavorless oil, and don't mind paying 
    more. Effectively, it's the same as refined olive oil but "filtered" 
    rather than "refined", so the price is a lot higher - it's sold 
    mainly into the yuppie market. <u>Caution</u>: some "Lite" olive 
    oils are blended with Canola Oil or other inferior oils.</li>
  <li><b>Olive Pomace</b> is used for intense deep frying with 
    temperatures even up to 450&deg;F/235&deg;C. You can also use it as 
    you would "Lite" olive oil if the words "solvent extracted" and 
    "refined" don't scare you, but I'd instead recommend Pure Olive Oil 
    which you should always have on hand.</li>
  <li><b>Olive Canola Blends</b> seem a way to make a cheaper oil and still 
    use "olive oil" on the label. A decent moderate temperature frying 
    oil (to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C) with little or no distinctive olive oil 
    flavor. Certainly healthier than corn or soy oil (way lower in 
    polyunsaturates) but less durable (higher oxidation factor) than 
    pure olive oil for deep frying. Use it for short "use once" 
    applications.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Reusing Olive Oil</h2>

<p>Because it is more durable than any other common frying oil except 
beef tallow, olive oil from deep frying can be reused within limits. It 
should be immediately strained through a plain white paper towel and 
stored in a sealed jar. It should not be kept long before reuse because 
it could have picked up less durable components from what was fried in 
it. If it was used for frying fish it should not be used for any other 
application than frying fish.</p>

<h2>Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>

<p>Olive Oils are the safest, most healthful and generally useful oils 
you can buy. Of course the Coconut Oil proponents would dispute that, 
but their Virgin Coconut Oil only goes to 350&deg;F so it fails 
"generally useful". Refined Coconut oil does go to 
450&deg;F/235&deg;C, but most Coconut Oil enthusiasts insist of Virgin. 
See our pages <a href="oilshealth.html">Oils and Health</a> and 
<a href="oilchart.html">Oils - Smoke Temperature &amp; 
Composition</a> for a lot more on this subject.</p>

<h2>Fraud</h2>

<p>Olive oil fraud is rampant, particularly in Italy (also noted for wine 
made without grapes) and Spain. Usually this amounts to dying a cheap oil 
like sunflower greenish, but people have died in Spain from industrial 
grade rapeseed oil (see <a href="oi_canolz.html">Canola Oil</a>) colored 
with a toxic dye. Little of this crap gets to North America, but how much 
less serious cheating does get here is currently a mater of intense 
debate.
</p>
<p>What does get here is plenty of oil labeled "Italian" with little 
Italian content. US law requires full disclosure but the law is widely 
ignored. In Europe olive oil with any Italian content can be labeled 
"Italian".</p>
