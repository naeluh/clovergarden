<span class=bg><b>Oils <small>&amp;</small> Fats</b> (all lumped as 
"Fats" by food scientists) are essential to human nutrition, providing 
not only energy and a feeling of "fullness" but transport for many 
flavors and for a large range of oil soluble vitamins obtainable no 
other way, and are even part of cell wall structure. Oils and Fats can 
also have very negative effects on health</span>

<h2 id="hist">History</h2>

<p>Before the first permanent settlements, nutrient oils came from 
insects, animals, nuts and grains eaten on a "catch as you can" basis. 
Nomadic people learned to render fat from animals and how to use it for 
cooking and to preserve foods with a combination of fat, smoking and sun 
drying.</p>
<p> Once villages were established the technology of extracting oils by 
heat and pressure was quickly refined and oils were extracted from oily 
fruits (olives, mainly, and perhaps sunflower seeds) as well as animals. 
Properly processed oils and fats could be stored much longer than the 
perishables they were extracted from and could tide a village over times 
of food shortage.</p>
<p>Even so, most communities had only a single dominant type of oil and 
little else. Modern technology and transportation have provided us with a 
wealth of flavors for a wide choice for different cooking methods and for 
health. The health part, however, has become highly controversial (see our 
article <a href="oilshealth.html"><b>Oils, Fats and Health</b></a>).</p>


<h2 id="var">Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>General</h3>: &nbsp; Oils and fats are pretty uniform at 120 calories 
per tablespoon. The only exceptions are semi-solid products sold whipped 
with a lot of air - fewer calories by the tablespoon but still the same 
per ounce. The words "Light", "Lite" and similar applied to oils refer 
to taste, not to calories.

<p>For <b>Smoke Point</b> and <b>Fat Type Content</b>, refer to our 
<a href="oilchart.html"><b>Oils Chart</b></a>.</p>

<hr class=hr2>

<h3>Achiote Oil / Lard</h3> - see <a href="oils.html#annatto"><b>Annatto Oil</b></a>.
<p></p>
<h3>Almond Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_almond01c.jpg" alt="Whole Almonds" class=mrg>
While the smoke point of refined almond oil is high (495&deg;F/255&deg;C), 
you're more likely to find this oil as an "unrefined" oil which should be 
used for low temperature applications because taking it too high 
will destroy the flavor you paid extra for.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="annatto">Annatto Oil / Annatto Lard</h3> &nbsp; - 
  &nbsp; [Lara (Spanish), Achiote Oil / Lard]
<br><img src="img/oi_annatto05c.jpg" alt="Annatto Oil &amp; Seeds" class=mrg>
<p>
Oil or <a href="oils.html#lard">lard</a> infused with <a href="sp_annattz.html">
Annatto Seeds</a> which dye it an 
intense red-gold color (orange to  yellow as thinned) and give it a subtle 
warm flavor. This oil is important in Cuban, Filipino, Portuguese, Mexican, 
Puerto Rican, and Jamaican Cooking.</p>
<p>You can make it easily by adding 1/2 cup annatto seeds to 1 cup oil 
(or 1 cup annatto to 1 cup lard) then heating and stirring over moderate heat 
until the desired color is achieved (overheating will cause it to lose its 
red color and flavor). Alternately for oil, heat to 350&deg;F, take off heat 
and stir in annatto. Continue stirring until foaming stops and desired color 
is achieved.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Argan Oil</h3>
<br><a href="oi_arganz.html">
<img src="img/oi_argan02c.jpg" alt="Argan Fruit" class=mrg></a>
This oil was, until recently, almost unknown outside Morocco. It is used 
as a dipping oil, as a cooking oil, and is important in cosmetics, having 
a very high vitamin E and phenol content. This oil is now much more widely 
known due to conservation efforts and is now exported as a high value 
product making properly managing the trees economical.

<h3>Avocado Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_avocado01c.jpg" alt="Whole Avocado Fruit" class=mrg>
Here we have a real smoke point champion (520&deg;F/270&deg;C). If you 
want to sear meat quickly, or some other very high temperature 
application, this is the way to go. It has a lightly buttery flavor and 
is also a very healthy oil with a profile similar to Olive Oil. It is 
becoming more widely available and here in Southern California can be 
had at costs similar to quality olive oil.
<br class=cll>

<h3 id="beef">Beef Fat</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Suet, Tallow]
<br><img src="img/oi_cow02c.jpg" alt="Live Cow" class=mrg>
Suet is fat from the abdominal cavity of a cow or sheep and makes the 
best tallow, but meat packers more likely use any fat found on the animal. 
This is "rendered" by boiling and skimming to produce a purified white 
fat called tallow.
<p> Well made tallow can be kept at room temperature much longer than 
suet without spoiling. This fat was once used to make candles and as a 
lubricant but today is used mainly to make soap and industrial products, 
and by "fast food" restaurants as a low cost ingredient. It is also 
favored as a binder and nutrient in making winter feed blocks for song 
birds.</p>
<p>Beef fat is, of course, the primary flavoring and moistening agent in 
beef, particularly American beef which has been bred and fed to maximize 
"marbling". Consequently, fat cannot be largely removed from beef as it 
can be from other animal meats because it's shot through the muscle. On 
the other hand, the beef is of inferior edibility without it.

<h3 id="butter">Butter / Ghee</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_butter1.jpg" alt="Butter &amp; Ghee" class=mrg>
Whole butter is a mix of fats, milk solids and moisture derived by 
churning cream until the oil droplets stick together and can be separated 
out. Shown are the standard 1 pound block and 1/4 pound sticks, and a jar of 
ghee (see below). Note that east of the Mississippi 1/4 pound sticks are 
longer and narrower.
<p>Butter is high in saturated fats which cause it to be solid at normal 
room temperature. Whole butter can be used only at low temperatures 
because included milk protein solids brown and then burn easily. 
Overheated butter loses much of its flavor and severely overheated butter 
will be bitter.</p>
<p>Note that observant Jews cannot fry any dish containing meat in any 
form of Butter, because mixing dairy with meats is forbidden. For this 
reason they make considerable use of 
<a href="../recipes/eim_schmaltz1.html"><b>Schmaltz</b></a> (rendered 
chicken or goose fat).
<br class=cll></p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Clarified Butter:</h3> &nbsp; This is butter that has been 
  warmed until it is liquid. Any residue that floats to the top is 
  skimmed off and discarded, the clear oil is poured off and the solids 
  that sink to the bottom are discarded. Clarified butter can be used at 
  a higher temperature than whole butter and is resistant to rancidity, 
  but it does lack much of the flavor of whole butter.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very thoroughly 
  clarified and purified butter fat used as a major cooking oil through 
  much of India and surrounding regions.  Because it is so thoroughly 
  purified of all moisture and solids it can be used at higher 
  temperature and is much more resistant to rancidity than more casually 
  purified clarified butter. Pots of ghee buried by nomads have been 
  found in excellent condition even after a couple hundred years. 
  &nbsp; <a href="oi_gheez.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
  
  <p>Many Indians now use <b>Vegetable Ghee</b> [vanaspati ghee, Dalda], 
  similar to Western vegetable shortening, because they've been told it 
  is healthier, and it is cheaper. Unfortunately much of it is made using 
  trans fats, now known to be very non-healthy. Some is made using 
  Coconut Oil which is probably much healthier. This brings us to points 
  of great controversy (see our <a href="oilshealth.html">Oils and 
  Health</a> page).</p> </li>
  <li><h3>Sweet Butter:</h3> &nbsp; This is butter that has not been 
  salted. It's called for by many European recipes, and an increasing 
  number of North American recipes. It would seem if you're going to add 
  salt anyway salted butter would be fine, but gourmets say they get 
  better control adding all salt separately. Sweet butter will go rancid 
  much more quickly than salted butter so must be kept refrigerated and 
  used in a short time.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Camellia Oil</h3> - see <a href="oils.html#tea"><b>Tea Oil</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Camelina Oil</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [False Flax, 
  <i>Camelina sativa</i>]
<br><img src="img/cb_camelin01c.jpg" alt="Camelina Flowers" class=mrg>
<p>
This oil, from the seeds of a plant of the mustard family, is getting 
a lot of attention due to the very favorable Omega-6 / Omega-3 balance 
(23.0% / 31.2%) and its high content of antioxidants and vitamin E which 
make it quite resistant to oxidation. Used as a cooking oil it has a 
slight almond flavor. It is also getting a lot of attention as a possible 
biofuel for jet engines. This plant is native to Europe and Central Asia, 
and has been cultivated as an oil seed plant for at least 4000 years.

<h3 id="canola">Canola Oil</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Lear Oil, <i>Brassica campestris</i>]
<br><a href="oi_canolz.html">
<img src="img/oi_canola05c.jpg" alt="Canola Flowers" class=mrg></a>
<p>
"Canola" is an invented name (Canada + oil + low acid) for genetically 
modified rapeseed oil.  Technically it is "low erucic acid, low 
glucosinolates rapeseed oil". Originally this modification was by breeding 
but recently it's by "engineering", with 80% of the crop now considered "GM".</p>
<p>Rapeseed oil was long an important lubricant for machinery exposed to water 
and steam, so during World War II, when European and Asian supplies were cut 
off, large plantings were established in Canada. After the war new markets 
needed to be found, so voila! "Health food".</p>
<p>Rape is a member of the mustard / cabbage family. Stems of leaves are 
sold in Asian markets as Yu Choy, and it's a fine vegetable - but unmodified 
rapeseed oil is high in erucic acid, thought to cause of heart lesions 
in humans and animals. The FDA consider it unfit for food. The genetically 
modified Canola version  has under 2% erucic acid and is listed by the FDA 
as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), though it's rumored that listing cost 
Canada a bundle.</p>
<p>Canola is now intensely promoted by the seed oil industry as the healthiest 
of all cooking oils, pointing to it's high monounsaturated and Omega-3 fat 
contents. The success of this promotion is shown by the many cookbooks now 
specifically listing Canola oil in every recipe calling for cooking 
oil. As usual with industry promotions, there's negative stuff swept 
under the carpet. Some experts point to dangers and a few even call it 
unfit for human consumption - but those shrill Internet tracts about mustard 
gas are completely without merit.  For more details see our

<h3>Castor Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_castor05h.jpg" alt="Castor Beans" class=mrg>
Pressed from the seeds of a member of the spurge family, this oil tastes 
awful so you don't want to use if for cooking. Traditionally, castor oil 
was used as a gentle laxative and to induce vomiting. Today it is 
used in a large number of industrial products and processes, but not in 
food. The beans from which it is squeezed also contain ricin, one of the 
most toxic substances known, but it is not in the oil.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="chicken">Chicken Fat</h3>
<br><img src="img/bd_chkredjung02c.jpg"  alt="Live Chicken" class=mrg>
Important in European Jewish cooking but otherwise little used today. 
<a href="../recipes/eim_schmaltz1.html"><b>Schmaltz</b></a> (rendered 
chicken or goose fat) is used as a spread for bread and to cook chopped 
liver and potato pancakes. Goose fat is preferred for its flavor, if 
available.

<h3>Coconut Oil</h3>
<br><a href="oi_cocoz.html">
<img src="img/oi_coconut02c.jpg"  alt="Whole Coconut" class=mrg></a>
Coconut oil is either the most deadly oil you can consume, or the 
most healthy cooking oil on earth - depending on which panel of "experts" 
you chose to believe. Demographics favor "healthy". It is the most 
used cooking oil in southeast India, Maylasia, Indonesia and the 
Philippines - not regions noted for high incidence of congestive 
heart disease.

<p>Coconut oil is 91% saturated fats and only 3% polyunsaturated fats. 
It is highly resistant to rancidity, so can be stored at room 
temperature for long periods of time, and is a preferred ingredient for 
many products that will be stored at room temperature. Of course, 
with all that saturated fat it's pretty stiff, with a melting point of 
76&deg;F/24.4&deg;C.</p>

<p>Coconut oil has an extremely low oxidation factor so it is highly 
durable as a frying oil, even more durable than beef tallow. Virgin oil 
has to be kept below 350&deg;F/175&deg;C,  but RBD (refined) oil can go 
as high as 450&deg;F/232&deg;C.
 &nbsp; <a href="oi_cocoz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cod Liver Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_cod01.jpg" alt="Whole Cod Fish" class=mrg>
See <a href="oils.html#fish">Fish Oil</a> except cod liver oil is very high in 
vitamin D and used as a supplement for those short of that vitamin.

<h3 id="corn">Corn Oil</h3> &nbsp; -  &nbsp; [Maize Oil (UK)]
<br><img src="img/oi_corn05c.jpg" alt="Cobs of Corn" class=mrg>
<p>
Corn oil, along with Soy Oil is a dominant ingredient in supermarket general 
purpose frying/salad oil. This oil is manufactured in vast quantity in the 
U.S. (and corn growers are promoting it as a motor fuel in hopes of pushing 
the price up). Since there are better oils for any particular purpose, and 
even for general purpose (<a href="oils.html#grape">Grape Seed</a>, 
<a href="oils.html#canola">Canola</a>), I see no reason to use it unless price is the 
only consideration.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cottonseed Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_cotton01c.jpg" alt="Cotton Boll" class=mrg>
Rarely found on store shelves, cottonseed oil is used in massive  
quantity by the food industry, particularly for salad dressing and for 
hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil products such as 
<a href="oils.html#vshort">vegetable shortening</a>, <a href="oils.html#marg">margarine</a> 
and hydrogenated fry oils used by the fast food and snack food industries. 
New "zero trans fats" products generally depend on fully hydrogenated 
cottonseed oil for their room temperature solidity and resistance to 
heat and rancidity. &nbsp; <small>Photo by USDA = public domain.</small>
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Dende Oil</h3> - see <a href="oils.html#palm"><b>Palm Oil</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Duck Fat</h3>
<br><img src="img/bd_dkpekin01c.jpg" alt="Live Duck" class=mrg>
Duck and Goose fat are very flavorful and particularly excellent for frying 
potatoes. As with all animal fats the smoke point is moderate 
(375&deg;F/190&deg;C) and you don't want to get too close to it or you'll 
lose flavor, so fry slowly. This is not a commercial product in the U.S., 
so you'll have to render your own when you cook a duck.
<p><b>Duck Butter</b> is a water soluble lubricant used in stretch forming 
aircraft skins and in plumbing. I'm not sure if it is now or ever was made 
out of ducks. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0035</a>.</small>
<br class=cll>

<h3 id="fish">Fish Oils</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_cod01.jpg" alt="Whole Fish" class=mrg>
Fish oils are generally not sold in bottles for cooking use (though 
health food purveyors do sell it in capsules). Fish oils are particularly 
high in Omega-3 polyunsaturated oils which all sides of the oils vs. 
health battles pretty much agree is highly beneficial. Omega-3 oils 
appears to reduce the incidence of various cancers to perhaps an even 
greater degree than the Omega-9 monounsaturated oils in 
<a href="oils.html#olive">Olive Oil</a>.
<p>This opinion appears to be supported by the evidence of ethnic 
populations that eat a lot of fish. These oils are best added to the diet 
by eating oily fish such as mackerel, tuna, salmon and herring. While the 
body can convert the Omega-3 in vegetable oils (flax, canola) into the 
Omega-3 oils found in fish, that process can be blocked by a number of 
factors, including those evil trans fats again.
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#bstock">b0008</a></small>
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="flax">Flaxseed Oil</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Linseed Oil]
<br><img src="img/oi_flaxseed01.jpg" alt="Flax Seeds" class=mrg>
<p>
Flaxseed oil is sold as a food supplement rather than for cooking. 
Fiber from the seeds is sometimes included as it is considered beneficial 
at some dosages. Flaxseed oil has its cachet from an Omega-3 fatty acid 
known as alfa-linolenic acid.</p>
<p>From its Omega-3 content flaxseed oil is compared to fish oil, but 
the comparison isn't necessarily valid because the Omega-3 oils in fish 
oil are very different from that in flaxseed and canola oils. The major 
uses of flaxseed oil are still paints, varnish and industrial products.
<br class=cll></p>


<h3>Ghee</h3> - see <a href="oils.html#butter"><b>Butter</b></a> and

<h3 id="goose">Goose Fat</h3>
<br><img src="img/bd_goosedg01c.jpg" alt="Live Goose" class=mrg>
Goose and Duck fat are very flavorful and particularly excellent for frying 
potatoes. As with all animal fats the smoke point is moderate 
(375&deg;F/190&deg;C) and you don't want to get too close to it or you'll 
lose flavor, so fry slowly. This is not a commercial product in the U.S., 
so you'll have to render your own when you cook your goose. Goose fat is 
used as a tastier alternative to chicken fat for 
<a href="../recipes/eim_schmaltz1.html"><b>Schmaltz</b></a> in European 
Jewish cuisine.
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0026</a>.</small>
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h3 id="grape">Grape Seed Oil:</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_grape01c.jpg" alt="Red and Green Grapes" class=mrg>
This is promoted as an excellent all-around frying oil because it has a very 
high smoke temperature (480&deg;F/250&deg;C for refined oil) and is highly 
resistant to breaking down. Once again, be aware of gourmet "cold pressed" 
or "virgin" oils which will smoke at a much lower temperature.
<p>With its unobtrusive flavor, grape seed oil can be used for Chinese 
stir fry in place of <a href="oils.html#peanut">Peanut Oil</a> called for in many 
recipes.Grape seed oil is higher in polyunsaturates than some other oils 
see(<a href="oilchart.html"><b>Oils Chart</b></a>) but has a high 
anti-oxidant content so it resists rancidity better than many vegetable 
oils. One caution: it's a fast drying oil so you want to clean up 
splatter right away because cleaning will be a lot harder in a few days. 
On the other hand, this makes it very good for seasoning bare steel and 
cast iron cookware.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="jojoba">Jojoba Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_jojoba02c.jpg" alt="Jojoba Flower" class=mrg>
Pronounced "hohoba" this oil is actually a liquid wax (waxes and oils are 
closely related). The main culinary interest in jojoba is as an appetite 
suppressant (it produces a satisfying full feeling without contributing 
a lot of calories) but this is still in the experimental stages. Currently 
it is popular as a cosmetic oil and as the only lubricant that can replace 
<a href="oils.html#whale">Sperm Whale Oil</a>. Jojoba beans grow on a shrub native 
to the deserts of southwest U.S. but experimental plantings have been 
made in Egypt and elsewhere.

<h3 id="lard">Lard</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Pig Fat]
<br><img src="img/oi_boar02c.jpg" alt="Live Boar" class=mrg>
Lard is made by "rendering" fat cut from pigs by frying or boiling and 
skimming. It was once the most popular cooking and baking fat in North 
America and Europe, but has largely been replaced by vegetable shortenings 
in North America due to a misplaced fear of saturated fats. It's still 
heavily used in Latin American cooking and parts of Europe. Now that 
evil <a href="oilshealth.html#trans">trans fats</a> in vegetable 
shortening are found very dangerous and saturated fats not so much so, pig 
is back in the running. Experts say the health implications for lard are 
about the same as for butter. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0075</a>.
</small> 
<p>
<b>Lard</b> is still by far the best fat for many baking uses such as 
pie crusts, but U.S. supermarket lard tends to be of poor quality and 
heavily processed. The best lard to use for baking is called 
"<b>leaf lard</b>" which is made from the fat from around the pigs 
kidneys. It is available from some specialists 
(<a href="oils.html#o4"><b>O4</b></a>).

<h3 id="marg">Margarine</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_margarine1.jpg" alt="Block and Blob of Margarine" class=mrg>
This butter substitute sold in 1/4 pound blocks, tubs and other forms 
is vegetable oil (largely soy and corn) caused to be solid at room 
temperature by "partial hydrogenation". Back in the '60s health gurus 
told us to use margarine instead of butter to avoid dangerous heart 
killing saturated fat, but today we are told hydrogenation produces evil 
<a href="oilshealth.html#trans">Trans Fats</a> which are known to be 
worse than saturated fats.
<p>"Soft margarine" sold in tubs has a much lower trans fat content. See 
our <a href="oilchart.html#marg"><b>Oils Chart</b></a> for details. Of course 
this product doesn't work well where a more solid product is needed such 
as baking, where you might as well use <a href="oils.html#lard">leaf lard</a> 
which provides the best results and is now no more dangerous than 
<a href="oils.html#butter">Butter</a>.</p>
<p>Margarine was originally made from beef suet and lard as a cheap 
substitute for butter, but by the 1920s it was manufactured entirely from 
low cost vegetable oils.</p>
<p>When I was a child my parents bought margarine when butter was a lot 
more expensive. It was white then by law due to pressure from the dairy 
lobby and I got to break open the capsule of yellow dye and stir it into 
the white margarine until it looked sort of like butter.</p> 
<p>On my own I've never used margarine because the flavor and texture 
remind me too much of axle grease. I figured dying sooner from butter 
would still be the better deal overall. Now there's no reason to use it 
at all since the trans fat issue has reduced the margarine promoters to 
telling us their product is "nowhere near as bad as you've heard".

<h3>Mineral Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_mineral1.jpg" alt="Bottle of Mineral Oil" class=mrg>
Mineral oil has medicinal uses but its main use in the kitchen is to 
saturate your cutting board and other wood items to make them water 
resistant. Unlike vegetable oils, mineral oil will never go rancid or 
dry into a varnish.
<p>Made from the same basic feed stock as diesel fuel and gasoline, 
mineral oil is refined until it is water clear and safe for human 
consumption - but it's indigestible and should never be used for cooking. 
Basically, it's a liquid form of vaseline. Find it at a local pharmacy 
or in the medicines section of your local supermarket.

<h3>Mustard Oil</h3>
<br><a href="oi_mustz.html">
<img src="img/cb_mustoil02c.jpg" alt="Mustard Oil and Seeds" class=mrg></a>
Mustard oil is important in India, particularly in Bengal (northeast India 
and Bangladesh) but also in Goa and other parts of northern India and 
Pakistan. Many consider this oil essential to get the proper flavor for 
recipes from these regions.
<p>This oil is  unique in that usage calls for heating to the smoke point, 
but only for a second or two. The flavor of raw mustard oil is harsh, but 
brought to the smoke point and then cooling down a bit the flavor becomes 
much more pleasing.</p>
<p>Because of its high erucic acid content, a substance formerly thought 
to be dangerous, all mustard oil sold in the U.S. and the European Union 
carries the warning "For Massage Use Only" in small print on the label. 
Demographic data and recent research suggest there is no significant risk 
(except to male rats).

<h3 id="olive">Olive Oil</h3>
<br><a href="oi_olivez.html">
<img src="img/oi_olive01.jpg" alt="Olives and Bottle of Oil" class=mrg></a>
Here we have the king of both cooking and salad oils with a range of 
quality and flavors we associate with wine. The Finest olive oils do tend 
to come from areas famed for wine: Italy, California, Greece (OK, retsina 
isn't to our taste) and Spain. Turkey, Lebanon and Tunisia also makes 
fine olive oil, and could make good wine but for the prohibitions of 
Islamic law. Of these, Italy and California produce the top quality oils. 
Italians import huge quantities of olives from Spain and Greece, so oil 
labeled "Italian" isn't guaranteed made from Italian grown olives. In 
fact it may contain little oil of Italian manufacture at all. Fraud is 
rampant in the European olive oil market.

<p>When I first learned to cook, health "experts" warned us to avoid 
olive oil since it contained more artery clogging saturated fats than 
other vegetable oils. Today it's the only oil both the warring seed oil 
and coconut oil partisans agree is healthy and it's the darling of both 
gourmets and natural foods enthusiasts. Now saturated fats are gaining 
favor, hydrogenated oils are the devil and polyunsaturated vegetable oils 
are trying to avoid demonization.  
<a href="oi_olivez.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="omega">Omega-3, Omega-6, Omega-9 Fats</h3>
<br>Omega-6 are your standard polyunsaturated fats found in vegetable 
oils. Omega-3 fats, particularly from fish and crustaceans, are 
considered to promote health, while Omega-6 fats are considered by some 
to promote heart disease and cancer. See our article 
<a href="oilshealth.html"><b>Oils, Fats &amp; Health</b></a>. Omega-9 
is monounsaturated fat as in olive oil.
<p>There is debate over the validity of relating Omega-3 in vegetable oils 
(<a href="oils.html#canola">Canola</a> and <a href="oils.html#flax">Flaxseed</a>) to the 
health benefits of fish oils, as the Omega-3 oils in fish are quite 
different from the ones in vegetable oils, and the vegetable ones come 
with many times the percentage of Omega-6 compared to fish.

<h3 id="palm">Palm Oil / Dende Oil</h3> 
<br><a href="oi_dendz.html">
<img src="img/oi_dende02c.jpg" alt="Dish of Red Palm Oil" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Dend&ecirc; oil is much used in parts of West Africa, and in parts of 
Brazil influenced by Africa, particularly the Bahia region. It is 
considered essential for the proper color and flavor of dishes from 
those regions.</p>
<p>This oil is derived from the mesocarp, the red pulp surrounding the 
fruit of oil palms, not from the palm kernel. It is about 37% 
monounsaturated fats and 51% saturated fats (kernel oil is over 82% 
saturated fats), and it is high in vitamin E and antioxidants. The red 
color comes from alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, the same 
as from tomatoes.

<h3 id="peanut">Peanut Oil</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Ground Nut Oil (UK)]
<br><img src="img/oi_peanut1.jpg" alt="Whole and Shelled Peanuts" class=mrg>
<p>
Planter's peanut oil used to be wildly popular and in every grocery but 
now any peanut oil is hard to find. Acquisition of Planters and near 
destruction of its brand name and markets is a textbook case for the 
incompetence of overpaid corporate executives and wrote "fini" to the 
then popular management theory that "a trained manager can manage 
anything".</p> 
<p>Peanuts are actually legumes (beans) rather than nuts, so general 
comments about "nut oils" do not apply.</p>
<p>Peanut oil is called for particularly in Chinese cooking because its 
light flavor does not detract from the flavor of quickly stir fried 
ingredients and its high smoke point lends it to that style of frying. I 
find "house brand" peanut oil in gallon jugs and 5 gallon cans at a local 
restaurant supply store, but substitutes like <a href="oils.html#grape">grape seed 
oil</a> are now available everywhere (peanut is lower in polyunsaturates).

<h3>Rapeseed Oil</h3> - Oil of a seed in the mustard family. 
Traditional rapeseed oil is not considered suitable for human consumption 
in North America but is widely used in Asia. Only in times of famine does 
it cause heart lesions there, because under normal conditions enough 
saturated fat is consumed with it to protect the heart. A genetically 
modified version "market named" <a href="oils.html#canola">Canola Oil</a> is now 
widely used in North America, particularly for "healthy" restaurant and 
food processing use.<p></p>

<h3>Rice Bran Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_riredi01h.jpg" alt="Brown Rice Grains" class=mrg>
Extracted from the byproducts of milling brown rice into white, this oil 
has a fat profile almost identical to Peanut Oil except it is much higher 
in antioxidants, can go to even higher temperatures and is OK for people 
allergic to nut oils. It is quite neutral in flavor so is suitable for 
applications where the distinctive flavor of Olive Oil is not wanted. 
Formerly an upscale "health food" cooking oil, oils from California 
and Italy are now appearing at prices in the Olive Oil range. It is 
widely used as a cosmetic and anti-aging oil as well as in sunscreens.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Safflower</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_saffl01c.jpg" alt="Safflower Flowers" class=mrg>
Safflower is a member of the sunflower family, but its oil is even higher 
in polyunsaturated fat and lower in saturated fat than sunflower oil. 
This extreme composition means it does not solidify when refrigerated, which 
has made it a favorite for production of salad dressings. It also has a very 
high smoke point, 510&deg;F/265&deg;C. A very useful oil unless you are one 
of the growing number that suspects polyunsatuates are evil.

<h3>Schmaltz</h3> - (from German schmalz: rendered fat (commonly 
pork fat in Germany)) rendered <a href="oils.html#chicken">Chicken Fat</a> or 
<a href="oils.html#goose">Goose Fat</a> used as a spread and as a cooking fat in

<h3 id="seal">Seal Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_seal02c.jpg"  alt="Barking Seal" class=mrg>
Rendered from the fat of seals, this oil is preferred by Alaska's native 
Inuit for cooking, garnishing and dipping. To quote a lady reciting a 
recipe on the radio, "It's delicious, but then anything cooked in seal 
oil would be delicious".
<p>Seal oil is rather difficult to get in the lower 48 and Hawaii, so 
you really have to know someone in Alaska or northern Canada willing to 
smuggle some down. Alternatively, it's easy to make it yourself. When 
you cut up your seal, take all the blubber and cut it in chunks. Put 
the chunks in a bucket which you keep at about 40&deg;F somewhere the 
dogs can't get at it. In about 5 days the oil will have rendered out 
and can be used as is or can be filtered and purified depending on 
your needs (if your outdoor temperature is above 40&deg;F you might 
want to render by boiling and skimming instead).

<h3>Sesame Seed Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_sesame01.jpg" alt="Light and Dark Sesame Oil" class=mrg>
This oil, pressed from tiny sesame seeds, is available in several 
distinctly different varieties. The photo shows Gingelly on the left and 
Dark sesame oil on the right (with sesame seeds in the front).
<p>Store these relatively perishable oils in a cool place away from light in 
tightly sealed containers and they should last up to 9 months. Since I use 
little of it I usually store a small can of the dark sesame oil in the 
refrigerator (it does not solidify) to extend its life.
<br class=cll> 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Sesame Oil</b> (plain) is seldom found outside the 
        "health food" section. It's very light colored and has most or 
        all of the sesame flavor filtered out. It's commonly packaged in 
        tiny bottles at absurd prices for use as a salad oil or for 
        moderate temperature cooking - but I have a hard time figuring 
        out why.</li>
      <li><b>Gingelly Oil</b> is much used in Singapore and elsewhere 
        in Southeast Asia. It is clear and light yellow in color with 
        a very distinct flavor of crushed sesame seeds. It can be found 
        in Indian groceries and stores catering to Southeast Asian 
        populations. This oil is used for condiments and pickles and 
        should not be used at high temperatures as its flavor will be 
        lost.</li>
      <li><b>Dark</b> sesame oil is familiar from Chinese, Japanese and 
        Korean cuisine. Much darker than Gingelly, this oil is pressed 
        from roasted sesame seeds.and is available in a range of shades 
        and flavors. Use this oil as a flavoring oil, not as a cooking 
        oil. It is generally added to cooked dishes just before they 
        are taken off the heat (except sometimes in Korea).</li>

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/oi_sheab01c.jpg" alt="Open Can of Shea Butter" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This oil is produced from the seeds of the Shea Nut Tree, native across 
equatorial Africa, but also widely grown in Turkey. In North America and 
Europe, Shea Butter is used mostly in cosmetic preparations, but in 
Central Africa it is a major cooking oil. It's properties are similar to 
Palm Oil.

<h3 id="sheep">Sheep Fat</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Lamb Fat, Mutton Fat, 
  Tallow]
<br><img src="img/as_sheep01c.jpg" alt="Two Live Sheep" class=mrg>
<p>
Sheep fat is processed from suet to tallow the same way as 
<a href="oils.html#beef">Beef Fat</a> and is particularly used as a substitute for 
<a href="oils.html#lard">Lard</a> by those living under religious prohibitions 
against pig. Note that in the U.S., mutton is very rare, most sheep being 
slaughtered at less than 1 year of age while they can still be called 
"lamb".</p>

<p>The preferred fat is from the sheep's tail, and in some countries 
sheep are specially bred for large fat laden behinds and tails. Tail fat 
is not available in the U.S. because the tail is always cut off new born 
lambs here. This is to avoid a problem with flies you'd probably rather 
not know about. The other preferred fat comes from around the kidneys, 
same as with <a href="oils.html#leaf">"leaf lard"</a> from pigs.

<h3>Shortening</h3> - see <a href="oils.html#lard">Lard</a> and 
<a href="oils.html#vshort">Vegetable Shortening</a>. Shortening is an animal fat 
or vegetable oil product containing enough saturated fat (or trans fats) 
to make it fairly solid at room temperature - important for pie crusts, 
cookies and other baked goods.
<p></p>

<h3 id="soy">Soy Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_soy1.jpg" alt="Soy Beans" class=mrg>
Soy oil was originally produced for the manufacture of paint, but when the 
air pollution folks forced the paint makers to go to mostly acrylics, the 
soy industry looked for new markets and chose "health food". Now soy oil, 
along with corn oil, dominates the market for general purpose cooking oil 
sold North American supermarkets.
<p>While serious health questions surround some soy products (soy milk 
and TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein)), soybean oil is widely considered 
safe, unless you ask the coconut oil partisans. Because it is high in 
polyunsaturated fats and contains limited antioxidants it is more subject 
to rancidity than, say, olive oil or canola oil, so keep it in tightly 
sealed containers in a cool place away from direct sun and it should be 
good for 9 months or so. For frying, it should be used for only short 
jobs and never reused because of heat rancidity.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Suet</h3> - See <a href="oils.html#beef"><b>Beef Fat</b></a>
<p></p>

<h3>Sunflower Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_sunflower01c.jpg" alt="Vase of Sunflowers" class=mrg>
Sunflower oil is used extensively in Russia and the Black Sea countries 
where sunflowers grow in profusion. Though the sunflower originates from 
North America, it became very popular in Russia and Ukraine because the 
oil was not on the Orthodox Church's "Forbidden for Lent" list. It is 
now the national flower of Ukraine.
<p>Refined sunflower oil is a good all-around cooking oil but not as neutral 
in flavor as grapeseed or peanut. "Virgin" or "cold pressed" sunflower oils 
have a very low smoke point and should not be used for cooking. High in 
polyunsaturates, sunflower oil will go rancid faster than, say, olive oil 
or canola oil. Store it tightly sealed in a cool dark place and use it within 
9 months. For frying it should be used only for short jobs and never reused 
due to heat rancidity.</p>
<p>Genetically manipulated "High Oleic" sunflower oils are now made which 
approach the oil balance of olive oil and are much more durable for deep 
frying than the regular sunflower oil, but are not available on the consumer 
market.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tallow</h3> - See <a href="oils.html#beef"><b>Beef Fat</b></a>

<h3 id="tea">Tea Oil / Camellia Oil</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Oil Seed 
  Camellia; <i>Camellia oleifera</i>]
<br><img src="img/er_camello01c.jpg" alt="Oil Camellia Flower" class=mrg>
<p>
This is <b>NOT</b> "Tea Tree Oil", which is toxic. It is also not made 
from the same species of Camellia used for tea, but from a closely 
related species that yields more oil from its seeds. It is a high 
temprature oil with a health profile better than peanut oil but not 
as good as olive oil. It is a light amber colored oil with a distinctive 
flavor, so is not for use where a neutral oil is needed. This oil is 
much used in southern China, where the tea camillias are also grown. 
It is available in some of the larger Asian markets here in Southern 
California at about 2016 US $8.99 for 600ml, from Taiwan (so it's 
probably unleaded). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="trans">Trans Fats</h3> - Long promoted by health advocates 
as a "safer" replacement for the natural fats we evolved with, this 
factory made product is now known to be the most dangerous type of fat 
commonly used in food. For the full story see our topic 
<a href="oilshealth.html#trans"><b>Trans Fats Bad!</b> - No Longer 
Controversial</a>.
<p></p>

<h3 id="vghee">Vegetable Ghee</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_vghee01.jpg" alt="Vegetable Ghee" class=mrg>
A substitute for <a href="oils.html#butter">Butter Ghee</a> (clarified butter) 
derived from vegetable oils. It became popular in India due to the high 
cost of dairy ghee and because some religious groups use no animal 
products at all. Later it came to be considered healthier than butter 
ghee just as vegetable shortening did in the U.S..
<p>The products I've used are made from 100% palm oil colored with beta 
carotene and with some butter like flavorings added. This casts it deep 
into the <a href="oilshealth.html#saturate">tropical oils 
controversy</a>. I see no problem with the palm oil products, but 
vegetable ghee made from hydrogenated oils would be 
<a href="oilshealth.html#trans">Trans Fats</a> - same problem as with 
North American vegetable shortening and fast food fries.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="voil">Vegetable Oil</h3> - Products so labeled are a blend of 
whatever seed oils the manufacturer can buy most cheaply. Generally they 
will be oils high in polyunsaturates such as <a href="oils.html#soy">Soy</a> and 
<a href="oils.html#corn">Corn</a>. Read the label as it varies greatly, and it 
can even say "may contain" so the manufacturer can vary the composition 
with market fluctuations.
<p></p>


<h3 id="vshort">Vegetable Shortening</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_vshort1.jpg" alt="Solid Vegetable Shortening" class=mrg>
<p>
Proctor and Gamble invented Crisco, the first vegetable 
shortening, because they were being killed in the soap business by 
competitors. They made it from the same cottonseed oil they used for soap 
and sold it based on unverified claims (no FDA back then) that it 
was a "healthier" substitute for <a href="oils.html#lard">Lard</a> in baked goods. 
This sounds just like the recent shift by the <a href="oils.html#soy">soy oil</a> 
folks from paint to "healthier food".</p>
<p>The main requirements for vegetable shortening are to be a fat solid 
at normal room temperature, devoid of distracting flavor and made from 
plants, so vegetable oils, mostly cotton seed, soy and corn, are 
partially hydrogenated to achieve the right consistency.</p>
<p>Unfortunately partially hydrogenated oils are 
<a href="oilshealth.html#trans">evil trans fats</a>, now considered the 
most dangerous type of fat, more dangerous even than evil saturated fats. 
New government labeling laws and a flood of health articles are making 
this product harder to market, so the edible oil industry has responded 
with new formulas (Crisco & others) with very low trans fat content. 
These are made by fully hydrogenating cottonseed oil.</p>
<p>Fully hydrogenated oils have the consistency of a hockey puck, but by 
whipping in unhydrogenated vegetable oils the correct consistency can be 
achieved. Of course fully hydrogenated oils are saturated fats, what they 
were trying to get away from in the first place. It's still about half 
the saturated fats of butter or lard, so it's officially "better for you" 
unless you're more concerned about the high content of 
(<a href="oilshealth.html#poly">dangerous?</a>) polyunsaturates.

<h3>Walnut Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_walnut09h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cracked Walnuts" class=mrg>
While the smoke point of refined walnut oil is reasonably high 
(400&deg;F/200&deg;C), this oil is far more commonly found as an 
"unrefined" oil which should be used for low temperature frying and 
salad applications. Taking it too higher temperatures will destroy the 
flavor you paid extra for.
<p>Walnut oil is much used in the cuisines of Anatolia, Caucasus and 
Persia. California is a major producer (and the world's second largest 
producer of walnuts). but it is not often available in stores, not even 
Trader Joe's. It is, however, easily available on the Internet. 
Refrigerate after opening.

<h3 id="whale">Whale Oil</h3>
<br><img src="img/oi_whale02c.jpg" alt="Leaping Whale" class=mrg>
Whale oil was once heavily used in the U.S. for lamp oil and lubricants 
but not for cooking. The Inuit do use whale oil for cooking as an 
alternative for <a href="oils.html#seal">Seal Oil</a>. Oil from sperm whales 
(actually a liquid wax) is still the best oil for some precision 
lubrication applications but is now generally illegal due to the 
endangered status of whales (the last sperm oil company in the U.S. 
closed in 1978). <a href="oils.html#jojoba">Jojoba Oil</a> is the only somewhat 
satisfactory alternative for whale oil lubricants.
