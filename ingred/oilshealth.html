<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the wonderful wacky world of nutritional science, 
where all sides on any issue point to the others as "junk science" 
supported by faulty studies and distorted by commercial interests, and 
where today's "medical knowledge" is tomorrow's snake oil. All sides in any 
heated health controversy are likely right in part and wrong in part, but 
since this is America, and big money and politics are involved, the truth 
is very difficult to know.</p>

<p>The following material expresses some pretty strong opinions that 
may go counter to the "medical knowledge" you have been taught since 
childhood. If you think we are off the wall here, let us refer you to 
a person who most certainly can issue an authoritative medical opinion  
<a href="oilshealth.html#O24"><b>O24</b></a>.</p>

<p>We will start out with the "science" that is pretty much agreed upon by 
all sides in the oils vs. health battles, then move into the controversy.
</p>

<h2 id="fats">Fats <small>&amp;</small> the Body</h2>

<p>Fats are found in all the cells of the body as energy storage, 
as a structural component of cell walls, and are 
the transport for a number of essential vitamins (known as 
"fat soluble vitamins") through the body. Fats also play a very important 
part in regulating the level and types of cholesterol in the bloodstream, 
which in turn affect various hormones and general health.</p>

<p>A diet deficient in fat will result in itchy, flaky skin and other 
problems, but a diet that deficient takes real determination to achieve 
since fats are found not only in animal products but in grains, nuts, 
beans and just about anything else considered edible.</p>

<p>A diet with too much fat, and especially too much of the wrong kind of 
fat, presents a high risk of heart attack, stroke, obesity, diabetes and 
certain types of cancer. It may also  make you appear ugly and undesirable 
to many people, possibly resulting in social, employment and emotional 
problems. On the flip side, "supermodel thin" is pretty ugly and unhealthy 
too.</p>

<h2 id="chol">Fats <small>&amp;</small> Cholesterol</h2>

<p>Cholesterol is essential for health and key to production of certain 
hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, and in production of bile 
essential for digestion. Cholesterol is a major component of your brain 
and essential for neurotransmitter function (<a href="oilshealth.html#O22"><b>O22</b></a>). 
</p>
<p>The two major varieties of Cholesterol are low density lipoprotein 
- LDL (often called "bad" cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein - 
HDL (often called "good" cholesterol). LDL tends to build up on the 
inside of arteries as "plaque", resulting in heart attacks and stroke, 
but this build up ins increasingly thought to be a symptom, not the 
base problem. The link between cholesterol and heart disease, which 
has been gospel, is now seriously in question</p>

<p>"Dietary cholesterol" is cholesterol consumed in food, and it only 
comes from animal foods. Most people are not particularly sensitive to 
the amount of dietary cholesterol they consume because nearly all their 
"blood cholesterol" is manufactured by the liver, but some people are 
sensitive to dietary cholesterol so it is included in nutritional 
labeling. Brain cholesterol is made entirely in the brain.</p> 

<p>The amount and type of fats consumed are thought by many medical 
researchers to affect both the level and type of cholesterol in the 
bloodstream. Since heart, arteries and brain are often considered 
important parts of the body, it follows that what type and quantity of 
fats you consume is important. Unfortunately, this is where agreement 
among experts breaks down completely.</p>

<h2 id="type">Types of Fats</h2>

<p>Fats are a mixture of "fatty acids", which fall into several categories, 
each of which has an impact on cholesterol and general health. The 
nature of, and healthfulness of a particular fat or oil depends on the 
proportion among the fatty acids it is composed of. Our 
<a href="oilchart.html"><b>Oil Composition Chart</b></a> provides an overview 
of the composition of many common oils.
<ul>
<li><b>Saturated Fats</b> come primarily from animal sources, including butter 
and milk. Vegetable oils all have some saturated fats but way less than 
animals - except coconut and palm oil which have levels way higher than 
animal fats - more on that later. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature 
(butter, lard, etc), important for baked goods, and are highly resistant to 
rancidity. "Accepted Medical Knowledge" has held them to be the "great evil" 
that increases levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood, but this 
"knowledge" appears to be starting to crumble. Recent research has even shown 
that saturated fats may protect the heart from the ravages of Canola Oil.
<p></p></li>
<li><b>Monounsaturated Fats</b> (Omega-9) are found primarily in vegetable oils. 
particularly in olive oil and canola oil. They are liquid at room temperature, 
are reasonably resistant to rancidity, and are thought to reduce levels of 
LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood, and may even help remove some cholesterol 
deposits from the arteries. Some studies have shown a reduction in colon 
cancer. All sides currently seem to agree that monounsaturated fats are a 
"good thing" though some factions hold they should not be used at frying 
temperatures.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Polyunsaturated Fats</b> (Omega-6) are also found primarily in 
vegetable oils, particularly sunflower, cottonseed, and soy oils. These 
fats may affect cholesterol similarly to monounsaturates, but these oils 
go rancid very easily. A major controversy is whether rancidity resulting 
from cooking temperatures is a serious cancer risk (all agree rancidity 
is very bad). I suspect polyunsaturated fats will increasingly fall from favor.

<p>Opinion is shifting to hold that the fat intake of Americans has 
shifted way too far in favor of polyunsaturated fats, and that this 
is a very bad thing. Some research even holds that, with a shortage of 
any other fats, the body is building cell walls, notably skin cells, 
using weaker polyunsaturated fats rather than the strong saturated 
fats they are supposed to use. This results in vulnerability to 
disease, including cancers.</p>

<p><b>Omega-3</b> is also a polyunsaturated fat, but quite different from 
Omega-6 in its reputed positive effect on health. Omega-3 is found in its 
most useful form in oils from fish and crustaceans. The version in 
vegetable oils, particularly canola oil, flaxseed oil and soy oil, is a 
different form and may not be as effective. Omega-3 fatty acids are 
essential to growth, reproductive system and vision and may help prevent 
cancer. On the other hand, they have rancidity problems, and some recent 
research suggests Omega-3 may be damaging to the heart if not 
accompanied by sufficient saturated fats (<a href="oilshealth.html#O20"><b>O20</b></a>).
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Trans Fats</b> are found in small amounts in animal fats, but those 
differ from manufactured versions. Trans fats are particularly present in 
partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as margarine, vegetable 
shortening and food processing ingredients. After being promoted as a 
"healthier alternative" to animal fats for about 70 years or so, they have 
recently become the "Greater Evil", now considered the very worst kind of 
fats. They have been found not only to increase LDL (bad) cholesterol, but 
to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol, promote type 2 diabetes, cause brain 
damage and other ills, and to block conversion of vegetable Omega-3 into 
the usable (fish oil) types. All sides now agree trans fats are bad, but 
don't agree on just how bad.<p></p></li>

<li id="inter"><b>Interesterified Fats:</b> &nbsp; Under intense 
pressure to eliminate Trans Fats the food processing and fast food 
industries are turning to these alternate industrially modified fats. 
They offer similar benefits (from their point of view) to Trans Fats and 
can be made cheaply. Unfortunately they seem to have all the bad health 
impacts of trans fats, <u>plus</u> increasing blood sugar levels. Not 
good  (<a href="oilshealth.html#O19"><b>O19</b></a>, <a href="oilshealth.html#O21"><b>O21</b></a>), 
and more study is called for.</ul>


<h2 id="saturate">The Saturated Fat Controversy</h2>

<p>"<b>Accepted Medical Knowledge</b>" has held these things to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Saturated fat</b> is very bad so avoid all animal fats and 
  tropical oils (coconut, palm, palm kernel). These cause buildup of LDL 
  (bad) cholesterol in the blood and clog the arteries.</li>
<li><b>Monounsaturated fats</b> are good and should account for the 
  majority of your fat consumption.</li>
<li><b>Polyunsaturated fats</b> are probably as good for you as 
  monounsaturated fats.</li>
<li><b>Trans fats</b> are probably not a whole lot worse than saturated 
  fats,</li>
<li><b>Total Fat</b> consumption should be reduced to less than 30% of 
  the daily caloric intake.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these points have lately become highly controversial, as they 
are not upheld by demographics or much recent research. This viewpoint 
is, however, strongly promoted by the American Heart Association and has 
the full financial backing of the giant grain and seed oil traders 
(Cargill Inc.,  ADM Inc. etc.) and the food processing industry. All of 
them are happy to finance as much "research" and political pressure as 
needed to back these health claims in their advertising.</p>

<p>One side effect of the industry campaign against saturated fats is a 
spectacular increase in trans fats consumed in the American diet - 
fats that all sides now agree are very bad for you. No safe limits have 
been established but, the US FDA (United States Food and Drug 
Administration) says to consume "as little as possible".</p>

<p>This doctrine, sometimes called the "Lipid Hypothesis", despite its 
popularity and support even from the U.S. Congress (as if Congress 
critters knew anything about nutrition), has some spectacular 
weaknesses which threaten to expose it all as hocum and snake oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the 1920s Americans practically lived on lard and other animal 
  fats (even margarine was made from animal fats in those days). Vegetable 
  oils were little used, but despite all this, congestive heart disease 
  and cancer were little seen.</li>
<li>Various ethnic groups around the world eat diets extremely high in 
  animal fats yet show low levels of heart disease.</li>
<li>Other cultures use coconut oil for all their cooking and every meal. 
  Coconut oil is way higher in saturated fats than even lard (92% vs. 44%) 
  yet these people show low rates of heart disease.</li>
<li>The once wildly popular Atkins diet totally violated the principles of 
  the "lipid hypothesis" yet dieters were not dropping like flies from 
  congestive heart disease, nor were they likely to show high blood 
  cholesterol levels.</li>
<li>Key studies upon which this "knowledge" is based have been shown to 
  be "bad science", irrelevant, badly misinterpreted, or all of the above 
  (<a href="oilshealth.html#O10"><b>O10</b></a>, <a href="oilshealth.html#O5"><b>O5</b></a>).</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Opponents of the accepted viewpoint have suggested a more persuasive 
case can be made that these diseases start to appear when a population 
adopts large quantities of refined carbohydrates such as sugar and white 
flour (also darlings of the grain traders and food processors) and large 
amounts of vegetable oils and shortenings.</p>

<p>In the United States, Crisco, the first partially hydrogenated 
vegetable shortening, was invented in 1911 and became popular, heavily 
promoted as a "healthier alternative" to lard, during the 1920s - about 
the same time heart disease and cancer started being significant killers. 
This is not to say Crisco was the cause or that there weren't other 
factors, but it certainly wasn't saturated fats causing the problem.</p>

<p>One group particularly vocal against the "accepted knowledge" has been 
the tropical oils partisans who maintain coconut oil is the most healthy 
cooking oil you can use even though it's about 92% saturated fat. Palm oil 
is lower in saturated fat and higher in monounsaturated fats with a composition 
profile very similar to lard and tallow.</p>

<p>The American Heart Association is dead set against tropical oils 
claiming their saturated fat will clog your arteries, but once again, 
ethnic populations making heavy and daily use of these oils show no 
arterial clogging, in fact quite the opposite. Further, the only formal 
research condemning coconut oil is invalid because it used 
<u>hydrogenated oils</u> 
(<b><a href="oilshealth.html#O12">O12</a></b>).</p>


<h2 id="trans">Trans Fats Bad! &nbsp; - &nbsp; No Longer Controversial</h2>

<p>Trans fats are a major component of "partially hydrogenated vegetable 
oil", an industrial product the aim of which is to convert liquid oils 
into fats that are solid at room temperature and resistant to rancidity 
just as saturated fats are. The American Heart Association spent decades 
promoting trans fats as a "safer" alternative to the natural fats we 
evolved with.</p>

<p>All sides of the fats controversy now agree that trans fats are bad for 
you (<a href="oilshealth.html#O4"><b>O4</b></a>). Just how bad depends on how much of 
your income depends on them. Apologists claim they are no more artery 
clogging than saturated fats. Others say they are far worse, pointing 
out that not only do they clog arteries faster, but also contribute 
strongly to other diseases, particularly diabetes and brain damage. A 
recent study found they contribute significantly to dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease 
(<a href="oilshealth.html#O23"><b>O23</b></a>).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, trans fats are not going away quickly because they are a 
darling of the fast food industry in particular, and the food processing 
industry in general, for good (to them) reasons.</p>

<p>Health advocates brought intense pressure against the fast food 
industry for its heavy use of beef fat, particularly for deep frying. 
Since beef fat is high in saturated fats the "accepted knowledge" of 
the time implicated it in killing tens of thousands of Americans 
every year.</p>

<p>Responding to this pressure, the fast food industry decided to move to 
the vegetable oils promoted by the do-gooders, but quickly found them 
unusable. Beef fat is very durable at high temperatures and resistant to 
rancidity. A fry tank of beef fat will work fine for nearly a month. 
Vegetable oils, especially those high in polyunsaturated fats, degrade 
quickly at high temperatures, becoming rancid, laden with toxins, and 
don't taste real good. You'd have to change the oil on practically a 
daily basis - totally unaffordable in the fast food industry.</p>

<p>The fast food solution was to use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, 
in other words, evil trans fats. These are so resistant to heat breakdown 
and rancidity a tank of fry oil can be run for as much as 40 days (with 
topping up) before it must be discarded.</p>

<p>Food processors favor trans fats for similar reasons. They provide 
baked goods and other products with an attractive texture, and they 
resist rancidity resulting in a long shelf life for the products - and 
you can claim "no saturated fats" on the label.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for both industries, the FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration) issued new rules requiring trans fats be included in 
labeling and in nutritional information sheets by 1 Jan 2006. This 
caused a scramble to find alternatives - some of which may be even 
worse than trans fats. In many cases they're turning to 
<u>Interesterafied Oils</u>. These unnatural industrial products seem 
to have all the problems of trans fats, plus raising blood sugar 
levels, but products using them can advertise "zero trans fats" 
(<a href="oilshealth.html#O19"><b>O19</b></a>, <a href="oilshealth.html#O21"><b>O21</b></a>).</p>

<p>Crisco, the original trans fat producer, has come up with a vegetable 
shortening formula using fully hydrogenated oils (hard as a hockey puck) 
whipped up with enough unhydrogenated oils to achieve an acceptable texture 
while maintaining a level of trans fats they are allowed to call "zero".</p>

<p>Of course fully hydrogenated oils are actually saturated fats, the 
very thing vegetable shortening was supposed to get you away from - and 
they are artificial saturated fats at that. Do not expect a big health 
campaign against these saturated fats because they are made from the 
vegetable oils the giant grain traders promote in their "heart healthy" 
advertising. There will be no industry sponsored "studies" to rile up 
the do-gooders against them.</p>

<h2 id="poly">Polyunsaturated Oils and Cancer</h2>

<p>Now here we have a raging controversy pitting the full wealth of the 
grain traders and food processors against vocal opponents.</p>

<p>All sides seem to be in agreement that monounsaturated fats are pretty 
safe, promote arterial health and may reduce risk of cancer, but 
monounsaturates dominate only in olive oil, canola oil and nut oils. 
Polyunsaturates dominate in all other vegetable oils. Canola oil is 
suspected of other evils (<a href="oilshealth.html#O17">O17</a>) and nut oils are expensive 
and have a low smoke point, so that pretty much leaves olive oil.</p>

<p>Polyunsaturated oils are far more vulnerable to rancidity, and the 
products of rancidity are often free radical carcinogens (promoting 
cancer). Opponents of the vegetable oil industry say polyunsaturates 
are so vulnerable to rancidity that the heat of cooking causes them to 
go rancid almost immediately. The vegetable oil industry, while 
admitting vulnerability to rancidity, says it doesn't happen in normal 
cooking usage, but these oils have been found completely unsuitable 
for restaurant deep fry use - they start to stink within a couple of 
hours of use.</p>

<p>While studies tend to show polyunsaturated fats promote (vs. cause) 
cancer growth (<a href="oilshealth.html#O6"><b>O6</b></a>. <a href="oilshealth.html#O7"><b>O7</b></a>), 
much more study needs to be done. Most of the studies so far have been small 
and on rats, but enough evidence is accumulating to take this point 
seriously.</p>

<p id="omega3">One thing that is showing up fairly strongly 
though is that one class of polyunsaturated oils, called <b>Omega-3 fatty 
acids</b> appears to suppress cancer. Omega-3 oils are found mainly in 
oily fish, crustaceans, flaxseed oil and canola oil 
(<a href="oilshealth.html#O8"><b>O8</b></a>) but the vegetable forms are different from 
the fish and crustacean forms and their effectiveness is in question - 
again more study is needed. Further, some research suggests Omega-3 
may be damaging to the heart if not accompanied by sufficient saturated 
fats (<a href="oilshealth.html#O20"><b>O20</b></a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are other problems with Omega-3 fats. They go 
rancid very quickly when heated. While raw canola oil may be high in 
Omega-3 fats (whether effective or not), the refining process uses high 
temperatures, and after de-odorizing (to remove products of rancidity) 
there may be almost no Omega-3 left in the product as bottled.</p>
