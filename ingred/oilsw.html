<span class=bg>The majority of cooking techniques we use depend on oil, 
either as a heat transfer medium, as a flavoring, or commonly both. 
Selection of an appropriate oil, the amount used and the temperature it 
is used at are all critical to success in cooking. There are also health 
and safety considerations to keep in mind.</span>

<h2 class=lrg id="select">Selecting Suitable Oils</h2>

<p>Even the most casual cook needs at least two oils: a high temperature 
oil (400&deg;F+) for deep frying, saut&eacute; and stir frying, and a 
flavorful oil like extra virgin olive oil for salads and low temperature 
cooking. If I wanted to minimize the number of oils I had on hand, I'd 
select Butter, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Pure Olive Oil (and dark 
Sesame for Oriental stuff - but not as a cooking oil). Actually, I 
usually have a half dozen oils on hand.</p>

<p>High heat destroys oils (polyunsaturates much faster than others) 
and the byproducts of breakdown don't taste good and are possibly 
carcinogenic. You can use a high temperature oil at low temperatures 
(sacrificing flavor) but never use an oil higher than its rated range. 
With flavorful oils, keep well away from the maximum or you will lose 
the flavor you paid extra for.</p>

<p><b>Health factors</b> are also a consideration, but intense controversy 
surrounds cooking fats and oils (see our 
<a href="oilshealth.html"><b>Oils, Fats and Health</b></a> page), 
because a lot of money at stake. The chart below serves the three leading 
theories including the "Anything in Moderation" 
theory which can select from either column. Currently the "Dissident" 
group is gaining favor and the "AHA" group is in decline, despite the 
vast amount of money poured in to support that side. Many top chefs are 
now comfortable returning to traditional fats and oils.</p>

<h2 class=lrg id="store">Storing Oils</h2>

<p>Most oils are highly perishable because unsaturated fats are subject 
to oxidation and rancidity. All contain significant amounts of unsaturated 
fats (with the notable exception of coconut oil which is darned near 
eternal). Those high in polyunsaturates are most vulnerable and should 
be used in less than 6 months of opening while monounsaturates (Olive Oil) 
will last a year properly stored.</p>

<p>Properly stored means in a tightly sealed glass jar or oil can in a 
cool dark place. You can store oils very much longer if you refrigerate 
them, but all (except Safflower Oil) will solidify to some extent, 
particularly Olive Oil. This is not damaging and left at room temperature 
for a while they'll re-liquify. I keep dark Sesame Oil in in the 
refrigerator, but the rest I use up fast enough to store at room 
temperature.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="method">Cooking Methods</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="saute">Saut&eacute;</h2>

<p>There is confusion here because a great many writers now use the 
word "saut&eacute;" for what would more properly be called stir frying, 
or "fry stirring" as used on Clovegarden as "stir fry" means something 
very specific to some people. Here we describe the original meaning 
of "saut&eacute;.</p>

<p>A small amount of oil is used at high temperature to quickly 
brown ingredients. Heat the pan moderately, add the oil and turn up the 
heat to bring the oil up to near its maximum temperature - but it should 
not smoke because that damages the oil. Then add the ingredients and 
leave to brown on one side. Make sure they have plenty of space and don't 
move them around. When done, turn over to brown the other side, again 
without moving (for vegetables you will have to move them around more).
</p>
<p>Saut&eacute;ing is a favorite technique for restaurant chefs because 
it can be very quick and requires only modest attention once you're good 
at it. Clearly though, saut&eacute;ing takes a bit more practice than 
most cooking methods since you have to get the heat and timing right 
by experience.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this searing does not "seal the meat" as so many sources 
state, it is of use only for flavor. Careful testing has shown the meat 
will lose the same amount of liquid in cooking as if it had not been 
seared.</p>

<p>Good oils to use are <b>Olive Pomace</b> and <b>Avocado</b>, but 
other oils and fats can be used within their temperature range.</p>

<p>Meats must be tender cuts or they will just toughen, Depending on the 
recipe they may be floured or not. If not, they should be dry and brushed 
lightly with oil to prevent sticking. If floured, they should be dried 
before coating. Meat should be cut thin enough to cook through (for thicker 
cuts, after saut&eacute;ing the saut&eacute; pan can be moved directly into 
a hot oven to finish cooking). Vegetables should be cut so they will all 
cook in the same time, hard vegetables small, soft vegetables larger (or 
you can cut them uniform and add in stages).</p>

<p>In some cases more ingredients may be added at the end of saut&eacute; 
and the pan may be "deglazed" (by wine or flamb&eacute; with brandy) to 
provide additional flavoring, or a sauce may be made.</p>

<p><img src="img/kp_fry03e.jpg" alt="Saut&eacute; Pans" class=mrg>
<h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; The straight sided covered pan we call a 
saut&eacute; pan is not the ideal device for saut&eacute;ing and would be 
more accurately called a "braising pan". The ideal device for 
saut&eacute;ing is a shallow pan with sloping sides and very good heat 
conducting properties (cast iron or aluminum core stainless or such). 
The more open shape allows steam to escape faster than in a straight 
sided pan.
<br class=cll>
<p></p>

<h2 id="braise">Braising &nbsp; - &nbsp; Stovetop <small>&amp;</small> Oven</h2>

<p>Here you start by frying the main ingredients in a small amount of 
oil, similar to saut&eacute; or stir fry. Ingredients may be added in 
the process, such as starting with onion, then adding meat, garlic and 
ginger while continuing to fry. Once you've reached the proper state of 
brownness, you add a small amount water or stock (and probably a few 
more ingredients), cover tightly and either simmer on the stovetop, or 
in a preheated oven until the ingredients are tender. The recipe is 
often finished up on the stovetop.</p>

<p>The most common oils are <b>Butter</b> and/or <b>Olive Oil</b>, Others 
can be used. Some people say to cut the Butter with some Olive Oil to 
raise the smoke point, but all this actually does is hide the fact that 
the butter is being damaged by excess heat. The main ingredients may be 
cubed, or may be put in whole and rotated now and then to brown on all 
sides.</p>

<p>For <b>Stovetop Braising,</b> after browning put in enough water or 
stock to come up about 1/3 of the depth of the ingredients. Cover tightly 
and bring to a simmer. Check the liquid occasionally and turn the 
ingredients for even cooking. The pot must never run dry. Meat is done 
when it's fork tender.</p>

<p>For <b>Oven Braising,</b> after the browning step, put in enough water 
or stock to come up about 1/4 of the depth of the ingredients. Cover 
tightly and place it in an oven preheated to between 325&deg;F/160&deg;C 
and 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. Meat is done when it's fork tender.</p>

<p>Whether braised on the stovetop or in the oven, many dishes end up back 
on the stovetop for finishing. The main ingredients are often removed and 
the remaining ingredients made into a sauce which then accompanies the 
main ingredients.</p>

<img src="img/kp_braiseset03e.jpg" alt="Braising Pans" class=mrg>
<h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; For stovetop or oven braising both Dutch ovens and 
covered saut&eacute; pans are used. The Dutch shown here is oval, which I 
prefer for fit to oblong things, but round ones work as well  Covered 
casseroles can also used if you're sure they're flameproof.
<br class=cll>
<p></p>


<h2 id="stew">Stewing</h2>

<p>Stewing is pretty much the same as <a href="oilsw.html#braise">Braising</a> 
except you put in enough water or stock to pretty much cover the 
ingredients. Again, it starts on the stovetop with browning, and 
generally ends on the stovetop with the finish seasoning, reduction 
or thickening, but the middle portion can be done either on the 
stovetop or in the oven.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="fry">Pan Frying</h2>

<p>Pan Frying is similar to saut&eacute; except more oil is likely used 
and the ingredients are moved and turned more often. Generally the 
ingredients are removed entirely from the frying pan when sufficiently 
browned and the oil does not become part of a sauce, but may be used to 
fry additional items.</p>

<p>Again, butter and olive oil are the most used oils, but many others 
including lard, duck fat, goose fat, and even chicken fat (especially 
if you're Jewish) are frequently used - unless you subscribe firmly 
to column 2 of the selection chart above.</p>

<p>
<img src="img/kp_skillet07e.jpg" alt="Iron Skillet" class=mrg>
<b>Equipment:</b> &nbsp; For pan frying, the best pan is a shallow heavy 
cast iron pan that has been well and properly seasoned. Some people select 
non-stick pans, but I'm a firm believer that all coatings become worn, 
torn, scratched, dissolved or burned away in short order - proper 
seasoning is a constantly renewable non-stick coating. Some others use 
non-stick for for the single purpose of frying scrambled eggs and avoid 
it otherwise.</p>

<p>Your beautiful and costly multiply stainless / aluminum / copper 
frying / saut&eacute; pans are not at all ideal for heavy frying. Stuff 
will tend to stick badly to the unseasoned surfaces and the pan will be 
very difficult to clean with baked on oil.  A well seasoned iron pan will 
fry beautifully and is supposed to have a thin coating of baked on oil - 
but don't let it form a crust which will eventually start flaking off 
into the food.</p>

<p>Again, non-stick is not ideal as the coating degrades and may become 
toxic if overheated. Most chefs detest non-stick, with one exception - 
many keep a non-stick pan for scrambled eggs.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="stir">Stir Fry</h2>

<p>Stir frying refers to an Asian technique generally executed in a wok, 
a wide shallow pan of spherical shape. This technique uses a small amount 
of oil at high temperatures to cook ingredients very quickly preserving 
flavor and texture. The oil may become part of the recipe if a sauce is 
made.</p>

<p>"Stir fry" is often used in the context of Western cooking simply 
because it's easier to say and write than "fry stirring". Oriental stir 
frying can be done in a saut&eacute; pan, but it will require more 
oil and it may be rather cramped for ingredients that wilt down during 
cooking - and you can't park ingredients up on the cooler sides as you 
can with a wok.</p>

<p>All in all, Western stoves are not ideal for woks. Round bottomed 
versions must be placed on a ring stand which may hold them too far from 
the flame, and the hottest part will be around the center not at the 
center. I strongly prefer wire stands to sheet metal rings, and with 
either I make cuts in them so they fit tight over the burner, with the 
wok closer to the flame.</p>

<p>Many stir fry recipes, especially where meat is involved, describe 
it in a way that simply can't happen on a home stove. A home stove just 
can't deliver the volume of heat (BTUs) a restaurant stove can, and can't 
instantly evaporate all the liquid exuded from the meat. In China, 
restaurants often heat the wok so hot that when they toss in the oil it 
bursts into flames reaching for the ceiling - not recommended for the 
average home kitchen.</p>

<p>The wok's native stove is a clay charcoal box with a round wok fitting 
hole at the top. These stoves are very hot and maximum heat is in the 
very center of the wok. Keeping this in mind, good results can still be 
achieved on a Western stove.</p>

<p>A high temperature oil of neutral flavor should be used. Preferred 
oils are <b>Olive Pomace</b>, Avocado, and <b>Peanut</b>. Because the 
frying time is very short and the oil will not be reused, you can 
choose an oil higher in polyunsaturates such as <b>Grapeseed</b>, 
<b>Sunflower</b> or <b>Safflower</b>. Actually, since my wok is seldom 
going to reach anywhere near Chinese restaurant temperatures, my usual 
stir fry oil is <b>Pure Olive Oil</b> (not Virgin).</p>

<p>Stir frying starts by heating the pan and poring in the required 
amount of oil (usually 1 to 2 Tablespoons). Spread it up the sides and 
bring it up to near smoking temperature over very high heat, or, if 
you don't have an infra-red surface thermometer, until you see the 
first wisp of smoke). Start adding ingredients per the recipe.</p>

<p>The key to successful stir frying is cutting and organization. Cut 
ingredients to uniform size and thin enough to cook through very quickly. 
All preparation must be done in advance because the process is too fast 
and needs too much attention to permit prep work. If you're having 
rice it should be completely cooked. Start the stir fry during the 
rice's 10 minute resting time.</p>

<p>Heat the oil very hot for meat (but never smoking which damages the 
oil) and moderately hot if starting with garlic, ginger and the like. A 
good strategy is to cook any meat first at high temperature and set it 
aside. Fry other ingredients at a more moderate temperature, then add 
the meat back in when about done. Keep in mind the wok must never be 
overloaded.</p>

<p>If meat is to be cut thin or shredded, it'll be easier if you sit it 
in the freezer for 20 minutes or so - enough to stiffen it a bit but not 
freeze it.  Start adding ingredients with aromatics (garlic, ginger, etc.) 
and then in order of cooking time. It takes a little practice to judge 
the timing. Ingredients should be tumbled very frequently to assure even 
cooking.</p>
 
<p>If some ingredients are done while others are not done yet, you can 
keep the done ones from getting overcooked by parking them up on the 
cooler sides of the wok. Many recipes call for a finish steaming or 
braising covered with a tight fitting wok lid (return any removed meat 
for this step) and/or making of a sauce just as with saut&eacute;. You 
can push ingredients up the sides and start a sauce in the bottom, then 
mix the ingredients back down into it.</p>

<p><img src="img/kp_wokset12e.jpg" alt="Wok Set" class=mrg>
<h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; Best is to use a wok, a shallow spherical pan 
which should be about 14 inches across, or at least 13 inches, for home 
use. To fit it on a Western burner you need a ring stand (I strongly 
prefer a wire stand as shown in the photo), and you need a wide shovel 
that fits the curve of the pan. For a carbon steel wok, a metal shovel 
is usually used, but for a multi-ply it should be wooden because the 
surface should not be marred or stuff will stick. You also should 
have a slotted spatula for lifting ingredients without taking too much 
oil or liquid, and a wire "Spider" (lower right corner in the photo, 
but it's handle isn't showing) for lifting things out of deep oil. A 
special fitted wok lid for finish steaming or braising is essential.


<h3>Carbon Steel Wok:</h3> &nbsp; Most preferred by hard core wok 
chefs is a heavy gauge bare carbon steel wok, seasoned well with oil. 
This is the kind of wok that responds most quickly to changes in stove 
temperature, providing maximum control. The 14 inch one I have was made 
by Atlas Metal Spinning in San Francisco and is of very fine quality 
with a long wooden handle. Unfortunately, Atlas no longer makes them. 
Most woks have loop handles which must be handled with pot holders 
or oven mitts.

<h3>Multi-Ply Stainless Wok:</h3> &nbsp; Despite having the Atlas, I 
do most of my routine stir frying in a 13 inch multi-ply Calphalon wok, 
for which I purchased a stainless lid from an Asian grocery. It is 
certainly not as responsive as my 14 inch Atlas but is more convenient 
because it is just a little smaller (though perfectly adequate for 
cooking for two or three), has a small flat area in the bottom so it 
doesn't need a ring stand, and it's very easy to clean.

<h3>Cast Iron Woks:</h3> &nbsp; These are extremely rare, though I have 
a Japanese one I inherited from a mad Russian (redundant, I know - there 
isn't any other kind). It is a bit heavy to work with and much less 
responsive than the muti-ply Calphalon, but it does fry evenly. Chinese 
Cast Iron Woks are not available in North America. They are so thin even 
a moderate blow will destroy them, but some Chinese wok chefs really like 
them (and always keep spares).

<h3>Chef's Pan:</h3> &nbsp; Another option, and now sometimes called a 
"Western Wok". This has a wide flat bottom, is fairly deep, and the sides 
curve up smoothly. Multi-ply is best. The downside of this pan is its 
relatively low sides and small diameter. With a regular Wok, you can 
toss in a huge pile of raw greens all at once and start wilting them, 
but the Chef's Pan doesn't have that much capacity. For many jobs it 
will require more oil than a round Wok.

<h3>Non-stick Woks:</h3> &nbsp; These are an abomination. They cannot 
handle the high temperatures without emitting toxic gasses, and they 
can't handle the abrasion they are likely to encounter.
<p></p>

<h3>Electric Woks:</h3> &nbsp; Horrid things - they don't get hot enough, 
and the heater element is well up from the center, making a hot ring up 
where it should start getting cooler, and the center is cool where it 
should be hottest.
<p></p>

<h3>Electric Stove:</h3> &nbsp; If you're stuck cooking with electricity 
(I shed a tear for you), you're better off using a <b>Chef's Pan</b> 
(see above) which will have good contact with the heating element. Because 
electric burners respond very slowly, expert wok cooks often keep a 
front burner very high and a back burner lower so they can shuffle the 
pan between the burners. If your electric stove is an induction range, 
the only practical choice is a Chef's Pan with a magnetic outer layer 
(most multi-ply pans have this). Heat responsiveness should be 
better than with conventinal heating elements.
<br class=cll>
<p></p>

<h2 id="deep:">Deep Frying</h2> 

<p>For deep frying, heat your oil very hot (but never hotter than it's 
rated for). Take care not to overload it with ingredients so the 
temperature stays very high. If it falls too low the items fried will 
become soggy with oil.</p>

<p>Take particular care with meat that has been previously frozen because 
it exudes a lot of water quickly. Meat that has not been frozen exudes 
just as much, but more slowly. Meat should be thoroughly drained and 
firmly patted dry with paper towels, then fry in small batches.</p>

<p>Frying in small batches will take no longer than frying one big batch, 
but the results will be much better. In particular meat will be browned 
before it dries out inside.</p>

<p>In general, 350&deg;F/175&deg;C is a good starting point for most 
ingredients, but if you're using a 350&deg;F fat like lard, keep it a 
bit lower. For some ingredients I find 410&deg;F/210&deg;C works better 
You should be applying enough heat that the oil comes back to maximum 
temperature by the time the current batch is fully done.</p> 

<p>For French fried potatoes, the experts recommend "blanching" by 
frying at 350&deg;F/175&deg;C until cooked through. When ready to 
serve do a final browning fry at 365&deg;F/185&deg;C.</p>
<p>For donuts and similar fried bread items a fat solid at room 
temperature is highly preferred so they don't drip oil all over 
everything. Lard and tallow are best, but "Zero trans fat" vegetable 
shortenings are usable.</p>
<p>
<img src="img/kp_kadhai02k.jpg" alt="Kadhai" class=mrg>
<img src="img/kp_deepfry07e.jpg" alt="Deep Fry Set" class=mrg>

<h3>Equipment</h3>: &nbsp; In my  experience, the Indian <i>kadhai</i> 
(left photo) is the ideal deep fry vessel for home use, needing far less 
oil than other devices and minimizing messy splatter. Its spherical shape 
has a shorter radius than the Asian wok, and higher sides. These same 
high sides make the kadhai less suitable for Asian stir fry because you 
can't park stuff up on the sides. The kadhai will need a ring stand 
(see above under wok) and a second ring stand so you can move a hot 
kadhai off the stove onto the kitchen floor (or some other surface) 
when done frying.

<p>The European deep fry pot and basket (right photo) also work well - 
for frying, but you're going need <u>a</u> <u>lot</u> <u>more</u> 
<u>oil</u>, and have <u>a</u> <u>lot</u> <u>more</u> <u>splatter</u> 
to clean-up. Your stove will be dripping. Do clean up right away 
because oil starts turning to varnish immediately and will be a lot 
harder to clean up in a day or two.</p>

<p>Of course there are now electric deep fry units, but they get rather 
mixed reviews so do your research before buying one. Like the European 
deep fry pot They do take a whole of oil, but splatter is not such a 
problem.</p>

<p><b>Reusing Deep Fry Oil</b> is permissible, within limits <u>IF</u> it 
is a very durable oil. Olive-Pomace and Avocado oils are best on the 
vegetable side, Beef tallow on the animal side. The oil must not have 
been overheated or otherwise abused, and must be filtered through a paper 
towel and stored carefully. See the "Oxi" column in our 
<a href="oilchart.html"><b>Smoke Point &amp; Composition</b></a> chart 
for durability. The lower the number the more durable the oil or fat.</p>

<p>Most common vegetable oils have very high oxidation numbers which 
means they aren't good for deep frying and quickly suffer heat rancidity 
(possibly carcinogenic). This is why the fast food industry, hounded by 
do-gooders to stop using beef tallow (safe and very durable) rejected 
them, switching to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (Trans Fats) 
which are similarly durable - but they are now considered far more 
harmful than the beef tallow they replaced. Score yet another "Fail" 
for the do-gooders.</p>

<p>When reusing oil, don't use oil fish was fried in to fry anything 
else because it will have a strong fish flavor. In restaurants, oil for 
potatoes is kept separate, but for the limited reuse in a home kitchen 
I don't consider this at all necessary. My rule is to use durable oil 
and no more than 4 times over the period of a month, discarding it when 
either limit has been reached, or if it has darkened substantially.</p>

<p>To store oil for reuse, let it be hot long enough after removing 
ingredients to make sure it has no moisture (there should be no bubbling 
or popping. Filter it through a white paper towel set in a wire strainer 
to remove all food particles (you may need several towels if debris in 
the oil clogs them). Store in a clean tightly sealed glass jar.

<h2 id="roast">Roasting</h2>

<p>Roasting usually refers to cooking birds and large pieces of meat in 
an oven at between 350&deg;F and 400&deg;F. The main source of oils is 
the fat contained in the bird or meat, but oil, usually <b>Butter</b> 
but sometimes <b>Lard</b>, <b>Bacon Fat</b> or <b>Olive Oil</b> may be 
brushed on, usually at the beginning or after turning.</p>

<p>Large vegetables such as squash and eggplants may also be oven roasted, 
generally in a shallow pan or on a grill. If cut, they will be brushed 
with butter or oil.Roasting is now also used to cook small cut vegetables 
that were formerly fried, particularly potatoes, with little oil or fat. 
First they are cut to size, then tumbled with oil to coat, and roasted 
on a baking sheet in the oven. Note: if you grease the pan with lard or 
tallow rather than vegetable oil it will be <u>much</u> easier to clean.
</p>

<p>For larger cuts, 3/8 inch or so of water may be placed in the pan to 
cook the potatoes, but all will be evaporated by time roasting is done. 
Temperatures are not that hot so moderate temperature oils can be used.
</p>

<p>Sometimes strips of bacon or lard are draped over the meat and the fat 
that renders from them keeps the meat coated and moist. Once fat starts 
to render from the meat itself it may be used for basting (brushing or 
dripping) the meat itself. Always follow the instructions in the recipe 
unless you have a very good reason not to.</p>

<img src="img/kp_roast02e.jpg" alt="Roasting Pan" class=mrg>
<h3>Equipment:</h3> For large birds and meat roasts a special roasting 
pan is used, a shallow pan which is fitted with either a "V" rack or 
a flat rack in it to keep the item roasted above the rendered fat and 
juices (and possible vegetables). Deep, covered roasting pans are also 
used, although these are somewhat out of style right now. A good meat 
thermometer with a long probe is a must so you can measure the 
temperature inside the roast to see if it's safely done. Even better 
is one with a cable so the probe can be left in the meat while it 
roasts in the oven with the display continuously visible.
<br class=cll>
<p></p>

<h2 id="bake">Baking</h2>

<p>There are two basic categories of baking: baking dough products like 
breads, cookies, cakes, pie crusts and the like, and baking casseroles 
(known as "hot dish" in the U.S. Midwest). Baking casseroles may involve 
no more oil than a rubbing of butter on the inside of the casserole dish 
to minimize sticking, and perhaps some oily cheese on top. On the other 
hand, some ingredients may be tumbled with oil before being added to the 
casserole, and others may be fried on the stove top before being 
included.</p>

<p>Baking breads, cookies, cakes, pie crusts and similar items always 
involves fats, generally fats solid at room temperature called 
"shortening", to provide a pleasant texture when cooled. Your choices 
here are generally <b>Lard</b>, <b>Butter</b> and <b>Vegetable 
Shortenings</b> (though some people have successfully (for certain 
values of success) used oils for some baking). For flavor and texture 
<a href="oils.html#lard">Lard</a> is considered best, preferably 
"leaf lard" from around the kidneys if you can get it.</p>

<p>People trying to avoid saturated fats turned to vegetable shortening 
and ended up with a <a href="oilshealth.html#trans">Trans Fats</a> 
problem that is a lot worse. "Zero trans fats" vegetable shortenings are 
now available, but are, of course, high in artificial (fully hydrogenated) 
saturated fats - they're vegetable saturated fats though, which makes 
some people (especially people at Cargill and ADM) feel better about 
them.</p>

<p>Baking dough products is highly critical in measurement, ingredients, 
temperature and timing, so follow the recipe with exacting care and use a 
timer with a loud alarm if you're likely to get distracted. Writers 
expert in baking want to specify recipes in weight rather than volume, 
which would be much more accurate, but cookbook publishers demand the 
traditional measures. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="salad">Dressing Salads</h2>

<p>Salads is where to use those "virgin", "cold pressed" or "unrefined" 
oils that are high in flavor but have a smoke point too low for frying. 
The run-away favorite here is Extra Virgin Olive Oil - superb flavor and 
healthy composition both.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of olive oil is that it solidifies in the 
refrigerator because it is low in polyunsaturated fats. This does no 
damage, just take your dressing out of the fridge 20 minutes before you 
need it.<p>

<p>Commercial salad dressings favor Safflower Oil because it is so 
high in polyunsaturated fats it's still liquid in the refrigerator. 
This sacrifices flavor compared to Olive, so they add more flavoring 
ingredients to make up for that. Some theories hold that 
polyunsaturates aren't good for you but at low salad temperatures 
the risk is a lot less.</p>

<p>When making salads, you should spin the ingredients dry and then coat 
with oil before you add vinegar. Oil will not properly coat ingredients 
that are wet with water or vinegar. In any case, don't apply dressing 
until you're about ready to serve or the salad will wilt.</p>

<p><img src="img/ke_sspin02k.jpg" alt="Salad Spinner" class=mrg>
<h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; 
You really need a salad spinner to get salad greens dry enough for the 
oil to coat properly. The French wire basket on a chain and the French 
wire basket with a toy top pump action are absolutely worthless (and may 
be extinct). Many plastic spinners are made that work pretty well, most 
with a crank action, but if you've got your wits about you you'll get an 
Oxo (illustrated). You also need a couple jars or bottles to shake 
dressings up in.

<h2 class=lrg id="safe">Safety</h2>

<p><img src="img/connie05c.jpg" alt="Melted Aluminum" class=mrg>
Cooking with oil at high temperature is dangerous and requires close 
attention. Connie's brand new stove was a lot hotter than her old one, 
and she turned her back on a pot of oil heating for deep frying. This 
splash of aluminum (once a sliding door) is all that remains of Connie's 
luxury home.</p>

<p>Much more serious is the possibility of severe personal injury from 
spilled oil or oil that splatters from contact with water. Oils are 
essential, but so is care.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li>Do <b>not</b> overheat oils. When an oil is at its smoke point it's 
also not far from its flash point, and an oil fire is very serious and 
difficult to extinguish. <b>NEVER EVER</b> attempt to put out an oil fire 
with water, you'll have flaming oil splattered far and wide and probably 
on you. Slide a lid over it or smother it with a cushion. In the oven, 
keep the oven closed and turn off the heat.</li>
<li>When adding ingredients to hot oil make sure they're as dry as 
possible to avoid splattering.</li>
<li>Never put oil in a wet pan, even with a few droplets. They'll explode 
while heating, splashing hot oil about.</li>
<li>Use a cooking vessel that's large enough. Too large is seldom a 
problem, but too small is disastrous.</li>
<li>Keep everything clean. Oil and grease buildups, oven or stovetop, 
can catch fire and be hard to extinguish. Further, cleaning up oil 
immediately is far easier than cleaning it up later when it's turned 
to varnish (a mater of a day or two with some oils).</li>
<li>Keep a fire extinguisher or two handy but not too near the stove.  
Connie had a brand new industrial size fire extinguisher, but it was 
mounted too close to the stove and she couldn't get to it.</li>
<li>Turn pot handles in on the stove to prevent accidents, especially 
if you have children who could grab a handle and spill hot oil all over 
themselves.</li>
<li>When setting cookware aside to cool, always leave a potholder on top 
to remind that it is very hot.</li>
<li>Wear sensible clothes, being particularly mindful of sleeves that 
could snag cookware or otherwise get into trouble. Clothing can protect 
you from small splashed droplets, but for a serious splash you're better 
off naked because fabric will hold a volume of hot oil until you are 
cooked.</li>
<li>If you burn something, don't quench it with water until it has had 
time to cool. Cold water into a hot pan can splash hot oil, scald with 
steam, and often damage the pan. If you can, move it to a metal, tile or 
concrete surface which will help cool it quickly, but not your cutting 
board which it'll burn a ring into (or melt if plastic).</li>
<li>Do not use tired oil or oil that has been damaged by heat. It isn't 
good for you.</li>
</ul>
