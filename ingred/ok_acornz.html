[Dotorimuk (Korea)]
<p>
Acorn Jelly is a popular ingredient in Korea. The acorns need to be 
gathered, shelled, and ground to paste. The starch is separated from the 
fiber by settling. Then the starch is soaked in several changes of water 
until the bitter tannins and toxins have been leached out. It is then 
dried and ground to flour for storage and use. This is pretty much the 
same procedure used by American Indians in California.</p>
<p>The dried flour (Dotori Mukgaru) is mixed with some water and salt, 
and brought to a simmer, stirring constantly, to make a porridge. The 
porridge is poured into molds and refrigerated to make the jelly. The 
powder can be found in Korean markets, but the markets often have already 
made acorn jelly sold in blocks, often made by the store. The photo 
example was 4-1/4 inches square (at the top edge) by 2 inches thick and 
weighed 1-1/2 pounds. It is shown bottom side up. It was purchased from 
a Korean market in Los Angeles for 2015 US $2.99 per pound. In Korea, 
this jelly is also made into noodles, but to a much lesser extent.</p>

<p>A major use for this jelly is in making salads, called Dotorimuk 
Muchim, It is also used as a snack (plain), appetizer (seasoned), and 
in soups.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Once made, the jelly requires no cooking. 
For salads and appetizers, it is just sliced up and seasoned. For 
soups it is often sliced into long narrow strips, which are placed over 
rice in a bowl. The hot broth is then poured over.</p>
