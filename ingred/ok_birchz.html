<h1>Birch</h1>
<br><img src="img/ok_birchp01g.jpg" alt="Birch Leaves and Catkins on tree" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Betula</i> of Family <i>Betulaceae</i>:  North America:  
<i>Betula lenta</i> (Black Birch): <i>Betula papyrifera</i> (Paper Birch): 
<i>Betula neoalaskana</i> (Alaska Birch): <i>Betula fontinalis</i> 
(Red Birch) &nbsp; | &nbsp; Eurasia: <i>Betula alba</i> (White Birch): 
<i>Betula pendula</i> (Silver Birch)]
<p>
These medium size trees are all cool weather Northern Hemisphere plants 
that have been of great importance to humans about as long as there have 
been humans in the cooler Northern Hemisphere. In cultivation, they can 
survive as far south as Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>The photo to the left is of <i>B. pendula</i>, showing leaves and 
catkins. Note that the product from the Philippines called "Birch Flower" 
is not actually birch, though it resembles birch catkins. It is from a 
member of the Mulberry family,

<h2>Birch Sap</h2>
<br><img src="img/ok_birchs02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Birch Sap" class=mrg>
Birch Sap is tapped from the tree similarly to how Maple Sap is tapped, 
but more delicately, because the tree is easily damaged. It is slightly 
cloudy and slightly sweet. Fresh sap is extremely perishable and will 
keep only a few days even refrigerated. Commercially, it is preserved 
by some means: pasteurization, sugar (3 g per 100 ml), freezing, etc. 
Pasteurization reduces the Vitamin C content, but other nutrients are 
not affected. The sap is collected only in the early spring, for about 
1 month before leaves sprout. Later it will be bitter.
<p>Birch Syrup also has medicinal and cosmetic uses throughout its 
range. It is a significant source of Vitamin C and B vitamins, as well 
as minerals and antioxidants. The photo specimen, purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland), for 2019 US $2.29 per 
liter. Natural Birch Sap, Sugar, Citric Acid, product of Ukraine. It 
needs to be refrigerated after opening and consumed within 3 days.

<h2>Birch Vodka</h2>
<br><img src="img/ok_birchv02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Birch Vodka" class=mrg>
The photo specimen, Nemiroff Birch Special Vodka, is a very good quality 
vodka from Ukraine, lightly flavored with Birch Sap. Birch flavored vodka 
is much favored in the region. It was purchased from a large multi-ethnic 
market in Los Angeles (Glendale), but is widely available, as are other 
Birch Vodkas from Ukraine, Russia, and other cold weather regions. There 
was one from Alaska Distillery, made with Birch Syrup, giving it an amber 
color, but that distillery has closed. It's successor, Alaskan Spirits 
Distillery does not yet produce a Birch Vodka (2018).

<h2>Birch Beer</h2> 
<br><img src="img/bv_birchb02s.jpg" alt="Glass of Birch Beer" class=mrg>
This is made mainly in the Northeast United States, and in 
Newfoundland, Canada. It is normally a non alcoholic. carbonated "soft 
drink", but alcoholic versions can be made. A center of production in 
the US is by the Pennsylvania Dutch. It may be flavored with extracts 
of Birch Bark or the flavors may be from distilling Birch Sap to get 
Birch Oil, and it may be made with various degrees of "authenticity".  
It has also been produced by directly fermenting a mix of Birch Sap, 
Sugar and yeast - which will produce a mildly alcoholic beverage.

<h2>Birch Syrup</h2>
<br><img src="img/ok_birchy01s.jpg" alt="Glass of Birch Syrup" class=mrg>
This is a very expensive syrup. It takes 100 to 150 liters of birch 
sap to make 1 liter of syrup - about twice as much as for maple syrup. 
Alaska Birch takes the most (130 to 150 liters) because its sap is 
thinner than the others. Birch Syrup is often made using reverse osmosis 
and evaporators to remove water rather than boiling it down like maple 
syrup, as it burns much more easily than maple sap. It is a fairly light 
syrup, with a taste described as "more minerally" than Maple Syrup. 
Major production regions are Russia, Canada, Alaska, Belerus, Ukraine 
and Scandinavia. The photo specimen was made in Vermont, U.S. and 
purchased for 2019 US $27.81 for 8 ounces (236 ml) with free shipping.

<h2>Birch Bark</h2>
<br><img src="img/ok_birchb01h.jpg" alt="Large Shard of Birch Bark" class=mrg>
Birch Bark has been used directly for food only during times of famine, 
when it has been ground to make "Birch Bread". It is also used to 
extract flavors, especially a wintergreen flavor, and others used to 
flavor beverages. It has also had many other uses, such as canoes in 
North America and the traditional shoes in Finland, and writing surfaces 
in ancient times.  It has also been used as roofing shingles, where it 
is very resistant to decay.

<h2>Birch Twigs</h2>
<br><img src="img/ok_bircht01h.jpg" alt="Bundles of Birch Twigs" class=mrg>
In Finland, bundles of birch twigs are used in the sauna for self 
flagilation. Those in the photo were for sale as decorative accents, 
but I'm sure they would serve.
