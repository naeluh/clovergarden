[genus <i>Castanea</i>, various species]
<p>
   This common nut is notable for being starchy rather than oily, so 
   it is used quite differently from other nuts. These nuts were a major food 
   item in parts of Europe, particularly in Spain, but in the late 1700s 
   blight wiped out vast chestnut forests resulting in famine. While they 
   have been largely replaced by potatoes for general sustenance, many 
   recipes still call for them.</p>
   <p>The American Chestnut, which once dominated our deciduous forests, was 
   almost totally wiped out in the early 1900s by blight from Asia.  Nearly 
   all chestnuts sold in North America are now imported from Europe, China 
   or Korea. Some American grown nuts are sold here in California, but they 
   are currently from trees of the Chinese variety.</p>
   <p>Efforts to breed an American variety with Asian resistance to the 
   blight are said near success. When they are available they will be planted 
   heavily in California, which produces more nuts than practically any other 
   country - but you knew that.</p> 
   <p>The photo shows smaller Korean chestnuts on the left and bottom, with 
   American grown Chinese chestnuts in the upper right. These larger nuts are 
   also grown in Korea, and range up to 1-7/8 inches across and 7/8 ounce. 
   The main difference I found is the smaller nuts were fairly 
   easy to peel, and the larger ones very difficult, but, unfortunately, many 
   of the smaller nuts were moldy.  The nut at the lower right is partially 
   peeled, showing the endocarp or inner shell, which is the main peeling 
   problem.</p>

Most chestnuts sold in the western U.S. are a Chinese variety that is 
much more resistant to chestnut blight than American or European 
varieties. These are imported from China, the world's largest chestnut 
grower, and Korea. In the Eastern U.S. many of the chestnuts available 
are imported from Europe. The Chinese variety is the same size as the 
European and a bit bigger than the currently unavailable American 
variety, but is not as sweet as the European.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in California we get bins full of Chinese 
and Korean chestnuts starting in October - I presume timing in the East 
is similar. Peeled European chestnuts put up in syrup can be found in 
some gourmet outlets at unacceptable prices. Peeled Asian chestnuts are 
available, both dried and frozen, in markets serving Chinese and Korean 
communities.<p></p>

<h3>Peeling:</h3> &nbsp; This is the major problem with chestnuts - they 
are difficult, sometimes nearly impossible, to peel. The Internet abounds 
with instructions on how to peel them by oven roasting, fire roasting or 
boiling. All these methods work equally well on the Chinese chestnuts we 
get here - not at all. Perhaps they work on European chestnuts, I don't 
know, we don't have those here.
<p>The outer shell (exocarp) is not the problem. It's the endocarp, or 
inner shell, which adheres hard to the nut meat that's difficult to 
remove. Not only is the endocarp difficult to remove at best, as soon as 
the nut cools enough to hold without pain, it starts to stick down again. 
Instructions that say the nut meat will "practically fall out" are 
laughable.</p>

<p>You have to have the nuts at a high temperature for sufficient time to 
loosen the endocarp, and by time it's loosened, the nut meat has become 
crumbly. The nut, rather than peeling, falls into fragments - with 
endocarp tightly adhering to most of the fragments.</p>

<p>Here is the only way I've found that works well enough to be useful. 
The theory of this method is that the outer surface of the nut becomes 
hot enough long enough for the endocarp to loosen, but the center was 
so cold it isn't yet hot enough to become crumbly. The nut holds together 
well enough to peel. The core temperature does have to be high enough so 
the nut doesn't cool too fast from the inside out. In other words, timing 
is <u>critical</u>.</p>

<h3>Warning:</h3> &nbsp; I developed this method in 2010 with some 
American grown Chinese chestnuts - even then it worked a lot better with 
the smaller Korean chestnuts. In 2014 I tried again with a new batch of 
Chinese chestnuts, but apparently they'd been "improved", because they 
were impossible to peel with this or any other method - all I got was 
sore fingers. I have declared them unpeelable, and just buy pre-peeled 
frozen chestnuts at the Asian markets. Commercially they probably use 
machines and chemicals, such as lye, to peel chestnuts.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Score nuts just through the outer shell (as all instructions tell you to 
  do). My prep knife has an extremely sharp, rigid point, so I hold the nut 
  to my cutting board, scar side down, with my left hand. With the right I 
  set the heel of the blade on the cutting board and bring the tip down across 
  the flat side of the nut. Special chestnut scoring knives are available on 
  the Internet (they look like tiny linoleum knives).</li>
<li>Freeze them solid in the freezer compartment, preferably overnight to 
  be sure.</li>
<li>Bring a <u>large</u> pot of water to a high boil over your hottest 
  burner (large so the temperature drop is limited when adding nuts).</li>
<li>Working with <u>less than 1 pound at a time</u> pour frozen nuts into 
  the boiling water. Keep over highest flame. For small nuts 8 minutes, 
  for large nuts maybe 10 minutes. Scoop them out of the water into a 
  bowl all at once. <u>Keep the water at a boil</u>.</li>
<li>Start peeling as quickly as you can hold the nuts (this is best done 
  by someone with hands accustomed to hard work, thus tough skin and 
  strong fingernails). As soon as they cool enough to be comfortable to 
  handle, the endocarp will start sticking down and be difficult to peel.
  </li> 
<li>Toss one nut back in the boiling water and give it a minute to get 
  hot. Scoop it out and toss in another. Chill the hot nut under cold 
  running water for 1/2 second, just enough so you can handle it. Peel 
  as fast as you can. Repeat.</li>
<li>If you see any sign of mold (blue-green spots) or rot (black spots) 
  while peeling, discard immediately and go to the next nut. You can 
  often smell mold before you see it.</li>
<li>When all are done, it's time to boil up the next batch.</li>
<li>When all the nuts are peeled, they still will be less than fully 
  cooked, so give them another 10 minutes in boiling water or cook fully 
  by some other method.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; 11-1/4 ounces of large Chinese chestnuts, with no 
loss from mold, yielded 7-7/8 ounces peeled edible (70%).</p>
