<h1>Hazelnut / Filbert</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/ok_hazelnut06g.jpg" alt="Hazelnuts, whole, opened, and in husks" class=mrg>
[family <i>Betulaceae</i>: <i>Corylus avellana</i> (Cobnut, Common Hazel) 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; Corylus maxima (Filbert) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Corylus 
heterophylla</i> (Asian Hazel)]
<p>
Hazelnut species are found in cool temperate climates through most of 
the northern hemisphere and all produce edible nuts but only the ones 
listed above are in significant commercial production, having much 
larger nuts than other species. <i>C. avellana</i> is native to almost 
all of Europe and deep into western Asia. It has been widely introduced 
in North America. <i>C. maxima</i> is native to southeastern Europe and 
northern Anatolia. What's the difference? The leafy cover of filberts 
is much longer than the nut, tighter around the nut, and is reddish in 
color. The largest producer of hazelnuts, by far, is Turkey, mostly from 
Ordu on the northern coast. Italy is a distant second. The largest U.S. 
producer is Oregon state, but recent large plantings in California are 
coming on-line.</p>

<p><i>C. hetrophylla</i> is native to central and northern China, 
southeastern Siberia, Korea and Japan. It is closely related to 
<i>C. avellana</i> and produces very similar nuts.</p>

<p>The photo specimens of <i>C. avellana</i> include shelled nuts 
(front), nuts in shell (middle) and nuts still in the leafy husks 
(involucres). Those in the husks are a rather elongated variety 
compared to the other shelled specimens and were probably grown in 
California.</p>

<p>Hazelnuts can be eaten raw or roasted. Roasted ones are featured in 
most cocktail nut mixes, along with peanuts, cashews, and possibly Brazil 
nuts (none of which are nuts, technically). In addition, Hazelnuts are 
often included as a flavoring thickener in the cuisines of their native 
regions.</p>
