<h1>Nut Trees</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Order <i>Fagales</i> includes most of the nut trees that fill 
our snack bowls with tasty morsels. Many are of great economic importance 
not only for nuts but also for hardwood timber. Some nuts, particularly 
<a href="ok_oaks.html#acorn">Acorns</a> have been very important to human survival 
since prehistoric times. Most <i>Fagales</i> are native to the northern 
hemisphere. The few families native to the Southern Hemisphere produce 
some highly desirable timber, but no nuts.

<h2>Bayberry Family</h2> 
<p>
[Wax-myrtle, Bay-rum tree, Candleberry, Sweet Gale, <i>Myricaceae</i>] 
&nbsp; A small family of waxy aromatic shrubs with three genera, two 
of which (<i>Comptonia</i> and <i>Myrica</i>) have some culinary 
application. Most <i>Myrica</i> species are used mainly for production 
of wax, insect repellents and medicinals, but one is of culinary 
importance in China.

   [Chinese Bayberry, Japanese Bayberry, Red Bayberry, or Chinese 
   strawberry tree; Yangmei (China); Yamamomo (Japan); 
   <i>Myrica rubra</i>]
   <p>
   Native to China, but extending into Japan and Southeast Asia, this 
   subtropical tree produces edible fruit ranging from white through 
   crimson to dark purple-red.  The fruit is roughly 1 inch diameter, 
   both sweet and very tart, with a single large seed in the center. 
   The seed is not of culinary use. The fruit may be eaten fresh, dried, 
   canned or steeped in alcoholic beverages. The juice is marketed in 
   Europe as Yumberry&reg;. Various parts of the tree and fruit show 
   medicinal potential and are being investigated. &nbsp;

   [Redneck reefer, Sweet bush, genus <i>Comptonia</i> sp. 
   <i>peregrina</i>]
   <p>
   Not, of course, a fern, but with fern-like leaves, this 
   plant is native to eastern North America from southern Quebec to northern 
   Georgia. Buds, when smoked, are reputed to be a mild relaxant, and 
   its presence in the U.S. Southeast accounts for the name "redneck 
   reefer".</p>
   <p>The nuts are like tiny pointy acorns less than 1/4 inch long, not 
   practical as food, but young fruits containing the seeds are edible. 
   Young leaves are used as a flavoring and to make an aromatic herb tea. 
   Leaves are said to help preserve other fruits if used as a basket 
   lining. Crushed leaves can be used as insect repellant, burning 
   leaves repel mosquitos and dried leaves are used as incense.

<h2>Beech Family</h2>
<p>[<i>Fagaceae</i>] &nbsp; Beeches are native to the temperate zone 
of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Beech</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_beech01k.jpg" alt="Beech Leaves and nuts on Tree" class=mrg>
   [genus <i>Fagus</i>, various species]
   <p>
   Beech is a very common, often dominant, deciduous forest tree 
   throughout the northern hemisphere. While beech nuts are edible, this 
   tree is much better known for its hard wood and as a decorative. Aside 
   from furniture, flooring and vernier, the wood is used for smoking 
   some cheeses and smoking the malt for German smoked beers. Beech wood 
   chips are also used to "fine" Anheuser Bush beers.
   &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0055</a>
   </small>.</p>
   <p>The nuts are triangular, about 1/2 inch long and have a somewhat 
   sweet taste and high protein content. They also contain mild toxins 
   which can make you sick if you eat more than around 40 of them. The 
   nuts can be squeezed for cooking oil, but gathering them is so labor 
   intensive it is only done in times of hardship. The toxins are not 
   contained in the oil. Southern hemisphere beeches were once though 
   closely related to those of the northern hemisphere but are now 
   separated into family <i>Nothofagus</i>.
   <br class=cll></p>


   <h3>Oak (Acorn)</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_acorn01e.jpg" alt="Acorns and Oak Leaves on Tree" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Oaks are found in temperate regions throughout the northern hemisphere, 
   producing nuts called Acorns. These were a major food resource in 
   Europe and Asia from prehistoric times almost to the modern age, 
   particularly in Iberia, but also in Greece, Japan and Korea. They have 
   since fallen out of use in most of the world, except in Spain (for 
   pigs) and Korea (for humans). &nbsp;  <small>Photo &copy; 
   <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0056</a></small></p>
   <p>Acorns do not appear in your nut bowl because most are very bitter 
   and somewhat toxic, except to pigs. They must be chopped, pounded into 
   meal or ground into flour and soaked in running or frequently changed 
   water to leach out tannic acid.</p> 
   <p>Acorns have always been important to the indigenous peoples of North 
   America, particularly in California where tribes engaged in extensive 
   forest management to assure a steady supply. Some tribal groups still 
   prepare acorns for soup and porridge, both as a normal family food and 
   to acknowledge ancestral traditions.</p>
   <p>Roasted acorns were ground to make a coffee substitute in the 
   Confederate States during the Civil War blockade, and have been so 
   used in other countries as well. Acorn oil has also been used for 
   cooking in the Middle East.</p>    
   <p>Another important culinary use for oak is wine corks, made from the 
   bark of the Cork Oak (<i>Quercus suber</i>). Without this bark Champaign 
   would not have been possible and wine would be difficult to keep long 
   enough for proper age.

   <h3>Acorn Jelly</h3>
   <br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/ok_acorng02k.jpg" alt="Block of Acorns Jelly" class=mrg>
   <p>Korea is the one modern country where acorns are still a 
   significant food item for humans. Some families in the mountainous 
   regions still gather acorns and process them into starch. The starch 
   is made into a porridge, which when cold becomes a jelly. This jelly 
   is popular in salads, soups and as an appetizer.

   <h3>Chestnut</h3>
   <br><a href="ok_chestz.html">
   <img src="img/ok_chest07h.jpg" alt="Chestnuts Fruit opening to show Nuts" class=mrg></a>
   [genus <i>Castanea</i>, various species]
   <p>This common nut is notable for being starchy rather than oily, so 
   it is used quite differently from other nuts. These nuts were a major 
   food item in parts of Europe, particularly in Spain, but in the late 
   1700s blight wiped out vast chestnut forests resulting in famine. 
   While they have been largely replaced by potatoes for general 
   sustenance, many recipes still call for them.</p>
   <p>The American Chestnut which once dominated our deciduous forests 
   was almost totally wiped out in the early 1900s by blight from Asia. 
   Efforts to develop an American variety with Asian resistance to the 
   blight are said near success - but it has been reported some groves 
   seem to have developed resistance on their own. Meanwhile, nearly all 
   chestnuts sold in the North America are imported from Europe, China 
   or Korea.

   <h3>Chinquapin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_chinquapin01h.jpg" alt="Chinquapin Nuts" class=mrg>
   [genus <i>Castanopsis</i> many species (East Asia) | genus 
   <i>Chrysolepis</i>, Golden chinquapin, Giant chinquapin 
   <i>C. crysophylla</i> (California, Oregon, Washington); 
   Bush chinquapin, <i>C. sempervirens</i> (Oregon, California)]
   <p>
   Chinqapins were once more widely distributed, producing large coal 
   deposits in Germany, but they are now confined to East and Southeast 
   Asia and the U.S. West Coast. The trees produce edible nuts but 
   chinquapins are used mainly for forestry or as decoratives. 
   <u>Note</u>: some members of the chestnut genus are also called 
   "chinquapin".</p>
   <p>The nuts, once removed from their hard spiny chestnut-like cupule 
   (husk), resemble pointy acorns. They are gathered locally but seldom 
   sold commercially. They also serve as food for pigs, deer, rodents 
   and other animals. In Japan the wood is important as the preferred 
   substrate for growing shiitake mushrooms. &nbsp;

<h2 id="birch">Birch Family</h2>

<p>[<i>Betulaceae</i>] &nbsp; Birches are native to the temperate zone 
of the Northern Hemisphere, though a few have reached the Andes region 
of South America. They first appear in the fossil record in the 
Cretaceous (about 70 million years ago) in central China.

   <h3>Alder</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_alder01h.jpg" alt="Alder Catkins and Cones on Tree" class=mrg>
   [genus <i>Alnus</i>, various species]
   <p>
   Alder is a widespread tree important for cabinetry, electric guitars 
   and charcoal production. Although the catkins are edible and high in 
   protein, they are bitter so are used only as survival food. The main 
   culinary use for alder is for smoking fish. It is almost the only 
   wood used for smoking Pacific salmon.
   &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0057</a>
   </small>.</p>
   <p>The bark contains salicin which turns into salicylic acid when 
   digested, a compound very close to the active ingredient in aspirin, 
   acetylsalicylic acid, and has been used for similar purposes.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Birch</h3>
   <a href="ok_birchz.html">
   <br><img src="img/ok_birchp01h.jpg" alt="Birch Leaves with Cantkins on Tree" class=mrg></a>
   [genus <i>Betula</i>: North America: <i>Betula lenta</i> (Black Birch): 
   <i>Betula papyrifera</i> (Paper Birch): <i>Betula neoalaskana</i> 
   (Alaska Birch): <i>Betula fontinalis</i> (Red Birch) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   Eurasia: <i>Betula alba</i> (White Birch): <i>Betula pendula</i> 
   (Silver Birch)]
   <p>
   Birch are northern temperate medium size trees and shrubs with a wide 
   distribution through Europe, Asia and North American. Birch is well 
   known in North America for use of its easily peelable  white bark in 
   American Indian crafts, including the hulls of canoes. The bark is 
   highly resistant to decay and was also used as writing material in 
   northern Europe and Siberia.</p>
   <p>Birch sap is used in the Frozen North (North America through 
   Siberia) and as far south as Ukraine, to make beverages, syrups, 
   flavorings, and medicinals. Note that the product from the Philippines 
   called "Birch Flower" is not actually birch. It is from a member of 
   the Mulberry family, <a href="mb_alokonz.html"><i>Broussonetia 
   luzonica</i></a>.

   Corylus maxima (Filbert) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Corylus heterophylla</i> 
   (Asian Hazel)]
   <p>
   Hazelnut species are found throughout the northern hemisphere and all 
   produce edible nuts but only the ones listed above are in commercial 
   production. The leafy cover of filberts is much longer than the nut, 
   tighter around it, and reddish in color. The largest producer of 
   hazelnuts, by far, is Turkey with Italy second. The largest U.S. 
   producer is Oregon state, but recent large plantings in California 
   are coming on-line.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens show shelled nuts (front), nuts in shell 
   (middle) and nuts still in the leafy husks (involucres). Those in the 
   husks are a rather elongated variety compared to the other shelled 
   specimens and were probably grown in California.

<h2 id="wal">Walnut Family</h2>

<p>[family <i>Juglandaceae.</i>] &nbsp; Native to the temperate zone of 
the Northern Hemisphere, several members of this family are of 
considerable culinary interest for their nuts. All these fall into two 
genera, <i>Juglans</i> (Walnuts) and <i>Carya</i> (Hickory). These trees 
are all also of great value for their wood.</p>

   <h3>Persian Walnut</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_walnut09e.jpg" alt="Persian Walnutes, whole and shelled" class=mrg>
   [English Walnut, <i>Juglans regia</i>]
   <p>
   Probably originating somewhere around Kyrgyzstan, this nut tree 
   was common from the Balkans to southwest China in ancient times. It was 
   spread farther into Europe in ancient Greek and Roman times. Important 
   commercial growing areas are California, China, France, Southern Europe 
   and Chile. The tree is highly valued both for its nuts and for very 
   useful hard wood.</p>
   <p>Kernels of this nut are much used in baked goods in the West, 
   particularly during the winter holidays. They are also eaten fresh, 
   mostly in nut mixes, and  are pressed for a flavorful cooking oil. 
   They are very important in the cuisines of Anatolia, Caucasus and 
   Persia, where they have many uses. The photo specimens were  1.6 
   inches long, 1.4 inches diameter and weighed about 1/2 ounce with a 
   nutmeat yield of 1/4 ounce (50%). This will vary depending on 
   freshness. In the shell these nuts will last several months but 
   slowly lose flavor. When purchasing, check for rancidity.</p>
   <p>Walnuts may have important medicinal value. They are being studied for 
   reducing arterial placque, as a treatment for insulin-dependent 
   diabetes and for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Green Walnut Preserve</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_walgrn02h.jpg" alt="Whole Preserved Walnut Fruits" class=mrg>
   [<i>Juglans regia</i>]
   <p>
   These are whole immature walnut fruits, including the outer flesh 
   and skin, preserved in a medium sweet syrup. The shell inside has not 
   yet hardened, so the entire fruit is edible. It has a somewhat granular 
   texture, is very slightly astringent, and has a hint of walnut flavor. 
   I find them quite pleasant, though a bit sweet. Of the photo specimens, 
   the largest was 1-1/4 inches  diameter and weighted 7/8 ounce. Product 
   of Armenia - ingred: walnut, sugar, water, cloves, ginger, citric acid.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Black Walnut</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_walblk01h.jpg" alt="Black Walnut Fruits on Tree" class=mrg>
   [American Walnut, <i>Juglans nigra</i>]
   <p>
   Native to North America, this large tree produces very hard wood, 
   and hard nuts as well. Flavor is excellent, intense and distinctive, but 
   these nuts are so difficult and messy to deal with they are not widely 
   appreciated. Where I lived in my childhood, in the back woods of New Jersey, 
   we had a large black walnut on the property. I'm very familiar with the 
   black stains from the husks, and shells so hard they are used as an 
   industrial abrasive. The meats are not easy to extract from the shells 
   either.
   &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0059</a>
   </small>.</p>
   <p>The nuts are, however, shelled commercially and are popular for 
   flavoring ice cream and baked goods. The wood is used for furniture, 
   gunstocks, flooring and other applications. A single tree is worth well  
   over US $2000 as lumber so poaching is a constant problem.

   <h3>Butternut</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_walwht01h.jpg" alt="Butternuts on Tree" class=mrg>
   [White Walnut, <i>Juglans cinerea</i>]
   <p>
   Native to eastern North America from Ontario to Alabama and west to 
   Minnesota and Arkansas, this tree is now considered endangered in 
   many areas due to a fungal disease. The oily nuts are used mainly in 
   baking and candies. The wood is used for furniture and woodcarving, 
   and the nut hulls were formerly used to dye cloth a color between 
   light yellow and dark brown.

   <br><img src="img/ok_hickory02h.jpg" alt="Shagbark Hickory Nuts on Tree" class=mrg>
   [<i>Carya ovata</i>]
   <p>
   There are about 20 species of Hickory, most in North America but some in 
   China and Indochina. The nuts of most hickory trees are too bitter for 
   human consumption but many animals depend on them.</p>
   <p>The nuts of the Shagbark, have excellent flavor and are much liked by 
   those to whom they are available. These nuts are not produced commercially 
   because the trees produce too seldom. The bark is also used to flavor a 
   sugar syrup to make it more like maple syrup. &nbsp; <small> Photo by

   <h3>Chinese Hickory</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_hickch02h.jpg" alt="Chinese Hickory Nuts, whole and broken" class=mrg>
   [<i>Carya cathayensis</i>]
   <p>
   This Hickoy Nut is a major commercial product in some counties or 
   Zhejiang Provence on the eastern coast of central China. The photo 
   specimens were typically 3/4 inch diameter. They were roasted and 
   flavored with Salt, Sugar Fennel and Cinnamon. In this form they 
   were tasty, but rather difficult to eat as the meats do not come 
   willingly out of their complexly partitioned shells. You need a 
   tack hammer, some sort of anvil, and a sharp metal pick, and most 
   segments will come out broken in pieces. The photo specimens were 
   purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) 
   for 2018 US $6.69 for a 6.3 ounce bag.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Pecan</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_pecan03e.jpg" alt="Pecan Nuts, whole and opened" class=mrg>
   [<i>Carya illinoinensis</i>]
   <p>
   Native to North America from Illinois south through Texas and 
   into Mexico, these nuts are most grown in Georgia, followed by 
   Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. They did not become a commercial crop 
   until the 1880s and few are yet grown outside the United States. Pecans 
   are often eaten fresh but are also used in cooking, mostly for pies and 
   sweet deserts. The shells are very thin, so the attractively shaped meats 
   are fairly easy to remove without breaking, are often used decoratively.</p>
   <p>These will keep for several months in the shell, kept in a cool dry 
   place, but flavor will slowly decline. The largest photo specimen was 
   2 inches long, 0.88 inch diameter and weighed 0.3 ounce with a nutmeat 
   yield of 0.16 ounce.   
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Wingnut</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ok_wing01k.jpg" alt="Wingnut Catkin on Tree" class=mrg>
   [genus <i>Pterocarya</i>]
   <p>
   These nut trees are native from the Caucasus throughout temperate 
   Asia. The nuts grow in a string form called a "catkin", each nut having 
   two wings.  The nuts are about the size of a chickpea and are not of 
   culinary importance. This tree is used mainly as a fast growing decorative 
   and sometimes for timber. There is also a closely related Wheel Wingnut 
   (<i>Cyclocarya paliurus</i>) with a single disk shaped wing.

   <p>These trees are not to be confused with extreme "socially conservative" 
   members of the Republican Party and Tea Parties, also called "wingnuts". 
   I guess one that's a corporate CEO would be a "wheel wingnut".
