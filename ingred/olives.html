<span class=bg>
The Olives (<i>Olea europaea</i> of family <i>Oleaceae</i> in the 
order <i>Lamiales</i>) are fruiting 
trees of great importance to the nourishment and economies of peoples 
in the Mediterranean region and California. The fruit is high in 
oil rather than sugar so provides a great deal of energy, and the finest 
cooking and salad oil known to man. If that were not enough, the fruits can 
be prepared in many flavorful ways for inclusion in recipes and for eating 
in their own right.

<h2 class=lrg id="hist">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Olives have been cultivated since before the dawn of history and were a 
critical crop to peoples all around the Mediterranean. Not only did oily 
olives provide a great deal of food energy, they grow well in soils that 
won't support most other crops.</p>

<p>They are touchy about climate though, and must have cold nights with 
warm days in the winter to set flowers. They are also frost tender which 
further limits where they can be grown. It's a safe bet though that olive 
trees have been planted in just about every area of the world to which 
they are suitable.</p>

<p>Unlike other vegetable oils, olive oil can be extracted by moderate 
pressure at room temperature and without the use of solvents which makes it 
easily available to peoples with limited technology. For early communities 
olive oil's importance as a cooking oil was paralleled by its use for 
illumination as lamp oil, by its medicinal applications and by its use in 
religious rituals.</p>

<p>One Italian king had millions of olive trees cut down because he felt 
they made life too easy for the peasants. He felt the natural order 
of things was for peasants to be poor and have to work hard. The financial 
impact on his life insurance carrier was immediate and decisive.</p>

<p>Today cured olives are a luxury rather than a survival necessity, but 
olive oil is still of great economic and culinary importance. Available in 
the wide range of quality and flavors we associate with wine, it is also a
cooking oil that can withstand high temperatures and is resistant to 
oxidation and rancidity. It is, in fact, the only oil both sides of the 
fierce coconut oil vs. soy oil battle agree is healthy.
</p>
<br>


<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties</h2>

<p>There are over 650 varieties of olive grown, and each may be cured in 
more than one way, which makes for a dizzying selection. Listed here are 
a few of the more common varieties found in commerce.</p>

<p>Because fresh olives are far too bitter to eat straight off the tree, the  
examples here are all for cured olives. Countries shown are typical, but 
olives of the same type and cure can be made in several other countries.</p>

<p>Pictured varieties are ones I've found in my local stores. Our infamous 
<b>kidney bean</b> in the pictures is there to help you judge the size of 
the olives.</p>

<h2>Agrinion</h2>
<br>Greek, large green olives.<p></p>

<h2>Aleppo</h2>
<br>Syrian black <a href="olives.html#salt">dry cured</a> olives. Very rare in the 
North America - and probably pretty rare everywhere now that Syria is 
in the midst of violent self destruction.<p></p>

<h2>Alphonso</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_alphons05e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Alphonso Olives" class=mrg>
From Chile and/or Peru, fairly large olives cured in salt brine with red 
wine and/or red wine vinegar which colors them dark purple. They are tart 
and may have a touch of bitter. 100-200/kg, with 100-130/kg preferred. 
The photo specimens were typically 1.33 inches long, 0.84 inch 
diameter and weighed 0.3 ounces each.
<br>subst: <a href="olives.html#kalam">kalamata</a>.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Amphissa</h2>
<br>A small black olive particularly favored for tapenade spreads, meat 
stews and red sauces. They are given a <a href="olives.html#natural">natural cure</a> 
in salt brine.<p></p>

<h2>Arauco</h2>
<br>Spanish, larger than regular Spanish olives they are given a 
<a href="olives.html#ferment">fermented lye cure</a> and often packed with rosemary.<p></p>

<h2>Arbequina</h2>
<br>Spanish, much smaller than regular spanish olives they have a mild, 
slightly smoky flavor. Packed seed-in and used in oil production.<p></p>

<h2>Ascolano Olive</h2>
<br>An olive grown in California used both as a table olive, either green 
or black, and sometimes for oil. it is slightly smaller than the 
Sevillano.<p></p>

<h2>Atalanta</h2>
<br>Greek, with a muddy-green color and soft flesh.<p></p>

<h2>Atlas Olive</h2>
<br>These are the largest size of the Greek <a href="olives.html#halk">Halkidiki</a> 
olives.<p></p>

<h2>Beldi</h2>
<br>From Morocco, these medium size green olives are given a 
<a href="olives.html#ferment">Fermented Lye Cure</a> so are similar to Spanish olives. 
The flesh is fairly crisp.<p></p>

<h2 id="bella">Bella di Cerignola</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_cerigrgk02e.jpg" alt="Green, Red and Black Bella di Cerignola Olives" class=mrg>
Italian, very large meaty olives cured either green or ripe, in which 
case they can be cured out with a red color making for an attractive red / 
green mix. They are also made in a deep black color. They are in demand for 
appetizers and tend to be expensive. These olives are given a 10 hour lye 
soak, then fermented in 9% brine for a minimum of 4 weeks. The difference 
in color is from processing. The red are dyed with Red Dye #3, the green 
aren't dyed and the black are treated with bubbling air and ferrous 
gluconate, the same as California Mission olives. The black are usually 
sold separate from the mixed green and red. The largest of the blacks was 
2.83 inches long and 1.03 inches diameter, the red 1.56 inches long by 
0.95 inch diameter, the green 1.30 inches long, 0.90 inch diameter. 
These olives are sized GGG (21-80/kg), GG (81-90/kg) and G (91-120/kg). 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Black Olives</h2>
<br>Tree ripened olives picked after they turn black, except California 
canned mission olives which are picked green ripe and colored black by 
processing. American recipes calling for black olives presume canned 
mission olives, but all European, Near Eastern and North African recipes 
presume black <a href="olives.html#salt">dry cured</a> or <a href="olives.html#natural">natural 
cured</a> olives which have a far more intense flavor.<p></p>

<h2 id="calif">California Olives</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_cal01.jpg" alt="Green and Black California Olives" class=mrg>
The first olive trees planted in California were brought by missionaries 
from Spain, the so called <a href="olives.html#mission">Mission Olive</a>. The plan 
was to create an olive oil industry, but it couldn't compete with cheap 
imported oil and the orchards didn't become economically viable until 
invention of the "green ripe" lye cure canning process.<p></p>
<p>In recent times many other olive varieties have been planted, and, as 
with California wine, boutique growers have developed cures similar to 
and fully competitive with the best imported products. The photo shows 
large "estate grown" cocktail olives stuffed with pimiento, garlic and 
jalapeno peppers, Mediterranean style cracked olives cured with red chili 
on the left and zatar (thyme) on the right, and black and green salad 
olives in the back.
</p>
<p>California also produces olive oils that stand head-to-head with the 
very best Italy offers. Pricing varies widely with grower and can get 
absurd if some popular food pundit has just declared California oils 
"the best there is".
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="cast">Castelvetrano Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_castel02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Castelvetrano Olives" class=mrg>
From Sicily, these olives are lye cured like canned 
<a href="olives.html#mission">California Mission</a> olives, but without the treatment 
to turn them black. This process is responsible for the rather lurid green 
color. Put up in jars rather than cans, and without the ferrous gluconate, 
they have a similar but more pleasant flavor than the Mission olives, and 
they are a little saltier. Because they are low in salt, the same warnings 
apply - once opened, eat them within the day or refrigerate. These are for 
eating, not cooking and will not work in European, Near Eastern or North 
African recipes. Typically 0.80 inch diameter, the photo specimens were 
purchased from an import emporium in Los Angeles.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2 id="chinb">Chinese Black Olive</h2> 
<br><img src="img/ol_chinblk01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Chinese Black Olives" class=mrg>
[Wu lan; <i>Canarium pimela</i> syn. <i>C. tramdenum</i>]
<p>
This fruit is preserved in brine and used similarly to black ripe 
<i>Oleaceae</i> olives but is not really an olive at all. It is the fruit of 
a large resinous tree, related to the frankinsense tree, native to 
Southeast Asia and southern China. The flesh is 
relatively thin and the seed large and sharply pointed at both ends. Aside 
from the brined fruit, the seed kernels inside the pits of this and 
related species are sold as Canarium nut, Pili nut or Galip nut. The 
photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, 
packed in brine.
<br style="clear:left"></p>

<h2 id="chinw">Chinese White Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_chinwht01e.jpg" alt="Bin of Chinese White Olives" class=mrg>
[Nam liap, Samo chin, Kana (Thai); kan-lan (China); buah cana (Malay); 
<i>Canarium album</i>]
<p>
This olive shaped fruit is used similarly to <i>Oleaceae</i> olives but is 
not really an olive at all. It is the fruit of a large resinous tree, 
related to the frankinsense tree, native to Southeast Asia and southern 
China. Why it is called "white" is unknown to me. The fruits are used in 
cooking both fresh, where they are somewhat resinous, and preserved by 
soaking in brine and drying. They are particularly popular in Thailand and 
Vietnam. This fruit is also used in Asian herbal medicines and cosmetics.

<h2 id="greekd">Greek Dry</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_greekdry1e.jpg" alt="Whole Greek Dry Olives" class=mrg>
Greek <a href="olives.html#salt">salt/oil cured</a> olives. Wrinkled in appearance, 
they are an excellent olive for cooking - particularly good in pasta 
sauces and with meat. The examples here were actually made in Turkey, a 
major source of fine olives, and are excellent for just eating too.
<br style="clear:left"><p></p>

<h2>Green Olives</h2>  &nbsp; These are olives picked before they 
are ripe and cured in various ways. The common supermarket green olive in 
jars, seed-in or stuffed, is the Spanish <a href="olives.html#manz">Manzanilla</a> 
and the larger ones are commonly <a href="olives.html#sevil">Sevillano</a>. Fresh 
picked green olives are often available in ethnic markets in California 
for those who wish to cure their own olives.<p></p>

<h2 id="halk">Halkidiki Olive / Chalkidiki Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_halkid05h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Halkidiki Olives" class=mrg>
From the Greek region of Macedonia, this very large olive is normally 
given a <a href="olives.html#ferment">Fermented Lye Cure</a>. These are often pitted 
and stuffed. A smaller amount are given a cure in salt brine with citric 
and ascorbic acid for about 3 months. This gives a very different flavor. 
The photo specimens were typically 1.56 inch diameter and weighed 5/8 
ounce. They were purchased from Trader Joes for 2016 US $2.29 for 
9.88 ounces drained weight. Flavor and texture were very good.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Hojiblanca</h2>
<br>A Spanish olive very similar to the Manzanilla but it has a firmer 
textured flesh and the color is a deeper green.<p></p> 

<h2>Hondroelia</h2>
<br>Greek olives, tan color and fairly large and meaty, they are given 
a <a href="olives.html#natural">natural brine cure</a> for up to a year.<p></p>

<h2 id="kalam">Kalamata</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_kalmat1e.jpg" alt="Dark and Light Kalamata Olives" class=mrg>
Greek purple-black olives with intense flavor and generally fairly salty. 
These almond shaped olives are harvested fully ripe and given a 
<a href="olives.html#natural">natural cure</a> in salt brine and red wine vinegar, 
then packed pit-in.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="koura">Koura Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_koura02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Koura Olives" class=mrg>
From the Koura district of Lebanon, these are very highly regarded by the 
people of the Levant. They are primarily used for olive oil, but also given 
a natural salt and oil cure for eating. They are medium firm, very oily 
with a slight bitterness. They are salty, but edible without soaking. 
Typically 0.68 inch diameter, 300/kg.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Liguria</h2>
<br>Italian small black olives. These are given a <a href="olives.html#natural">natural 
cure</a> in salt brine and packed pit-in and sometimes with stems on. They 
are similar to the French.<p></p>

<h2>Lucques</h2>
<br>French, an elongated, crescent shaped green olive with a pointy end, 
These are much favored by French gourmets who say the taste reminds them 
of almond and avocado. They are given a unique cure, soaked for about 12 
hours in lye, water soaked to remove the lye and then fermented under 
refrigeration for about one month. 220-340/kg with larger preferred.
<p></p>

<h2>Lugano</h2>
<br>Italian black olives which are given a <a href="olives.html#natural">natural 
cure</a> or a  and are commonly very salty. They are packed pit-in and sometimes 
with olive leaves.<p></p>

<h2 id=manz>Manzanilla</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_manza1e.jpg" alt="Cured Whole and Stuffed Manzanilla Olives" class=mrg>
Spanish green olives that are also grown in California. They are commonly 
given a <a href="olives.html#ferment">fermented lye cure</a>, then packed in a brine 
of salt and lactic acid. Sold unpitted and/or pitted and stuffed in 
various sizes, 200-320/kg. I have found Spanish manzanilla olives 
marketed under the Goya label excellent in flavor and texture.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Manzanilla Perdigon</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_manzp02h.jpg" alt="Cured Manzanilla Perdigon Olives" class=mrg>
This is the smallest size of Spanish Manzanilla Olives, 340-400/kgm. 
They are given the typical Spanish <a href="olives.html#ferment">fermented lye 
cure</a> and are always sold with the pits in. The photo specimens, 
typically 0.50 inch diameter, were purchased for 2016 US $2.29 for 21 
ounces drained weight.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="mission">Mission Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_misshb1e.jpg" alt="Black Cured Mission Olives Olives" class=mrg>
This is the infamous California canned olive (usually black but sometimes 
green, usually pitted but sometimes not). The trees, similar to 
<a href="olives.html#manz">Manzanilla</a>, were brought to California by Spanish 
missionaries in the 1700s in hopes of building an olive oil industry. 
That plan failed because it couldn't compete with cheap imported oil and 
the plantings didn't become economically successful until invention of 
the "green ripe" <a href="olives.html#can">canning process</a> in the 19th century.
<p>Use these in American recipes but never European, Near Eastern or 
North African, where something more flavorful like 
<a href="olives.html#greekd">Greek Dry</a> is expected.
<br><b>Caution:</b> with little salt or acid these can't be left out 
long. After opening refrigerate, preferably in their original brine. 
Eating spoiled ones provides an experience you won't forget.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Salad Olives</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_salad1e.jpg" alt="Green and Black Salad Olives" class=mrg>
Commonly canned black but sometimes green pitted olives, though some so 
called may be green in jars and even pimiento stuffed. If so they are 
generally small and sloppily stuffed. Most common in cans is the  
California <a href="olives.html#mission">Mission Olive</a> with a 
<a href="olives.html#can">lye cure</a>. Green ones from Spain may have a 
<a href="olives.html#ferment">fermented lye cure</a>. These are very mild olives and 
must be refrigerated once the can is opened (preferably in the original 
brine) to avoid an unforgettable experience.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<br>

<h2 class=lrg id="cure">Curing Olives</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Home Cured</h2> olives are generally black ripe or turning 
black and processed with lye. They are first soaked in a strong lye 
solution for several days, breaking an olive open occasionally to see if 
the lye has penetrated to the pit. When it has, they are soaked in 
several changes of salt brine until the lye has been leeched out. They 
are finally put up in jars in a strong salt brine. For use, they may 
require a soak in cold water to leech out some of the salt.<p></p>

<h3 id="can">Lye Cured</h3> commercial canned olives 
are processed similar to the Home Cure. All the olives are picked green or 
nearly so, even those that will end up as black olives (to produce a 
firmer black olive). First they are soaked in a lye solution long enough 
to penetrate to the pits. For black olives air is bubbled through this 
solution causing the olives to darken. The final brine for black olives 
includes ferrous gluconate to intensify the black color. After canning, 
both black and green are pasteurized with steam. Canning and 
pasteurization allows a much less salty product than the home cured, 
or most other cures for that matter.<p></p>

<h3 id="ferment">Fermented Lye Cure</h3> is generally 
used in Spain. Green olives are soaked in lye similar to the Home Cure but 
the brine soak stage lasts for about three months during which the olives 
ferment somewhat, giving them that unique Spanish flavor. They are then 
bottled and pasteureized with steam.<p></p>

<h3 id="salt">Dry Salt Cure</h3> results in soft 
chewy olives with a wrinkled appearance. The olives are first lightly 
crushed so the salt will penetrate, then layered in salt for about four 
weeks. When done they are rinsed with cold water and dried. Finally they 
are coated with olive oil after which they may be pasteurized. This cure 
is used for Dry Greek, Italian Gaeta and other Mediterranean olives.
<p></p>

<h3 id="natural">Natural Cures</h3> are used for a 
number of Mediterranean olive varieties. One method is to soak the olives 
in cold water that is changed daily until the bitterness is leached out, 
after which they are cured in a salt brine for several months. A method 
used for Sicilian olives is to soak in a brine of salt and lactic acid 
for about a year. Kalmata, Amphissa, Nicoise, Picholine, Cerignola and 
Gaeta olives are generally soaked in a salt brine for about a year.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p><b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; low salt olives such as lye cured Mission olives 
and many salad and cocktail olives will spoil once opened. They should be 
eaten within the day or refrigerated and eaten within a couple of days. 
Eating spoiled ones will provide you with an experience you will not 
forget. High salt dry and naturally cured olives do not present this 
danger.</p>

<p>Olives are high in oil, 13% or higher depending on type and cure, 
so they are higher in calories per ounce than most fruit. They are low 
in carbohydrates, typically less than 6%.</p>

<p>Today, olive fruit is a luxury item and eaten in relatively small 
quantity, but olive oil is of great culinary and health importance. Since 
the oil is the dominant aspect of the fruit anyway, we refer you to our
