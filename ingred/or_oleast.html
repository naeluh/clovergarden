<h1>Oliasters</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Oleasters (family <i>Elaeagnaceae</i>) are a small family with only 
three genera. They mostly inhabit northern temperate climates, but some 
species extend through Southeast Asia to Australia. In Europe and Asia 
they have been used as minor food items and medicinals since prehistoric 
times. Today, one species, Sea-Buckthorn, is being hyped by high price 
chefs - until they find something new.

<h2>Igde</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_igde01h.jpg" alt="Dried Russian Olive Berries" class=mrg>
[Russian Olive, Russian Silverberry, Oleaster, Wild Olive; 
<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>]
<p>
Native from Southern Russia through Turkey and Iran, this shrub has been 
introduced to North America, where it has become an invasive. It's roots 
host a bacteria that fixes nitrogen, so it does fine in rather poor 
soils. The red fruits are lightly sweet-tart with a dry, mealy mouth feel. 
The photo specimens, labeled "Igde", were purchased in Los Angeles from 
a multi-ethnic market serving significant communities from the plant's 
native regions. They were about 1.0 inch long and 0.65 inch diameter. 
The skins are extremely thin and papery, and the dried fruits weighed 21 
to the ounce.  In Iran, powdered fruit is mixed with milk as a treatment 
for joint pain, and they are used in the traditional Persian Spring 
festival, Haft Sin.

<h2>Sea-Buckthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_seabuck02h.jpg" alt="Sea Buckthorn Berries" class=mrg>
[Sandthorn, Sallowthorn, Seaberry; <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i>]
<p>
Native to Nepal, this shrub spread throughout Eurasia, from Britain to 
China and from Norway to Spain. While long used as an ingredient in 
alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, particularly in southern France, 
it has recently become an "ingredient of the moment" (2018) among high 
priced chefs serving the 1%. These guys live by hyping rare ingredients 
for a few months, then move on. The yellow fruits are tiny, taking more 
than 28 berries to weigh an ounce, and difficult to harvest, so the tart 
fruit or juice is quite expensive - perfect for the chef set.</p>
<p>These berries are quite tart, but their bitterness is reduced by the 
first frost. The photo specimens, from Lithuania, were purchased from the 
frozen food cases of a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) 
for 2019 US $6.32 / pound. The largest were about 0.42 x 0.34 inch. 
Interestingly, they don't freeze at all solid at -4&deg;F/-20&deg;C. 
Sea-Buckthorn is high in vitamin C, and has recently been in the 
news due to a Chinese study that showed it effective in supporting 
eye health and reducing macular degradation. The active ingredient is 
Proanthocyanidins, which are also in red wine, baking chocolate, apples 
and dried fruits.

<h2>Buffaloberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_buffalos01h.jpg" alt="Fruit on Branch" class=mrg>
[Silver Buffaloberry; <i>Shepherdia argentea</i> | Canadian 
Buffaloberry <i>Shepherdia canadensis</i>]
<p>
Silver Buffaloberry is native to south central Canada and north central 
United States, but scattered patches can be found as far south as Utah 
and Northern California. Canadian Buffaloberry is found across North 
America from the Arctic Circle down into northern United States. 
Buffaloberries, particularly the Canadian, were important to American 
Indians within their range. Though the berries can be quite bitter, the 
bitterness is combined with sweetness. The berries, which are about 0.20 
inch diameter, can be prepared similarly to cranberry sauce or cranberry 
cocktail, and after they are sweetened by the first frost, can be made 
into jellies, jams and syrups, though usually mixed with sweeter fruit.
</p>
<p>One major use has been in preparation of xoosum (Indian ice cream). 
The bitterness is from saponins, but these enable the berries to become 
"sudsy" when whipped. buffaloberries are mixed with sweet fruit such as 
raspberries and beaten vigorously until a heavy foam is created.

<h2>American Silverberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_amsilver02h.jpg" alt="Foliage" class=mrg>
[Wolf-willow; <i>Elaeagnus commutata</i>]
<p>
Native to Alaska south to Utah and across Canada and the northernmost 
states of the United States, these shrubs are found mostly in sandy or 
gravely soils. Because they host nitrogen fixing bacteria in their roots, 
they can thrive in such poor soils. The photo specimens were growing 
in Montana. The silvery berries, which grow to nearly 1/2 inch long, are 
edible but sour and rather floury in texture, so are not sought after. 
The plant contains Beta-carbolines, which are somewhat psychedelic, used 
mostly in combination with other substances.

<h2>Goumi</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_goumi01h.jpg" alt="Berries on Branch" class=mrg>
[Gumi, Natsugumi, Cherry silverberry; <i>Elaeagnus multiflora</i>]
<p>
Native to East Asia, fruits of this shrub have long been valued as 
a "nutraceutical" in China, a food with medicinal value. It has been 
planted as a decorative in Europe and North America, where it has become 
somewhat invasive. The fruits can be up to 0.4 inch long and are juicy 
and sweet, but with an astringent taste likened to rhubarb.

<h2>Japanese silverberry</h2>
<br><img src="img/or_autumn01h.jpg" alt="Berries on Branch" class=mrg>
[Umbellate oleaster, Autumn-olive, Autumn elaeagnus, Spreading oleaster; 
<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>]
<p>
Native from the Himalayas east to Japan, this shrub does well in very 
poor soil because its roots host a nitrogen fixing bacteria. The fruit 
is juicy and sweet-tart with chewable seeds. Although the berries are 
small, around 0.8 inches long, the shrub is a heavy producer, and the 
fruit dries well. It is very high in the antioxidant lycopene, as much 
as 17 times as much as an equal weight of tomatoes.
