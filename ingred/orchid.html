Orchids (<i>Orchidaceae</i>) define "pretty - but pretty useless" 
in the plant world.</span> They vie with <a href="dy_daisy.html">
Daisies</a> for title as the largest family of plants with more than 800 
genera and almost 30,000 species. Of those only two genera, 
encompassing a very few species have any use as food - and those only 
as flavorings for desserts.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Orchids live in most climates on every continent except Antarctica. The 
family belongs to the order <i>Asparagales</i> (Asparagus) which belongs 
to the clade <i>Monocots</i>, unplaced within the clade Angiosperms 
(flowering plants). It may seem odd that Orchids are related to Asparagus, 
but that's the way the DNA crumbles.</p>
  
<p>Orchids are a pretty odd lot anyway. Those that live in temperate zones 
are like regular plants with roots and stems and chlorophyll, but aren't 
much noted for flowers. Others live on bare rocks surviving on air, water 
and whatever litter blows or washes their way. The majority are tropical 
and live up in trees anchored by aerial roots  and never touch the ground. 
These roots also gather moisture and such nutrients as may wash down the 
tree, but they are not parasites. A few have no chlorophyll and depend on 
fungus to digest food for them.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="salap">Salep</h2>
<br><img src="img/orchid03c.jpg" alt="Salep Orchid" class=mrg>
[<i>Orchis mascula</i> and other species]
<p>
Several orchids that grow wild and cultivated in Turkey are prized for 
their root tubers. These tubers are ground up to produce a starch-like 
polysaccharide used to make a dessert drink called "salep" - once used 
as far away as England and Germany, before the arrival of coffee and tea.
</p>
<p>Today salep is so much in demand in Turkey for the drink, and 
especially to make an ice cream called Dondurma and other desserts, its 
export is illegal. Anything called "salep" found outside Turkey is made 
artificially. The name is derived from Arabic for "fox testicles", 
descriptive of the tuber's appearance and tendency to come in pairs. 
The ancient Romans (and others) considered salep a powerful aphrodisiac 
through sympathetic magic.

<h2 id="vanil">Vanilla Bean</h2>
<br><img src="img/orchid02k.jpg" alt="Vanilla beans" class=mrg>
[<i>Vanilla planifolia</i>, <i>Vanilla pompona</i>, <i>Vanilla 
tahitiensis</i>]
<p>
The dominant vanilla orchid (<i>planifolia</i>) is native to Mexico but 
has been planted in other tropical areas with Madagascar and Indonesia 
the largest producers. Another species (<i>tahitiensis</i>) is grown in 
French Polynesia, but in comparatively minute quantity.</p>
<p>Vanilla beans are long seed pods containing thousands of seeds, but the 
seeds are of no importance. The pods are picked green and then killed, 
usually by heat or sun drying. They are then fermented for 7 to 10 days 
at high temperature and humidity allowing enzymes to convert substances 
in the beans into vanillin and something like 200  other flavoring 
components. The beans are then dried and sorted by quality. &nbsp;
