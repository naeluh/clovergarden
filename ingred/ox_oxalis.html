<h1>Oxalidales - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg><i>Oxalidales</i> is a small order containing seven 
families, two of which provide at least some edible species. Most of 
these are well known in the Indo-Pacific region, and a few in South 
America, only Wood Sorrel being of worldwide distribution.</span>

<h2 id="oxal" class=lrg>Oxalis Family</h2> 

<p><b><i>Oxalidaceae</i></b> is a small but widely distributed family of 
generally sour plants. Most common are the Wood Sorrels, found worldwide, 
sometimes as troublesome weeds.</p>

   <h3>Bilimbi</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ox_bilimbi02e.jpg" alt="Bilimbi Fruits whole, cut" class=mrg>
   [Tree Cucumber; <i>Averrhoa bilimbi</i>]<p>
   This Southeast Asian tree related to the Carambola is now grown in the 
   tropics around the world, but not in the United States because the 
   winters are too cold even in Florida. The fruit is yellow when ripe 
   and five sided like the Carambola but not to such an extreme degree. 
   It may be from 1-1/2 to 4 inches long, ovoid or nearly cylindrical. 
   The photo specimen on the left was 2.8 inches long, 1.1 inches 
   diameter and weighed 1 ounce. These were shipped frozen from the 
   Philippines and were photographed still frozen because they collapse 
   when thawed.</p>
   <p>The fruit is at least as sour as a lemon. It's too tart to eat raw 
   but is used to make jams and beverages. In Costa Rica it's used to 
   make relishes eaten with rice and beans. In Indonesia it's dried, 
   smoked and sold as flavoring Asam Sunti, used for the sour flavor in 
   recipes in that region. It's used fresh for the same purpose in 
   Malaysia. Bilimbi can be found in the frozen foods section of markets 
   serving a Southeast Asian population, particularly Filipino.

   <h3>Star Fruit / Carambola</h3>
   <br><a href="ox_starz.html">
   <img src="img/ox_star05h.jpg" alt="Carambola, whole and cut" class=mrg></a>
   [Coromandel Gooseberry, Kamranga; <i>Averrhoa carambola</i>]
   <p>
   This tree, native to Southeast Asia, has been widely planted in tropical 
   and subtropical parts of the world. There are two commonly sold varieties, 
   tart and sweet, which are difficult to tell apart by sight but the sweet 
   ones tend to have thicker ribs. The main use of Carambola in the U.S. is as 
   a decorative addition to fruit salads and similar dishes. Carambola is 
   more cold tolerant than Bilimbi so is grown commercially in South Florida 
   and in Hawaii. The photo specimen was typical of what we get here in Southern 
   California, 6-3/4 inches long, 4 inches across and weighed 14-3/4 ounces. 
   It was very juicy and tart-sweet, a bit more tart than a tart apple but not 
   at all unpleasant. <a href="ox_starz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

   <h3>Oca</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ox_tuberosa01h.jpg" alt="Oca tubers" class=mrg>
   [New Zealand Yam, <i>Oxalis tuberosa</i>]
   <p>
   This native of the Andean highlands of South America has been 
   introduced to other parts of the world as an alternative to the 
   potato. Outside its home range it has been most successful in 
   New Zealand where a pink variety is grown. Unlike the potato, the 
   leaves and young shoots of the Oca can be eaten as well as the tubers. 
   Oca tubers can be eaten raw, lightly cooked or fully cooked and their 
   response to cooking, from crunchy to soft, is similar to carrots. 
   After harvest, tubers are often left in the sun for a while which 
   reduces the oxalic acid content of the skin and sweetens them. This 
   plant does well in harsh climates and with poor soil, but will only 
   set tubers in temperate areas where there is a sufficient difference 
   in day length from season to season. &nbsp; <small>Photo licensed under

   <h3 id="oxalis">Wood Sorrel</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ox_oxalis09e.jpg" alt="Live oxalis with flowers" class=mrg>
   [Oxalis, <i>Oxalis stricta</i> and other <i>Oxallis</i> species]
   <p>
   A common weed found in moist sunny areas of the garden, oxalis has 
   almost exactly the same taste as the unrelated 
   <a href="cn_sorrelz.html"><b>Sorrel</b></a>. It can be used to spice 
   up salads but should not be used in large quantity because of the high 
   oxalic acid content. It should also not be eaten too often, because 
   oxalic acid can interfere with calcium absorption. There are some 
   900 species found over most of the world, but the photo specimen is 
   <i>O. stricta</i>, the common North American weed. Another species, 
   Redwood Sorrel (<i>O. oregana</i>) native to northern California, 
   Washington, Oregon and into British Columbia has larger leaves, 
   larger white or violet flowers and is a little less tart. Many species 
   with large and decorative flowers are sold in plant nurseries for 
   garden use. Common Wood Sorrel (<i>O. acetosella</i>) is found in 
   most of Europe and Scurvy Grass Sorrel, a South American species 
   (<i>O. enneaphylla</i>), was formerly used by sailors to ward off the 
   vitamin deficiency disease scurvy.

   <h3>Bermuda Sorrel</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ox_bermud01h.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
   [Bermuda buttercup, African wood-sorrel, Buttercup oxalis, 
   Cape sorrel, English weed, Goat's-foot, Sourgrass, Soursob, Soursop 
   (English); Suring (Afrikaans); <i>Oxalis pes-caprae</i>]
   <p>
   Native to South Africa, this plant has become a noxious weed in many 
   regions of the world, including coastal California and especially 
   Australia. In moderate quantities the foliage is palatable, safe to 
   eat, and in South Africa used in traditional soups. It is usually 
   harmless to grazing livestock, but in Australia it grows so profusely 
   it can be hazardous to them. The root tubers are also edible, raw or 
   cooked, and if eaten raw in sufficient quantity have been used to 
   expel tapeworm, and perhaps some other worms.

   [<i>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</i>]
   <p>
   This medium tree, growing to 65 feet high, has a discontinuous 
   distribution: Ghana, Camaroon, Gabon, northern Republic of the Congo 
   and Democratic Republic of the Congo. All parts of the tree smell 
   strongly of Garlic, actually more like fried garlic. Within its 
   range, the fruit is used as a seasoning spice, usually ground. The 
   tree has medicianal potential, particularly extracts of leaves and 
   bark which have strong antioxidant properties.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens, from Cameroon, were 0.77 inch diameter with 
   a 0.73 inch diameter kernel under a very thin brittle skin. They 
   weighed 12 to the ounce. They were purchased on-line for 2018 US $3.50 
   / ounce plus shipping.

   <p>
   This tree is found in much of China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam in 
   woodlands at elevations of between 1000 to 6500 feet and can grow to 
   around 50 feet tall. The small fruits of this tree are edible. Oil is 
   pressed from the seeds but is not used for cooking. The wood rots 
   easily and is used for growing Shiitake mushrooms. The leaves contain 
   a substance that has been found potentially useful for treating 
   radiation induced injury.

   [Veralu (Sinhala); Veralikkai(Tamil); Kaarakka, Kaara (Malayalam); 
   Jolphai (Assamese); Chorphon (Manipur); <i>Elaeocarpus serratus</i>]
   <p>
   Native to Sri Lanka, this tree is found on the Indian Subcontinent as 
   far north as Nepal and Assam, and through much of Southeast Asia, 
   including Indonesia. The fruits, which are up to 1 inch long, are high 
   in starch and sugar, but low in protein. They are ripe when they fall 
   from the tree, but must be gathered soon. Pickled in various ways, they 
   are a popular street food in Sri Lanka, but eaten plain they can 
   cause constipation, and thus may be used as a treatment for diarrhea. 
   In Florida they have been found quite good sliced and cooked in tomato 
   sauce dishes. The seed kernels are reported to taste similar to Brazil 
   Nuts, but are difficult to shell.

   <p>
   Native to Southeast Asia, this tree can grow to 80 feet high and 
   bears clusters of green fruit. These fruit are eaten in Thailand, 
   Vietnam and probably Burma where it is very common. While the 
   Internet abounds with photographs of this fruit, I've found nothing 
   on how it is eaten. Note that both the Thai name Makok and "Spanish 
   Plum" are also used for the completely unrelated 
   <a href="sb_soapbry.html#tahita">Spondias dulcis</a>, the 
   Ambarella or Tahitian Apple.  This leads me to suspect these fruits 
   are used similarly to the much better known Ambarella.

   <p>
   Native to the rainforest of central Chile and extending a little into 
   Argentina, this small tree, growing to about 20 feet, bears black 
   berries about 0.20 inch diameter. the tree is cultivated in Chile on 
   a very small scale, and a little in Spain as well, but most berries 
   are gathered in the wild. They taste similar to blackberries and are 
   eaten fresh, dried or made into jams or beverages. They are now being 
   used as a dietary supplement, being high in antioxidants.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Members of the Oxalis family are made tart by oxalic acid, a substance 
that inhibits absorption of some minerals by the body, particularly 
calcium. Oxalic acid is said to contribute to formation of kidney stones 
and gout but is only one of many contributing factors and probably not a 
very strong one. Because these vegetables are generally consumed 
infrequently and in small quantity, the oxalic acid content should not 
be a significant problem.</p>
