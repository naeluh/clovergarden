[[Coromandel Gooseberry, Kamranga, <i>Averrhoa carambola</i>]]
<p>
This tree, native to Southeast Asia, has been widely planted in tropical 
and subtropical parts of the world. There are two commonly sold varieties, 
tart and sweet, which are difficult to tell apart by sight but the sweet 
ones tend to have thicker ribs. The main use of Carambola in the U.S. is as 
a decorative addition to fruit salads and similar dishes. Carambola is 
more cold tolerant than Bilimbi so is grown commercially in South Florida 
and in Hawaii. The photo specimen was typical of what we get here in Southern 
California, 6-3/4 inches long, 4 inches across and weighed 14-3/4 ounces. 
It was very juicy and tart-sweet, a bit more tart than a tart apple but not 
at all unpleasant.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California these are periodically 
available in Asian and produce markets. The photo specimens were purchased 
in mid May. The fruit should have a firm, slightly waxy feel and be free 
of soft spots. Examine the stem end for signs of rot. I have seen photos 
of bright yellow star fruit, but the ones we get around here are like in 
the photo, or with a bit more yellow.<p></p>
