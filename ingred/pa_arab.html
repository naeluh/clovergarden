<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
The Arabs appear to have used dried noodles as early as 
the 5th century CE as a transportable food for trade and warfare. They 
haven't developed it much since, but may have introduced the drying 
technique to Sicily.  The only Arabic product that qualifies as true 
pasta, made from durum wheat and dried, is couscous, grain-like and 
bead-like forms used across North Africa and through the Levant.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The Arabic name, <i>itriyah</i>, indicates dried noodles obtained from 
a merchant. This implies fresh noodles were already well established in 
home kitchens by the 5th century. Their origin is not known, but the 
Greeks were apparently rolling out a lasagne-like form a thousand years 
before, so it can be considered fairly ancient.</p>

<p>Arabic noodles sold today are from bread wheat, rolled and cut 
into soft fragile strips, so they don't quite qualify as "pasta". They 
are often sold toasted, a treatment not found elsewhere except in 
India.</p>

<p>Some think couscous, a form of true pasta, may have been invented in 
Sardenia and taken from there to North Africa, and eventually to other 
Arab dominated lands - or it could have been developed in North Africa. 
The only thing we can have much confidence in is that Sardenia had durum 
wheat and traded with North Africa. The Arabs introduced dried pasta to 
Sicily, and it traveled from there to Italy after the Arabs were thrown 
out by the Norman king Roger I in 1091.</p><br>


<h2 id="wheat">Wheat Noodles</h2>

<p>I shop at several large markets serving Near and Middle Eastern 
communities in Los Angeles. These bread wheat noodles are the only form 
I've seen that is identified with that region. If any other form was 
of significant importance, I'm sure it would be sold in these markets. 
These noodles have remainied pretty much unchanged since around 500 CE.

   <h3>Arabic Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [166]
   <br><img src="img/pa_166arab1d.jpg" alt="Arabic Noodles 166" class=mrg>
   These noodles, made from bread flour, are very similar in flavor and 
   texture to similarly made Chinese noodles. They are sweeter in 
   flavor and much more elastic than durum wheat pasta. Cooking time 
   about 12 minutes. The photo specimens, probably made in California, 
   were 10.5 x 0.12 x 0.040 inches. Ingred: wheat flour, salt.

   <h3>Arabic Noodles - Toasted</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [167]
   <br><img src="img/pa_167arab2d.jpg" alt="Arabic Toasted Noodles 167" class=mrg>
   These noodles, made from bread flour like the regular Arabic noodles, 
   are then toasted. The flavor is a cross between the regular noodles 
   and toast. Cooking time is about 12 minutes. The photo specimens, 
   probably made in California, were 11 x 0.90 x 0.040 inches. Ingred: 
   wheat flour, salt.

<h2 id="cous">Couscous</h2>

<p>Whether originating from Sardinia or North Africa, couscous, in all 
its variations, is true pasta, made from durum wheat and dried.</p>

   <h3>Couscous Moyen</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [183]
   <br><img src="img/pa_183couscous1h.jpg" alt="Couscous Moyen 183" class=mrg>
   This is the traditional couscous of North Africa. It is cooked by 
   wrapping it in a cloth and steaming, often over a pot in which an 
   accompanying stew is cooking. Boxed "couscous" sold in North America 
   is generally a precooked "quick cooking" version which is quite 
   inferior to the real thing. The photo specimens are product of 
   Morocco, random sizes from .02 to .08 inch. Ingred: durum wheat, water.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Couscous Maftoul</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [202]
   <br><img src="img/pa_202couscous1h.jpg" alt="Couscous Maftoul 202" class=mrg>
   This couscous is popular in the Levant. It is cooked not by steaming 
   as North African couscous is, but by boiling as Italian pasta would 
   be. The photo specimens were product of Jordan, beads about 0.150 inch 
   diameter. Ingred: durum semolina, wheat flour, water, salt.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Couscous Moghrabieh</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [203]
   <br><img src="img/pa_203couscous1h.jpg" alt="Couscous Moghrabieh 203" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This couscous is popular in Lebanon, and properly called Lebanese 
   couscous. This form is often mistakenly called "Israeli couscous". 
   Israeli couscous was actually a failed project to make a rice shaped 
   couscous acceptable to Jewish immigrants from rice eating regions. 
   Like Maftoul, it is cooked by boiling as Italian pasta would be.  The 
   photo specimens were product of Lebanon, beads about 0.24 inch diameter. 
   Ingred: durum semolina, salt.
