<h1>Asian Noodles</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Noodles have been made in China for over 4000 years, but not 
from wheat until more powerful grinding mills were introduced from the 
Roman Empire. Even then, Chinese noodles were much different from the 
pasta Marco Polo was well familiar with before his voyage. Even today, 
real "pasta" is not made in Asia, because the necessary hard durum wheat 
is not sufficiently available, but noodles are made from many grains, 
seeds and starches.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The earliest known noodles have been found in China. Due to a lucky 
accident (lucky for us - not for the inhabitants of the town of Lajia), 
a fresh bowl of noodles was inverted and buried in mud and silt. An air 
pocket under the bowl protected and preserved the noodles, dated to 2000 
BCE. These noodles, about 20 inches long, were made from foxtail millet 
(<i>Setaria italica</i>) and broomcorn millet (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i>).

<p>While in Europe, "pasta" is made almost entirely from hard winter 
wheat and water, and "noodles" are made form softer wheat, and perhaps 
with egg, Asian noodles are made from a number of grains, seeds and 
starches.  While wheat is popular in the northern regions, noodles are 
also made from rice, bean starch, arrowroot starch, tapioca starch, 
sweet potato starch, buckwheat and other materials.</p>

<p>Each of these materials has its own unique properties, so these 
noodles are used in many ways, but "Italian style" with pasta sauces 
is uncommon in Asia today. Extruded shapes such as are common in 
Europe are not much made, because they can only be made with hard 
winter wheat, or softer wheat and plenty of egg. Most Chinese "Egg 
Noodles" are made with yellow dye, not egg.</p>

<p>While the types of noodles used in China, Korea, Japan and Southeast 
Asia do vary with region, as do cooking techniques, we do not separate 
them here by country because each type is too widespread to localize that 
precisely.</p>

   <h3>Cha Soba</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [245; Green Tea Noodles]
   <br><img src="img/pa_245chasoba2d.jpg" alt="Cha Soba 245" class=mrg>
   I've put these soba under wheat because they don't have enough buckwheat 
   to tint them brown. They have barely enough green tea to give them a 
   slightly green tint, but they have a strong green tea aroma.
   Made by Hakubaku Australia, 7-3/4 x 0.040 x 0.065 inches. Ingred: 
   organic wheat flour (95%), organic buckwheat flour (3%), green tea 
   powder (2%), water.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Somen</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [161 Somen (Japan); 
     Somyeon (Korea)]
   <br><img src="img/pa_161somen2d.jpg" alt="Somen 161" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Very popular in Japan, these are very thin wheat noodles usually used 
   in clear soups, added in the last few minutes as they cook very fast.
   Identical noodles are used in Korea, but much more widely, appearing 
   in many both hot and cold dishes.
   Made in Japan, round, 8 x 0.040 inches. Ingred: wheat flour, water, 
   salt.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Ramen</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [377]
   <br><a href="pa_ramenz.html">
   <img src="img/pa_377ram02d.jpg" alt="Ramen noodles 377" class=mrg></a>
   Extremely popular in Japan, these are thin wheat noodles with a 
   spcial formula including Potassium and Sodium Carbonate. These noodles 
   cook in about 8 minutes, but the Carbonates enable them to stay springy, 
   intact, and without swelling for over 20 minutes. This makes them 
   exceptionally suitable for soups.
   7-3/4 x 0.06 inches (197 x 1.5 mm). Wheat flour, water, salt, potassium 
   carbonate, sodium carbonate, beta carotene (color). Made in Japan.

   <h3>Udon, Dried</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [378]
   <br><img src="img/pa_378udo02d.jpg" alt="Ramen noodles 377" class=mrg>
   While fresh Udon are commonly round, dried Udon are more often rectangular. 
   The photo specimens were 7-3/4 x 0.12 x 0.07 inches (200 x 3.0 x 1.8 mm). 
   Made in Japan. Package said to boil 12 minutes, which I find to be the 
   minimum. they were still holding together well at 20 minutes. Ingred: wheat 
   flour, water, salt. 
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Korean Wide Noodles</h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; [343, Chopped noodle]
   <br><img src="img/pa_343koreaw1d.jpg" alt="" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Used much less than the Somen type, this dried noodle imitates the 
   fresh "cut noodles" made in households. Someone with a less than 
   perfect grasp of English named them "Chopped Noodles". 
   Made in Korea, 0.130 x 0.040 inches by 8-5/8 inches long. Ingred: 
   wheat flour, water, salt.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Shanxi Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [232]
   <br><img src="img/pa_232shx01d.jpg" alt="Shanxi Noodles 232" class=mrg>
   These wide noodles are very popular in northern China (Shanxi province 
   is a little southwest of Beijing) They are usually 0.40 inch thick, 
   0.29 inch wide and 7.3 inches long. Wheat flour, salt. Made in China.

   <h3>Ramen Instant Noodles</h3>
   <br><a href="pa_ramenz.html">
   <img src="img/pa_ramenp05h.jpg" alt="Ramen Instant Noodles" class=mrg></a>
   These are most often sold packaged with some broth powder, but are sometimes 
   available without. Most sold in the USA are made in USA, by Japanese 
   companies, and are the same as their Japanese products.

   <br><a href="pa_chthinz.html">
   <img src="img/pa_216chinatd03h.jpg" alt="Chinese Style Thin Noodles 216" class=mrg></a>
   This is one of the most common of the Chinese style "egg" noodles 
   (many of which have yellow dye rather than egg). The FDA used to 
   require these to be labeled "artificial noodle", but now "Asian noodle" 
   or "Chinese style noodle" are accepted, but some still use the old 
   designation. Packed in 1-3/4 ounce skeins of noodles 0.040 inch 
   diameter, made in Hong Kong. Ingred: wheat flour, corn starch, egg, 
   FD&amp;C Yellow #5; alternatively wheat flour, corn starch, egg, lye, 
   water, FD&amp;C Yellow #5. I usually select brands that have actual 
   egg in them. For details see 
   <a href="pa_chthinz.html"><b>Chinese Egg Noodles, Thin</b></a>.

   <h3>Chinese Style, Wide</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [291]
   <br><img src="img/pa_291chinadw1h.jpg" alt="Chinese Style Wide Noodles 291" class=mrg>
   A wider version of Chinese Style "egg" noodles (many of which have 
   yellow dye rather than egg). The FDA used to require these to be 
   labeled "artificial noodle", but now "Asian noodle" or "Chinese style 
   noodle" are accepted, but some still use the old designation. 
   Packed in 1 ounce skeins of noodles 0.12 inch wide and 0.025 inch 
   thick, made in Vietnam. Ingred: wheat flour, egg, water, lye, 
   vegetable oil. I usually select brands that have actual egg in them.

   <h3>Crispy Chow Main Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [341]
   <br><img src="img/pa_341chow2h.jpg" alt="Crispy Chow Main Noodles 341" class=mrg>
   <p>
   These are <u>not authentically Chinese</u>. They probably originated 
   in the United States and are typical of "Chinese-American" restaurants, 
   which serve a cuisine much different from any found in China. They are 
   served as an appetizer, sprinkled over Chinese salads, and sometimes 
   topped with a stir fry with plenty of sauce. 2 inch randoms 0.12 inch 
   diameter; enriched wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt, 
   4% trans fats.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Shanghai Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [351]
   <br><img src="img/pa_351shang2h.jpg" alt="Fresh Shanghai Noodles 351" class=mrg>
   These are popular in Zhejiang province of southeastern China, and are 
   sold fresh in Asian markets. They are about 0.13 inch diameter. Some 
   brands make them rectangular, but I prefer round. They are made up 
   into loose hanks and sold from the refrigerated section. Keep them 
   refrigerated and use within a few days to avoid mold. Cook them by 
   dropping them into rapidly boiling water. When the water is back to 
   a boil, they should be done in between 2 and 4 minutes depending on 
   brand. They should remain chewy. Drain, rinse in cold water and 
   tumble with about 1 t oil per pound to prevent sticking. Wheat flour, 
   water - made in USA. Subst: Japanese fresh Udon noodles of similar 
   size.

   These noodles are very important to Korean cuisine.  They are essential to 
   the famous Korean Japchae dishes, and other Korean specialties. They are 
   much less used in China. The photo specimens, made in China, were 0.06 
   diameter by 22 inches folded length. Ingred: sweet potato starch, sulfur 
   dioxide, water. They cook to a firm gelatinous consistency. Flavor and 
   texture are pleasant and they are much more durable in liquid recipes

   We found these noodles made from starch extracted from bracken fern 
   root in one of the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. 
   Humorously, the designers of the package interpreted the "rn" in 
   "fern" as an "m", so everywhere on the package it says fem instead of 
   fern. Must have been a font problem. The strands were 0.063 inch 
   diameter and 20 inches long, folded in the middle. Cooked, they 
   resemble large, dark colored bean starch noodles, but have a lightly 
   earthy flavor, while bean starch noodles are pretty neutral. These

   These noodles, made in Vietnam, are a bit strange. Just soaked, they 
   have a somewhat unpleasant flavor. Boiled, whether soaked first or 
   not, mere seconds after they are tender they start becoming mush (but 
   the flavor is somewhat better). I can only presume this is supposed 
   to happen to provide a thickening effect in soup they are added to.
   Ingred: pure flour of arrowroot (I presume this actually means 
   arrowroot starch), salt, water. 0.033 diameter, in 1.5 ounce skeins.
