<h1>Chinese Egg Noodles, Thin</h1>
<br><img src="img/pa_216chthin07g.jpg" alt="Fresh &amp; Dry Thin Egg Noodles" class=mrg>
[Artificial Noodles, Asian Noodles]
<p>
This has traditionally been the most common form of Asian noodles in 
North America, usually sold as small skeins of dry noodles. Today they can 
also be found "fresh" in the refrigerated section of any market serving a 
substantial Asian community.</p>

<p>Once labeled "Imitation Noodles", because they didn't fit the 
government's formula for noodles, today they are labeled "Egg Noodles" 
or "Artificial Egg Noodles" (the ones with yellow dye and no egg) or 
"Asian Noodles".</p>

<p>The photo skein of fresh noodles (left), made in California, was 3-7/8 
ounces of noodles 0.045 inch diameter. The dried (right), made in Hong 
Kong, was 1-1/2 ounces of noodles 0.040 inch diameter. The weight of 
skeins is not standard and may vary even in the same package. The fresh 
came in a package of two 3-7/8 ounce skeins and two 6-1/4 ounce skeins.

<p>I prefer the fresh noodles when possible, but the dried keep forever so 
may be all I have on hand. I always try to buy versions with real egg in 
them rather than just yellow dye #5 and #6.</p>

<h3>Technique</h3>

<p>For the most common uses, particularly stir fries, noodles can be 
difficult to handle and will tend to lump up rather than blend with other 
ingredients. Keep in mind you aren't a Southeast Asian street vendor 
who practices 8 hours a day 365 days a year so take all measures to make 
the job easier.</p>

<p>Aside from your wok shovel you want a good, easy to use pair of tongs. 
Once you get the noodles in the pan the wok shovel becomes nearly useless, 
but tongs will help you break up lumps of noodles and get the rest of the 
ingredients spread through.</p>

<p>Taking a couple knife strokes through the pile of noodles before adding, 
to the recipe, so they are about 5 inches long, will also help make them 
manageable, though Asians are resistant to cutting noodles.</p>

<p>Many recipes say to add noodles (soaked or fresh) without pre-cooking. I 
find this a very bad policy. It makes it impossible to accurately 
judge the amount of liquid you need in the recipe, and you can't accurately 
judge what weight of noodles you'll end up with. If it's too much, well, 
it's too late now. Also texture and flavor come out better pre-cooked.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of pre-cooking, though, is you can have the noodles 
in the pan the minimum amount of time needed to mix and warm - then get them 
out before they all stick to the pan and break up into mush.</p>
<br>

<h2>Fresh</h2> 

<p>These would more accurately be described as "semi-dry". The photo specimen 
skein was made in California from enriched flour, fresh eggs, water, salt, 
potassium sorbate and artificial color FD&amp;C Yellow 
#5.</p>

<p><b>Buying &amp; Storage:</b> &nbsp; Find them in the refrigerated section 
of markets serving an Asian community.  Refrigerated in their unopened 
package they will keep a couple weeks to a month but will eventually succumb 
to mold. Once the package is opened, even if resealed, they'll become moldy 
within a week.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Bring salted water to a boil as for any other 
pasta. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, drain. Since this will normally be done 
a little ahead you need to keep the noodles from sticking together. 
Chinese cookbooks usually say to rinse them with cold water but I prefer 
to tumble them with just a bit of oil - and reduce the oil in the recipe 
by the same amount.</p>

<p><b>Yield</b> &nbsp; A 4 ounce skein will cook to 11.4 ounces (285%).
</p>
<br>

<h2>Dried</h2>

<p>The photo specimen skein was made in Hong Kong from flour, cornstarch, 
egg, lye water and FD&amp;C Yellow #5.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Soak the noodles in warm (not hot) water for about 
20 minutes or until softened through. Drain.  Bring salted water to a boil 
as for any other pasta. Cook for 3 minutes, drain. Since this will normally 
be done a little ahead you need to keep the noodles from sticking together. 
Chinese cookbooks usually say to rinse them with cold water but I prefer 
to tumble them with just a bit of oil - and reduce the oil in the recipe 
by the same amount.</p>


<p><b>Yield</b> &nbsp; A 2 ounce skein, soaked and cooked, will weigh 
about 7.7 ounces (385%)</p>
