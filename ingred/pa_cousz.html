Couscous is a form of pasta made of hard wheat formed into grains or beads 
of various sizes. In some small regions of North Africa couscous is made from 
pearl millet or barley rather than hard wheat.A West African variety called 
<i>Atti&eacute;k&eacute;</i> is made from cassava and in Brazil couscous is 
made from pre-cooked flakes of sweetcorn.</p>

<p>The tiny bits to the left in the photo are North African couscous - size 
moyen (medium). The photo specimens were made in Marrakech, Morocco and the 
grains are typically 0.06 inch / 1.5 mm. This form is traditionally made by 
rolling moistened semolina between the hands and sieving the result until a 
uniform size is obtained. It is always steamed, never boiled.</p>

<p>The two at the right are Levantine pearl couscous. This type is often 
erroneously called "Israeli couscous" which name properly belongs to a rice 
grain shape unique to Israel (a rice replacement product that largely 
failed). The pearl shape is indigenous to Lebanon and Jordan. The small 
(about 0.14 inch / 3.5 mm), called "maftoul" were made in Jordan. The 
larger (about 0.22 inch / 5.5 mm), called "moghrabieh" were made in 
Lebanon. These forms are boiled or used in soups and stews like regular 
pasta rather than steamed.</p>

<p>Packaged couscous preparations sold in markets in the US are always 
made up with "instant couscous". It is similar to the North African in 
form but pre-steamed and dried so it cooks in 5 minutes by adding boiling 
water. The result, as you might expect, is inferior to the real thing.</p>

<p>Hungarian <a href="../recipes/oii_tarhonya1.html">Tarhonya</a> is 
sometimes labeled "couscous" but it is normally formed by grating a ball of 
dough, not by rolling as proper couscous is.

<p><b>Buying & Storing</b> &nbsp; Supermarkets in the US generally carry 
boxed preparations based on "instant couscous". For real couscous check 
ethnic markets serving communities from the Middle East. The photo 
specimens were all purchased at a market in Los Angeles that serves 
communities from the Middle East, India, Persia, Armenia, Southern Russia 
and Mexico.</p>
<p>Store couscous in tightly sealed containers away from moisture or 
excessive heat and it should be fine for several years.</p>

<b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; The traditional device for cooking North African 
couscous is the  <i>kiskas</i> (<i>couscousiere</i>). An aromatic stew 
(<i>Tagine</i>) is cooked in the bottom pot and the couscous is cooked in the 
steamer pan on top. Other forms of steamer can also be used in a pinch.
