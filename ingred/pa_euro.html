<h1>European Pasta <small>&amp;</small> Noodles</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
This page covers pasta and noodles other than those made in 
Italy. <a href="pa_ital.html">Italian Pasta &amp; Noodles</a> has its 
own page. While some primitive forms may have come from elsewhere, the 
main pasta influence in Europe was Italy. Unlike Italy, the rest of 
Europe doesn't have laws specifying that pasta <u>must</u> be made from 
durum wheat semolina. This opens the door for pasta made from high 
gluten bread wheat, with some pretty good results, and some not so good.

<h2>General &amp; History</h2>

<p>The history of pasta and noodles is covered in detail on our 
pages <a href="pa_nood.html"><b>Pasta &amp; Noodles</b></a> and 
<a href="pa_ital.html"><b>Italian Pasta</b></a>. Suffice to say here, 
real Pasta didn't come from China - dried noodles originated from the 
Arabs, and real pasta, made from hard winter wheat, probably originated 
from Sicily.</p>

<p>European pastas and noodles are all wheat based, except perhaps 
a few specialty items for the "gluten free" market.</p><br>


<h2 id="hung">Hungary</h2>

<p>Instructions for making the fresh products shown below will be found 
at <a href="../recipes/oii_tarhonya1.html">Hungarian Fresh Pasta</a>.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind><br></td><td>

   <h3>Aproteszta</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [211; Lebbencs Leves Teszta 
     (Hungarian), Broad Noodles]
   <br><img src="img/pa_211aproteszta1h.jpg" alt="Aproteszta Squares 211" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Not sure yet how these are used. The photo specimens were typically 
   4.5 inches square and 0.40 inch thick.  Ingred: wheat flour, eggs.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Csiga Teszta</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [212]
   <br><img src="img/pa_212csiga1h.jpg" alt="Csiga Teszta 212" class=mrg>
   These are a screw shaped soup noodle. The photo specimens were 
   0.13 inch diameter and 0.53 inch randoms in length. Ingred: flour 
   and/or semolina, whole eggs.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Csipetke</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [034]
   <br><img src="img/pa_034csipetke5h.jpg" alt="Csipetke 034" class=mrg>
   These are used in stews, generally fresh, but they can be dried. 
   They are somewhat more substantial than Tarhonia. They are easy to 
   make, you just make a ball of dough and pinch off pieces, flattening 
   them between your fingers. Ingred: flour, egg, salt.
   <br class=cll><p></p>


   <h3>Egg Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [228]
   <br><img src="img/pa_228noodl6h.jpg" alt="Egg Noodles 228" class=mrg>
   Fresh egg noodles are used in many Hungarian dishes. They are easy 
   to make. You just roll out a ball of dough as thin as you can get 
   it and cut into the size ribbons you want. They should dry for 1/2 
   hour before cooking. Ingred: flour, eggs, salt.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Galuska</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [227]
   <br><img src="img/pa_227galuska5h.jpg" alt="Galuska Dumplings 227" class=mrg>
   These dumplings are used in many Hungarian dishes, generally made 
   fresh. Making them is easy. A ball of dough is rolled out to about 
   1/2 inch thick, then the dumplings are cut off from it using a spoon 
   or some similar cutter. Ingred: flour, egg, salt.
   <p>Today, smaller Galuska or Nokedli may be used, similar to the German 
   Sp&auml;etzle. Incidently, the spoon method was an old method for 
   making sp&auml;etzle in German homes, thus "sp&auml;etzle" (little 
   sparrows). Well, that's one theory, anyway.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Sz&eacute;lesmet&eacute;lt </h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     [215; Broad Noodles]
   <br><img src="img/pa_215hbroad1d.jpg" alt="Sz&eacute;lesmet&eacute;lt 215" class=mrg>
   These are made of soft wheat flour, and are very fragile. The photo 
   specimens were typically 0.185 inch wide, 0.025 inch thick and 6.5 
   inches long.  Ingred: flour, egg.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Tarhonia</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [033; Rivilchas, Egg 
     Barley]
   <br><img src="img/pa_033tarhonia5h.jpg" alt="Tarhonia 033" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is a very important noodle in Hungary. It was formally made by 
   families by the sack full, dried and stored for the winter. It is 
   used in soups, stews and with sauce. They are available commercially, 
   but better made at home. It's easy, you just make a ball of dough and 
   grate it on the coarse side of a box grater. The photo specimens show 
   freshly home made on the left, and packaged commercial on the right. 
   Ingred: flour, egg, salt.

there.</p>

   <h3>Polish Thin Egg Noodles</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [213]
   <br><img src="img/pa_213pthinegg2h.jpg" alt="Thin Polish Egg Noodles 213" class=mrg>
    <p>
    Labeled as Niteczki domowe (rolled macaroni) these are cut egg 
    noodles 0.55 x 0.45 inch by 1-3/4 inch randoms. The cook very fast, 
    3 to 4 minutes. Ingred: Flour 500 (all purpose flour), egg (4.8%), 
    water, curcuman (turmeric).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Polish Curls</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [234]
   <br><img src="img/pa_234pcurls2h.jpg" alt="Polish Pasta Curles 234" class=mrg>
   These are made of bread flour, so their cooking and eating properties 
   are more like egg noodles. The photo specimens were typically 0.380 
   inch diameter and 1.5 inch random lengths.  Ingred: wheat flour 
   (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), water, seasoning. I suspect the 
   seasoning is turmeric for color, as egg is not indicated.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Polish Dischi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [236]
   <br><img src="img/pa_236pthim06h.jpg" alt="Polish Dischi 236" class=mrg>
   These are made with the standard Italian Dischi die, but are made 
   of bread flour, so their cooking and eating properties are more like 
   egg noodles. The photo specimens were typically 0.8 inch diameter.  
   Ingred: wheat flour (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), water, seasoning. 
   I suspect the seasoning is turmeric for color, as egg is not indicated.
   <br class=cll><p></p>
  
   <h3>Polish Lasagnetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [233]
   <br><img src="img/pa_233plasagnetti2h.jpg" alt="Polish Lasagnetti 233" class=mrg>
   These are made with the standard Italian Lasagnetti die, but are made 
   of bread flour, so their cooking and eating properties are more like 
   egg noodles. The photo specimens were typically 0.32 inch thick, 
   0.75 inch wide and 1.5 inches long.  Ingred: wheat flour 
   (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), water, seasoning. I suspect the seasoning 
   is turmeric for color, as egg is not indicated.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Polish Nuvole</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [264]
   <br><img src="img/pa_264pnuvole2h.jpg" alt="Polish Nuvole 264" class=mrg>
   These are made with the standard Italian Nuvole die, but are made 
   of bread flour, so their cooking and eating properties are more like 
   egg noodles. The package suggests serving with cabbage and mushrooms, 
   but I'm sure they would go very well with a popular Polish dish of 
   noodles and cabbage with sour cream and garnished with butter fried 
   breadcrumbs. The photo specimens were typically 0.32 inch thick, 
   0.7 inch wide and 0.8 inch long.  Ingred: wheat flour, water, 
   vitamin A.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Polish Squares</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [337]
   <br><img src="img/pa_337polsq01h.jpg" alt="Polish Squares 337" class=mrg>
   I have no idea yet how these are used in Poland. The photo specimens 
   were typically 0.33 inch thick, 0.80 inch wide and 0.97 inch long.  
   Ingred: pasta flour, water, turmeric.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Polish Half Culverts</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [338]
   <br><img src="img/pa_338polhp01h.jpg" alt="Polish Half Culverts 338" class=mrg>
   These resemble a half section of corrigated steel culvert piping. 
   They cooked well, and with this shape, they are very good at holding 
   sauces. The photo specimens were typically 0.33 inch thick, 0.97 inch 
   long and 0.54 inch wide.  Ingred: pasta flour, water, turmeric.

   <h3>Egg Noodle Shapes</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [330]
   <br><img src="img/pa_330lithm1h.jpg" alt="Lithuanian Egg Noodle Shapes 330" class=mrg>
   Lithuania is currently exporting egg noodle shapes to North America, 
   both short and long shapes. Like their neighbors, the Poles, these 
   shapes are made with traditional Italian dies, but are egg noodles 
   rather than duram wheat pasta. Egg noodles are much more popular in the 
   region and work well with the sauces used there (primarily butter 
   and sour cream). Those I've tried have been of very high quality and 
   hold together well in cooking. The tubular one is cellentini.  
   I haven't identified the Italian die for the other, but it looks 
   like a mushroom. It is a particularly good shape with just butter, 
   salt and pepper.

   <br><img src="img/pa_323spaetzle2h.jpg" alt="Sp&auml;etzle 323" class=mrg>
   This is the pasta of Germany. It is properly made fresh, squeezed 
   through the holes of a sp&auml;etzle maker directly into boiling 
   water, but some is made dried for sale in North America. Those 
   shown in the photo, typically 0.25 inch diameter randoms, are direct 
   from the cold water quench. They are then fried in butter, either to 
   just warm, or lightly browned. See our recipe 
   <a href="../recipes/esn_spaetzle1.html">Sp&auml;etzle</a> recipe 
   for all the details.

   <h3>Bandnudeln</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [262]
   <br><img src="img/pa_262bandnudln2h.jpg" alt="Bandnudeln 262" class=mrg>
   These standard medium egg noodles are exactly what you'd expect from 
   well made egg noodles, though made by the same company that made those 
   strange Spiralnudln described below. The photo specimens were 
   typically 3.25 inches long, 0.22 inch wide and 0.030 inch thick. 
   Ingred: wheat flour, eggs (20%), water.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Egg Noodles, Extra Broad</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [239]
   <br><img src="img/pa_239extwide2h.jpg" alt="Egg Noodles, Extra Broad 239" class=mrg>
   These noodles are actually egg pasta, made out of durum wheat. As 
   such they have a firmer, less elastic texture and a less sweet taste 
   than regular egg noodles. The photo specimens were typically 3 inches 
   long, 0.43 inch wide and 0.035 inch thick. Ingred: durum  wheat 
   semolina, eggs.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Egg Noodles, Thin Soup</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [240]
   <br><img src="img/pa_240thinsoup1h.jpg" alt="Very thin Egg Noodles 240" class=mrg>
   These noodles are actually egg pasta, made out of durum wheat. As 
   such they have a firmer, less elastic texture and a less sweet taste 
   than regular egg noodles. These are very similar to Italian rotini. 
   The photo specimens were typically 2-1/2 inch random lengths and 
   0.035 inch thick. Ingred: durum  wheat semolina, eggs.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Rotini with Egg</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [238]
   <br><img src="img/pa_238grotini3h.jpg" alt="Rotini with Egg 238" class=mrg>
   These noodles are actually egg pasta, made out of durum wheat. 
   The photo specimens were typically 0.325 inch diameter and 1.75 
   inches long. Ingred: durum  wheat semolina, eggs.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Spiralnudeln</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [243]
   <br><img src="img/pa_243rotinik2h.jpg" alt="Spiralnudeln 243" class=mrg>
   These are definitely one of the strangest noodles I've encountered. 
   Long before they are done, the outer edge of the fins has separated 
   into a fine thread, intertangled with the spiral. By time the spiral 
   is done, these threads are badly overcooked. Is this accidental, or 
   an example of German pasta engineering gone bonkers? The photo 
   specimens were typically 0.5 inch diameter and 1.8 inches long. 
   Although in the standard rotini pasta form, they are actually egg 
   noodles made of bread flour, and have the taste and texture of egg 
   noodles. Ingred: wheat flour, eggs (20%), water.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>German Funghetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [342]
   <br><img src="img/pa_342fungg03h.jpg" alt="German Funghetti 342" class=mrg>
   In the shape of little mushrooms, these noodles are actually egg 
   pasta, made out of durum wheat. They cook very well, but have a 
   somewhat smoother, more resilient bite. They are somewhat larger 
   than Italian Funghetti I have found to date.
   The photo specimens were typically 0.75 inch diameter and 0.60 
   inch high. Ingred: durum wheat semolina, cage free eggs.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Little Pockets</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [359]
   <br><img src="img/pa_359lpock1h.jpg" alt="German Little Pockets Pasta 359" class=mrg>
   These noodles are actually egg pasta, made out of durum wheat and 
   cage-free eggs. They cook very well, but have a somewhat smoother, 
   more resilient bite than Italian pasta. The photo specimens were 
   typically 1.97 inches long (5 cm). Product of Germany - durum wheat 
   semolina, cage free eggs.

   <br><img src="img/pa_214fmacaroni2h.jpg" alt="Macaronade 214" class=mrg>
   These long macaronis were made in Provence, France, which is where 
   they are traditional, often served with beef that has been stewed in 
   red wine. Hollow tubes 0.165 inch diameter, 2 inch random lengths. 
   Ingred: durum wheat.
   <p>This pasta can be very hard to find in North America. When I can't 
   replenish my supply I break up Mezzanelli into 2 inch lengths. It's 
   0.175 inch diameter, so it's only 1/100th inch larger, but it is 
   straight rather than curved. When I can't find that either, I use 
   Greek Pastichio (the large size - see below), which is identical.

<h2 id="greek">Greece</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Orzo, for soup and salad, and Pastitsio for oven baked dishes 
dominate pasta usage in Greece, but some other Italian style shapes 
are also used. As in Turkey, the Greeks like their pasta cooked all 
the way through rather than <i>al dente</i>. Not mushy, mind you, 
but with no stiff center.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind><br></td><td>

   <h3>Orzo, Large</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [287]
   <br><img src="img/pa_287orzog1h.jpg" alt="Greek Orzo 287" class=mrg>
   Orzo is a very popular pasta in Greece due to its use in many 
   salads. The photo specimens were 0.48 inch long, 0.090 inch wide and 
   0.090 inch thick. A bit longer and narrower than our Italian specimens.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Pastitsio - small</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [237 Pastichio]
   <br><img src="img/pa_237past01d.jpg" alt="Small Pastitsio 237" class=mrg>
   These are used for making the popular Greek dish pastitsio, 
   though the larger size (#327) may be preferred. This pasta is pretty 
   much identical to the Italian bucatini. The photo specimens, Monastiri 
   brand, were 10 inches long, 0.11 inches diameter and hollow. Ingred: 
   durum wheat semolina.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Pastitsio - large</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [327 Pastichio]
   <br><img src="img/pa_327pasti02d.jpg" alt="Large Pastitsio 327" class=mrg>
   These are, I believe, the preferred pasta for use in making the popular 
   Greek dish pastitsio, though larger tubular pastas are 
   often substituted. That the entire package was in Greek with no 
   English or Italian suggests authenticity. They are pretty much 
   identical to the Italian Mezzanelli and Regine. The photo specimens, 
   Misko brand, were 10 inches long, 0.175 inches diameter and hollow.  
   Ingred: durum wheat semolina.

   I don't know how popular corn pasta actually is in Rumania, but it is 
   definitely made there. This spaghetti was "private label" packaged 
   for Trader Joes as one of their "gluten free" offerings. Cooked, it 
   was more like regular wheat pasta than I expected. Of course, both 
   flavor and texture were a little different. The package says to cook 
   "for 8 minutes or until desired tenderness". I found desired 
   tenderness at about 15 minutes. The photo specimens were 10.2 inches

   Cooked, it was more like regular wheat pasta than I expected. Of 
   course, both flavor and texture were a little different. The package

<h2 id="armo">Armenia</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Until 2018, the only "Armenian" pasta easily available here in 
Los Angeles was the thin, cut "Vermicelli" used to make rice and 
pasta pilafs. It was very popular, and all the multi-ethnic markets 
stocked piles of it. In late 2018, a number of other Armenian pastas 
started to show up, and we have listed those here.</p>

   <h3>Vermicelli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [218; Tell Shehrich (Armenian)]
   <br><img src="img/pa_218vermi2h.jpg" alt="Tell Shehrich 218" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This form of pasta is very popular in Armenia, and has spread through 
   the Near East. The multi-ethnic markets here in Los Angeles are 
   heavily stocked with packages of this pasta due to high demand from 
   our large Armenian population, who use it for rice and vermicelli 
   pilafs. These pilafs were, in fact, the inspiration for creation of 
   the Rice-a-Roni product line by an Italian pasta making family. This 
   pasta is about 0.04 inch diameter, usually cut to about 0.9 inch 
   long. This is about the same thickness as Italian Capellini. Product 
   of USA.

   <br><img src="img/pa_357vermt01h.jpg" alt="Toasted vermicelli #357" class=mrg>
   <p>This is the same as the regular Vermicelli, but toasted. Toasted 
   pasta is very popular in Armenia. This pasta is about 0.06 inch

   <p>I suspect these tubular pastas are partially cooked and then 
   combined with vegetables and sauce in a casserole, similar to dishes 
   of medium tubular pastas in Greece and Turkey. 7 x 0.31 inches. 
   Product of Armenia - wheat flour, water, salt.

<h2 id="turk">Turkey</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Turkish pasta usage is quite similar to that of Greece. A number of 
Italian style shapes are used. Note that, like the Greeks, the Turks 
like their pasta cooked all the way through rather than <i>al dente</i>. 
Not mushy, mind you, but no stiff center.</p>
<p>I'll have more on the subject of Turkish pasta when I get a little 
study time.</p>

<h2 id="mex">Mexico</h2>
<p></p>

<p>OK, Mexico isn't exactly Europe, but we're putting it here anyway, at 
least until we find a reason to have a separate Americas page. Mexicans 
use quite a few normal Italian shapes, particularly soup shapes, many 
manufactured in Mexico, but below are items that are unique.</p>

   <h3>Duros / Duros de Rueda</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [332]
   <br><img src="img/pa_332duro3e.jpg" alt="Duros and Duros de Rueda" class=mrg>
   These shapes are deep fried, which causes them to puff up like Asian 
   rice noodles do. They are sort of vegetarian chicharr&oacute;nes, 
   but a little less healthy then hog hides. They have about the same 
   amount of oil (a lot less than potato chips in both cases) but are 
   all carbohydrates while hog hides are mostly protein.  Once puffed, 
   they are usually seasoned with lemon salt and dipped into chili 
   sauces and the like.
   <p>The flat ones were 3.58 inches long, 2.58 
   inches across and 0.10 inch thick (across the ridge points - much 
   thinner in the lands). The wheels (Rueda) were 1.17 inches diameter 
   and 0.08 inch thick. Ingred: wheat flour, salt, corn starch, 
   bicarbonate of soda, vegetable oil, food coloring.</p>
   <p>I discovered these in my vegetarian days, and didn't find out what 
   you are supposed to do with them until many years later. I found the 
   flat ones useful for adding flavor to vegetarian soup stocks, fishing 
   them out before they started to disintegrate, kind of like how the 
   Japanese use kelp.
