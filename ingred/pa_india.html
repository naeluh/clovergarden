<h1>Indian Noodles <small>&amp;</small> Dumplings</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
India is not known as a land of noodles, but it has traded with 
the Middle East, China, Southeast Asia Europe and Africa for thousands of 
years, and been exposed to noodles from all directions. Indian noodles 
may be made of wheat, rice or millet. They are used in a number of dishes 
very popular in India, particularly for breakfasts and deserts. We are 
also including here some small dried "noodle-like" dumplings widely 
used in India.</span>

<h3>Sevai</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [009 Shyavige]
<br><img src="img/pa_009ricestk10d.jpg" alt="Sevai Rice Noodles 009" class=mrg>
In southern India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, rice noodles are often made 
fresh. That's a bit of a hassle here, especially since the necessary wet 
grinders, while common in Indian households, are scarce and expensive 
here in California. A powerful blender could be used, but the result 
isn't quite the same. Here, we can just use easily available Asian dried 
rice noodles, available in numerous sizes. Also, fresh rice noodles in 
sheets and wider sizes are available in Southeast Asian and Korean 
markets. 
<p>The photo shows the thinnest (0.027 inch / 0.75 mm diameter), but 
thicker ones are often used in India. Just make sure you get rice 
noodles, not bean starch noodles - they look identical dried, but 
nothing alike when cooked. Rice noodles are often used for breakfast 
dishes, but can appear in other roles as well. They are often flavored 
with tamarind, lemon, coconut, and spices.

<h3>Seviyan</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [036 Xevaiyan, "Vermicelli"]
<br><img src="img/pa_036capellini1g.jpg" alt="Seviyan 036" class=mrg>
This durum wheat noodle is often called "vermicelli" in English, but 
differs from both Italian vermicelli, which is a little lager than 
spaghetti, and American vermicelli, which is a bit smaller than 
spaghetti. This pasta is more equivalent to Capellini (angel hair) 
in size (0.040 inch / 1.0 mm) and is identical in diameter to the 
"vermicelli" so popular in Armenia.
<p>This pasta isn't much shipped from India, and why would it be when 
Capellini is so easily available in North America? In most Indian 
recipes, it is broken to 2 or 3 inches and roasted in oil with spices 
until a light golden color before adding liquids. In India it is also 
sold "pre roasted". It is used for breakfast dishes, usually cooked 
with water, and for sweet desert dishes, usually cooked with milk.

<h3>Wadi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [339 Vadi, Bori, Bodi, Mungaudi]
<br><img src="img/pa_339wadi01d.jpg" alt="Wadi 339" class=mrg>
These dumplings can serve as a meat substitute in recipes. No, they're 
not just like meat, but can take it's place similarly to textured soy 
protein, and they are probably a lot healthier than the heavily processed 
soy.  They are made of various mixes of ground pulses, and formed in 
various shapes. They are particularly popular in northern India, where 
they are made in the winter and sun dried for use the rest of the year. 
If dried in the hot summer sun they get too hard and don't cook right.
<p>Those on the left are Chora Wadi, made from small dark green chickpeas 
(peeled), and those on the right are made are Moong Wadi, made from mung 
beans (peeled). Urad dal is also often used. The chana are about 
0.55 inch diameter at the base, and the Moong about 0.63 inch diameter 
at the base. Both were purchased from a large Indian market in 
Glendale, California.
