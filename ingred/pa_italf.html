<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Fresh pasta is neither better nor worse than dried pasta - it is 
different, and needs different saucing. While dried pasta is firm and 
chewy, fresh pasta is soft and delicate.</span>
<p><span class=bg>Fresh pasta is more typical of Northern Italy than in 
the south, but even in the north is no longer a daily ritual.  Because 
it takes time and work, it is generally reserved for special occasions 
and special dishes.</span></p>

<h2 id="tool">Tools for Making Fresh Pasta</h2>

<p>The essential tools are illustrated in the photo at the top of this 
page. </p>
<ul>
<li>A sturdy working surface. In this case a 2 foot square sheet of 3/4 
  inch plywood, the surface rubbed with mineral oil. That's about the 
  minimum size that will be usable.</li>
<li>A rolling pin. The type shown is an Italian pasta pin. It is straight, 
  1.6 inches diameter with no taper and a working length of 18.5 inches. 
  This is about the minimum useful length. The big pasta mamas in Italy 
  use pins over 3 feet long. The knobs on the ends serve no purpose and 
  could be cut off. The tapered French style will work fine if you 
  will be using a pasta machine, but not for hand rolling - the reason 
  is stretching, explained below. The fat ones with handles at the ends 
  may work for pie crust, but not for pasta.</li>
<li>A dough scraper, needed for keeping the work surface clear of 
  dough fragments and the like. It can also serve for cutting pasta.
  Mine is also ruled in inches and centimeters which is quite convenient.
  </li>
<li>Various cutters, straight and wavy.</li>
<li>A pastry brush (a natural bristle paint brush about 1-1/4 inches 
  wide) is fine.</li>
<li>A drying rack for long pasta. My rack (pictured below) is a length 
  of Cat-5e network cable stretched between two hooks. Actually, the data 
  rate for this application is very low, so Cat-3 cable would work fine.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/ke_pastamach01e.jpg" alt="Pasta Machine" class=mrg>
There is also a device that may not be essential, but you will most 
certainly want one - the Pasta Machine. Rolling out pasta with a rolling 
pin is certainly doable, and will serve to build immensely strong hands, 
arms and shoulders, but it is rather a lot of work and takes a lot of 
time. These machines can be had at quite reasonable prices. The one in 
the photo was about 2012 US $34.</p>
<p>The front section with the crank in it rolls the dough progressively 
thinner, thinner than you can do with a rolling pin, and fast! The 
removable upper section is a dual cutting unit for spaghetti and 
fettucini. Other cutter units are available, but none are essential. 
Of course, you still need the rolling pin to get things started.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/ke_paraviol02k.jpg" alt="Ravioli Mold" class=mrg>
This Norpro Ravioli mold is very popular, but I'm not entirely thrilled 
with it. It does get quite a lot of filling in each cell, but the cells 
tend to have a lot of air in them, and there's no way to squeeze it out. 
The ravioli are also quite prone to damage or bursting, and you still 
often have to cut them apart with the wavy cutter.</p> 
<p>The traditional method is to cut ribbons twice as long as wide. Fill 
and fold over. I usually cut the ribbons with a straight cutter, then 
use the wavy blade to trim the three sealed edges real nice.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="make">Making Fresh Pasta</h2>

<p><img src="img/pa_fresh02h.jpg" alt="Flour with Eggs" class=mrg>
There are two basic recipes for fresh pasta in Italy. The first is used 
in most of Italy, the second in Emilia-Romagna. The recipe with oil is 
considered a little easier to work with. Each of these will make 
about 2 pounds of dough.

<ol>
<li>So, to get started you make a pile of flour with a well in the 
center sufficient to hold the eggs and oil (if used). The picture shows 
whole eggs, but for manageability I recommend beating them lightly with 
a fork before adding to the flour. Don't break eggs over the flour like 
you see in photos or you'll get lots of shell fragments ruining your 
pasta sheets.</li>
<li>With a fork, start working flour from the walls into the eggs. 
To prevent any egg from escaping, work the wall with your free hand. 
Eventually the fork will get bogged down. Scrape accumulated dough 
of into the well and start massaging it all together with your hands.
</li>
<li>Ok, yes, I cheat. I let my big Kitchen Aid mixer with it's dough 
hook do this work. I use 3 cups flour, 3 eggs, and dribble in a few 
tablespoons of water as needed. When it is nearly making a ball, I 
take the dough out and massage it into a ball by hand.</li>
<li>Once you have a ball, use your pastry scraper to clean the board. 
It's time to knead the dough, but you don't want to knead it a whole 
lot or you'll end up with a tough ball and tough pasta. Knead just 
enough to organize the ball. and get it reasonably smooth. Start 
working the dough with the heels of your hands, from the center out, 
then folding and working some more. If when you fold it, the two sides 
don't stick, wet your hand and wipe the side you're folding in. If the 
ball is too sticky, dust it very lightly with some sifted flour. What you 
want is a ball that sticks together well but doesn't stick to anything 
else.</li>
<li>Flatten the dough ball a bit and cut it into equal pieces. For 
machine rolling, 1 piece for every cup of flour. For hand rolling you 
can make the pieces a little bigger.  Work with one piece at a time, 
keeping the others covered in plastic wrap or under a damp towel so 
they won't dry out.</li>
<li>Mold a piece, round if you will be rolling out by hand, rectangular 
if you will be using a machine. Roll it out as thin as you can get it 
if rolling by hand. The example in the photo was rolled to 0.032 inch 
thick, which is rather thick for fresh pasta, but it didn't want to 
get any thinner.</li>
<li>To go thinner you need a real Italian pasta pin (or similar wooden 
cylinder about 1-3/4 inch diameter) - it's long, straight and with no 
taper. Make sure the pasta slides well on the board. Start rolling up 
the pasta around the pin, but as you roll, stretch the pasta out both 
ways parallel to the pin by stroking it with your hands. Roll over 
it before it has time to pull back. Once it's all rolled up with the 
stretch locked in, unroll it rotated 45&deg;. Repeat until it is as 
thin as it should be.</li>
<li><h3>If using a machine</h3>, you want to roll out your 
lump of pasta flat enough and narrow enough to go through the rollers 
at the widest setting. Run it through. Note that this is easiest done 
by two people, one keeping the dough feeding in straight and turning 
the crank, the other guiding it out at the bottom.</li>
<li>Once it's rolled, fold the sides in as thirds, overlapping in the 
manner of a letter. Next fold in thirds the other way, bringing in the 
ends to make it shorter. The objective here is to make it rectangular 
with straight sides. Dust very lightly with flour, then use the rolling 
pin to get it back sufficiently thin to be gripped by the rollers. Roll 
it across rather than lengthwise as much as needed to get it to 3/4 
the width of the machine. The machine will make it much longer but not 
much wider. 
</li>
<li>Roll again and repeat the folding and flattening if needed.</li>
<li>Now turn the rollers closer by one notch and roll it through 
again. It will get quite a bit longer but not much wider. Repeat, 
closing by one notch each time until the thickness is less than 0.030 
inch. My machine is about 0.030 inch at "3", 0.020 at "2" and 0.015 at 
"1", but different machines vary. I usually roll to "2". Fresh pasta 
should be thinner than dried pasta due to cooking characteristics.</li>
<li>Note that, after running through at "4" I cut the strip in half so 
it's more manageable, then roll each half to "2".</li>
<li>Once you have a lump rolled out, you should cut it or shape and 
stuff it immediately, but if you do need a little time you can dust 
it very lightly with flour and interleave with wax paper, making sure 
it's not exposed to air or it will harden. The best way to dust is to 
dip a natural bristle paint / pastry brush in flour and "paint" the 
pasta, brushing off until there is only a faint trace of flour, then 
flip and paint the other side. Without the flour dusting it will even 
stick to wax paper fairly quickly. If all goes wrong, you can wad it 
up and send it back through the machine.</li>
<li>If you cut into noodles, hang them to dry on a pasta rack or 
some similar scheme, or lay out on a clean towel - <b>do not let them 
touch and stick to each other</b>. They will not become unstuck in 
cooking and will remain hard wherever they are stuck together. Even if 
you will cook them right away, they should be dried for fifteen to 20 
minutes.</li>

<h2 id="store">Storing Fresh Pasta</h2>

<p>Fresh pasta can be dried, refrigerated or frozen. If dried it will 
be very fragile compared to regular dried pasta.  Refrigerated, pasta 
will last for about 5 days, frozen for two months or so.</p>
<p>To prepare for refrigeration or freezing, pasta needs to be at least 
"flash cooked" to keep it from sticking together - or you will have a 
horrible mess. Bring a lot of water to a rolling boil. Drop the pasta in 
for just 20 seconds, then scoop out and plunge into cold water to stop 
the cooking. Drain well, bag with all air squeezed out, and store. If 
frozen, the pieces will freeze to each other, but will separate 
as soon as plunged into boiling water.</p>
<p>Pasta to be baked, such as lasagna or cannelloni, can be cooked 
3 minutes, then drain well and store in a container with each piece 
separated from the others with waxed paper. refrigerate or freeze.</p>
<p>OK, those are the official methods, but that's not how I freeze pasta. 
I lay out a sheet of thin plastic on a baking sheet that fits in the 
freezer compartment, then place pasta pieces on it in a single layer. 
There's so little water in the pasta it freezes up sufficient for bagging 
within 20 minutes or so. This way all the pasta pieces are completely 
separate and you can remove just as many as you wish.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="cook">Cooking Fresh Pasta</h2>

<p>The general rules are exactly as for dried pasta (see 
<a href="pastaw.html#cook"><b>Cooking Pasta</b></a>) but the timing 
will be much different</p>
<p>If the fresh pasta has had only 15 to 20 minutes of air drying, and 
is 0.020 inch thick or less, it will probably be done within a minute 
of the water coming back to a boil.</p>
<p>If it is thicker, or stuffed, or has had more drying time, it can 
take quite a bit longer. Try samples while cooking just as with regular 
pasta.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="shape">Fresh <small>and</small> Stuffed Pasta Shapes</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Numbers:</h3> &nbsp; The numbers given here are Clovegarden numbers 
and have no relation to any Italian designations.<p></p>

<h3>Agnolotti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [193]
<br>Stuffed pasta squares with rippled edges on three sides and a fold 
on the fourth.<p></p>

<h3 id=314>Anolini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [314]
  <br><img src="img/pa_314anolinif2h.jpg" alt="Semicircles" width="220" height="219" class=mrg>
  These are an easy to make fresh stuffed pasta, just a circle punched 
  out with rippled edges folded over.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Cannelloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [321]
  <br><img src="img/pa_321cannellonif2e.jpg" alt="Long tubes" width="260" height="165" class=mrg>
  In North America, Cannelloni are most often dried pasta tubes, cooked, 
  stuffed and baked with sauce. In Italy they are often made fresh, and 
  rather than a stuffed tube they are often made up like a jelly roll. 
  The photo specimens, rolled up with a meat filling spread on them, 
  were 5.25 inches long. The original dimensions were 4.0 x 5.0 inches, 
  but the 4.0 inch dimension became 5.25 inches after cooking. About 
  2 Tablespoons of filling was spread on each one before rolling.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Cappelletti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [311; Alpine Hats]
  <br><img src="img/pa_311cappellettif3h.jpg" alt="Pasta Hats" width="220" height="180" class=mrg>
  <p> 
  These are made from 2 to 2-1/2 inch squares of fresh pasta folded 
  around stuffing into a triangle. The apex of the triangle is then 
  folded down over the flat side and the points brought together across 
  the stuffed side. They are very much like Tortellini, but from a square 
  rather than a circle. The photo specimens were made from 2-1/2 inch 
  squares (because that's half the web width of my pasta machine) and 
  the finished product is about 1.0 inch diameter and 0.75 inch high.
  These are generally stuffed with meat or cheese, and may be served 
  with the broth they are cooked in or with various sauces.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Egg Noodles</h3>
  <br>In Italy, egg noodles are generally fresh noodles, especially 
  since it's against the law to sell dried pasta made from anything 
  but durum wheat and water.<p></p>

<h3>Fettuccini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [308; Lasagnette, Fettucce ]
  <br><img src="img/pa_308fettuccinif3h.jpg" alt="long narrow ribbons" width="220" height="159" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is one of the most common ribbon shapes used with fresh pasta, in 
  fact most pasta machines come with a cutter roll that produces this 
  size, about 0.3 inch wide by however thick you make it. <b>Do Not</b> 
  let it sit as in the photo for more than 30 seconds or you will never 
  be able to get it apart.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Lasagna</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [318]
  <br><img src="img/pa_318lasagnef2e.jpg" alt="Wide Pasta Strips" width="260" height="139" class=mrg>
  Lasagna has been made fresh since the time of Ancient Greece, and was 
  quite popular in Rome. It was used in layered dishes, but exact 
  details of composition. making and cooking are unknown. It may have 
  been quite unlike Lasagna made with pasta.  The photo specimens are 
  about 2-1/2 inches wide, 10 inches long and 0.020 inch thick. 
  Commercial dried lasagna is commonly 2 inches wide, 10 inches long and 
  up to 0.048 inch thick. Fresh is made from less than 2 inches up to 4 
  inches wide and up to 0.032 inch thick as desired by the cook.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Lingue de Suocera</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [121; Mother-in-law tongues]
  <br><img src="img/pa_121lsuocera1c.jpg" alt="Multicolor Ribbon" width="160" height="169" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is a multicolor pasta from Puglia. It is fairly wide, has 
  sharp saw tooth edges and it is twisted.  Dried, it is available 
  commercially, at an extremely high price, often over US $20 per pound.

  Foodiva's Kitchen</a> where Maya provides complete instructions on how 
  to make this at home - if you dare.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Maltagliati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [317]
<br><img src="img/pa_317maltagliatif2h.jpg" alt="Pasta offcuts" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
  Meaning "poorly cut", this name is used for various pasta scraps or 
  cuts that resemble them. Commercially, they may be elongated diamonds, 
  or very short tubes cut diagonally. Italian chefs needing to serve 
  consistent dishes named "maltagliati" may take a strip of fresh 
  pasta about the size of a lasagna and cut narrow triangles from the 
  end, alternating left and right.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Manicotti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [062]
  <br><img src="img/pa_062manicotti1h.jpg" alt="Very large tubes" width="220" height="118" class=mrg>
  In North America these are usually dried, large ridged tubes which are 
  almost soft and stuffed with ricotta cheese and/or spinach or such and 
  then baked with sauce over. In Italy "Manicotti" are more commonly 
  made by wrapping stuffing in fresh crepes, or less commonly in squares 
  of fresh pasta.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Orecchiette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [032 (bronze die); 
    Orecchiette Pugliesi, Little Ears of Puglia]
  <br><img src="img/pa_032orecchiette4h.jpg" alt="Cup Shaped Pastta" width="220" height="150" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  A specialty of the "Heel of Italy", this pasta varies quite a bit in 
  shape depending on how it's made. Ideally, they should be hand made, 
  pressed into shape with your thumb, but commercially they are machine 
  made dried pasta shaped to resemble the hand made product. Generally 
  they are a little less than 1 inch across.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pansotti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [313]
  <br><img src="img/pa_313pansottif2h.jpg" alt="Filled Triangles" width="220" height="164" class=mrg>
  This is a fresh filled pasta made from a 2 inch to 2-1/2 inch square 
  with wavy edges. The squares can best be cut out with a wavy edged  
  roller. Once the filling is placed, it is folded into a triangle.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ravioletti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [319]
  <br><img src="img/pa_319raviolettif2h.jpg" alt="Filled squares" width="220" height="142" class=mrg>
  Ravioletti is like ravioli but smaller, just about any size smaller 
  you like. The photo specimens are about 1.45 inches square. These 
  are often cooked in broth and served with the broth they are cooked in, 
  or they may be served with various sauces. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ravioli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [197]
  <br><img src="img/pa_197raviolif1h.jpg" alt="Filled squares" width="220" height="142" class=mrg>
  These ravioli were made using the Norpro ravioli mold pictured near the 
  top of this page. They are about 1.84 inches square, and since most 
  ravioli making devices produce squares about this same size I'm 
  considering the "standard" size for ravioli. These may be stuffed 
  with meat, cheese or vegetables and are served with various sauces.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ravioloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [198]
  <br><img src="img/pa_198raviolonif2h.jpg" alt="Filled squares" width="220" height="223" class=mrg>
  These are just like ravioli except bigger. The photo specimens were 
  about 2.4 inches square, but it varies with the width I get out of 
  my pasta machine. These may be stuffed with meat or cheese and are 
  served with various sauces. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Spaghetti / Spaghettini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [309]
  <br><img src="img/pa_309spaghettif2h.jpg" alt="long narrow strands" width="220" height="171" class=mrg>
  <p>
  Most pasta making machines come with a "spaghetti" cutting roller, but 
  it makes square spaghetti, not round (cutters that will make it almost 
  round are available at extra cost). My machines cutter makes it quite 
  a bit finer than regular spaghetti, more like spaghettini. <b>Do Not</b> 
  let it sit as in the photo for more than 30 seconds or you will never 
  be able to get it apart.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Spaghetti alla Chitarra</h3>> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [037]
  <br><img src="img/pa_037chitarra2h.jpg" alt="Long Strands" width="220" height="223" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This pasta resembles regular spaghetti and is about the same size but 
  square in cross section. Traditionally it is cut from rolled 
  out dough by doing a final roll across a wooden box, the top of 
  which is tightly strung with wires - the Guitar / Chitarra. The photo 
  specimens are dried, as I didn't have time to build a Chitarra yet, and 
  were 0.080 inch square. Many pasta machines make spaghetti in this 
  form, but usually smaller.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tagliatelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [307; Fettuccini]
  <br><img src="img/pa_307tagliatellef3h.jpg" alt="Wide Ribbons" width="220" height="188" class=mrg>
  This is a very important flat ribbon pasta. For fresh pasta there 
  is no standard, so it can be anywhere between 0.15 and 0.45 inch 
  wide and however thick you make it.  Tagliatelle is most often served 
  with substantial meat sauces. <b>Do Not</b> let it sit as in the photo 
  for more than 30 seconds or you will never be able to get it apart.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Tortelli</h3> - See <a href="pa_italf.html#314"><b>Anolini</b></a>.<p></p>

<h3 id=312>Tortellini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [312]
  <br><img src="img/pa_312tortellinif5h.jpg" alt="Stuffed Pasta" width="220" height="147" class=mrg>
  These are pasta circles, folded over some stuffing into a semicircle, 
  then the peak of the semicircle is turned down over the flat side and 
  the points are brought together around the stuffed side to form a 
  circle. They are often cooked in broth and served with the broth they 
  are cooked in, but they may also be served with various sauces. A 
  light tomato sauce works well with these. The photo specimens were 
  made from 2.75 inch circles, about the smallest size my manly fingers 
  can handle - the ladies may be able to make them from smaller 
  circles. The finished product is about 1.0 inch diameter and 0.75 inch 
  high. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Tortelloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [113]
  <br>Stuffed pasta - a larger version of 
  <a href="pa_italf.html#312"><b>Tortellini</b></a>. Available fresh or frozen but 
  too big to dry commercially so only made fresh.<p></p>
