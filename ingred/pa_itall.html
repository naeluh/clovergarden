<h1>Italian Long Pasta Shapes</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
While bead-like Fregola Sarda may predate all other Italian dried 
pasta, it was not a production product. Pasta production began in Sicily 
some time before 1150 CE, and really took off in Naples some time later. 
The climate and breezes at Naples was just right for air drying pasta on 
a large scale. Simple long forms, mainly spaghetti and vermicelli, totally 
dominated because they could be hung out to dry efficiently, dies for 
these shapes were easy to make, and they could be handled by the 
primitive person powered pasta extrusion machines available at the time.
</span>
<p></p><span class=bg>Today, with modern extrusion and drying equipment, 
there are many more long shapes, and though short shapes now outnumber 
them 10 to 1, a number of long shapes continue to be very popular. Those 
with photos on this page were all purchased in Los Angeles, California.

</ul>

<h3>Angel Hair</h3> - This is pretty much the same thing 
as <a href="pa_itall.html#036">Capellini</a>, the smallest member of the spaghetti 
family.<p></p>

<h3 id="024">Bucatini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [024; Hollow Spaghetti]
  <br><img src="img/pa_024bucatini3d.jpg" alt="Bucatini 024" width="300" height="95" class=mrg>
  This popular pasta is thicker than spaghetti, but it cooks well because 
  it is hollow. Moisture doesn't have to penetrate all the way to the 
  center because there is no center. The photo specimens were 10 inches 
  long and 0.110 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Candele</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [244 (Bronze die); Candles]
  <br><img src="img/pa_244candel02d.jpg" alt="Candele 244" width="300" height="114" class=mrg>
  Basically, these are oversize Ziti. One use for these is to stuff 
  with whole asparagus spears, then layer in a casserole with sauce 
  and cheese. They can be stuffed with other stuffings by use of a 
  pastry pipe. Of course, they can also be served unstuffed with a 
  sauce, still usually baked in a casserole. There is also a 
  Candella Penne version with diagonally cut ends. The photo specimens 
  were 9.5 inches long and 0.58 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

 <h3 id="281">Capelli d'Angelo Nests</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [281, Barbine a nido]
  <br><img src="img/pa_281capellidangelon1h.jpg" alt="Capelli d'Angelo Nests 281" width="220" height="221" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These pasta nests are quite popular. They are often cooked, then set 
  on a plate with a cheese sauce poured over, or they may be dropped 
  into a small bowl with sauce over. The photo specimen was 2.5 inches 
  diameter and 1.0 inch high, made up of pasta 0.40 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="036">Capellini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [036]
  <br><img src="img/pa_036capellini2d.jpg" alt="Capellini 036" width="300" height="67" class=mrg>
  This is the thinnest member of the spaghetti family, die #1 in most 
  systems. The photo specimens were 10.15 inches long and 0.040 inch 
  diameter but some manufacturers go as low as 0.035 inch. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ciriole</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [038]
  <br>Made in Umbria by twisting and stretching a ribbon of pasta until it's 
  about twice as thick as <a href="pa_itall.html#040">Spaghetti</a>. You're not likely 
  to find it anywhere far from Umbria.<p></p>

<h3>Fedelini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [043; Fidelini, Trenette]
  <br><img src="img/pa_043fedelini2d.jpg" alt="Fedelini 043" width="300" height="50" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Similar to Spaghetti but thinner, 0.055 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ferretto Calabro</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [300]
  <br><img src="img/pa_300ferrettoc2f.jpg" alt="Ferretto Calabro 300" width="360" height="50" class=mrg>
  This pasta has the same "S" shaped cross section as 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#086">Casaricci</a> but is much smaller in 
  width and thickness. It is also a lot longer, being the full pasta 
  length of 42 inches folded to 21.5 inches long. It is 0.31 inch wide 
  and 0.17 inch thick. As with Casaricci, this form is very good at 
  holding moderately thick sauces. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="015">Fettuccini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [015; Lasagnette, Fettucce, 
  Tagliatelle]
  <br><img src="img/pa_015fettuccini2d.jpg" alt="Fettuccini 015" width="300" height="73" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is probably the most popular of the wider ribbon pastas, and 
  holds medium to heavy meat sauces well. It needs a bit more care than 
  linguini at the start of cooking because it has a tendency to stick 
  together until the water is back up to a boil.</p>
  <p>There is no definitive difference between Fettuccini and 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#049">Tagliatelle</a>, and both can vary greatly in width. 
  In North American practice, "Fettuccini" more often implies dried 
  pasta, while "Tagliatelle" more often implies fresh pasta. The photo 
  specimens   were 10.2 inches long, 0.180 inch wide and 0.045 inch thick. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Fettuccini Nests</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [320; Tagliatelle]
  <br><img src="img/pa_049tagliatellen1k.jpg" alt="Fettuccini Nests 320" width="200" height="212" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This flat ribbon pasta is sold also as "nests". There is no definitive 
  difference between Fettuccini and <a href="pa_itall.html#049">Tagliatelle</a>. 
  The photo specimens were 0.26 inch wide and 0.035 inch thick. They 
  were labeled "Tagliatelle", but were actually narrower than nests from 
  other makers labeled "Fettuccini", so width is not definitive. 
  Waverly Root holds they are the same thing, with "Fettuccini" the 
  Roman name and "Tagliatelli" used elsewhere. Fettuccini is usually 
  used with heavier meat sauces.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id=026>Fusilli Bucati Lunghi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [026; Fusilli 
  col Buco, Long Springs]
  <br><img src="img/pa_026fusillilunghi3d.jpg" alt="Fusilli Bucati Lunghi 026" width="300" height="108" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These consist of a long hollow pasta, similar to bucatini, wrapped in 
  the manner of a coil spring. The photo specimens were made from 0.115 
  inch diameter tube, wound to 0.27 inch diameter spirals 9 inches 
  long (or more than twice that if you measure around the loop, but the 
  loop will be broken in many cases).
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id=044>Lasagne</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [044]
  <br><img src="img/pa_044lasagne2d.jpg" alt="Lasagne 044" width="300" height="134" class=mrg>
  This is the fancy version, strongly ridged with ruffles on both sides. 
  Other versions are made, including flat, ridged without ruffles
  and ruffles on just one side. Lasagne is often made fresh, in which 
  case it will be flat without ridges or ruffles. The photo specimens 
  were 10 inches long, 2 inches wide and with a wall thickness of 0.048 
  inch, but it may be considerably wider (up to 4"). It is used mainly to 
  make  a casserole called "lasagne al forno" in Italy and in the U.S. 
  just "lasagne". There are also "no boil" versions which don't require 
  pre-cooking.  It appears the Romans prepared a dish similar to lasagne 
  but with fresh pasta rather than dry (and no ruffles), and possibly 
  the Greeks before them.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Lasagne</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [258 (bronze die)]
  <br><img src="img/pa_258lasagneb2d.jpg" alt="Lasagne 258" width="300" height="134" class=mrg>
  This is as fancy as lasagne gets, strongly ridged, with ruffles on 
  both sides, and extruded through bronze dies for better sauce 
  adhesion. The photo specimens were 11 inches long, 2.13 inches wide 
  and with a wall thickness of 0.045 inch.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id=108>Lasagnette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [108]
  <br><img src="img/pa_233plasagnetti2h.jpg" alt="Lasagnette 108" width="220" height="152" class=mrg>
  This pasta may be cut short, as in the photo, or be around 11 inches 
  long. It also comes in the same three styles as 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#044">Lasagne</a>: ruffles both edges, ruffles one edge, and 
  no ruffles. Long ones can be used similarly to regular lasagne, and 
  short cuts are decorative served with pesto. I have not yet 
  obtained them in Italian, so the photo specimens (#233) are Polish, 
  made from bread flour but using a standard Italian die. The main 
  visual difference would be color. These were typically 0.032 inch 
  thick, 0.75 inch wide and 1.5 inches long.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Lasagnotte</h3>
  <br>Same as <a href="pa_itall.html#108">Lasagnette</a> except in lengths longer than 
  the standard 10".<p></p> 

<h3>Lingue de Suocera</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [121; Mother-in-law tongues]
  <br><img src="img/pa_121lsuocera1c.jpg" alt="Lingue de Suocera 121" width="160" height="169" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is a multicolor pasta from Puglia. It is fairly wide, has 
  sharp saw tooth edges and it is twisted.  Dried, it is available 
  commercially, at an extremely high price, often over US $20 per pound. 
  The photo fragment is &copy;

  Foodiva's Kitchen</a> where Maya provides complete instructions on how 
  to make this at home - if you dare.
  <br class=cll></p> 

<h3 id=023>Linguine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [023; Linguini, Linguelline, 
  Bavette fino, Bavettine, Linguittine, Radichini]
  <br><img src="img/pa_023linguine5d.jpg" alt="Linguine 023s" width="300" height="61" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is one of the most popular long pastas in Italy and in North 
  America, and certainly one of mine. It cooks fairly quickly and holds 
  sauces better than spaghetti due to its flattened oval shape. Generally 
  about 10-1/2 inches long, 0.090 inch wide and 0.045 inch thick.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Mafalde</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [046]
  <br>A long ribbon or short pasta with ruffled edges, same as 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#045">Mafaldine</a> but larger.<p></p>

<h3 id="045">Mafaldine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [045]
  <br><img src="img/pa_045mafaldine3d.jpg" alt="Mafaldine 045" width="300" height="103" class=mrg>
  A long ribbon pasta with ruffled edges. It is pretty much identical to 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#107">Riccia</a>.  The photo specimens were 0.48 inch wide by 
  9.2 inches long. Can be used like a mini lasagne in a casserole or 
  eaten with sauce on a plate.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id=282>Mezzanelli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [282]
  <br><img src="img/pa_282mezzanelli2d.jpg" alt="Mezzanelli 282" width="300" height="71" class=mrg>
  This long hollow pasta is just like <a href="pa_itall.html#024">Bucatini</a> except 
  larger in diameter, and identical to #333 Regine. The photo specimens 
  were 10.0 inches long and 0.175 inch diameter.  This is not an easy 
  pasta to find, but the larger size of Greek Pastichio is exactly this 
  size (the smaller is the same size as bucatini).
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Mezzanini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [322 bronze]
  <br><img src="img/pa_322mezzanini2f.jpg" alt="Mezzanini 322" width="360" height="59" class=mrg>
  This long hollow pasta is similar to 282 Mezzanelli except about twice 
  the diameter  The photo specimens, extruded through bronze dies, were 
  20.5 inches long and 0.34 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ondine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [335]
  <br><img src="img/pa_335ondine2h.jpg" alt="Ondine 335" width="220" height="199" class=mrg>
  These corrigated sheets of pasta are meant for easy production of 
  recipes such as lasagne. They ar 7 by 6-1/4 inches and 0.030 inch 
  thick. The package comes with two fitted aluminum pans. They are 
  designed not to need pre-cooking, just soak a few minutes in warm 
  water, then assemble with the sauce. Ingred: enriched semonlina.
  <br class=cll><p></p>


<h3>Pappardelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [283 bronze die]
  <br><img src="img/pa_283pappardelle1f.jpg" alt="Pappardelle 283" width="360" height="72" class=mrg>
  This is a wide flat ribbon pasta generally served with meaty sauces. 
  The photo specimens, extruded through bronze dies, were 44 inches long 
  folded in drying to 21.2 inches. Width was 0.52 inch and thickness 
  0.050 inch. This shape is often made fresh.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Pappardelle Nests</h3>
  <br>A wide flat ribbon pasta generally served with meaty sauces. The 
  "nest" version is exceptionally wide at 1.125". This shape is 
  often made fresh.<p></p>


<h3>Perciatelli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [124]
  <br><img src="img/pa_124perciatelli2d.jpg" alt="Perciatelli 124" width="300" height="72" class=mrg>
  These hollow tubes are very similar to <a href="pa_itall.html#024">Bucatini</a>, 
  but just a little larger diameter. They are about 0.115 inch diameter 
  and 10 inches long.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Pizzoccheri</h3>
  <br>Flat ribbon noodles similar in form to tagliatelle but made with 
  80% buckwheat and 20% wheat flour. These are popular in the Alpine 
  region of northern Italy where buckwheat grows much better than 
  durum wheat.<p></p>

<h3>Regine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [333]
  <br>Identical to <a href="pa_itall.html#282">Mezzanelli</a>, tubular, 10 inches 
  long and 0.175 inch diameter.<p></p>

<h3>Reginelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [102; Reginette]
  <br>A wide ribbon pasta with ruffled edges.<p></p>

<h3 id=107>Riccia</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [107]
  <br>Very similar or identical to <a href="pa_itall.html#045">Mafaldine</a>, 
  about 1/2 inch wide and is sometimes ruffled on one edge only instead 
  of both edges.<p></p>

<h3>Ricciolini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [093; Riccioline, 
  Sfresatine, Manfredine, Fettuccia riccia]
  <br>Similar to Tagliatella, but wider at about 0.59 inch.<p></p>

<h3 id=040>Spaghetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [040]
  <br><img src="img/pa_040spaghetti2d.jpg" alt="Spaghetti 040" width="300" height="62" class=mrg>
  Once practically the only form for dried pasta due to manufacturing 
  considerations, spaghetti is still quite popular, particularly in 
  North America. Personally, I prefer linguini, but use spaghetti for 
  recipes where it is traditional. The photo specimens were 10.15 inches 
  long and 0.075 inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id=037>Spaghetti alla Chitarra</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [037]
  <br><img src="img/pa_037chitarra2h.jpg" alt="Spaghetti alla Chitarra 037" width="220" height="223" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This pasta resembles regular spaghetti and is about the same size but 
  square in cross section. Traditionally it is cut from rolled 
  out dough by doing a final roll across a wooden box , the top of  
  which tightly strung with wires - the Guitar / Chitarra. In Italy this 
  is most often fresh pasta, but it is available dried. The photo 
  specimens were 0.080 inch square by 42 inches long, folded to 21 inches. 
  Many pasta machines make spaghetti in this form.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Spaghetti Lunghi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [284]
  <br><img src="img/pa_284spaghettil1f.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Lunghi 284" width="360" height="48" class=mrg>
  This is exactly the same as regular Spaghetti, but much longer. Those 
  I had on hand were  21 inches long and 0.075 inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Spaghetti al Nero di Seppia</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [285; Spaghetti with Squid Ink]
  <br><img src="img/pa_285spaghettins2f.jpg" alt="Spaghetti al Nero di Seppia 285" width="360" height="53" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is spaghetti dyed black with squid ink, In the case of the photo 
  specimen in is int "lunghi" form. 21 inches, or 42 if you count both 
  sides of the fold. 0.73 inch diameter. Ingred: durum semolina, 
  cuttlefish ink 2%.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Spaghettine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [347 Broze Die]
  <br><img src="img/pa_347spaghettine1d.jpg" alt="Spaghettine 347" width="300" height="56" class=mrg>
  This pasta is much like Linguine, but a little wider and thicker. The 
  photo specimens were 21.5 inches long, 0.111 wide and 0.053 inch 
  thick. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Spaghettini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [014]
  <br><img src="img/pa_014spaghettini2d.jpg" alt="Spaghettini 014" width="300" height="71" class=mrg>
  This pasta is much like spaghetti, but a little thinner. The photo 
  specimens were 10.2 inches long and 0.065 inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Spaghettoni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [192]
  <br><img src="img/pa_192spaghettoni2d.jpg" alt="Spaghettoni 192" width="300" height="60" class=mrg>
  This pasta is much like spaghetti, but a little thicker. 
  The photo specimens were 10.2 inches long and 0.083 inch diameter,  
  almost exactly the same as De Cecco has given for 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#039">Vermicelli</a>.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Stringozzi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [089]
  <br>A specialty of Umbria in central Italy, this is a long thin pasta 
  with a square cross section and a rough texture that is generally sold 
  fresh. It's a little thicker than regular spaghetti but pretty much  
  identical to <a href="pa_itall.html#037">Spaghetti alla Chitarra</a>.<p></p>


<h3 id="049">Tagliatelle</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [049; Tagliarelli, Reginelle, Fresine, Nastri, Fettuccelle, 
    Fettucce romane, Fiadi]
  <br><img src="img/pa_049tagliatellen1k.jpg" alt="Tagliatelle 049" width="200" height="212" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This very important flat ribbon pasta is rarely sold under this 
  name in North America. There is no definitive difference between 
  Tagliatelle and <a href="pa_itall.html#015">Fettuccini</a>, but in North American 
  practice, "Tagliatelle" more often implies pasta made fresh, while 
  "Fettuccini" more often implies dried pasta. The photo specimens were 
  0.26 inch wide and 0.035 inch thick. They were labeled "Tagliatelle", 
  but were actually narrower than nests from other makers labeled 
  "Fettuccini", so width is not definitive. Waverly Root holds they are 
  the same thing, with "Fettuccini" the Roman name and "Tagliatelli" 
  used elsewhere. Tagliatelle is usually used with heavier meat sauces.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Taglierini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [052;  Tagliolini] 
  <br>The smallest pasta in the Tagliatelle family, a flat ribbon pasta 
  a little larger than <a href="pa_itall.html#040">Spaghetti</a>. It is generally 
  made fresh.
  <br class=cll><p></p>


<h3>Trenette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [050; Trinette]
  <br>A flat ribbon pasta smaller than <a href="pa_itall.html#023">Linguini</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Tripoline</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [105]
  <br><img src="img/pa_105tripoline6f.jpg" alt="Tripoline 105" width="360" height="82" class=mrg>
  This is a long ribbon pasta with ruffles on one edge only. The photo 
  specimens were 0.300 inch wide, 9.5 inches long and 0.42 inches thick. 
  Unlike unruffled flat pasta strips these are unlikely to stick 
  together during the early stages of cooking.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id=039>Vermicelli</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; [039; "Little Worms"]
  <br><img src="img/pa_192spaghettoni2d.jpg" alt="Vermicelli 039" width="300" height="60" class=mrg>
  This is one of the very first Italian pastas, already being mde in 
  Sicily before 1150 CE. It is much like spaghetti, but a little thicker. 
  Unfortunately there is confusion because in the USA, the National Pasta 
  Association defines it as thinner than spaghetti. This is pretty much 
  a moot point, since I've never seen any Italian type pasta sold as 
  "Vermicelli" here in California. Consequently, the photo specimens 
  were from a package labeled "Spaghettoni", and were exactly the same 
  thickness given by De Cecco for Italian "Vermicelli". They were 10.2 
  inches long and 0.083 inch diameter. Since Vermicelli is often called 
  for in Italian recipes, I consider the Italian dimension definitive, 
  with Spaghettoni the appropriate substitute.
  <p>From his travels, Marco Polo described Asian noodles as being 
  "like vermicelli", a pasta already long popular in Italy. This has 
  compounded the confusion, because ever since then "vermicelli" has 
  been used as a loan word when translating local noodle names to 
  English - From Anatolia and Caucasus all the way through China and 
  Southeast Asia. The products so named are usually, though not always, 
  considerabley thinner than spaghetti.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Vermicellini</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; [293]
  <br>Thin vermicelli - very much like spaghetti, but just a shade 
  thiner at 0.70 inch diameter.  Often used with a light sauce based 
  on olive oil, garlic and hot chili, accompanying seafood.

<h3>Vermicelloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [041]

  Apparently the "oni" refers to the length, not the thickness, 
  because the photo specimens, extruded through bronze dies, were .083 
  inch diameter, exactly the same as De Cecco lists for vermicelli, but 
  were 20.75 inches long.  This is a rare pasta but I found some at an 
  Italian market in Los Angeles, wrapped up in the traditional blue 
  paper that's not much seen anymore.<p></p>

<h3>Zita</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [052; Ziti, Bridegrooms]
  <br><img src="img/pa_052zita2e.jpg" alt="Zita 052" width="260" height="70" class=mrg>
  This smooth, tubular pasta with straight cut ends is the long form of 
  Ziti, but is sometimes called "Ziti".  They are often partially boiled, 
  then included with sauce in a casserole to be baked. The photo 
  specimens were 0.31 inch diameter and 10 inches long.
