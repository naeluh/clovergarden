<h1>Italian Short Pasta Shapes</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Italy is the center of the world of Pasta. True pasta, also known 
as "macaroni" is made from amber durum, a particular hard, high protein 
(but low gluten) wheat - and none other, and dried. The Italians have 
more shapes, sizes and forms of pasta, and more sauces with which to 
dress them than anywhere else in the world.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>Of course the Italians also make fresh noodles, formed 
from softer varieties of wheat, sometimes with a little harder wheat 
mixed in, often with egg, and sometimes even a little milk. These are 
cut into strands, or made into packets around a filling, and cooked 
fresh.

<h3>Numbers:</h3> &nbsp; The numbers given here are Clovegarden numbers 
and have no relation to Italian die numbers, which vary with 
manufacturer.<p></p>

<h3>Amorini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [100; Little Cupids] 
  <br><i>The Cook's Thesaurus</i> echoes 
  <i>The Complete Book of Pasta</i> (<a href="pa_itals.html#p2">P2</a>) in saying 
  it's a tiny soup pasta but neither provides a illustration of further 
  information. All other evidence, including Italian pasta manufacturers  
  indicate it is similar to or identical to <a href="pa_itals.html#100">Cavatappi</a>, 
  which is certainly not a soup pasta. I've found 
  <i>The Complete Book of Pasta</i> a bit sloppy on some details, so I'm 
  going with Cavatappi.<p></p>

<h3>Ballerine</h3> - Flowers - see <a href="pa_itals.html#011">Campanella</a>.<p></p>

<h3 id="116">Bentagliati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [116; "Well Cut"]
  <br>A flat rectangular pasta cut in short lengths. The name is a play on 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#071">Maltagliati</a>, "badly cut", which is similarly flat but 
  cut into rather random shapes.<p></p>

<h3 id="158">Boccoli</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [158]
  <br><img src="img/pa_158boccoli1h.jpg" alt="Boccoli 158" width="220" height="162" class=mrg>  
  Yet another twisted pasta, much like <a href="pa_itals.html#090">Trofie</a> but 
  shorter and thicker.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Bocconcini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [128]
  <br>Similar to <a href="pa_itals.html#133">Elicoidali</a> but smaller in diameter, 
  0.378 inch diameter by 1.38 to 1.50 inches long with spiral ridges.<p></p>

<h3>Calamarata</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [130; Small Calamari, 
    Squid Rings]
  <br><img src="img/pa_129calamarata1h.jpg" alt="Calamarata 130" width="220" height="141" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Wide rings in appearance much like squid rings, thus the name. The 
  photo specimens were 1.05 inch diameter and 1 inch randoms in length. 
  Some manufacturers cut them a little shorter.</p>
  <p>I find these very 
  convenient for using up leftover pasta stuffing. After boiling nearly 
  done, they stuff really easily. I set them on end in a baking dish, 
  with a little sauce over, or even just a drizzle of olive oil. I start 
  them in a 350&deg;F oven covered with foil (with a little water in the 
  bottom if no sauce), then finish uncovered.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Calamari</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [129; Calamari, Squid 
    Rings]
  <br>This is a larger version of #130 Calamarata.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="011">Campanelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [011; 
    Gigli, Flowers]
  <br><img src="img/pa_011campanelle1e.jpg" alt="Campanelle 011" width="260" height="186" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  One of the more decorative shapes, and very good at holding sauces. The 
  photo specimens were 1.22 inches long and 0.63 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cannelloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [125; Cannelloni Zitoni]
  <br><img src="img/pa_125cannelloni2h.jpg" alt="Cannelloni 125" width="220" height="180" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are one of the most common pasta tubes for stuffing. The photo 
  specimens are about 1.0 inch diameter by 4.03 inches long, though some 
  manufacturers make them a little shorter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Canneroni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [131]
  <br>Sort smooth tubes, 0.57 inch diameter by 0.85 inch long.<p></p>

<h3>Canneroni Grandi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [152; Tufoli]
  <br>Longer than regular Canneroni, 0.57 inch diameter by 1.6 inches 
  long. More commonly known as <a href="pa_itals.html#152">Tufoli</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Capunti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [352]
  <br><img src="img/pa_352capunti2h.jpg" alt="Capunti 352" width="220" height="170" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These pasta shapes were 1.95 x 0.40 inches. Product of Italy - durum 
  semolina, water.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Careroni Rigati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [002]
  <br><img src="img/pa_002carrig1h.jpg" alt="Careroni Rigati 002" width="220" height="168" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Very small ridged tubes, 0.31 inch diameter by 0.88 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="086">Casaricci</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    086; Cesariccia, Casarecce, House Curls]
  <br><img src="img/pa_086casaricci2h.jpg" alt="Casaricci 086" width="220" height="173" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This popular shape is "S" shaped in cross section. It is very good at 
  picking up sauces. I used these very successfully for buffet for use 
  with several sauces. They were cooked, lightly coated in extra virgin 
  olive oil and kept in a large slow cooker set to "keep warm".  The 
  photo specimens were 1.75 inches long and 0.375 inch wide. A very 
  similar, but much longer, version is <a href="pa_itals.html#080">Strozzapreti</a> 
  (Priest Strangler). 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="100">Cavatappi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    100; amorini]
  <br><img src="img/pa_100cavatappi2h.jpg" alt="Cavatappi 100" width="220" height="192" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is a fairly decorative shape and looks good on the plate. Best 
  for light to medium sauces. The photo specimens were 1.58 inches long 
  with a 0.48 inch spiral. The ridged tubes it is wound from are 0.22 
  inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="087">Cavatelli</h3>
  <br>Short pastas shaped rather like a hot dog bun. Be aware that the 
  same name is also used for a small dumpling stuffed with ricotta 
  cheese.<p></p>

<h3>Cavatelli Murgiani</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [271 (bronze die)]
  <br><img src="img/pa_271cavatellimurgiani2h.jpg" alt="Cavatelli Murgiani 271" width="220" height="146" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Regular Cavatelli are short and look like tiny hot dog buns. This one 
  looks like a bun for a foot-long hot dog. In any case, it'll scoop 
  up plenty of sauce. The photo specimens were 1.67 inches long, 4.35 
  inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cellentani</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [021]
  <br><img src="img/pa_021corkscrew1h.jpg" alt="Cellentani 021" width="220" height="117" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are pretty much the same <a href="pa_itals.html#100">Cavatappi</a> but 
  perhaps a little shorter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chiffera Rigati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [003]
  <br><img src="img/pa_003chiffrig1h.jpg" alt="Chiffera Rigati 003" width="220" height="125" class=mrg>
  Ridged elbows, typical of northern and central Italy. About 0.6 
  inch long by 0.18 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Cigarette Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [279]
  <br><img src="img/pa_279cigaretter1h.jpg" alt="Cigarette Rigate 279" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Medium ridged tubes cut square at the ends, similar to ziti but ridged. 
  The photo specimens were 0.37 inch diameter and 1.75 inch random 
  lengths.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="012">Conchiglie</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [012; Medium Shells]
  <br><img src="img/pa_012shellm2h.jpg" alt="Conchiglie 012" width="220" height="206" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This the midrange of the many sizes this very popular pasta 
  comes in. It's scooped out shape enables it to pick up a large 
  amount of sauce, so it's good for sauces that have an adhesion 
  problem. The photo specimens were 1.01 inches long and around 
  0.67 inch across, but this will vary a bit with manufacturer. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="274">Conchiglie</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [274; Large Shells, Tofette]
  <br><img src="img/pa_274shelllg2h.jpg" alt="Conchiglie 274" width="220" height="186" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is above the midrange of the many sizes this very popular 
  pasta comes in. It's scooped out shape enables it to pick up a large 
  amount of sauce, so it's good for sauces that have an adhesion 
  problem. The photo specimens were 1.19 inches long and around 
  0.80 inch across, but this will vary a bit with manufacturer. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="054">Conchiglioni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [054; Giant Shells]
  <br><img src="img/pa_054conchiglioni2h.jpg" alt="Conchiglioni 054" width="220" height="162" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Giant shells are popular for stuffing. The photo specimens were 
  2.8 inches long and 1.6 inches across. They were actually plain ones 
  from a bag of Tricolore shells. They are ridged, but they are so large 
  compared to the ridges that's hard to see in the photo.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="254">Conchiglioni</h3> &nbsp; - 
    &nbsp; [254 bronze die; Giant Shells]
  <br><img src="img/pa_254conchob1h.jpg" alt="Conchiglioni 254" width="220" height="159" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Giant shells are popular for stuffing. The photo specimens are an 
  artisinal brand, made using bronze dies. They were 2.5 inches long 
  and 1.3 inches across.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="273">Conchigliette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [273; Small Shells]
  <br><img src="img/pa_273shellsm1h.jpg" alt="Conchigliette 273" width="220" height="176" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These shells are very small, but nowhere near the smallest they come. 
  Their scooped out shape enables it to pick up a large 
  amount of sauce, so it's good for sauces that have an adhesion 
  problem. The photo specimens were 0.44 inches long and around 
  0.41 inch across. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Creste de Gallo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [004; Cock's Crests]
  <br><img src="img/pa_004crestedegallo6h.jpg" alt="Creste de Gallo 004" width="220" height="137" class=mrg>
  <p>
  An interesting decorative shape, and a good sauce holder. but a 
  bit problematic for cooking. The tube will be well cooked by time 
  the root of the ruffle is done enough, so they end up with a double 
  texture. The photo specimens had a tube diameter of 0.32 inch and a 
  length of 1.34 inches.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="098">Croxetti</h3>
  <br>A thin flat disk shaped Ligurian pasta stamped with the makers family 
  crest on one side and some design on the other side. Generally about 
  1-3/4" in diameter.<p></p>

<h3>Cuoricini 5 Color</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [295; Hearts]
  <br><img src="img/pa_295cuoricini5c2h.jpg" alt="Cuoricini 5 Coor 295" width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are extruded as a tube of hear shaped cross section and cut off 
  short. They are 0.75 inch from point to lobes, and 0.5 inch random 
  lengths. Ingred: durum wheat, 
  dehydrated spinach 2%, dehydrated beetroot 2%, red pepper sweet 2%, 
  dehydrated tomatoes 2%, turmeric 2%. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Dischi Volanti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [263; Dischi, Messicani, Flying 
  Saucers, UFO]
<br><img src="img/pa_236pthim06h.jpg" alt="Dischi Volanti 263" width="220" height="153" class=mrg>
<p>
These are considered suitable for casseroles and salads. I have not yet 
obtained them in Italian, so the photo specimens (#236) are Polish, 
made from bread flour but using a standard Italian die. The main 
visual difference would be color. These were typically 0.80 inch 
diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ditali</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [063; Thimbles]
  <br><img src="img/pa_063ditali2h.jpg" alt="Ditali 063" width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Smooth medium size tubes cut very short 0.35 inches diameter by 
  0.45 inches long. These are very often used in making pasta salads.
  Actually, I prefer Ditali Regate (ridged ditali) when I can get it. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ditali Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [250; Ridged Thimbles]
  <br><img src="img/pa_250ditalir2h.jpg" alt="Ditali Rigate 250" width="220" height="204" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Ridged medium size tubes cut very short 0.33 inches diameter by 
  0.45 inches long. These are very often used in making pasta salads, 
  and I prefer these to the smooth version. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Ditalini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [171; Tiny Thimbles]
  <br><img src="img/pa_171ditelini1h.jpg" alt="Ditalini 171" width="220" height="191" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Under magnification these proved to be ditalini rigate. The photo 
  specimens are very tiny, 0.19 inch long, 0.18 inch diameter. Good 
  particularly for soups. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="010">Egg Noodles</h3>
  <br>In Italy, egg noodles are generally fresh noodles, especially 
  since it's against the law to sell dried pasta made from anything 
  but durum wheat and water.<p></p>

<h3 id="270">Elbows, Tiny</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [270]
  <br><img src="img/pa_270elbowtiny2h.jpg" alt="Elbows 270" width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These exceptionally small elbows are fine for soups and salads. The 
  photo specimens were 0.46 inch across and 0.12 inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll></p>    


<h3 id=272>Elbows, Small</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [272]
  <br><img src="img/pa_272elbowsmall1h.jpg" alt="Small Elbows 272" width="220" height="164" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These small elbows are good for salads. I consider them better for 
  that usage than the common medium elbow. 0.59 inch across and 0.18 inch 
  diameter. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Elbows, Large</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [275]
  <br><img src="img/pa_275elbowlg2h.jpg" alt="Large Elbows 275" width="220" height="202" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These large elbows are favored by many for use in American Mac &amp; 
  Cheese casseroles. The photo specimens were 1.09 inch across and 0.26 
  inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="133">Elicoidali</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [133; 
    Spiral Rigatoni]
  <br><img src="img/pa_133elicoidali2h.jpg" alt="Elicoidali 133" width="220" height="178" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is much like Rigatoni, except the ridges are spiral. I have found 
  this a good size for medium thick sauces. The photo specimens were 
  1.45 inches long by 0.45 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Fagioloni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [134]
  <br>narrow tubes about 1 inch long.<p></p>


<h3 id="028">Farfalle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [028; Butterflies, 
    Bow Ties]
  <br><img src="img/pa_028farfalle1h.jpg" alt="Farfalle 028" width="220" height="149" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Available in various sizes. Shown are medium,  1.3 x 0.95 inches.  
  Small would be about 1.0 x 0.75 inches and large about 1-1/2"x1-1/8". 
  Watch these carefully during cooking. The pinch must not be chalky, 
  but needs to be distinctly chewy or the flat parts will be overcooked.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Farfalle Tricolor</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [249; Butterflies, 
  Bow Ties]
  <br><img src="img/pa_249farfalat2h.jpg" alt="Farfalle Tricolor 249" width="220" height="165" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These medium size bows are 1.3 x 0.95 inches. Ingred: durum wheat 
  semolina, tomato (1.3%), spinach (0.7%). special care in cooking is 
  the same as for regular Farfalle. They should be served with a simple 
  butter or oil sauce to preserve color.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Farfallone</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [099; 
    Large Butterflies, Large Bow Ties]
  <br><img src="img/pa_099farfallone2h.jpg" alt="Farfallone 099" width="220" height="153" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is the largest of the Butterflies, 1.65 inches long and 1.09 
  inches wide. Watch these carefully during cooking. The pinch must not 
  be chalky, but needs to be distinctly chewy or the flat parts will be 
  overcooked.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Fiorentine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [112; Florence]
  <br><img src="img/pa_112fiorentine1h.jpg" alt="Florentine" width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  A complex shape made in Vinci, Tuscany. Similar to 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#083">Torchio</a> but longer and considerably more complex. 
  The photo specimens were 0.75 inch across the widest point and 1.88 
  inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Fiori</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [097]
  <br><img src="img/pa_097fiori2h.jpg" alt="Fiori 097" width="220" height="160" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This pasta is shaped as if composed of seven ridged tubes, one in the 
  center and six surrounding it. Shown here is the tricolore version with 
  spinach and tomato coloring. 0.63 inch diameter by 0.25 inch thick.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Foglie d'Autunno</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [118; Autumn Leaves]
  <br><img src="img/pa_118foglie01h.jpg" alt="Foglie d'Autunno 118" width="220" height="152" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Named for the colored leaves of Autumn, these elongated leaf shaped 
  pastas are dyed with up to 7 colors from natural herbs and 
  vegetables. Roughly 1-3/4 inches long and 0.63 inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Foglie di Carciofo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [006; Artichoke 
  Leaves]
  <br><img src="img/pa_006fcarciofo2h.jpg" alt="Foglie di Carciofo 006" width="220" height="155" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Formed to resemble leaves pulled off an artichoke, these are rough and 
  concave on one side which will provide good sauce adhesion. The 
  manufacturer suggests serving with mascarpone cheese, quartered 
  artichoke hearts and toasted pine nuts. Ingred: durum semolina, 
  artichoke, poppy seed, water. The photo specimens were 1.40 inches 
  long by 0.80 inch across.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Fregola Sarda</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [120; Fregula]
  <br><img src="img/pa_120fregola1h.jpg" alt="Fregola Sarda 120" width="220" height="188" class=mrg>
  <p>
  "Sardinian Couscous" (0.09 to 0.15" diameter) is though by some to 
  be the ancestor of all Italian dried pastas. Sardinia maintained trade 
  with North Africa for much of its history, so this form may have been 
  brought from there, or taken from there to Africa. Unlike other Italian 
  pastas it is made from a coarser grind of semolina and is lightly oven 
  toasted.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Funghi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [115, Mushrooms]
  <br>Similar to <a href="pa_itals.html#083">Torchio</a> but formed into the shape of 
  a mushroom cap and stem.<p></p>

<h3 id="031">Fusilli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [031; Spirals]
  <br><img src="img/pa_031fusilli2h.jpg" alt="Fusilli 031" width="220" height="153" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  In the form of an archimedes screw, typically with three fins. This 
  is a very popular pasta with very good sauce holding capability. It 
  is particularly good with plain butter and black pepper. 0.37 diameter 
  by 1.45 inches long (exact size varies with manufacturer). 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="106">Fusilli Avellinesi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [106; Troffie]
  <br><img src="img/pa_106trofiette03e.jpg" alt="Fusilli Avellinesi 106" width="260" height="134" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Originally made by wrapping a cut strip of pasta around a bicycle 
  spoke. Always light color to resemble home made pasta. Often served 
  with Pesto, which it holds well. 2 inches long by 0.2 inch wide.
  Pretty much identical to Troffie.

<h3>Fusilli Avellinesi 5 Color</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [294; Troffie]
  <br><img src="img/pa_294fusilav5c2h.jpg" alt="Fusilli Avellinesi 5 Color 294" width="220" height="210" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is a multi-color version of <a href="pa_itals.html#106">Fusilli Avellinesi</a>, 
  0.22 inch diameter by 2.4 inch random lengths. Ingred: durum wheat, 
  dehydrated spinach 2%, dehydrated beetroot 2%, red pepper sweet 2%, 
  dehydrated tomatoes 2%, turmeric 2%. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="091">Fusilli Bucati Corti</h3> &nbsp; - 
    &nbsp; [091; Spiralini, Tight wound springs]
  <br><img src="img/pa_091fusillibc1h.jpg" alt="Fusilli Bucati Corti 091" width="220" height="175" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These consist of a tubular pasta, similar to 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#024">Bucatini</a>, wrapped in the manner of a 
  coil spring and cut short. It is wound with a much tighter pitch than 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#026">Fusilli Bucati Lunghi</a>, 
  the full length version. The photo specimens were made from tubes about 
  0.12 inch diameter wound to a coil 0.34 inch diameter and 1.5 inches 
  random lengths. The name is from <i>fuso</i>, a spindle, because this pasta was 
  once made by wrapping pasta tubes around a rod or kinitting needle.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Gamelli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [088; Twins]
  <br><img src="img/pa_088gamelli2h.jpg" alt="Gamelli 088" width="220" height="154" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These consist of two long thin tubes twisted around each other. They 
  are roughly 0.27 inches across the twist and 1.4 inches long. This is 
  a fairly common shape and an excellent choice when medium sauce 
  adhesion is needed.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="059">Garganelli</h3>
  <br>Superficially these look like <a href="pa_itals.html#060">Penne</a>, but the points 
  are on the same side. It's made by rolling a pasta square diagonally into 
  a tube.<p></p>

<h3>Gigli</h3> - see <a href="pa_itals.html#011">Campanella</a>.<p></p>

<h3 id="278">Gnocchi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [278]
  <br><img src="img/pa_278gnochi2h.jpg" alt="Pasta Gnocchi 278" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  A pasta named for the potato dumplings of the same name due to its
  similar shape. Usage characteristics are similar to medium shells, 
  and they are sometimes called "shells". The photo specimens were 
  1.15 inch long and 0.68 inch wide.  
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="065">Gnocchi Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [065]
  <br><img src="img/pa_065gnocchi1h.jpg" alt="Pasta Gnocchi Rigate 065" width="220" height="134" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  A pasta named for the potato dumplings of the same name due to its
  similar shape. Usage characteristics are similar to medium shells, 
  and they are sometimes called "shells". The photo specimens were 
  1.18 inch long and 0.63 inch wide. They are ridged in the same 
  direction as the lobes, but the ridges are tiny and don't show up 
  well in the photo. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="277">Gnocchi Sardi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [277; Malloreddus, Sardi, Gnocchetti Sardi]
  <br><img src="img/pa_277gsardi1h.jpg" alt="Pasta Gnocchi Sardi 277" width="220" height="191" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  In the north, Gnocchi are made from potatoes, but in Sardinia they are 
  made from durum wheat. Good with tomato or meat sauces.  The photo 
  specimens were 0.81 inch long and 0.31 inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="070">Gnocchi Sardi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [070 (bronze die); Malloreddus, Sardi, Gnocchetti Sardi]
  <br><img src="img/pa_070gsardi2h.jpg" alt="Pasta Gnocchi Sardi 070" width="220" height="153" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  In the north, Gnocchi are made from potatoes, but in Sardinia they are 
  made from durum wheat. Good with tomato or meat sauces.  The photo 
  specimens, extruded with a bronze die, were 0.68 inch long and 0.385 
  inch wide.  These pastas are sometimes flavored with saffron.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Gnocchetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [067; Gnocchi Picoli]
  <br>A smaller version of the <a href="pa_itals.html#278">Gnocchi</a> pasta. 
  0.75 inch long, 0.50 inch wide.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Gomiti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [135]
  <br>Short "C" shaped tubes, ridged or not, similar to regular Elbows 
  but a bit stubbier.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Gramigna</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [068]
  <br>Small curls of pasta, curved like elbow macaroni but much longer 
  compared to its diameter. They start almost gently curved at one end 
  and curl fairly tightly at the other. Difficult to find outside Northern 
  Italy and nearly impossible to find in North America.<p></p>

<h3 id=069>Lumache</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [069; Small Snails, Small 
    Pipes]
  <br><img src="img/pa_255lumache2h.jpg" alt="Lumache 069" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are good to use with chunky sauces. The photo specimens were 
  0.75 inch long and 0.49 inch wide across the squished end.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="017">Lumaconi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [017; Snails, Pipes]
  <br><img src="img/pa_017lumiconib2h.jpg" alt="Lumaconi 017" width="220" height="166" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Boiled to just done, these are large enough to be stuffed using a 
  pastry pipe, then baked. 1.0 inch long by 0.75 inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Lumaconi, Giant bronze</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [248; Giant Snails, Giant Pipes]
  <br><img src="img/pa_248lumaconig2h.jpg" alt="Giant Lumaconi 248" width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Extruded through bronze dies, these have a rough texture that holds 
  sauces well. They are good for stuffing with a pastry pipe, then baking. 
  1.45 inch long by 1.25 inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="056">Macaroni</h3>
  <br>This American spelling implies <a href="pa_itals.html#270">"Elbow Macaroni"</a>, 
  by far the most popular tubular pasta in North America, particularly 
  for "macaroni and cheese" casseroles.  See also 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#058">Maccheroni</a>.<p></p>

<h3 id="058">Maccheroni</h3>
  <br>Today, a generic term for any small tubular pasta, but back in the 
  early days of pasta making it was the generic term for all of what we 
  call "dried pasta" today. Of course, back then, it was mostly 
  spaghetti. For U.S. usage see <a href="pa_itals.html#056">Macaroni</a>.<p></p>

<h3 id="061">Maccheroncelli</h3>
  <br>I cannot define this pasta for you, because there is no agreement 
  among manufacturers except that it is hollow. It may be long, or short, 
  or extruded or rolled, and may even be made out of egg pasta. The most 
  common definition is long tubes about 0.18 inch diameter by 10 inches 
  long.<p></p>

<h3>Mafalde</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [046]
  <br>A long ribbon or short pasta with ruffled edges, same as 
  <a href="pa_itall.html#045">Mafaldine</a> but larger.<p></p>

<h3>Magliette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [136]
  <br>Here is another that has major disagreement as to what it is. The 
  consensus is that it is a sort tube, but about twice as long and 
  much less curved than <a href="pa_itals.html#272">Elbows</a>. Others say it is a 
  very short Penne Lisce.<p></p>

<h3 id="071">Maltagliati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [071]
  <br>Meaning "poorly cut", this name is used for various pasta scraps or 
  cuts that resemble them. Commercially, they may be elongated diamonds, 
  or very short tubes cut diagonally.<p></p>

<h3>Manicotti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [062]
  <br><img src="img/pa_062manicotti1h.jpg" alt="Manicotti 062" width="220" height="118" class=mrg>
  These large ridged tubes are generally boiled almost soft and stuffed 
  with ricotta cheese and/or spinach or such and then baked. They may be 
  cut straight or diagonally at the ends. Diagonally cut units are 
  about 1-1/4" diameter by 4-1/2 inches long. Straight cut would be a 
  little shorter.  These are more Italian-American than Italian. In 
  Italy "Manicotti" recipes are more commonly made by wrapping stuffing 
  in crepes, or in squares of fresh pasta.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="072">Margherite</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [072; Daisy]
  <br>Resembles a small shell more than it does a daisy.<p></p>

<h3>Mezzani</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [138; Mezze Ziti, 
    Perciatelloni, Regine, Scaloppi, Napoletan]
  <br>medium pasta tubes, slightly curved, ridged or not. They are 
  around 0.22 inch diameter and about 1.5 inches long.<p></p>


<h3>Mezze Penne</h3> - [296 (Lisce) 297 (Regate)]
  These are simply <a href="pa_itals.html#060">Penne Lisce</a> and 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#057">Penne Regate</a> cut to half the usual length.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Mezzi Rigatoni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [301]
  <br><img src="img/pa_301mezzirigatoni2h.jpg" alt="Mezzi Rigatoni 301" width="220" height="159" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is just like regular Rigitoni, but cut much shorter. The 
  photo specimens were 1.2 inches long by 0.66 inch diameter, but 
  other manufacturers cut shorter at about 1 inch.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Millerighi</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [159]
  <br><img src="img/pa_159millerighi2h.jpg" alt="Millerighi 159" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Medium size lengthwise ribbed tubes. 1.9 inches long by 0.66 inch 
  diameter. Also 1-3/4 x 0.78 inches.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Mista</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [096]
  <br>A mix of similarly sized shapes.<p></p>

<h3>Mostaccioli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [143]
  <br><img src="img/pa_143mostaccioli2h.jpg" alt="Mostaccioli 143" width="220" height="190" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is an angle cut tube pretty much the same as Penne Lisce (smooth 
  penne). They vary in size by manufacturer so I know of no definitive 
  difference between the two. The photo specimens were 0.33 inch diameter 
  and random lengths from 1.6 inches to 1.82 inches.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Nuvole</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [265]
  <br><img src="img/pa_264pnuvole2h.jpg" alt="Nuvole 265" width="220" height="141" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These are short rectangles given a unique twist. I have not yet 
  obtained them in Italian, so the photo specimens (#264) are Polish, 
  made from bread flour but using a standard Italian Nuvole die. The 
  main visual difference would be color. These were typically 0.32 inch 
  thick, 0.8 inch wide and 0.7 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Orecchiette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [032 (bronze die); 
    Orecchiette Pugliesi, Little Ears of Puglia]
  <br><img src="img/pa_032orecchiette4h.jpg" alt="Orecchiette 032" width="220" height="150" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  A specialty of the "Heel of Italy", this pasta varies quite a bit in 
  shape depending on how it's made. Ideally, they should resemble the 
  hand made product, which is squeezed cup shape with the thumb. Made 
  with a conventional extrusion die they are by necessity rectangular 
  cups, but most are made by a more complex process and are roughly 
  round.</p>
  <p>The photo specimens were about 0.87 inch 
  long and 0.76 inch across. Just about all orecchiette sold claim to 
  be made using bronze dies, and many are rougher on the inside surface 
  than the photo specimens. I have always liked these in soup, but they 
  are more commonly used with sauces. Their cupped shape allows them to 
  carry quite a bit of even thin sauces, but the disadvantage is that 
  they tend to nest together in stacks.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Orecchiette 032a</h3> &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
  <br><img src="img/pa_032orecchiette1h.jpg" alt="Orecchiette 032a" width="220" height="161" class=mrg>
  For shame, Trader Joe's! Yes, I know, they were made in Italy, but 
  these are the saddest excuse for orecchiette I've ever seen. They 
  don't look like "little ears, they look like tiny condoms 
  (condominiums?) that haven't been unrolled yet. The photo specimens 
  were 0.80 inch in diameter and devoid of texture - no attempt whatever 
  to make them look like hand made.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Orecchiette Baresi</h3> &nbsp;  &nbsp; [305]
  <br><img src="img/pa_305orecchietteb1h.jpg" alt="Orecchiette Baresi 305" width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
  These are much like regular Orecchiette, but are squeezed to be a bit 
  longer, are distinctly ridged on the outside and are quite deep. The 
  photo specimens were 0.90 inch long, 0.67 inch wide and 0.390 inch 
  deep.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Orecchiette Piccole</h3> &nbsp;  &nbsp; [306]
  <br><img src="img/pa_306orecchiettep2h.jpg" alt="Orecchiette Piccole 306" width="220" height="173" class=mrg>
  These are much like regular Orecchiette, but significantly smaller (the 
  piccole part). The photo specimens were 0.62 inch diameter and 0.26 inch 
  deep.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>O'Sole Mio</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [207; Suns ]
  <br><img src="img/pa_207osolemio1h.jpg" alt="O'Sole Mio 207" width="220" height="133" class=mrg>
  A common whimsical shape. The photo specimens were 1.25 inches diameter 
  and 0.43 inch thick.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Paccheri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [141]
  <br>A large smooth tube shaped pasta, usually about 1.0 inch diameter 
  and 1-3/4 inches long, straight cut at the ends.<p></p>

<h3>Paccheri Ondulati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [210]
  <br><img src="img/pa_210paccherio01h.jpg" alt="Paccheri Ondulati 210" width="220" height="155" class=mrg>
  These large tubes are Like <a href="pa_itals.html#286">Paccheri Rigati</a> but with 
  an undulating surface in place of ridges. The photo specimens,
  extruded through bronze dies, were about 1.1 inch diameter and 2 inch 
  randoms in length.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="286">Paccheri Rigati</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [286 bronze die]
  <br><img src="img/pa_286pacherir2h.jpg" alt="Paccheri Rigati 286" width="220" height="133" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is the same as Paccheri, but with ridges rather than smooth. 
  The photo specimens, extruded through bronze dies, were 2.42 inches 
  long and 1.0 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pansotti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [196]
  <br>Fresh pasta 2 inch squares stuffed and then folded corner to 
  corner to form a triangle.<p></p>

<h3>Pantacce</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [346]
  <br><img src="img/pa_346pant01h.jpg" alt="Pantacce 346" width="220" height="194" class=mrg>
  Smooth flat or wavy squares, 7-7/8 x 1-1/2 x 040 - size may vary. 
  These are often cut at an angle to form a rhomboid parallelogram. They 
  may also have two edges lightly or strongly rippled. Often associated 
  with Tuscany.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Pasta al Ceppo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [144]
  <br>Pasta tubes formed like a cinnamon stick<p></p>

<h3 id=060>Penne Lisce</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [060]
  <br><img src="img/pa_060pennel1h.jpg" alt="Penne Lisce 060" width="220" height="152" class=mrg>
  <p>
  Often called just "Penne" with no qualifier, this is the basic quill 
  pasta. Named for old fashioned quill pens, these smooth tubes are cut 
  diagonally at the ends. The photo specimens were 2 inches long and 
  0.375 inch diameter, but exact size varies with manufacturer.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Penne Mezzane</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [296 (Lisce) 208 (Regate)]
  <br><img src="img/pa_208pennemr3h.jpg" alt="Penne Mezzane 296" width="220" height="117" class=mrg>
  <p>
  A thinner, shorter version of Penne, but bigger in diameter than 
  Pennette. There are smooth and ridged versions. The photo specimens 
  were 0.32 inch diameter by 1.8 inches long, actually the same size as 
  some other manufacturers' Penne Rigate, but I've also seen them as 
  small as 0.26 inch diameter and 1.5 inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Penne Mezzanine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [205]
  <br><img src="img/pa_205pennemezz1h.jpg" alt="Penne Mezzanine 205" width="220" height="100" class=mrg>
  <p>
  A thinner, shorter version of Penne Mezzane, smaller than Pennette. 
  The photo specimens were 0.17 diameter by 1.38 inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id=057>Penne Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [057]
  <br><img src="img/pa_057penner2h.jpg" alt="Penne Rigate 057" width="220" height="187" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is one of the most useful of the tube shaped pastas for just 
  serving with sauce. Not too big, not too small, the diagonal cut ends 
  give it some character, and the ridges hold sauce well. The photo 
  specimens were 1.83 inches long and 0.320 inch diameter, but exact 
  size varies with manufacturer.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Penne Rigate Tricolore</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [143]
  <br><img src="img/pa_261pennert2h.jpg" alt="Penne Rigate Tricolore 143" width="220" height="149" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These are the same as regular penne rigate, but some of the pieces are 
  colored with natural ingredients. The photo specimens were 0.30 inch 
  diameter and 1.6 inches long. Ingred: durum wheat semolina, tomato 
  (less than 3%), spinach (less than 3%). Cooking is the same as for 
  regular Penne Rigate, but they should be served with a simple butter 
  or oil sauce to preserve color and flavor. The colorings do affect 
  flavor, particularly the spinach, but not strongly.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Penne Zita Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [280 bronze die]
  <br><img src="img/pa_280pennezr1h.jpg" alt="Zita Rigate 280" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is pretty much the largest size of penne rigate. The photo 
  specimens, made with a bronze die, were 2.67 inches long and 0.59 inch 
  diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pennette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [111]
  <br><img src="img/pa_111pennette1h.jpg" alt="Pennette 111" width="220" height="200" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These are the smaller version of Penne Lisce (smooth penne). The photo 
  specimens were 1.75 inches long, 0.22 inch	diameter, but I've seen some as 
  small as 0.18 inch diameter by 1.65 inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pennette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [324]
  <br><img src="img/pa_324pennette2h.jpg" alt="Pennette 324" width="220" height="141" class=mrg>
  <p>
  Another take on Pennette by the prestigeous De Cecco company. The 
  photo specimens were 0.22 inch diameter like #111, only 0.67 inch long. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pennette Rigate</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [310 bronze]
  <br><img src="img/pa_310pennetterb2h.jpg" alt="Pennette Rigate 310" width="220" height="143" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These are the smaller version of Penne Rigate (ridged penne). The photo 
  specimens were 2.0 inches long, 0.28 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pennini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [146]
  <br>Smaller diameter than Pennette, but longer, ridged or smooth.<p></p>

<h3>Pennoni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [007]
  <br><img src="img/pa_007pennoni2h.jpg" alt="Pennoni 007" width="220" height="136" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These very large penne are just within stuffing range, but are more 
  likely to be used with a chunky sauce in a casserole. The photo 
  specimens, extruded through bronze dies, were 2.46 inches long and 
  0.53 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pipe</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [094]
  <br>Also Pipette (smaller). Elbows very similar to or identical to 
  <a href="pa_itals.html#069">Lumache</a>. One end wide open, the other squashed 
  almost closed.<p></p>

<h3>Quadrefiore</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [074]
  <br>A short pasta, squarish in cross section with four or more ruffled 
  ridges lengthwise. More three dimensional than many pastas.<p></p>

<h3>Racchette</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [325]
  <br><img src="img/pa_325racchette2h.jpg" alt="Racchette 325" width="220" height="147" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is a "whimsical" shape by prestigeous pasta company De Cecco, 
  shaped like tennis rackets, 1.22 inches long, 0.60 wide and 0.017 inch 
  thick. Obviously these would be very good at picking light sauces and 
  holding them. De Cecco recommends serving with diced zucchini with an 
  onion and tomato.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Radiatori</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [075; Radiators]
  <br><img src="img/pa_075radiatori1h.jpg" alt="Radiatori 075" width="220" height="214" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are a short pasta with prominent radial fins, making it resemble 
  an old fashioned room heater. They can hold a large amount of even a 
  rather thin sauce. The photo specimens were 1 inch long and 
  0.65 across the fins. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Reginelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [147]
  <br>Tubes similar to Penne but longer and smaller diameter. See 
  also next definition <a href="pa_itals.html#102">102</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Riccioli</h3> - see <a href="pa_itals.html#011">Campanella</a>.<p></p>
  
<h3>Rigatoni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [016]
  <br><img src="img/pa_016rigatoni1h.jpg" alt="Rigatoni 016" width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These ridged tubes are one of the more popular midsize tubular pastas. 
  They are usually served with sauce. The photo specimens were 1.76 inches 
  long, 0.65 inch diameter, but size varies quite a bit with manufacturer.
  <br class=cll></p>

  These are oversize rigatoni extruded through a bronze die. They are 
  more than big enough to stuff using a pastry pipe. The photo specimens 
  were 2.00 inch long, 0.75 inch diameter.

<h3>Rotelle (1)</h3> - Spirals, Twists
  <br>A pasta formed into a tight spiral resembling the augers used by 
  post hole digging machines. It is similar to <a href="pa_itals.html#031">Fusilli</a> 
  which generally has a shallower pitch to its twist but the names are 
  sometimes used interchangeably. .470 x 1-5/8".<p></p>

<h3>Rotelle (2)</h3> - see <a href="pa_itals.html#076">Ruote</a>.<p></p>

  <p>  
  This pasta spiral resembles the augers used by post hole digging 
  machines. It is similar to <a href="pa_itals.html#031">Fusilli</a> but with a 
  tighter spiral and with two fins instead of three. The photo specimens 
  were 0.53 inch diameter and 1.78 inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>

  <p>
  This pasta, resembling a wagon wheel with spokes and a hub in the 
  center, is available in several sizes. It is good with chunky sauces. 
  <b>Warning:</b> this is a "brand sensitive" pasta, some brands fall 
  apart due to stresses caused by drying too rapidly.  In any case, 
  don't overcook. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Stivaletti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [179; "Little Boots"]
  <br>These are similar to medium elbows, but are abut twice the length 
  and much less curled, though the amount of curl varies with

  <p>  
  A handmade appearing pasta from southern Italy, often served with a 
  simple tomato sauce, basil and shavings of <i>ricotta salata</i> 
  (salted ricotta - much firmer than tub ricotta). 
  photo specimens were roughly 1.55 inches long and 0.90 inches across. 
  and made strascinati are usually thicker and smaller, made by squishing 
  a small lump of dough with the tip of a knife blade, the pulling it off.
  <br class=cll></p>

  <p>
  A flat strip curled on into an "S" shaped cross section to make it look 
  like a rolled up towel. Similar to Casarecci but longer at about 3.5 
  inches by 0.33 inch across. Then name is perhaps suggestive of an old 
  Italian method for handling the priestly child molestation issues we've 
  been dealing with recently.  The photo specimens are extruded through 
  a bronze die for better sauce adhesion.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Succhielli</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;

  <br><img src="img/pa_350succ1h.jpg" alt="Succhielli 350" width="220" height="157" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These were 1.525 inch long by 0.525 across the fins. They are similar 
  to Radiatori but longer and without ruffles on the fins. They are 
  very good for holding sauces.

  <p>  
  This is a complex decorative shape that will also hold medium sauces 
  quite well. They are supposedly shaped like a torch, flaring wide at 
  one end and narrow at the other. The photo specimens were 0.78 inch 
  at the widest and 1.13 inches long.
  <br class=cll></p>


<h3>Tortiglioni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [123]

  <p>  
  This is one of the most complex shapes, very decorative on the plate. 
  It goes well with robust sauces, for instance, <i>Trottole con salmi 
  di lepre</i> (trottole with jugged hare sauce) or <i>Trottole con 
  crema di vodka e gamberi</i> (trottole with vodka cream & shrimp). 
  The photo specimens were 9.5 inches long and 0.58 inch diameter.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tubetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [182]

  <br><img src="img/pa_122ziticut2h.jpg" alt="Cut Ziti 122" width="220" height="198" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This smooth, tubular pasta is similar to penne lisce, but cut straight

  These showed up in a market serving the Yuppie class around Halloween, 
  the name meaning "squash" in Italian. They were 0,9 inch diameter and 
  0.7 inch high. Supprisingly, they held together moderately if not 
  overcooked, but flavor was not outstanding. Made in USA. Ing: Enriched 
  durum flour, dehydrated butternut squash, paprika oleoresins.
