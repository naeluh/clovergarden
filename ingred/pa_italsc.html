<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Italy is the center of the world of Pasta Sauces, so most of our 
information will be about Italian sauces - but the general rules apply 
to sauces of other European regions - most of which developed their 
sauces from Italian practice.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>Asian pasta usage is far different from that of the Western World, 
so it is not considered here.

<h2 id="sauce">The Nature of Italian Sauces</h2>

<p>Most Americans are under the impression that Italian pasta sauces are 
almost all based on tomatoes and need very long cooking. This impression 
is constantly reinforced by the advertising of pasta sauce manufacturers 
- they want to discourage you from making your own sauces, for obvious 
reasons. There is also the matter of Italian-American tradition.</p>

<p>Here we must firmly differentiate between Italian cuisine and 
Italian-American cooking, a matter which distresses visitors from Italy 
to no end. The vast majority of Italian immigrants to North America were 
from the impoverished south of Italy. These people barely knew what food 
was.</p>

<p>These immigrants did, however, know spaghetti. And, in their warm 
homeland, any sauces they made had to be kept simmering day in and day 
out for lack of refrigeration. Also, any meat they could afford was tough, 
possibly even from a retired work horse or water buffalo. It could only 
be tenderized by tossing it in the simmering sauce and leaving it there 
for many hours. This is the basis of Italian-American cooking.</p>

<p>This does not at all jive with real Italian practice. With the 
exception of the Ragu class, most Italian sauces are simple, quickly 
prepared and with short (or even no) cooking time. Emphasis is placed 
on preserving the fresh flavors and light textures of the ingredients. 
Many are based on tomatoes, but many are not.</p><br>

<h2 id="serve">Serving Details</h2>

<p>Here we have a major difference between Italian and North American 
practice, and it greatly affects the use of sauces. This is a life style 
issue and isn't going to change, at least not here.</p>

<p>In Italy, with the exception of certain baked casseroles such 
as Lasagne al Forno and Cannelloni, pasta is not a main dish - it is 
served in a small portion just before the main course. Pasta is not 
always served, often being replaced by Soup (which often contains 
pasta, of course). Both Pasta and Soup are not served at the same 
meal.</p>

<p>In North America, the pasta dish is commonly the main dish, 
preceded or followed by salad, and may share the plate with meat or 
other major items.</p>

<p>All Italian cookbooks tell you to drain the pasta (do NOT rinse), 
not too dry, then stir it together with the sauce and serve 
immediately in shallow heated bowls. The saucing should be light, the 
pasta should not be swimming in it.</p>

<p>Given that, for me, the pasta serving is rarely an accessory, but 
commonly the main dish, I prefer to serve it differently. I return the 
drained pasta to the pot (again, not rinsed and not too dry) and stir 
in a few drops of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (it takes very little) to keep 
the pasta from sticking.</p>

<p>I serve a larger than Italian amount of pasta on deep plates, with a 
big dollop of pasta in the center or off to one side, and garnished as 
I see fit. This also provides a more attractive presentation. The photo 
at top left of this page is an example, but the pasta I serve is often 
intermingled with green beans, wedges of Brussels sprouts, broccoli 
florets, or other attractive accessories.</p>

<p>This method gives a lot more flexibility, and makes it possible to 
add a little more pasta or a little more sauce as desired. It also works 
very well for buffet service, with the pasta in a slow cooker set to 
"keep warm" and a selection of sauces for the guests to choose from.</p>

<p>Of course, in Italy this would be sacrilege - might as well insult 
the Pope! It is held the Olive Oil will keep the sauce from adhering 
to the pasta. Personally, I don't find this much of a problem.</p>

<p>Once again - the saucing is to be fairly light so you can enjoy the 
taste and texture of the pasta itself - not drowning in a flood of 
sauce Italian-American style. Incidentally, "Spaghetti and Meat Balls" 
is unknown in Italy, that's purely Italian-American.</p><br>

<h2 id="shape">Pasta Shapes <small>for</small> Sauces</h2>

<p>There are several factors in choosing an appropriate pasta shape. 
While in Italy, shape to sauce combinations are often dictated by 
regional tradition, we don't have those traditions here and are on 
our own.</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Sauce:</b> &nbsp; How well will the sauce cling to the shape? For 
  light sauces, long thin strands are fine. For chunky meat sauces short 
  shapes or wide flat ribbons are much better.</li>
<li><b>Consistency:</b> &nbsp; How well will the size and shape of the 
  pasta match the size and shape of other ingredients? For pasta with 
  green beans, it's best to select a pasta of similar size and shape 
  to the cut of the beans, for instance.</li>
<li><b>Appearance and Variety:</b> &nbsp; Do you want a decorative 
  shape as a feature, or a plain shape so other ingredients are 
  featured? Fancy shapes go best with light sauces.</li>
<li><b>Colored Pasta:</b> &nbsp; These go best with butter/oil sauces so 
  the colors are featured, not covered by a strongly colored sauce.</li>
<li><b>Setting and Skills:</b> &nbsp; If it's a buffet party with folks 
  wandering around and paying more attention to conversation than to 
  eating, shapes to about 2 inches are best. Also, less experienced 
  pasta eaters may have problems, particularly with spaghetti and full 
  length bucatinti.</li> 
<li><b>Availability:</b> &nbsp; All the shapes photographed for these 
  pages were available in Los Angeles - but other regions may be 
  more impoverished, shape-wise.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="eat">Eating Pasta</h2>

<p>This is not real hard. You do it with a fork. This is particularly 
easy with short pastas. If you have a lumpy sauce, it's easy to get 
some sauce on your fork, then pick up a piece of pasta, stabbing it 
if appropriate.</p>
<p>Long pasta is more of a problem. While, with wide pastas like 
Tagliatelle, cutting into segments with the side of your fork may be 
acceptable, it is not with thinner shapes. </p>
<p>You wind it around the fork against the curve of the plate. Of course 
this is easier with plates that are of modest size and have a definite 
curve at the edges. That's the kind I use for everything - I find the 
current style of American dinner plate much too large (and nutritionists 
consider that large size a factor in the obesity epidemic).</p>
<p>NEVER wind the pasta against a spoon - that's considered totally 
unacceptable in polite circles in Italy, and should be here.</p>
<p>You get it pretty much all wound around the fork. Sucking in cascades 
of pasta with loud slurping sounds may pass muster in Japan, but not 
here.</p>
<p>Choice of shape definitely affects ease of winding. This is why 
I very much prefer linguine to spaghetti, it behaves much better on 
the fork, particularly for the distracted or less experienced, and it 
holds sauces better.</p>
