<h1>Italian Soup Pasta Shapes</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
Italians are quite fond of soup, and combine that with their 
fondness for pasta. Many tiny soup shapes are available, the larger 
for substantial soups and the smallest for broths.

<p><h3>Numbers:</h3> &nbsp; The numbers given here are CloveGarden numbers 
and have no relation to Italian die numbers, which vary with manufacturer.
<p></p>

<h3 id="005">Ancini di Pepe</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [005]
  <br><img src="img/pa_005acinidp1h.jpg" alt="Ancini di Pepe 005" width="220" height="158" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is a small soup pasta made from cylinders cut to a very short 
  length so the length is about the same as the diameter. These were 
  0.90 inch diameter by 0.90 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Alfabeto</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [066; Alphabets]
  <br><img src="img/pa_066alphabet1h.jpg" alt="Alfabeto 066" width="220" height="183" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This is a small soup pasta particularly popular for children's soups. 
  For the photo specimens, "M" size was 0.17 inch wide, 0.22 inch high 
  and 0.08 inch thick.  
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="085">Anelli</h3>
  <br>Small ring shaped pastas used in salads and soups. Larger than 
  anelletti.<p></p>

<h3>Anelletti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [267; tiny rings]
  <br><img src="img/pa_267analletti1h.jpg" alt="Anelletti 267" width="220" height="162" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These tiny rings are intended for use in soups. The photo 
  specimens were 0.48 inch diameter, 0.105 inch thick and had a wall 
  thickness of 0.85 inch. These were made in Italy but packaged 
  "private label" for Trader Joe's.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Anellini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [013; very tiny rings]
  <br><img src="img/pa_013anellini1h.jpg" alt="Anellini 013" width="220" height="174" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These very tiny rings are intended for use in soups. The photo 
  specimens were 0.23 inch diameter and 0.075 inch thick. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Anellonii</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [298; Rings]
  <br><img src="img/pa_298anelloni1h.jpg" alt="Anellonii 298" width="220" height="147" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are generally used in soups. The photo  specimens were 0.50 inch 
  diameter, 0.115 inch thick and had a wall thickness of 0.95 inch
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Astri</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Small soup stars - see 
<a href="pa_italt.html#117">Stelline</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Avena</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; see <a href="pa_italt.html#019">Orzo</a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Caracolito</h3> - Spanish for tiny soup shells, 
  see <a href="pa_italt.html#266">Perline</a>.<p></p>

<h3>Coralli / Corallini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [170]
  <br>Very tiny short soup pasta tubes. Corallini is about 0.14 inch 
  diameter by 0.18 inch long. Coralli is a little larger.<p></p>


<h3>Ditalini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [171; Tiny Thimbles]
  <br><img src="img/pa_171ditelini1h.jpg" alt="Ditalini 171" width="220" height="191" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Under magnification these proved to be ditalini rigate. The photo 
  specimens are very tiny, 0.19 inch long, 0.18 inch diameter. Good 
  particularly for soups. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="270">Elbows, Tiny</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [270]
  <br><img src="img/pa_270elbowtiny2h.jpg" alt="Tiny Elbows 270" width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
  <p>
  These exceptionally small elbows are fine for soups and salads. The 
  photo specimens were 0.46 inch across and 0.12 inch diameter. 
  <br class=cll></p>    


<h3>Farfallini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [084; Soup Bows]
  <br><img src="img/pa_084farfal1h.jpg" alt="Farfallini 084" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>
  This seems rather confused. People call these "Farfallini", but that 
  would imply the same shape as Farfalle, but they are quite different. 
  Perhaps they are a tiny variety of Farfalle Rotonde (farfalle with 
  round ends - very rare - but I found a Turkish company that does call 
  these by that name). Most likely these should actually have been 
  labeled <a href="pa_italt.html#181">Tripolini</a>. Lots of manufacturers admit to 
  making Tripolini in this shape but few list a Farfallini at all. 
  These are for soup, about 0.70 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Filini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [165]
  <br><img src="img/pa_165filini1h.jpg" alt="Filini 165" width="220" height="179" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Tiny soup threads. The photo specimens were about 0.30 inch diameter 
  and 0.50 inch long.
    <br class=cll></p>


<h3>Fregola Sarda</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [120; Fregula]
  <br><img src="img/pa_120fregola1h.jpg" alt="Fregola Sarda 120" width="220" height="188" class=mrg>
  <p>
  "Sardinian Couscous" (0.09 to 0.15" diameter) is though by some to 
  be the ancestor of all Italian dried pastas. Sardinia maintained trade 
  with North Africa for much of its history, so this form may have been 
  brought from there, or taken from there to Africa. Unlike other Italian 
  pastas it is made from a coarser grind of semolina and is lightly oven 
  toasted.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Funghetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [231; Tiny Mushrooms]
  <br><img src="img/pa_231funghetti1h.jpg" alt="Funghetti 231" width="220" height="173" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is one of my favorite forms of soup pasta. Shaped like tiny 
  mushrooms with stems, the photo specimens were 0.41 inch across the 
  cap and 0.28 inch tall. 
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Gnocchetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [067; Gnocchi Picoli]
  <br>A smaller version of the <a href="pa_itals.html#278">Gnocchi</a> 
  pasta. 0.75 inch long, 0.50 inch wide.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Grattoni</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [174]
  <br>Tiny diamond shaped soup pasta. Some brands are made as egg 
  noodles.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Margheritine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [073]
  <br>A smaller version of <a href="pa_itals.html#072">Margherite</a> 
  (daisies) for use in soups.<p></p>

<h3>Occhi di Pernice</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [185]
  <br>Tiny rings.<p></p>

<h3>Orecchiette Piccole</h3> &nbsp;  &nbsp; [306]
  <br><img src="img/pa_306orecchiettep2h.jpg" alt="Orecchiette Piccole 306" width="220" height="173" class=mrg>
  These are much like regular Orecchiette, but significantly smaller (the 
  piccole part). The photo specimens were 0.62 inch diameter and 0.26 inch 
  deep.
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="019">Orzo</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [019; Barley, Avena, Semi di 
    Cicoria, Semi d'orzo, Risetto, Chicchi di Riso, Semini, Puntine, 
    Punte d'ago, Armelline, Occhi di Giudeo, Armellette, Puntalette, 
    Cicorietta, Risetto, Cicorie]
  <br><img src="img/pa_019orzo2h.jpg" alt="Orzo 019" width="220" height="196" class=mrg>
  <p>
  To the North American eye, these don't look at all like barley, but 
  actually, unhulled barley is that shape. What you see sold as "barley" 
  here has been husked and heavily milled (pearled). This pasta is often 
  used to replace rice, as in a rice salad, and is interchangeable with 
  <a href="pa_italt.html#268">Rosmarino</a>. The photo specimens 
  were 0.42 inch long, 0.12 inch wide and 0.06 inch thick. 
  <br class=cll></p>


<h3>Pastina</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [204]
  <br><img src="img/pa_204pastina1h.jpg" alt="Pastina 204" width="220" height="163" class=mrg>
  Tiny soup stars, just .105" across, very popular in children's soups.
  Also used as a generic term for tiny soup pasta 
  (<a href="pa_italt.html#186">Pastine</a>)
  <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="186">Pastine</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [186]
  <br>A generic name for any tiny soup pastas.<p></p>

<h3>Pearl Pasta</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [187]
  <br>Tiny spheres a little larger than 
  <a href="pa_italt.html#005">Acini di Pepe</a>.<p></p>

<h3 id="156">Peperina</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [156; 
  Peppercorns]
  <br><img src="img/pa_156peperina1h.jpg" alt="Peperina 156" width="220" height="206" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Tiny cylinders which cook to about the size of peppercorns. Used mainly 
  in thin soups. The photo specimens were 0.080 inch diameter and random 
  lengths, most shorter than 0.18 inch.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="266">Perline</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [266; 
  Caracolito (Spanish)]
  <br><img src="img/pa_266perline1h.jpg" alt="Perline 266" width="220" height="157" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are actually the very smallest version of shells (Conchiglie) and 
  are intended for use in soups. The photo specimens were 0.27 inch long 
  and 0.22 inch wide.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Rici</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [304; Rice]
  <br><img src="img/pa_304rici1h.jpg" alt="Rici 304" width="220" height="150" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  These are much like <a href="pa_italt.html#019">Orzo</a> but significantly smaller. 
  Their main use would be as a substitute for rice in soups. The photo 
  specimens were 0.25 inch long, 0.105 inch wide and 0.060 inch thick.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="268">Rosmarino</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [268]
  <br><img src="img/pa_268rosmarino1h.jpg" alt="Rosmarino 268" width="220" height="203" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Named for its resemblance to the leaves of the rosemary plant (yes 
  there are some varieties with leaves that short), this pasta is 
  interchangeable <a href="pa_italt.html#019">Orzo</a>. It is often used to replace 
  rice, as in replacing the rice in a salad with pasta.  The photo 
  specimens were 0.38 inch long, 0.125 inch wide and 0.060 inch 
  thick.
  <br class=cll></p>



<h3>Ruedas</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [276; Tiny Wagon Wheels]
  <br><img src="img/pa_276routes2h.jpg" alt="Ruedas 276" width="220" height="161" class=mrg>
  <p>
  I'm using the Spanish name here because I don't yet know what they call 
  this tiny size in Italy. These were made in Mexico, but I find it 
  inconceivable they don't have them in Italy. These are good for soup, 
  0.38 inch diameter, 0.11 inch thick. Yes, the Mexican manufacturer 
  used durum semolina.
  <br class=cll></p>


<h3 id="157">Semi di Cicoria</h3> - Chicory Seeds
  <br>A very tiny rice shaped pasta (.245" x .090") used in thin soups.<p></p>

<h3 id="299">Semi di Melone</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    [299: Melon Seeds; Semilla de Mel&oacute;n (Spanish)]
  <br><img src="img/pa_299semedmel1h.jpg" alt="Semi di Melone 299" width="220" height="143" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Named for its resemblance to the seeds of a melon, this pasta is used 
  for salads and soups similarly to <a href="pa_italt.html#019">Orzo</a>. The photo 
  specimens were 0.23 inch long, 0.13 inch wide and 0.060 inch 
  thick.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Semilla de Mel&oacute;n</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [020: 
    Melon Seeds]
  <br><img src="img/pa_020smelone1h.jpg" alt="Semilla di Melon 020" width="220" height="194" class=mrg>
  <p>
  I've used the Spanish name here because these were made in Mexico. 
  they are much larger than the <a href="pa_italt.html#299">299 Semi di Melone</a>, 
  but I list them here because it is unlikely the Italians don't have 
  this size - the dies probably came from Italy. This is not to say that 
  Mexicans can't make their own dies, but why should they? This pasta is 
  used for salads and soups similarly to <a href="pa_italt.html#019">Orzo</a>. The 
  photo specimens were 0.27 inch long, 0.16 inch wide and 0.050 inch 
  thick.
  <br class=cll></p>


<h3>Stelle</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [178; Stars]
  <br>Stars, larger than Stelline.<p></p>

<h3 id="117">Stelline</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [117; 
    Tiny Stars, Stelle, Stellettine, Astri, Fiori di Sambuco]
  <br><img src="img/pa_117stelline2h.jpg" alt="Stelline 117" width="220" height="184" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This very tiny star shaped pasta is intended for use in soups. The 
  photo specimens were 0.23 inch across the points and 0.070 inch 
  thick.
  <br class=cll></p>


<h3>Stortini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [180 ("<i>f</i>" Form); 302 (elbow form)]
<br>Here we have another major conflict. Some sites, and major Italian 
pasta maker De Cecco (founded 1886) say these have the form of an italic 
lower case <i>f</i>. Other sites and manufacturers say it is a soup 
sized elbow, similar to our <a href="pa_italt.html#270">#270</a>, or even a little 
larger.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h3>Tempestina</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [188]
  <br><img src="img/pa_303tempestina1h.jpg" alt="Tempestina 188" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  This is about as small as pasta gets, similar in size to Moroccan 
  cusecuse. It is used as a soup pasta. The photo specimens were tiny 
  cylinders, 0.075 inch diameter and 0.075 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="181">Tripolini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [181; Soup Bows]
  <br><img src="img/pa_084farfal1h.jpg" alt="Tripolini 181" width="220" height="182" class=mrg>
  <p>
  Tiny soup bows. These are sometimes called "Farfallini" but that 
  seems improper. Most manufacturers list this as "Tripolini" and 
  don't confess to making a Farfallini at all. These are for soup, 
  about 0.70 inch long.
  <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tubetti</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [182]
  <br>Very short smooth tubes, similar to #269 below except without 
  ridges. These are used for salads and thicker soups.<p></p>

<h3>Tubettini</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [126]
  <br><img src="img/pa_126tubettini1h.jpg" alt="Tubettini 126" width="220" height="170" class=mrg>
  <p>  
  Very tiny tubes, about as small as they can get and still have a hole 
  down the center. These are used for soups. The photo specimens were 
  0.130 inch diameter and 0.225 inch long. 
  <br class=cll></p>
