<h1>Ramen Noodles</h1>
<br><img src="img/pa_377ram02g.jpg" alt="Dried Japanese Ramen" class=mrg>
[Chuka Soba (lit. Chinese Soba), Shina Soba (lit. Chinese Soba (depricated)), 
Ramen (from Mandarin Lamian (pulled))]
<p>
These are the "official" Ramen Noodles, and may be straight (usually dried) 
or curly (usually freshly made). Despite "ramen" being derived from "lamian", 
they are cut, not pulled. These are wheat noodles of a type first made in 
Inner Mongolia, near lakes high in sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. 
Containing one or both of these salts is the defining difference between 
ramen noodles and other wheat noodles. These salts help the noodles stay 
firm and springy in hot soup.</p>
<p>Chinese immigrants brought these noodles to Yokohama, Japan possibly by 
1859. The first Japanese owned shop to serve ramen presented in a Japanese 
style opened in 1910, employing cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown. Stories 
about ramen coming to Japan much earlier have not a shred of supporting 
evidence.</p>
<p>Ramen noodles are used in Ramen Soups. These are assembled soups, noodles 
in the bowl, broth poured over, toppings placed on the surface. Every 
province has its own style and special toppings. The Broth is usually from 
meat, but sometimes fish, and is usually clear, but in some provinces, Miso 
is included.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Instant Ramen</h2>
<p></p>


<p>"Instant Noodles" were invented by Momofuku Ando in 1958. He founded the 
company now known as Nissin Foods. The company started distributing the 
first "Instant Ramen" in Japan in 1968, as a way something similar to ramen 
soup could be easily made in the home just by adding boiling water. the 
product line was quickly expanded, and was being exported to the United 
States by 1972.<p> 

<h2>Japanese - American Ramen</h2>

<p><img src="img/pa_ramenp05d.jpg" alt="Block of Meruchan Ramen with Broth Package" class=mrg>
This is what Ramen is to most Americans, having never known any other form, 
except the same thing in cups. American Ramen has been heavily criticized as 
a junk grade product, but it's not our fault. The Japanese have had a romance 
with packaged "convenience food" products since the fall of their empire - 
and all three major brands sold here are Japanese. Nissin Foods ("Top Ramen, 
Cup Noodles"); Maruchan ("Maruchan Ramen"); Sanyo Foods ("Sapporo Ichiban"). 
They all started importing these products from Japan in the early 1970s, and 
set up manufacturing the very same products here in the mid 1970s.</p>

<p>But, we must not harsh these products too severely, as they have provided 
the major mid-day nutrition to two generations of college students, computer 
programmers, tech nerds, and gamers. This is a demographic who's three major 
food groups are caffeine, sugar, and salt, with a side of fat. Flavor is not 
an issue if there is sufficient salt.</p>    

<p>The photo to the left is typical. It has a long list of ingredients, of 
which the very last and least is "cooked chicken powder". The product weighed 
in at 3 ounces, and cost 2022 US $0.69. Instructions are to boil 2 cups of 
water, stir in noodles for 3 minutes, turn off heat, and stir in broth powder. 
Actually 4 minutes would be better, and it could stand another 1/4 cup of 
water. the noodle block was 4-1/4 x 3-3/4 x 1 inch and weighed 2.9 ounces.<p>

<p>OK, I confess to occasionally eating this type Ramen for lunch when I'm 
working hard at the computer. This is my formula. Make a thin cut at the top 
of the envelope and remove the broth package. Leave the cookie in the envelope 
and pound it with a kitchen mallet until the noodles are quite small. Put 
2-2/3 cups water in a pan and crush in 1 hot Thai dried chili (or 3 Aji 
Charapita - or whatever will match "extra spicy" at a Thai restaurant). 
Bring to a boil and pour in the noodles. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the 
Broth Powder. Serve.

<h2>Korean Instant Noodles</h2>

<p><img src="img/pa_ramenp08f.jpg" alt="Block of Korean Instant Noodles" class=mrg>
Fortunately, we have a very favorable alternative to these Japanese-American 
products. Here in the multi-ethnic markets of Southern California, Korean 
Instant Noodle products are gaining major shelf space. Pictured to the left is 
a Korean version of "Instant Noodle with Chicken Flavored Spicy Soup". The 
Koreans don't call it "ramen" because they're still really, really pissed off 
at the Japanese for their horrid wartime atrocities (and who isn't). Besides, 
Korea is way closer to Inner Mongolia and probably "ramen" noodles centuries 
before the Japanese got them. This particular product has a bit of chili bite, 
just enough to be acceptable here in Southern California, where soup without 
a touch of chili is nearly unthinkable.</p>

<p>The package weighs in at 4-1/4 ounces, and calls for the same 2 cups of 
water as the Japanese, but I wouldn't use less than 3 cups. The package 
claims simmering for 4 minutes, but 5 is better. The noodle block measures 
5 x 4 x 1 inches and weighs 3.8 ounces.</p>

<p>This package cost just under 2022 US $1.00 per package, in sets of 5. 
Some other Korean Instant Noodle products are a little higher, but the 
price rewards you with superior product - more than worth it.

<p><img src="img/pa_ramenp02f.jpg" alt="Korean Spicy Seafood Noodles " class=mrg>
<p>Here is my all-time favorite, <b>Neoguri Spicy Seafood Flavor Udon Type 
Noodles</b> - (Nongshim). When I first started buying it, many years ago, I 
used it as instructed on the package, except breaking up the noodles so I 
could easily eat them with a spoon, and using about 3 cups of water instead 
of 2. I was delighted with it.</p>

<p>Today, I start by pouring the herbal package into the pot, then crush in 
some really hot chilis to spice it up a but - two Thai type chilis, or 5 
Aji Charipita (tiny, but very hot). I put in about 5 cups of water. Then I 
check my freezer compartment for bits and pieces of seafood. I use at least 
3 of Shrimp, Fish, Clams, Squid, Cuttlefish, Sea Cucumber, Fish Balls, and 
sometimes pieces of rice cake. I thaw them and cut them up as needed,</p>

<p>After bringing the pot to a boil, I break up the Noodles and stir them in. 
After it comes back to a boil, I add the seafood, and a little water if 
needed to bring it to 6 cups. When it boils again, I add the broth powder 
and serve. Yum!
