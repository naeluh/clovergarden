<p><span class=bg>Rice Cakes, though made of the same ingredients as 
<a href="pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a>, are treated separately 
here because their manner of usage is different. They are widely used in 
Southeast Asia, China, and Korea. Here in Los Angeles, several sizes and 
shapes are available fresh or frozen in Asian and Korean markets. Some 
shapes can also be made easily at home, such as the cake in the photo to 
the left, made by our recipe <a href="../recipes/sin_ricak1.html">
<b>Rice Cake</b></a>. Fresh is best, but must generally be used the same 
day or the next.</span></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Many Asian markets here in Los Angeles have fresh 
Rice Cakes available. Due to the conclusion of a long battle between Asian 
markets and the California Food Safety people, these products can be shelved 
unrefrigerated, but for only one day. Refrigeration stiffens these products.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; Because fresh Rice Cakes are stiffened by 
refrigeration, they should be used the day purchased, or the next day. Beyond 
that, they go to mold, which is not dangerous, but definitely changes the 
flavor. Some products are now available in sterile vacuum packaging (heavier 
plastic and tightly wrapped). These may be good for a number of days at room 
temperature, but once opened will start to mold in a day.
<p></p>

<h3 id="cfroz">Cooking Frozen:</h3> &nbsp; If simply set out to thaw, Rice 
Cakes will quickly crack and start to crumble. The way to handle them is to 
bring enough water to cover them well to a boil. If they have ice, rinse 
them in hot running water to remove it. Dump them into the boiling water 
and turn off the heat. Depending on thickness, they will be ready in 30 
minutes to an hour.

<p>After this soaking, they will still be stiff, but can be more easily 
sliced. They will need 10 to 20 minutes of cooking, depending on thickness.

<h2 id="373">Fresh Rice Cake Block</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_373riblk02e.jpg" alt="Fresh Rice Noodle Block" class=mrg>
[373, B&aacute;nh B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n (Viet - "Flour for B&ocirc;t 
Chi&ecirc;n")]
<p>This form is increasingly available in the Asian markets here in 
Los Angles (2019). It is essential for a very famous Vietnamese recipe 
for B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n, see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/smn_ricakeg1.html"><b>Fried Rice Cake with Eggs</b></a>. 
This Rice Cake can also be used to cut noodles that are a little thicker than 
the 0.040 inch (1 mm) thickness of Fresh Rice Paper Sheets. The photo specimen 
was 6 x 3 x 2-1/2 inches and weighed 2 pounds.</p>
<p>I have found that for frying for B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n, commercial 
blocks fry much more quickly after a night in the fridge. We also have 
a recipe for making this <a href="../recipes/sin_ricak1.html">
<b>Rice Cake</b></a> yourself, it is easy to do. 
<br class=cll><p>


<h2>Rice Cake Ovals</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pa_336rioval02e.jpg" alt="Oval Rice Noodles 336" class=mrg>
[336, Rice Ovalettes, Rice Cake;   Nian Gao (China); Dduk (Korea)]
<p>
Originally developed in Ningbo in Zhejiang, China, these are now very popular 
through China, and especially Korea. They are often used in stir fries and 
soups. They are available fresh, dried, semi-dried in sterile vacuum packs, 
refrigerated, or frozen. For frozen, see instructions <a href="pa_riccz.html#cfroz">
<b>Cooking Frozen</b></a>. The semi-dried are usually simmered for about 10 
minutes to prepare them for stir fry, the fresh several minutes less. The 
dried needs to be soaked overnight, then cooked like the semi-dried. The 
photo specimens, semi-dried, made in USA, were typically 1.9 inches long, 
1 inch across and 0.19 inch thick, cut diagonally from a 1 inch diameter 
cylinder. Sweet Rice, Salt, Water, Wheat Starch (wheat starch is gluten 
free, but versions without that ingredient can be had).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Cake Sticks</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pa_345rcake2h.jpg" alt="Cylindrical Rice Cakes" class=mrg>
[345, Tteokguk-yong-tteok (Korea)]
<p>
These are quite popular in Korea, where they are made up with a mild chili 
sauce and sold by street vendors as a snack. They are also often sliced for 
use in various recipes. The photo specimens were 2 inches long and 1/2 inch 
diameter, purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles, refrigerated in a 
23 ounce vacuum packed bag. Korean markets also often have them fresh. If 
frozen, see <a href="pa_riccz.html#cfroz"><b>Cooking Frozen</b></a>. Ingred: Rice, Salt, 
Water.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Cake Peanuts</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pa_375ripea01h.jpg" alt="Peanut shaped Rice Cakes" class=mrg>
[375 (Korea)]
<p>
These work well in soups, the peanut shape making them quite easy to pick up 
with chopsticks. Since they are sold frozen, see <a href="pa_riccz.html#cfroz"><b>Cooking 
Frozen</b></a> for preparation. The photo specimens were 1.25 inches long and 
0.65 inch wide, purchased from a Korean market in Los Angeles 
(La Ca&ntilde;ada), frozen in a 23 ounce vacuum bag.  Ingred: Rice, Salt, 
Water.
