<h1>Rice Noodles - Rice Stick</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>Rice noodles are widely used in every Asian region 
where rice is grown and eaten. Not long ago, in North America, even 
here in Los Angeles, they were available in only a couple sizes and 
only dried. Now vast quantities of fresh noodles are produced in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, and every Asian market has at least one 
or two varieties - others have fifteen or more. Dried are available 
in a couple of dozen forms and sizes as well. While made from the same 
ingredients, <a href="pa_riccz.html"><b>Rice Cakes</b></a> have their 
own page, as they are handled differently.</span></p>

<h2>Caution:</h2><span class=bg> &nbsp; Rice Noodles must never be 
confused with Bean Thread Noodles. They look about the same dried, 
but their cooking characteristics are very  different. Read the label.
</span>
<p></p><span class=bg>These products are generally labeled in Vietnamese, 
Chinese, Thai and English. The names I give are English and Vietnamese 
(some diacritical marks omitted), because the Thai and Chinese 
characters are uninterpretable to me.</span>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking <small>&amp;</small> Storing Rice Noodles</h2>

<p>Whether fresh or dried, rice noodles are fully cooked. Most need only 
enough cooking time to heat them up, some (mostly soaked dried ones) need 
a few minutes, but the thickest dried ones may need 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>Storing, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Rice Noodles of all types should just 
be stored in a sealed plastic bag to exclude dust and insects - though 
insects seem little interested in dried rice noodles.<p></p>

<h3>Storing, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; <b>Don't Refrigerate</b>, as it 
severely changes their texture, making them impossible to unwrap if in 
sheets. In their sealed package at a cool room temperature they will 
still be fine the day after purchase. Some forms are now shipped in 
sterile packaging (heavier plastic, tightly wrapped). These may remain 
good for a number of days at room temperature. Open packages will start 
to mold in a day.<p></p>

<h3>Fresh / Dried Ratio:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh and dry are interchangeable 
for many uses. If the recipe calls for fresh, use 1/2 the weight dry. 
If the recipe calls for dry, 2 times the weight fresh.<p></p>

<h3>Timing, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; Soak in a heatproof bowl, with plenty of 
hot water poured over. The thinnest (fine 0.020 in / 0.5 mm) may take 
as little as 5 minutes and almost no cooking time. the thickest (0.070 
in / 1.8 mm) a good hour soaking and up to 15 minutes simmer. Medium 
and wider (0.025 / 0.65 mm x 0.375 / 10 mm) 45 minutes soak and around 
4 minutes cooking. Over-soaking is not a problem, they can be kept in 
the soaking water for hours - over-cooking is a problem.<p></p>

<h3>Timing, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; Not much more then just getting them up 
to recipe temperature.<p></p>

<h3>Wet Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Unlike Bean Starch noodles, these will 
start falling apart if cooked much more than the minimum required. Add 
them to recipes in the last minutes. Soaked dried noodles, especially 
larger sizes, are often cooked separately from the recipe and added 
to it at the last moments. I set a strainer over a heatproof catch bowl 
or pot, then drop the noodles into the boiling water. When ready (time 
depends on thickness), dump them out through the strainer. Noodles can 
go directly from the strainer to the recipe, but if they need to be held, 
rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Reheat briefly when needed.
Hot water in the catch bowl can be returned to the cooking pot for more 
noodles, or to be ready to reheat cold ones.<p></p>

<h3 id="fry">Stir Fry:</h3> &nbsp; This is tricky because thin noodles 
can start to stick to the pan almost immediately, and then start to 
break up. Basically, when the stir fry is otherwise done, quickly spread 
the noodles over the top, then tumble them in as quickly as possible 
and serve immediately.

<p>Soaked dried noodles are a bit more forgiving than fresh, and ones 
just a little thicker are easier than the thinnest. Most unforgiving 
are fresh noodles unrolled and cut from Rice Rolls (<a href="pa_ricez.html#370">
<b>370</b></a> and <a href="pa_ricez.html#371"><b>371</b></a>. I've had less trouble 
with <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/363"><b>363</b></a>, but that may not always be the case.
I suspect Thai restaurants use a fresh wide noodle a little thicker 
than common in the markets. Of course, if you have a  
<a href="pa_riccz.html#373"><b>Rice Cake Block</b></a> you can slice 
them to the thickness you want.</p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg id="dry">Varieties - Dried</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Spring Roll Wrappers</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_221banhtrang01e.jpg" alt="Banh Trang Spring Roll Wrappers" class=mrg>
[221 B&aacute;nh Trang (Viet)
<p>
These are used in Thailand and Vietnam to make various spring rolls, both 
fresh and deep fired. They are extremely thin and take practice handling. 
The photo specimens are 8-1/2 inches diameter and 0.007 inch / 0.18 mm 
thick (yes, that's 7 thousandths of an inch).</p>
<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These will be found 
in any market serving a Southeast Asian community. Store in a sealed bag 
to prevent entry of insects and they will last indefinitely.<p></p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>: &nbsp; These are first moistened just enough to make 
them flexible. I do this either by laying them on a damp cloth and 
brushing them with water or setting them on a plate full of water (one 
at a time). In a few seconds they're ready to use. They are then folded 
and rolled into packets which may be served as-is or deep fried depending 
on the recipe used. Handling them takes a little practice.	Full details, 
including step-by-step photo gallery, will be found in our recipes 
<a href="../recipes/sav_summer1.html"><b>Summer Rolls</b></a> and 
<a href="../recipes/sam_spring1.html"><b>Spring Rolls</b></a>.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Rice Flake</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_219riceflk01e.jpg" alt="Rice Flake" class=mrg>
[219, B&aacute;nh Uot, B&aacute;nh Cu&ocirc;n (Viet); Guay Jub (Thai)]
<p>
These are easily available in Los Angeles but may be scarce in other parts 
of the country. The photo specimens, made in Thailand, are B&aacute;nh 
Uot, 2 inch x 2 inch random squares 0.025 inch thick. I have also found 
B&aacute;nh Cu&ocirc;n, made in Vietnam, which are 1.3 x 1.9 inch random 
rectangles 0.020 inch thick. Both are used in certain soups in Vietnam, 
but they will also work in the famous Thai Beef with Broccoli stir fry, 
and are easier to work with than fresh rice noodles.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Vermicelli - Fine</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_009ricestk12e.jpg" alt="Fine Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
[009, B&aacute;nh Hoi (Viet), Sen Mee (Thai); Mee Hoon, Bi Hun (Malay); 
Rice Stick]
<p>
The name "B&aacute;nh Hoi" can be a bit confusing, because it also is 
the name used for the roving forms, both dried (<a href="pa_ricez.html#360">
<b>360</b></a>) and fresh (<a href="pa_ricez.html#362"><b>362</b></a>), which are also 
called "Fine Rice Vermicelli" in English. There is actually a steaming 
method for making this form into an imitation of the roving form. These 
rice noodles are about 0.020 inch (0.5 mm) diameter and sold in skeins 
weighing from 3.5 to 4 ounces. This form soaks in only 4 to 5 minutes in 
warm water. It can be given a quick dip in boiling water, then rinsed 
in cold water and is ready for recipes. They are often used in salads 
and the like, but this form can be used in soups and stir fries if 
cooking time is very short.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Noodle - Thin</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_222bunquelam01d.jpg" alt="Fine Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
[222, B&uacute;n Que Lam, B&uacute;n Giang T&acirc;y Soi Nho (Viet); 
Rice Stick]
<p>
B&uacute;n Giang T&acirc;y means "Straight Rice Noodles", Soi Nho means 
"Thin". These are 0.04 inch diameter (1 mm), straight and cut to a 
length of 7-3/4 inches. These were made in China, and are very popular in 
Guilin city in the Guangxi region of China. That's just across Vietnam's 
northern border, and these were obviously packaged with the Vietnamese 
market in mind.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Noodle - B&uacute;n B&ograve; Hu&ecirc;</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_364rivunbo1d.jpg" alt="Bo Hue Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
[364, B&uacute;n B&ograve; Hu&ecirc; (Viet); Rice Stick]
<p>
These are relatively large rice noodles, 0.070 inch diameter (1.8 mm) 
and 18.5 inches long. They are for use in B&uacute;n B&ograve; Hu&ecirc;, 
a popular spicy Vietnamese beef (b&ograve;) soup, originating from the 
city of Hu&ecirc; in central Vietnam. These take a 60 minute soak in 
warm water, followed by boiling for 10 to 15 minutes. They are cooked 
separately from the soup and added at serving. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="374">Rice Noodles - Narrow (2 mm)</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_374ri2mm02d.jpg" alt="Dried Narrow 2mm Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>[374 B&aacute;nh Pho Vi&ecirc;et Mien L&agrave;o; (Viet); Rice Sticks]
</p><p>
The name B&aacute;nh Pho indicates they are flat, and expected to be used 
in the famous Vietnamese soup "Pho", but wider noodles also carry this 
name. Noodles like these may be used in Pho in South Vietnam, while wider 
ones are liked in North Vietnam. I have used these successfully for Pad 
Thai. These were 0.08 inches wide by 0.03 thick (2 mm x 0.75 mm) and sold 
in 7 ounce skeins. Soaking time is about 30 minutes. Product of Thailand. 
Ing: rice, water.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="365">Rice Noodles - Narrow (3 mm)</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_365riphokho3d.jpg" alt="Dried Narrow 3mm Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>[365 B&aacute;nh Pho Kho; Chantaboon, Janta boon, Sen Lek, Sen, Chan, 
Guay Tiew Chantaburi (Thai); Rice Sticks]
</p><p>
The name B&aacute;nh Pho indicates they are flat, and expected to be used 
in the famous Vietnamese soup "Pho" (Kho means dried), but wider noodles 
also carry this name. Noodles like these are used in Pho in South Vietnam, 
while wider ones are liked in North Vietnam. These were 0.125 inches 
wide by 0.025 thick (3 x 0.64 mm) and sold in 7 ounce skeins. Soaking 
time is about 40 minutes. Product of Vietnam. Ing: rice flour, tapioca 
starch, water, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rice Noodles - Wide (10 mm)</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_220ricew5e.jpg" alt="Dried Wide Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>[220 B&aacute;nh Pho Kho; Chantaboon, Janta boon, Sen Yai (Thai); 
Rice sticks, Ho fun (Cantonese); Shahe fen (Mandarin).]
</p><p>
These are the widest rice noodles commonly found in the Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles. The name B&aacute; Pho indicates they are flat, and 
expected to be used in the famous Vietnamese soup "Pho", but narrower 
noodles also carry this name. Noodles this wide may be used in North 
Vietnamese pho, but narrow ones are used in South Vietnam. These were 
0.375 inches wide by 0.025 thick. This noodle will expand to about 0.45 
inches wide when fully soaked in warm water (about 45 minutes) and 
briefly cooked. Product of Thailand. Ing: rice flour, water, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="360">Rice Fine Vermicelli Roving - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_360rvr2e.jpg" alt="Fine Rice Vermicelli Roving Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>[360, B&aacute;nh Hoi (Viet)]
</p><p>
These sheets of dried fine rice vermicelli measured 2-3/4 x 4 inches and 
0.15 inch thick. Instructions are not specific as to use, however, the 
photo on the front of the package shows them rolled up as wrappers. 
Soak in boiling water 20 seconds, and let drain for 3 minutes. They 
remain quite intact.</p>
<p>They are most often served as little rolls, almost 
always sprinkled with briefly fried Garlic Chives, and sometimes dried 
shrimp. They accompany roast duck, roast pork belly, grilled beef and 
similar items. These were purchased from a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $1.29 for 12 ounces. Ing: rice 
flour, water, salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="361">Rice Noodle Shapes - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_361rishl1e.jpg" alt="Small Rice Noodle Shells" class=mrg>
[361, Nui Gao (Viet)]
<p>Rice flour dough is not nearly as suitable for complex shapes as 
duram wheat dough, but a few simple shapes are made and to be found in 
Asian markets. Most commonly are these tiny shells, and small tubes. 
these shells were 0.4 inches long. Ingred: rice four 86%, tapioca starch 
13%, salt, pentasodium triphosphate.
<br class=cll></p>

<p></p>


<h2 class=lrg id="fresh">Varieties - Fresh</h2>

<p>While all the dried rice noodles on this page were made in Vietnam, 
Thailand, and China, all the fresh ones were, of necessity, made in 
Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California. Local delivery is critical 
for these, and they are consumed in great quantity by the huge 
Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, and Korean communities in the region, as 
well as a fast growing enthusiasm for Asian cuisines by other 
Californians.</p>

<h2 id="373">Fresh Rice Cakes</h2>
<br><a href="pa_riccz.html">
<img src="img/pa_373riblk02c.jpg" alt="Fresh Rice Noodle Block" class=mrg></a>
<p>Fresh blocks, sticks, ovals and other solid forms, fresh, dried, or frozen, 
have their own <a href="pa_riccz.html"><b>Rice Cakes</b></a> page, as they 
are handled differently from noodles.
<br class=cll><p>

<h2 id="370">Fresh Rice Paper - Noodle Sheets</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pa_370riuotp01e.jpg" alt="Fresh Rice Noodle Sheets" class=mrg>
<p>[370, Rice Roll; B&aacute;nh Uot ("Wet Cake" - Viet), B&aacute;nh 
M&oacute;ng ("Thin Cake" - Viet)]
</p><p>
These are found in markets serving Asian communities, from Korean on 
south to Indonesian. The Korean markets around here generally have only 
the sheet form, but markets serving Southeast Asian communities may have 
more than 10 varieties of cut sheet and other fresh rice noodles.<p></p>
<p>The photo shows uncut sheets called <b>B&aacute;nh M&oacute;ng</b>. 
These are in the form of long sheets stacked and folded, but some makers 
sell stacks of sheets cut to package size. The sheets are very thin and 
coated with oil so they can be separated from the bundle. Sheets of the 
photo specimen were 0.03 inch (0.76 mm) thick. The bundle was about 
6-1/2 x 4-1/2 inches and weighed 1.5 pounds. Ing: rice, water, wheat 
starch, cotton seed oil, salt, sodium sulphate, sodium benzoate.</p>
<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These are intended 
to be purchased and used on the day they are made, but will still be OK 
the following day or a little more if unopened - after that, they will 
start to mold and get a strange taste.<p></p>
<h3>Do not refrigerate.</h3> &nbsp; Refrigeration changes the texture of 
the noodles and they will break up when you try to peel them off the 
bundle, even if you have warmed them back up. A major battle was fought 
in California between Asian markets and the Health Department. The 
Health Department finally yielded to the extent that Rice products may 
be displayed and sold without refrigeration, but only for one day.

<h2 id=371>Fresh Rice Paper Roll, Long</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_371bancuon06f.jpg" alt="Long Rice Paper Roll" class=mrg>
[371, B&aacute; Cu&ocirc;n Rice Cake Rolled]
<p>
These are the same as #370, except rolled from a very wide sheet, up to 
30 inches wide. The photo specimen was 0.040 inch (1 mm) thick All other 
conditions and handling are exactly as for the sheet form 
<a href="pa_ricez.html#370"><b>Rice Roll</b></a> described above. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Fresh Rice Paper Roll <small>with</small> Chives <small>&amp;</small> Dried Shrimp</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_372banhcuon2f.jpg" alt="Long Rice Paper Roll" class=mrg>
<p>[372, B&aacute; Cu&ocirc;n Rice Cake Rolled]
</p><p>
This is the same as #371, except embedded with Garlic Chives and dried 
shrimp. It is apparently quite popular with the Vietnamese community, 
as almost every market that has #371 also has this form. .040 inch (1 mm) 
thick.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=363>Fresh Rice Noodles - Rice Paper Precut</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_363riphow3f.jpg" alt="Precut Fresh Rice Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>[363; B&aacute;nh Pho T&uacute;&oacute;i]
</p><p>
These are precut fresh rice noodles (T&uacute;&oacute;i means "fresh"), 
basically a sliced Rice Roll - but the Rice Roll sheets may be thicker 
than the full sheet ones. They are available in several widths - 
you just need to unfold and pull them apart for use (a little tedious, 
but necessary). Do this well before cooking - there won't be time later. 
All other conditions and handling are exactly as for the 
sheet form <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/371"><b>Rice Roll</b></a> described above. The 
photo specimens were 0.4 inches (10 mm) wide, 0.04 inch (1 mm) thick 
and 20 inches long.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Fresh Soup Noodles, Thick - B&aacute; Caneh</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_368rigaoloc3d.jpg" alt="Thick Round Rice Soup Noodles" class=mrg>
<p>This is a family of thick noodles used in various soups (Caneh), all 
sold fresh in plastic bags. They vary a bit in composition, but the 
names following "B&aacute;nh Canh" aren't very helpful. An important 
difference is the ratio between rice flour and tapioca starch. The more 
tapioca compared to rice flour, the more firm and chewy the noodle. Here 
are several of them. The photo is of B&aacute;nh Canh B&ocirc;t Gao Loc, 
but they all look pretty much the same.</p>

<h3>B&aacute;nh Canh B&ocirc;t Gao Loc:</h3> &nbsp; "Filtered Rice 
Flour" Stays quite chewy in soup. 0.250 inch diameter. Ing: Rice Four, 
Tapioca Starch, Water, Soy Bean Oil, Salt, Sodium Benzoate.<p></p>

<h3>B&aacute;nh Canh Doc:</h3> &nbsp; "Opaque" - quite tender in soup.
0.200 inch diameter. Rice, Wheat Starch, Potato Starch, Water, Sodium 
Benzoate.<p></p> 

<h3>B&aacute;nh Canh Trong:</h3> &nbsp; "In" - These stayed medium firm 
in soup, but don't quite qualify as "rice noodles". 0.190 inch diameter. 
Ing: Water, wheat starch, potato starch, sodium benzoate.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="362">Fine Rice Vermicelli Roving - Fresh</h2>
<br><img src="img/pa_362rirov5e.jpg" alt="Fresh Fine Rice Vermicelli Pad" class=mrg>
[362: B&aacute;nh Hoi T&uacute;&oacute;i (Viet)]
<p>
This Vietnamese form is a bit unusual, composed of a roving of very thin 
strands. It's sold in 3-1/4 x 5 inch pads, around 0.2 inch thick, as 
shown in the photo, but also in the Rice Roll form, in which case it 
is thinner and looser, looking rather like cheesecloth.</p>
<p>They are used 
"as is", as even a second in hot water and they disintegrate. They 
are most often served as little rolls or squares, almost always 
sprinkled with briefly fried Garlic Chives, and sometimes dried shrimp. 
They accompany roast duck, roast pork belly, grilled beef and similar 
items.</p>

<p>In my experiments, I have deep fried squares of both forms until 
light golden. This produces something like vegetarian pork rinds. They 
are crispy, and have a taste suggestive of Rice Crispys (unsweetened).
