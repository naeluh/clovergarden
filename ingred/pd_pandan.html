<h1>Pandanus - Screwpine</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Family <i>Pandanaceae</i> consists of branching, strap-leafed 
Monocot plants, some of which can grow up to 60 feet tall. They are 
commonly called "screwpines" because of their spiral growth habit, even 
though they are not related to pines. They are characterized by aerial 
prop roots which buttress and stabilize the trunk as it becomes top-heavy 
with leaves and fruit. There are two major genera, <i>Pandanus</i>, which 
are free standing and tree-like, and <i>Freycinetia</i>, which are 
vine-like tree climbing plants.
</p>
<p>Most pandanus are used mainly for thatch, making mats, ropes 
and other craft and utilitarian products. Leaves of one species are much 
used in Southeast Asia as a flavoring, and fruits of several others are 
eaten in their native regions.

<h2>Pandan</h2>

<p>
Strangely, this is the only pandanus with fragrant leaves, and they lack 
the dangerous sawtooth edges typical of pandanus. It also does not exist 
in the wild because it is sterile. Male flowers are extremely rare and 
female flowers have never been recorded by botanical science. It is, 
however, widespread through Southeast Asia by cultivation, propagated 
by cuttings. It is a small pandanus growing to a maximum of about 6 feet.
</p> 
<p>Pandan is predominantly used to flavor rice and sweet deserts. For 
sweets pandan extract is often used rather than the leaves, and it's 
often dyed a brilliant (hideous) green, the kind of colors Asians seem 
to like in their desserts. Pandan leaves are also used to wrap chicken 
before frying, lending it a light aromatic flavor.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Pandan leaves are widely available in the forzen 
food cases of Asian markets. They are usually full strap leaves about 19 
inches long, but may also appear folded or in other forms.

<h2>Hala</h2>

[Hala tree (Hawaii); <i>Pandanus tectorius</i>]
<p>The exact origin of this tree is unknown as it was taken by Polynesians 
as far south as southeastern Australia and as far east as Hawaii. It is a 
medium size tree growing to about 45 feet and bears fruit up to nearly 8 
inches diameter and 12 inches long.</p>
<p>The fruit of this tree, raw or cooked, is a very important food source 
through most of Micronesia where most food plants won't grow. It is not 
favored in Hawaii but has been eaten there in times of scarcity. The leaves, 
stripped of their toothy edges, were used in Hawaii to make grass skirts and 
woven into mats. Less carefully de-toothed leaves were used to thatch 
roofs.

<h2>Kiekie</h2>

[<i>Freycinetia banksii</i>]
<p>
Native to New Zealand, this pandanus is a tree climbing vine rather 
than a tree. In other characteristics, including aerial roots, it resembles 
the tree forms. If they can't find convenient trees to climb they make a 
tangled mass on the ground. The fruit is sweet and the flower bracts succulent, and both 
were appreciated by the native Maori in past times. Of course they also used 
the leaves for craft materials just as other populations used their pandanus.

<h2>Red Fruit</h2>

[Kuansu (Papua); Buah merah (Indonesia); <i>Pandanus conoideus</i>]
<p>
Endemic to Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea) this pandanus produces 
elongated red fruits which may grow longer than 3 feet and 7 inches 
diameter. The fruits are edible and are typically split, wrapped in 
leaves and baked in an earth oven. Some are promoting it as having 
anti-AIDS properties, but there is no organized evidence for this.

<p>
This pandanus is found from southern India to Taiwan and the Ryukyu 
Islands. Its aromatic male flowers are processed into flower essences 
used to flavor food, mainly in northern India. they are also used to make 
perfumes, aromatic oils and medicinal distillates. Kewra water is 
interchangeable with other flower essences such as rose and orange water. 
The flowers are reputed to attract snakes.
