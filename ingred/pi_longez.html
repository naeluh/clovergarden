<h1>Long Pepper - Ethiopian</h1>
<br><img src="img/pi_longe02g.jpg" alt="Dried Ethiopian Long Pepper Seed Heads" class=mrg>
[African Long Pepper; Timiz (Ethiopia);<i>Piper capense</i>]
<p>This pepper, related to the round black pepper, produces loose seed spikes 
embedded with many tiny peppercorns, each inside a fruit capsule. The plant is 
native to moist regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Sierra Leone on the 
Atlantic coast to the Ethiopian highlands in East Africa. It is found south 
as far as Angola, Tanzania and South Africa.</p>
<p>The seed heads of this pepper are used as a spice mostly in Ethiopia and 
Eritrea, but the plant is gathered in the wild for medicinal use in other 
parts of Africa. The seed heads are <u>not</u> interchangeable with 
<a href="pi_longiz.html"><b>Indian Long Pepper</b></a> as they are much 
milder and sweeter. Their flavor and hotness is more similar to Cloves and 
Cardamom than to black pepper. The photo specimens were up to 0.25 inch 
diameter and 1.9 inches long (6.4 x 48 mm).

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product is available in some Ethiopian 
markets in North America, but is also available on-line. It is much less 
available than Indian Long Pepper, with which it is not interchangeable.
The photo specimens were purchased on-line for 2021 US $5.00 per ounce 
(plus shipping). The Ethiopian markets in Los Angeles County are quite 
inconvenient for me to get to, so I have not checked them out yet.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  This spice is simply ground whole and added to 
various spice mixes, or directly into soups and stews.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; About 1/3 each Black Pepper, Cardamom and Cloves is 
pretty close, but noticeably sweeter.<p></p>
