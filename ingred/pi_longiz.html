<h1>Long Pepper - Indian</h1>
<br><img src="img/pi_long01g.jpg" alt="Dried Indian Long Pepper Seed Heads" class=mrg>
[Long Pepper; Pipli, Pippali (India); <i>Piper longum</i>]
<p>This pepper, native to India, is related to the round black pepper, but 
instead of separate berries, produces very tight seed spikes embedded with 
many tiny peppercorns.</p>
<p>This pepper was known in ancient Greece, but as a medicinal. It was used 
as an important seasoning in Rome, interchangeable with Black Pepper, both 
called <i>Piper</i>. It was much used in Medieval Europe in mixes called 
"Strong powder", but by the 14th century it had been largely displaced by 
Black Pepper. It is still used in vegetable pickles and the like in India and  
Nepal, in cooking in Malaysia and Indonesia,  and in North African spice 
mixes. The photo specimens were up to 0.27 inch diameter and 1.7 inches 
long (6.9 x 43 mm).

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While not found in supermarkets or produce markets in 
North America, this spice is commonly available in Indian markets and on-line. 
Note that it is <u>not</u> interchangeable with the much less available 
<a href="pi_longez.html"><b>Ethiopian Long Pepper</b></a>. The photo 
specimens were purchased on-line for 2021 US $1.85 per ounce (plus shipping). 
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  This spice is simply ground whole and added to 
various spice mixes, or directly into soups and stews.
<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Black Pepper, but a little more as this pepper is 
sharper.

<h3 id="ganth">Ganthoda</h3>
<br><img src="img/pi_ganth03f.jpg" alt="Dried Indian Long Pepper Root" class=mrg>
[Pipramol, Ganthoda (India); <i>Piper longum</i>]

<p>This root is used as both a medicinal and as a culinary spice in India and 
parts of China. Powdered, it us used to make an herbal tea, mixed with Ginger 
Root and/or Licorice Root and Jaggery or Honey - said to be good for general 
joint health and as a treatment for colds. The taste is earthy, lightly 
peppery, and slightly herbal. The root is very hard, so it must be ground 
for use.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This spice may be available in Indian markets and 
is available on-line as both powder and chunks of dried root. The photo 
specimens were purchased on-line for 2021 US $3.71 per ounce. <p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  This root is ground to powder and added directly to 
Fish, Lamb, and Vegetable dishes in India and parts of China. It is also 
pickled in vinegar for use as a snack, probably fresh as the dried is very 
hard.
