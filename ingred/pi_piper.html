<h1>Order Piperales</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>
The Pepper family (<i>Piperaceae</i>) has about 3600 species in 
two genera, of which genus <i>Piper</i> provides edible spices, herbs 
and roots. The largest number are in the Americas, but those of culinary 
fame are mostly from Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Pepper has been 
an important cooking spice since the depths of prehistory.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>The mostly toxic Lizard Tail family (<i>Saururaceae</i>) 
provides one species that has culinary significance.</span>

<h2 id="ashan">Ashanti Pepper</h2>

<br><img src="img/pi_uziza01e.jpg" alt="Ashanti Pepercorns" width="260" height="191" class=mrg>
<img src="img/pi_uzizal01.jpg" alt="Aziza Leaves Drawing" width="117" height="191" class=mrg>
  [Uziza (Nigeria); West African Pepper, Benin pepper, 
  False Cubeb, Guinea Cubeb; <i>Piper guineense</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to the tropics of West and Central Africa. Compared to 
Cubeb pepper it is less bitter and more herbal. It has a sharpness and flavor 
similar to black pepper, but much less intense, while interesting resinous 
flavors are more pronounced. The peppercorns are smaller than Cubeb, smooth 
and oval instead of round and rough. Production is not high so not much is 
shipped out of West Africa and it's relatively expensive even there.</p>
<p>Ashanti Pepper is sometimes used in the Berbere spice mix of Ethiopia, but 
due to its expense, <a href="pi_longez.html"><b>Ethiopian Long Pepper</b></a> 
is more often used. This pepper was well known in Europe during Medieval 
times but its use declined after the 14th century.</p>
<p>Uziza Leaves are used in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria as a 
flavoring in Pepper Soups, Eguzi Soup and Oha/Ora Soup. If they leaves are 
not available, the spice may be used to approximate the flavor.

<h2 id="cubeb">Cubeb Pepper</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pi_cubeb04e.jpg" alt="Cubeb Pepper Seeds" width="260" height="168" class=mrg>
[Tailed pepper; Shital chini, Kabab chini (Hindi); <i>Piper cubeba</i>]
<p>
Unlike many things called "pepper", this one is actually a member of 
the <i>Piper</i> genus along with black pepper. This plant is native 
to Java in Indonesia and most today is still grown there. It was known 
to the ancient Greeks as komakon, a corruption of it's Javanese name, 
kumukus. It was popular in Europe until the king of Portugal banned 
its sale in favor of black pepper (which he apparently had a financial 
interest in) in 1640 and shipments pretty much ended by 1940. It is 
still widely used as a spice in Indonesia. The taste is herbal and 
much like green peppercorns, but it has much less sharpness. It has 
also been widely used as a medicinal, from China to Europe.

<h2>Long Pepper - Ethiopian</h2> 
<br><a href="pi_longez.html">
<img src="img/pi_longe02e.jpg" alt="Seed spikes" width="260" height="158" class=mrg></a>
[African Long Pepper; Timiz (Ethiopia);<i>Piper capense</i>]
<p>
This pepper, related to the round black pepper, produces loose seed spikes 
embedded with many tiny peppercorns, each inside a fruit capsule. The plant 
is native to Sub-Saharan Africa, from Sierra Leone on the Atlantic coast to 
the Ethiopian highlands in East Africa. It is found south as far as Angola, 
Tanzania and South Africa. It is used as a spice mainly in Ethiopia and 
Eritrea, but the whole plant is used medicinally use in other parts of Africa. 
The photo specimens were up to 0.25 inch diameter and 1.9 inches long 
(6.4 x 48 mm). <a href="pi_longez.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h3>Long Pepper - Indian</h3>
<br><a href="pi_longiz.html">
<img src="img/pi_long01h.jpg" alt="Long Pepper Seed Spikes" width="260" height="178" class=mrg></a>
[Long Pepper; <i>Piper longum</i>]
<p>
This pepper, related to the round black pepper, produces seed spikes 
embedded with many poppy seed size peppercorns. These seeds have an 
effect similar to black pepper but a bit sharper and more citrusy. 
This pepper was very important in Europe from Roman times, but by the 
14th century had been largely replaced by black pepper. This pepper is 
still used in India, North Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia. The seed spikes 
are quite hard, and need to be ground for use. The photo specimens were up to 
0.27 inch diameter and 1.7 inches long (6.9 x 43 mm).

<br><a href="pi_longiz.html#ganth">
<img src="img/pi_ganth03e.jpg" alt="Chunks of Long Pepper Root" width="260" height="212" class=mrg></a>
<p>
In India and parts of China, this root is used as both a medicinal and as a 
culinary spice.  The taste is earthy, lightly peppery, and slightly herbal. 
The root is very hard, so it must be ground for use.

[Balinese Long Pepper; Dei-Phle (Bangladesh); Dee'b Plee (Thai); Dei-Phlei 
(Cambodia); Cabe jawa (Indonesia); <i>Piper retrofractum</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to southern China and Southeast Asia, including 
Indonesia and the Philippines. In most regions it is gathered in the wild, 
but some is cultivated in India. It is very much like 
<a href="pi_longiz.html"><b>Indian Long Pepper</b></a> in both taste and 
usage. In India it's used in curries, preserves and pickles. It is stronger 
than Black Pepper, 
but also sweeter. Both fruits and roots are used medicinally, and an extract 
of the roots is effective against mosquito larvae.

[Chui Jhal (Bangladesh); Dee Plee (Thai); <i>Piper chaba</i>]
<p>
This pepper, native to South and Southeast Asia, is used throughout 
the region. In Bangladesh, the stems and roots are peeled, chopped and 
used as a flavoring for meat dishes, particularly mutton, and tastes 
somewhat like horseradish. In Thailand the fruits, which are orange-red 
when ripe and black when dried, are used both fresh and dried, 
pounded to paste or powder and added to various curry pastes, and 
added to fish to cut the fishy flavor. Various parts of the plant are 
used medicinally throughout the region.

[Soldier's herb; <i>Piper aduncum</i>]
<p>
This tree, which grows to 20 feet high, is native to southern Mexico, 
the Caribbean and tropical South America. It is also grown in the 
Pacific Islands, sometimes becoming an irritating invasive. The name 
Matico is used in Peru, but in other South American countries the name 
can refer to entirely unrelated plants. The long fruit spikes are 
used as a substitute for <a href="pi_longiz.html"><b>Long Pepper</b></a> 
and in Peru are used to flavor cocoa. The leaves have medicinal uses, 
particularly for treating wounds.

<img src="img/sp_pepper04e.jpg" alt="Peppercorns, Green, Black, White" width="260" height="130" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Piper nigrum</i>]
<p>
Black Pepper originated on the Malabar (south west) coast of India, but 
major plantations were later established in Indonesia for trade with 
the Dutch. It is now grown also in Brazil and several Southeast Asian 
countries. Pepper has never been popular in Indonesia despite being 
grown there, but has long been used in India and parts of Southeast 
Asia, particularly before chilis were brought from South America. In 
Europe it has been the most important spice since the Roman Empire 
and was extremely expensive until the 18th century due to trade 
monopolies.

<br><img src="img/pi_voats03e.jpg" alt="Dried Voatsiperifery Fruits" class=mrg>
[Madagascar Wild Pepper; <i>Piper borbonense</i>]
<p>
This pepper grows wild in Madagascar, where the fruits are dried and used 
as a spice called voatsiperifery. It is described as having an earthy, 
woody flavor with aromas of citrus and flowers. While not as strong as Black 
Pepper, it is quite sharp and the sharpness is lingering. Once very difficult to 
find, it is now available on the Internet. The photo specimens were about 
0.125 inch diameter (3.2 mm), purchased for 2021 US $3.80 / ounce.

<h2 id="chaph">Wild Betel</h2>
<br><img src="img/pi_sarm02h.jpg" alt="Wild Betel Leaves on Plant" class=mrg>
[Cha phlu (Thai); Kahe (N. Thai); L&aacute; L&ocirc;t (Viet); pokok kadok 
(Malay); Phak i leut, Ak eelerd  (Lao); <i>Piper sarmentosum</i>]
<p>
This pepper plant, native to Southeast Asia is very similar to 
<a href="pi_piper.html#lalot">Lalot</a>, and the same names are often applied in Thai 
and Vietnamese. The leaves have a light, pleasant bitterness that 
compliments other foods. Leaves are used as wrappers for a popular Thai 
snack called <i>Miang kham</i>, which may be served on open leaves, a 
do-it-yourself kit with leaves and each ingredient separate, or as 
pre-wrapped snacks. In northern Thailand it is the main ingredient in 
<i>Kaeng khae</i> curry. In Laos and Malaysia leaves are shredded and 
included in salads.

<h2 id="lalot">Lalot</h2>
<br><img src="img/pi_pprleaf04e.jpg" alt="Lalot Leaves w/flower spike" class=mrg>
[Pepper Leaf; L&aacute; 
L&ocirc;t (Viet); Japloo, Jeeploo (Khmer); Chaphloo (Thai); Phak ee lert, 
Phak nang lert (Lao); <i>Piper lalot</i>]
<p>
The practice of wrapping meat in leaves (dolma) traveled from 
Persia through India to Southeast Asia. They don't have grape leaves 
in Southeast Asia, so the Vietnamese took to using lalot leaves instead, 
wrapped around a beef sausage filling and called Thit b&ograve; l&agrave; 
l&ocirc;t.  This leaf is also used extensively as a medicinal.</p>
<p>Lalot is often confused with the closely related 
<a href="pi_piper.html#chaph">"Wild Betel"</a> (<i>Piper samentosum</i>), which has 
similar culinary uses. Both are slightly bitter and neither is nearly 
as strongly aromatic as the related Betel Leaf.  The photo specimens, 
purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles, were up to 4 x 5-1/4 
inches and sold in 4 ounce bundles at 2012 US $14.99 / pound. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="betel">Betel Leaf</h2>
<br><img src="img/pi_betel01e.jpg" alt="Green Betel Leaves" class=mrg>
[Paan; <i>Piper betle</i>]
<p>
Cultivated all through India and Southeast Asia, this leaf is best known 
as the wrapper for a slightly narcotic chew called Paan.  It is not the 
highly aromatic (and fairly bitter) leaf that has the narcotic effect 
and negative health impact (oral cancer, etc.), but the areca palm nut 
and tobacco around which it is wrapped.  The photo specimens, purchased 
from an Asian market in Los Angeles, were 6-1/4 x 8 inches, 2012 US 
$23.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pepper Wood / Chili Wood</h2>
<br><img src="img/pi_chiliw01h.jpg" alt="Sticks of Pepper Wood" class=mrg>
<p>[Mai sakahn (Laos); <i>Piper ribisioides</i> also <i>Piper interruptum</i>]
</p><p>
The thick woody stems of this pepper vine are commonly used in Northern 
Laos and by Laotians in northeastern Thailand as a spice. Large splinters 
(1-1/2 x 1-1/2 inch and 1/4 inch thick) are included in soups and stews 
as a flavoring. It has a peppery flavor with hints of chili with a 
lingering aftertaste, and is somewhat numbing on the tongue. The berries 
are sometimes pressed for an oil that is also used as a spice. The plant 
is used medicinally.</p>
<p>If you can actually get some of this, it should be kept tightly 
wrapped in the freezer, as it will dry out and turn black in a short 
time. &nbsp; Subst:  for a 1-1/2 x 1-1/2 inch 1/4 inch thick splinter, 
use 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns and 5 
<a href="sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b></a>.

[Piper Sanctum; Yerba santa, Hierba santa, Mexican pepperleaf, Acuyo, Tlanepa, 
Anisillo, Root beer plant; <i>Piper auritum</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to Central America, extending into Mexico and 
northern South America. The fresh leaves are used in Mexican cuisine 
for flavoring tamales, soups, eggs and chocolate drinks. It is an 
essential ingredient in the Oxacan "mole verde" sauce. These leaves 
have a very distinct "root beer" like taste. The photo specimens were 
9 inches long and up to 6-3/4 inches wide. They were purchased from a 
large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles at the incredible price of 
2015 US $1.45 for 2 leaves, together weighing 3/8 ounce, or $61.87 
/ pound.

<br><img src="img/pi_kava01k.jpg" alt="Growing Kava Plant" class=mrg>
[Kava-kava; Awa (Hawaii); <i>Piper methysticum</i>]
<p>
Roots of this plant are pounded and made into a tea which has sedative 
and anesthetic properties. It has been traditionally used by natives 
of the entire Pacific Island region, including Hawaii, particularly 
during social gatherings. It is also available in the Western World 
in supplement capsules and pills. These may also include leaves and 
stems, somewhat controversial as islanders use only the root. Overuse 
of Kava, particularly when combined with alcohol consumption is known 
to result in severe liver damage and other health problems.

India); Dokudami (Japan); Lizard tail, Chameleon plant, Heartleaf, Fishwort, 
Bishop's weed; <i>Houttuynia cordata</i> of family <i>Saururaceae</i> 
(lizard tails)]
<p>
This is the only significant edible plant in order <i>Piperales</i> 
that is not in the <i>Piper</i> genus. Fish Mint leaves are used 
particularly in Vietnam, the far northeast of India, and in south 
central China, often raw as a garnish or salad ingredient, but 
sometimes cooked with other vegetables. In northeast India it is used 
raw, but also cooked in fish curry.</p>
<p>In south central China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, western Guangxi) 
the long narrow rhizomes are eaten, usually raw in salads and the like. 
They are said to have a fresh peppery flavor.</p>
<p>Fish mint gets its name from having an unusual flavor which some 
people consider "fishy". This herb tends to wilt badly, but can be 
refreshed by complete immersion in cool water. The photo specimens, 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, had leaves up to 2 inches 
long and nearly 2 inches wide.</p>
<p>Variegated varieties are cultivated as decoratives under the name 
"Chameleon Plant". The plant is used medicinally, particularly in 
China. It can become a difficult to eradicate invasive, and 
is considered as such in parts of the United States and Australia.

<h2>Canadian Snakeroot</h2>
<br><img src="img/pi_acanad01h.jpg" alt="Growing Canadian Snakeroot Plants" class=mrg>
[Canada Wild Ginger, Broad-leaved Asarabacca;  <i>Asarum canadense</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to eastern North America, from the Great Plains 
east to the Atlantic, and from Southern Canada to the Southeast of the 
United States. The long, clumping rhizomes were harvested by Native 
Americans as a flavoring ingredient similar to ginger. 	This use is 
discouraged by the US FDA due to its causing severe kidney damage and 
certain types of cancers. A distilled extract called Canadian Snakeroot 
Oil has been used as a flavoring ingredient.
