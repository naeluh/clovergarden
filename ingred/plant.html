<h1>Plants</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>As any agriculturist will tell you, there are two main 
classes of plants: plants proper, which take a lot of care and feeding, 
to keep them alive, and weeds (plants improper) which thrive without 
any care at all, even under adverse conditions. Here we look at them in 
a bit more detail.</span></p>
<p>Having a common ancestor, Plants have a lot of similarities with 
Animals and Fungus. The major difference is that, thanks to Cyanobacteria, 
plants can use sunlight to split carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. 
The carbon is used to build plant cells, while the oxygen is released 
into the atmosphere.

</ul>

<h2 class=lrg id=eukar>Eukaryotes</h2>

<p>For over 2 billion years, life consisted of Bacteria and Archaea, both 
microscopic in size. A little over 2 billion years ago, an Archaea 
cell got it's DNA tangled up with that of a bacterium. This Chimera, 
composed of two unrelated entities, continued to absorb alien DNA and 
evolve new functions and grow larger and larger.</p> 

<p>An extremely important event, was when these developing cells were 
infected with a (probably) parasitic bacteria. This bacteria, dependant 
on the cell, evolved into very important symbiotes, Mitochondria, that 
still maintain their own separate DNA within the Eukaryote cells.
</p>

<p>A little less than 2 billion years ago, some Eukaryotes were also 
infested with a Cyanobacteria. the only entity that can efficiently use 
sunlight to break Carbon Dioxide into Carbon and Oxygen. These 
Cyanobacteria, like the Mitochondria, evolved into extremely important 
symbiotes called Chloroplasts. This was the divide between the Plant 
lineage and the Animal / Fungus lineage.</p> 

<p>About 1.25 billion years ago, Eukariots of both Plant and Animal 
lineages began to adopt sexual reproduction, which resulted in a great 
acceleration of evolution. This made possible very complex multi-cellular 
entities, such as Trees, Zucchinis, People and Mushrooms.</p>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg id=kinds>Kinds of Plants</h2>

<p>The first entities in the very complex plant lineage were single 
  celled, and there are a vast number of these still alive and thriving. 
  They are not, however, of culinary interest, but the multi-cellular 
  plants are what makes our lives possible.</p>

<p>Here we list the plants that are of culinary interest. The 
table for <i>Archaeplastida</i> is listed in order of evolution. 
Each entry links to a detail page listing edible varieties.</p>
