<p>
<b>Life</b> seemed so simple - not so very long ago. There were two 
"kingdoms", <i>Vegetabilia</i> and <i>Animalia</i>.  But entities were 
found that just didn't seem to fit comfortably, so <i>Vegetabilia</i> 
was divided into <i>Plantae</i> (entities that were definitely plants) 
and <i>Protista</i> (entities that didn't seem to be either plants or 
animals). Then it got complicated, up to 8 kingdoms, and now 
the whole kingdom concept has pretty much collapsed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for culinary purposes, we can simplify things 
quite a bit, by ignoring a bunch of whole "kingdoms" that aren't 
particularly edible. So here we consider only edible branches - but they 
are by far the most important branches anyway.

<h2>In the Beginning was LUCA</h2>
<p><a href="hadeanx.html">
<img src="img/hadean01e.jpg" alt="Hadean Landscape" class=mrg></a>
Just after the Hadean Age when the Earth was only about 750 million years 
old (About 3.7 billion years ago), LUCA (Last Universal Common 
Ancestor) came to be. LUCA was not the first life form on Earth, but is 
the ancestor of all life we can identify, living or extinct. Genetic 
research has placed LUCA in a hot, toxic, metal-laden, gassy environment, 
very like the hot, toxic, metal-laden, gassy environment of deep sea 
vents that still exist today. Similar conditions probably also existed 
on the surface in those formative times.

<b>Hadean and Archean Illustrations</b></a>, and here for 
<a href="hadeanx.html#time"><b>Timelines of the World &amp; 
Life</b></a>.</p>
<p>From LUCA evolved two domains of life, <i>Bacteria</i> and 
<i>Archaea</i>. From Archaea evolved the third, <i>Eukaryota</i>. The 
fierce debate as to whether LUCA was alive, or just "half alive", or 
formed in the deep sea or on the surface, are entertainments for 
specialists and need not concern us here.
</p>

<h2>Domain Bacteria</h2>
<p><a href="bactx.html">
<img src="img/bacteria01c.jpg" alt="Cell Structure of Bacteria" class=mrg></a>
These simple (comparatively) single celled organisms have been with 
us since evolving from LUCA about 3.5 billion years ago. They remain in 
the same basic form, having no cell nucleus or internal membranes. 
Bacteria constitute more of the Earth's biomass than animals and plants 
together. The human body contains 30% more Bacteria cells than Animal 
Eukaryote cells (the "10 times as many" theory has been debunked), and 
is dependent on these Bacteria for digestion and some other functions. 
&nbsp; <a href="bactx.html"><b>Illustration</b></a> (Click for 
larger view, details and licensing).</p>
<p>For culinary purposes, bacteria are also very important, for things 
like making vinegar, wine, cheese and many other products. Bacterial 
fermentation is also important for detoxifying soybeans and similar 
activities.</p>
<p>One type, Cyanobacteria, developed advanced photosynthesis (about 3.4 
billion years ago) - using the sun's energy to break Carbon Dioxide and 
release Oxygen. It's runaway success eventually resulted in catastrophe. 
First came the "Great Rust" (to 2.5 billion years ago), then, with nothing 
left to rust, free Oxygen gathered in the atmosphere and poisoned most 
life on Earth. Thinning of the atmosphere and reduction of greenhouse 
gasses resulted in the longest Ice Age this world has experienced (2.4 
billion years ago for 300 million years). It is this catastrophe that made 
our form of life possible.

<h2>Domain Archaea</h2>
<p><a href="archaeax.html">
<img src="img/archaea02c.jpg" alt="Cell Structure of Archaea" class=mrg></a>
These single celled life forms are about the size and appearance of 
bacteria, and originated at about the same time (3.5 billion years ago). 
They were classified as bacteria until 1977, when advanced genetic 
analysis caused them to be placed in their own domain. Not a lot is yet 
known about Archaea. They were thought to live mostly in extreme 
environments but now they have been found in the ocean, soil and the 
human mouth, gut and skin.</p>
<p>Archaea have not been much studied because they are neither parasites 
nor do they cause diseases. They are, however important to life cycles 
of the planet, and may account for 20% of Earth's biomass. Living 
transition forms have been found deep in sediments off the Arctic coast, 
and later elsewhere, making it clear that Eucaryotes developed from 
Archaea. Archaea are still so little known their culinary value is 
undefined, but they are likely important to digestion.

<h2>Domain Eukaryota</h2>
<p><a href="plantsx.html">
<img src="img/eukarya01h.jpg" alt="Cell Structure of Eukaryote" class=mrg></a>
These are the "higher" life forms, with a much more complex cell 
structure, and tremendously larger size than Bacteria or Archaea - around 
10,000 times the size. They first appeared about 2.2 billion 
years ago. Since living transition forms have been found, it is pretty 
certain Eukaryotes are descended from an Archaea who's DNA got entangled 
with the DNA of a Eubacteria. Further bacterial DNA was added over time.
</p> 
<p>The really big difference is that some (parisitic) bacteria infected 
this proto-eukariyote and took up residence in the very large and 
comfortable cells. These bacteria evolved to be highly beneficial, 
eventually becoming the Mitochondria totally essential to our lives 
today. These entities retained their own separate DNA, so Eukaryote 
cells set up Internal membranes to keep things orderly. 
Most important, these internal membranes encapsulated a cell nucleus, 
the definitive characteristic of Eukaryota. 
&nbsp; Illustration by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal (LadyofHats) contributed 
to the Public Domain.</p>

<p>Eukaryota continued to grow larger and develop complex internal organs. 
They are unique in their ability to organize into large, complex 
multi-cellular entities, such as plants, animals and fungus (beginning 
about 1.5 billion years ago). They also developed sexual reproduction, 
about 1.25 billion years ago. Evolution was extremely slow until the 
invention of sex - then it took off like gangbusters. The Eukariotes 
evolved into several distinct lineages:</p>

<h3><a href="animal.html">Animals</a></h3> and <h3>
<a href="fungus.html">Fungi:</a></h3> &nbsp; (<i>Opisthokonta</i>) 
descended from a common Eukaryote ancestor. They both live by breaking 
down and digesting dead and living plant and animal material.  There are 
no significant exceptions.<p></p>

<h3><a href="plant.html">Green Plants:</a></h3> &nbsp; 
(<i>Archaeplastida</i>) were formed by Eukaryotes already containing 
Mitochondria. These also engulfed a form of Cyanobacteria, which evolved 
into Chloroplasts. These Cyanobacteria enable plants to generate their 
own food from sunlight, carbon dioxide and minerals, and to breath out 
Oxygen. Like Mitochondria, Chloroplasts have their own separate DNA. To 
some extent plants also depend on fungi to break down rock to release the 
minerals they need - and many depend on animals for their reproductive 
strategy.<p></p>

<h3><a href="algae.html#brown">Brown Algae:</a></h3> &nbsp; 
(<i>Heterokonts</i>) are of the plant lineage and similar to Green 
Plants, but they have some important differences. Their genetics seem 
to be from a merger of two different <i>Epistokonths</i>. This line 
provides kelp, and other very important sea vegetables.<p><p>
<br>

<h2>Virus</h2>

<p><a href="virusx.html">
<img src="img/virus01c.jpg" alt="Cell Structure of HIV Virus" class=mrg></a>
[viri, viruses, viron (singular)] &nbsp; These entities are generally 
100th the size of a Bacteria and most cannot be seen with an optical 
microscope. They have many shapes, but their structure is very similar 
to the HIV virus illustrated here. Whether or not they are "life forms" 
is a matter of opinion. They have been described as "organisms on the 
edge of life". Unlike the other cells on this page they lack Ribosomes, 
essential for reproduction.</p>
<p>While tiny and relatively simple, Viri are clearly not precursors 
to LUCA, as they can only reproduce by infecting post-LUCA cells. They 
may have originated from DNA fragments of living cells. Their culinary 
value is negative, as they damage and kill food (and people), so we 
consider them no further here, except in matters of food safety.
