<h1>Eukaryote Cells</h1>

<p><span class=bg><i>Eukaryote</i> cells are Chimeras, formed by the fusion 
of two very different organisms, an <i>Archaea</i> and a <i>Bacteria</i> 
(of the <i>Eubacteria</i> variety). This fusion allowed the development of 
much larger, more complex cells. The Eukaryote DNA consists of Archaea 
DNA, Bacterial DNA, and DNA unique to Eukaryote cells. Eukaryote cells 
are not static, they are very active, and there is a lot going on within 
then continuously. See particularly <a href="plantsx.html#ribo"><b>Ribosome</b></a> 
below. The Golgi Apparatus is also very active, packaging and dispatching 
proteins assembled by the Ribosomes.

<p>This is a generalized view of an animal <i>Eukaryote</i> cell. 
Vacuoles (storage compartments) are not shown and do not exist in most 
animal cells, but do exist in some.  Fungus cells, which are very similar 
to and closely related to animal cells, always contain vacuoles, but much 
smaller than those in plant cells. All Eukaryote cells contain 
<a href="plantsx.html#mito"><b>Mitocondria</b></a>, which evolved from bacteria that 
took up residence in the cells.</p>

<h2 class=lrg id="plant">Plant Eukaryote Cell</h2>
<br><img src="img/plantcell01b.jpg" alt="Plant Eukaryote Cell Structure" class=mrg>
<p>Plant Cells are very similar to Animal Cells, including containing 
Mitochondria, but also include <a href="plantsx.html#chlor"><b>Chloroplasts</b></a>, 
evolved from Cyanobacteria. These carry out photosyntheses, using 
sunlight to break Carbon Dioxide into Carbon and Oxygen. They also 
contain large Vacuoles (storage compartments) whereas fungus cells, 
and such animal cells as have vacuoles, have much smaller ones.</p>

<h2 id="mito" class=lrg>Mitochondria Cell</h2>
<p><img src="img/mitocond01b.jpg" alt="Mitochondria Cell Structure" class=mrg>
<p>Mitochondria Cells evolved from a Bacteria engulfed by, but not 
digested by, Archaea cells during early stages of their evolution 
into Eukaryote cells. All Eukaryote cells contain Mitochondria except 
Red Blood Cells. How many depends on the energy needs of the cell type, 
with human heart cells containing around 5000, liver cells containing 
around 2000 and muscle cells containing around 500 (they are very small 
compared to the Eukaryote cells within which they live).</p>
<p>Mitochondria are extremely important because they convert nutrients 
brought by the bloodstream to ATP, the source of energy within the cell. 
They also have other very important functions, including the timing of 
cell death.

<h2 class=lrg id="chlor">Plant Chloroplast Cell</h2>
<br><img src="img/pl_chlor01b.jpg" alt="Plant Chloroplast Cell Structure" class=mrg>
<p>The plant chloroplasts are the components within a plant cell that 
performs photosynthesis, using sunlight to break up carbon dioxide into 
carbon and oxygen. It was originally a cyanobacterium that became 
embedded in a plant cell, and it still maintains its own separate DNA. 
It has, however, become much larger and evolved to maximize its benefit 
to the host cell (more Thylacoid membranes).</p>
<p>The illustration is schematic of higher plant chloroplasts, but 
chloroplasts vary greatly in size and shape. Not shown in this drawing 
are starch granuals, which are usually present within the cell.

<h2 id="ribo" class=lrg>Ribosomes</h2>
<p><img src="img/ribo01b.jpg" alt="Ribosome Structure" class=mrg>
<p>Illustration by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal (LadyofHats), contributed to 
the Public Domain. Ribosomes are the tiny dots in the illustrations above. 
They exist in all living cells, and are essential as the engines of 
protein production. They must have existed in simpler form as self 
replicating chemical complexes long before living cells formed, but all 
the details haven't been worked out yet.</p>
<p>In Eukaryots, DNA strands are read by RNA Polymerase enzymes in the 
nucleus and the information is transcribed into encoded ribbons of 
messenger RNA released into the cell cytoplasm. Bacteria and Archaea do 
not have a nucleus, so the DNA strands are read and transcribed into 
mRNA by RNA Polymerase enzymes floating in their cytoplasm.</p>

<p>When a Ribosome <i>code reader</i> (small subunit) picks up an 
mRNA ribbon, it attaches to an <i>assembler</i> (large subunit). It 
then reads the ribbon sequentially from the cap or "start code" for 
instructions on how to assemble the appropriate protein. The protein 
is assembled from amino acids brought to the Ribosome by tRNA modules 
(transport RNA). When the Ribosome reads the stop code in the mRNA 
ribbon it releases the protein and the two subunits separate. Of 
course, in living cells the whole process looks a lot messier than 
in this illustration.</p>

<p> Viruses have no Ribosomes, so they must parasite 
living cells and subvert their DNA for the protein production needed 
during reproduction.</p>
