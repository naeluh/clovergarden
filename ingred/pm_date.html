<big>Date palms (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>) have been of very high economic, 
culinary and survival value since prehistoric times. Cultivation has been so 
long established the point of origin is not known, but probably was around 
the Persian Gulf.</big>
<p></p>
<big>Today date palms are grown in hot dry regions for the length of North 
Africa through the Middle East, Iran and Pakistan, and some are grown in 
Spain and China. California produces nearly all the dates grown in the US 
(some are also grown in Arizona), but the state's 24,000 tons is minute 
compared to the millions of tons grown in the Arab world and Persia. 
Iraq is the largest producer, more than 7 million metric tons.</big>

<p>In nature date palms are wind pollinated but in production they have been 
hand pollinated since ancient times. This produces a much heavier yield and 
makes one male tree sufficient to pollinate 100 fruit bearing female trees.
</p>

<p>California follows the Arab naming system for stages of ripeness: 
<b>Kimri</b> (green unripe), <b>khalal</b> (yellow full-size and crunchy), 
<b>rutab</b> (ripe, darkened, very soft), <b>tamr</b> (fully ripe and 
sun-dried).</p>


<a name="var"><big><b><big>Varieties</big></b></big></a>

<p>There are hundreds of date varieties but only a few are in major commercial 
production, and even fewer are found in markets in the United States.

<p><big><b>Abbada - Black Date</b></big> 
<br><img src="img/pm_dtblk01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
Soft, creamy and very sweet, with an almost spice-like flavor. The photo 
specimens were 1.3 x 0.7 inches and  0.25 ounces. each.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><big><b>Barhi</b></big> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Berhi, Kharak Berhi, Barhee, Honeyball<i></i>]
<br><img src="img/pm_dtyel02e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
</p><p>
An almost spherical variety grown in Iran and Iraq, particularly popular 
there in the soft ripe (rotab) state. Grown in California as Barhi or Barhee, 
they are the main variety grown here that can be eaten in the khalal (crisp) 
state (most dates have too much tannin at that stage). They are available 
khalal in August and September and are shipped by air freight to Middle 
Eastern communities throughout the US, and by truck to California produce 
markets.</p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles, Middle Eastern folks cart these off by the sack 
full when they're available. When buying them look for strands with some of 
the dates starting to turn to the soft rotab state as these will be the 
sweetest strands. These dates are also sold in the fully cured tamr state 
when they are creamy and extremely sweet, thus the "honeyball" name. The 
photo specimens were about 1.4 x 1.1 inches and weighed up to 0.3 ounces.

<p><big><b>Deglet Noor</b></big> 
<br><img src="img/pm_dtdeg01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
A very firm, elongated, light colored and medium sweet date with translucent 
flesh The photo specimens were 1.5 x 0.75 inches and weighed 0.83 ounces. 
Almost 80% of California production is in this very popular easy to handle 
date.<br clear="left"></p>

<p><big><b>Halawy</b></big> - [Golden Princess]
<br><img src="img/pm_dthalawi01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
Originally from Iraq, this is a very sweet medium size date with a creamy 
texture and golden brown color. &nbsp;

<p><big><b>Hayani</b></big> 
<br><img src="img/pm_dthayani01e.jpg" alt="Dates on stem" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
A dark red to black date very popular in Egypt but not exported from there. 
California produces a modest crop that is sold fresh as they are quite tricky 
to cure.

<p><big><b>Khadrawi</b></big> 
<br><img src="img/pm_dtkhadr01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
Originally from Iraq, this is a medium sweet, mahogany colored date with very 
soft "pudding-like" flesh. &nbsp;

<p><big><b>Medjool</b></big> 
<br><img src="img/pm_dtmedj01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
A large very sweet medium soft date that fetches a premium price. Originally 
they were grown only in Morocco and only for royalty, but in 1927 disease 
threatened to wipe out the trees, so 11 offshoots were sent to California 
as a hedge against extinction. We're kinda short on royalty around here so 
our growers will sell them to anyone with cash. The photo specimens were 
2.0 x 1.2 inches and weighed 0.96 ounces each, though there are super-premium 
varieties that are considerably larger.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><big><b>Mozafati</b></big> - [Bam Date]
<br><img src="img/pm_dtmozaf01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
This variety is grown largely in Iran, particularly around the city of Bam 
in Keman province, thus the moniker "Bam Date". The photo specimens were not 
marked for point of origin but the plastic package was made in Iran, 
suggesting our government's ill conceived trade embargoes are as dysfunctional 
as ever.</p>
<p>Soft and very sweet but not sticky on the outside, this variety is noted 
for being edible in both soft ripe (rotab) and dried (tamr) forms, and having 
an unusually long shelf life in either form.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><big><b>Thoory</b></big>
<br><img src="img/pm_dtthoory01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
Originally from Algeria, this date has very firm, chewy flesh when cured and 
a nutty flavor. <small>Photo from <a href="http://www.hadleyfruitorchards.com/">Hadley Fruit 
Orchards</a></small>
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><big><b>Zahidi</b></big> - [Zahdi]
<br><img src="img/pm_dtzhidi01e.jpg" alt="Dates" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
Light golden-brown, semi-dry and very sugary. These dates are harvested and 
cured in three stages, soft, medium hard and hard. They are widely used as a 
culinary date.
