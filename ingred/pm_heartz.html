<h1>Hearts of Palm</h1>
<br><img src="img/pm_heart04g.jpg" alt="Segments of Palm Hearts" class=mrg>
[Palmito (Spanish); Coeurs de Palmier (French); Palm Cabbage; mainly 
  <i>Guilielma gasipae</i> but also <i>Euterpe edulis</i>]
<p>
These are the leaf buds of palm trees. They may be a couple of feet 
long and are generally cut into lengths that fit in a can or jar. 
Harvesting the heart kills the whole palm stem, so commercial production 
is from clumping palms, either <a href="pm_palm.html#acai">A&ccedil;ai</a> 
(<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>) or far more widely 
<a href="pm_palm.html#peach">Peach Palms</a> which take a lot less water 
to grow. These palms just sprout new stems from the base. The photo 
specimens ranged from 0.7 inches to 1.3 inches diameter and 3-5/8 inches 
long (from a 14 ounce can, they'd be cut slightly longer for a 28 ounce 
can).</p>

<p>Hearts of palm are firm and a little fibrous on the outside, tapering 
to soft in the center layers. The large piece in the photo above has 
two layers pushed out to show the structure. Flavor is mild and pleasant, 
but wouldn't be that big a deal without the appearance and texture.</p>

<p>While France is still the largest importer, hearts of palm are becoming 
popular in the US for salads and appetizers. Most imported into the US are 
from Peach Palms grown in Costa Rica. and Ecuador. At one time most palm 
hearts sold in North America were from the cabbage palm, which has a 
cabbage shaped heart, but harvesting these kills the tree. The expense 
of replacing the trees resulted in the name "millionaire's salad" for 
this form.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found canned, usually in 14 and 
28 ounce cans, in ethnic markets or in the "exotics" section of other 
markets. They are also packed in glass jars for the gourmet market, at 
a higher price, of course. Even in cans they aren't cheap. In early 
2013 I paid US $2.69 for a 14 oz can and $5.39 for a 28 oz can at a 
low cost market.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; There's really nothing to do except open the can 
or jar and cut the contents to the length you want. Generally they are 
not cut much shorter than 1 inch because the layers are likely to fall 
apart in shorter lengths.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 28 ounce can yields about 17 ounces. A 14 
ounce can yields about 7-3/4 ounces. A palm tree yields very little, 
so these have to be grown in regions with very low cost land, labor 
and water.<p></p>
