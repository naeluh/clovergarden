  [Banga (Nigeria (fruits)); <i>Elaeis oleifera</i> (Central and South 
  America), <i>Elaeis guineensis</i> (West Africa), also American oil 
  palm, <i>Attalea maripa</i> (not much used)]
</p><p>
These tropical feather palms, which can grow to over 60 feet tall, 
are very productive and produce oily red fruit about the size of a plum. 
There is evidence palm oil was used in Ancient Egypt. The African species 
was taken to Malaysia and Indonesia which are now the two largest 
producers, but they produce refined oil, not red oil.</p>
<p>Red Palm Oil is much used in cuisines of Central and South America, 
particularly Brazil, in Southeast Asia, and of course Africa. Southern 
India uses a lot of palm oil but gets theirs from coconut palms. virgin 
Palm Oil for cooking is easily recognizable by it's orange-red color.
</p>
<p>The photo to the left, taken in Ghana, shows palm fruit ripe and two 
weeks from ripe, The fruit is often red and black, rather than just 
red, but is orange-red inside.

<b><big>Red Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</big></b>
</p><p>
This Oil is much used in West Africa, and in Bahia Brazil, which has a 
large population descended from African slaves. In Brazil it is called 
Dend&ecirc; Oil which is the Portuguese name.

<p><b><big>Palm Kernel Oil</big></b>
</p><p>
This oil, pressed from the kernels discarded from culinary preparation, 
is almost colorless. It is used mainly in manufacture of soap and 
cosmetics. It is very high in saturated fats so semi-solid at normal 
room temperatures.

<b><br><big>Oil Palm Fruit</big></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Banga (Nigeria)]
</p><p>
The photo to the left shows the form of Oil Palm Fruit most available in 
North America. Several brands are available from several Internet 
markets. This concentrate (cream, paste, sauce, butter) is ready to use 
in Banga Soup and other preparations. An 800 gm / 28.2 ounce can sells 
for between 2018 US $6 and $7 plus shipping.</p>

<p>The concentrate is also much used in Nigeria by those who can afford 
it because it is far more convenient than whole fruit, as you will see 
below.

Here is the preparation process:
<ol>
<li>Wash the fruits well to move all dirt and debris.</li>
<li>Boil the fruits for 15 to 20 minutes or until they soften.</li>
<li>In a large mortar, pound the fruit well, but not so hard you break 
  the kernels. The skins should break up and the color becomes more 
  or less even. You can remove the kernels as you go.</li>
<li>Pour some hot water over the fruit and mix very thoroughly.</li>
<li>Strain the pulp through a mesh strainer and discard the 
  fiber, skins and other solids.</li> 
</ol>
