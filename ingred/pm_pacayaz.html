<h1>Pacaya Palm</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/pm_pacaya05g.jpg" alt="Pakaya Fresh Inflorescences" class=mrg>
[<i>Chamaedorea tepijilote</i> and similar species]
<p>
This palm is widely sold as a decorative "parlor palm" because it is 
slow growing and tolerates shade. The unopened male inflorescences are 
harvested in Central America and Mexico for sale in local markets as a 
luxury vegetable. They are also put up commercially in jars of brine 
for export out of the region. They can be found in markets serving 
Central American and Mexican communities. Unlike Hearts of Palm, 
harvesting these does not kill the palm (as claimed on the Useful 
Tropical Plants site). Male and female inflorescences are on separate 
plants. The small black fruits are not eaten and are probably toxic.</p>
<p>The flower clusters, which are boiled briefly before eating, have 
been compared to asparagus in taste and texture, however this is just 
plain wrong. They most resemble, in color, appearance, taste, and 
texture, baby corn - in fact the Nahuatl name Tepijilote translates to 
"mountain corn". They can be served alone as a vegetable but often 
appear with scrambled eggs or other dishes where they are lightly 
fried. Some complain they are very bitter, but in my experience the 
brined ones are not much more bitter than baby corn. Fresh and 
unboiled they are more bitter.</p>
<p>The photo specimens of fresh Pacaya "chibs" as cut from the palm tree 
were purchased from a large market in Los Angeles (Burbank) specializing 
in Mexican and Central American foods. The largest was 10-3/8 inches long, 
1-5/8 inch diameter and weighed 7-1/8 ounces. Cost was 2017 US $4.99 / 
pound.

This is the form in which Pacaya is commonly available in North America. 
They're pretty much the same as fresh, but having already been par boiled 
and packed in jars of brine, they will be a little less bitter.</p>

<p>Some people simmer Pacaya in a couple changes of water if they can't 
stand even moderate bitterness, but most Pacaya affectionados appreciate 
the bitterness, as do I.</p>

<p>Finding recipes for these is surprisingly diffciult. I have determined 
several ways in which they are prepared.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Battered and Fried:</h3> &nbsp; (Guatemala, Belize) Par boil the 
  Pacaya for a few minutes and drain well. Make a batter of egg white 
  beaten stiff and add a little corn or wheat flour (1/4 cup to 5 egg 
  whites), salt, pepper and chili powder. Dredge Pacaya in the batter 
  and pan fry in 1/4 inch or so of oil, turning until evenly brown. 
  Serve with tomato sauce poured over.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>My Method:</h3> &nbsp;  (tested recipe real soon (06-19))  This 
  is similar to the above but adapted from my Huauzontle recipe, which 
  was adapted from my Chilis Relleno recipe. Main difference: egg yolks 
  are   included in the stiff batter and Pacays are not turned while 
  frying -   hot oil is ladleed over. Tomato sauce included.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Scrambled Egg Method</h3> &nbsp; (Guatemala - tested recipe soon 
  (06-19)). The Pacaya is diced and mixed with chopped onion and chopped 
  tomato. It is fried in a little oil for a few minutes, then eggs are 
  stirred in. When the eggs are done it is served (preferably with hot 
  sauce on the side).<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Stir Fried:</h3> &nbsp; (Costa Rica) Small Pacayas are stir fried 
  along with other vegetables - said to go particularly well with 
  Chayote. They can also be chopped and fried with other chopped 
  vegetables.<p></p></li> 
<li><h3>Salads:</h3> &nbsp; Pacayas can be used, simmered or raw, cut 
  up and mixed into salads. Fiambre is a mixed salad with up to 60 
  ingredients, including raw or simmered Pacaya. This salad was 
  originally to offer to the dead on All Saints / All Souls day in 
  Guatemala. It is now sometimes also eaten by the living.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Grilled:</h3> &nbsp; The unpeeled "Chibs" are grilled "in the 
  shell", then opened and eaten. This method may be a little more 
  bitter than other methods.</li>
</ul>
