<h1>Palms</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Palms (<i>Arecaceae</i>) are among the most economically important 
families of trees and have been since long before the dawn of history. 
Through the tropics they provide fruit, cooking oil, sweeteners, beverages 
(alcoholic and not), building materials, kitchen tools and fuel. In cooler 
regions they are important decoratives, as in Los Angeles where it's nearly 
impossible to find a place without palms in view.

<p>Essential to the cuisines of, and to the very survival of, peoples 
within their natural range, palm products now touch the cuisines of all 
countries.</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Looking at a palm tree it's hard to imagine that it descends from a 
magnolia, or that it is in any way related to a lily, but both things are 
true. It is this very ability for rapid and extreme evolutionary change 
that enabled the magnolias to dominate the world, as they do today.</p>

<p>Palms are tropical and subtropical trees of great economic and culinary 
importance wherever they grow. In California, the Middle East and 
Southwest Asia the drought tolerant Date Palm is important for its sweet 
fruit. In the moister tropics the Coconut Palm and Toddy Palm provide the 
oil, sugar, fruit, timber, medicinals and roofing thatch the people depend 
on for sustenance and shelter. There is no part of a palm tree that isn't 
useful - and used.</p>

<p>Palms come in three basic appearances:
<ul>
<li>Feather palms have long leaf stems with long pointed leaflets 
  projecting from each side (pinnate).</li>
<li>Fan palms have leaves shaped like a hand held fan with ribs radiating  
  from the stem and webbing between them (palmate).</li>
<li>Fish Tail palms are like feather palms except that the leaflets are 
  wider at the end like a fish tail rather than tapering to a point.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="acai">A&ccedil;ai Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_acai01c.jpg" alt="Acai Palm Trees" class=mrg>
[<i>Euterpe edulis</i>, <i>Euterpe oleracea</i>]<p>
These two species of palm have been harvested in the wild for 
<a href="pm_prod.html#heart">Hearts of Palm</a> with considerable damage 
to the species and the local ecology. They are now grown on plantations 
in Brazil's Amazon Basin but little elsewhere because their demand for 
water is too great. Other regions use the <a href="pm_palm.html#peach">Peach Palm</a> 
instead.</p>
<p><i>E. edulis</i> is a single stem palm so harvesting the heart kills 
the whole tree. Plantations must be completely replanted after harvest.
<br><i>E. oleracea</i> is a clumping palm so it can be harvested without 
killing it. It will sprout new stems and provide additional crops.</p>
<p>A&ccedil;ai fruit has long been an important food for inhabitants of 
the Amazon Basin, though the purple or green fruit is small and the flesh 
thin. A&ccedil;ai juice is often used as beverage and ice cream 
flavorings, and for similar purposes. The juice is highly perishable so 
is generally marketed in frozen or dried form.</p>
<p>Recently, beverages containing a&ccedil;ai juice have been marketed 
through health food emporiums claiming high antioxidant content, 
anti-cancer activity, and miraculous curing of many diseases. The 
antioxidant content of these beverages is generally lower than in red 
wine or grape juice. The anti-cancer claims are still under study, 
and legitimate nutrition researchers seriously doubt them, as well as 
all the other "miracle fruit" claims made by the health food industry.

<h2>Areca Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_betel04e.jpg" alt="Areca Palm Fruit" class=mrg>
[Areca Nut Palm, Betel Nut Palm, <i>Areca catechu</i>]
<p>The fruit kernel of this smooth stemmed feather palm is the source of 
the nut used in betel nut chews. The photo specimens were purchased from 
an Asian market in Los Angeles and are just beginning to ripen. The seed 
kernel is still soft and hasn't yet developed red pigments.</p>
<p>In general, some slices of areca nut are mixed with lime (calcium 
hydroxide) and rolled up in a leaf of the betel vine (<i>Piper betle</i>). 
Various spices and tobacco are often included. This concoction (Paan in 
India) is then chewed for a mildly narcotic (and slightly addictive) 
effect. Use is common in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, on 
into the Pacific Islands, and north to Taiwan.</p>
<p> Chewing betel nut stains the mouth red and relates to an elevated 
incidence of mouth cancer. Its use is most prevalent in India, has 
been declining in Southeast Asia, but increasing somewhat in the Pacific 
Islands. It remains very popular in Taiwan where it is peddled by 
scantily clad "Betel Beauties" from neon lit one room glass paneled shops.

<h2>Awara Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_awarra01e.jpg" alt="Awarra Palm in Fruit" class=mrg>
[Awara, Wara (French Guiana,Guyana); Warra (Suriname); Tucum, 
Tucum&atilde;-do-Par&aacute; (Brazil); Chontilla (Ecuador); 
<i>Astrocaryum vulgare</i>]
<p>
This palm is native to the Amazon Rainforest, from Par&aacute; State 
in northern Brazil extending north into Guiana, Suriname and French 
Guiana. It grows to 49 feet tall and regenerates from multiple stems. 
The red-orange fruit is used similarly to the Oil Palm, including the 
use of fruit pulp in French Guiana as the basis for soup made with 
smoked chicken and smoked fish, similarly to the Banga oil palm soup 
of Nigeria. Both Red Palm oil from the pulp, and clear Palm Kernel Oil 
are made. The hard black seed shell was cut to make wedding rings by 
indigenous people and slaves. The oils are currently used to some 
extent for biodiesel

<h2>Coconut Palm</h2>
<br><a href="coconut.html">
<img src="img/coconut09c.jpg" alt="Coconuts on Palm Tree" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]<p>
This palm is native to the tropical coasts of Southeast Asia but has 
been carried by ocean currents and trade to tropical lands throughout 
the world. It is so important, not just to cuisines worldwide, but to 
the basic survival of many tropical peoples and the economies of their 
lands that I have given it it's own page.

[<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>]
<p>
Date palms have been of very high economic and culinary value since 
prehistoric times. Cultivation has been so long established the point of 
origin is not known but may have been North Africa or Southwest Asia. 
Today date palms are grown in hot dry regions for the length of North 
Africa and on through Iran and Pakistan, and in California which produces 
nearly all of the dates grown in the US. Because of its importance this 
tree has its own

<h2>Doum Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_doum01h.jpg" alt="Live Doum Palm Trees" class=mrg>
[Thebaica, <i>Hyphaene thebaica</i>]
<p>
Native to the Nile valley, this is the sacred palm of Ancient Egypt; its 
fruits buried with the pharaohs by the basket load. Today it is popular 
in Eritrea where the fruits are called Akat. The unripe kernels are 
edible and the dried brown rind is made into a palm molasses, cakes and 
sweets. Sprouted shoots are also eaten as a vegetable and an herb tea is 
also made, said good for diabetes.

<h2>Cell Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_micro02c.jpg" alt="Microwave Palm Tree" class=mrg>
[Microwave Palm]
<p>
This North American feather palm, native to Los Angeles, 
California, grows to maturity very quickly and then seems to just stops 
growing. It is easy to identify from it's smooth brown trunk and unique 
inflorescence. The photo specimen, about 60 feet tall, is in full bloom. 
These palms seem never to produce mature fruit so their means of 
propagation is somewhat of a mystery.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Coyo Palms</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_coyol04h.jpg" alt="Peach Palm Fruit cuta and whole" class=mrg>
[Coyoles (fruit); Macaw palm; <i>Acrocomia aculeata</i> alt 
<i>Acrocomia mexicana</i> also Acronomia mexicana]
<p>
So widespread through the tropics of South and Central America, 
the Caribbean Islands, and north into southern Mexico, it is thought 
this feather palm had some human help. It was a very important food 
for the Maya, especially through the later Classical period. Stones 
have been found with sockets to hold the fruit in place as it was 
cracked open with a rock. Today it is purveyed by street vendors 
after simmering in a mix of Panela (unrefined sugar), cinnamon and 
cloves (Coyoles en Miel). Often just the outer fibrous coating is 
sucked for the sweet syrup, as humans cannot crack the shell - only 
macaws can break them with their powerful beaks. I use a sharp Chinese 
cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet, but you need a board with 
a big hole in it to hold them in place. They are said to be completely 
edible when very young, but you need access to the trees for that.</p>
<p>These fruits have a very thin skin, with a fibrous outer layer 
(perfect for holding sweet syrup). Under that is an extremely hard shell 
holding a core of material very much like coconut in both texture and 
taste. The spherical fruits are about 1-1/4 inch diameter. The photo 
specimens were purchased from the Central American section of a large 
Hispanic market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $4.49 for a 32 ounce jar. 
Ingred: Palm Caldsage (Acronomia mexicana) Coyoles, Water, Molasses,

(Singapore), <i>Nypa fruticans</i>]
<p>
This Southeast Asian feather palm grows in tidal mangrove swamps where it 
may constitute most of the vegetation. The trunk lies horizontal buried in 
mud and only fronds and flower stalks grow upward out of the mud and 
water (as in the photo). Sap from the inflorescence (flower clusters) can 
be tapped just as in other palms and is made into an alcoholic beverage 
called Tuba.</p>
<p>In the Philippines Tuba is given a secondary fermentation to turn it 
into vinegar called Sukang Paombong. <a href="pm_nipaz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

[<i>Elaeis oleifera</i> (Central and South America), <i>Elaeis 
guineensis</i> (West Africa) also American oil palm, <i>Attalea 
maripa</i> (not much used)]
<p>
These tropical feather palms, which can grow to over 60 feet tall, are 
very productive and bear oily red fruit about the size of a plum. There 
is evidence palm oil was used in Ancient Egypt. The African species was 
taken to Malaysia and Indonesia which are now the two largest producers.
</p>
<p>Palm oil is much used in cuisines of Central and South America, 
particularly Brazil, and Southeast Asia, and of course Africa. Southern 
India uses a lot of palm oil but gets theirs from coconut palms. Virgin 
Palm oil for cooking is easily recognizable by it's orange-red color.
</p>
<p>The fruit provides two types of oil, palm oil from the fruit pulp, 
used mainly for cooking, and palm kernel oil from the kernel, used mainly 
to manufacture soap and cosmetics. Palm oil has been proposed and 
somewhat used as a biofuel, but ecological and economic factors need 
to be considered.

[<i>Chamaedorea tepijilote</i> and similar species]
<p>
This palm is widely sold as a decorative "parlor palm" because it is 
slow growing and tolerates shade. The unopened male inflorescence are 
harvested in Central America and Mexico for sale in local markets as a 
luxury vegetable. They are also put up commercially in jars for export to 
the US where they can be found in markets serving Central American and 
Mexican communities.</p>
<p>The flower clusters, which are boiled briefly before eating, have 
been compared to asparagus in taste and texture, however that is just 
plain wrong - they most resemble, in color, appearance, taste, and 
texture, baby corn. They can be served alone as a vegetable but often 
appear with scrambled eggs or other dishes where they are lightly fried. 
Some complain that they are very bitter, but in my experience they are 
no more bitter than baby corn.

<h2>Palmetto</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_sabalp01c.jpg" alt="Live Palmetto Palm Trees" class=mrg>
[Cabbage Palm, <i>Sabal palmetto</i>]
<p>
This fan palm native to southeast North America was used by American 
Indians as a vegetable and was later known in the US as the source for 
"palm cabbage salad". Unlike the feather palm currently used for hearts 
of palm the heart is cabbage shaped not spear shaped. This palm is little 
used today because harvesting kills the entire tree. The high expense of 
replacing trees is why the heart was previously known as "millionaire's 
salad".

[Pewa (Trinidad and Tobago);  Pejibaye (Costa Rica, Nicaragua); 
Chontaduro (Colombia, Ecuador); (and many more); <i>Bactris gasipaes</i>, 
<i>Guilielma gasipae</i> and other synonyms]
<p>
Native to tropical forests of South and Central America, the fruit of 
this feather palm has long been consumed by native populations raw or 
stewed. Today it is often made into jams and jellies, dried and ground 
into flour or squeezed for oil.</p>
<p>The photo specimen fruits were typically 1.7 inches long and 1.3 inch 
diameter. I found them somewhat dry and crumbly, a little oily, a little 
fibrous, only slightly sweet, and vaguely resinous, but not unpleasant. 
The skin is very thin, and the single seed is small, so edible yield is 
quite good. The specimens, from Colombia, were purchased from the 
Central American section of a large Hispanic market in Los Angeles 
(Burbank) for 2016 US $5.79 for a 28 oz jar. Ingred: Peach Palm Fruit, 
water, sugar, salt, citric acid.</p>
<p>This palm is used for production of <a href="pm_prod.html#heart">
Hearts of Palm</a> because it is not killed by harvesting but rather 
sends up several new shoots. It also has the desirable characteristic 
that the hearts do not discolor when cut. Peach palms need less water 
than <a href="pm_palm.html#acai">A&ccedil;ai Palms</a> so are more widely planted. 
Costa Rica is now the main supplier of hearts of palm to the US, but 
Hawaii produces larger hearts and some production has been started in 
Florida.

<h2>Rattan Palm</h2>

[Raffia Palm, Family <i>Arecaceae</i> Subfamily <i>Calamoideae</i> Tribe 
<i>Calameae</i> - some 600 species]
<p>
Native to Africa, Asia and Australasia, the growth habit of these palms 
is vine-like rather than tree-like, producing long thin fibrous stems that 
may be hundreds of feet long. Some genera are, however, stouter and more 
tree-like than most.</p> 
<p>While most familiar as material for casual furniture, the hearts of 
some species are also harvested as food, available packed in brine in 
jars at markets serving Southeast Asian communities. They look and taste 
much like the more common <a href="pm_palm.html#hearts">Hearts of Palm</a> but are 
much smaller, tend to be more fibrous and may have a faint bitterness.

<h2>Salak Palm</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_salak2e.jpg" alt="Salak Palm Fruit, whole and split" class=mrg>
[Snake Fruit, <i>Salacca zalacca</i>]
<p>
Native to Indonesia and Malaysia this feather palm has 20 foot leaves the 
stems of which have long closely spaced cactus like spikes. It has almost 
no trunk, the leaves radiating upward almost from the ground. The fruit, 
about 1-1/2 inches in diameter, has a scaly skin like that of a snake 
and grows near the ground at the point where the leaf stems radiate from.
</p>
<p>The white flesh has an apple-like consistency and a sweet tart flavor, 
The fruit of <i>salak pondo</i> is dry, almost crumbly with a distinctive 
aroma, and is not popular outside the region of growth. The fruit of 
<i>salak bali</i> is juicier with a flavor likened to a diluted mix of 
pineapple and lemon juice. It is popular with both natives and outsiders 
but is grown only on the island of Bali.

<h2>Saw Palmetto</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_sawpal01c.jpg" alt="Saw Palmetto Trees" class=mrg>
[<i>Serenoa repens</i> alt. <i>Sabal serrulata</i>]
<p>
This small fan palm native to southeastern US sprawls on the ground rather 
than growing erect trunks. The large reddish-black fruits are rich in 
fatty acids and phytosterols. Extracts of the fruits are often used to treat 
urinary tract infections and other issues. It's effectiveness in treating 
enlarged prostate is controversial and still under investigation. Some tests 
have been positive and others not. &nbsp;

<i>Arenga saccharifera</i>; Silver Date Palm, Sugar Date Palm 
<i>Phoenix sylvestris</i>; Coconut Palm, <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and others]
<p>
Naming here is very confused - there are a number of very different 
trees under each or both of these names depending on region and plantation 
or who's talking about it. I've seen a number of articles with a picture 
of one species attached to the scientific name of another.</p>
<p>In all cases the flower sepals are are tapped for a sap very high in 
sugars. The sap gathered will naturally ferment and become alcoholic 
within a few hours of sunrise. This fermented sap, toddy, is  popular 
with the locals as gathered, and is distilled into a liquor for export.
</p>

<p>If the gathering vessel is coated inside with lime juice the sap will not 
ferment. It is then called "sweet toddy" and has a number of uses. It can 
be made into non-alcoholic drinks which are sold worldwide and made into 
sugar cakes which can be found in Indian and Southeast Asian markets. This 
is a light, tasty sugar and more nutritious than cane sugar - definitely 
my favorite sugar.</p>

<p>The immature fruits of some of these palms are also used in various 
ways. They are available in cans and jars in Southeast Asian markets in 
North America. Young shoots are also eaten in the areas where these palms 
grow in abundance. For information on the various types of Toddy Palm,

These fan palms are native to tropical South America. The more important, 
the Carnauba, grows only in northeastern Brazil, while the Caranday has a 
wider range. The wax coats the leaves which must be pounded and shaken to 
release it.</p>
<p>Aside from its well known use in auto polishes and leather goods, 
carnauba wax is used to make candy corn shiny, as a mold release, wax 
coating on fruit, and in many processed foods, confections and candies. It 
is also used as a stabilizer in various munitions and explosives to keep 
them from going boom until you want them to. &nbsp;

<h2 id="oil" class=lrg>Palm Oil <small>&amp;</small> Coconut Oil</h2>

<p>Use of these oils in food was pretty much driven from North America by 
the rabid denunciation of saturated fats by the American Heart Association. 
Coconut and Palm Kernel Oil are almost entirely saturated fats, while 
Palm Oil (from the flesh surrounding the kernel) is 48% saturated fats. 
Surely, if you consume these, you'll die of heart disease in short 
order!</p>

<p>This opinion is <b>completely unsupported by demographic evidence or 
current scientific research</b>. Today, some health researchers consider 
coconut oil the most healthy fat you can consume. Other current research 
finds saturated fats may protect your heart from the ravages of canola 
oil, which the AHA strongly promotes. No matter what, these oils are far 
and away safer than the Trans Fats the AHA urged us to consume instead - 
now known to be the most deadly fats available. For a lot more on 
Coconut oil see our <a href="oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> page, 
amd for general information our 
<a href="oilshealth.html"><b>Oils &amp; Health</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Palm / Palm Kernel oils do have one serious negative - an ecological 
negative. Some producers of palm oil clear native rain forestes to 
establish palm oil plantations. These forests are very important in the 
Earth's overall ecology. Because of the negative publicity surrounding 
palm oil, some food processors using it have joined organizations 
promoting ecologically sound and sustainable palm oil production. This 
membership <u>in</u> <u>no</u> <u>way</u> assures that the palm oil they 
use is so produced. Membership in these organizations is often just a 
smoke screen.</p>
