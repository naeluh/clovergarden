<h1>Palm <small>and</small> Coconut Products</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>
Palm trees are very important throughout the tropical regions of the 
world, so the products described on this page are very important to a
ccurate reproduction of cuisines from tropical regions. Fortunately 
these products are increasingly available in North America, and 
downright common here in Southern Califorina.</p>
<p>Yes, coconuts come from palm trees, but people think of palms and 
coconuts separately, because the types and usages of their associated 
products are actually very different - so see our 
<a href="coconut.html"><b>Coconut</b></a> page for those.

</ul>


<h2 id="palm" class=lrg>Palm Products</h2>

<p>Most of these come from a type of palm called a "Toddy Palm" or 
"Sugar Palm". Confusingly, there are a whole bunch of palm species called 
by these names, and even the coconut palm can qualify. For details see 
our <a href="pm_toddy.html"><b>Toddy Palm</b></a> page.</p>

<h2>Palm Sugar</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_sugar05h.jpg" alt="Cakes of Palm Sugar" class=mrg>
This flavorful unrefined sugar, made from the condensed juice of various 
palm trees, is generally sold in dome shape cakes of various sizes. Some is 
now sold in a convenient syrup form. While sugar from different palms is 
somewhat different, and some darker and some lighter, it is generally 
lighter in flavor than unrefined cane sugar. It also costs more.

<p>Palm sugar is used in the southern portions of India as palm gur or 
palm jaggery. Gur and jaggery alone are not definitive terms - jaggery is 
supposed to be cakes of cane sugar and gur cakes of palm sugar but the 
terms are often misused in both directions. Palm sugar is a preferred sugar 
throughout Southeast Asia.<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="heart">Hearts of Palm</h2>
<br><a href="pm_heartz.html">
<img src="img/pm_heart04e.jpg" alt="Lengths of Hearts of Palm" class=mrg></a>
[Palmito (Spanish); Coeurs de Palmier (French); Palm Cabbage; mainly 
<i>Guilielma gasipae</i> but also <i>Euterpe edulis</i>]
<p>
These are the leaf buds of palm trees. They may be a couple of feet 
long and are generally cut into lengths that fit in a can or jar. 
Harvesting the heart kills the whole palm stem, so commercial production 
is from clumping palms, either <a href="pm_palm.html#acai">
A&ccedil;ai</a> (<i><i>Euterpe edulis</i></i>) or far more widely 
<a href="pm_palm.html#peach">Peach Palms</a> which take a lot less 
water to grow. These palms just sprout new stems from the base. The 
photo specimens ranged from 0.7 inches to 1.3 inches diameter and 3-5/8 
inches long (from a 14 ounce can, they'd be cut longer for a 28 ounce 
can).
&nbsp; <a href="pm_heartz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pacaya Palm</h2>
<br><a href="pm_pacayaz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/pm_pacaya05e.jpg" alt="Whole Pacaya Palm Inflorescences" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Chamaedorea tepijilote</i> and similar species]
<p>
The unopened male inflorescence of Pacaya Palms are harvested in 
Central America and Mexico for sale in local markets as a luxury 
vegetable. They are also put up commercially in jars for export out of 
the region, can be found in markets serving Central American and Mexican 
communities.</p>
<p>The flower clusters, which are usually boiled briefly before eating, 
have been compared to asparagus in taste and texture, however that is 
just plain wrong - they most resemble, in color, appearance, taste, and 
texture, baby corn. They can be served alone as a vegetable but often 
appear with scrambled eggs or other dishes where they are lightly fried. 
Some complain that they are very bitter, but in my experience the brined 
ones are no more bitter than baby corn.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Kaong</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_kaong02h.jpg" alt="Arenga Palm Fruit Gels, Red, White, Green" class=mrg>
[Kaong (Philippine); Buah kolang-kaling, buah tap (Indonesia);   
<i>Arenga pinnata</i>]
<p>
The immature seeds of the Arenga palm are very popular in the Philippines 
and Indonesia. The photo specimens were from the Philippines where they 
are put up in jars in a light syrup, natural or dyed red or green. The 
red ones are preferred for the very popular Philippine fruit salad. The 
photo specimens, purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, 
California, were about 0.83 inch long. Ingred: 
sugar palm fruit, cane sugar, water, artificial banana flavor, citric 
acid, sodium metabisulfite; (FD&amp;C Yellow #5, FD&amp;C Blue #1); 
(FD&amp;C Red #40).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Palmyra Palm Seed</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_todseed01h.jpg" alt="Toddy Palm Fruit Gels" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Borassus</i>, various species (Toddy Palm #1 above)]
<p>
The immature seeds of the palmyra palm are a firm translucent gel, almost 
firm enough to be crunchy, moderately sweet and with a pleasant palm sugar 
flavor. The photo specimens were 2-3/8 inch square by 1 inch thick 
and weighed 2-5/8 ounces each,  The fruits are black, from 4 to 7 inches 
in diameter, and contain 3 seed gels each. The gels are covered with a 
light brown fibrous outer skin, which is peeled off and the gels flattened 
a bit more in the packing process.</p>
<p>Cans of these seed gels packed in light syrup are easily found in 
markets serving Southeast Asian communities, along with other, smaller palm 
seed gels from other types of palm fruit.<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Dried "Sea Coconut"</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_sead02h.jpg" alt="Dried Toddy Palm Fruit" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Borassus</i>, various species (Toddy Palm #1 above)]
<p>
These are dried slices of fairly mature Toddy Palm fruit. While it's 
called "Sea Coconut" by market vendors in Hong Kong and nearby regions, 
it's completely unrelated to the real Sea Coconut (<i>Lodoicea 
maldivica</i>) which is a tightly controlled item (every seed certified 
and serialized) native to the Seychelles. These slices were about 2 
inches diameter and 0.02 inch thick. I'm not at all sure how these are 
used. Purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles for 2017 US 
$2.19 for 3 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Toddy Paste</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_todpaste02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Toddy Palm Paste" class=mrg>
This paste is made by fermenting toddy palm fruit. The substance is sweet 
and tart like tamarind but a bit more tart and very different in flavor. 
In Thailand it is used as a flavoring in traditional cakes and puddings.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Beverages</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_toddydrnk01s.jpg" alt="Bottle of Toddy Palm Drink" class=mrg>
<h3>Toddy Palm Drink</h3> (photo) is non-alcoholic and sold in just 
about any market that serves a Southeast Asian community. Thailand is 
the largest exporter. Ingredients: toddy palm juice (no added sugar 
needed). Sweet, earthy, just a hint of smokiness (non carbonated). I 
like it poured over lots of ice.<p></p>
<h3>Toddy</h3> is a mildly alcoholic palm wine. If the collecting 
container is not coated with lime juice to prevent fermentation the 
collected sap can reach 4% within just a couple hours. It can be left to 
go as much as a day when it will be stronger and more acidic, but beyond 
that time it goes quickly to vinegar. Toddy, being quite perishable, 
is generally consumed locally.<p></p>
<h3>Arrack</h3> is made by distilling toddy to between 33% and 50% 
alcohol. It is described as "somewhere between whiskey and rum" in flavor. 
Caution: just because it says "Arrack" doesn't mean it's made out of palm 
toddy - there are other strong beverages called Arrack but distilled from 
other materials - you have to be specific.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Palm Vinegar</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_vinegar01c.jpg" alt="Glass of Palm Vinegar" class=mrg>
Anything that can be fermented into an alcoholic beverage can then go 
through a secondary fermentation to become vinegar. In the Philippines 
both Coconut Vinegar and Palm Vinegar are made. The Palm vinegar 
is made primarily from the 
<a href="pm_nipaz.html"><b>Nipa Palm</b></a>. The photo specimen is 
actually Coconut Vinegar, but Palm Vinegar looks exactly the same.
<br class=cll><p></p> 

<h2>Palm Oil <small>&amp;</small> Palm Kernel Oil</h2>
<br><img src="img/oi_dende03h.jpg" alt="Dish of Red Dende Oil" class=mrg>
<h3>Palm Oil</h3> is made from the flesh surrounding the palm kernel 
(seed). Palm oil may be virgin, in which case it is bright red from 
carotenes (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene) but the oil can 
be refined to be clear. It is about 48% saturated fats and about 37% 
monounsaturated. Red <b>Dende Oil</b> is much used in Western Africa 
and in Brazil as a cooking oil. It is available on the Internet for 
persons wishing to accurately reproduce cuisines from those regions. 
In Southeast Asia it is used mainly in clear refined form, considered 
by some studies less safe due to oxidation during processing.<p></p>
<h3>Palm Kernel Oil</h3> is very much like 
<a href="oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> (itself a palm kernel 
oil) and is 82% saturated fats and 15% monounsaturated fats. It is used 
in commercial kitchens, processed foods and in industrial production of 
soap and other oil derived products.
<br class=cll><p></p> 

<h2>Palm <small>&amp;</small> Coconut Sprouts</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_cocsprout01k.jpg" alt="Live Sprouting Coconut" class=mrg>
[Panai, Panang Kizhangu (India)]
<p>
In Africa, Southeast Asia and particularly southern India, Palmyra palm 
seeds are often sprouted in sandy soil, then harvested for use as a 
vegetable when they are about two months old and about a foot long - 
quite a lot bigger than bean sprouts. They are often boiled, then served 
as a snack or appetizer. I haven't yet come across anything on the 
flavor, but presume it'll be at least related to that of hearts of palm.
</p>
<p>Coconut sprouts are also eaten when they are about 1-1/2 feet high. 
They have been described to have the texture of a crisp sponge and to 
be delicious. They are eaten in the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.

<br class=cll></p>

<br>

<h2 id="coco" class=lrg>Coconut Products</h2>

<p>For much more on coconuts themselves and how to work with them, see 
our <a href="coconut.html"><b>Coconut</b></a> page.</p>

<h2>Coconut Milk, Cream <small>&amp;</small> Water</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_coco21h.jpg" alt="Cans of Coconut Milk, Cream, Water" class=mrg>
<p></p>
<h3>Coconut Milk</h3> is made by grinding up 
the coconut flesh, soaking it in water and squeezing it dry for the liquid. 
Generally two soakings are used, the first for "thick" coconut milk and 
the second for "thin" coconut milk. For freshest quality make it yourself 
but canned is pretty good and a whole lot easier. Buy only 
<u>unsweetened</u>, the ingredients should not list any kind of sugar. My 
usual brand is Aroy-D which is a very thick good tasting coconut milk, 
though I have had others just as good - and some that were a bit thin, 
especially from non-Thai sources.  See our page 
<a href="pm_cocomz.html"><b>Coconut Milk</b></a> for details on how to 
make fresh coconut milk.<p></p>

<h3>Coconut Cream</h3> floats to the top of coconut milk and 
can be skimmed off. Just as with cream from cow's milk this is the oil 
rising to the top. Most cans of coconut milk will have some cream, which 
usually sticks to the top lid and has to be scraped off. Rich coconut 
cream is also sold in cans, but buy only <u>unsweetened</u>  with no 
sugar in the ingredients. My usual brand is Savoy, though there are other 
fine brands as well.<p></p>

<h3>Coconut Water</h3> from "fresh young coconuts" is also available in 
cans. The tall can in the picture is Parrot brand and like others 
features some chips of the soft pulp floating in it. The brands I've 
sampled are Parrot, Goya, del Valle, and Polynesian Treasure, all from 
Thailand and all sweetened with sugar (coconut sugar, we hope). Parrot 
is a little watered down,  Polynesian and de Valle were fine, but 
Goya was waaaaaay over-sweetened.<p></p>


<h2>Dried Coconut</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pm_cocodryh01h.jpg" alt="Dry Coconut Halves" class=mrg>
This product is produced commercially and sold grated or flaked in bags. 
Several degrees of fineness may be available. Again, buy 
<u>unsweetened</u> for ethnic recipes - dried coconut sold forfuse in 
baking may be heavily sweetened. Kept in a cool dry place dried 
coconut should keep for months but will eventually discolor.

<p>Dry grated coconut can be substituted in recipes calling for fresh 
coconut but it needs to be reconstituted by soaking in water for 20 
minutes or more before use. For very fine grated use 4 T water to 4 T 
coconut and you'll end up with about 1/3 cup of reconstituted coconut 
or 3 oz. For courser grated use 3 T water to 4 T coconut and you'll end 
up with about 1/3 cup but it'll only weigh 2 oz</p>

<p>In Indian markets you may find "grate it yourself" dried half coconuts. 
You might not recognize them at first because they're so small. Coconut 
shrinks a lot as it dries so a dried half coconut may be only 2-1/2 to 3 
inches across. The left half in the photo was 3-1/8 inch diameter and 
weighed 3-1/8 ounces - and was as hard as plastic. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Macapuno</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_macapu02h.jpg" alt="Balls and Strings of Macapuno" class=mrg>
[Macapuno (Philippine); Mutant Gelatinous Coconut]
<p>
The flesh of this coconut sport never hardens but remains 
gelatinous. In the Philippines it is quite popular, especially for 
Filipino Fruit Salad (a desert salad). It is available in both ball 
and string forms (the most popular for fruit salad), as in the photo. 
The balls are about 1 inch diameter. Both are put up with a moderately 
sweet syrup. Ingred: gelatinous mutant coconut (macapuno), cane sugar, 
water, sodium benzoate, sodium metabisulfite.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Nata de Coco</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_nata02h.jpg" alt="Translucent Dice of Nata de Coco" class=mrg>
To make this product, coconut water is subjected to a fermentation 
that causes it to form a moderately stiff gel. The gel is then cut into 
dice about 0.61 inch on a side and put up in a moderately sweet syrup. 
These dice are often used in Filipino Fruit Salad (a desert salad) and 
in other deserts. Ingred: coconut gel, water, cane sugar, artificial 
banana flavor, citric acid, sodium metabisulfite.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Coconut Vinegar</h2>
<br><img src="img/pm_vinegar01c.jpg" alt="Glass of Coconut Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>Anything that can be fermented into an alcoholic beverage can then go 
through a secondary fermentation to become vinegar. In the Philippines 
both Coconut Vinegar and Palm Vinegar are popular. The photo specimen 
is Coconut Vinegar purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles. 
It contains a "cloudifier", because in the Philippines both palm and 
coconut vinegar are expected to be slightly cloudy.
<br class=cll></p> 


<h2>Coconut Oil</h2>
<br><img src="img/coconut05.jpg" alt="Jar of Coconut Oil" class=mrg>
Coconut Oil was formerly used in many American food products, 
along with the similar palm oil. Together they are known as "tropical 
oils". These oils were driven out of the market by the American Heart 
Association's high profile and well financed vilification of saturated 
fats as artery cloggers, with particular emphasis on tropical oils.
<p></p>

<p>The AHA vilification was not based on valid science, was certainly not 
supported by demographics, and has been discredited by other researchers, 
and by people on the Atkins diet who ate plenty of saturated animal fats 
(the very worst according to the AHA) and yet failed to die. The AHA 
is still preaching this gospel to the delight of the seed oil cartels.
</p>

<p>The AHA urged us to replace tropical oils with partially hydrogenated 
seed oils (trans fats) now known to be the most deadly of all artery 
clogging fats.  Coconut Oil (91% saturated fat) is the dominant 
cooking oil in southern India, Malaysia and the Philippines. The people 
of these regions do not show the dire symptoms predicted by the AHA, but 
are instead rather "heart healthy".</p>

<p>Tropical oils are again appearing in the American food market, brought 
in by food processors desperate to replace those deadly trans fats with 
something safe. Coconut oil in particular is considered the most healthy 
of all oils by a growing number of health practitioners. For more detail 
see our <a href="oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> page.</p>
