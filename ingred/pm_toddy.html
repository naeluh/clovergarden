<big>Palms are vigorous, high production trees, and their importance to 
tropical peoples cannot be understated. Some species, called 
Toddy Palms, have been tapped particularly for their sweet sap which is 
made into sugar and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Their 
sweet fruit and young stems are also used. </big>
<p></p>
<big>The method of obtaining this sap is to climb the tree, cut the end of the 
inflorescence (flower cluster) and hang a container from it to catch the sap 
that drips out. If the container is not coated inside with lime juice the 
sap will ferment and become alcoholic within a couple of hours.</big><small>

Quite a few different palm species are called Toddy Palm and/or Sugar Palm. 
The ones listed here are the most extensively tapped for their sweet sap.

   <p><a name="toddy"><big><b>Toddy Palm #1</b></big></a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     [Palmyra Palm, Wine palm, genus <i>Borassus</i>]
   <br><img src="img/pm_toddy01c.jpg" alt="Tree" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
   </p><p>
   This is the "default" toddy palm, presumed if there are no other hints 
   given. Several species of this tall fan palm are native to Africa, 
   Madagascar, New Guinea and Southeast Asia. All produce rather large 
   fruits which are eaten roasted or raw. Jellylike immature seeds are also 
   popular and available in cans worldwide.  The inflorescences are tapped 
   for sap called toddy which can be kept fresh or fermented for beverages, 
   particularly arrack.  It can also be boiled down into palm sugar which is 
   much used in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia as Gula Jawa 
   (Javanese sugar).</p> 

   <p>Particularly in Tamil Nadu, India, young plants are germinated for their 
   underground stems which are boiled and eaten. The germinated shells are 
   opened and the crunchy kernel is also eaten - similar to a water chestnut 
   but sweeter. Even the fibrous outer layer of the fruit is boiled or 
   fire roasted and eaten. &nbsp;

   <p><big><b>Toddy Palm #2</b></big> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; [Fishtail Palm, Sago 
     Palm, <i>Caryota Urens</i> (and similar)]
   <br><img src="img/pm_caryota02h.jpg" alt="Tree" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
   </p><p>
   Native to Sri Lanka, India and Burma, this fishtail palm is relatively 
   short, growing to no more than 40 feet, and short lived. It has a smooth 
   gray bark with widely spaced leaf scar rings from which the inflorescences 
   emerge. This tree is considered an invasive in Florida.</p>
   <p>The fruit is about 1/2 inch in diameter, red when ripe and contains a 
   fair amount of oxalic acid so it isn't really edible. Once fruiting is 
   complete the tree dies. Meanwhile, the sap is tapped to make a palm sugar 
   called palm jaggery (unrefined cane sugar may also be called jaggery).

   This feather palm native to eastern India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the 
   Philippines is tapped to make beverages and to boil down into a palm sugar 
   known as gur in India. In the Philippines it is much used to make palm 
   vinegar. The fruit can be eaten only if properly prepared, the juice and 
   pulp being caustic in their natural form. &nbsp;

   This feather palm native to southern Pakistan and most of India is tapped to 
   make alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. In West Bengal, India, the 
   sap is boiled down to make palm jaggery. &nbsp;

   </p><p>
   The coconut palm is also tapped for its sap to make palm sugar and 
   alcoholic beverages, though its many other uses predominate. The sap is 
   much used to make vinegar in the Philippines.

   This is the only palm adapted to the mangrove environment. it is 
   tapped for its sap in the Philippines and Malaysia to make alcoholic 
   beverages, and in the Philippines to further ferment into vinegar.
