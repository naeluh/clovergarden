<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General &amp; History</h2>

<p><img src="img/ns_inca01.jpg" alt="Winay Waina" class=mrg>
Potatoes originated in southern Peru and were already an important 
cultivated crop in Peru and Chile 10,000 years ago. They are well adapted 
to growing at high altitudes and under harsh conditions. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0013</a>.</small></p>

<p>Brought to Spain from Peru in 1565, potatoes were first grown as 
a curiosity in botanical gardens. They were so obviously relatives of the 
toxic black nightshade most people didn't taken them seriously as a food 
crop. Spanish and French sailors, however, found eating potatoes 
warded off scurvy, a much more serious threat than a little poisoning.</p>

<p>The English claim Sir Walter Raleigh introduced potatoes to Ireland 
through his Irish estate around 1589. It is said they came from Virginia,  
but this story is probably not true. They were probably introduced to 
Ireland from a ship of the Spanish Armada wrecked on the Irish coast.</p>

<p>A story holds, Sir Walter Raleigh later sent some to Queen Elizabeth. 
A royal banquet featuring potatoes was ordered, but the cooks were not 
instructed. They tossed the root tubers and cooked the greens. There was 
great sickness in court that day and potatoes were banned by order of the 
Queen. I have not been able to verify this story, but even if it isn't 
true, it ought to be.</p>

<p>Germans were the first to take potatoes seriously as food, in hopes of 
supplementing failure prone wheat crops. They tried very hard to make 
bread out of them and that didn't work ("potato bread" is almost all 
wheat). Having failed, but with substantial plantings, the Germans tried 
feeding potatoes to their pigs. The pigs ate them with gusto, and the 
Germans figured that many pigs just could not be wrong - so they 
learned to boil, fry and bake potatoes as vegetables.</p>

<p>A Frenchman named Parmentier learned about potatoes in Prussian POW 
camp during the 7 years war. He introduced them to France by agreement 
with king Louis XVI. The French found their dogs wouldn't eat them so 
would have nothing to do with them. Parmentier planted 100 acres of the 
king's land with potatoes, and the king's soldiers kept them under 24 
hour armed guard. One day the soldiers were given the night off and 
potatoes were soon growing all over France.</p>

<p>In Ireland potatoes became particularly important after the English 
conquest of the early to mid 1600s. The English took all the good land, 
all the money, cut the forests to build ships, and shipped most food 
crops directly to England. The Irish, left landless and unemployed, had 
nothing to do except eat potatoes and procreate. This resulted in a huge 
population increase. Then came the potato blight of 1845 to 1849. The 
population was reduced by about half (from around 9 million to a bit 
over 4 million) through starvation, disease and emigration.</p>

<p>Though brought over by Irish immigrants, potatoes were still viewed 
with suspicion in North America until about 1900 when a potato variety 
developed by Luther Burbank became widely grown in Idaho. It was soon 
accepted in most of North America.</p>

<p>Potato developers continue to experiment with new varieties and cross 
breeding with ancient varieties from Peru and Chile (our commercial 
potatoes are mostly of Chilean ancestry). We now have potatoes of many 
kinds, sizes and colors with different flavors and cooking properties 
to chose from.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Culinary Types</h2>

<p>Washington State University (<a href="potato.html#p01">P1</a>) lists 575 varieties 
of potato grown in North America. Thousands more are grown in Peru alone 
and more than 5000 worldwide. Those listed here are typical of the types 
sold in North America. The exact variety can be critically important to 
food processors and fast food chains, but home cooks can just go with the 
general type and be fine.</p>
<p>A note on names - not only do many older varieties go under different 
names in different regions, newer varieties often have names trademarked 
by the developers. Other developers may produce almost identical potatoes 
but must call them by a different (often similar) name.</p>
<p>Of course, the cultivars I have listed here are all North American 
since that's what's available in my local markets. For British varieties 
see the excellent <a href="potato.html#p05">Potato Council</a> Web site. 
Australians have some of each and then some.</p>

<h2>Baking Potatoes:</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potrus06d.jpg" alt="Russet potatoes" class=mrg>
[Russets, Idaho, Russet Burbank, Norgold Russet; Starchy Potatoes; 
Fluffy Potatoes (England)]
<p>These  potatoes have thick, rough (russeted) medium brown skins, low 
sugar and a high starch content with amylose starch predominating. They 
have a dry, mealy flesh and are preferred for baking and mashing. The 
photo specimens were 5.4 inches long and 2.7 inches wide, weighing 
10-5/8 ounces.</p>

<p>These should never be wrapped in foil for baking. They should not be 
used in soups and stews unless they are primarily a thickener because 
they will disintegrate. They are very good for frying - some cooks feel 
they are the only potato worth frying. Baking potatoes have good storage 
properties and can easily keep for weeks in a cool dark place with good 
air circulation.</p>
<p>The common Russet Burbank was developed by Luther Burbank as a blight 
resistant potato for Ireland, since the Irish would apparently rather 
starve than eat any other kind - and russets are the only kind used there 
to this day.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Boiling Potatoes:</h2>
 
<p>These potatoes with smooth thin skins come in a variety of colors but 
all have a firm, almost waxy flesh. They are relatively low in starch with 
amylopectin predominating and have a relatively high sugar content. Actual 
performance for boiling is specific to varieties but they generally stay 
firm.</p>
<p>They are not good for baking and don't work well for mashing either, 
producing a heavy, lumpy mash. They are best where you want potatoes, 
slices or cubes to remain intact through wet cooking, particularly in 
soups and stews. Round white potatoes predominate in the Northeast US 
while only red varieties are found in the Northwest and California.

   <h3 id="rwwt">Round White</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_potrw01h.jpg" alt="Round White Potatoes" class=mrg>
   [Eastern Potato, Maine Potato, Katahdin, Superior, Norwis, Ontario].
   <p>Round whites are the potatoes called "Maine" or "Eastern", 
   but all these terms are highly deceptive. Atlantic, for instance, is 
   a "round white" potato widely grown in Maine, but it is suitable only 
   for potato chips and isn't any better for boiling than a Russet. 
   Fortunately it only occasionally enters the fresh potato market 
   because most are shipped directly to chippers, but when they do it 
   can mean disaster for a dinner recipe. Plenty of russets are grown 
   in Maine.</p>
   <p>Superior is the most grown for the fresh market, followed by Norwis 
   and Ontario, but they'll seldom be marked by variety. Round whites are 
   almost never seen on the West Coast where reds are the dominant boiling 
   potatoes.

   <h3 id="red">Red La Soda</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_potredls04e.jpg" alt="Round Red Potatoes" class=mrg>
     [similar: Red Pontiac, Chieftain]
   <p>Red boiling potatoes are grown in California (mostly Red La Soda, 
   but also Chieftain) and the US Southeast. They're round potatoes with 
   deep red skin and white flesh. Peak season is  winter and storage 
   properties are good. Excellent boiling potatoes with very good flavor. 
   Excellent for Potato Salads. These hold together well for cubing after 
   boiling in the skins, and the thin skin is easily peeled off.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens were, for the largest, 3.75 inches 
   length and across x 2.7 inches thick. The smallest was 1.6 inches long 
   and across, 1.4 inches thick and weighed 1-1/4 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="bliss">Red Bliss</h3>
   <br>[Bliss Triumph]
   <br>This potato is markedly red with a thin, slightly flaky skin and  
   crisp white flesh. They are grown in California primarily as a 
   "New Potato" and are also grown farther north and into Canada. They 
   are much in demand by chefs and gourmets and are called for by 
   upscale food writers (because they are really hard to find). Red Bliss 
   potato chips are featured at Trader Joe's and other vendors to the 
   yuppie class. I haven't seen any fresh ones in Los Angeles, they're 
   probably all shipped to cities like New York and San Francisco where 
   higher prices are more welcome.

<h2>All Purpose Potatoes:</h2> 

<p>These smooth skinned potatoes are general purpose with a balance of 
amylose and amylopectin starches - not ideal for baking or boiling but 
they'll work well enough to get by.  Good for stews where you want the 
potatoes to break down just a little to thicken the stew, but stay mostly 
intact.<br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="wrose">White Rose</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_potwrose03d.jpg" alt="White rose, Long White Potatoes, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [California Long White, American Giant, Wisconsin Pride, Late Pride, 
   Long White]
   <p>Some classify them as a baking potato but I consider them on 
   the baking edge of the range of all-purpose potatoes. White Rose can 
   pass reasonably well for most cooking methods. Some say to wrap them 
   in foil for baking, but I've found it is better to bake them unwrapped 
   like the thick skinned russets. These are my favorites potatoes for 
   soups and stews. They hold together well enough but are soft enough 
   to provide some thickening, especially if you crush a few pieces. 
   The skin is very thin and the flesh is white.</p>
   <p>California supplies 80% of the US crop, and it is the most grown 
   potato in the state, but some are grown in Washington and Oregon. 
   Their peak season is late spring and early summer. Storage life is 
   relatively short and they green easily. The photo specimens were 4.8 
   inches long, 2.7 inches wide, 2 inches thick and weighed 8-1/2 ounces 
   - about average size for large ones.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="dyhg">Dutch Yellow &nbsp; <small>&amp;</small> &nbsp; Honey Gold&reg;</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_pothong02e.jpg" alt="Honey Gold Potatoes, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   These two varieties look much the same, roughly 2-1/2 inches long by 1-3/4 
   inches diameter. They have thin light colored skins and distinctly yellow 
   flesh. They are available in North American markets, usually put up in 
   24 ounce mesh bags. The Honey Gold is distributed only by Tasteful 
   Selections.
   <p>These potatoes are good for soups and stews, staying reasonably firm 
   with long cooking, though not as firm as White Rose. They can also be 
   roasted, even skin-on, or fried.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="keneb">Kennebec</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_potkeneb02e.jpg" alt="Kennebec Potatoes, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   Round, with a thin light tan skin, very shallow eyes and white 
   flesh with good flavor. A substantial crop is grown in California, 
   ranking third after White Rose and Russet Burbank, but I don't see 
   them in markets in Los Angeles. Pretty much the entire crop goes to 
   processors.
   <p>Kennebec are considered good for potato chips, French fries and hash 
   browns as well as for boiling and scalloping. First established around 
   1948, it's a fairly large mid-season potato with good keeping 
   properties.

   <br><img src="img/ns_pomaris01h.jpg" alt="Maris Pipe Potato Plants" class=mrg>
   [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> var Maris Piper]
   <p>This is currently the most cultivated potato in the UK, accounting for 
   16% of planted area in 2014. It has smooth skin with scattered shallow 
   eyes and dryish flesh that cooks up fluffy. It is considered excellent for 
   roasting, chips (French fries), and mashing, but I have seen little mention 
   of it being used in soups or stews. It is not available in North America 
   due to UK export controls. Subst: for most of it's recommended uses, 
   Russets will work fine, with slight difference in flavor.

   <h3 id="yukon">Yukon Gold</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ns_potyuk02e.jpg" alt="Yukon Gold potatoes" class=mrg>
   [similar: Klondike Goldust]
   <p>These were developed in Canada as a cold climate variety, but 
   have become very popular with the chef set. Though nearly all recent 
   recipes call for them, I avoid them. I particularly object to their 
   turning to mush if cooked a little longer than the minimum (I do a lot 
   of stews and soups). I also don't care for their flavor or color. </p>

   <p>Why does every recipe call for them today, even for uses for which 
   they are unsuitable? I believe, like the Canola Oil industry, the 
   Yukon Gold growers have bought off the culinary publishers, and you can't 
   get your book or recipe published unless you call for Yukon Gold Potatoes. 
   I have seen cookbook recipes that use the subtrifuge of calling for a 
   suitable potato and adding "or Yukon Gold" even though unsuitable. 
   Apparently publishers are as easy to buy as politicians and scientists.
   </p>

   <p>The main reason the chef set likes them so much is, if cooked just 
   right, they are fairly firm and not at all crumbly. This makes it 
   possible to cut them into very neat cubes and slices. Cook them a 
   little too long and they become mushy. The Yukon should not be used 
   for baking where it is inferior even to the White Rose, and certainly 
   to the Russet. Because of the Yukon's current popularity, other yellow 
   potatoes are sometimes palmed off as "Yukon Gold". Real Yukons have 
   shallow eyes which tend to be pinkish. Klondike Goldust is a widely 
   available similar potato for which the developer has licensed the 
   Green Giant brand name.</p>

   <p>These Potatoes have yellowish skins and light yellow flesh. The 
   large photo specimen (larger than most you will see), was 4.7 inches 
   long and weighed 1 pound 1-1/2 ounces. The small ones are more typical 
   of what you find in supermarkets, the smallest being 2.3 inches long 
   and weighing 2-3/8 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="krose">Klondike Rose</h3>
   <br>[similar: Red Yukon]
   <br>A unique potato of unusually elongated shape with red skin and 
   yellow flesh. I have yet to see any of these in Southern California. 
   It is reported to have good buttery flavor, and skins that turns 
   brown when baked.<p></p>

<h2 id="purp">Purple and Blue Potatoes</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potablu03d.jpg" alt="Violet potatoes" class=mrg>
Purples are seen most consistently in markets serving Indian 
communities but also appear in supermarkets and at Whole Foods Markets
(often cheaper than in the supers). Most blue and purple skinned 
potatoes are blue or purple all the way through. The photo specimens 
were 4.4 inches long and 2.2 inches wide, weighing 6-1/2 ounces From 
the white ring under the skin I suspect these are variety "All Blue".
<p>These potatoes must be cooked carefully because they get mushy if 
overcooked. Microwaving is said to be the best way to preserve color, 
but I find it survives boiling quite well. They are a good accent as 
mashed potatoes or in potato salads but have a little less flavor 
than red, white or yellow varieties.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="fing">Fingerling Potatoes</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potfing01e.jpg" alt="Fingerling Potatoes" class=mrg>
Small very elongated heirloom potatoes between 2 and 4 inches long. These 
are fully mature potatoes, not early harvest of immature. They can 
generally be found in the supermarkets in bags of mixed colors, but Whole 
Foods sometimes has bags of a single type, usually Russian Banana (a 
yellow potato).
<p>They are a bit expensive because the cost of growing and harvesting is 
much higher than for larger potatoes. They are used mainly in salads and 
other recipes where they will be particularly obvious and are called for 
by some Indian and other ethnic recipes.

Any type potatoes harvested when they are about 1 inch in diameter but 
definitely less than 2 inches. They may be white or red. As with 
fingerling potatoes, they sell at a premium price so are used in high 
profile dishes where they are particularly obvious. I have not seen the 
name "creamer" used in Southern Califonrnia.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="new">New Potatoes</h2>
<br><img src="img/ns_potnew01h.jpg" alt="New potatoes" class=mrg>
[Early Potatoes]
<p>Properly, these are very young potatoes of any type with a high 
moisture content and very thin paper-like skin that's easily flaked off. 
Potatoes of this description are available seasonally in potato growing 
areas.</p>
<p>Due to extra care in harvesting new potatoes are expensive, but are 
much in demand. They are usually used whole in very simple recipes where 
their flavor will not be concealed, usually cooked by roasting or 
steaming. They are quite perishable and should be used within a few days
</p>
<p>The term "new potato" has been somewhat degraded, mainly because so 
many recipes call for them even though they're not readily available. 
Many people don't know that "new potato" means anything except "small", 
but small mature potatoes are not properly called "new".</p>
<p>Some refer to red potatoes generically as "new potatoes" but this is 
in error. Reds are the potatoes most often harvested as "new" in 
California, but they are not generically "new", they must be very young 
just like any other new potato.

These are the essentially the same as "Creamer Potatoes", but not sold 
under that old name, as it wouldn't be much recognized here in California, 
were these were grown. The photo specimens were from 1-1/2 to 2 inches 
long and weighed about 15 to the pound. They were purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2018 US $1.00 / pound 
in 1-1/2 pound mesh bags. These should be boiled skin-on and served 
whole using very simple recipes, so their colors and flavor can be fully 
appreciated.

thawed by day, then trampled under foot and peeled. They are then let freeze

between freezings and black chu&ntilde;o is not. These can be stored for 
decades, and are important to traditional cuisines in Bolivia and Peru.

<p>
Not a potato proper, but a closely related species. Archaeological 
evidence shows these tubers have been used as a food source by native 
tribes in the American Southwest for at least 10,000 years, and probably 
under cultivation for most of that time. They are still so used today, 
by tribes in the Four Corners region and surrounding. They are very 
small, only up to about 1-1/4 inches, and very bitter, so they need 
special treatment to be edible.
&nbsp; <a href="ns_pot4cz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br class=cll></p>

<p></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>The potato's reputation for being fattening is not so much from the 
potatoes themselves (not much more so than apples), but the oils, 
butters and sour cream they are often cooked in or eaten with. Potatoes 
contain no fat or cholesterol.</p>

<p> Potatoes are about 75% water and 19% complex carbohydrates, and are 
sufficiently nutritious a person could maintain good health on a diet 
of just potatoes and milk (for vitamins A and D). A fair amount of the 
vitamin and mineral content is near the surface, but more than half is 
distributed throughout the interior.</p>

<h3>Vitamins and Minerals:</h3> &nbsp; Potatoes are high in vitamin C, to 
the extent Spanish and French sailors consumed potatoes to ward off scurvy 
just as British sailors consumed lime juice and the Germans sauerkraut. 
They are also fairly rich in vitamin B6 and contain significant amounts 
of Thiamine, Niacin, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus and Potassium. Potatoes 
contain more potassium than any other common vegetable, or even bananas. 
Potassium mitigates the effects of sodium in salt.<p></p>

<h3>Protein:</h3> &nbsp; Potatoes are about 2% protein and that protein 
is a very balanced mix of amino acids. The protein is almost all right 
under the skin so to take advantage of this nutrient potatoes should be 
cooked skin-on and eaten whole or with just the papery skin removed after 
cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Dietary Fiber:</h3> &nbsp; Fiber is provided mainly by the skin, but 
the flesh contains an indigestible starch which provides the same benefits. 
This form of starch in a cooked potato is about 7% but if the potato is 
allowed to cool it will increase to about 13%.<p></p>

<h3>Toxicity:</h3> &nbsp; Despite assurances by the Michio Kushi 
Macrobiotics folks that potatoes will send you to an early grave, 
demographics do not support this claim. The foliage and fruit of the 
potato plant do contain significant levels of the powerful neurotoxin 
solanine, and this toxin is not destroyed by normal cooking. The root 
tubers of domestic potatoes contain very little solanine and new 
varieties are tested for this. In any case, most of the solanine is 
within 1.5 mm (1/16 inch) so peeling even quite thinly will remove 
most of it.<p></p>
<p>The amount of toxin in a potato may increase if it is exposed to light 
and turns green, but this is not a reliable indicator. Bitterness is a 
better indicator as Solanine is an alkaloid. Greening can occur without 
significant increase in toxicity and toxicity can be present without 
greening. Diseased potatoes or those showing decay may have elevated 
levels of solanine and should be discarded. Individual tolerance is said 
to vary, but I've eaten plenty of lightly greenish potatoes without ill 
effect, and no cases of potato poisoning have been reported in the United 
States for about 50 years.</p>
<p>There are rumors red potatoes are unaffected by greening and increased 
toxins, but this is unlikely, it's just a lot harder to detect in red 
and purple potatoes. Measurement of solanine is not at all easy, so it's 
unlikely reliable data is available.</p>
<p>Strangely, some sources (FDA) say solanine toxins are water soluble, 
but most analysis sources say it is not. The fact that boiling potatoes 
does not significantly reduce the solanine content suggests it is not 
water soluable. Some say it is soluble in water to which citric acid has 
been added - but I find no reliable confirmation for this. Scientific 
sources say it is soluable in hot alcohol, but not water.<p>

<h3>Acrylamide:</h3> &nbsp; This substance was detected in fried potato 
products in Sweden in 2002. It is not unique to potatoes but occurs in all 
high carbohydrate foods when heated, like toast, for instance. It has been 
in our food since the invention of cooking.
<p>Acrylamide has been shown to cause cancer in some laboratory animals 
when they are fed massive doses of it over a period of time. Whether there 
is any danger to humans in the dosages we're likely to consume is totally 
unknown, to the extent health authorities are unable to provide meaningful 
warnings or set limits. Food industry workers exposed to twice the normal 
amount of Acrylamide showed no increase in cancer rates.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about acrylamide and want to minimize your 
exposure without seriously compromising the range of flavors in your 
food, you should brown your carbohydrate containing foods to a light 
golden color rather than darker. Toast should be toasted to the minimum 
color acceptable and the same for rice, corn and potato products. 
Smoking exposes you to about 3 times the Acrylamide level you are likely 
to get from dietary sources.</p>
