<h1>Lotus</h1>
<br><img src="img/pr_lotus02g.jpg" alt="Lotus Roots" class=mrg>
[<i>Nelumbo nucifera</i>, Sacred Lotus]
<br>[<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>, American Lotus, Yellow Lotus, Water-chinquapin]
<p>
Native to a vast area stretching from Afghanistan to Vietnam, the Asian 
Lotus has been an important source of food throughout it's entire range 
since prehistoric times. It has since been carried to all tropical and 
subtropical regions of the world. Flowers, seeds, leaves and rhizomes (roots) 
are all edible and popular throughout India, East Asia and Southeast Asia.
</p>
<p>The American lotus (<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>) is similarly edible to the Asian 
species and was a significant native food resource into Colonial times. It is 
indigenous to the southeastern U.S., Mexico, Honduras and the West Indies but 
has been dispersed farther by humans.</p>

<p>The Lotus was unknown in Egypt until the Persian invasion. The 
"sacred lotus" of ancient Egypt was instead the blue water lily 
<i>Nymphaea caerulea</i>. Lotus and <a href="mn_magnob.html#wlily">
<b>Water Lily</b></a> are frequently confused but the plants are actually pretty easy 
to tell apart. Water lily leaves have a deep notch from the edge all the way 
in to the stem and they always float on the water surface. Lotus leaves are 
fully circular with stems in the center, no notch, and generally stand proud 
of the water surface (see flower photo below). Flowers of both are similar 
and both are noted for mild psychoactive and anesthetic properties. Water 
lily plants are not so edible and may be toxic.

<h2>Rhizomes</h2>
<p>The most widely eaten part of the lotus plant is the rhizomes (roots) 
which are particularly decorative when sliced. Fresh rhizomes are easily 
available in Southern California Asian markets, but probably not in most 
of North America. Peeled and sliced rhizomes can often be found in the 
frozen foods section of Chinese, Southeast Asian and Korean markets  and 
are perfectly good for many recipes.</p>
<p>The photo at the top shows typical full size rhizomes. A large link 
like the one at the top left will be about 6 inches long, 2-1/2 inches 
in diameter and weight 10 ounces The variety commonly sold here is just 
slightly pink and becomes just a little more pink when cooked. Look for 
roots that are light in color and hard with no soft spots.</p>
 
<p><img src="img/pr_lotusr05e.jpg" alt="Lotus Shoots" class=mrg>
The rootlets shown in the photo to the left are sold in jars packed in 
brine. They are purely decorative having almost no detectable flavor, but 
they stay firm and hold their shape when cooked.
<p>Lotus rhizomes can be eaten raw, but if growing conditions are not 
properly sanitary it can present a risk of parasitic infection, 
particularly Fasciolopsiasis if pigs are raised nearby. Lotus rhizomes 
sold in the U.S, is probably safe but it's still better to cook it. Raw 
it tastes starchy and much like raw potato, just a bit sweeter and 
crisper.</p>
<p>Cooked lotus rhizomes tastes similar to potato, but the texture is very 
different. It becomes tender very slowly and remains quite firm, almost 
crisp even after long cooking. Thin slices can be eaten with just a few 
minutes of boiling, and will soften only slightly simmered for 45 
minutes. Larger chunks are often simmered in soups for up to 2 hours. 
It's almost impossible to overcook lotus. Lotus slices are sometimes deep 
fried like potato chips, They look interesting but I think potato tastes 
better this way.</p>
<p>When preparing, cut away the ends and joints between sections and peel 
with a vegetable peeler. Immediately place in water acidulated with citric 
acid or lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Recipe weights should be 
with the joints and ends cut away but before peeling.

<h2>Seeds</h2>
<br><img src="img/pr_lotus05k.jpg" alt="Lotus Seed Pod" class=mrg> 
<img src="img/pr_lotuss05e.jpg" alt="Lotus Seeds" class=mrg>
Lotus seeds pods are often seen in larger dried flower arrangements. The 
seeds (often called nuts) are edible and can often be found in markets 
serving an East or Southeast Asian community, packed in vacuum bags in 
the produce section. Fresh (right in photo) have a mild flavor suggestive 
of boiled peanut with a hint of black cardamom and other spices when 
cooked. Lotus seeds are also sold dried in two forms, white (left in 
photo) and fully mature split brown (center in photo). Fresh seeds are 
about 3/4 inch long, 1/2 inch diameter and weigh about 13 to the ounce.

<p>Before drying or packing a needle is used to remove the bitter germ from 
the seeds - why the ends always appear to be cracked. This is a labor 
intensive step adding to the cost. The brown ones are too hard for the 
needle so they are always split.</p>
<p>Lotus seeds are often added to soups and congees. In regions where they 
are harvested the seeds are also sold fresh still in young pods to be broken 
out and eaten eat as a snack. They are also sold coated with a crystallized 
syrup as a confection.</p>
<p>Cooking fresh seeds, simmering 15 minutes seems to give a good flavor and 
texture - at 30 minutes they're still pretty much the same. Dried seeds need 
to be soaked overnight before cooking, then simmer for about 20 minutes. In 
my experience the dried white are a touch bitter while the brown are sweeter 
and have a more pleasant flavor.

<h2>Flowers</h2>
<br><img src="img/pr_lotus07e.jpg" alt="Lotus Flower" class=mrg> 
In regions where they are easily available petals from lotus flowers are 
used to garnish dishes. They are reputed to have moderate psychoactive 
properties and are often used in making alcoholic beverages to add that 
"little something extra". They (and other parts of the lotus plant) are 
used in traditional medicines.

<h2>Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/pr_lotusl04d.jpg" alt="Lotus Leaves" class=mrg>
Lotus leaves are used as wrappers similar to how banana leaves are used in 
other regions - except they are more edible and contribute more flavor to 
the food. Bundles of dried lotus leaves are available in the U.S. from 
Asian markets. Dried leaves must be soaked in warm water for about 3/4 hour 
to soften them for use as wrappers. The photo shows a dried leaf folded in 
half, white side out, and a leaf after soaking, unfolded and 
green side up. The soaked leaf was 25 inches across.

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p>Lotus rhizomes are strong in dietary fiber, vitamin C, potassium, 
thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, phosphorus, copper, and manganese. 
Lotus rhizomes should not be eaten raw if the growing conditions are 
not known. If they are not properly sanitary raw rhizomes can present 
a risk of parasitic infection, particularly Fasciolopsiasis if pigs 
are raised nearby.</p>
