<h1>Proteus</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The Order <i>Proteales</i> consists of four families:</p>
<p>Family <i><b>Proteaceae</b></i>, a Southern Hemisphere family, is best 
known for large, dense, showy  flower heads found in upscale flower 
arrangements, and for shrubs with bright red, white or yellow "bottle brush" 
flowers. They are also important nectar producers in  Australia and New 
Zealand (where the most spectacular versions grow) and South America. A 
couple Genera produce edible nuts of commercial importance.</p>
<p>Family <i><b>Nelumbonaceae</b></i>, a Northern Hemisphere family,  
contains only the Genus Nelumbo, with only two species, yet it is of great 
culinary interest - the Lotus family.</p>
<p>Family <i><b>Platanaceae</b></i> contains Northern Hemisphere trees 
called Sycamores in North America and Plane Trees everywhere else. Their 
only culinary value is for wood excellent for cooking fires.</p>
Family <i><b>Sabiaceae</b></i> is of no culinary interest.

<h2 id="protea" class=lrg><i>Proteales</i> Family</h2>

<p>The <i>Proteales</i> are primarily Southern Hemisphere plants found 
in Australia, New Zealand and South America. Some are grown in the 
Northern Hemisphere, usually as introduced species.</p>

<h2>Gevuina avellana</h2>
<br><img src="img/pr_gavellana2h.jpg" alt="Gevuina Leaves &amp; Berries" class=mrg> 
[Chilean hazel, Avellano Chileno (Spanish), <i>Gevuina avellana</i>]
<p>
Native to Chili and Argentina this evergreen tree bears bright red berries 
that turn black when ripe. The seeds are eaten raw or toasted and yield a 
cooking oil high in monounsaturated oils (similar to olive oil) with a high 
concentration of antioxidants, vitamin E and Omega 7. It is also much used 
by the pharmaceutical industry in sunscreens and cosmetics. While it grows 
well in California and the Pacific Northwest, commercial production comes 
mainly from South America, but New Zealand is now ramping up to become a 
significant producer.

<h2>Macadamia</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pr_macadam01h.jpg" alt="Macadamia Nuts on tree" class=mrg>
[Macadamia Nut, Poppel Nut, Bauple Nut, Bopple Nut, Bush Nut, Maroochi 
nut, Kindal kindal (indigenous), Queensland Nut, 
<i>Macadamia tetraphylla</i>, <i>Macadamia integrifolia</i>]
<p>
This tree is native to Australia but best known to Americans from Hawaii 
where large commercial crops were first grown. These nuts are now also 
grown commercially in California, Africa, South America, Israel, 
Costa Rica and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Macadamias remain a high priced nut because they are very difficult to 
shell on a production scale. I shell them by dropping a nut into my big 
Thai granite mortar and hitting it with the heavy pestle. This way the 
shells don't fly everywhere. The oil is prized by the pharmaceutical 
industry due to it's 22% content of Omega-7 palmitoleic acid which makes 
it particularly good for skin care products.

<h2>Geebung</h2>

[<i>Persoonia lanceolata</i> (Lance-leaf Geebung) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Persoonia laurina</i> (Laurel-leaved Geebung)]
<p>
Of the many Geebung shrubs growing in Australia, only these two species 
have been much eaten by the indigenous people. They are both native to 
New South Wales, <i>P. lancelota</i> along the central coast and 
<i>P. Laurina</i> farther inland. The natives of the region prefer the 
fruit if <i>P. lancelota</i>. These fruits ripen to partially red, then 
drop off the shrub to fully ripen to dark red. They are 0.4 inch long 
and 0.3 inch diameter. The fruit is eaten from the ground, not picked 
from the plant. These plants are not cultivated because nearly all 
<i>Persoonia</i> are very difficult to propagate.

<h2>Wild Almond</h2>

[Bitter almond; Ghoeboontjie; Ghoekoffie, Bitteramandel (Afrikaans);  
<i>Brabejum stellatifolium</i>]
<p>
Not a real Almond, this low spreading tree is native to the west coast 
of South Africa. The fruits look much like almonds, but are laced with 
lethal amounts of bitter prussic acid. While sometimes called "bitter 
almond", it is not to be confused with the bitter almond of commerce, 
which is just a high cyanide variety of the regular almond.</p>
<p>Toxicity did not keep these seeds from being eaten. The Hottentots 
soaked and roasted the seed kernels to drive off the toxins, and did the 
same with roots, which are very high in cyanide. The early Dutch 
settlers similarly soaked the seed kernels and roasted them to make a 
coffee substitute.  Porcupines, an important food animal in South Africa, 
feast on these seeds.

<h2 id="lotus" class=lrg>Nelumbonaceae Family</h2>

<p>This is a Northern Hemisphere family, often confused with 
<a href="mn_magnob.html#wlily"><b>Water Lilies</b></a>, but they are 
easy to tell apart. Water lily leaves have a deep notch from the edge all 
the way in to the stem, and they always float on the water surface. Lotus 
leaves are fully circular with stems in the center, no notch, and 
generally stand proud of the water surface (see photo below). 
Interestingly, though very distantly related, their very similar flowers 
are both noted for mild psychoactive and anesthetic properties.</p>

<h2>Lotus</h2>

[<i>Nelumbo nucifera</i>, Sacred Lotus] [<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>, 
 American Lotus, Yellow Lotus, Water-chinquapin]
<p>
Native to a vast area stretching from Afghanistan to Vietnam, the Asian 
Lotus has been an important source of food throughout it's entire range 
since prehistoric times. It has since been carried to all tropical and 
subtropical regions of the world. Flowers, seeds, leaves and rhizomes 
(roots) are all edible and popular throughout India, East Asia and 
Southeast Asia. The Lotus was unknown in Egypt until the Persian 
invasion. The "sacred lotus" of ancient Egypt was instead the blue water 
lily <i>Nymphaea caerulea</i>.
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0138</a>
</small>.</p>
<p>The American lotus (<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>) is similarly edible to the 
Asian species and was a significant native food resource into Colonial 
times. It is indigenous to the southeastern U.S., Mexico, Honduras and 
the West Indies but has been dispersed farther by humans.
