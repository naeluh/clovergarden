<h1>Seed Ferns, Cycads, Ginkgos etc.</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Far back in the mists of time (around 300 million years 
ago) there was an "Age of Ferns", except there wasn't. Those "ferns" 
proved to be seed bearing vines and trees with foliage that looked sort 
of like ferns, but were neither related to nor descended from ferns 
(which don't produce seeds). They are all extinct now, but are probably 
the precursors of all ancient and modern seed bearing plants. 
Relationships are very difficult to establish so far back, so we're just 
lumping some stuff together, just like real scientists do (into 
<i>Pteridospermatophyta</i>), but we'll do it a little more broadly.

<h2 id="ginkgo">Ginkgo</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Ginkgo biloba</i>]
<br><img src="img/od_ginkgo1e.jpg" alt="Ginkgo Nuts/Leaves" class=mrg>
This non-flowering tree, possibly with a seed fern ancestor in common 
with cycads, has been with us for at least 250 million years. It became 
very widespread in the Jurassic, 201 million years ago, but started to 
decline during the Cretaceous. While remarkably enduring, it evolved very 
slowly and was largely displaced by the rapidly evolving offspring of the 
flowering magnolia. Finally, only a remnant population remained in China, 
but it has now been planted worldwide as a popular decorative. Only male 
trees are planted in most places because the fruit contains butanoic acid, 
which smells like very rancid butter. In China, female trees are widely 
cultivated for the seeds, sold here as "White Nut" in Asian markets.
<p>Dietary supplements made from extract of ginkgo leaves are thought by 
some to improve memory but this is controversial. The supplements are 
approved for treatment of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) in Germany. I 
took them for that purpose when I contracted that problem from a certain 
brand of Australian red wine. I'm not sure if they helped or the problem 
went away on its own. What is known is that ginkgo improves circulation 
in small blood vessels, reduces clotting and contains strong antioxidants.
</p>
<p>The seeds are used in a number of Asian dishes and highly esteemed 
there, but should not be eaten by themselves in quantity over a long 
period of time, because they cause poisoning by MPN (4-methoxypyridoxine). 
In the quantities called for by recipes, and with the frequency such 
recipes are likely to be used, they are perfectly safe.

<h2 id="cycad">Cycads</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [order <i>Cycadales</i>]
<br><img src="img/pt_cycad01e.jpg" alt="Growing Cycad Plant" class=mrg>
<p>
Cycads were pioneer land plants, originating about 300 million years ago 
(give or take about 25 million), though most living species evolved 
within the last 12 million years or so. Most species are slow growing 
and can live for more than 1000 years. They are much liked in landscaping 
because they are attractive, require very little water, and will not 
soon outgrow their location. they also work well as potted plants.</p>
<p>Cycads are quite toxic, laced with a strong neurotoxin, but that 
hasn't stopped people from eating them. Eating whole seeds will cause 
extreme vomiting, discomfort and possibly death, or at least wishing you 
were dead. They are prepared by drying or long soaking to reduce the 
toxins, then ground into flour. Cycad meal (Eenthu) is particularly used 
in Kerala, India. It's long storage life makes it a popular food during 
the rainy season. Cycad has been used in Okinawa as a famine food, 
particularly during "cycad hell", caused by Japanese mismanagement in 
the 1920s.</p>
<p>the trunk cores of some species are filled with high quality starch, 
which has been used by natives of Australia and the South Pacific 
islands. The starch is usually washed and fermented some before use, but 
still may eventually result in a neurological condition similar to 
Parkinson's disease. Commercial starch, similar to tapioca starch and 
called "sago" is thoroughly washed and detoxified. "Sago" is also made 
from the core pith starch of certain palms, which are unrelated to 
cycads.

<h2>Gnetophyta</h2>
<p>This is a Division of non-flowering plants is of highly uncertain 
relationship to other plants. Some consider them closer to flowering 
plants than any other non-flowering group, but this is disputed by 
others. <i>Gnetophytes</i> may have originated over 200 million years 
ago, but are well testified in the early Cretaceous, around 140 million 
years ago. They were a diverse and plentiful plant group into the early 
Cenozoic, around 50 million years ago, but were almost wiped out by the 
rapidly diversifying flowering plants. Today there are only three 
rather strange remnant genera, surviving through adaption to very harsh 
environments.</p>

   <h3>Ephedra</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Mormon tea, Brigham tea, joint-pine, 
     jointfir; Ma-huang (China); genus <i>Ephedra</i> (about 71 species)]
   <br><img src="img/pt_ephedf01h.jpg" alt="Growing Plant" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Ephedras are the best known of the Gnetophyta, being widely used  
   medicinal plants through their native range. they are native to the 
   U.S. Southwest, the Mediterranean region, Central Asia (to the Pacific 
   in northern China), and on the west coast of South America. They are  
   adapted to harsh, bright, sandy environments, often along the coast.
   Their growth habit is a dense array of jointed twigs, with tiny leaves 
   at the joints. Small male and female cones are also attached at the 
   joints for production of seeds.</p>
   <p>The only culinary use of this plant is in teas, particularly 
   Mormon tea from the U.S. Southwest, but also in other regions. 
   Mongolian tea combines dried mature seed-cones of <i>Ephedra 
   monosperma</i> with white tea or herbs, taken without milk. In the 
   United States, ephedra products are banned due to a range of serious 
   side effects.

   <h3>Gnetum</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [genus <i>Gnetum</i> 
     (about 41 species)]
   <p>
   Gnetums are native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, and 
   north into southern China. They are also native to much of coastal 
   India, West Central Africa, and northern South America as far north 
   as Panama. Most species are lianas or vines, but two in Asia are 
   trees. The fruits of most are edible, or the seeds are, anyway. The 
   fruit consists of little more than skin over the seed. Leaves are also 
   eaten as a vegetable. Here we will treat the two most widely used as 
   food.</p>
   
   <h3><i>Gnetum gnemon</i>:</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/pt_gnetum01h.jpg" alt="Gnetum Fruit on Plant" class=mrg>
   [Melinjo (Indonesia)]
   <p>
   This small tree produces red fruits containing seeds ranging between 
   3/4 and 1-1/2 inches long (photo to left). Both seeds and leaves are 
   used widely in Indonesian cuisine, the seeds particularly in sour 
   soups (sayur asem) and the leaves in vegetable curries such as kuah 
   pliek. The seeds are also pounded and formed into thin wafers, to be 
   deep fried and served as crackers (emping).

   <h3><i>Gnetum africanum</i>:</h3> &nbsp; 
   <br><img src="img/pt_gnetuma01h.jpg" alt="Gnetum Leaves, Whole and Chopped" class=mrg>
     [African Jointfir, 
     Wild Spinach; Eru, Okok, M'fumbua, Fumbua (Camaroon); KoKo (Angola, 
     Gabon, Central African Republic, Congo); Ukase, Afang, M'fumbwa, 
     Fumbwa (Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo)]
   <p> 
   This wild vine is native to humid zones of West Central Africa, and 
   prefers to grow in the shade under trees, but does not like swampy 
   areas. It produces red fruit about 1/2 inch long consisting of a thin 
   skin over a seed (same appearance as <i>Gnetum gnemon</i>shown above). 
   It is commonly sold in markets as leaves, either whole or chopped. 
   They are gathered in the wild by rural women, traditionally by 
   uprooting the vine. The women are now being encouraged to harvest 
   leaves in a more sustainable way, and to start cultivating it. While 
   the seeds can be cooked and eaten, the leaves are the primary crop 
   in Africa. They are high in protein and other nutrients, and are 
   used in various soups and stews, or eaten raw.

   <h3>Welwitschia</h3>
   <br><img src="img/pt_welwit01e.jpg" alt="Growing Welwitschia Plant" class=mrg>
   [<i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is actually not edible, except by zebras, rhinos, and the 
   like. I've included it here because it's the sole member of the third 
   surviving family of <i>Gnetophyta</i> - and because it is so 
   outrageously weird. It is found only in the West African coastal 
   desert of southern Angola and northern Namibia, a region that gets 
   less than 4 inches of rainfall a year.</p>
   <p>The seeds sprout, unfolding two cotyledon (embryonic leaves). 
   It then sends out two very wide adult leaves at right angles to the 
   cotyledons. These two leaves, and no others, continue to grow for 
   the life of the plant, which may be up to 2000 years. They are 
   generally tattered into ribbons by the wind. Upon these leaves 
   sprouting, the central growing point of the plant dies and is scabbed 
   over, so it never gets much taller. It then produces male or female 
   cones (one sex per plant) on thin stems around the central scab. 
   Unfortunately, most of the seeds it produces never sprout because 
   they are attacked by a fungus. Cultivation is generally from seeds 
   acquired from a botanical garden or the like.
