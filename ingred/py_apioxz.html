<h1>Arracacha</h1>

[Apio (Puerto Rico), Apio Criollo (Venezuela), Zanahoria Blanca (Ecuador), 
Virraca (Peru), Mandioquinha / Batata-baroa (Brazil), 
<i>Arracacia xanthorriza</i>]
<p>
This parsley root, native to the Andes region of South America is a major 
crop in Brazil but popular all over South America and the Caribbean region.
The flesh may be white, yellow or purple. It is put to uses similar to 
potatoes but has a more distinctive flavor and in some cultivars intense 
color. Leaves are used as a flavoring herb and young stems are cooked as 
a vegetable similarly to celery, though the stems are much thinner.<p>

<p>In appearance, the central root looks like a very tangled Celeriac 
root, and carrot-like storage roots are appended to it. These storage 
roots are the parts harvested for commerce and shown in the photo.</p>

<p>Brazil is now the center of Arracacha cultivation, and they are also 
grown at higher elevations in Puerto Rico, where it is popular. 
Arracacha is now grown in Vietnam where the starch is used to make 
noodles.</p>
 
<u>Subst:</u> parsnips combined with some celery should work.

The Puerto Rican type is much different in appearance from the South 
American ones in the top photo. They are sold as the main tap root, 
which is like a very tangled Celeriac. This matches the description of 
Apio a Puerto Rican cookbook in my posession. The blunt bottom of the 
photo specimen is not cut, but is the root base.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have yet to find these in Southern California, 
but I purchased the Puerto Rican type in the photo to the left on-line. 
Cost was 2019 US $8.99 (plus shipping = $14.69) per pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These tubers do not store well. At an ideal 
temperature of 50&deg;F/10&deg;C they can last as much as 28 days - 
less at both higher and lower temperatures. Loosely wrapped in the 
refrigerator they can last 2 to 3 weeks. In their native regions 
they are usually left in the ground until needed.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These tubers can be cooked similarly to 
carrots or potatoes. They are too hard to eat raw.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; This is not easy in most regions. They like 
temperatures around 70&deg;F, grow very slowly at 50&deg;F and don't 
like temperatures over 90&deg;F. The tops are very vulnerable to frost 
and the time from planting to maturity is 10 to 13 months.<p></p>
