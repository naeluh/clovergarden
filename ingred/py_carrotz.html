<h1>Carrots</h1>

<h2>Carrot (domestic)</h2>

[<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>]

<p>Descended from wild carrots (see below) domestic carrots were 
originally  grown for leaves and seeds used as flavorings. As varieties 
with larger non-woody tap roots were developed the carrot became a 
common root vegetable. The orange root carrot so familiar today first 
appeared in the Netherlands during the 17th century.</p>
<p>The Afghan ancestors of our common carrots are commonly purple or 
yellow and often have branched roots. In Imperial Rome carrots were 
generally white or purple. Our market varieties are naturally white 
or orange, but yellow, red, maroon, purple and nearly black varieties 
have been developed, and one that's purple on the outside and orange 
on the inside. Some have been developed with particular medicinal 
properties.</p>

<p>Various shapes, sizes and colors are grow. In Georgia, a wide 
  blocky variety is hollowed out and stuffed.
<ul>
<li>Imperator - the long tapered market carrot commonly sold whole.</li>
<li>Nantes - a blunt cylindrical carrot, sweeter than Imperator but rare.</li>
<li>Danvers - a conical carrot shorter than Imperator and more tolerant 
  of heavy soils is most often pureed into baby food.</li>
<li>Chantenay - a short, blunt but very wide (up to 3 inches) carrot is 
  most commonly diced for use in canned and frozen foods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage:</h3> &nbsp; 
Carrots are best when purchased with their fresh greens still attached, though 
they are rather more expensive that way. Bagged carrots are fine for most 
purposes so long as the roots are not excessively large. Avoid large bags 
of large carrots intended for feeding to horses.<p></p>

<p>Carrots are best stored without washing, loosely wrapped in plastic and 
refrigerated. They'll last a couple of months. Instead I scrub mine before 
bagging and they still last more than a month.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Don't overcook - even large hunks of carrot are 
tender in about 15 minutes. By 45 minutes (as when used to flavor soup 
stock) they are mushy with little flavor.<p></p>

<h2 id="wild">Wild Carrot</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_carrotw01f.jpg" alt="Carrot Flower" class=mrg>
[Queen Anne's Lace, Bishops Lace, Bird's Nest, <i>Daucus carota</i>, 
<i>Daucus pusillus</i> (American)]

<p>Probably originating in Afghanistan. <i>D. carota</i> varieties are 
now native to southwest Asia, Europe and northeast North America. 
<i>D. pusillus</i> is native to the southeast, mountain west and west 
coast of the US and into British Columbia.</p>
<p>Like the domestic carrot the wild carrot produces edible tap roots, but 
they are small and edible only when quite young, turning woody as they 
mature. A teaspoon of the seeds has been known since ancient times to 
be a natural form of birth control, disrupting the egg implantation 
process. Great care must be taken gathering this herb in the wild because 
it is very similar to toxic Water Hemlock (genus <i>Cicuta</i>). Note that 
flower stems of wild carrot are distinctly hairy and those of most toxic 
imitators are not. &nbsp;
