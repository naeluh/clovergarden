<h1>Celery Root</h1>
<br><img src="img/py_celroot07g.jpg" alt="Celery Roots with Leaves" class=mrg>
[Celeriac, Knob celery, Turnip rooted celery, <i>Apium graveolens</i>  
    var <i>rapaceum</i>]
<p>
   Developed in Europe during the Renaissance, this form is particularly 
   popular in France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Once little 
   known in North America, celeriac has lately become more widely 
   available, with California a major producer. The part eaten is not 
   actually a root, but a swollen stem, from which the leaves sprout. 
   These "roots" range in size from 7 ounces to over 2 pounds. The larger 
   of the photo specimens was 6-1/2 inches long, 4-1/4 inches diameter 
   and weighed 2 pounds.</p>

<p>A strongly aromatic vegetable, celery root is useful in soups, stews, 
mashed potatoes, and various cooked and uncooked salads. The leafy tops, 
if included and in good condition, are an excellent flavoring when making 
soup stock, much stronger than regular Pascal celery.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While many produce markets and supermarkets 
here in Southern California stock these, they may be less available in 
regions that do not have large ethnic populations. Look for very firm 
roots with stems and leaves that are still green and unwilted. Buy 
medium size roots with many stems, as very large ones, and especially 
ones with just one thick stem coming out of them, tend to be very 
fibrous and totally unfit for salads.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These will keep for weeks, even a month or more, 
in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. Wrap loosely in plastic and 
make sure there's air circulation so they can breathe.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Celery roots are rather hard and daunting in 
appearance, but they peel easily with a swivel vegetable peeler. In 
the grungier areas it'll take several strokes of the peeler to clean 
them up, and possibly a little work with a sharp pointed knife. An easy 
and safe way to start cutting a large one is to drive a sharp Chinese 
cleaver knife through it lengthwise, with a soft faced mallet. Roots to 
be used raw are often grated on the large hole side of a box grater, or 
they can be cut into shavings with your swivel peeler, or narrow strips 
with a julienning peeler.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These "roots" are often cooked whole and 
unpeeled in boiling water to preserve their flavor. Take care not to 
overcook them, they cook faster than you might think, and are done rather 
suddenly. Check frequently with a sharp skewer - as soon as it doesn't 
encounter a hard center they're done.

<p>When done, they are often cut into narrow juliennes. They are too soft 
to use julienning tools, so just slice them 1/8 inch thick, then skew the 
slices on your cutting board so they overlap and cut crosswise into strips 
- very easy.</p>
