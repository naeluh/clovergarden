<h1>Celery</h1>
<p>Celery is a marsh plant native to the Mediterranean region. Except 
for the Australian Sea Celery, all common celeries are cultivars of a 
single species, <i>A. graveolens</i>. While celery was well known to 
the ancient Egyptians it is not known if they cultivated it, since it 
was a common weed there. Celery was definitely cultivated during the 
Greek and Roman empires. Before Rome, celery was used medicinally, but 
the Romans seem to have started cooking with it, though with caution. 
Development of modern varieties with thick stems or large roots began 
in the 1600s.<p>

<h2>Stem Celery</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_celery13i.jpg" alt="Pascal Celery, Untrimmed" class=mrg>
[<i>Apiam graveolens</i> var. <i>dulce</i>]
<p>
   Celery grown commercially in North America is almost entirely the 
   Pascal cultivar, which produces very large, mild flavored stems that 
   are less fibrous than earlier varieties were. California is far and 
   away the largest producer, but a fair amount is grown in Florida. The 
   photo specimen was 27 inches long and weighed 1-3/4 pounds, but heads 
   over 3 pounds are common.</p> 
   <p>There are other cultivars sometimes grown by home gardeners, 
   including red stemmed varieties, but these are very rarely seen and 
   are considered less desirable.  In Europe a "self blanching" variety 
   is favored that is mostly pale yellow, like the center of North 
   American celery.

<h2>Chinese Celery</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_celc07g.jpg" alt="Chinese Celery Untrimmed Stalks" class=mrg>
  [Kinchay (Philippines); Khan Choy (China); Keun Chai (Thai); 
  <i>Apiam graveolens</i> var <i>secalinum</i>] 
   <p>
   Probably much like celery grown in Europe before 1600, this plant has 
   relatively thin stems, is stronger in flavor, and is more fibrous than 
   Pascal celery. It is now grown in California and available in the many 
   Asian markets here. If your recipe calls for it and you can't get it, 
   buy the leafiest head of regular celery you can find, and use the part 
   above the first joint where the flavor is stronger. The specimens 
   were 30 inches long with stems about 1/2 inch wide 5 inches above 
   the leaf base. Both stems and leaves are used in recipes from China 
   and Southeast Asia.

<h2>Cutting Celery</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_celcut05f.jpg" alt="Cutting Celery, Leafy Stalks" class=mrg>
  [Soup Celery, Celeri &agrave; Couper (French); Celero (Italy); 
  Celinon (Latin); <i>Apiam graveolens</i> var <i>secalinum</i>] 
<p>
This is supposed to be the exact same thing as Chinese Celery, but grown 
in Europe and North America. There seems to be some variation though, 
as the Chinese Celery available in Southern California has a curved 
cross section similar to Stem Celery, and at least the cultivar Afina, 
popular in North America, has round hollow stems.</p>
<p>This is the preferred type of celery to grow in home gardens. It 
grows well with little attention. Pascal celery is an industrial product 
requiring special growing conditions and a lot of water, and other 
stem celeries are also finicky. As in Asia, both the stems and leaves 
are used. Gardeners cut off stalks continuously during the growing 
season, and the plant sends up more. Note that Celery is biennial, 
growing lots of leaves the first year, then going to seed the second.

<h2>Wild Celery</h2>
<br>[Smallage; <i>Apiam graveolens</i> var <i>graveolens</i>]
<br>This ancestor of the domesticated celeries looks pretty much like 
Chinese / Cutting Celery, which is also sometimes called "Smallage". 
It is grown for production of celery seed, putting more of its energy 
into seeds rather than stems and leaves.<p></p>

<h2>Root Celery</h2>
<br><a href="py_celerrz.html">
<img src="img/py_celroot07k.jpg" alt="Celery Roots 07k" class=mrg></a>
This celery is used so different from leaf celery that it has its 
own <a href="py_celerrz.html"><b>Root Celery</b></a> page.

<h2 id="sea">Sea Celery</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_celpro01h.jpg" alt="Sea Celery Plants" class=mrg>
[<i>Apium prostratum</i>]
<p>
This celery, native to Australia and New Zealand, was an important 
vegetable to early Australian colonists. Captain Cook also harvested it 
to ward off scurvy among his sailors. It tastes much like regular celery, 
and dried leaves are used in Australian spice mixes. Var <i>prostratum</i> 
grows on sand dunes, while var <i>filiforme</i>, considered the better 
for cooking, grows in mangrove swamps. Sea Celery is commercially 
cultivated to a limited extent.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Pascal celery is available 
throughout North America in every supermarket and independent market. 
Look for heads heavy for their size with very firm stems. For most 
soups, stews and ethnic recipes you want celery with plenty of leaves. 
Leafy celery can generally be found in farmer's markets. Chinese Celery 
is increasingly available in Asian markets and is always sold with the 
leaves on.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Celery will keep, loosely wrapped in plastic, 
for a couple weeks in the refrigerator, but the outer stalks will 
gradually become soft and start to yellow. Discard any that are like 
that, their flavor will be inferior. Chinese Celery is more perishable 
than Pascal celery, and harder to refrigerate due to it's length. 
Fortunately, it bends easily.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for removing the strings. 
This is a difficult wasteful and generally unnecessary process in most 
cases - maybe you have to do this in Europe, but not here. If you need 
the stalks particularly non-stringy, just run a sharp vegetable peeler 
down the edges of the stalks, where the toughest strings are.

<p>Some recipes in European style ask to use only the yellow-green 
internal stems. Sometimes this is for tenderness in salads and the 
like, but also, Europeans favor a "self blanching" variety that is 
almost all yellow-green. That variety is not seen in North America.
</p>

<p>When using celery to make soup stock cut it from the leafy end above 
the first joint for the best flavor. When reviving Medieval, Renaissance 
or Roman recipes, use Chinese / Cutting Celery, or lacking that use the 
part above the first joint. Do the same for Asian recipes if you can't 
get Chinese Celery. Pascal celery is not used in China or Southeast 
Asia.</p>

<p>What to do with the pale center? I just munch it, leaves and all, as 
an impromptu salad while working, dressed with a flavorful vinegar and 
salt. Of course, you can also add it to more formal salads.
</p> 

<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Celery is often 
an important part of weight loss diets, as it provides bulk and fullness 
from fiber. It is not, however, a "negative calorie" food, as some have 
maintained. The digestible part is easily digested and contributes 
some calories.<p></p>
