[Gourmet's parsley, Garden Chervil, <i>Anthriscus cerefolium</i>]
<p>
This plant, native to the Caucasus, was spread through Europe during the 
Roman Empire and today is used there mostly in France. The leaves have a 
more delicate flavor than parsley and with a hint of liquorice. Today it 
is commonly called for in gourmet magazines recipes to help you feel 
inadequate because you can't get it. To be fair, chervil is a standard 
component of the French <i>fines herbs</i> mix used in more delicately 
flavored dishes. I imagine it can be had at the Santa Monica Farmer's 
Market, but nothing will get me to drive to Santa Monica at dawn on 
Saturday to do battle with desperate chefs from all those fancy West 
Side restaurants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, chervil can often be found put up in 26 oz jars of 
brine at markets serving an Armenian community (see photo below).

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storage</h3>: &nbsp; Chervil is most 
called for in recipes from France and Armenia. Most recipes call for 
fresh chervil which is all but impossible to find in Los Angeles, so 
your chances in Cleveland are probably pretty slim. I have read that 
chervil is now a commercial crop in California, but that must be in 
the Sybaritic North since chervil doesn't like heat or dryness - and 
we're really not so much into French cuisine down here anyway.
<p>Clearly the Armenians are willing to use brine pickled chervil because 
many of the markets serving that community have it in 26 oz jars. I know 
it's being bought because I've seen it sold out more than available. It 
would usually be used in an appetizer plate with herbs and other 
pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>Fresh chervil can be stored similarly to parsley. If a bit wilted cut 
off the stem bottoms and stand in water with a pinch of citric acid in it 
to refresh, wrap lightly and refrigerate. Pickled chervil can be 
refrigerated tightly sealed in a jar with its original brine for a 
couple months.</p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>: &nbsp; For pickled chervil, soak in room temperature 
water for about a half hour to leach out some of the salt and citric 
acid. Fresh, use like any other herb.<p></p>
<h3>Subst</h3>: &nbsp; Use the short inside leafy stems of Celery with 
a little fresh parsley and just a touch of fresh tarragon. Not quite the 
same but it'll serve.

<h2>Chervil Roots</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_chervb01e.jpg" alt="Chervil Roots" class=mrg>
  [Turnip-rooted Chervil, Tuberous-rooted Chervil, Bulbous Chervil, 
  Parsnip Chervil; <i>Chaerophyllum bulbosum</i>]
<p>
This plant is not only a different species from the leaf chervil, it 
is in a different genus, but always called chervil, so this is the page 
for it. It was popular from the time of the Roman Empire into the 19th 
century, Today chervil roots are used in the cuisines of France, mainly 
in soups and stews, and have been forgotten just about everywhere else.
</p>
<p>Unlike the leaf chervil, this plant sends up a long pole-like stem 
with relatively sparse foliage and flower heads at the top. The roots 
are typically around 2-3/4 inches long and 1-1/4 inches wide at the top 
and have a light tan interior color. Properly aged (see Harvesting) they 
are said to taste similar to chestnuts, with a hint of carrot.

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storage</h3>: &nbsp; You probably won't 
be able to buy any in North America. You'll have to grow your own - if 
you can find seeds. If you have roots, they can be kept a couple months 
in the fridge or a cool root cellar.<p></p>

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; Chervil root seeds must be fresh, and need to 
be refrigerated below 40&deg;F/4.4&deg;C for at least 2 months before 
planting. Plant very shallow. They will still have a low germination 
rate. They like loose, moist soil and will grow in part shade or full 
sun.<p></p> 

<h3>Harvesting:</h3> &nbsp; The roots are harvested after the foliage 
dies, usually by August from a planting the previous autumn. After 
harvest, chervil roots are stored in a cool location (root cellar) for 
three months or more to develop their flavor. This can be shortened by 
refrigerating them for several weeks.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking</h3>: &nbsp; These roots are always simmered or roasted 
skin-on for best flavor. They are used in soups and stews, similar to 
how parsley roots and parsnips are used.<p><p>

<h3>Subst</h3>: &nbsp; Use parsley roots (not parsnips) - not the same 
as the unique flavor of chervil roots, but serviceable, or perhaps 
some carrot and chestnuts.<p></p>
