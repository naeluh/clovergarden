<h1>Cilantro / Coriander</h1>

<p>Originating in Western Asia and/or Southern Europe, coriander has 
been cultivated at least since the days of Tutankhamen, and gathered wild 
from deep into prehistory. It was brought to North America by the first 
English and Dutch settlers, and to Latin America and the Canary Islands 
Spanish and Portuguese invaders. It is one of the most important herbs 
and spices through India, Southeast Asia, China and Africa. All parts 
of the plant are edible.</p>

<h2>Cilantro</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Coriander Leaf, 
Fresh Coriander, Chinese Parsley; Dhania sabz (India); Won Soy, Wonsoy 
(Philippine); Xiang cai, Heung choy (China); Ngo, Mui (Viet); 
Pak Chee (Thai); Pak hom pom (Laos);  Coriandolo (Italy); 
<i>Coriandrum sativum</i> (Parsley family)]
<p>
This herb was once in very wide use all over Europe, but has been 
almost completely supplanted by parsley. In Western Europe, only 
traditional recipes in southern Portugal and Spain's Canary Islands 
still call for it. On the other hand, it is greatly used in most 
non-European cuisines worldwide, and in the Caucasus where Cilantro 
and Coriander seed are the chief herb and spice of Georgia.<p>

<p>Many long years ago, when I first starting cooking, I was using the 
<i>1000 Recipe Chinese Cookbook</i> and was totally mystified by all 
the calls for "Chinese Parsley". No such thing was sold in Southern 
California. Now remember, the public Internet was still 30 years away, 
so you couldn't get all your questions answered in 12 seconds back 
then. Today, all the markets have Cilantro, and the ethnic markets have 
heaps and piles of it.</p>   

<p>There is a strong "I hate Cilantro" movement on the Internet, but 
the condition is curable by exposure. A leader of one such Web based 
group, after extensive testing for hate articles, realized to her horror 
that she had come to rather like cilantro and had to resign her post. 
Her's is far from the only such story - even some people who claim to 
have the genetic defect that makes Cilantro taste bad testify that 
exposure cures that problem.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Ethnic markets and farmer's 
markets are the best sources because you can count on it being fresh, 
and cheap, important for many ethnic cuisines. If needed, it can be 
refreshed by cutting off the bottom 1/2 inch or so of the stems 
and standing in a cup with an inch of cool water in it. Remove any 
substandard leaves and bag it loosely in plastic. Stored in the 
refrigerator it will last more than a week but should be replaced weekly 
because it slowly declines in flavor. Dried is completely worthless and 
frozen isn't much better.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Cilantro is most often used raw as a salad 
ingredient, garnish or component of a salsa. When cooked it should be 
added at the very end of cooking as heat quickly degrades the flavor.

<h2>Coriander Seed</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;   [Dahnia (India)]
<p>
These "seeds" are 
actually dried fruits containing seeds. While not now used in Europe to 
anywhere near the extent they were in Medieval times, coriander seeds are 
still used in pickling and sausage making. In India they are used in vast 
quantity for all manner of curries and spice mixtures, almost always with 
Cumin at a ratio of about 1 T Coriander to 1 t cumin. This combination 
was also popular in Imperial Rome, and is used in Africa and the Middle 
East.</p>
<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Clearly the best place to buy is 
in an Indian market where you can buy any quantity you need very cheaply 
and can be sure it's fresh. Otherwise the ethnic section of most 
independent markets. Store tightly sealed in a glass jar in a cool place 
away from light and it'll last about a year. Don't buy it ground which 
turns quickly to sawdust - grind your own as needed. European coriander 
tends to be a bit smaller and darker than that from India. The photo 
specimens, from India, were typically 0.140 inch diameter (3.6 mm).
<p></p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In India and parts of Africa coriander seed is 
dry roasted before grinding and/or incorporated in a recipe. Since it's 
almost always accompanied by Cumin, I roast the cumin first as it's easier 
to tell by smell when the pan is hot enough. The seeds should become aromatic 
and darken only just slightly. Cool before grinding.<p></p>
<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Researchers have recently found 
coriander oil to be a powerful anti-bacterial agent, useful for food 
preservation and safety. It was found effective against almost all 
bacteria tested.

<h2>Cilantro Root</h2> 
<p>
While perfectly edible, cilantro roots seem to be used only in the 
cuisine of Thailand, and to a much lesser extent in a couple of 
Thailand's neighbors. Roots are used as a component of curry pastes and 
in some soups.</p>
<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The only place you're going to get 
cilantro roots is at a farmer's market, and even then you may have to ask 
the grower to bring you some the next week. If you cut the stems off as 
you would for carrots, cilantro root can be stored loosely wrapped in 
plastic refrigerated with the carrots and turnips. They will last for 
about 3 weeks, and can also be frozen, bagged with water to prevent 
freezer burn.<p></p>
<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; In recipes that call for roots, if you can't get 
them, use stems, but no leaves.

<h2>Dhana Dal</h2> 
<p>
This is actually coriander seeds,extracted from the fruit husks, rolled 
and toasted. It's very tasty but is strictly an Indian specialty 
available only in Indian markets. It is a relatively new product, and 
named partly in hope of getting around export taxes on spices by calling 
it "Dal". The courts ruled otherwise.</p>
<p>It is used primarily as a mouth freshener after meals. If it was not 
toasted as purchased it should be lightly toasted, but not enough to 
significantly change its color. It is also used in Sambars and the like 
in Southern India.
