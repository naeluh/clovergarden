This herb is native to Mexico, Central and South America, but is now 
grown worldwide. As a culinary herb it is most important in Southeast 
Asia, the far northeast of India, and the Caribbean. It is sometimes 
described as tasting like Cilantro, but stronger. I find the resemblance 
detectable, but not close. Unlike Cilantro, it takes well to drying, 
holding both color and flavor.</p>
<p>The photo specimens are up to 9-1/4 inches long and 1-1/2 inches 
wide, but it can get up to at least 14 inches long and 2 inches 
wide.</p>

<p>In Vietnam this is a favorite herb for tearing up and adding to 
Pho Beef Noodle Soup. This herb can be used by people who have a 
genetic defect causing them to reject Cilantro.</p>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This herb can be found fresh 
in markets serving Southeast Asian communities, so is quite common 
here in Los Angeles. It is also found in markets serving Caribbean 
communities. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for $5.99 / pound, put up in 
foam trays holding about 5 ounces. It is quite perishable and should 
be used within a few days.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Cilantro is the usual substitute, but it must 
be used fresh, never dried, and it is not as strong.<p></p>
