<h2>Cumin</h2>  [Jeera (India), <i>Cuminum cyminum</i>]
<p>
Probably originating in southwestern Asia, this plant has been native 
to the region from the eastern Mediterranean to eastern India since 
prehistoric times. What we call "Cumin Seeds" is actually the dried fruit, 
which contains the seeds. This is one of the most important spices in 
Indian cuisine, generally combined 1 teaspoon to 1 Tablespoon coriander 
seed, but sometimes 1 to 1. It is also one of the most important spices 
in North Africa, the Levant and Middle East. It is significant in 
Europe as well, but often displaced by Caraway Seeds. In India it is 
sometimes called White Cumin to differentiate it from Black Cumin. 
The photo specimens were typically 0.188 inch long by 0.060 inch 
wide (4.8 x 1.5 mm).</p>

<h2>Black Cumin</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kala Jeera, Shahi Jeera 
  (India); Zireh Kuhi (Persia); Siyoh Dona (Tajiki), 
  <i>Elwendia persica</i> syn. <i>Bunium persicum</i>]
<p>
Fruits of this plant (called "seeds") are used in the cuisines of 
northern India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Persia - and are all but 
unknown outside that region, though the plant grows wild as far as 
southeastern Europe. It has a very different flavor and aroma than white 
cumin, so the two are not interchangeable.The photo specimens were 
typically 0.220 inch long by 0.020 wide (5.6 x 0.5 mm).</p>

<p>Leaves can be used as Parsley is, and the roots can be cooked, said 
to taste like sweet chestnuts, but only the fruits are available in 
North America.</p>
<p><h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; This spice is not to be confused with 
<a href="rn_nigelaz.html"><b>Nigella</b></a>, often also called 
"Black Cumin". This is not an English translation error, Nigella is 
actually called "Black Cumin" (Kalojira) in Bengal, where many of the 
early Indian immigrants came from (most of Bengal is now Bangladesh). 
Visually, they are easy to tell apart - Nigella seeds are tiny and 
teardrop shaped, not at all elongated.<p></p>

<h3>Dry Roasting:</h3> &nbsp; In the Indian cuisines, and to a lesser 
extent in Africa and the Middle East, Cumin (and other) seeds are dry 
roasted in a metal pan until they are very fragrant, but darkening just 
slightly. Keep shaking the pan for even heating and do not let them 
become hot enough to smoke.<p></p>
