<h3>Fresh Dill</h3>
<p>
Originating in Eastern Europe and/or Western Asia, dill has been cultivated 
since Neolithic times. The Talmud (Jewish law) requires tithes be paid in 
dill seeds and stems. and some stems were found in the tomb of 
Tutankhamen.</p>
<p>A favorite herb in Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, the Caucasus and into 
Persia and "the Stans", fresh dill is widely available in Los Angeles 
where those eths abound, but many Americans know it only as something 
that goes into dill pickles. Dill is also used through India and 
Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam.</p>

<h3>Dried Dill</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Dill Weed]
<p>
Dried dill is called for in many recipes. It's effect is far different 
from fresh dill, so substitutions either way should only be made if the 
other is unavailable.

<h3>Buying &amp; Storage:</h3> &nbsp; Avoid wilt or any yellowing, both 
of which indicate the bunch will soon go to rot. Fresh crisp dill, 
loosely wrapped in plastic and stored in the fidge will last about 5 
days, then decline rapidly.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh dill is often used raw, but also cooked in 
recipes. In either case the stems are quite tender, so when chopping you can 
include all the small stems. When using lengths to include in pickles 
larger stems can be included as they have quit a bit of the flavor.

<h2>Dill Seed</h2>

<p>
Dill Seed is surprisingly hard to find in regular supermarkets, 
it can be in tiny quantity for an outrageous price when it is found. It 
can, however, be easily found at reasonable prices in Indian and many 
other ethnic markets.</p>

<p>The seeds remains viable for 1 to 3 years, so 2 years is probably a 
good maximum storage time. Store away from light and heat in a well 
sealed jar.
