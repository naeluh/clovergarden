<h1>Fennel</h1>
<br><img src="img/py_fennelw01h.jpg" alt="Fennel Flower Heads" class=mrg>
[genus <i>Foeniculum</i> (fennel proper), genus <i>Ferula</i> 
  (giant fennel)]
<p>
Fennel is a member of the <i>Apiaceae</i> family (formerly 
<i>Umbelliferae</i>), also known as the Parsley family. Originating in 
the Mediterranean region, fennel is now grown in many regions of the 
world, as an herb, a spice, a vegetable and as a medicinal plant. It 
is also now a common invasive weed in North America, Asia and Australia. 
Today, India is the top producer by a wide margin, followed by Mexico, 
China and Iran.

<h2>Fennel Seed</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_fennels03g.jpg" alt="Fennel Seeds" class=mrg>
  [Saunf (Hindi); Mouri (Bengali); <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i>]
<p>
The aromatic seeds of common fennel have many culinary uses in the 
cuisines of most of the world. They are used to flavor liqueurs and other 
beverages as well as being a component of spice mixes and curries. In 
Italy they are much used as a flavoring ingredient in sausages. In 
India roasted seeds are used as an after meal breath freshner. They 
also have medicinal applications.</p>
<p>The photo shows common fennel seeds to the left. The photo 
specimens were typically 0.285 inch long and 0.080 inch wide 
(7.2 x 2.0 mm).</p> 

<h3>Luknow Fennel</h3>, shown to the right in the photo, is a special 
   variety from northern India which has a more intensely aromatic flavor 
   and is prefered in that region. The photo specimens were typically 
   0.233 inch long and 0.063 inch wide (5.9 x 1.6 mm).<p></p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The best place to buy is in 
an Indian market where you can buy any quantity you need very cheaply, 
and can be sure its fresh. Otherwise the ethnic section of most 
independent markets. The tiny jars in the big chain supermarkets are 
expensive, and could be years old. Store tightly sealed in a glass jar 
in a cool place away from light and it'll last about a year. Don't buy 
it ground which turns quickly to sawdust - grind your own as needed.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In India and parts of Africa, fennel seed is 
dry roasted before grinding and/or incorporated in a recipe. The seeds 
should become aromatic and darken only just slightly. Cool before 
grinding.

<h2 id="flor">Florence Fennel</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_fennel25g.jpg" alt="Fennel Bulb &amp; Fronds" class=mrg>
  [Finocchio.(Italy), Anise (US Supermarkets - in error), <i>Foeniculum 
      vulgare</i> var. <i>azoricum</i>]
<p>
This variety of <i>F. vulgare</i> is milder than other cultivars and 
grown for its swollen leaf bases which form a bulb-like structure. It is 
most used in Italy where the bulbs are prepared and consumed in many 
forms. The fronds are also used in salads and recipes.</p>
<p><b>Buying &amp; Storing:</b> &nbsp; Even most supermarkets here in 
North America now carry Florence Fennel. A big problem, though, is that 
most stores cut the stems way too short. Many recipes call for a fair 
amount of the leaves for additional flavor. Loosely wrapped, fennel 
bulbs will last about a week refrigerated. 
</p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Florence Fennel is often used raw, just thinly 
sliced, in salads and the like. For cooking it is usually sliced thicker, 
and cooked until tender. Don't overcook because it isn't that pleasant 
all mushy.

<h2 id="horse">Horse Fennel</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_fenhors02f.jpg" alt="Pickled Horse Fennel Stems" class=mrg>
  [Bokhi (Armenia); <i>Hippomarathrum siculum</i> alt <i>H. libanotis</i> 
  var. <i>siculum</i>]
<p>
   Native to Anatolia and Caucasus, this plant is technically not a fennel, 
   but it's commonly called "horse fennel", looks a lot like fennel and 
   smells and tastes a lot like fennel, so I'm placing it here. Its stems 
   are used in Armenia to make a pickle (as shown in the photo) commonly 
   used as an appetizer. It makes a mild pickle with a pleasant and 
   interesting fennel-like flavor. The stems are crunchy and occasionally 
   a bit fibrous. Stems in the specimen jar, packed in Armenia, were 4-1/2 
   inches long and up to 0.45 inches diameter. The plant grows to about 3 
   feet in height. The genus name <i>Hippomarathrum</i> roughly translates 
   to "makes horses crazy".
