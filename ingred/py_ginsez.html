<h1>Ginseng</h1>

[<i>Panax quinquefolius</i> (American); <i>Panax ginseng</i> (Korean)]
<p>
Of the two major species of Ginseng, the American, farm grown in 
   Wisconsin and Canada, is considered the best. Siberian Ginseng 
   (<i>Eleutherococcus senticosus</i>) belongs to a different genus and 
   has a different makeup of active ingredients. While considered 
   inferior, it's put to much the same uses as the <i>Panax</i> species 
   and is often deceptively sold as <i>Panax</i>. Given the reputation 
   of American ginseng, much of the Korean variety is put up in red, 
   white and blue packages and sold as "Wisconsin Ginseng", even by 
   Asian markets here in the USA. The photo specimens, from a Korean 
   market in Los Angeles, were 6-3/4 inches long and weighed 1-3/8 
   ounce (left) and 2 ounces (right).</p>

<p>Ginseng is reputed to improve libido and sexual performance, 
improve blood circulation, response to stress and recovery from 
weakness. Side effects are reputed to be insomnia and change in 
blood pressure (up or down). 

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Ginseng can be found fresh 
in some well stocked Korean markets, in the vegetable section. Dried 
and included in many potions it can be found in most Asian markets. 
The fresh root is fairly perishable. It should be refrigerated and 
used within a week.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Ginseng is used in a large number of 
medicinal soups and teas, most prominently chicken soups. It is 
particularly popular in China and Korea.<p></p>
