[Golpar (Persia); Angelica (English, Spanish, French (misnamed)); Persian 
Hogweed (English); Troms&oslash; palm (Norway); <i>Heracleum persicum</i>]
<p>
This plant is native to Iran and close surrounding regions, but is now 
naturalized in Norway and Sweden, and also in Finland where it is considered 
an invasive. The sap can cause <i>phytophotodermatitis</i> (burns and rashes) 
when contaminated skin is exposed to sunlight, though it is thought to be 
less dangerous than Giant Hogweed (<i>H. mantegazzianum</i>)</p>

<p>The winged Fruits, containing the seeds, have a light bitterness, a 
touch of citrus and a trace of fennel. It is similar in taste to Celery 
Seed (usually actually Lovage seed (better seed yield)) but more aromatic, 
and much lighter in intensity as it is ground including winged husks. In 
North America, Golpar is almost always sold ground, as it is usually so 
used in Persian cuisines, but I find the ground product lacks the citrus 
tone of the whole fruit. In Iran, it is most often sold as whole fruit, 
to be ground as needed.</p>

<p>The ground fruits of this plant are much used in Persian (Iranian) cuisine, 
especially for sprinkling on cucumbers, pomegranate seeds, cooked vegetables, 
broad beans, lentils and the like. It is also used in soups and stews, and a 
small amount (2 teaspoons / pound) may be cooked with beans, said to reduce 
farting. It is also used mixed with vinegar as a dip, particularly for Broad 
Beans. As a sprinkle, it may be used alone or combined with an equal amount 
of salt (golpar namac).</p>
<p>Tender shoots and leaves are often pickled (golpar 
torshi), and the flower petals are used in a spice mix for flavoring rice, 
chicken and fish. &nbsp; Subst: Celery Seed, but at most half the amount 
as it is much more intense, but it is less aromatic.
