<p>
This perennial plant is native to southern Europe and southwestern Asia, 
but its exact place of origin is unknown, because it has been in 
cultivation so long. Lovage was a very important flavoring herb during 
the Roman Empire and is still used in parts of Southern and Eastern 
Europe, and especially in Georgia, but has fallen out of general 
culinary use in other regions. The closest substitute we have is Celery 
Leaves, particularly from Chinese / Cutting Celery, but it's far from 
perfect. Lovage flavor is similar to a combination of celery and parsley, 
and quite a bit stronger than celery leaves. The plant is often used as 
an insect repelling companion plant, and all parts have been used in 
herbal medicine.

<p>The "seed" is actually a tiny dried fruit containing two seeds. 
Strangely, what is sold commercially as "Lovage Seed" is often actually 
Ajwan Seed, while much of what is sold as "Celery Seed" is actually part 
or wholly lovage seed.</p>

<p>Lovage leaves are used in salads, and particularly in soups and broths.
The roots can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable, or grated for salads.
The seeds are used similarly as fennel seeds. In Romania it is used dried, 
along with seeds, as a flavoring for pickled cabbage and cucumbers.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Well, in North America, not likely - you have 
to grow it yourself.</p>

<p><b>Substitute:</b> &nbsp; Use a combination of 2 parts Celery leaves 
to 1 part flat leaf Parsley leaves, and use more of this than the amount 
of Lovage called for in the recipe.</p>

<p><b>Health &amp; Nutrition:</b> &nbsp; Lovage roots contain 
Furanocoumarin compounds that can cause Phytophotodermatitis from 
handling them.</p>
