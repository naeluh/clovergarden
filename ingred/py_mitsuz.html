[Mitsuba (Japan); Japanese wild parsley, Japanese cryptotaenia, Japanese 
honewort, white chervil; San ye qin (China); <i>Cryptotaenia japonica</i>]
<p>Native to Japan, Korea, eastern China, and Vietnam, this herb is called 
for in many Japanese recipes. This is a problem, as Mitsuba is available 
only in Japanese markets and in some Korean markets. The roots are also 
edible.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is used mainly raw or as a garnish, as 
the flavor is destroyed and it becomes bitter with more than couple minutes 
cooking. Tender stems may be blanched and used with the leaves. Roots are 
blanched and used in stir fries and the like. Young sprouts are used in 
salads.<p></p>
 
<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; None exact. Flatleaf Parsley is more robust in flavor 
and texture. Celery Leaf and Cilantro, or a combination, are also suggested.

[<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>]

<p>Native in the United States from North Dakota south to Texas and east to 
the to the Atlantic. In Canada, Manatoba east to the Atlantic. Some botanists 
consider this to be the same species as Mitsuba, but others differ.  In any 
case, culinary usage for this plant is the same as for Mitsuba, including 
edible roots.
