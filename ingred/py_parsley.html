<p>This very important culinary family grows the world around, mainly in 
temperate climates but some into the subtropics.</p>

<h2>Alexanders</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_alexan02h.jpg" alt="Flowering Alexanders Plant" class=mrg>
[Horse Parsley, Black Lovage, Macedonia Parsley, Wild Celery; 
<i>Smyrnium olusatrum</i>]
<p>
Alexanders is native to the Mediterranean region and has been used as a 
culinary and medicinal herb from the times of ancient Greece through the 
Medieval period. It has since fallen almost entirely out of use, 
displaced by celery. This plant still grows wild through much of Europe, 
and as far north as the British Isles, having been carried far and wide 
by the Roman Legions. Its flavor is between celery and parsley, with 
leaves, stems, roots and flower buds all edible. The small black seeds 
are also edible and were used as a substitute for pepper.

<h2 id="angel">Angelica</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_angelica01h.jpg" alt="Angelica leaves" class=mrg>
[<i>Angelica archangelica</i> (garden angelica), 
<i>Angelica sylvestris</i> (wild angelica)]
<p>
Angelica is native to the subarctic regions of the northern 
hemisphere and grows as far north as Lapland. While there are many 
angelica species, only the two listed above are of culinary interest. 
To have it on hand you must grow it yourself - it likes damp soil, 
growing leaves the first year and going to seed the second year.</p>
<p>Angelica grows wild in Scandinavia where it is quite popular and is 
cultivated in one region of France, mostly for flavoring liqueurs and 
medicinal properties. It is also used to flavor omelets, some fish dishes 
and jams. Angelica is more gently "perfumy" than other members of the 
parsley tribe. Wild angelica has been used mainly as an emergency food.

<h2>Anise</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_anises01h.jpg" alt="Anise Seeds" class=mrg>
[<i>Pimpinella anisum</i>]
<p>
Native to the Eastern Mediterranean region, the dried fruits are an 
important flavoring there. The vegetable sold as "Anise" in grocery 
stores is actually Fennel. Anise is not sold as a fresh herb or 
vegetable.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Ajwain</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_ajwans01h.jpg" alt="Ajwain Seeds" class=mrg>
[Carom seed, Ajowan; Omam (Tamil); Ajmo (Gujarati); Owa (Marathi); 
<i>Trachyspermum copticum</i>]
<p>
Originating in Egypt or the Middle East, the dried fruits of this 
plant are now used mainly in India but also in Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea 
and Ethiopia. It is said to reduce flatulence from beans if cooked with 
them. Ajwain contains thymol and raw it smells and tastes like thyme but 
stronger, harsher and with some bitterness. Raw ajwain can overwhelm a 
dish if not used with discretion. In India it is always dry roasted or 
fried before using, which tempers the flavor. Some sources say ajwain is 
lovage seed but that is incorrect.</p>
<p> The leaves are also edible, but this plant is not cultivated in 
North America. Ajwain seeds should be stored in a tightly sealed 
container away from heat and sunlight, but still should be used within 
6 months or so because the flavorful oils evaporate fairly quickly. 
This spice has an affinity for breads and starchy foods, including 
potatoes, beans and lentils. It is also used in Takdas (Tempering), 
oil fried spices used as a finishing touch in many Indian dishes, 
particularly in the south.  It is considered a digestive aid and to 
reduce flatulence from beans.

<h2>Arracacha</h2>

[Apio (Puerto Rico), Apio Criollo (Venezuela), Zanahoria Blanca (Ecuador),

<i>Arracacia xanthorriza</i>]
<p>
This parsley root, native to the Andes region of South America is a major 
crop in Brazil but popular all over South America and the Caribbean region.
The flesh may be white, yellow or purple. It is put to uses similar to 
potatoes but has a more distinctive flavor and in some cultivars intense 
color. Leaves are used as a flavoring herb and young stems are cooked as 
a vegetable similarly to celery. Roots sold in Puerto Rico are quite 
different from those in the photo - see

<h2>Caraway</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_caraways01h.jpg" alt="Caraway Seeds" class=mrg>
[<i>Anethum graveolens</i>]
<p>
Native to western Asia and Europe the dried fruits of this plant are 
used mostly in the cuisines of Central and Northern Europe to flavor bread, 
sauerkraut, cheeses, liquors, casseroles and other foods. They also have a 
long history of medicinal use. The roots may be cooked as a root vegetable 
but are not grown commercially for that purpose.

<p>The carrot probably originated in Afghanistan which is still the 
center of diversity for wild carrots.</p>

<h3>Domestic carrots</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. 
<i>sativus</i>] were first used mainly for their greens, but durring 
Medieval and Rennaisance times, versions with larger, non-woody roots 
were developed. The orange root carrot so familiar today first appeared 
in the Netherlands during the 17th century. Our market varieties are 
naturally white or orange, but yellow, red, maroon, purple and nearly 
black varieties have been developed, and one that's purple on the 
outside and orange on the inside. They now come in many sizes and 
shapes.

<h2>Celery</h2>
<br>[<i>Apium graveolens</i> (common), <i>Apium prostratum</i> 
(Australian)] &nbsp; 
Except for the Australian variety (<i>Apium prostratum</i>, all common 
celeries are cultivars of a single species, <i>A. graveolens</i>. 
This species is native to the Mediterranean region. While celery was well 
known to the ancient Egyptians it is not known if they cultivated it, 
since it was a common weed there. Celery was definitely cultivated 
during the Greek and Roman empires. Before Rome, celery was used 
medicinally, but the Romans seem to have started cooking with it, 
though with caution. Development of modern varieties with thick stems 
or large "roots" began in the 1600s.<p></p>

   <img src="img/py_celery13d.jpg" alt="Untrimmed Pascal Celery Head" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>A. graveolens</i>  var <i>dulce</i>]
   <p>
   Celery grown in North America is almost entirely the Pascal cultivar, 
   which produces very large, mild flavored stems that are less fibrous 
   than earlier varieties were. California is far and away the largest 
   producer, but a fair amount is grown in Florida. The photo specimen 
   was 27 inches long and weighed 1-3/4 pounds, but heads over 3 pounds 
   are common. There are also red varieties but these are considered 
   less desirable.  In Europe a "self blanching" variety is favored.

   Selinon (Latin); <i>A. graveolens</i> var. <i>secalinum</i>]
   <p>
   Probably much like celery grown in Europe before 1600, this plant has 
   relatively thin stems, is stronger in flavor and is more fibrous than 
   Pascal celery. It is now grown in California and available in the many 
   Asian markets here. If your recipe calls for it and you can't get it, 
   buy the leafiest head of regular celery you can find, and use the part 
   above the first joint where the flavor is stronger. The specimens 
   were 30 inches long with stems about 1/2 inch wide 5 inches above 
   the leaf base. Both stems and leaves are used in recipes from China 
   and Southeast Asia. &nbsp;

   [Celeriac, Knob celery, Turnip rooted celery, <i>A. graveolens</i> 
   var <i>rapaceum</i>]
   <p>
   Developed in Europe during the Renaissance, this form is particularly 
   popular in France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Once little 
   known in North America, celeriac has lately become more widely 
   available, with California a major producer. The part eaten is not 
   actually a root, but a swollen stem, from which the leaves sprout.
   These "roots" range in size from 7 ounces to over 2 pounds. The larger 
   of the photo specimens was 6-1/2 inches long, 4-1/4 inches diameter 
   and weighed 2 pounds. &nbsp;

   <h3>Wild Celery</h3>
   <br>[Smallage; <i>A. graveolens</i> var <i>graveolens</i>] &nbsp; This 
   ancestor of the domesticated celeries looks pretty much like Chinese / 
   Cutting Celery, which is also sometimes called "Smallage". It is grown 
   for production of celery seed, putting more of its energy into seeds 
   rather than stems and leaves.<p></p>

   <h3>Celery Seed</h3>

   <img src="img/py_celseed02h.jpg" alt="Celery Seeds" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>A. graveolens</i> var <i>graveolens</i>]
   <p>
   Celery seed (actually very tiny fruits) is produced from "Wild Celery"  
   rather than the Pascal variety. Much of what is sold as "celery seed" 
   is mixed with, or even entirely <a href="py_lovagez.html">Lovage</a> 
   seed. Apparently lovage is a better seed producer, but is very closely 
   related to and very similar to wild celery. Celery seed has been 
   used for thousands of years, both as a flavoring spice and for 
   its medicinal properties.

[Gourmet's parsley, Garden Chervil, <i>Anthriscus cerefolium</i>, 
<i>Apium prostratum</i> (Australian)]
<p>
This plant, native to the Caucasus, was spread through Europe during the 
Roman Empire and today is used there mostly in France. The leaves have a 
more delicate flavor than parsley and with a hint of liquorice. Today it 
is commonly called for in gourmet magazine recipes to help you feel 
inadequate because you can't get it. I imagine it can be had at the Santa 
Monica Farmer's Market, but nothing's going to get me to drive to Santa 
Monica at dawn on Saturday to do battle with desperate chefs from all those 
fancy West Side restaurants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it can almost always be found put up in 26 oz jars 
of brine at markets serving an Armenian or Turkish community (see 
<a href="py_chervz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>).</p> 
<p>There is another variety which, as with parsley, is grown for its roots 
rather than leaves. This is commonly used in France to flavor soups and 
pretty much nowhere else.

<h2>Coriander - Cilantro</h2>
<br>Originating in Western Asia and/or Southern Europe, coriander has 
been cultivated at least since the days of Tutankhamen and gathered wild 
from deep into prehistory. It was brought to North America by the first 
English and Dutch settlers. All parts of the plant are edible.<p></p>

   <p>
   This herb was 
   once in common use all over Europe, but has been almost completely 
   supplanted by parsley. In Europe, only traditional recipes in southern 
   Portugal and Spain's Canary Islands still call for it. On the other 
   hand, it is greatly used in most non-European cuisines worldwide. 
   There is a strong "I hate Cilantro" movement on the Internet, but the 
   condition has proven curable by exposure.</p>
   <p>The roots are also edible but are used only in the cuisine of 
   Thailand, and to a lesser extent in some of its neighbors. Used as a 
   component of curry pastes and in some soups, they are still hard to 
   get even here in Southern California.

   fruits containing the seeds. While not now used in Europe to anywhere 
   near the extent they were in Medieval times, coriander seeds are still 
   used in pickling and sausage making. In India they are used in vast 
   quantity for all manner of curries and spice mixtures, almost always 
   with Cumin at a ratio of about 1 T Coriander to 1 t cumin. This 
   combination was also popular in Imperial Rome and is used in Africa

This herb is native to Mexico, Central and South America, but is now 
grown worldwide. As a culinary herb it is most important in Southeast 
Asia, the far northeast of India, and the Caribbean. It is sometimes 
described as tasting like Cilantro, but stronger. I find the resemblance

&nbsp; <u>Caution:</u> &nbsp; This spice is not to be confused with 
Nigella, often also called "Black Cumin". This is not an English 
translation error, nigella is actually called "black cumin" in Bengal, 
where many of the early Indian immigrants came from (most of Bengal is

   <p>
   Native to Anatolia and Caucasus, this plant is technically not a 
   fennel, but is commonly called "horse fennel", so I'm placing it here. 
   Its stems are used in Armenia to make a pickle (as shown in the photo) 
   commonly used as an appetizer. It makes a mild pickle with a pleasant 
   and interesting fennel-like flavor. The stems are crunchy and 
   occasionally a bit fibrous. Stems in the specimen jar, packed in 
   Armenia, were 4-1/2 inches long and up to 0.45 inches diameter. The 
   plant grows to about 3 feet in height. The genus name 
   <i>Hippomarathrum</i> roughly translates to "makes horses crazy".

   This plant, apparently a giant fennel, provided several of the most 
   important sauces and condiments of ancient Greece and Rome. Juice from the stems and 
   roots, the stems themselves and most important the resin exuded from cuts just 
   above the root were used. So important was this plant to the ancient cuisines 
   they cannot be accurately reproduced without it. Unfortunately it is not 
   currently available due to presumed extinction (some still hope it can be 
   found somewhere in the wilds of Libya).

<b><u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>eat</u></b> - this is one of the most toxic 
plants known to man, just a few leaves are enough to kill an adult. The 
powerful neurotoxin can also be absorbed through the skin from handling

paralyzed. I describe it here as a warning not to eat just any herb that 
looks like a carrot - and there are others similarly toxic</p>
<p>While native to Europe it has been introduced to North America and is 
now widespread, particularly in the Mountain West where it is easily 
confused with wild carrot and other plants valued by Native Americans for 
food and medicine. It has also been introduced to Australia. This plant 
grows only in places where the soil is permanently moist. Identify it by 
crushing leaves which will have a rank and musty smell, not spicy. Wash 
your hands after crushing to avoid absorbing the toxin. &nbsp;

   This plant is native all through Europe and east to Central Asia. It 
   has been introduced to Canada and the United States, growing well in 
   rich, moist soils. It grows to an average of just under 4 feet tall, 
   and a maximum of a little over 6 feet. The sap can cause 
   phytophotodermatitis (burns and rashes) when contaminated skin is 
   exposed to sunlight. It is not nearly as dangerous as Giant Hogweed 
   (<i>H. mantegazzianum</i>) but caution is advised, and it can also be 
   confused with some very toxic plants, like various Hemlocks. The 
   live plant looks just like the American Cow Parsnip below.</p>
   <p>Pickled stems of this plant (just like those shown in the photo) 
   were the original ingredient in the famous sour soup, Borscht, long 
   before beets were used. These pickled stems are now used on herbal 
   appetizer spreads in Armenia. It is suspected it was the plant once 
   used on the  Kamchatka Peninsula to ferment and distill into an 
   alcoholic beverage called "raka". The photo specimens, from Armenia, 
   were packed in a 25 ounce jar (13 ounces dry weight) selling for 2020 
   US $5.99 ($7.37 / pound dry weight). The largest stem (in front) was 
   triangular and 3/4 inch across. The rest were around 1/2 inch diameter

<p>
This perennial plant is native to southern Eruope and southwestern Asia, 
but its exact place of origin is unknown, because it has been in 
cultivation so long. Lovage was a very important flavoring herb during 
the Roman Empire and is still used in parts of Southern and Eastern 
Europe, and especially in Georgia, but has fallen out of general 
culinary use in other regions. The closest substitute we have is Celery 
Leaves, particularly from Chinese / Cutting Celery, but it's far from 
perfect. Lovage flavor is similar to a combination of celery and parsley, 
and quite a bit stronger than celery leaves. The seeds are used as a 
seasoning and the roots are cooked as a vegetable. All parts of the 
plant have been used medicinally.

   Two forms are available, flat leaf 
   (Italian) and curly leaf. Flat leaf parsley has a leafy texture, 
   stronger, more complex flavor, and is used in cooking.  Curly leaf is 
   used as a decorative garnish, having a texture similar to plastic and 
   flavor to match. Like plastic it is very resistant to wilting, which 
   enhances its decorative usefulness. Dried parsley has little flavor 
   so fresh parsley, now available year-round, should always be used, 
   unless you are trying to accurately reconstruct recipes from the 
   Eisenhower era, but who would want to do that? &nbsp;

[<i>Pastinaca sativa</i>]
<p>
Native to Eurasia, parsnips have been eaten since ancient times and 
were carried north by the Romans who found they grew much larger in colder 
climates. They are harvested after the first sharp frost as their flavor 
improves from this exposure. They are not grown in frost free climates for 
this reason.  In recent times parsnips have been overshadowed 
by the potato but are still featured in some European traditional meals. 
Today they are often used to flavor soups and stews. Parsnips are less 
crisp, sweeter and milder but more aromatic in flavor than carrots. The 
center photo specimen was 8-3/4 inches long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and 
weighed 7-1/2 ounces. &nbsp; 
<a href="py_parsnz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.</p>
<p><b>Wild Parsnips</b> should be avoided as their foliage contain a 
chemical that sensitize the skin to sunlight, resulting in severe burns. 
They are also easy to confuse with <a href="py_parsley.html#heml">Hemlock</a>, an

Order <i>Saxifragales</i>, nor did the picture on the label resemble
these.</p>
<p>The product was clearly more related to Fennel (Order <i>Apiales</i>). 
Based on all evidence available to me, I have identified it as 
Pepper-Saxifrage, which does prefer to grow in open meadows. The 
"pepper" part of its name is because the root tastes peppery. The 
photo specimens were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles (Sunland), packed in brine in a 720 ml jar for 
2017 US $4.99.  The contents of the jar was a nice mild herbal pickle

in some parts of North America, but not an aggressive one.</p>
<p>Many recipes, calling this plant "Korean Watercress", and say 
Watercress is a suitable substitute, but it really isn't. The flavor and 
texture are very different. This plant tastes more like a mix of carrot 
tops and celery, with a hint of resin. The specimen bundle, purchased at
