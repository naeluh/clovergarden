[<i>Petroselinum crispum</i>]
<p>
<b>Leaves:</b> &nbsp; Two forms are available, flat leaf (Italian) 
   and curly leaf. Flat leaf parsley has a leafy texture, stronger, more 
   complex flavor and is used in cooking.  Curly leaf is used as a decorative 
   garnish, having a texture similar to plastic and flavor to match. Like 
   plastic it is very resistent to wilting which enhances its decorative 
   usefulness. Dried parsley has little flavor so fresh parsley, now available 
   year-round, should always be used, unless you are trying to accurately 
   reconstruct recipes from the Eisenhower era.</p>
<p><b>Fruit (Parsley seed)</b> &nbsp; The seeds are little used for 
   culinary purposes except to grow parsley from. Getting it to sprout 
   is not easy because its outer coating contains a substance that supresses 
   sprouting. If grown in pots they should be deep to accomodate the 
   tap root. The seed does find some use in the herbal supplement 
   industry.

<p>Parsley is used sparingly in American and European cooking, but is used 
in much larger quantity in the cooking of Turkey, North Africa, the 
Caucasus, and Central Asia, where recipes can call for a cup of chopped 
parsley.</p>
<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Always buy flat leaf parsley for 
cooking. Preferably buy fresh once a week, though if properly prepared it 
can keep in the fridge for about a week before it starts to yellow and 
lose flavor.
<p>Parsley should be crisp and not at all wilted. If just a trifle wilted 
it can be refreshed by cutting off the bottom of the stems and setting in 
a cup of cold water, perhaps acidulated with just a few grains of citric 
acid. When recovered, trim the stems again and rake out any loose bits 
or yellowed leaves. Wrap lightly and refrigerate.

<h2 id="root">Parsley Root</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_pyroot08f.jpg" alt="Roots" class=mrg>
[<i>Petroselinum crispum</i>] 
<p>
Root Parsley varieties have been developed that produce large tap roots 
which are popular in cuisines of Central and Eastern Europe. The flavor 
is more delicate and herbal and far less sweet than that of parsnips 
so they are not at all interchangeable.

<br>

<h3>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Parsley roots can 
be found in markets that serve a significant Central or Eastern European 
community. I find them in several multi-ethnic markets here in Los 
Angeles. Leave all or just an inch of the tops on and wrap loosley in 
plastic - they'll keep for at least 3 weeks refrigerated.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Parsley root is generally cut into pieces before 
adding to soups and stews. It does not need long cooking, becoming tender 
in 5 minutes or so.<p></p>
