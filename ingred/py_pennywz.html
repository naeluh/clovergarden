<h1>Pennywort</h1>
<br><img src="img/py_pennyw04f.jpg" alt="Fresh Pennywort Leaves" class=mrg>
[Gotu kola (Sri Lanka); Dollarwort (U.S.); 
  Rau-ma (Viet); Myin-kwa-ywet (Burma); Pegaga (Malay); Buabok (Thai); 
  Pegagan (Indonesia); Takip-kohol (Philippine); <i>Hydrocotyle</i> or 
  <i>Centella asiatica</i> (small variety) <i>H.</i> or <i>C. javanica</i> 
  (larger variety)]
<p>
Pennyworts grow worldwide in wet and moist tropical and temperate areas 
but the varieties of most culinary interest are native to Southeast Asia, 
Sri Lanka and Australia. Botanists variously place them in family 
<i>Apiaceae</i> with carrots and parsley or in family <i>Araliaceae</i> 
with ginseng or in family <i>Mackinlayaceae</i> with a few Australian 
plants of little note. The largest photo specimen (<i>C. javanica</i>) 
is 3-1/2 inches across the leaf.</p>

<p>Non-Asian species have fully round leaves with the stem attached near 
the middle of the underside. Water Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle 
ranunculoides</i>) is native to North and South America and grows in 
water with the leaves floating on the surface. <i>Hydrocotyle 
vulgaris</i> looks like ranunculoides but grows out of water, is native 
to North Africa, Europe and Florida, and the variety noted in English 
and European herbals. All common species are edible.</p>

<p>Pennywort is found in markets serving Vietnamese communities. It is 
generally sold in bags weighing about 1 pound labeled Rau-Ma, Pennywort 
or both. I don't see it often but have purchased it in May and June. 
See our recipe <a href="../recipes/sxv_pennywort1.html"><b>Pennywort 
Drink</b></a>, a very common use for this herb.</p>

<p><u>Yield</u>: A pound will yield about 4-1/2 ounces of leaves and the 
rest stems. At $5/pound with stems that four ounces of leaf is pretty 
costly, so if I make salad from the leaves I use the stems for pennywort 
drink - not so pretty green as with leaves but better looking and better 
tasting than the canned stuff.</p>

<p>Medicinally, pennywort has a considerable reputation as a tonic. It is 
considered a blood purifier and good for eyes, nervous conditions, memory 
and arthritis. It is reported with some medical support that a paste is 
helpful in healing wounds and reducing scaring. It is also often applied 
as a facial for a more youthful appearance.</p>

<p>Pennywort is quite perishable and should be kept bagged and 
refrigerated and used within a couple days of purchase.</p>
