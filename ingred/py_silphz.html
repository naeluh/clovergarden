<h1>Silphium / Laser</h1>

  [Laser (Rome), Silphium (Greece), <i>Ferula ?????</i>]
<p>
This plant, apparently a giant fennel, provided several of the most 
important sauces and condiments of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as 
medicinals there and in Egypt. Juice from the stems and roots, the stems 
themselves and most important the resin exuded from cuts just above the 
root were used. So important was this plant to the ancient cuisines they 
cannot be accurately reproduced without it. Unfortunately it is not 
currently available due to presumed extinction (some still hope it can be 
found somewhere in the wilds of Libya).</p>
<p>While other members of the fennel family have been sold as "silphium", 
true silphium grew only around the city of Cyrene in Libya, North Africa. 
While Pliny wrote that silphium of Cyrene was extinct in the 1st century
CE, it appears from other writers it still existed there in the 5th 
century CE, but they may have mistaken another fennel for it. Several 
varieties of African fennel have been proposed as "silphium" but all 
ancient representations of the plant distinctly show a striated stem 
and leaf petioles in nearly opposite pairs. No fennel like this has yet been 
found. <i>Ferula tingitana</i> is thought to be the nearest living 
relative.  &nbsp; <small>Photo of coin from Cyrene believed in the

<p>Greek and Roman writers did not describe silphium's taste 
characteristics in detail - everyone already knew them. What we do know 
is that <a href="py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a>, available with 
somewhat different characteristics from various regions, was considered 
inferior to true silphium. In particular silphium did not have the 
sulphurous odor asafoetida has. This is, however,  a point of similarity 
we can work from. Since asafoetida is as close as we can get today, it is 
good that the unmistakable smell of SAE 90 weight hypoid gear oil 
disappears if the resin is properly fried in hot oil for just a few 
seconds before adding other ingredients.</p>
<p>Other parts of the plant were also used but are now unavailable except 
in Persia and Afghanistan where asafoetida is grown. I have developed a 
recipe, <a href="../recipes/yyv_laser1.html"><b>Laser Root / Stem / 
Juice</b></a> to fake up a substitute.</p>
