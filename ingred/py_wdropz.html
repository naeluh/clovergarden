[Java Water Dropwort, Water Celery, Vietnamese Celery;  Minari (Korea); 
  Rau Can, Can Nuoc (Viet); Seri (Japan); Komprek (Manipur, India); 
  <i>Oenanthe javanica</i>]
<p>Most Water Dropworts (Genus <i>Oenanthe</i>) are toxic to extremely 
toxic, but this one, native to East Asia, is edible. Its thin hollow 
stems are topped with celery-like leaves. This plant is sometimes called 
"Chinese celery" and "Japanese parsley", but those names properly belong 
to completely different plants (both found on our Parsley page). This 
plant is also grown in Italy as spring greens, and is an invasive 
in some parts of North America, but not an aggressive one.</p>
<p>Many recipes, calling this plant "Korean Watercress", and say 
Watercress is a suitable substitute, but it rally isn't. The flavor and 
texture are very different. This plant tastes more like a mix of carrot 
tops and celery, with a hint of resin. The specimen bundle, purchased at 
a local Korean market in Los Angeles, was about 15 inches long.</p>

<p>Minari is particularly popular in Korea, where it is sold in long 
stemmed bundles. While all parts of the plant are edible, many Korean 
recipes call just for the tender stems, with leaves removed. In Japan, 
the leaves are often used in soups and salads, and the roots are also 
cooked and eaten.

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This herb can be found fresh 
in some well stocked Korean markets, in the vegetable section, but 
quality can vary considerably from day to day. I have also recently 
found it (3 2017) in a large Asian market in San Gabriel at 2017 US 
$2.99 / pound. The plant wilts fairly quickly, so should be kept 
loosely bagged in the fridge and used soon after purchase.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; This is a difficult problem. Probably thin strips 
of celery are your best bet, particularly if cut from above the first 
joint, up where the leaves are.<p></p>
