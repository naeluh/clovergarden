<span class=bg>Most Americans don't think of reptiles and amphibians as 
something to eat,</span> but actually far more frogs are eaten in the 
U.S. South and Great Lakes region than in France, rattlesnakes are eaten 
in the U.S. Southwest (albeit as a "specialty" item) and Alligator is 
becoming more popular around the country. The influx of people from 
Southeast Asia since the Vietnam War has greatly extended the scope of 
reptile consumption (and availability).

Fish in shallow waters learned to breath air as a matter of 
survival. A variety of lobe finned fish took a liking to land (plenty of 
big bugs to eat and no sharks) and evolved into a "Tetrapod Amphibian",  This 
chart shows its descendants (for simplicity extinct (thus inedible) and minor 
lines and some intermediate phases have been omitted).</p>

[American Alligator <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, Chinese Alligator 
<i>Alligator sinensis</i>]
<p>
Alligators are now known not to be reptiles but related to birds through 
a common dinosaur ancestor. American alligators are found in the 
southeast of the U.S. from North Carolina down and around Florida to the 
coastal areas of Texas but most live in Florida and Louisiana. The 
largest alligator on record was over 19 feet but they are commonly around 
8 feet.</p>
<p>While the American Alligator is doing well and is also extensively 
farmed, the Chinese alligator lives only along the Yangtze River and is 
endangered. In the U.S. alligator has been harvested primarily for hides 
but the meat is becoming increasingly popular.

[family <i>Ranidae</i> (true frogs) mostly genus <i>Rana</i> 
(over 230 species)]
<p>
While one species of frog (<i>Conraua goliath</i>) can grow to 7 pounds, 
the edible frogs of commerce are generally less than 1 pound. While frog 
eating is commonly associated with France (due to horrified Englishmen), 
they are much more commonly eaten in the U.S. South and Midwest, the 
Caribbean, China and Southeast Asia. In most cases only the hind legs are 
eaten though in some areas for some species the back is also used.</p>
<p> Frozen frog legs from China and Vietnam are now common in U.S. 
markets serving local Asian communities. In Europe the most eaten frog 
is the Edible Frog (<i>Rana kl. esculenta</i>). In the U.S. the most 
eaten frog is the American Bull Frog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>), a very 
large frog that can grow to 1.5 pounds and is farmed in some areas.

[Green Iguana <i>Iguana iguana</i>]
<p>
The Green Iguana is native to Central and South America and the Caribbean 
Islands and grows to 6 feet long and over 10 pounds. Iguanas hatched in 
captivity make good pets <b>if given proper care and feeding</b> which may 
not be easy in non-tropical locations. Wild iguanas seldom survive in 
captivity.</p>
<p>While green iguanas are eaten in Central and South America they 
are CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) 
listed as Appendix II "threatened" so I don't recommend eating them. 
They should also not be purchased as pets unless their fairly demanding 
care and feeding needs can be met - for a period of 20 years or more.

[genus <i>Crotalus</i>, (27 species), also genus <i>Sistrurus</i> 
(3 species)]
<p>
Rattlesnakes are native to North and South America and are among the most 
venomous snakes in the world. Some species can grow to more than 8 feet long 
but the famous Western Diamondback rarely exceeds 6 feet. Rattlesnakes figure 
in the cuisines of the U.S. Southwest and Mexico and are available from 
specialty meat stores. The flavor is similar to a free range chicken thigh 
but chewier.

[order <i>Testudines</i>, family <i>Geoemydidae</i> (Asian river turtles, 
Asian box turtles), family <i>Trionychidae</i> (softshell turtles), 
family <i>Emydidae</i> (American box and pond turtles), family 
<i>Chelydridae</i> (snapping turtles)]
<p>
The first known turtle is from the early Triassic, more than 240 million 
years ago and long before modern lizards and snakes appeared, but it was 
so well developed there were probably turtles long before that. Originally 
land animals, a fair number of species took up life in the water and some 
even became sea creatures, but they still need to come onto land to lay 
their eggs.</p>
<p>Turtles are traditionally grouped with the <i>Anapsid</i> reptiles but 
some paleontologists now believe their anapsid style skull was a reversion 
from a <i>Diapsid</i> form which would make <i>Anapsids</i> totally 
extinct.

   [family <i>Cheloniidae</i> (5 species) &nbsp; | &nbsp; family

   <p>
   Sea turtles are land reptiles that have returned to the sea, but adult 
   females travel to the sandy beach where they hatched to lay their eggs 
   above the high tide mark. This is often a trip of thousands of miles 
   from the foraging grounds. Baby turtles, after hatching, head 
   immediately for the sea, but are extremely vulnerable to predation by 
   land animals. Once in the sea they are extremely vulnerable to 
   predation by sharks. Those that make it through this experience 
   (about 1%) may live long lives if not accidently caught and drowned 
   by fishing gear.</p>
   <p><b>All sea turtles are Internationally listed as "Endangered" or 
   "Threatened"</b> and protected by national laws and international 
   treaties. They should not be disturbed, captured or eaten, nor should 
   their nests and eggs be disturbed. All sea turtles in U.S. waters are 
   protected by the Endangered Species Act which establishes substantial 
   penalties for placing them at risk.
