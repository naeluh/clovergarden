<h1>African Rice</h1>
<br><img src="img/ri_africa01h.jpg" alt="Woman Harvesting Rice" class=mrg>
[<i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>indica</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Oryza glaberrima</i> (Upland Rice) &nbsp; | &nbsp; NERICA (New Rice 
for Africa)]<p></p>

<h3>Upland Rice</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Oryza glaberrima</i>) &nbsp; Native to Africa, 
this rice has been cultivated for over 3000 years. It does not need the 
tremendous amount of water <i>Oryza sativa</i> needs. This is the kind of 
rice promoted by Thomas Jefferson, when he noted the extreme amount of 
disease suffered by slaves working in paddy fields. This rice is well suited 
to African conditions, with low requrements for water and labor, pest 
resistant, easy to harvest, and leafy, so it supresses weeds. It has one 
severe problem: yields are half that of Indica rice varieties. Today, it 
constitutes an estimated 20% of African rice production.<p></p>

<h3>Asian Rice</h3> &nbsp; (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) &nbsp; Brought to Africa by 
various trade routes, this is now the predominant rice in Africa. It can only 
be grown where water is very plentiful and easy to control. Disease is still 
a problem for the paddy workers.<p></p>

<h3>NERICA Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a forced hybrid of <i>Oryza glaberrima</i> 
and <i>Oryza sativa</i>. The two don't hybridize successfully under natural 
circumstances, so advanced laboratory methods had to be used. These methods 
proved successful, producing dryland varieties with the high yields of Asian 
paddy grown rice. NERICA plantings in Uganda allowed the country to halve the 
amount of imported rice. There are, however, Intellectual Property issues 
to be worked out.<p></p>

<h3>Imported Rice:</h3> &nbsp; There is little hope that even with NERCA rice, 
Africa will be able to supply its demand for rice. Currently most rice 
consumed in Africa is imported, with a high impact on fragile economies.

<h2>Rice Varieties Used in Africa</h2>
<p></p>

   <h3 id="basmat">Basmati</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribasm06h.jpg" alt="Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
   Africa imports most of its rice, and some of that is Basmati from India, 
   pretty much all into East Africa, which has had a close trade relationship 
   with Inda for thousands of years. It is grown in northern India and 
   Pakistan, in the foothills of the Himalayas. This is a long grain 
   distinctly aromatic rice that stands up well to robust flavors. The 
   grains are very long and properly cooked stay very separate and fluffy. 
   Typically 1 cup of rice takes 1-7/8 cups of water and makes 3 cups. The 
   photo specimens were typically 0.290 inch long by 0.060 inch wide 
   (7.4 x 1.5 mm). The grains expand greatly in length when cooked. The 
   photo specimens cooked out to about 1/2 inch long (13 mm).

   <h3>Basmati Sella</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribassel03h.jpg" alt="Sella Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   This is simply Basmati Rice that has been par boiled in the husk before 
   milling. It is very popular in India and Nigeria, and widely available in 
   North America. It is essential for making Nigerian Jollof Rice, but must 
   not be used for Jollof Rice in the rest of West Africa. It takes just a 
   little more time time to cook than regular Basmati, and a little more water 
   (2 cups water to 1 cup rice). It is quite tolerant of cooking conditions 
   and the grains remain very separate even if somewhat over cooked. Flavor 
   has a definite hint of brown basmati. The photo specimen grains were 
   typically 0.340 inch long and 0.075 inch wide (8.6 x 1.9 mm) and it cooked 
   out to about 0.55 inch long (14 mm).

   <h3 id="brok">Broken Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_broken01h.jpg" alt="Broken Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Sold mostly to food processors in most of the world, though called for 
   in certain Southeast Asian recipes, broken rice is very popular in West 
   Africa for two reasons - it costs less than full grain rice, and it can 
   substitute for couscous because it is of similar size and shape. The 
   photo was taken in Senegal, a major West African consumer of broken rice.

   <p><h3>Camolino</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Egyptian rice milled 
   with oil - not at all common in North American markets.<p></p>

   <h3>Egyptian Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_riegyp02h.jpg" alt="White Egyprian Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Rice cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt in the 7th century 
   CE. Today, most varieties produced are very high yielding 
   <i>japonica</i> type: Giza 177 (short thick grain), Sakha 
   101/102/103/104 (short thick grain) or Giza 178 (short thin grain). 
   These may be milled as natural polished white rice, white Camolino 
   rice (polished in oil - not common in North American markets), or 
   brown rice (called "cargo rice" by Egyptian manufacturers).


   <p>The thick grain varieties are exported to Turkey, the Levant, Arabia, 
   and Southern California (where we have a large Near Eastern population). 
   The thin grain variety is exported mainly to Eastern and Southeastern 
   Europe, and to East and West Africa.</p>

   <p>The brand I've purchased is "Egypt's Best", a thick grained variety 
   that I found to have very good flavor, moderate stickiness and slightly 
   chewy texture. The specimen grains were typically 0.220 inch long and 
   0.075 inch across (5.6 x 1.9 mm) . A cup of rice took about 2 cups of 
   water and cooked in about 25 minutes to produce 3 cups.
   <br class=cll>

   <h3 id="basmatn">India, non Basmati</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risonam02h.jpg" alt="Sona Masoori White Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
   Africa imports 71% of India's non-basmati rice exports. This sector has 
   been declining because the rupee has increased against the dollar, making 
   Indian exports more expensive than those from Southeast Asia. Also, China 
   has been dumping aging government stocks of medium grain rice into African 
   countries at below market prices. The photo is of Sona Masoori, a popular 
   Indian non-basmati rice.

   <h3>Madagascar Pink</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rimadagp02h.jpg" alt="Pink Madagascar Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Dista Rice]
   <p>
   Grown in the Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar, this unique, lightly 
   aromatic long grain rice is imported by Lotus Foods. It has good 
   yield and is grown on very marshy land, which suggest it is of Indian 
   descent rather than African (trade between India and Madagascar has 
   been going on for many centuries). The photo specimens were 0.295 inch 
   long and 0.070 inch wide (9.0 x 2.1 mm). One cup of rice takes 1-3/4 
   cups of water to make 3 cups cooked.
   <br class=cll></p>
  
   <h3>Mbeya Rice</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/gr_rimbeya02h.jpg" alt="White Embeya Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This rice is grown around the city of Mbeya in the western highlands of 
   Tanzania, and is a much preferred rice in that country. From photos and 
   descriptions of aroma, taste, and texture, I expect this rice is very 
   similar to <a href="ri_afriz.html#jasm"><b>Thai Jasmine</b></a> rice, which will make 
   a good substitute. I have read some recipes by East African writers that 
   recommended Jasmine Rice.

   <h3>Ofada Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_riofada04h.jpg" alt="Ofada Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [often <i>Oryza glaberrima</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> blend]
   <p>
   Ofada Rice is grown only in the southwest corner of Nigeria. Today 
   it is usually a blend of several types, some of which may not be 
   African native. It is considered an elite rice in Nigeria, used mostly 
   for celebrations and other important events. African rice is difficult 
   to mill, so the milling is generally incomplete, adding color and 
   flavor to some of the grains. It is also sometimes fermented, giving 
   it an aromatic flavor, but reputed to smell up the kitchen during 
   cooking. The photo specimens were purchased on-line for 2018 US $4.00 
   / pound. Predominant size was 0.265 x 0.180 inch (6.7 x 4.6 mm).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Upland Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricea01h.jpg" alt="Upland Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [<i>Oryza glaberrima</i>]
   <p>
   These varieties of rice are grown in West and West-Central Africa - a 
   completely different species from Asian rice (<i>Oryza glaberrima</i> 
   rather than <i>Oryza sativa</i>). This rice is almost never seen in  
   North America because it is low yield and not enough is grown to 
   supply Africa. It's main advantage is that it needs far less water 
   than Asian rice. It comes in many varieties from short grain to long 
   grain and from nearly white to very dark brown. Photo from the 
   <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/">USDA ARS GRIN</a> (Germplasm 
   Resources Information Network) is of variety Bankoram from Ghana.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>NERICA Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rinerica01h.jpg" alt="Live NERICA Rice Plants" class=mrg>
   [New Rice for Africa]
   <p>This rice is a forced cross between <i>O. glaberrima</i> and 
   <i>O. sativa</i> to overcome the low yield of <i>O.glaberrina</i> 
   while retaining the dryland growing ability and disease and weed 
   resistance of that species. It is a "forced cross" because the two 
   species are not reproductively compatible. While still in development 
   stages, initial plantings have been successful and cultivation of this 
   rice is spreading in Sub-Saharan Africa. It will not be exported to 
   North America because it is still far from meeting African needs.

   <h3 id="jasm">Thai Jasmine Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rijasm06h.jpg" alt="White Thai Jasmine Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Thai Basmati; Hom Mali (Thai); Milagrosa (Philippines); Cambodia Fragrant; 
   <i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>indica</i>]
   <p>
   Africa imports most of its rice, so Thai Jasmine Rice is making inroads, 
   especially in South Africa and Nigeria. It is imported from Thailand, 
   Vietnam, and Cambodia. Sometimes called "Thai basmati" because of its 
   fragrance, this rice remains fluffy with separate grains (though not quite 
   as fluffy as basmati) and is an ideal rice for many types of dishes. 1 cup 
   rice needs about 1-3/4 cups (variable depending on age) of water to makes 
   about 3 cups cooked rice in 25 minutes. The photo specimens were typically 
   0.300 inches long and 0.075 inches wide (7.6 x 1.9 mm). 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Short Grain Sweet Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risweet01h.jpg" alt="Short Grain Sweet White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   <p>[Sticky Rice; Glutenous Rice; Mochigome (Japan)]</p>
   <p>This intensely white short grain rice is used in Niger and northern 
   Nigeria to make Tuwo Shinkafa, a Fufu of rice. It is very low in amylose 
   and very high in amylopectin starches, so it absorbs a lot of water and 
   cooks up very sticky (but it contains no gluten). The photo 
   specimens, grown in California, by Koda Farms, were 0.200 inches long by 
   0.107 inch wide (5.1 x 2.7 mm). A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/2 cups 
   of water and cooks in about 25 minutes, much longer for Tuwo Shinkafa.
