<h1>American Rice</h1>
<br><img src="img/ri_americ01h.jpg" alt="Historic Rice Facility, Arkansas USA" class=mrg>

<h3>The Americas</h3> are comprised of four distinct regions: North America, 
Central America. South America, and Caribbean. In matters of rice, North 
America and South America dominate, because The United States, Brazil, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay, Argentina, and Peru are significant growers and 
exporters. 

<p>The United States is the 4th largest exporter at $1.9 billion, behind India, 
Thailand, and Pakistan. Brazil, at $506 million, is the 9th largest, behind 
Italy and ahead of Cambodia. Also significant are Uruguay (11th at $468.9 
million) and Paraguay (14th at $295 million). All added together are way 
behind India at $8 billion (32.6% of all exports).</p>

<p>United States rice production is very diverse, with major crops of both 
<i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> varieties, and a broad selection of distinct 
cultivars of each. The United states also has a very wide array of processing 
and preparation methods.<p>

<p>Canada, has no commercial rice production, but is testing <i>japonica</i> 
varieties. Parts of Canada are at similar latitude to Japan, Korea, and 
Northern China, where rice is grown.

<h2 class=lrg id="nar"><u>North America Rice</u></h2>
<br>
<p>The United States has been a major exporter of rice since it was a British 
colony - and was possibly the first country to grow rice specifically for 
export. Carolina Gold rice is thought to have arrived around 1685, and was a 
major export crop well before 1776.</p>
<p>There are two rice growing regions in the United States, The Mississippi / 
Gulf coast, and the northern California Central Valley. The types of rice grown 
in these two regions are very different. In the South, it is long grain 
<i>indica</i> types, and in California is is medium grain <i>japonica</i> 
types. Both regions are major exporters, California primarily to Japan, Korea, 
Taiwan, and Turkey. The southern states export huge amounts to Mexico, and 
about half that much to Haiti. Other significant markets are Canada, South 
and Central Americas, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.

   <h2>American Basmati</h2>
   This title generally refers to either <a href="ri_amerz.html#texm"><b>Texmati</b></a> 
   or <a href="ri_amerz.html#popc"><b>Popcorn Rice</b></a>, both Basmati-Patna hybrids. 
   It can also refer to real Basmati rice grown in the  US by boutique 
   growers, but this is not common.<p></p>

   <h2>American Long Grain</h2>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricarol02h.jpg" alt="American Long Grain White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This rice is what rice is to most Americans. It is a long grain 
   <a href="ri_amerz.html#patna"><b>Patna</b></a> type rice originating from India, 
   This rice is grown mainly in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, and South America. 
   The photo specimens were typically 
   0.295 inch long and 0.070 inch wide (7.5 x 1.8 mm). A cup of rice will 
   take about 1-3/4 cups of water and cook up to 3 cups in about 25 
   minutes.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="cal">California Rice</h2>

<p>Growing rice in California was started by Japanese farmers. Since all 
their lands were illegally seized, they re-established the industry after 
World War II. The focus was always on <i>japonica</i> type rice, the type 
grown in Japan. The climate of the north Central Valley wasn't good for 
<i>Indica</i> anyway.</p> 
<p>California is also a major purveyor to the ever profitable yuppie and 
"health conscious" demographics, so specialty "boutique" rices are grown 
for those market sectors. We list a few of those here.</p>

   <table>
   <tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Botan</h3> - <b>California</b>
   <br>This is a brand of Calrose rice bordering on "sweet rice". It is 
   not that well thought of, particularly for making sushi. Try to get 
   <a href="ri_amerz.html#koku"><b>Kokuho Rose</b></a>, or if you can't find it, some 
   other brand of <a href="ri_amerz.html#crose"><b>Calrose</b></a> for sushi. On the 
   other hand, Cooks Illustrated "America's Test Kitchen" rated Kokuho Rose 
   low, and Botan best for sushi - but, really? Boston? Sushi? Maybe they 
   should stick to Baked Beans.<p></p>

   <h3 id="crose">Calrose</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricalros04h.jpg" alt="Calrose Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Grown in California, Australia, and parts of South America, this is a 
   medium grain rice suitable for sushi and other Japanese, Korean and 
   northern Chinese recipes, or practically anywhere a medium grained rice 
   is required. &nbsp; 
   <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; "Calrose" once meant a specific variety which 
   hasn't been grown since the 1970s - it is now a generic name for 
   several varieties of California type rice. One common brand, Botan, 
   has been widely criticized, particularly for use in sushi. One 
   knowledgeable writer recommends Safeway brand Calrose as much better 
   (date of post unknown), but even more recommends my favorite, 
   <a href="ri_amerz.html#koku"><b>Kokuho Rose</b></a>. For details see our 
   <a href="gr_ricaljapz.html"><b>California / Japanese Rice</b></a> 
   page.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="koku">Kokuho Rose</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rikokuho02h.jpg" alt="Kokuho Rose Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   A Japanese style medium grain rice developed by Koda Farms of 
   South Dos Palos, California. I definitely prefer this rice to 
   <a href="ri_amerz.html#crose"><b>Calrose</b></a> varieties. The photo specimens 
   were typically 0.230 inch long and 0.105 inch wide (5.8 x 2.6 mm).
   For details see our <a href="gr_ricaljapz.html"><b>California / 
   Japanese Rice</b></a> page.

   <p>Note that in Los Angeles, Korean markets carry all the Japanese 
   ingredients you might need, because Japanese markets are pretty much 
   extinct here - the Japanese have been assimilated. Little Tokyo is 
   now mostly Korean owned, as are most of the sushi bars.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Mochi Rice</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This is a 
   non-specific term for Japanese sweet rice that is used to make Mochi 
   dough, much used for sweets and deserts. It is of the Short Grain 
   Sweet variety.<p></p>

   <h3>Sushi Rice</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This is not a type of rice, but a 
   medium grain rice seasoned with rice vinegar. Quite a few sources say 
   it is short grain / sweet rice. This is wrong - sweet rice makes very 
   inferior sushi. In California, sushi rice will be Calrose, or preferably 
   Kokuhu Rose. Nishiki brand is also favored for sushi. Note that one brand 
   of Calrose, Botan, has been flagged as inferior for sushi. For details see 
   our <a href="gr_ricaljapz.html"><b>California / Japanese Rice</b></a> 
   page.<p></p>

   <h3>Short Grain Sweet</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risweet01h.jpg" alt="Short Grain Sweet White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Glutenous Rice] &nbsp; 
   <p>This intensely white short grain rice is the 
   standard type for sweet rice. Sweet rice is no sweeter than any other 
   kind, but gets the name from being used mainly to make sweets and 
   deserts. The photo specimens, grown in California, by Koda Farms, were 
   0.200 inches long by 0.107 inch wide (5.1 x 2.7 mm). A cup of this 
   rice needs about 2-1/2 cups of water and cooks in about 25 minutes.
   Note that for Loatian and Issan Thai cooking, the sweet rice to use 
   is Thai Long Grain Sweet Rice, which is quited different.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>California Botique Rice</h2>
   <p>
   These are rices grown organically by the Lundberg family and a few others, 
   tuned for the yuppie and "health conscious" markets. These can be found 
   in Whole Foods Market and similar up-market outlets, and in some large 
   multi-ethnic markets here in Los Angeles. Lundberg has a lot more 
   overpriced rices, but the two listed here seem to be their flagship 
   products.<p></p>

   <table>
   <tr><td class=in2></td><td>   

      <h3>Black Japonica</h3><small>&reg;</small>
      <br><img src="img/gr_riblkjap02h.jpg" alt="Grains of Rice" class=mrg>
      <b>Lundberg</b> - This is actually a dark brown and a very dark brown, 
      almost black rice variety planted together and harvested together. The 
      photo specimens were typically 0.240 inch long and 0.100 inch wide 
      (7.3 x 3.0 mm). A cup of this rice needs 2 cups of water and 50 
      minutes cooking time. Lundberg sells this for 2021 US $4.99 / pound. 
      <br class=cll><p></p>
   
      <h3>Red Rice - Formerly "Wehani"</h3><small>&reg;</small>
      <br><img src="img/gr_riwehan02h.jpg" alt="Wehani Rice Grains" class=mrg>
      <p><b>Lundberg</b> - A long grain aromatic rice developed primarily 
      from basmati (though it doesn't look much like brown basmati) by the 
      Lundberg Family in California. It has a deep reddish brown color, and 
      when cooked has an aroma suggestive of hot buttered peanuts. The grains 
      tend to split open lengthwise when cooked, much like wild rice does. 
      The photo specimens were typically 0.295 inch long and 0.112 inch 
      wide (7.5 x 2.9 mm). To cook, use 2-1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil 
      uncovered, then cover tightly and set the burner to just a simmer for 
      an hour. It'll still be a bit chewy, but nothing you can't manage. 
      Lundberg sells this for 2021 US $4.99 / pound. Other vendors are still 
      selling the Lundberg product under the name "Wehani". 
      <br class=cll><p></p> 

      <h3>Colusari</h3><small>&reg;</small> 
      <br><img src="img/gr_ricolus02h.jpg" alt="Colusari Rice Grains" class=mrg>
      <b>Kalustyan's</b> - This is a very deep Burgundy red rice grown in 
      the Sacramento Valley of California. This rice is very highly regarded 
      by high priced gourmet chefs - it posesses the two qualities that define 
      "gourmet" - hard to find and absurdly expensive. When I acquired it in 
      2014 it was sold exclusively by Indian Harvest, for 2014 US $25.96 / 
      pound. Today it is sold by Klustyan's for 2021 US $9.99 / pound - except 
      they don't have any (9 2021).
      <p>I bought an 8oz bag from Indian Harvest 
      2014. A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/3 cups of water to make 3 cups 
      in about 45 minutes. An 8 ounce package is about 1-1/3 cups, which the 
      package says will make 6 serving - rather scant servings in my opinion 
      - but it's a "gourmet" item. Fancy chefs can serve one tablespoon of it 
      on an otherwise vacant white plate, artfully garnished with a single 
      sprig of parsley, and charge plenty.</p>

<h2 id="carol">Carolina Gold / Charleston Gold</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_richarl02h.jpg" alt="Grains of Charleston White Rice" class=mrg>
<p>"Charleston Gold" is a restoration of the famous Carolina Gold Rice, now 
again grown in South Carolina by Carolina Plantation. The "Gold" comes from 
the appearance of rippening seed heads in the fields. Seeds were obtained from 
a seed bank, and carefully nurtuted into a crop. Subsequently, selective 
breeding of the Carolina Rice was applied to improve yield and flavor, 
producing the "Charleston Gold" rice variety. The photo specimens of intact 
grains were typically 0.280 inch long and 0.07 inch wide (7.1 x 1.8 mm). 
Current production has a lot of broken grains - possibly it is soft and 
difficult to mill, or possibly to emulate hand pounding, as was done by 
slaves.</p>

<p><u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; "Carolina Rice" and "Carolina Gold" (for their 
par boiled version) are trademarks owned by Riviana Foods, a Texas-based 
rice brand owner. Rice under these trademarks is an undistinguished long 
grain Texas rice <u>unrelated by type, taste, appearance, or otherwise</u> 
to the real Carolina Gold. The trademarks are probably the reason the real 
thing is now sold as "Charleston Gold".</p>

<p>This is a long grain type rice genetically from southern India or 
Indonesia, though it may have come from plantings in Madagascar. It was 
formerly a major export crop in South Carolina, from where much was sent to 
England in colonial days, then re-exported to Holland, Germany and France. 
After the American Revolution shipments no longer cleared through England but 
went direct.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the growing methods used in South Carolina were heavily 
dependent on "Them happy darkies out thar work'n the fields an sing'n they 
songs. Den Damn Yankees come on down an' force'n the darkies to work for 
pay". Slaves from West Africa taught Carolina how to grow rice in swampy 
areas, but their health suffered badly from the swampy conditions. With no 
slaves available after the Civil War, the crop went into decline and 
disappeared. The last commercial crop was in 1927. Carolina Plantation is 
not allowed to use slave labor, so how can they claim their rice is 
"authentic"?
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="popc">Popcorn Rice</h2>
<br><img src="img/ri_popcn02h.jpg" alt="Popcorn Rice Grains" class=mrg>
A hybrid of basmati and Patna type rice grown in Louisiana and Texas, 
this aromatic long grain rice, when cooked, has an aroma suggestive of 
popcorn, thus the name. It lacks any true basmati character.  This is a 
rather small grain rice, the photo specimens being 0.275 inch long by 
0.065 inch wide (7.0 x 1.7 mm). A cup of this rice needs 1-3/4 cups of water 
and cooks in 25 minutes.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="texm">Texmati / American Basmati</h2>
<br><img src="img/ri_texmati02h.jpg" alt="American Long Grain White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
<p>This is a hybrid of Basmati and Patna type rice, developed by RiceTec. It is 
sold under the brand RiceSelect which was formerly owned by RiceTec. It lacks 
any true Basmati characteristics, yet RiceTec tried to patent the name 
Basmati for it. Note that the milling is incomplete, resulting in more flavor 
than plain white rice. Photo specimes were 0.280 inch long by 0.085 inch width 
(7.1 x 2.2 mm). A cup of this rice needs 1-3/4 cups of water and cooks in 
25 minutes.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Upland Rice</h2>
<br><img src="img/ri_upland05h.jpg" alt="Upland Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
Thomas Jefferson became a proponent of upland rice when he noted the very 
high amount of sickness paddy rice production was causing slaves. The 
upland rice he acquired was an African variety.
<p>Today, a number of upland rice varieties are grown in North America, 
but not commercially. They are grown by small farmers or hobbyists for 
their own use. They may be African <i>glaberrima</i> or Asian <i>indica</i> 
varieties.

<h2>Wild Pecan Rice</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_riwildpk02h.jpg" alt="Wild Pecan Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
Not wild and no pecans - it's a hybrid long grain rice that owes most 
of it's character to incomplete milling. While not a brown rice, it still 
has a fair amount of bran left, giving it a nutty taste and aroma. The 
aroma and taste reminded the developer of the wild pecans that grew in the 
area, thus the name. The photo specimens were 0.290 inch long and 0.075 inch 
wide (7.4 x 1.9 mm). This rice is available on-line in 10 pound bags for 
about 2021 US $4.35 / pound, or 2 pound bags at $7.70 / pound, vs. regular 
long grain white at $1.00 / pound. Of course you can pay a lot more in 
the tiny decorative boxes in the markets.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2 id="wild">Wild Rice - American:</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_riwild01h.jpg" alt="American Wild Rice Grains" class=mrg>
[<i>Zizania palustris</i>, <i>Zizania aquatica</i>]
<p>
This is the seed of a marsh grass native to North America (there is also 
a species (<i>Z. latifolia</i>) that grows in Manchuria). Traditionally 
it was harvested by Americans Indians, particularly in the Great Lakes 
region of the US and Canada, who thrashed it into canoes. It took several 
passes through the marsh because the seed heads ripened unevenly and grains 
dropped as soon as they were ripe (shattered). It sold at such high prices 
it was usually cut 4 to 1 with regular rice when used, and served only at 
special dinners, like Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Recently, plant geneticists developed a non-shattering variety suitable 
for single pass harvesting and growing in commercial paddies - and the 
natives are not happy. California and Minnesota now provide the bulk of 
wild rice production from farming. Though the natural varieties are still 
considered superior in flavor and texture they no longer fetch so high a 
price. There is also now some production in Australia and Hungary. The 
photo specimens are of paddy grown grains. Size varies widely with the 
largest grains about 0.480 inch long and 0.075 inch wide (12.2 x 1.9 mm). 
Like regular rice, wild rice has no gluten and is safe for celiacs.

<h2 class=lrg id="car"><u>Central American Rice</u></h2>

<p>Geographers consider Mexico part of North America, but in culinary terms 
it is much closer to Central America, so here we consider it with other 
Central American countries,  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.</p> 

<p>All the countries of Central America, Mexico included, grow some rice. 
Both paddy and upland cultures are used. None of these countries are at all 
self sufficient, so all are rice importers, mostly from the United States 
and Brazil, but some from Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Mexico is by far the 
largest export destination for the United states, at over 850,000 metric tons 
per year. Honduras and Nicaragua are also significant US export destinations, 
importing about 291,000 metric tons between them. Nicaragua and Costa Rica 
also import significant amounts of rice from Brazil</p>

<p>Nearly all the rice exported to these countries is long grain white 
<i>indica</i> rice, which is most accepted in their cuisines. Some Calrose 
type may also be exported to the region.</p> 

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="carr"><u>Caribbean Rice</u></h2>
<p>Pretty much all rice production in the Caribban is of <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr">
<b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> type rice, as that is the kind that grows 
well in the tropics, and is the preferences of the Caribbean cuisines, but 
medium grain rice like Calrose is used to make rice piuddings and a few other 
dishes.</p>

<p>While all the Caribbean countries produce some rice, most of them are not self 
sufficient, so imported rice is important. Sources of this rice are various, 
but Brazil and Guyana are major suppliers.</p>

<h2>Haiti</h2> was self sufficient in rice until the early 1980s, when 
U.S. government subsidized imports made growing rice unprofitable in Haiti. 
Today, Haiti is the second largest export market for United States rice, at 
over 451 thousand metric tons, and very little is grown domestically. U.S. 
rice growers have benefitted substantially from the subsidies.<p></p> 

<h2>Dominican Republic</h2> is considered self sufficient in rice. It 
exports about 10,000 Metric Tons and imports about 30,000 Metric Tons.<p></p>

<h2>Trinadad and Tobago</h2> used to produce as much as 20,000 metric tons of 
rice, but that has dwindled to 1,000 tons, apparently due to government 
mismanagement - like not paying the farmers in time for them to avoid 
bankruptcy. Imports are now around 33,000 tons.<p></p>

<h2>Cuba</h2> is in a bad way regarding rice. Domestic production has declined 
due to lack of equipment, fertilizers, pestcides, and from general politics. 
Even at its best Cuba's rice imports were very high, and, before the embargos, 
Cuba was the largest export market for U.S. rice. Rice imports are a problem 
due to a severe shortage of hard currency. Cuba's main export crop, sugar 
cane, is not paying the bills.<p></p>

<h2>Jamaica</h2> produces almost no rice, and even government increase plans 
of 2010 tageted only 15% domestic by 2015. They failed to get anywhere near 
that. Imports are more than 100,000 metric tons, 75% from Guyana and Suriname. 
They are committed to buy 60,000 metric tons from Guyana, but that country 
can't always ship that much, so some comes from the United States and Southeast 
Asia to fill the gap.<p></p>

<h2>Puerto Rico</h2>, a United States Territory, restarted rice cultivation 
in 2016, when domestic rice became available for the first time in 30 years. 
Now, though, (2021) China is dumping a lot of older medium grain rice to 
Puerto Rico from government stores at below market prices. This is certain 
to impact domestic rice production.<p></p>

<p><br></p>



<h2 class=lrg id="sar"><u>South American Rice</u></h2>
<br>
<br>South America is a very rice dependent region. Predominantly long grain 
<i>indica</i> rice is grown, but significant amounts of Calrose type rice are 
grown locally and imported from California. This type of rice is particularly 
important for properly making the ever popular Pollo con Arroz (Chicken with 
Rice) which is related to Spanish paella, always made with <i>japonica</i> 
rice.<p></p>

<h3 id="lgr">Long Grain Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricarol02h.jpg" alt="Grains of American Long Grain White Rice" class=mrg>
   Long Grain <a href="ri_amerz.html#patna"><b>Patna</b></a> (<i>indica</i>) paddy grown 
   rice is the dominant type in most of South America, though some countries 
   also grow a fair amount of Upland Rice. Brazil dominates production of 
   this kind of rice (but also Upland Rice).
   This rice is grown in vast quantity in the most southern states of Brazil 
   (Santa Catarina  and Rio Grande do Sul) where production is highly 
   mechanized for planting (direct seeding) and harvest. Composition of 
   production is about 35% broken rice (used by food processors), 35% 
   parboiled and brown rice, and 30% white polished rice. The photo specimens 
   were typically 0.295 inch long and 0.070 inch wide (7.5 x 1.8 mm). A cup of 
   rice will take about 1-3/4 cups of water and cook up to 3 cups in about 
   25 minutes.

<h3>Tio Jo&atilde;</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_tiajoa02h.jpg" alt="Tio Joao Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   <p>This is actually a brand rather than a type, but this brand of white 
   long grain rice is extremely popular in Brazil for the traditional Beans 
   &amp; Rice. It is grown in Brazil and some is exported to the United 
   States. The photo specimens were 0.330 inch long and 0.080 inch 
   wide (8.4 x 2.0 mm). One cup of rice takes 1-3/4 cups of water to make 3 
   cups cooked in about 25 minutes.
   <br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="calr">Medium Grain <i>japonica</i></h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricalros04h.jpg" alt="Calrose Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Some Calrose type rice may be imported from California or grown locally. 
   A short or medium grain <i>japonica</i> rice is needed to authentically 
   reproduce some Portuguese dishes, particularly thick soups, and Pollo con 
   Arroz, a very popular dish in Spanish speaking regions of South America
   <br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="upl">Upland Rice</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/ri_upland04h.jpg" alt="Bolivian Rice Farmer with Upland Rice" class=mrg>
   [<i>Oryza sativa</i>]
   <p>The Upland Rice grown in Latin America is not the African kind, but 
   was probably brought from Southeast Asia, where a great deal of upland 
   rice is grown. Latin American upland rices are most closely related to 
   var <i>japonica</i> but with some influence from var <i>javonica</i>. 
   Brazil produces far and away more upland rice than the rest of Latin 
   America combined, but it also very important in Bolivia and significant 
   in Peru, Columbia, and Venezuela. Upland rice production has been 
   declining, because of the heavy concentration on improving paddy rice, 
   but recently research has shifted to improving Upland Rice. Upland rice 
   is particularly important to rural small holders.

   [<i>Oryza glumaepatula</i>, <i>Oryza latifolia</i>, <i>Oryza (unnamed)</i> 
   (cultivated)]
   <p>These wild rice species are native to the Amazon drainage and the 
   indigenous peoples of the region cultivated these types. Apparently 
   cultivation has long ended, because there is no species name for a 
   domesticated rice of this type. About 1.2% of Brazil's rice production 
   is "V&aacute;zea" Rice. V&aacute;zea is a flooded forrest. I have not 
   found if any of this rice is of the native species. The photo is of 
   <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> from Asia. <i>Oryza glumaepatula</i> was long 
   considered to be identical to the Asian wild rice, but molecular 
   genetics found some differences.

<h2>Argentina</h2> produces significant amounts of rice, about 830 million 
tons and exports a fair amount of it. This is about 95% <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr">
<b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> type rice, and the rest is 
<a href="ri_amerz.html#calr"><b>Medium Grain</b></a>. All is grown in the north adjacent 
to Paraguay and Uruguay, and production is highly mechanized. About 60% 
is exported, as Argentines eat mostly beef and bread.<p></p>

<h2>Bolivia</h2> produces nearly 400,000 metric tons of rice, nearly all of 
which is <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>. Bolivia is generally 
self-sufficient in rice, importing some years and exporting other years. 
Exports are difficult because Upland Rice is not considered high quality 
by most importers. Much effort is being put into improving yields and 
quality of Upland Rice.<p></p>

<h2>Brazil</h2> produces by far the most rice of any country in South America, 
and now is the 6th largest exporter of rice worldwide. It's major destinations 
are Venezuela, Senegal, Peru, Gambia, Sierra Leone, United States and Costa 
Rica. Brazil imports rice from Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. These 
providers are adjacent to the southern tip of Brazil, it's main rice growing 
region. Brazil exports primarily <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> 
<i>indica</i> rice. Most rice grown elswhere in Brazil is for domestic 
consumption, and the majority of it is <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h2>Chile</h2>, a low rice consumption country, produces about 174,000 metric 
tons of paddy rice, which is about 110,000 metric tons of milled rice. 
Consumption is 231,000 metric tons of milled rice. The balance must be 
imported, from Argentina (35%), Paraguay (25%), and Uruguay (13%). That 
imported is mostly <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> rice, 
but all rice production in Chili is <a href="ri_amerz.html#calr"><b>Medium Grain 
<i>japonica</i></b></a>, as the rice growing region is too far south for 
<i>indica</i>.<p></p>

<h2>Colombia</h2> produces about 1.8 million tons of rice per year, more than 
all other South American countries except Brazil and Peru.most of 
which is <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> rice. About 1/4 
of production is <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a> for domestic 
consumption. Global warming is a serious threat to the rice industry in 
Colombia.<p></p>

<h2>Ecuador</h2> produces about 930,000 metric tons of rice, most of which 
is <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> rice. Some rice is 
imported from the United States, though with high tarrifs. One Equadorian 
recipe writer talked about how pleased she was with switching from Long 
Grain rice to Calrose. About 20% of Ecuadorian rice production is 
<a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Guyana</h2> is on the South American continent, but generally considered 
part of the Caribbean economic sphere. It produces about 1 million metric 
tons of rice per year. Most is <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> 
<i>indica</i> rice, but around 20% is <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>. 
Exports of rice are very important to Guyana's economy and total about 
520,000 metric tons, or over half of production. The major export market 
is Venezuela, but Jamaica is committed to buy 60,000 tons. Some goes to 
Trinidad and Tobago where rice production has dropped to almost none.<p></p> 

<h2>Peru</h2> produces about 2.2 million metric tons of rice per year. In 
many years it exports little or no rice and imports to fill shortfall, but 
in 2019 it exported 74,678 metric tons and 91,020metric tons in 2020. Exports 
are primarily <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> rice, which 
is also the rice preferred by the elite in Peru. <a href="ri_amerz.html#calr">
<b>Medium Grain</b></a> rice, including <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a> 
is preferred by the general population. About 20% of Peruvian rice production 
is <a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Suriname</h2> is on the South American continent, but generally considered 
part of the Caribbean economic sphere. Its rice production is about 275,000 
metric tons, pretty much all <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr"><b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> 
rice. Around 110,000 metric tons are exported, about 56% as cargo rice 
(unmilled), 39% milled white rice, and 4% parboiled rice. The largest export 
is to Jamaica (62%), but some also to Trinidad and Tobogo, where rice 
production has dropped to almost nothing. Some (12%) goes to Europe and some 
to North America (14%).<p></p>

<h2>Venezuela</h2> is a net importing country, primarily from Brazil. Domestic 
production is about 760,000 metric tons, predominantly <a href="ri_amerz.html#lgr">
<b>Long Grain</b></a> <i>indica</i> rice, but also a fair amount of 
<a href="ri_amerz.html#upl"><b>Upland Rice</b></a>.<p></p>
