<h1 class=s>European Rice</h1>
<br><img src="img/ri_europ01h.jpg" alt="Carnaroli Rice" class=mrg>
[<i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>japonica</i>]
<p>The best known European rices are from Portugal, Spain and Italy. 
France, Greece and the Balkans produce a very small amount of rice for 
local consumption.</p>

<p>All significant rice production in Europe is short to medium grain 
high amylopectin <i>japonica</i>, both due to cool climate and the popular 
methods by which rice is cooked in the region. The rices produced are very 
specific to regional cooking methods and are imperfectly interchangeable.
These cooking methods have been adopted by people in North America, and 
the correct rice for each should be selected for good results.

<h2 class=lrg>Portugal</h2>
<p>Portuguese rice dishes unlike the Spanish or Italian, tend to be soupy, with 
plenty of liquid. The Portuguese also like their rice creamy, not "al dente". 
Traditionalists in Portugal are upset that Carolino rice has been so supplanted 
by Agulha rice, and outraged that some restaurants are making traditional 
dishes with parboiled rice - not suitable, but more difficult to screw up in 
a restaurant kitchen. 
</p>

   <h3>Carolino Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_carol02h.jpg" alt="Portuguese Carolino Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   The traditional rice in Portugal is Carolino, a medium grain <i>japonica</i> 
   type rice. "Ar&iacute;ete" and "Euro" are current cultivars. In recent 
   times Agulha, a long grain rice has largely displaced it, even though Agulha 
   is not as suitable for the Portuguese style of rice cooking. Some cooks are 
   even using parboiled rice, which doesn't work at all well. Effort is 
   ongoing to restore Carolino rice to popularity and to improve Portugal's 
   rice cuisine. The photo specimens were 0.275 inch long and 0.095 inch 
   wide (7.0 x 2.4 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p> 

   <h3>Agulha rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_agulha02h.jpg" alt="Portuguese Agulha Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   This long grain "needle rice" is currently the most common Portuguese grown 
   rice, and often used where it shouldn't be. The photo specimens were 0.285
   inch long and 0.075 inch wide (7.2 x 1.9 mm). One cup of this rice needs 
   1-3/4 cups of water and cooks in 25 minutes.

<h2 class=lrg>Spain</h2>

<p>Spain, through which rice entered Europe, cooks it rather differently 
from any other place in the world. <i>Paella</i> is named for the pan it 
is cooked in, a shallow uncovered pan. This requires a super absorbent 
rice, so most rice simply will not do. If Spanish rice is not available, 
a risotto rice like <a href="ri_euroz.html#carna"><b>Carnaroli</b></a> can be used 
(risotto is of Spanish origin), but the results are not quite the 
same.</p>

<p>The Spanish also cook <i>Arroz</i>, which is the same kind of rice 
cooked in a <i>cazuela</i>, either in the oven or on the stove top. 
Arroz may be dry or very moist. Paella is always dry, in other words, 
all the liquid is absorbed by the rice.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3>Bomba</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribomba02h.jpg" alt="White Bomba Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is considered the best rice for paella. It is relatively expensive 
   and the package will always advertise Bomba if that's what is in it.
   This rice is grown in Murcia and Valencia.  One desirable feature of 
   Bomba is that it is not as easily ruined by overcooking as other 
   varieties. The normal recommendation for paella is there should be 
   twice as much broth as rice, but with bomba you may need just a touch 
   more as it is very absorbent. The grains are tiny, with the photo 
   specimens typically measuring 0.190 inch long and 0.115 inch wide. 
   Grown in Valencia, 2014 US $5.99 per 1/2 kilo (1.1 pounds). 
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Valencia</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rivalen02h.jpg" alt="White Valencia Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Valencia is the main rice growing region of Spain. Valencia rice is 
   considered excellent rice for paella. If the package is labeled 
   "Valencia" it may contain Arroz Fonsa, Gleva, Bahia, or Senia, but 
   not Bomba, unless Bomba is specified on the label. The general 
   recommendation for paella is twice as much broth as rice. The photo 
   specimens were typically 0.233 inch long and 0.129 inch wide. 2014 
   US $3.79 per kilo (2.2 pounds). 
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Calasparra</h3> 
   <br>This rice, grown in Murcia, is suitable for paella, but is also 
   liked for <i>arroz</i> cooked in <i>cazuela</i> because it is more 
   resistant to overcooking than most varieties.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Delta del Ebro</h3> 
   <br>A rice suitable for paella grown in Tarragona.

<h2 class=lrg>Italy</h2>

<p>The risotto rice category includes a number of Italian varieties, all 
medium grain, that absorb a lot of water and develop a creamy outside, 
but with a moderately firm core. Do not rinse rice for risotto, the 
starch on the outside becomes part of the texture. The three varieties 
considered best are Carnaroli, Maratelli and Vialone Nano. The Italians 
do use some rice other than risotto varieties, but not a lot.</p>

<p>Risotto is cooked quite differently from most rice dishes. The rice 
is first fried very lightly in oil or butter. usually mixed with onions 
and other ingredients. It is then cooked with a lot of stirring, with 
broth stirred in only as needed - always half the remaining amount until 
the last 1/4 cup.</p>

<p><b>Risotto Rice Designations</b> &nbsp; These are Comune, Semifino, 
Fino and Superfino. These designations have no relationship to quality, 
they are calculated from the length to width ratio of the grains.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>

   <h3 id="arbor">Arborio</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_riarbor02h.jpg" alt="White Arboriao Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is a superfino risotto rice, the best known risotto rice outside 
   Italy, but within Italy it has been displaced by others. It takes 
   longer to cook than the more popular rice, absorbs less water and 
   is very cranky, going from under cooked to over cooked "in the blink 
   of an eye". It is considered unsuitable for restaurant service. The 
   photo specimens, from Italy, were 0.275 inch long and 0.128 inch wide 
   (8.4 x 3.9 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Baldo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribaldo02h.jpg" alt="White Baldo Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is an Italian, medium grain rice developed from Arborio crossed 
   with Stirpe 136 rice and now popular in most Mediterranean countries. 
   It is particularly favored by restaurants because it holds up better 
   than Arborio to the practice of partially cooking and then chilling 
   risottos,  to be finish cooked to customer's orders. The photo 
   specimens, grown in Turkey, were typically 0.285 inch long by 0.122 
   inch wide (7.2 x 3.1 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="carna">Carnaroli</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricarn02h.jpg" alt="White Carnaroli Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   Grown in a small region of northern Italy between Milan and Turin, 
   Carnaroli is perhaps the most prestigious Italian risotto rice and is 
   generally reserved for the most refined dishes. Compared to arborio the 
   grains are larger and while they become exceptionally creamy on the 
   outside they hold their shape at the core, due to a higher amount 
   of amylose starch in the center, making for a better texture. The 
   photo specimens, grown in Argentina, were typically 0.260 inch long 
   and 0.130 inch wide (6.6 x 3.3 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Vialone Nano</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rivnano02h.jpg" alt="White Vialone Nano Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This semi-fino rice is one of the most favored risotto rice varieties, 
   especially in the region around Venice. The photo specimens, from 
   Italy, were typically 0.230 inch long and 0.135 inch wide 
   (6.6 x 3.3).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Other Risotto Rice Varieties</h3>
   <ul>
   <li><b>Maratelli</b> &nbsp;  This is an early ripening variety with 
     heavy yield. It is somewhat higher in amylose starch than other 
     risotto rice so the grains (similar to Carnaroli) stay a bit more 
     separate in risottos.</li>
   <li><b>Padano</b></li>
   <li><b>Piedmont Rice</b> &nbsp; another name for Risotto Rice.</li>
   <li><b>Roma</b></li>
   </ul>

   <h3 id="nero">Nero Venere</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/gr_rivenere02h.jpg" alt="Black Nero Venere Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is not a risotto rice, but has become popular as a color contrast, 
   particularly served with green vegetables. This medium grain rice is 
   grown in the Padana Delta of the Po River in northern Italy, just a bit 
   south of Venice. It was developed as a hybrid of the 
   <a href="ri_chinz.html#chinab"><b>China Black</b></a> rice. Hybridization 
   was necessary because the original China Black rice could not withstand 
   the colder winters of the Po Valley, but the result is very much like 
   the Chinese parent. The photo specimens, purchased from a local Italian 
   market in Los Angeles, were typically 0.235 inches long by 0.107 inch 
   wide (6.0 x 2.7 mm). A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/4 cups of water 
   and about 55 minutes of cooking to make about 3 cups. The grains remain 
   quite firm and very separate, with a pleasant flavor and deep color.
