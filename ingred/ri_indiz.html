<p>Though the first surviving evidence or rice cultivation is from China, 
rice itself, and its cultivation, may have originated in India or Southeast 
Asia. It has been cultivated far too long to know for sure. India does have 
a wider variety of rice under cultivation than other parts of Asia. Rice grown 
in Pakistan is similar to that grown in northern India. Some unique varieties 
are grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. Completely different varieties 
are grown in the far eastern and southern reaches of India. Varieties grown 
in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) are very similar to those grown in the southeastern 
Indian state of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>General Information on <a href="gr_rice.html"><b>Rice</b></a>, and Rice 
of other regions.

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>
<p></p>

<p>In India, due to the cost of cooking fuel, pressure cookers are very 
popular, and rice is often cooked in a pressure cooker, but cooking times 
on this page are for Rice Cooker or Stovetop Absorption Method. Measures are 
in Standard American cups (8 oz / 237 ml) not in Japanese Rice Cooker cups 
(180 ml / 6 oz).

<h2 class=lrg id="var"><u>Rice Cultivars</u></h2>
<p></p>

   <h3 id="basmat">Basmati</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribasm06h.jpg" alt="Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
   Grown in northern India and Pakistan, in the foothills of the Himalayas, 
   the "Queen of Fragrance" is a long grain distinctly aromatic rice that 
   stands up well to robust flavors. The grains are very long and properly 
   cooked stay very separate and fluffy. A number of varieties are 
   imported from India and Pakistan, so adjustment of the amount of water 
   may be needed one to another. Typically 1 cup of rice takes 1-7/8 cups 
   of water and makes 3 cups. The photo specimens were typically 0.290 
   inch long by 0.060 inch wide (7.4 x 1.5 mm). The grains expand greatly 
   in length when cooked. The photo specimens cooked out to about 1/2 
   inch long (13 mm).

   <p><b>Basmati Aged</b> is preferred to new because the grains stay even 
   more separate. It is aged before milling. A prime grade 50 year old 
   basmati can sell at over $100/pound to connoisseurs, but most is aged 
   just a year or two and is very affordable in North America, though 
   considered expensive in India. Japanese and Koreans do not like 
   basmati rice one bit, aged or not.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Basmati Sella</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribassel03h.jpg" alt="Sella Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   This is simply Basmati Rice that has been par boiled in the husk before 
   milling. It is very popular in India and Nigeria, and widely available in 
   North America. It takes just a little more time time to cook than regular 
   Basmati, and a little more water (2 cups water to 1 cup rice). It is quite 
   tolerant of cooking conditions and the grains remain very separate even 
   if somewhat over cooked. Flavor has a definite hint of brown basmati. The 
   photo specimen grains were typically 0.340 inch long and 0.075 inch wide 
   (8.6 x 1.9 mm) and it cooked out to about 0.55 inch long (14 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>
   
   <h3>Basmati Brown</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribasmb06h.jpg" alt="Brown Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
   This rice doesn't seem to be much used in India, but it is exported to 
   North America where it is definitely used. The photo specimens were 
   typically 0.290 inch long by 0.060 inch wide (7.4 x 1.5 mm). This rice 
   takes more water and longer cooking than the white. For a cup of rice use 
   2 cups of water and cook for 50 minutes, then let rest 5 minutes before 
   lifting the cover.
   <br class=cll><p></p>
    

<h3 id="beat">Beaten Rice / Poha</h3>
<br><img src="img/gr_riflake04h.jpg" alt="White Rice Flakes" class=mrg>
[Rice Flakes, Pounded Rice; Poha (India); Choora (India, Northeast); 
  Chira (Assam)]
<p>This product is popular in India. The grains are cooked, flattened into 
flakes and dried, making a product that cooks very quickly - an attractive 
feature in a region where cooking fuel is extremely expensive. It is usually 
given a quick rinse, drained well, and let sit for a few minutes to absorb 
water that adheres to it.
<br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Bhutan Red</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ribhut02h.jpg" alt="Bhutan Red Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   [Himalayan Red Rice - Short Grain]
   <p>
   This is the staple rice of Bhutan in the Himalayas. It is a medium grain 
   rice sold "brown" with the reddish brown bran layers still on. It cooks a 
   little more quickly than other brown rice varieties, about 25 minutes 
   with 1-3/4 cups of water. The photo specimen grains were typically 0.225 
   inch long and 0.100 inch wide (5.7 x 2.5 mm).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="goa">Goa Red Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rigoa01h.jpg" alt="Goa Red Rice, cooked" class=mrg>   
   [Ukade rice] &nbsp; This is a par boiled rice, boiled in the husk, then 
   dried and milled. It is not easily available in North America. I find 
   appearance and descriptions very like <a href="ri_indiz.html#rmatt"><b>Rose Matta</b></a> 
   which is grown down the coast in Karala. The photo specimen is cooked, so 
   it is much lighter in color than our photo of Rose Matta, but both cooked, 
   they look very much  the same.

   <h3>Himalayan Red</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_himalr02h.jpg" alt="Himalayan Red Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Himalayan Red Rice - Long Grain] 
   <p>Despite it's high price (2021 US $17 to $25 / pound) it will not be grown 
   in the Himalayas, but the word "Himalayan" has great cachet with the 
   "health concious", justifying the price. It will actually be grown 
   somewhere in India or Thailand - thus actually "Humalayan Type". It does 
   not share the quick cooking of the Bhutan Red. In my tests it needed about 
   4 cups of water to a cup of rice and 2 hours to cook, and it still had 
   stiff spots.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="idli">Idli Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_riidli03h.jpg" alt="Idli Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   A very tiny medium grain rice used in southern India to make small steamed 
   cakes called Idli, and lacy crepe like pancakes called Dosa. The photo 
   specimens were typically 0.190 inch long and 0.090 inch wide (4.8 x 2.3 mm). 
   This rice is usually parboiled but sometimes not, and some people use 
   most parboiled and some not, especially for Dosa. You can cook this rice 
   normally, but use a little shorter time due to the small grains, and 
   perhaps just a touch less if it's parboiled. This rice is generally 
   not cooked normally.
   <p>Idli rice is usually soaked for 6 hours or more, ground to paste 
   in a wet grinder, and combined 3:1 with similarly ground urad dal 
   and other ingredients, fermented at least overnight (depending on 
   the climate) and then steamed in a special idli steamer. The batter 
   is made a little thinner for Dosa, which are pan fried. <b>Subst</b>: 
   substitution is risky. The rice needs to be parboiled and have an 
   amylopectin content of 80% or higher. Long grain rice is 78% or less 
   and won't work.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>IR-20 Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_ir20-02h.jpg" alt="IR-20 Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is a new variety highly though of for making idli and dosa. This 
   rice is sold in parboiled form, and its usage is precisely the same 
   as <a href="ri_indiz.html#idli"><b>Idli Rice</b></a>. The photo specimens were 0.27 
   inch long and 0.07 wide (6.9 x 1.8 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3 id="jasm">Thai Jasmine Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rijasm06h.jpg" alt="White Thai Jasmine Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Thai Basmati; Hom Mali (Thai); Milagrosa (Philippines); Cambodia Fragrant; 
   <i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>Indica</i>]
   <p>
   This long grain and distinctly aromatic rice from Thailand has penetrated 
   the Indian market, as it has everywhere else. India brands, like "Pride of 
   India" import it from Thailand, but much is grown in Vietnam, and Cambodia 
   is also a significatnt exporter. This rice is 15% to 18% amylose.</p>
   <p>Sometimes called "Thai basmati", this rice remains fluffy with separate 
   grains when properly cooked (usually by absorption method), though it is 
   stickier than Basmati. It can be a resonable substitute for South Indian 
   rice in regions where those varieties of rice are not available. 1 cup 
   rice needs about 1-3/4 cups of water (variable depending on age) to makes 
   about 3 cups cooked rice in 25 minutes. The photo specimens were typically 
   0.300 inches long and 0.075 inches wide (7.6 x 1.9 mm).<br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="kalij">Kalijira</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rikalij02h.jpg" alt="Kalijira White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Muthu Samba]
   <p>
   This tiny rice was once known as the "Prince of Rice" in Bengal, India 
   and used for celebrations of all kinds.  The name means "black cumin" due 
   to the unmilled rice's resemblance to the spice. It has become scarce 
   since the main rice growing region of Bengal was split off to form East 
   Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Bangladesh is very poor and overpopulated, so 
   many rice growers switched to high yield varieties.</p>
   <p>This rice has recently (2021) become more available and more affordable 
   in North America. I have seen it at 2021 US $2.48 / pound from Bangladesh 
   and $6.70 / pound from Bengal. In 2013 it was about 2013 US $10 / pound 
   plus shipping.  The photo specimens were from Bengal, 0.170 inch long and 
   0.072 inch wide (4.3 x 1.8 mm). Subst: <a href="ri_indiz.html#seera">
   <b>Jeera Samba</b></a> still grown in good quantity in Tamil Nadu and 
   relatively economical.
   <br class=cll></p>
   
   <h3>Keeri Samba</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risambk02h.jpg" alt="Keeri Samba White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Steamed Samba Rice]
   <p>
   A tiny grained rice grown in Sri Lanka (was Ceylon). It is available in 
   Red, White, and White Boiled. The boiled version has a slightly yellowed 
   color and a distinct aroma absorbed from the husks. It doesn't bother me, 
   but some have been quite taken aback and thought the rice somehow spoiled. 
   Some find the aroma objectionable. One who did, found it objectionable 
   plain or made into idlis but quite to her liking when used to make dosas. 
   This rice cooks into separate non-sticky grains. One cup of this rice 
   needs 1-3/4 cups of water and cooks in about 20 minutes. The photo 
   specimens, from Sri Lanka, white boiled, were typically 0.155 inch long 
   and 0.060 inch wide (4.7 x  1.8 mm). 
   <br class=cll></p> 
   
   <h3>Komal Saul</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ri_komal01h.jpg" alt="Komal Saul grains before soaking" class=mrg>
   Meaning "Soft Rice", this is a type of sweet rice (Bora saul) unique 
   to Assam. It is made fluffy and edible by a moderate time soaking in water, 
   and is not cooked - actually, it's already cooked. To make it, Bora Saul, 
   immediately after harvesting, is soaked overnight. It is then boiled and 
   sun dried. It is, of course, a light brown rice, as it is not polished.

   <h3 id="patna">Patna</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_ricarol02h.jpg" alt="Patna White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is a type of long grain rice grown near the city of Patna in 
   northeastern India. It is not as distinctive as the Basmati grown farther 
   to the West, much less aromatic, a bit shorter and without Basmati's 
   distinctive lengthwise expansion in cooking. Once widely exported, Patna 
   became somewhat of a generic term for long grain rice. You can use Patna 
   type rice where the rice will be distinctly spiced and seasoned, or mixed 
   with other ingredients. Use <a href="ri_indiz.html#sona"><b>Sona Masoori</b></a> 
   or <a href="ri_indiz.html#jasm"><b>Thai Jasmine</b></a> where the rice will stand on 
   its own. The photo is of American Long Grain Patna Type Rice as Indian 
   Patna was not available - the U.S. is a huge exporter of this type of 
   rice, not an importer.

   <h3 id="ponn">Ponni Arisi</h3>  
   <br><img src="img/gr_riponn02h.jpg" alt="Ponni Pachai Arisi Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Ponni Pachai Arisi (raw), Ponni Puzhungal Arisi (par boiled); 
   <i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>Indica</i>]
   <p>This rice, developed in Tamil Nadu in 1986, has become extremely popular 
   in southern India. <u>Caution</u>: advertisements on the Internet often say 
   "Ponni Raw Rice", but then describe it as boiled, thus it is actually 
   Puzhungal, which has a slightly darker color. It must be truely "raw" for 
   most Tamil Nadu breakfast items, but Puzhungal is good for Idli and Dosai 
   (often some raw mixed in for the Dosai).
   <p>Ponni is a name for the Kaveri river near which this rice is grown. 
   This rice is now a major export crop in Tamil Nadu, largely to Southeast 
   Asia, Europe and North America. Ponni has good taste and texture, but is 
   not an aromatic rice. It is a small but very long grain rice - typically 
   0.21 inch long, 0.06 inch wide, and 0.07inch thick (5.3 x 1.5 x 1.8 mm). 
   1 cup rice needs about 1-3/4 cups (variable depending on age) of water to 
   makes about 3 cups cooked rice in 25 minutes.

<h3>Puffed / Popped Rice</h3>
<br><a href="ri_puffz.html">
<img src="img/gr_ripuff05h.jpg" alt="Puffed Rice Grains" class=mrg></a>
[Puri, Mudhi, Murmuri, Pori (India); Muri (Assam); Mamra (Gujarat)]
<p>A minor product in North America, Puffed and Popped rice are very 
popular all over India, used to make Chaat (snack dishes), sweets, and 
desserts. These products are made by several methods, gun puffed (North 
America) and puffed / popped in a bed of hot salt (Indian traditional) 
and oven puffed (India).

   <h3 id="rmatt">Rose Matta</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rimatta02h.jpg" alt="Rosa Matta Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Palakkadan Matta, Kerala Matta, Kaje Rice] &nbsp; This rice is grown 
   mainly in the Palakkad region of central Karala, southwest India. It is 
   sold as a parboiled rice, boiled before husking and milling. It is much 
   more nutritious than white rice and has significant fiber, which white 
   rice does not have. Grains are typically 0.21 inch long, 0.11 inch wide 
   and 0.07 inch thick (5.3 x 2.8 x 1.8 mm). It appears to be a good 
   substitute for <a href="ri_indiz.html#goa"><b>Goa Red Rice</b></a> which is much less 
   available in North America.
   <p>This rice needs a <u>lot</u> of water (1 cup rice to 4 cups water) 
   and a long cooking time. Steamed on the stovetop or in a Rice Cooker will 
   take about 1-1/4 hours. Pressure cookers are very popular in India, and 
   here are the instructions for that. Wash rice and place in the cooker with
   water (1 cup rice to 4 cups water). Over high heat, wait until steam is 
   escaping through the vent, then drop down the weights. After 3 whistles 
   (more, whistle if your stove is very hot) turn off the heat and wait for 
   the pressure to go down (10 to 15 minutes).

   <h3>Rosa Samba</h3>  
   <br><img src="img/gr_risambr02h.jpg" alt="Pink Rosa Samba Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This is a "brown rice" version of the tiny Samba rice. Like other Samba 
   rices it is grown in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. This rice is pleasant 
   and quite mild, between a white rice and most brown rice. One cup of 
   this rice needs about 1-3/4 cups of water and cooks in about 30 
   minutes. The photo specimens, from Sri Lanka, were typically 0.150 
   inch long and 0.072 inch wide (4.6 x 2.2 mm).

   <br><img src="img/gr_rijeera02h.jpg" alt="White Seeraga Samba Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   [Jeera Samba, Jeeraga Samba]
   <p>
   A very tiny grained aromatic rice grown in the Indian province of 
   Tamil Nadu and preferred for making Biriyani in that region (basmati 
   is used elsewhere). It is the most expensive rice grown in Tamil Nadu, 
   and is named after Seera (Jeera, Cumin) because the tiny grains are 
   thought to resemble cumin seed. It is very similar to the once very 
   prestigious <a href="ri_indiz.html#kalij"><b>Kalijeera</b></a> rice of Bangladesh, 
   now uncommon. Tamil Nadu still grows plenty of Jeera.
   <p>This rice cooks fluffy with very separate grains, with excellent 
   flavor and aroma. I find it a very fine rice for serving plain as 
   well as in recipes. The photo specimens were typically 0.160 inch 
   long and 0.070 inch wide (4.9 x 2.1 mm). A cup of this rice needs 
   about 1-3/4 cup water and cooks in about 20 minutes.

   [Sona Masuri, Samba Masuri, BPT 5204, HMT, Jeela Karra Masur]
   <p>
   This rice, grown in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, was the 
   most favored rice in southern India, until the comming of Ponni. In the 
   north it is used where basmati is too expensive. It is an excellent long 
   grain rice of medium size, and the grains stay fluffy and separate. One 
   cup of rice will need 1-3/4 cups of water and will cook in 25 minutes. 
   The photo specimens were 0.215 inch long and 0.072 inch wide 
   (6.6 x 2.2 mm).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3 id="srilr">Sri Lanka Red</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/gr_risrilankr05h.jpg" alt="Sri Lanka Red Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This rice is grown in the island nation of Sri Lanka and in the far 
   southeast coast of India nearby. I very much like this rice, with it's 
   earthy aroma and taste. It is an excellent choice when plain brown 
   rice is just too plain. One cup of rice takes a shade over 2 cups of 
   water and is done in about 35 minutes, faster than most brown rice. 
   The photo specimens were 0.265 inch long and 0.070 inch wide 
   (6.7 x 1.8 mm).
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Sri Lanka Red Basmati</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risrilankb02h.jpg" alt="Sri Lanka Red Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   This rice does not resemble Indian Basmati in any way, except for the 
   grains being long and thin. These grains are, however, much smaller, 
   measuring about 0.275 inch long by 0.060 inch diameter (7.0 x 1.5 mm). 
   It also does not much resemble the Sri Lankan Red Rice above, in that 
   it is darker, takes about 2-1/4 cups of water per cup of rice and 
   takes much longer to cook, about 50 minutes. It is also less earthy 
   in aroma and taste.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   [Bora saul (Assam); Kao hnyin (Burma), Khao niao (Laos); Khao niao, 
   Khao nueng (Thai); Gao Nep (Viet)]
   <p>Bora saul sweet rice is much used in Assam state in the far northeast 
   of India. Pancakes, snacks and sweets are made from it. Development of a 
   commercially available beer made with Bora saul is in process, and it has 
   long been used for home brewed beer. Bora saul is pretty much the same as 
   Thai Long Grain Sweet Rice. The photo specimens are from Thailand and 
   were 0.255 inch long by 0.090 inch wide (6.5 x 2.3 mm). There is also 
   a black version called Kola Bora Saul. Assam is a rice exporting region, 
   so this rice is probably exported to other parts of India, where small 
   amounts are used for specific purposes.

   <br><img src="img/ri_porter01k.jpg" alt="Wild Rice Plants" class=mrg>
   [<i>Porteresia coarctata</i> syn. <i>Oryza coarctata</i>]
   <p>This is a very salt tollerant, perennial wild rice that grows in saline 
   estuaries and mangrove forrests in India, Bangledesh, Sri Lanka, and 
   Burma. In its growing region it is wild harvested and eaten as a delicacy. 
   It is considered a very important genetic resource for breeding salt 
   tolerant and perennial varieties of cultivated rice.

[<i>Oryza rufipogon</i> and hybrids]
<p>
Various varieties of this wild rice are a difficult to eradicate crop pest 
of no commercial value. The seed heads of these varieties tend to shatter 
(ripen unevenly and spill their seeds as they ripen). If seeds make into the 
harvest, consumers may think they are spoiled, or not really rice, and they 
take nutrients intended for the crop. They are listed as "noxious weeds" 
in several US States, but these wild varieties are used by plant geneticists 
developing new commercial rice varieties.
