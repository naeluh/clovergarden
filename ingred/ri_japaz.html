[<i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>japonica</i>]

<p>Rice is very expensive in Japan, and imports are restricted and heavily 
tariffed. This is to assure profitability of rice cultivation in Japan, as 
part of the country's Food Security Program. Rice is the only grain that 
can be grown in Japan in sufficient quantity. Nonetheless, Japan is the third 
largest market for rice grown in the United States, about 374,000 US Tons.  
Pretty much all is from California, where japonica rice is a specialty. 
Imports are 58% U.S. 39% Thailand and 1.7% Australia. Rice cultivation in 
Japan is highly mechanized.

   <h2 id="japa">Japanese Uruchimai Rice</h2>
   <br><img src="img/ri_japan05f.jpg" alt="Japanese Rice vs. California Rice" class=mrg>
   [<i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>japonica</i>]
   <p>Uruchimai is Japan's regular rice, a Short Grain Japonica, grown in 
   several cultivars. The photo shows Koshihikari to the left and California 
   Calrose on the right. The Calrose is medium grain, longer than the 
   Koshihikari. All rice grown in Japan is <i>japonica</i>, because it can 
   withstand cooler climates than the long grain <i>Indica</i>.	</p>

   <p>Koshihikari is the most prestigious cultivar in Japan, though 
   Akitakomachi is also well thought of. Sasanishiki is known for keeping the 
   same taste when cooled down, so a preferred cultivar for Sushi. 
   Yamada Nishiki is a cultivar grown specifically for sake. Oborozuki and 
   Yumepirika are new cultivars that can stand colder weather and are now 
   grown in Hokkaido, the large island in the far north of Japan. 
   Koshihikari is actually a recent cultivar, developed in 1956.</p>

   <p>Some Japanese rice is imported to North America, available on-line and 
   in California, but it's absurdly expensive, 2021 US $3.65 to $5.50 / pound. 
   Some Koshihikari type rice is grown in California, at about 2021 US $2.26 
   / pound and higher, vs. $1.84 for Kokuho Rose.

   <h2 id="calr">California Japonica Rice</h2>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rikokuho02h.jpg" alt="Kokuho Rose Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   <p>[<i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>japonica</i>]</p>
   <p>California rice, Calrose, Kokuho Rose, and others are medium grain 
   japonica rice cultivars developed by Japanese farmers for Japanese tastes, 
   and to be efficiently grown in California's Central Valley. This rice is 
   used by all Japanese restaurants and sushi bars in North America. The 
   Japanese consider it "inferior", but they import about 375,000 US Tons of 
   it every year. Japanese tourists heading home stop at the airport shops 
   to buy red, white, and blue bags of California rice, of the exact maximum 
   weight they are allowed to take back to Japan. The photo is of premium 
   quality Kokuho Rose medium grain rice developed by Koda Farms of South 
   Dos Palos, California, widely considered better than Calrose cultivars. 
   The photo specimens were typically 0.230 inch long and 
   0.105 inch wide (5.8 x 2.6 mm). For more details see our 
   <a href="gr_ricaljapz.html"><b>California / Japanese Rice</b></a> page.

   <h2>Mochi Rice</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This is a non-specific term for 
   Japanese sweet rice that is used to make Mochi dough, much used for 
   sweets and deserts. It is of the Short Grain Sweet variety.<p></p>

   <h2>Sushi Rice</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This is a regular japonica rice 
   seasoned with rice vinegar. Quite a few sources say it is short grain 
   sweet rice. This is wrong - sweet rice makes very inferior sushi. In 
   California, sushi rice will be Calrose, or preferably Kokuho Rose. Note 
   that one cultivar of Calrose, Botan, has been flagged as inferior for 
   sushi, yet Cooks Illustrated named it the best, and Kokuho Rose barely 
   usable. But, hey! Boston? Sushi? It is to laugh!
   <p></p>

   <h2>Short Grain Sweet Rice</h2>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risweet01h.jpg" alt="Short Grain Sweet White Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   <p>[Glutenous Rice; Mochigome (Japan)]</p>
   <p>This intensely white short grain rice is the standard type for sweet 
   rice. Sweet rice is no sweeter than any other kind, but gets the name 
   from being used mainly to make sweets and deserts. It is very low in 
   amylose and very high in amylopectin starches, so it absorbs a lot of 
   water and cooks up very sticky (but it contains no gluten). The photo 
   specimens, grown in California, by Koda Farms, were 0.200 inches long by 
   0.107 inch wide (5.1 x 2.7 mm). A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/2 cups 
   of water and cooks in about 25 minutes.

<h2>Cooking</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_ricook02h.jpg" alt="Simple Rice Cooker" class=mrg>
Nearly all Japanese households have an Electric Rice Cooker. Specialized rice 
cookers have existed in Japan since the Edo era (1603 to 1867), but those 
weren't electric and needed frequent attention. Rice cookers can be very 
simple (see photo), to units with sophisticated computer controls. Some rice 
cookers have a timed control so you can load them in the evening and they 
will turn on in time to have fresh rice for breakfast. All modern versions 
switch to "keep warm" when the rice is done. For details, see our 
<a href="../ke/ke_ricookz.html"><b>Rice Cooker</b></a> page.<p></p>

<p>Before the rice cooker, the Japanese would wash the rice well, then soak 
it for half an hour to a couple of hours depending on room temperature and age 
of rice. This may still be done for the cooker, especially the wash step which 
is always done. Then the rice would be boiled in a nearly equal amount of 
water. When the water was absorbed and the rice partially cooked, it would 
be steamed until cooked all they way through. Strangely, this is about the 
same sequence used for Persian rice.
