Sang Tarom, Hasan Sarai; Doodi (smoked rice); <i>Oryza sativa</i> Basmati 
type]</p>

<p>Domsiah is the most prestigious of the Iranian rice varieties. It is 
a highly aromatic very long grain basmati type rice with a rather low 
yield (less than 1/2 a high yield rice). It's also vulnerable to stem 
borer insects, fungus, and has harvesting problems (weak stem). The other 
varieties listed above are similar and have similar problems but together 
account for 80% of Iranian production due to customer preference. 
Development of high yield varieties continues but so far has failed to 
maintain the aromatic qualities of the genuine article. Iranian rice 
is not exported to the U.S.A. due to political reasons, and that the 
Iranians have none to spare.</p>

<p>Note that many Iranians prefer "Persian" in regard to culture, cuisine, 
and history, "Iran" in regard to the country, government and national matters. 
Persia was the Greek name for the region, and quite close to the name of 
one of the major imperial cultures there.</p>

<h2>Substitute</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_ribasm06h.jpg" alt="Basmati Rice Grains" class=mrg> 
Iranians in North America cannot get Iranian rice, so they use a good Indian 
Aged Basmati, though they consider Indian rice inferior to real Iranian rice. 
Royal, India Gate, Dunar, Tilda, and Farmer's Club are popular brands. 
Iranians use no other type of rice in Iran, but Iranians in North America 
may use Thai Jasmine for a few selected dishes - it is much shorter and a 
bit stickier.

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<img src="img/nsg_richel1h.jpg" alt="Persian Rice with Tahdig" class=mrg></a>
Rice came rather late to Iran. The first mention of it in text is from 
about the 7th century and only along the Caspian seacoast. Bread was the 
staple for the rest of Iran. Rice as a staple started to spread to the 
rest of Iran in the 13th century and by the end of the 16th century it had 
become a major part of cooking throughout the country.
<p>Almost all Iranian rice is still grown along the coast of the Caspian 
Sea, where it was being grown in the 7th century. Despite it's late 
appearance, Iran developed a method of cooking very different from how 
rice is prepared by its neighbors. Only in Gilan, along part of the Caspian 
coast, is our familiar absorption form of rice cooking traditional. 
<br class=cll>

<p><b>Chelo ba Tahdig</b> is the "official" Persian Rice. It is made in steps: 
washing, soaking, boiling, and then steaming, always with a crispy crust 
called Tahdig (lit. "bottom of the pot"). It's on the bottom, which becomes 
the top when the rice is turned out.  For details see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/nsg_richel1.html"><b>Persian Rice</b></a>. Today, it is 
also made in a single pass in special rice cookers that produces a crispy 
bottom.</p>

<p><b>Kateh</b> is rice cooked by the familiar absorbtion method. Originating 
from Gilan on the Caspian coast, it has spread to other parts of Iran as an 
"everyday rice" recipe. It is often served plain with plain yogurt to sooth 
the digestive system.</p>

<p><b>Dami</b> is just like Kateh, except that grains or beans are steamed 
  along with the rice. They should be well soaked before mixing with the 
  rice.</p>
