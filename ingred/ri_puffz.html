<p>
Puffed and Popped Rice are very popular in India, especially in Odisha and 
West Bengal, but also in Karnataka, Mangalore and elsewhere. It is used to 
make Chaat (Snack dishes), Sweets, and Desserts. American puffed rice 
(gun puffed) is a bit lighter, whiter and more consistent than that made in 
India, but the Indian may have more flavor. The photo specimens are from 
India, probably oven puffed.</p>

<p>These products are made by several processes, but in all cases the the 
rice must have enough internal water. For puffed rice it must be parboiled 
or cooked to gelatinize the starch, then partially dried. Popped rice must 
be brown rice so the outside coating has enough strength to hold steam 
pressure until it explodes.</p>

<p>The traditional method in India is to stir the prepared rice into a bed 
of very hot salt, which causes it to puff or pop immediately.  The Western 
method is "gun puffing", where the prepared grains are heated moderately 
under high pressure. When the pressure is released, the rice puffs up. 
Commercial makers in India usually use ovens. Some heat their ovens with 
burning rubber tires to get a high enough temperature - with a serious 
negative impact on health and environment.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product is available in any market serving a 
substantial Indian community. It is packed in large plastic bags and 
usually attractively priced.<p></p>

<h3>Storeing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep in a very tightly sealed plastic bag. that way 
it will keep for months.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Some of this rice comes with a lot of powder in 
the package. You can remove it by tossing the rice in a wire mesh strainer. 
If it is not as crisp as you would like (likely), pour it into a cold wok 
and place over high heat. Keep tumbling it until you see the first trace of 
browning, then get it off the heat and keep stirring until the pan is cooler.
