<p>The earliest hard evidence of rice cultivation we have is from China, but 
rice was native to either Southeast Asia or southern India, so was probably 
cultivated there much earlier. Wet tropical regions are not noted for 
preserving evidence.&nbsp; <small>Photo by ryanwh distributed under license

<p>Rice remains critically important throughout Southeast Asia, because the 
region is too hot and wet for other grains. The predominant type for meals is 
long grain Jasmine rice, except in Laos and Issan, the Lao region of 
Thailand. There, Thai Long Grain Sweet Rice dominates. The rest of the region 
uses sweet rice mainly for sweets (thus the name), treats, and deserts.</p>

<h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Unlike most of the world, Southeast Asians do not 
generally salt their rice, because it will be served with very salty 
condiments and sauces.  Americans, and I suspect Europeans, will choose to 
salt rice prepared for Southeast Asian foods, because we serve it differently, 
with the rice more separate.<p></p>

   <h3 id="jasm">Thai Jasmine Rice</h3>

   [Thai Basmati; Hom Mali (Thai); Milagrosa (Philippines); Cambodia Fragrant; 
   <i>Oryza sativa</i> var <i>indica</i>]
   <p>
   This long grain and distinctly aromatic rice is preferred in much of 
   Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. The major exporter has usually 
   been Thailand, but due to a Thai government program they were passed by 
   Vietnam in 2012. Some is also exported by Cambodia. It is a preferred 
   variety grown in the Philippines, but not much exported from there. Some 
   say it originated in the Philippines, others that it originated in 
   Thailand. It is 15% to 18% amylose.</p>
   <p>Sometimes called "Thai basmati", this rice remains fluffy with separate 
   grains (though not quite as fluffy as basmati) and is an ideal rice for 
   serving plain steamed with Southeast Asian, South Indian, and Southern 
   Chinese dishes. For northern China, typically California rice, and for 
   northern India, Basmati. 1 cup rice needs about 1-3/4 cups (variable 
   depending on age) of water to makes about 3 cups cooked rice in 25 minutes. 
   The photo specimens were typically 0.300 inches long and 0.075 inches wide 
   (7.6 x 1.9 mm).

[Beaten Rice, Rice Flakes, Pounded Rice; Poha (India); Chira (Assam)]
<p>This product is made in the Philippines from a short grain rice. It is 
used for deserts and drinks. The grains are cooked, flattened into flakes 
and dried.

   <h3>Black Thai Sweet</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rithaibs02h.jpg" alt="Thai Black Sweet Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   [Gao Nep Than (Viet); Purple Thai Rice]
   <p>
   This is a fairly large moderately long grain sweet rice which turns 
   to a very dark purple when cooked, and colors other ingredients it is 
   cooked with. With the bran layer on it only becomes a little bit 
   sticky, but it is more tender than a lot of brown rice, with a quite 
   pleasant nutty flavor and just a little crunch at the bran layer. It 
   is sold as a "brown rice" to preserve the unique color and flavor 
   (the grains are white inside). A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/4 
   cups of water and 45 minutes cooking time. The photo specimens were 
   typically 0.275 inch long and 0.105 inch wide (7.0 x . 2.7 mm)</p>

   <h3>Red Thai Cargo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rithairc02h.jpg" alt="Red Thai Cargo Rice Grains" class=mrg>   
   [Gao luc do (Viet)]
   <p>
   This is a long grain rice with a reddish brown bran and a "nut-like" 
   flavor. This is sold as a "brown" rice with the bran on to preserve 
   the color and flavor. "Cargo rice" means "Brown rice" in some regions. 
   A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil 
   uncovered, then cover tightly and simmer for about 60 minutes. It is 
   still fairly chewy, but flavor is decent. The photo specimens were 
   typically 0.257 inch long and 0.075 inch wide (6.5 x 1.9 mm).

   <h3>Short Grain Sweet Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_risweet01h.jpg" alt="Grains of White Short Grain Sweet Rice" class=mrg>
   [Glutinous Rice, Sticky Rice]
   <p>This intensely white short grain rice is the standard type for sweet rice 
   through East Asia, including Japan. is not much used in Southeast Asia 
   where the Thai long grain dominates. This form may be used in the 
   Philippines, I haven't determined that for sure. Sweet rice is no sweeter 
   than any other kind, but gets the name from being used mainly to make 
   sweets and deserts. It is very high in amylopectin starch and very low in 
   amylose starch, so it absorbs a lot of water and is very sticky. The photo 
   specimens, grown in California, were 0.200 inches long by 0.107 inch wide 
   (5.1 x 2.7 mm). A cup of this rice needs about 2-1/2 cups of water and 
   cooks in about 25 minutes.

   <h3 id="tiswl">Thai Long Grain Sweet Rice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/gr_rithails02h.jpg" alt="Grains of Thai White Long Grain Sweet Rice" class=mrg>
   [Glutinous Rice, Sticky Rice, Gao Nep Thuong Hang (Viet)]
   <p>This is the preferred Sweet Rice in Southeast Asia. It is used in 
   Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia and even Taiwan. It's use extends north 
   all the way into Assam, India. This is the only acceptable rice to use for 
   Laotian and Thai Laotian cuisine. For Lao peoples, sweet rice is the main 
   rice rather than just for sweets and treats. This  preference extends 
   through the Isaan region of Thailand, which is predominantly Lao. It is 
   soaked for an amount of time dependent on how old the rice is. For rice 
   exported to North America it is pretty much sure it needs the 8 hour soak 
   for older rice. It is then steamed in a special conical straw basket lined 
   with cheese cloth. For details see our <a href="gr_ricew.html#steams">
   <b>Working with Rice</b></a> page. These grains, from Thailand were 
   0.255 inch long by 0.090 inch wide (6.5 x 2.3 mm).

   <h3>West Java Volcano Rice</h3>  
   <br><img src="img/gr_rivolcan02h.jpg" alt="Pink West Java Volcano Rice Grains" class=mrg>
   This rice is a mix of three West Java grains, and imported by Lotus 
   Foods. It consists of Javanese Sintanur brown rice, a very prestigious 
   rice, mixed with whole red rice and lightly milled red rice. 
   A cup of rice needs about 1-3/4 cups of water and cooks in about 30 
   minutes. The photo specimens were 0.257 inch long by 0.080 inch wide 
   (7.8 x 2.4 mm).

<h2>Wild Rice - Asian</h2>
<br><img src="img/gr_riwilda01h.jpg" alt="Asian Wild Rice Grains" class=mrg>
[<i>Oryza rufipogon</i> and hybrids]
<p>
Various varieties of this wild rice are a difficult to eradicate crop pest 
of no commercial value. The seed heads of these varieties tend to shatter 
(ripen unevenly and spill their seeds as they ripen). If seeds make into the 
harvest, consumers may think they are spoiled, or not really rice, and they 
take nutrients intended for the crop. They are listed as "noxious weeds" 
in several US States, but these wild varieties are used by plant geneticists 
developing new commercial rice varieties.
