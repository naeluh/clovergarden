<p>This member of the mostly inedible Ranunculales order is native to 
South and Southwest Asia. The seeds, which look a bit like the totally 
unrelated onion seeds, are used as a spice in India, the Middle East, 
Near East, Anatolia, Caucasus, Greece and Egypt. They have a strong, 
aromatic and slightly bitter taste.</p>

<p>Nigella seeds are often mixed into Armenian string cheese, scattered 
on the outside of Nabulsi cheese, and used on some Jewish baked goods. 
In India, Nigella (Kalonji) is used as a regular spice in many curries 
and other dishes. Nigella is held to have strong medicinal properties 
for a number of illnesses. The photo specimens were typically 0.104 
inch long and 0.55 inch across.</p>
