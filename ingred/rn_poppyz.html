[Black Poppy Seed &nbsp; | &nbsp; White Poppy Seed; Khas Khas 
  (India) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Papaver somniferum</i> of order 
  <i>Ranunculales</i>]
<p>There are two kinds of poppy seeds sold on the spice markets, Black and 
White. They are imperfectly interchangeable due to color, taste and other 
characteristics. Both come from the infamous opium poppy, but 
contain only tiny amounts of the psychoactive alkalis morphine and 
codeine. Those have to be gathered from the sap long before the seeds 
are mature enough to harvest. Drug tests, however, may come out positive 
from eating poppy seed rolls, muffins or bagels. Poppy seed is also used 
as an oil seed, but in North America it's used for slow drying artist's 
oil paints rather than for cooking.</p>

<h3>Black Poppy Seeds</h3> are commonly used in Europe and the U.S. 
sprinkled on baked goods and in baked goods stuffings. The photo 
specimens were 0.020 inch diameter.<p></p>
<h3>White Poppy Seeds</h3> are milder than the black. They are always 
called for in Indian cooking, where they are used roasted and ground. 
They serve as both a flavoring and as a thickening agent in light 
colored sauces. They come from a line of poppies specifically bred for 
these mild light colored seeds. The photo specimens were 0.020 inch 
diameter.<p></p>
<p>In India, these used to be cheap and plentiful, so many older recipes 
call for a lot of them. Today, the poppy crop is tightly regulated and 
much smaller, so they are too expensive to use in traditional 
quantities.</p>
