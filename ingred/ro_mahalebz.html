   This cherry tree is native from central and southern Europe east to 
   Pakistan and Kyrgystan, and south to Morocco and Lebanon. It produces 
   small red cherries that are thin fleshed and bitter, eaten mainly by 
   birds. The cherry pits are broken open to release the kernel, which is 
   used as a spice for holiday sweets and cakes, particularly in Greece, 
   Turkey, Armenia, Cyprus, Lebanon. Syria and Iraq. It is also used to 
   flavor Nabulsi cheese.
   <p>It is described as tasting like a combination of cherry and bitter 
   almond. Myself I don't detect much cherry, but it has a moderately 
   bitter aromatic resin taste. The specimen photo shows seed kernels 
   0.2 inch (5 mm) long purchased from a market in Los Angeles. It 
   is more available in powdered form, but that must be fresh as it 
   degrades rapidly. The seed kernels also must not be stored long, 
   as they become rancid within a year or so.
