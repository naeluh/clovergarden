<p><i>Rosales</i> is a large order containing about 260 genera and 7700 
species, included in 9 families. Many of these species are of great 
culinary and nutritional importance, particularly for fruit. It is one 
of the most important orders of the Eudicot clade <i>Rosids</i>.

  - &nbsp; [<i>Rosaceae</i>]
<br>This family contains at least 2830 species in at least 95 genera 
and abounds in familiar (and some unfamiliar) edible species. It is 
so large it has been divided into several Subfamilies and those into 
Tribes and Subtribes. We arranged those that are of culinary interest 
in a simplified format to avoid excessive brain strain.

   <img src="img/ro_pom06c.jpg" alt="Mixed Fruit" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
   </p><p>
   This tribe is very important for large fruits eaten raw or cooked - 
   Apples, Pears, Loquats, Quinces and others. The characteristic of this 
   tribe is fruit where a swollen flower base has wrapped its thick 
   edible flesh completely around the actual fruit and its seeds.
   The <a href="rosepf.html"><b>Pome Fruits</b></a> have their own 
   page.

   <img src="img/rs_stone03c.jpg" alt="Basket of Fruit" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
   </p><p>
   Almost as important as the Pome Fruits, this tribe produces peaches, 
   plums and cherries. Here the thick edible flesh is the middle layer 
   of the actual fruit. The swollen flower base of the pome fruit is 
   completely missing.	 The

   </p><p>
   <p>This subfamily contains two genera of "berries" of culinary note, 
   including blackberries, raspberries and strawberries, plus the the 
   actual Roses, and some herbs. In these berries, the swollen flower base is 
   turned inside out, and is covered by a myriad of fruits similar in 
   structure to stone fruits, but tiny with very tiny stones.  The fruit 
   of actual Roses is more like the pome fruits. The 
   <a href="roseby.html"><b>Berries, Herbs &amp; Flowers</b></a> have

<img src="img/od_juju08c.jpg" alt="Jujubies" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
The Buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae) is a modest size family of mostly 
thorny flowering plants found in temperate and subtropical climates 
worldwide. The family provides only a few food items, but was once 
important for charcoal used to make gunpowder. This family has it's 
own <a href="bt_bkthorn.html"><b>Buckthorns Page</b></a>.

</p><p>
The mulberry family is found worldwide in 
tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. American mulberries are but 
3/4 inch long, but the mulberry family accounts also for the largest tree 
fruit in the world, exceeding 80 pounds and three feet long. This family 
has it's own <a href="mb_mulberry.html"><b>Mulberries Page</b></a>.

<img src="img/or_igde01c.jpg" alt="Russian Olives" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
Oleasters are a small family with only three genera. They mostly inhabit 
northern temperate climates, but some species extend through Southeast 
Asia to Australia. In Europe and Asia they have been used as minor food 
items and medicinals since prehistoric times. This family 
has it's own <a href="or_oleast.html"><b>Oleaster Page</b></a>.

<img src="img/hp_hempp01c.jpg" alt="Hemp Leaves" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
The Hemp family (Cannabaceae) is a small family of herbs, vines, shrubs 
and small trees, consisting of only about 9 Genera in all. While hemp is 
a very useful industrial, culinary and medicinal plant, its use in the 
United States has been greatly hindered by the misguided and totally 
failed "war on drugs", which has succeeded only in transferring billions 
of dollars to criminals - and providing many thousands of lifelong but 
worthless careers for government employees. This family 
has it's own <a href="hp_hemp.html"><b>Hemp Page</b></a>.

<p><a name="nettle"><big><b><big>Nettle Family</big></b></big></a> &nbsp; 
  - &nbsp; [<i>Urticaceae</i>]
<br>This family contains about 2600 species in 54 to 79 genera (depending 
on which expert you consult), but is not big on edibles. A number of 
species are locally important for fiber.</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">

   <img src="img/od_nettle01e.jpg" alt="Leaves" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0"></a>
   </p><p>
   The Stinging Nettle is the most common culinary member of the 
   <i>Urticaceae</i> family, though others are also eaten locally. 
   This highly nutritious plant was important to the Native 
   population of North America, but it has fallen out of use here except 
   as an ingredient in some herbal teas and hair treatment formulas.</p> 
   <p>Nettles are still eaten frequently in Ireland, where they were one 
   of the major reasons the English were not able to starve <u>all</u> 
   the Irish to death during the potato famine. They contain more usable 
   protein than just about any other leafy green, in general by a wide 
   margin. Nettles are also eaten in parts of Northern and Eastern 
   Europe, as well as in Italy - and in Nepal and the neighboring Kumaon 
   division of India. They also have medicinal uses, particularly in 
   treatment of arthritis.

   This shrub, which can grow to 13 feet high, is native to Bhutan, 
   northeastern India, China, Taiwan and Japan. The fruit is edible and 
   can be eaten fresh or used to make jams or wine. The bark of the 
   plant is used for fiber.
