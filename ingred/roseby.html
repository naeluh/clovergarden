<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>Subfamily <i>Rosoideae</i> contains around 850 species in at least 
42 genera of mostly perennial shrubs and herbs. The subfamily is best 
known for decorative Roses, but a few species present us with familiar 
fruits, called berries. Others are not as well known as food, but 
provide herbs, roots and flowers. Many of these species are significant 
for medicinal uses.

<h2 id="bramb">Brambles</h2>
<br>[genus <i>Rubus</i>] &nbsp; These plants produce fruits similar to 
plums and other Stone Fruit, but they are tiny and loosely glued together 
into clusters. The stones are so small they're eaten right along with the 
flesh.<p></p>

   <h3>Blackberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_byblack06e.jpg" alt="Blackberries on Dish" class=mrg>
   [<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; California Blackberry; 
   <i>Rubus ursinus</i>]
   <p>
   Blackberries are cultivated in the temperate zones of North America, 
   South America and Europe, particularly the British Isles. The US State 
   of Oregon is the leading commercial producer. Since these plants hybridize 
   easily there are many cultivars, both commercial and for home gardeners. 
   Blackberries are generally quite a bit larger than the similar 
   raspberries.</p>
   <p>Blackberries are high in vitamin C, vitamin K, folic acid and 
   manganese as well as being high in antioxidants. Blackberries, including 
   fruit, leaves and roots, have a number of medicinal uses.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Raspberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_byrasp06e.jpg" alt="Red Raspberries on Dish" class=mrg>
   [<i>Rubus idaeus var idaeus</i> (Eurasian), <i>Rubus idaeus var 
   strigosus</i> (American), <i>Rubus occidentalis</i> (American Black 
   Raspberry), others]
   <p>
   Raspberries are an important commercial crop throughout the northern 
   temperate region. They are rather difficult to pack and ship fresh 
   because they are so fragile, so most are frozen or processed into 
   juices and flavorings. They now come in several colors.

<h2 id="straw">Strawberries</h2>
<br>These fruits consist of a cup shaped base that supports the ovaries. 
This base swells up and becomes convex as the fruit ripens. The true 
fruits, which we think of as seeds, remain embedded in the skin surface 
which is now the outside.<p></p>

   <h3>Garden Strawberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_bystraw05e.jpg" alt="California Strawberries on Dish whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Fragaria</i> x <i>ananassa</i>]
   <p>
   California produces 75% of the strawberries grown in the US, and 
   Florida is second, growing mostly California varieties.  Oregon also 
   produces strawberries commercially but mostly the Canadian Totem 
   variety more suited to processing than eating fresh.</p>
   <p>Every other state claims their small berries are far superior in 
   flavor to the big California berries, but the big berries are 
   economical to harvest, ship well, and look really great on fruit 
   plates. So important is the strawberry crop to California that a 
   major new highway was routed around a patch of wild strawberries that 
   are part of the gene pool used to develop the state's varieties.

   <h3>Woodland Strawberry</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_bystraww01e.jpg" alt="Live Woodland Strawberrys" class=mrg>
   [Alpine Strawberry, Wild European Strawberry; Fraises des Bois 
   (French); <i>Fragaria vesca</i>]
   <p>
   These strawberries have been consumed by humans for more than 10,000 
   years but are today used mainly to flavor liqueurs, jams and sauces. 
   They have a much stronger flavor than garden strawberries but are 
   difficult to harvest due to their small size. The largest grower is 
   Turkey, which exports most of the harvest to Europe.

   <h3>Damask Rose - Water</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_damask01h.jpg" alt="Damask Rose Flower" class=mrg>
   [<i>Rosa x damascena</i>]
   <p>
   This very fragrant rose is a hybrid of <i>Rosa Gallica</i>, probably 
   from the Caucasus, and <i>Rosa moschata</i>, the Musk Rose, probably 
   from the western Himalayas. It is harvested in manufacture of Rose 
   Water, an important flavoring throughout India, Persia, the Middle 
   East, and still used in parts of Europe.</p>
   <p>Rose Water is used primarily in sweets and deserts. Rose syrup, made 
   from rosewater and sugar, is popular in France, used in drinks and deserts.

   <br><img src="img/rp_ropetl02h.jpg" alt="Damask Rose Petals" class=mrg>

   <p>
   This very fragrant rose is a hybrid of <i>Rosa Gallica</i>, probably 
   from the Caucasus, and <i>Rosa moschata</i>, the Musk Rose, probably 
   from the western Himalayas. It is harvested for Rose Petals, which are 
   important in the cuisines of India, Persia, and the Middle East, and 
   were in Europe from ancient times into the Renaissance. They are most 
   used powdered in stews, dips, and sauces, and sprinkled on yogurt.</p>
   <p>Gulkand, originating in India, is a preserve made of whole fresh rose 
   petals mixed with sugar and water, then simmered down until thickened. 
   This potion is also used medicinally in some Asian systems.

   <h3>Rose Hips</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rp_rowild02h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Rose Hips" class=mrg>
   [<i>Rosa canina</i>]
   <p>
   Roses produce fruits structured similarly to apples and pears but much 
   smaller and much less fleshy. Commercial rose hips come from a simple 
   five petal rose (<i>Rosa canina</i> or Dog Rose) native to 
   Europe and Western Asia. The fruits are used in herbal teas and 
   otherwise for their high content of antioxidants, vitamin C and other 
   medicinally important substances. It is reported that during the 
   Vietnam War rose hips were dried, mixed with tobacco and smoked to 
   produce mild hallucinations and abnormal dreams, but this needs 
   verification. The photo specimenns were up to 1 inch long and 0.6 
   inch diameter, weighing 12 to the ounce (2.3 grams each). They were 
   shipped frozen from Lithuania.

   [Garden Burnet, Small burnet; <i>Sanguisorba minor</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   Great Burnet; <i>Sanguisorba officinalis</i>
   <p>
   <i>S. minor</i> is a perennial herb growing to a bit less than 3 feet 
   high, but usually lower. It is native to Europe, northwest Africa and 
   southwest Asia, and has colonized most of North America. It is highly 
   thought of as a salad ingredient, used in both salads and dressings, 
   with a light cucumber-like flavor. It was favored by Thomas Jefferson 
   and planted on his estate. Young leaves should be used as they become 
   bitter with age. Medicinal virtues are similar to those of Great 
   Burnet.
   <p>Great Burnet looks pretty much like Salad Burnet but is 
   taller, growing to a little over 3 feet high. Leaves picked before 
   flowering can be used raw in salads or cooked. Fresh or dried leaves 
   are used in herbal teas. The plant has a number of medicinal uses.

   <p>
   This perennial herb is native to bogs, marshes and roadsides from 
   Labrador in Canada to Georgia in the United States, from Illinois to 
   the East Coast. It grows to as much as 5 feet high. The leaves are 
   edible with the light cucumber flavor found in Salad Burnet, but 
   unless the leaves are very young they need to be cooked to remove 
   the bitterness.

   <h3>Common Silverweed</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_silverw01c.jpg" alt="Leafy Common Silverweed Plant" class=mrg>
   [Dj&uuml;ma, Toma, Doma, Droma (Tibet); Silverweed Cinquefoil, 
   Goosewort, Goose grass, Goose tansy; <i>Argentina anserina</i>]
   <p>
   This plant is native to most of the temperate regions of the Northern 
   Hemisphere, spreading by runners and growing to about 8 inches high 
   with yellow flowers. The underside of the leaves is covered with 
   silvery hairs, thus the name "silverweed". While the roots were 
   used as food in the Scottish Highlands before arrival of the potato, 
   and by American Indians, today they are used mostly in Tibet and 
   Nepal. The plant is also widely used as a medicinal, particularly 
   for menstrual cramps and intestinal problems.</p>
   <p>They are said to taste somewhat like parsnips. Preferably this is 
   a cultivated crop because the roots of the wild varieties are small 
   and stringy, but can still be dried and ground int flour as they were 
   in Scotland for bread making. In Tibet they may be cooked with butter 
   and sugar as a sweet, but more importantly the flour can be added to 
   the porridge of barley flour and butter served to small children. The 
   protein profile of Droma complements that of barley, the main Tibetan 
   staple.
