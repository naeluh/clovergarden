<h1>Pome Fruits</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The main edible part of these fruits is actually a swollen flower base 
which wraps around a group of seeds and their surrounds, called the 
"core". The core is the real fruit, and if you cut a pome fruit 
lengthwise you can usually see a faint line outlining the division. 
Recent reclassification puts these in Family <i>Rosaceae</i>, Subfamily 
<i>Amygdaloideae</i>, Tribe <i>Maleae</i>, Subtribe <i>Malinae</i>.</p>

<h2 id="apple">Apples</h2>
<p>[<i>Malus domestica</i>] &nbsp; The cultivated apple originated in 
Central Asia, around Kazakhstan, where it's wild ancestor (<i>Malus 
sylvestris</i>) can still be found today. China grows 35% of world 
production and the US, where apples were introduced by European 
colonists, is second with 7.5%

<p>There are over 7500 known varieties of apple, the ones listed here are 
ones commonly available in Southern California. Nearly all are grown in the 
Pacific Northwest, particularly Washington state, where the weather gets cold 
enough to set fruit properly.</p>

   <h3>Braeburn</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/ro_apbraeb02e.jpg" alt="Braeburn Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4103 (large) 4101 (small)]
   <p>
   An excellent eating apple in my opinion, sweet/tart with good 
   flavor complexity. The photo specimens, "large braeburn", were typically 
   3-1/4 inch in diameter and weighed 10 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Cameo</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apcameo01e.jpg" alt="Cameo Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 3066 (large) 3065 (small)]
   <p>
   A crisp, medium sweet apple with good apple flavor and a very small 
   core. Excellent for salads. The photo specimens, "large cameo", were 
   typically 3-1/4 inches in diameter and weighed 9 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Cosmic Crisp</h3> &nbsp; [WA38]
   <br><img src="img/rp_apcosmic02e.jpg" alt="Cosmic Crisp Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   I first noticed this apple here in Los Angeles in late December 2020. It 
   was developed by Washington State University and released in 2019.It is an 
   extremely crisp apple, juicy, with considerable sweetness, and very good 
   apple flavor. It is also very resistant to browning when cut. The cut 
   surface will dry out with no change in color.
   <p>Ironically, the main objectives of the developers were just durability 
   and shelf life. The photo specimens were typically 3.3 inches diameter, 
   2.9 inch high and weighed 9 ounces. The specimens were purchased from a 
   multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2020 US $0.99 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Crab Apple</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apcrab01e.jpg" alt="Crab Apples, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   These are fairly close to wild crab apples - note the long stems and 
   small size. The largest was 1-1/2 ounce, 1.6 inch long and 1.7 inch 
   diameter, but most were considerably smaller. These were sold in an 
   Asian market in Los Angels as "Sweet Crab Apple". They were mildly 
   tart with just a hint of bitterness.
   <br class=cll><p></p>  
   
   <h3>Crab Apple - So Called</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apcrabnot01e.jpg" alt="Crabby Apples, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   These are crab apples by marketing name only. They are quite small but 
   taste just like regular domestic apples. Rather expensive for eating 
   out of hand but a good size for salads. The photo specimens ranged 
   from 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 inches diameter and weighed between 5/8 and 1-1/4 
   ounce.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Fuji</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apfujil06e.jpg" alt="Fuji Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4131 (large)]
   <p>This Japanese style apple is now quite popular here in both "large" 
   and "small" sizes. It has silky, sweet flesh and light apple flavor. 
   A quite pleasant snack apple. It can be stored at room temperature or 
   (longer) refrigerated for longer periods than most other apple 
   varieties. The photo specimens were the "large" size, typically 3.9 
   inches diameter and weighed 13-1/2 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Granny Smith</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apgsmith08e.jpg" alt="Granny S Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4017 (large)]
   <p>This is the standard cooking apple, firm and tart. It can be stored 
   at room temperature or (longer) refrigerated for longer periods than 
   most other apple varieties. The photo specimens were the "large" size, 
   typically 3.6 inches diameter and weighed 10-1/2 ounces. "Small" and 
   "lady" sizes are also available.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Jonagold</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apjonag02e.jpg" alt="Jonagold Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4145 (small)]
   <p>
   A good eating apple, almost crisp, sweet-tart with good apple flavor.   
   The photo specimens were the "large" size (back), typically 2.9 inches 
   diameter and weighed 11-1/8 ounces and "small" (front) 2.9 inches 
   diameter and weighed 5-3/4 ounces..
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Lady Apple</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_aplady06e.jpg" alt="Lady Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   Miniature versions of a number of apples now have the "lady" designation, 
   but this one seems to be the one sold without additional qualifiers, at 
   least around here. They are firm and tart, but not as tart as Granny 
   Smith (for which there is also a "lady" version). The photo specimens 
   were typically 2.1 inches diameter and weighed 2 ounces.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Pi&ntilde;ata Apple</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/rp_appina03e.jpg" alt="Pi&ntilde;ata Apples, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Pinova, Sonata, PLU #3435]
   <p>
   This is a very good eating apple, but also holds up well to various 
   cooking methods, including poaching, baking, and used in stuffings. 
   It is thin skinned, crisp, juicy, sweet, and with a firm smooth flesh. 
   I consider this one of my favorite apples. This is a medium size 
   apple up to about 3.5 inches diameter and 9.5 ounces.</p>
   <p> The Pi&ntilde;ata apple was developed in Germany in the 1970s, 
   and it was sold in Germany until 2004 when growing rights were 
   purchased by the Stemilt company of Washington State USA. Supposedly 
   it is stored until after Christmas and then released, but I have 
   purchased them in November 2019 here in Los Angeles, for as low as 
   2019 US $0.79 / pound.
   <br class=cll></p>
   
   <h3>Red Delicious</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_apredd02e.jpg" alt="Red Delicious Apples whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4015 (small)]
   <p>
   This was once the dominant apple available in stores - until growers 
   in the Pacific Northwest discovered that people actually wanted apples 
   with more apple flavor. These are easily recognizable by their perfect 
   intense red color and pointy shape.</p>
   <p>At best they are crisp and juicy, moderately sweet, but 
   have little flavor. At worst they are dry, pasty and flavorless. They 
   also  don't cook well. They are subject to freeze damage when the flesh 
   will be discolored and slightly translucent. The photo specimens were 
   typically 2.9 inches diameter and weighed 6-5/8 ounces - this is the 
   "small" size.  Large ones run about 3-1/4 inches diameter and weight 
   about 10 ounces.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Spartan Apple</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rp_apspart03e.jpg" alt="Spartan Apple Cut and Whole" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4177, 4178 (small)  4179, 4180 (large)]
   <p>
   This medium size apple is a very good general purpose variety. It has 
   good flavor and sweetness. Developed in Canada, this was to be the 
   first apple resulting from "scientific breeding" - but something went 
   wrong. It was supposed to be a cross of McIntosh and Newton Pippin, 
   but its mother was fooling around on the side. Recent genetic 
   analysis shows no relationship to Newton Pippin - and the father is 
   still unknown. Well, this is the case for 10% to 20% (depending on 
   demographics) of humans here in North America. The photo specimens 
   were about 1.9 inches diameter and weighed 5-3/4 ounces.

<h2 id="pear">Pears</h2>
<p>[Nashpati (India), <i>Pyrus</i> species] &nbsp; Pears are thought to 
have originated in Central Asia, but have been in European cultivation 
for something like 10,000 years.</p>

<p>Pears are not allowed to ripen on the tree because they will become 
gritty and won't sweeten well.  Fully ripe pears are also so tender 
shipping would be a real problem, Buy them fairly firm and let them ripen 
on the counter. The exception is Asian pears (including Yali) which do 
sweeten on the tree.</p>

   <h3>d'Anjou</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_prdanj02e.jpg" alt="Anjou Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Anjou, <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   Originally known as Beurr d' Anjou, this pear is thought to have 
   originated near Anjers, France. d'Anjous are excellent cooking pears 
   when used before they are completely ripe. Fully ripe they are good 
   for snacks and salads. These pears do not change color as they ripen 
   - available October through June.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3 id="asia">Asian Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rp_prnash02e.jpg" alt="Three Nashi Pears, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [#4408; Nashi Pear, Apple Pear, Sand Pear, Japanese Pear, Korean Pear, 
   Chinese Pear; Bae (Korea); Nashpati (Nepal, Himalayan states of India); 
   <i>P. pyrifolia</i>]
   <p>
   These pears have become quite common and affordable in markets now that 
   they are grown commercially in Southern California orchards. In Korean 
   grocery markets here you can buy much more expensive ones shipped from 
   Korea and claimed to be superior. These pears are particularly 
   popular in Korea, where the juice is often an ingredient in meat 
   marinades, particularly for beef. </p>
   <p>These pears are available from two cultivar groups, "Russet" and 
   "Green". A Russets to the right in the photo and the "Green" is to 
   the left. The russet in the photo is a bit smaller, but that is not 
   a characteristic, both can be up to a little over 1 pound. Compared to 
   Western pears these have crisp, grainy flesh and a high water content, 
   and are apple shaped rather than pear shaped. They are not cooked due 
   to their high water content, but are commonly served raw and peeled. 
   They are also used ground as a sweetener in sauces and for  marinades. 
   Unlike Western pears these pears ripen fully on the tree. The larger 
   of the photo specimens was about 3-5/8 inches diameter and weighted 
   14-5/8 ounces. The Russet, grown in USA, was purchased from a produce 
   store in Los Angeles at 2015 US $0.99 / pound, and the Green, imported 
   from China, from an Asian market for 2015 US $1.39 / pound. The russet 
   are available most of the year now.

   <h3>Bartlet</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_prbart02e.jpg" alt="Bartlet Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Williams (everywhere except the US); <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   This is the most commonly used pear for canning, making into preserves 
   and chutneys and for drying. They are also a fine snack pear when ripe.
   This pears change color from green to bright yellow as it ripens - 
   available August through January.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3>Bosc Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_prboscs01e.jpg" alt="Bosc Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Beurre Bosc, Kaiser Alexander, PLU 4413 (large), 4026 (small); 
   <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   Originally from Belgium or France, this is a crisp pear of moderate 
   sweetness with a very small core (I usually just swallow the seeds rather 
   than bothering to core these). I consider this a fine eating pear and 
   it's usually inexpensive, but some may prefer a softer sweeter pear.</p>
   <p>Bosc pears are unusual in that they become sweet and ready to eat while 
   still very firm. Check ripeness by finding some give to thumb pressure at 
   the stem end. Because it's flesh is firm and aromatic this is considered 
   an excellent cooking pear. The photo specimens were typically 
   2-5/8 inches in  diameter, 4 inches long and weighed 6-1/2 ounces, but 
   they do get larger - these were marked PLU 4026 "Small Bosc". These 
   pears do not change color as they ripen - available September through 
   April. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Agyle contributed to the public domain.

   <h3>Comice</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rp_prcomi01k.jpg" alt="Whole Comice Fruit" class=mrg>
   [Doyenn Du Comice, <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   Officially Doyenn&eacute; du Comice, this is an excellent desert pear. 
   Juicy and sweet, it goes well with cheese. It originated in Angers, 
   France in the mid 1800's and is mostly green, but a red versions was 
   discovered in Medford Oregon between 1960 and 1970. Comice accounts 
   for only 1% of US production. Available September through February.

   <br><img src="img/ro_prforel02e.jpg" alt="Forella Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [PLU 4418; <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   These tiny pears originated in Germany and the name means "trout", 
   given for the freckles which are like those of the fish. They are in 
   limited production in the Pacific Northwest but available in some 
   Southern California produce markets when in season - but they are 
   rather high priced at about 2010 US $1.99 per pound, while regular 
   pears are selling for $0.79 per pound.</p>
   <p>They start out green with red blush and freckles. The red stays but 
   the green background turns to yellow as they ripen. Green, the flesh is 
   very hard without much flavor. The photo specimens were typically 2.2 
   inches in diameter and weighed 3-3/8 ounces. Available 
   from September through February.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Red Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_prred01e.jpg" alt="Red Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   "Red Pear" can refer to red skinned varieties of a number of different 
   pears that usually appear in green or yellow. The photo specimens are 
   red d'Anjou pears. Red Bartlets exist, though I haven't yet seen them 
   in markets. They are a very brilliant red and have more of a neck than 
   the d'Anjous. A red version of the Comice was discovered in Oregon but 
   is not yet common in Southern California markets.
   <br class=cll></p>   

   <h3>Seckel Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/ro_prseckle02e.jpg" alt="Seckel Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [Sugar Pear, PLU 4422; <i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   This is the smallest of all commercial pears and also the sweetest of 
   all pears. It was discovered near Philadelphia in the 1800s, ancestry 
   unknown. These pears are green, sometimes turning yellowish when ripe 
   and often having a dark red blush - which in some cases may cover 
   the entire pear. Hard ones should be ripened at room temperature until 
   they yield slightly to pressure.  The photo specimens 
   were just under 2 inches diameter and weighed 2-1/2 ounces each, and 
   were selected for the maximum range of color. Available September 
   through February.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Tosca Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rp_prtosca02e.jpg" alt="Tosca Pears, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>P. communis</i>]
   <p>
   This pear is a recently developed cross between Coscia and Bartlet 
   (Williams bon Cretien) from Italy. It is now grown in Washington State, 
   mostly Organic, and is the first pear to ripen in that state. Flesh 
   is crisp and lightly sweet with very fine graininess. The largest of 
   the photo specimens was 2.5 inches diameter, 3.5 inches long and 
   weighed 5-5/8 ounces. The smallest in the batch was 2.1 inches 
   diameter, 2.5 inches long and weighed 2-7/8 ounces. It becomes 
   available in late August, but the photo specimens were purchased 
   in Los Angeles in late September.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Yali Pear</h3>
   <br><img src="img/pf_pryali11e.jpg" alt="Yali Pears whole and cut" class=mrg>
   [#4890, Ya Pear; Ya Li (China); China White Pear; <i>P. x bretschneideri</i> or 
   possibly a subspecies of <i>P. pyrifolia</i>]
   <p>
   This pear seems an experiment to see just how much of a fruit can be 
   water and still have crisp flesh. Eating one of these is practically 
   like eating a glass of water instead of drinking it. The flesh is, 
   however, crisp and they are moderately sweet. Unlike 
   <a href="rosepf.html#asia">Asian Pears</a> they are more pear shaped, but like 
   Asian pears, and unlike Western pears, these pears become fully ripe 
   on the tree. They are a popular crop in China, and are served raw.
   The photo specimens were about 3-1/8 inches diameter and weighted 
   about 8-5/8 ounces, purchased from a produce store in Los Angeles 
   at 2015 US $0.69 / pound, imported from China. They are available 
   in late autumn and early winter.

<h2 id="loquat">Loquat</h2>
<br><img src="img/ro_loquat03e.jpg" alt="Loquats on Tree" class=mrg>
[Nor Ashkhar (Armenian); <i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>]
<p>
Originating in southeastern China, loquats were carried to Japan in 
ancient times and are thoroughly naturalized there, where the fruit is 
very popular. Loquats are now grown in subtropical regions worldwide, 
both for fruit and as decoratives.</p>
<p> This fruit contains from one to five large shiny seeds. The seeds are 
mildly toxic with cyanide but in Japan these are used to flavor a form of 
sake with an aroma similar to apricot kernels (also laced with cyanide).
Loquat fruits are eaten fresh, made into jam, jelly and chutney, and are 
sometimes served simmered in a light syrup. They are also made into fruit 
wine and in China loquat syrup is used medicinally.</p>
<p>The photo specimens, growing on a volunteer tree at the side of my 
house, are typically 1.4 inches diameter and 1.6 inches long. The 
volunteer tree, of unknown origin, has grown large quickly and fruits 
prolifically. The tree I bought from a nursery has remained small and 
set almost no fruit until it ws over 40 years old. Loquats flower in 
the fall, with ripe fruit appearing in May.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="quince">Quince</h2>
<br><img src="img/ro_quince04e.jpg" alt="Quinces, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Cydonia oblonga</i>]
<p>
Originating probably in the Caucasus region, this fruit looks like a 
lumpy Yellow apple. Eaten raw the flesh is medium sweet and perfumy 
but coarse and more than a bit dry, so it is almost always used cooked. 
There is a sweet variety that has been eaten raw since ancient times but 
it is not available in North America.</p>
<p>The quince has been cultivated since prehistory, perhaps before 
apples. In fact the "apple" given by Paris to Aphrodite was actually a 
quince, mistranslated in later times. Actually, most "apples" in ancient 
legends are a mistranslation of quince.</p>
<p>Aside from being stewed, as was done in Roman times, it is made into 
jams and jellies, and often used to improve the flavor of applesauce and 
apple pies. With long cooking quince flesh becomes red.</p>
<p>Because of a bacterial blight problem quince is seldom grown in North 
America. Most for sale here are imported from Argentina. The photo 
specimens were 3.4 inches diameter and weighed 10-1/4 ounces.

<h2>Medlar</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_medlar01h.jpg" alt="Medlar Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Common medlar; <i>Mespilus germanica</i>]
<p>
This rather strange fruit has been cultivated in Europe since the time 
of Ancient Greece, brought from Azerbaijan about 700 BCE. The fruit is 
small, 0.8 to 1.2 inches diameter. In the far south of Europe this fruit 
ripens completely and can be eaten right off the tree, but in northern 
climates the situation is quite different - the fruit remains hard, 
acidic and high in bitter tannins.</p>
<p>To be edible, the fruit must be "bletted". This is fastest if the 
fruit has been frozen on the tree, but it will happen in storage after 
a while. The skin of the fruit becomes brown and wrinkly - the pulp 
turns brown and soft, sweet and edible, sort of like apple sauce. It 
can be spooned right out of the skin. To most people it would look 
rotten.

[Toyon, Christmas berry; <i>Heteromeles arbutifolia</i>]
<p>
This shrub, growing to 15 feet, is native to the coast of California from 
Fort Bragg down into Baja California, Mexico, and there's a strip in the 
Central Valley. It is a profuse producer of red pomes, called berries 
because of their small size (about 0.4 inch diameter). These are edible 
and can be made into jellies.</p>
<p>They were an important food for Coastal Indians. Some were eaten 
fresh, thought they tend to be sour and astringent, and were also used 
with water to make juice, but most were dried for later use in porridges 
and pancakes. You don't want to over-do them raw, because they contain 
a small amount of cyanide, which is eliminated by drying and/or cooking.

<p>
<i>A. anifolia</i> is a shrub or small tree growing to about 26 feet high. 
It is native to most of western Canada and just a bit into Alaska. It is 
also found in the northwest states down a little into California, and is 
common in North and South Dakota. It bears edible purple fruit up to 0.6 
inch diameter and is the only commercially harvested <i>Amelanchier</i>. 
The berries look a lot like the unrelated blueberries, and taste a little 
like them, with a hint of almond flavor from the seeds. Locally, the 
berries are eaten fresh or made into pies and jams.</p>
<p><i>A. lamarckii</i> is of North American origin but widely planted 
and naturalized in Europe, mostly as a decorative but also for fruit. 
It is probably a hybrid because it isn't found in the wild in North 
America. Most other <i>Amelanchier</i> species are also similarly edible.

<h2>Chokeberries / Aronia</h2>

Purple Chokeberry; <i>Aronia prunifolia</i>]
<p>
These shrubs, growing to 13 feet, are native to eastern North America, 
but at least one species is naturalized in Europe. They come in three 
colors with the purple a natural hybrid of the black and red. They 
produce pomes, called berries because of their small size, up to 0.4 
inch diameter. In Lithuania these are used to make wine, and in Poland 
they are mixed with other ingredients to make herbal teas. They are also 
used for flavoring and color in beverages and yogurt, as well as being 
baked into bread. Chokeberries should not be confused with Chokecherries 
(<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), which are <a href="rosesf.html">Stone 
Fruit</a>.</p>
<p>Black chokeberry is noted for extremely high antioxidant content, 
including polyphenols and especially anthocyanins, one of the highest 
of any fruit. Entrepreneurs have thus designated it as a "superfruit", 
targeting the ever profitable "health conscious" market in North America. 
Actual benefit to humans is conjectural at this time, but research is 
being conducted.

</p><p>
<i>Crataegus</i> Hawthorns are native to temperate zones of Europe, 
Asia and North America. <i>Rhaphiolepis</i> Hawthorns are native to 
warm and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, Japan, Korea 
and northern parts of Thailand and Vietnam. &nbsp; These genera have 
their own <a href="rp_haw.html"><b>Hawthorn / Thornapple</b></a> page.

<h2>Rowan</h2>

[Mountain Ash, Quickbeam; <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> var <i>edulis</i> 
  and other Sorbus varieties and species]<p>
This tree, which grows to 49 feet, is native to most of Europe (except 
the most southern parts), the Caucasus, Siberia and parts of North Africa.
The fruit are born in large clusters of pomes about 0.4 inch diameter. 
Fresh <i>Sorbus</i> berries are generally bitter, but can be made 
palatable by cooking into compote or made into jam, jelly, juice or 
wine or liqueur. In recent times several non-bitter cultivars have been 
found, which stands to increase the usability of this tree.  The leaves 
have been fermented along with <i>Myrica gale</i> and oak bark to 
produce an herb beer.
