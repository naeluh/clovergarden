<h1>Stone Fruit</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Peaches, Plums, Cherries and Almonds, known commonly as "Stone 
Fruits", are all members of genus <i>Prunus</i> of subfamily 
<i>Amygdaloideae</i> (formerly <i>Prunoideae</i>). The fruit of these 
roses have only a single seed, and the edible pulp is the middle layer 
of the seed surround (the mezocarp). The fleshy flower base that forms 
the edible part of an apple is entirely missing. Some species are 
harvested for their flesh and others for the seed kernels which are 
sold as "nuts".</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The largest number of <i>Prunus</i> species, and pretty much all that 
are produced commercially, are of Asian origin, though some are native 
as far west as Europe. Many were intensely cultivated in Anatolia, 
Caucasus and Western Asia in prehistoric times. They are pretty much 
all temperate climate plants. because they need winter chill in order 
to fruit.</p> 
<p>There are a number of species native to North America, and some have 
been important to American Indians, and some are eaten locally, but only 
the Beach Plum (<i>Prunus maritima</i>) is exploited commercially, and 
on a very small scale.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>Listed here are the species and varieties that are most significant 
as food. A fair number of species not listed here are eaten or made into 
jams and jellies on a local basis, but are not available in our markets 
here in Southern California.

   <h3>Almonds</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_almond01h.jpg" alt="Almond Seeds, unshelled and shelled" class=mrg>
    [<i>Prunus dulcis</i> var <i>dulcis</i> (sweet almond) | 
    <i>Prunus dulcis</i> var <i>amara</i> (bitter almond)]
    <p>
    Sold as "nuts", almonds are the pit of a peach-like fruit, but one 
    with a thin, leathery flesh.  California is by far the world's 
    leading grower and exporter of almonds, with Spain a very, very 
    distant second, trailed by Iran.</p>
    <p>Due to what many think is an over-reaction by the FDA to a 
    single US incident, all US almond nuts sold to consumers are 
    pasteurized against salmonella. Those sold as "raw" are either 
    lightly steam pasteurized or fumigated with propylene oxide. This is 
    the sort of thing that drives raw foods adherents nuts - but almond 
    farmers are allowed to sell unpasteurized nuts directly to consumers. 
    </p>
    <p>Shelled almonds are about 30 to the ounce. Bitter almonds are not 
    allowed by the FDA due to their much higher cyanide content than in 
    sweet almonds. If you need stronger almonds, use nectarine or apricot 
    pits - but use caution, they also contain more cyanide than sweet 
    almonds.
    <br class=cll></p>

    <h3>Almonds</h3> 
    
    <br><img src="img/rs_almondgn02h.jpg" alt="Almond Fruit, whole and cut" class=mrg>
    [<i>Prunus dulcis</i>]<p>
    Immature "green" almonds are favored in Persia (Iran), Armenia and 
    the Near East as a snack food. The whole fruit is eaten. It is quite 
    sour, but tempered by dipping it in sea salt. Due to our very large 
    populations from these regions, and since California is the world's 
    leading almond grower, these are plentiful when in season (late 
    April to mid June - 8 weeks at most).</p>
    <p>Bins of them will be presented in the big ethnic markets here in 
    Los Angeles. Some are exported to other parts of North America where 
    there are significant communities of the appropriate eths. They 
    should be enjoyed right after purchase, as the outer portion becomes 
    tough in a couple of days. These weighed 0.33 ounces each on average.
    </p>
    <p>Green almonds are now also favored (the seed inside only) by some 
    high priced chefs for use in expensive gourmet dishes.

   <h3>Apricot</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_apri06h.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Apricot Fruit" class=mrg>
   [zard-alu (Persia); <i>Prunus armeniaca</i>]
   <p>
   In ancient times Armenia was famous for apricots, but some hold 
   their first domestication to be farther east. In any case, 
   this fruit is still very important in Anatolia, Caucasus and Persia, 
   with Turkey the leading producer, followed (at some distance) by 
   Iran and Uzbekistan.</p>
   <p>California grows 95% of the apricots produced in North America, 
   and the variety most planted in Turkey was developed in California. 
   Fresh apricots are widely available here in California when in 
   season, but not so much elsewhere as they are quite perishable. The 
   photo shows whole, cut and dried apricots. The dried ones have 
   been treated with sulphur dioxide for color - "natural" dried 
   apricots are a very dark brownish color.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Bitter Apricots</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_apricbit06h.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Bitter Apricot Fruit" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus armeniaca</i>]
   <p>
   These are sold for uses similar to those of green almonds (see above).
   They have a pleasant sourness and the immature shell has a little 
   crunch to it. The seed is fairly bitter with a definite hint of 
   cyanide. They were about 1 inch long, purchased from a large 
   multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Black Apricot</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_apriblk02h.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Black Apricot Fruit" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus</i> hybrid]
   <p>
   This is not actually an apricot - it's a cross between an apricot 
   and a plum. As you can see, the fruit is not nearly as dry as an 
   apricot and the seed is not loose inside. This fruit may also be 
   called a plumcot, apriplum, pluot or aprium.

   <h3>Sweet Cherries</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_cherrywr15e.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Sweet Cherries" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus avium</i>]
   <p>
   Cherries are native to North America, Europe and Western Asia. They 
   grow in regions where there will be a good winter chill, so they do 
   not fruit in the tropics. Turkey is the largest producer (19%), with 
   the United States close behind and Iran trailing, and total European 
   production accounting for 40%.</p>
   <p>A number of cultivars are used to produce sweet cherries, which are 
   the cherries common in our markets when in season - and frozen out 
   of season. They fall into two general categories: "white" and "red", 
   as shown in the photo. In June they have been selling for as low as 
   2019 US $0.89 / pound in the multi-ethnic markets here in Los Angeles.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Sour Cherries</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_cherrys03h.jpg" alt="Sour Cherry Fruit with Leaves" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus cerasus</i> var <i>Amarelle</i>]
   <p>
   This cherry is used mainly for cooking, mostly in pies and pasteries. 
   It is currently of limited availability here in Los Angeles - and at 
   a rather high price, but for many uses there is no substitute. They 
   are a bit smaller and more uniformly spherical than the common sweet 
   cherries. Most common in North America is the Montmorency variety, 
   grown in Canada, France and the U.S. States of Michigan and Wisconsin.

   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Morello Cherries</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_chmorel02h.jpg" alt="Morello Cherries with syrup" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus cerasus</i> var <i>Morello</i>]
   <p>
   This is a small European sour cherry, of darker color than the 
   <i>Amarelle</i> variety common in North America. They are available 
   here mainly as "compote" or preserves, usually sold at a premium price. 
   The photo specimens were from Bulgaria, in size up to 0.75 inch. 
   Ingredients: Morello cherries with pits, water, sugar.  One of my 
   favorite markets had piles of 24 ounce jars, both pit in and pitted 
   at 2013 US $1.49 per jar. Naturally, at that price, I bought plenty.

   [Bird Cherry: Mahlab, Mahleb (Mid East, Anatolia, Armenia); Mahlepi 
   (Greek); St Lucie Cherry, Mahaleb Cherry; <i>Prunus mahaleb</i>]
   <p>
   This cherry tree is native from central and southern Europe east to 
   Pakistan and Kyrgystan, and south to Morocco and Lebanon. It produces 
   small red cherries that are thin fleshed and bitter, eaten mainly by 
   birds. The cherry pits are broken open to release the kernel, which is 
   used as a spice for holiday sweets and cakes, particularly in Greece, 
   Turkey, Armenia, Cyprus, Lebanon. Syria and Iraq. It is also used to 
   flavor Nabulsi cheese.</p>
   <p>It is described as tasting like a combination of cherry and bitter 
   almond. Myself I don't detect much cherry, but it has a moderately 
   bitter aromatic resin taste. The specimen photo shows seed kernels 
   0.2 inch (5 mm) long purchased from a market in Los Angeles. It 
   is more available in powdered form, but that must be fresh as it 
   degrades rapidly.

      Native to the United States east of the Mississippi and extending 
      into Texas, and in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala, this tree 
      can grow to about 100 feet high. It produces cherries about 0.38 
      inch diameter with a single seed. The seed kernel and other parts 
      of the plant  produce copious cyanide, but the fruit flesh is safe 
      to eat. The fruit is used to make jams and cherry pies, but is most 
      noted as a flavoring for liqueurs, sodas and ice cream, as well as 
      being used in cocktails and dark chocolate cakes.

      <p>
      Native to central United States through central Canada from 
      coast to coast, this was the most important edible fruit to the 
      American Indians of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Planes, and much 
      of Canada. The fruit can be used to make jams and jellies, but needs 
      a fair amount of sugar due to bitterness. The foliage is laced with 
      cyanide, especially when wilted, and is toxic to livestock (and 
      people). This fruit should not be confused with Chokeberries 
      (<i>Aronia</i> species) which are <a href="rosepf.html">Pome 
      Fruits</a>.

      <p>
      <i>P. grayana</i> is a small tree, growing to 65 feet, native to 
      China and Japan. It is very closely related to <i>P. padus</i>. 
      The small fruit, about 0.3 inch diameter, starts green, then turns 
      red and finally black when fully ripe. The flowers and fruit are 
      edible, and unlike many cherries, the seed kernels are edible. 
      In Japan, the fruit is often preserved in salt.</p>
      <p><i>P. padus</i> is a small tree, growing to around 50 feet, 
      native to northern Europe and Asia and south to Ukraine. The small 
      black fruit is somewhat astringent and seldom eaten in Western 
      Europe, but is eaten in Eastern Europe and Asia. I don't know if 
      the seed kernel is edible as it is with <i>P. grayana</i>.

   <p>
   Native to the coastal chaparral of California, from Monterey south 
   into northern Baja, this shrub or small tree, growing to 30 feet, 
   has been cultivated for hundreds of years for its fruit. The purple 
   to black fruit, up to almost an inch in diameter, is sweet, with 
   moderately thick flesh around a single pit. The fruit can be eaten 
   out of hand, but the Coastal Indians liked to ferment it into an 
   intoxicating beverage. This is a popular and decorative landscaping 
   plant in coastal California.

<h2 id="peach" class=lrg>Peaches <small>&amp;</small> Nectarines</h2>

<p>Peaches and Nectarines are of the same species, <i>Prunus persica</i>,

   <h3>Peaches, Common</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_peachwy05h.jpg" alt="Peaches, Whole &amp; Cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus persica</i>]
   <p>
   Peaches originated in China, and have been in cultivation there for 
   more than 4000 years. In ancient times they were taken to India 
   and Western Asia. They were taken from Persia to Greece during the 
   time of Alexander, and were grown extensively in Italy during the 
   Roman Empire. Today China grows over 50% the world's production 
   of peaches and nectarines, with Italy second at 7.7%. </p>
   <p>Many cultivars are grown, including "yellow" and "white" varieties. 
   The flesh of white peaches vary from nearly white to light yellow, 
   while regular peaches are intensely yellow. Some varieties are 
   "freestone", with an easily removed seed, but others are "clingstone", 
   with a seed very tightly bound to the flesh. Clingstones ripen early 
   in the season and are the major versions for processing and canning. 
   Freestones come later in the season and are the most common varieties 
   in the markets. They tend to be larger, firmer and less juicy than 
   clingstones, but are still quite sweet. They work well for canning 
   and baking.</p>
   <p>The photo shows white peaches to the left and yellow peaches to 
   the right. Both were about 3.3 inches diameter and weighed about 
   9-3/4 ounces, near the high end for size and weight. The yellow are 
   significantly jucier, sweeter and have more intense peach flavor than 
   the white, but the white can be cut more neatly and are reported to be 
   higher in vitamins. Both specimens were obviously "freestone" 
   varieties.

   Nectarines are the same species as peaches and vary only in having 
   smooth skins instead of fuzzy. As with peaches, China grows over 50% 
   the world's production</p>
   <p>Like peaches, nectarines come in "yellow" and "white" varieties, 
   and "freestone" and "clingstone". The photo specimens are a "white" 
   variety.

   Why something that's really just a curiosity is so common in my local 
   markets here in Los Angeles is a mystery to me. They are generally 
   considerably more expensive than regular peaches, have a lot less 
   flesh per unit, and, in my opinion, generally don't taste as good. 
   They come in yellow and white versions of both peaches and nectarines.

   only seen them once, in September 2014. They were freestone, had good 
   plum flavor and texture, and excellent flesh to seed ratio.</p>
   <p>The tiny plums I have no photo of, because I saw them only once 
   many years before I started this Web site in 2004. They were purple 
   plums that tasted fine, but had an unusual side effect which may have 
   caused them to disappear from the market. Under the influence of these 
   plums I let by far the longest and most luxurious fart of my entire 
   life! I went out on the back porch to enjoy this event in private, 
   but was reminded of a nearby open window with an assistant working 
   on the computer just inside - when I heard shrieks of laughter 
   coming from within.

   <h3>Sugar Plums</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_pmsug01e.jpg" alt="Sugar Plums, Whole &amp; Cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus domestica</i> var <i>sugar</i>]
   <p>
   These are not the Sugar Plums of the Christmas story, which were 
   hard candies with a spice seed or nut in the center. These trees 
   were brought from Europe in colonial days and are still popular, 
   especially with homeowners who need a small self pollinating fruit 
   tree. The plums are "snack size" and quite sweet. They have a small, 
   rather flat seed. The photo specimens were typically 1.8 inches 
   long, 1.1 inches diameter and weighed around 3/4 ounce. They were 
   purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) 
   in July 2019.
   <br class=cll></p>


   <h3>Sour Plums</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_sourplum04e.jpg" alt="Sour Plums, Whole &amp; Cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus domestica</i>]
   <p>
   These unripe plums are sold as "sour plums" here in Los Angeles, 
   when they are in season. They are not identical to the sour plums 
   of the Caucasus, which remain sour when mature, but they are very 
   popular here anyway. Several of the multi-ethnic markets here in 
   Los Angeles have piles of them in June. They weigh about 1/2 ounce 
   each and average about 1-1/4 inches diamtere. They make a good tart 
   snack just eaten out of hand. I have recently purchased them for 
   2019 US $1.99 / pound.

   <h3>Cherry Plum</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_chrplm01h.jpg" alt="Cherry Plum Branch with Fruit" class=mrg>
   [Myrobalan plum, Sour Plums; Tkemali (Georgian); <i>Prunus 
   cerasifera</i>]
   <p>
   This small tree, growing to 49 feet high, is native to Europe and 
   Asia, but has escaped cultivation in North America and is now found 
   in the wild. It is a widely planted decorative, and a number of  
   cultivars have been developed with red or purple leaves.  The edible 
   fruit is between 3/4 to 1-1/8 inch diameter - the fruit in the photo 
   is not yet ripe, so is quite green. Flower and fruit color varies with 
   cultivar, with fruit ranging from green through red to very deep 
   purple. Edibility also varies with cultivar, ranging from sweet and 
   edible out of hand to rather tart, best for making jams and jellies.</p> 
   <p>These small plums, in both red and green colors, are very important 
   in Georgia (former Soviet Republic of), much used for making tkemali 
   sauce, "ketchup of the Caucasus". Some sweeter plums may be mixed 
   in to make a less tart sauce.  Examples found in Los Angeles ethnic 
   markets are commonly made in Russia. These plums are occasionally 
   available dried, seed in, made from a green variety, in ethnic markets 
   serving a Caucasus community. See "Prunes" below.

   <h3>Cherry Plum - Dried</h3>
   <br><img src="img/rs_plmchry01e.jpg" alt="Dried Cherry Plums" class=mrg>
   [Myrobalan plum, Sour Plums; <i>Prunus cerasifera</i>]
   <p>
   These are Cherry Plums as described above, but dried whole. They 
   were probably between .75 and 1.13 inch diameter when picked, but 
   dried are between 0.44 and 0.64 inch. Much of that size is taken up 
   by a fairly large seed. The see at the lower right corner of the 
   photo is from one of the larger ones.</p>
   <p>These are a snack item - you just toss one in you mouth and 
   scrape the flesh off the seed with your teeth. The taste is intense, 
   and quite a bit more sour than the regular prunes we have here in 
   North America. These were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
   in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2019 US $4.99 / pound, in one pound 
   bags. Product of Tajikistan, where plums are becoming a major 
   cash crop.

   <h3>Prunes <small>&amp;</small> Dried Plums</h3> 
   <br><img src="img/rs_plum07e.jpg" alt="Prunes, Whole &amp; Cut" class=mrg>
   [<i>Prunus domestica</i> | <i>Prunus cerasifer</i> (sour plums)]
   <p>
   Prunes are used in cooking throughout Europe, from the British Isles 
   through the Caucasus, and in North America for recipes originating 
   from that region. They need to be soaked for about an hour before 
   using. Prunes are also used as a snack, and sometimes to aid in 
   "regularity". In North America black prunes dominate, and they are 
   almost always seeded. Dried sour plums are generally seed in.</p>
   <p>The photo shows fresh plums at the top, black prunes made from 
   similar plums in the middle, and dried sour plums along the bottom. 
   Those to the left (lighter color) are treated with sulphur dioxide, 
   and those to the right (darker color) are not.

   [Chinese Plum, Japanese Apricot; meihua (China); Hiragana (Japan); 
   <i>Prunus mume</i>]
   <p>
   This is more an apricot than a plum, but it's so commonly called a 
   plum we have entered it here. This is a very important fruit in 
   China, Korea and Japan, not often eaten fresh but made into many 
   different products, including plum sauce, plum wine and umeboshi 
   (Japanese pickled plums). The Umeboshi in the photo were about 1 
   inch long.  These plum products have their own

   <p>[Blood Plum; <i>Prunus salicina</i>]
   </p><p>
   This plum, native to China, is now grown in Japan, Korea, Australia 
   and the United States. It has been extensively used as hybridization 
   stock to develop other important plum varieties.	 In China, candied 
   fruits are made flavored with salt, sugar and liquorice. In Japan, 
   half ripe fruit are used to flavor an alcoholic beverage called 
   <i>sumomo shu</i>. It is also used to make alcoholic beverages in 
   China. The fruits are between 1-1/2 and 2-3/4 inches diameter, and 
   can be eaten out of hand.

   [<i>Prunus domestica</i> subsp. <i>syriaca</i>]
   <p>
   Originating in Anatolia or Caucasus, this small oval plum is now a 
   specialty of France. Though these plums are fine eating, nearly all 
   are made into jam or used for  eu-de-vie brandy. In Romania these 
   plums are popular for eating unripe when they are crisp and sour.

   <p>
   In the late 1700s these small green plums were widely grown in the 
   American Colonies / States, but they are not common here now. They 
   are widely grown in Europe, typically for stewing into compote.

   [<i>Prunus maritima</i>]
   <p>
   This shrub, up to 6 feet tall, is native to the east coast of the 
   United States from Maine to Maryland. The fruit is reasonably 
   sweet and can be eaten out of hand, but is only 5/8 to 3/4 inch 
   diameter. It is often made into jam or wine. It is produced 
   commercially on a small scale, with development of varieties with 
   larger fruit in progress.

   [<i>Prunus domestica</i> subsp. <i>insititia</i>]
   <p>
   These small oval plums are most grown in England. The skins are quite 
   sour, so the main use is for making jams and jellies. They are also 
   used to make damson gin, similar to sloe gin. There is a white version, 
   but it is now very rare.

   <p>
   These small spherical plums are closely related to the Damson Plum, 
   but much smaller. They are most grown in England where both black 
   and white varieties are found. They are quite sour until fully 
   ripe, when they can be eaten fresh, but they are more used for making 
   jams and jellies. In the past they were fermented into wine and 
   used to make pies.

   <p>
   Not strictly a plum, but closely related, this berry is native to 
   Europe, Western Asia and a few locations in North Africa. Berries 
   are almost black and less than 1/2 inch in diameter. It's most famous 
   use is to be steeped in gin and sugar to make sloe gin, a deep red 
   liqueur. the berries can also be made into jams and jellies, and 
   if pickled in vinegar, are similar to Japanese umiboshi. In England 
   and Central Europe they are also fermented into wine.

   <p>
   While there are a few isolated populations in Mexico, this small tree, 
   growing to 38 feet, is most common from Missouri to eastern Texas 
   and east to Alabama, but not continuously. The fruit, dark red to 
   purple, is about 1 inch diameter and may range from sour to sweet. 
   It is said to make exceptionally good jelly, is eaten raw or cooked 
   and made into wine and brandy.  The seed kernels and leaves are high 
   in cyanide and should not be eaten.
