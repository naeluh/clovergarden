<p>
Here we have a case where who eats and who is eaten is unusually 
interchangeable. It pays to be alert and careful when hiking in 
Alligator territory.</p>

<p>Alligators are now known not to be reptiles, but related to birds 
through a common dinosaur ancestor. Nonetheless, we're listing them 
here under "reptiles" rather than under "birds", because this is where 
most people would expect to find them.</p>

<p>American alligators are found in the southeast of the U.S. from North 
Carolina down and around Florida to the coastal areas of Texas, but most 
live in Florida and Louisiana. The largest alligator on record was over 
19 feet but they are commonly around 8 feet.</p>
<p>While the American Alligator is doing well and is also extensively 
farmed, the Chinese alligator lives only along the Yangtze River and is 
endangered. In the U.S. alligator has been harvested primarily for hides 
but the meat is becoming increasingly popular.

No, Alligator doesn't taste "just like chicken", but close enough to 
chicken thighs that recipes calling for alligator should work well 
enough with them. Perhaps wigh a little marinade of Thai fish sauce. 
Young alligator (the only kind available around here) leg meat is a 
little milder than chicken thighs but has more flavor than breast, 
and it's less tough and stringy than chicken. The photo to the left is 
of Alligator Tail Meat (previously frozen).</p>

<p>I've found that frozen alligator meat (again, the only kind available 
around here) exudes a lot of juices when fried. The juices coagulate on 
the pan and form a thick brown coating which would burn before the pieces 
of meat were browned. You could probably brown alligator by par boiling 
it for a couple of minutes, cooling, drying and then frying,  but 
browning isn't necessary for most recipes.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Alligator meat is not yet common in much of 
the U.S., but in Los Angeles I've found it occasionally in large Asian 
markets serving a mixed Chinese and Vietnamese community, and it is 
also stocked by Harmony Farms, the exotic meat market down the street 
from me. The tail meat pictured to the left cost 2019 US $23 / pound.
