<h1>Frog</h1>
<br><img src="img/rp_frog08g.jpg" alt="Live Frog" class=mrg>
[family <i>Ranidae</i> (true frogs) mostly genus <i>Rana</i> (over 230 
species)]
<p>
While one species of frog (<i>Conraua goliath</i>) can grow to 7 
pounds, the edible frogs of commerce are generally less than 1 pound. 
While frog eating is commonly associated with France, they are much more 
commonly eaten in the U.S. South and Midwest, the Caribbean, Argetina, 
Uruguay, Africa, China and Southeast Asia. In most cases only the hind 
legs are eaten though in some areas for some species the back is also 
used.</p>
<p> Frozen frog legs from China and Vietnam are now common in North 
American markets serving local Asian communities. In Europe the most 
eaten frog is the Edible Frog (<i>Rana kl. esculenta</i>). In the North 
American the most eaten frog is the American Bull Frog (<i>Rana 
catesbeiana</i>), a very large frog that can grow to 1.5 pounds and is 
farmed in some regions.  &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

So, does frog really taste "just like chicken"?  Well, only if one of 
your chicken's grandmothers was messing around with a fish - it has just 
a faint suggestion of fish flavor. The flesh is mild and less stringy 
than chicken, more like Alligator, actually.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While frog and frog legs have long been available 
in the American South (Louisiana, and around there) and in certain parts 
of the Midwest, they are now easily available wherever there is a 
substantial Chinese or Southeast Asian community. Asian legs are from 
aquaculture frogs which are somewhat lighter in flavor than wild frogs 
and less likely to carry salmonella and parasites.

<p>Frog legs are generally sold by count - how many pairs makes a pound. 
Counts range from 2/4 for the largest and 16/20 for the smallest but 4/6 
and 6/8 are the most common ranges.  In some regions the legs will have 
the backbone and back muscles attached to the legs ("saddle on"), but 
those from Asia do not.</p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken wings, two largest joints (skin them).
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh frog legs should be eaten within 2 days. 
Frozen they can be safely kept for 6 months.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If you buy your frog legs frozen, they're cleaned, 
skinned and ready to go. You may wish to cut the pairs into individual 
legs which makes cooking easier, and you may wish to cut off the bony 
feet. Soak small legs in several changes of water. If the legs are large 
scald them about 2 minutes in boiling salted water acidulated with lemon 
juice (1/4 cup per quart) or citric acid.

<p>If you caught your own frogs, you'll have to cut out the legs and skin 
them. Frog is never cooked "skin-on" and the skin is sometimes toxic.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Frog cooks quite quickly, 20 to 30 minutes at a 
simmer depending on size. When it is done the legs will separate into 
separate joints and the meat will start to fall off the bones.<p></p>
