<h1>Hawthorn / Thornapple</h1>
<br>[May-tree, Whitethorn, Hawberry; Genus <i>Crataegus</i> 
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; Genus <i>Rhaphiolepis</i>]
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
We have combined two genera of plants on this page because they are 
both called "Hawthorn", are closely related and similarly used. Hawthorn 
fruits are pommes, similar to apples, but are called "berries" because 
of their small size. Ripe fruit is most often red, but orange, yellow, 
purple and black fruited species exist. Most hawthorn fruits are edible, 
but many aren't worth the bother due to small size and/or deficient 
flavor.	 Some locally eaten species are not listed here due to obscurity.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><i>Crataegus</i> Hawthorns are native to temperate zones of Europe, 
Asia and North America.  This genus is suspected to have about 200 
species, but nobody knows for sure. Most of the edible hawthorns are 
in this genus. Young leaves can be picked in the spring and used in 
salads.</p>
<p><i>Rhaphiolepis</i> Hawthorns are native to warm and subtropical 
regions of Asia, particularly China, Japan, Korea and northern parts of 
Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. This genus includes about 15 species. It 
is closely related to the Loquats - so closely hybrids exist. One that 
is well known is the Bronze Loquat, noted for "tasty but inedible fruit" 
(the flesh over the seeds is very thin).</p> 

<p>Hawthorn produces very hard wood. It is the only proper wood from which 
to make effective vampire slaying stakes (Croatia, Serbia). It has many 
other magical properties as well.</p>

<p>In northwestern Europe hawthorn is associated with fairies, and it is 
considered bad luck to cut one down. Cutting down an old hawthorn to make 
way for its production facility has been proposed as the source of bad 
luck encountered by the De Lorean Motor Company. There are many other 
folklore associations with this small tree, including that it was used 
to make Jesus' crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Hawthorns, which grow throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, 
are particularly associated with spring, because many varieties bloom in 
May. Fruits and various other parts of the tree have long been used 
medicinally, notably for cardiac and digestive problems. Modern 
scientific study is being conducted with some early positive indications.
</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Chinese Hawthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_hawc03h.jpg" alt="Preserved Chinese Hawthorn Fruit" class=mrg>
[Shanzha (China), <i>Crataegus pinnatifida</i>]
<p>
Fruit from this small to medium tree is widely used in northern China, 
both for food and medicinal purposes.  They are made into jams, jellies, 
candy, wine and other alcoholic beverages. Notable is the traditional 
"haw flakes", a dried fruit candy formed into a thin disk about 1 inch 
diameter.</p>
<p>The photo shows cored fruit from China that had been preserved in a 
light syrup. About 0.9 inch diameter, they were mildly tart with a flavor 
reminiscent of lightly cooked apple and pear.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Common Hawthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_hawcm01e.jpg" alt="Common Hawthorn Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Haw; <i>Crataegus monogyna</i>]
<p>
This shrub or small tree is native to Europe, northwest Africa and 
western Asia but has been introduced to many other parts of the world, where 
it can easily become a pest. The fruits are about 0.4 inch diameter and are 
edible raw, cooked or made into jams, jelly or fruit preserves. Flower petals 
and young leaves are also edible. It is used medicinally to strengthen cardiac 
function.

<h2>Tejocote</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_tejcot04e.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Tejocote Fruits" class=mrg>
[Mexican Hawthorn; Manzanita, Tejocotera; <i>Crataegus mexicana</i>]
<p>
Native to the mountains of Mexico and parts of Guatemala, this small 
tree has been introduced to other parts of the Andes range. In Mexico 
it is the main ingredient in <i>ponche</i>, the fruit punch served hot 
at Christmas and New Years. The flesh is fairly dry and lightly sweet. 
It tastes similar to apple, but more intense, sort of like partially 
dried apple. They are edible raw or cooked, but cooking brings out more 
flavor.The fruit is used as offerings to the dead and to make various 
types of candy. Roots and fruit are also used medicinally.</p>
<p>This fruit is very high in pectin, which is industrially extracted 
for food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and industrial uses. 
The photo specimens, purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles were up to 1.6 diameter 1.5 inches long and weighed just 
over 1 ounce each, unusually large for tejocote. The fresh fruit is 
still an exotic here, and these sold for 2014 US $7.49 / pound. I 
have purchased somewhat smaller ones at a farmer's market at about 
the same price.

<h2>Mayhaw</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_mayhaw01k.jpg" alt="Live Mayhaw Leaves" class=mrg>
[Eastern May Hawthorn; <i>Crataegus aestivalis</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Western May Hawthorn; <i>Crataegus opaca</i>]
<p>
Native to wet regions of the southeastern United States 
(<i>C. aestivalis</i>) and the Texas / Louisiana border region 
(<i>C. opaca</i>), the fruits of these small trees were formally 
harvested from shallow boats, but today this has declined due to 
destruction of wetlands. They are now being cultivated outside the 
wetlands making them more available.</p>
<p>The primary use of this fruit is the making of a jelly that is 
considered a highly desirable delicacy in the region.

<h2>Oriental Hawthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_hawor01h.jpg" alt="Oriental Hawthorn Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Eastern Thorn, Silver Thorn Tree;  <i>Crataegus orientalis</i>]
<p>
Native to the Mediterranean, Anatolia, Caucasus, Crimea and western Iran, 
this hawthorn has larger fruits than most, up to 0.8 inch diameter. These 
fruits are eaten raw, and in the Caucasus are baked in bread. This tree is 
also used medicinally.

[Redhaw Hawthorn, <i>Crataegus sanguinea</i>]
<p>
This hawthorn is native to Siberia, Mongolia, and the extreme north of 
China. The fruits, about 0.4 inch diameter with up to 5 large seeds, 
are eaten raw and cooked, and used to make jams, jellies and fruit 
preserves.

<br><img src="img/rp_hawaz01e.jpg" alt="Unripe Azarole Fruit" class=mrg>
[Mosphilla, Mediterranean Medlar; Zalzalak (Iran); <i>Crataegus 
azarolus</i>]
<p>
This tree is native from the Mediterranean basin to Iran, where it is called 
zalzalak, with the same name applied to a jam made from the fruit. 
The photo is of unripe fruit, which, when mature, will be about 0.75 inch 
diameter and red in color.

<h2>Yun Nan Shan Zha</h2>
<br class=cll>
<img src="img/rp_haws03e.jpg" alt="Dried Yunan Shan Zha Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Crataegus scabrifolia</i>]
<p>
This hawthorn grows in wet mountain regions of southern China, mostly 
Yunan, but a few in western Guizhou and southern Guangxi. Red or yellow 
fruits are large for a hawthorn, up to 1 inch diameter, and sold fresh 
in local markets. While the fruits are eaten, raw or cooked, its main 
uses are medicinal, usually dried. It can be found in the medicinal herbs 
sections of the large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. Hawthorn is used 
mainly for lowering blood pressure and is sold by North American 
supplement vendors.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Indian Hawthorn</h2>
<br><img src="img/rp_hawind01h.jpg" alt="Indian Hawthorn Fruit on Shrub" class=mrg>
[<i>Rhaphiolepis indica</i>]<p>
This shrub is native to southern China, Japan, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand 
and Vietnam.  It is commonly grown for its copious bright pink flowers, 
but the fruit is edible when cooked, usually made into jam.
