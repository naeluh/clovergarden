[Green Iguana <i>Iguana iguana</i>]
<p>
The Green Iguana is native to Central and South America and the Caribbean 
Islands and grows to 6 feet long and over 10 pounds. Iguanas hatched in 
captivity make good pets <b>if given proper care and feeding</b> which 
may not be easy in non-tropical locations. Wild iguanas seldom survive in 
captivity.</p>
<p>While green iguanas are eaten in Central and South America, they are 
CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) listed 
as Appendix II "threatened" so I have recommend against eating them, but 
see the Puerto Rico situation below. They should not be purchased as pets 
unless their fairly demanding care and feeding needs can be met - for a 
period of 20 years or more.

<p>I have not eaten Iguana because it is CITES (Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species) listed as Appendix II 
"threatened" so I'm not providing any instructions here. Besides, it's 
said that it "tastes like chicken", just like every other weird critter 
is said to taste like.</p>

<p>While these lizards are now not so common in Central and South America 
where they are prized for culinary, medicinal, and magical purposes, that 
is not the case in Puerto Rico. They are not native to Puerto Rico, 
but in the 1970s, pets escaped or were released. They are now a plague 
on the land.</p>

<p>Problem is, Puerto Ricans can't even imagine eating iguana. To solve 
the problem, the government is hoping to build an export market for them. 
I have learned of one exotic meat vendor in California who is definitely 
interested in importing them. He says he can sell plenty, particularly 
due to the reputed aphrodisiac properties of iguana meat.</p>
