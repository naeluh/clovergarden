[genus <i>Crotalus</i>, (27 species), also genus <i>Sistrurus</i> (3 species)]
<p>
Rattlesnakes are native to North and South America and are among the most 
venomous snakes in the world. Some species can grow to more than 8 feet long 
but the famous Western Diamondback rarely exceeds 6 feet. Rattlesnakes figure 
in the cuisines of the U.S. Southwest and Mexico and are available from 
specialty meat stores, and I've seen them in at least one of the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles. The flavor is similar to a free range chicken 
thigh but chewier.
