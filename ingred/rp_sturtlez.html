<h1>Sea Turtles</h1>

[family <i>Cheloniidae</i> (5 species), family <i>Dermochelyidae</i> (one 
species, Leatherbacks (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>))]
<p>
Sea turtles are land reptiles that have returned to the sea, but adult females 
travel to the sandy beach where they hatched to lay their eggs above the high 
tide mark. This is often a trip of thousands of miles from the foraging 
grounds. Baby turtles, after hatching, head immediately for the sea, but are 
extremely vulnerable to predation by land animals. Once in the sea they are 
extremely vulnerable to predation by sharks. Those that make it through this 
experience (about 1%) may live long lives if not accidently caught and 
drowned by fishing gear.</p>
<p><b>All sea turtles are Internationally listed as "Endangered" or 
"Threatened"</b> and protected by national laws and international treaties. 
They should not be disturbed, captured or eaten, nor should their nests and 
eggs be disturbed. All sea turtles in U.S. waters are protected by the 
Endangered Species Act which establishes substantial penalties for placing 
them at risk.

<p>It is not legal to eat sea turtles in the U.S. or to bring into the 
country products derived from sea turtles. Many other countries have 
similar bans.</p>

<p>Green Sea Turtle was long used to make the famous turtle soup, but you 
must now be satisfied with <a href="../recipes/1om_mockturt1.html"><b>Mock 
Turtle Soup</b></a> (and without even real mock turtles). Sea Turtle was 
an essential ingredient in the Mexican <i>caldo de siete mares</i> 
(seven seas soup) which is the only place I have eaten it. I can't tell 
you anything about the taste because that was well before the ban, 
an uncountable number of years ago.</p>
