[Family <i>Emydidae</i> Common Box Turtle, <i>Terrapene carolina</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; Asian box turtles, family <i>Geoemydidae</i>]
<p>
The Chinese, having eaten their own box turtles to the verge of extinction 
are now determined to do the same to ours. At least one Asian market 
in Los Angeles has these for sale live as "hard shell turtle".

<p>I do not object to the sale of these turtles for eating in North 
America, not very many will be sold here, but in my opinion all exports 
to China and other Asian countries should be halted until sustainability 
of the population is established or turtle farms are in operation. 
Populations of these turtles are listed as "Vulnerable".</p>
