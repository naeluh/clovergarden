[family <i>Trionychidae</i>;  Florida Soft Shell Turtle, 
<i>Apalone ferox</i>]
<p>
The Chinese, having eaten their own soft shell turtles to the verge of 
extinction are now determined to do the same to ours. At least one Asian 
market in Los Angeles has these for sale live as "soft shell turtle".

<p><p>Florida soft shell turtles are quite large, with males growing to 14 
inches and 10 pounds while females grow to 30 inches and over 44 pounds. 
Those I've seen for sale here in Los Angeles have a shell length of about 
13 inches.

<p>I do not object to the sale of these turtles for eating in North 
America, not very many will be sold here, but exports to China and other 
Asian countries should be watched closely to assure sustainability of 
the population. Populations of these turtles are currently listed as 
"Least Concern".</p>
