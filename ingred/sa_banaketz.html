This product, very popular in the Philippines, is called "Banana Ketchup" 
there, but in the United States it must be labeled "Banana Sauce". In 
the U.S. "Ketchup" is a standardized formula and nothing that doesn't 
meet the formula can be called "Ketchup". This was done so 
manufacturers of ketchup didn't have to reveal its extremely high sugar 
content (more sugar than ice cream - that's why the kids like it so much).
</p>
<p>Banana Ketchup is colored red and put up in ketchup style bottles to 
make it more acceptable as a lower cost ketchup substitute. The taste and 
texture are a little different from our ketchup, but not too much. 
Ingred (UFC Brand): banana, water, sugar, vinegar, iodized salt, modified 
starch, onion, spices, garlic, 0.08% sodium benzoate (E211) as 
preservative, FD&amp;C Yellow #6 (E110) and FD&amp;C Red #40 (E129) as 
artificial coloring.</p>
