This is actually the same as Bouillon Cubes, but in powdered form, so 
you could substitute an equivalent amount of crushed Bouillon Cubes. 
East and Southeast Asia recipes depend a lot of chicken stock being 
continuously available, but that isn't always practical in this day when 
servants and stay at home cooks are increasingly scarce. This is 
particularly so for Southeast Asians now living in North America. This 
has made Chicken Powder an essential ingredient for cobbling up small 
amounts of stock quickly. Due to it's common availability it has also 
found use as a general seasoning.</p>
<p>Some of the Asian brands are entirely artificial, completely 
unrelated to actual chickens, so might be of interest to vegetarians. 
It is a good idea to read the ingredients list before purchasing. We 
favor Knorr and Lee Kum Kee brands, which have some actual chicken 
products in them. The photo example, purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles, was Product of USA, distributed by Unilever Canada. 
&nbsp;  Ing: salt, monosodium glutamate, corn syrup solids, dried chicken 
meat, corn starch, chicken fat, sugar, hydrolized soy protein, hydrolized 
corn protein, calcium silicate (anticaking agent), natural and artificial 
flavors (egg), yeast extract (barley), hydrolized wheat protein, 
disodium guanylate, disodium inosinate, tapioca dextrin, dextrose, 
disodium phosphate, autolyzed yeast extract, spices, maltodextrin, whey 
(milk), caramel color, modified corn starch, onion powder.  The 
Lee Kum Kee product appeared to have been made the same, probably in the 
same factory.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found this in the large Asian 
markets here in Los Angles. Apparently it is expected to be used quite 
often, because the store had only the 2.2 pound (1 kg) size in Knorr, 
Lee Kum Kee and other brands. The Knorr cost 2017 US $7.99 for the 
2.2 pound can. Knorr products are widely distributed and probably 
available even in regular supermarkets.<p></p>

<h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; One slightly rounded teaspoon per cup of 
boiling water. Adjust to taste.<p></p>
