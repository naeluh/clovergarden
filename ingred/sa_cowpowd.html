<p>[Beef Flavored Broth Mix]

This is actually the same as Bouillon Cubes, but in powdered form, so 
you could substitute an equivalent amount of crushed Bouillon Cubes. 
Bouillon mixes of this sort are much used in regions of the world that 
have inadequate refrigeration to hold stocks beyond the day made. A home 
made beef stock is always the best substitute.</p>
<p>Ing: salt, monosodium glutamate, corn starch, sugar, palm oil 
and factionated palm oil, natrual flavor, powdered cooked beef, silicon 
dioxide (prevents caking), caramel color (contains sulfites), yeast 
extract, disodium guanylate, disodium inosinate, maltodextrin, dehydrated 
parsley, turmeric (color), lactic acid, spice, thiamine hydrochloride.</p>
