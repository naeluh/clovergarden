<p>
Ketchup is held in high favor by children, because it has more sugar 
than ice cream - it's sort of tomato flavored candy. By federal law, 
if your product doesn't have that much sugar it can't be called 
"ketchup". When Trader Joe's sold a "no added sugar" ketchup, thay 
had to lable it "Ketchy".</p>
<p>This was a ploy by the food industry to "standardize" the product 
so they didn't have to reveal on the label that it was about 1/3 sugar 
(other ingredients are water, salt, vinegar, spices, and, yes, tomatoes). 
The problem: sugar is not only empty calories, it's known to be damaging 
to the body in many ways. Some researchers consider it to be an 
addictive drug, so exposing the high sugar content could have impacted 
ketchup sales. I suggest you keep your children away from ketchup as 
much as from candy and other unhealthy sugary sweets.</p>
<p>Back in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was president, his administration 
was trying to find more money to give to the rich ("tinkle down 
economics"). His budget director, David Stockman, proposed classifying 
ketchup as a vegetable to cut down the cost of vegetables in federally 
funded school lunch programs. The proposal leaked out and was so roundly 
ridiculed the administration had to withdraw it.</p>
<p><p>"Ketchup" (variously spelled), is an Asian word for sauces with a 
high sugar content. Originally, none were made from tomatoes, because 
they didn't have tomatoes, though mushrooms were a popular ingredient.
Tukas brand, made in Turkey but sold here in Los Angeles, does not 
strictly adhere to the formula, so they spell it in Turkish, 
"Ket&ccedil;". Of course they then have to list the ingredients: Tomato 
Pur&eacute;e, Glucose Syrup (a form of 
sugar), Sugar, Vinegar, Salt, Corn Starch, Spice Extracts.  Note that 
splitting sugar into two forms is a standard industry trick used to 
prevent "sugar" from being the top ingredient.</p>
