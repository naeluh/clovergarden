[<i>Pun daeng</i> (Thai, red); Calcium Hydroxide, (Ca(OH)2)]
<p>
Lime is used in Thailand to produce crisper, longer lasting batters on 
fruits and other deep fried items. It is also used in pickling, and has 
long been so used in the West, to make pickles more crisp.</p>

<p>Use for pickling is no longer recommended. If the cucumbers are not 
very thoroughly washed after treatment, it can result in botulism 
infection, often resulting in death. The cause is decreasing the acidity 
of the pickling liquid.</p>

<p>This lime can be found in pink and white versions. The traditional 
pink color comes from it's use in Betel chews, an addictive, and probably 
carcinogenic, stimulant. The color comes from addition of Turmeric.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo examples were purchased from a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), from up on a high shelf. It 
can also be purchased on-line.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; With long storage, these pastes will dry out, 
but can be re-constituted by adding water and letting soak for awhile.
Essentially, they will last forever.<p></p>

<h3>Lime Water:</h3> &nbsp; Mix 1 Tablespoon paste to 2-1/2 cups of 
water. let stand for at least 30 minutes, after which time the solids 
should sink to the bottom. Pour off the clear liquid as needed for use 
in recipes.

<p>Lime Water should be stored in a tightly sealed glass jar, with 
the solids still in the bottom. It will last for many years. Left 
undisturbed, little floating white bits will form on the surface. 
Lacking these, the Lime Water is not strong enough and more lime 
must be added. Another test is to shake it up. If the solids sink to 
the bottom immediately, the water is too weak. They should float down.
