<h1>Maggi&reg; Cubes - African</h1>
<br><img src="img/sa_maggcb04g.jpg" alt="Maggi Cubes, wrapped and unrapped" class=mrg>
<p>

You will find Maggi Cubes called for in almost every West African recipe 
composed in recent times. These cubes are used incessantly in both 
restaurants and homes - except in regions too poor to afford them. They 
have almost completely replaced the traditional flavorings of Ogiri 
(fermented sesame seeds or other oil seeds) and Sumbala / Dawadawa 
(fermented locust bean seeds). While convenience is a major issue here, 
another major issue is the increasing difficulty of obtaining the locust 
bean seeds needed for Sumbala, and their ever increasing cost. 
Additionally, there is Nestl&eacute;'s ubiquitous and bright red and 
yellow advertising of the product.</p>
<p>These cubes are rather small, about 0.55 inches / 14 mm on a side. 
Ingredients: &nbsp; Iodized Salt, Sugar, Flavor Enhancers 
(Monosodium Glutamate, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate), 
Corn Starch, Vegetable fat (Palm), Hydrolysed Soya Beans, Water, 
Color (Ammonia Caramel), Onion, Ferric Pyrophosphate, Emulsifier 
(Soya Lecithin), Spice Extracts (White Pepper, Chili, Clove) 
Flavoring, Yeast Extract.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These cubes are imperfectly available in North 
America, but may be found in some African specialty stores, or can be 
ordered on-line. The photo specimens were purchased for 2018 US $8.95 for 
100 cubes (14-1/4 ounces), including shipping from England.</p>

<h3 class=lrg>Substitutes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Good Flavorful Stock</h3> is the best substitute. See our 
  page <a href="../recipes/goo_stock1.html"><b>Stock / Broth - General
  Method</b></a> for how to make it and how to have it conveniently on 
  hand.</li>
<li><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_maggiz.html"><h3>Maggi Seasoning:</h3></a> &nbsp; This 
  bottled seasoning is available worldwide, including North America. About 
  1/2 tablespoon per Maggi Cube will do. We find that bottled in China to 
  be closer in flavor and color than that bottled in Mexico (different 
  ingredients).</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/qip_sumbal1.html"><h3>Sumbala / Dawadawa:</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; This is one of the flavorings Maggi Cubes replaced. Traditionally 
  made from Locust Bean seeds, it is now often made from Soybeans, which 
  are far more available and easier to work with. This version is almost 
  identical to Burmese Shan <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sip_tuanao1.html">
  <b>Tua Nao</b></a>, for which we have an easy to make recipe.</li>
<li><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><h3>Chinese Fermented Black Beans:</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; These are also considered a good substitute, and available in 
  any Asian market in North America, as well as many regular supermarkets.
<li><h3>Ogiri:</h3> &nbsp; This is another flavoring replaced by 
  Maggi Cubes. It is traditionally Sesame Seeds boiled and fermented 
  wrapped in a banana leaf or other native leaf. Today it is often made 
  from less expensive oil seeds like Egusi or Fluted Pumpkin. We hope to 
  have a recipe and write-up soon. This product is reputed to be very 
  smelly.</li>
</ul>
