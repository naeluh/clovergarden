<p>[Jugo (Mexico), Maggi W&uuml;rze (Germany)]
</p><p>
This important seasoning was originally manufactured in Switzerland. 
It has found a worldwide market, and you will find it called for in many 
recipes, especially from Southeast Asia where it is also a table 
condiment. Its bottle and trade dress are widely imitated by Asian 
knock-offs. It is also very popular in Central Europe and Mexico. The 
brand is now owned by Nestl&eacute;, and is distributed in North 
America by Nestl&eacute; USA.</p>
<p>Maggi is similar to soy sauce, but formulated to be more of a meat 
broth analog. Maggi Seasoning is used in soups, stews and sauces, but 
also in salad dressings and vegetable dressings. In Vietnam it is an 
absolutely essential ingredient in the famous

<p>The photo specimen was "Product of China" (unleaded, I hope), purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, and is the small, 6.7 ounce 
table condiment size</p>

<p>In my opinion, The European made is best, that made in China has second 
best, and that made in Mexico is third best. In a big Asian market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel), the European sells at a much higher price than 
the Asian.
