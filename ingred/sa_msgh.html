<span class=bg>This highly controversial white crystalline powder is 
rapidly increasing in use, particularly in processed foods. The reason 
for this is simple, it enhances flavors. Processed foods are loaded with 
salt and spiked with MSG to cover their lack of natural flavor. Here we 
explore the controversy over its health impact.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Monosodium Glutamate</h3> was first identified in 1909 in seaweed 
extract, a substance long used in Japan as a flavor enhancer. It was 
immediately patented and put into production by the newly formed 
Ajinomoto company,<p></p>

<p>While MSG was, in the past, associated with Chinese restaurants, today 
per capita consumption is higher in North America than it is in Asia. It 
is applied to nearly all processed foods (including canned vegetables), 
snack foods and fast food. It is used in restaurants of all types, fast 
food, family and upscale gourmet - and they'll all deny it until forced 
to reveal the ingredient list. The only place you have a chance of 
getting a meal low in MSG is in one of the Asian restaurants advertising 
"No MSG", but there'll be some hiding there too.</p>

<p>Monosodium glutamate has two forms, <small>L</small>-glutamate and 
<small>D</small>-glutamate. Only 
<small>L</small>-glutamate has flavor enhancing properties, and the 
manufactured product is about 99.6% <small>L</small>-glutamate.

<h3>Natural Occurrence:</h3> &nbsp; Monosodium glutamate is found in 
fermented products such as soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce in about 
the same concentration as in MSG-added products, but it is only about 
95% <small>L</small>-glutamate. It also occurs in mushrooms and some 
vegetables.<p></p>

<h3>Concealment:</h3> &nbsp; Knowing that many people would like to avoid 
MSG, the food industry hides it with alternative names. Among these are 
"Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein", "Natural Flavor", "Natural Meet Tenderizer", 
"Autolyzed Yeast" and "Hydrolyzed Pea Protein" (<a href="sa_msgh.html#m09">M9</a>). 
The phrase "No Added MSG" is illegal but used because it is no longer much 
enforced. It is a sure sign that ingredients used to make the product 
included MSG.<p></p>

<h2 id="china">Chinese Restaurant Syndrome</h2>

<p>Back in 1968 it was noted that people who had just dined at a Chinese 
restaurant could show a number of symptoms. These were thought to be 
caused by Monosodium Glutamate - and at the time Chinese restaurants were 
the place one was most likely to get exposed to MSG. The symptoms were 
normally mild but could sometimes be very severe, and could be any one, 
any combination of, or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Flushing</li>
<li>Headache, including migraine</li>
<li>Numbness or burning in or around the mouth.</li>
<li>Sense of facial pressure or swelling.</li>
<li>Sweating.</li>
<li>Abnormal heart rhythm.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Swelling of lips and throat</li>
</ul>

<p>Since that time, this assignment of blame has been hotly debated. 
Studies have not provided a consistent answer, particularly since only a 
minority of people say they experience these symptoms and the symptoms 
can be very inconsistent from day to day. Nonetheless, the FDA continues 
to get many anecdotal reports of these symptoms from MSG exposure.</p>
 
<p>Contributing to the complexity and difficulty in coming up with a 
consistent answer in either direction is that MSG, very similar to 
important neurotransmitter glutamine, is one of the few substances that 
can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. What it does when it gets there 
is very hard to say. Nonetheless, most studies have yielded a negative 
outcome (<a href="sa_msgh.html#m06">M6</a>), but many people remain unconvinced.</p>

<p>MSGTruth.org suggests "American Restaurant Syndrome" because  MSG 
is now more prevalent (and less avoidable) in American restaurants than 
in Asian. They list KFC as the very worst offender, with Burger King 
trailing in second place.</p>

<h2 id="migr">MSG <small>&amp;</small> Migraine Headaches</h2>

<p>Some persons subject to migraine headaches say they are touched off by 
MSG. Once again the reports are persistent and insistent, but anecdotal. 
Studies have failed to find a consistent link, as did a recent study 
conducted at the University of Putra, Malaysia (<a href="sa_msgh.html#m08">M8</a>). 
Note, though, there's a little hedging with phrases like "in the general 
population" and "consistent evidence".</p>


<h2 id="obese">MSG <small>&amp;</small> Obesity / Type II Diabetes</h2>

<p>This one is downright scary. To study obesity and type II diabetes 
scientists need obese rats with type II diabetes. Rats are naturally 
resistant to obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>Newly born rats are injected with MSG. By 60 weeks of age they are 
diabetic. obese, partially blind from cataracts and have other serious 
health problems (<a href="sa_msgh.html#m03">M3</a>). This has been known since at 
least 1978 and it apparently carries over to humans consuming MSG, at 
least to an extent.</p>
<p>The FDA considers MSG GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) and places no 
limits on how much is in processed or prepared foods. They claim it is 
safe in any quantity.</p>
