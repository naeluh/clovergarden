<p>
Like other beans, Fava Beans can be fermented and otherwise processed 
into sauces, pastes, and potions. They are particularly favord for this 
in southern China, where they are used in place of the Soy Beans used in 
the rest of China.

<h2>Fermented Broad Bean Paste</h2>
<br><img src="img/bp_pastfb01e.jpg" alt="Fermented Fava Bean Paste" class=mrg>
<p>[Doubanjiang]</p>
<p>This is Fermented Fava Beans with no Chilis, and is what Doubanjiang 
is in southern China outside of Sichuan and Hunan. In these regions, the 
Sichuan type with chilis is called La-Doubanjiang (hot bean paste). 
Farther north, bean pastes are made with Soy Beans, rather than Fava 
Beans. The photo example is Lian How brand, made in City of Industry, 
California, and the most available fermented broad bean paste here 
in Los Angeles. Ingred: Bean, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite.

<h2>Chili Broad Bean Paste</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_chilibb11e.jpg" alt="Chili Fermented Fava Bean Paste" class=mrg>
<p>[Doubanjiang, La-Doubanjiang (outside Sichuan (hot doubanjiang))]
</p><p>
This is an essential ingredient for Sichuan cuisine, and reported to be 
used in half of all Sichuan recipes. The photo specimen is Lian How 
brand, (City of Industry, California) which is very popular here in Los 
Angeles. What chilis are used are not specified, but the Erjingtiao 
chilis favored in Sichuan are not available here, and getting pretty 
scarce in Sichuan as well. This sauce is a little hotter than the 
Traditional version (see below) but not enough to worry about. Unlike 
the traditional, it has been ground sufficiently to not need chopping 
before use, but it is still coarse, with noticeable bits of chili skins. 
This sauce has some oil in it (untoasted sesame oil), which is preferred 
by restaurants, as it gives a more intense red color than without. 
Unlike the traditionals, it lists no wheat, so is probably celiac safe,
and with sesame oil, soy safe as well. Ingred: Chili, Broad Bean, Salt, 
Vinegar, Sesame Oil.

<h2>Chili Broad Bean Paste - Traditional</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_chilibb08e.jpg" alt="Chili Fermented Fava Bean Paste, Traditional" class=mrg>
<p>[Doubanjiang, La-Doubanjiang (outside Sichuan (hot doubanjiang))]
</p><p>
This is an essential ingredient for Sichuan cuisine, and reported to be 
used in half of all Sichuan recipes. The traditional sauce is properly 
made from Erjingtiao Chilis and peeled Broad Beans, fermented in the hot 
sun for at least 6 months, including one whole summer. It may be 
fermented up to 36 months. Pixian Doubanjiang, made in the town of 
Pixian in Sichuan is a "Protected Designation".</p>
<p>One of the top Pixian brands is Juan Cheng, which makes a variety 
of products of differing age, and both traditional versions and versions 
with some soy oil included. The photo is of a premium traditional 
version. Note that it is very coarse, with lots of chili skins, and needs 
to be chopped well for use. Note that many versions, especially the 
traditional ones, are not Celiac safe, as they include some wheat flour 
to help with fermentation.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Various brands are available in Asian markets 
and on-line in North America, at widely variable pricing. Traditional 
versions are generally vacuum packed in plastic bags, while those with 
oil added (the most popular with restaurants) are generally in jars. 
The photo example was a Juan Cheng brand premium traditional Pixian 
Doubanjiang purchased through Amazon for 2020 US $14.95 for a 1 kilo 
(2.2 pound) plastic bag wrapped in traditional paper and rope tied. 
Ingred: Broad Beans, Red Chili, Wheat Flour, Salt, Potassium Sorbate.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp;  Jarred versions, including the Lian How, are 
pretty shelf stable, but the traditional versions, if not refrigerated, 
are going to continue to ferment. This is not dangerous (except for the 
possibility of a burst jar), but can be annoying.<p></p>


<h3>Cooking</h3> &nbsp; For traditional versions, the first step is to 
chop the paste to however fine is appropriate for your recipe. Some  
jarred versions are already chopped fairly fine, but some are not. The 
next step is to heat your Oil and fry the Doubanjiang until the oil is 
fragrant and well colored, then start adding other ingredients.<p></p>
