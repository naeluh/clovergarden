<p>
This salt used as a finishing salt both in North America and India, but in 
India is also important in recipes, particularly for Chaat Masala, a very 
important seasoning for street vendors. It is also included in some chutneys, 
sprinkled on fruit, and used to flavor lemonade and similar drinks. It is 
used by vegans to replace the sulfurous character of eggs.</p>

<p>Natural salts containing sulphates are mined in volcanic regions, and are 
then heated in a kiln for 24 hours, sealed in a ceramic jar with charcoal and 
possibly some other organic materials. This converts the almost colorless 
natural salts to Black Salt and develops the strong smell and taste of sulphur 
by converting the natural sulphates to sodium sulphide, iron sulphide, and 
hydrogen sulphide. Ground, Black Salt is usually a grayish pink color.</p>

<p>Today it is also manufactured from regular salt, combined with sodium 
sulfate, sodium bisulfate and ferric sulfate. This is heated in a kiln with 
charcoal the same as with the mined salts to convert those to sulfides.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This product can be found in markets serving a 
primarily Indian community, or can be purchased on-line. I suggest buying 
it in chunks, as it is rumored "alternative" methods are sometimes used 
to make powdered products.  Do not confuse this product with Hawaiian 
Black Salt or Cyprus Black Salt, those are just sea salt mixed with 
charcoal.<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Some sulphur is necessary in a 
healthy diet, as it is needed for synthesis of some proteins. Current 
evidence is that natural foods containing sulphur provide a sufficient 
amount, but some diets may be deficient. The wonderful flavor of fried 
Onions (and the tears) are largely from high sulphur content. Those 
forbidden onions by religion often fill the sulphur gap with the resin 
asafoetida, also high in sulphur.<p></p>
