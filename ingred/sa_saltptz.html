<h1>Curing Salts</h1>
<br><img src="img/sa_sea02d.jpg" alt="Sea Salt" class=mrg>
<p>
We no longer have to kill all our animals in the Autumn because we can't 
feed them through the winter. That, along with modern transport and 
refrigeration, makes the need to preserve meats for winter consumption 
much less urgent. the flavors of preserved meat products, however, are 
still found very desirable.</p>
<p>The main preservative used for meat is salt, but just salt has been 
found wanting. The resulting meat is an unattractive gray-brown color, 
and salt alone is insufficient to prevent infection by some dangerous 
micro-organisms. It was found, however, that a little potassium nitrate 
mixed with the salt resulted in an attractive pink color, helped prevent 
bacterial contamination, particularly by botulism, improved flavor and 
texture, and prevented rancidity.</p>
<p>Today a number of mixes of salt and potassium or sodium nitrate and/or 
nitrite are used by both home preservers and the food industry.  Some 
health advocates hold that these should not be used, but actual risk 
analysis has concluded that the risk from these compounds being in the 
meat is much smaller than the risk from them not being there.

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>

<p>The most obvious result of nitrate / nitrite cures is in meat color. 
Nitrates have no direct effect on color, but bacteria convert nitrate 
to nitrite which does. This is why nitrite is faster acting. There is a 
further bacterial action that converts nitrite to nitric oxide, which, 
combining with myoglobin in the meat, is responsible for the attractive 
pink color.</p>

<h2>Salt:</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_sea02k.jpg" alt="Sea Salt" class=mrg>
Unlike a natural salt pickle of vegetables, 
sea salt is not essential for curing meat. You may use it, regular table 
salt or non-iodized table salt as you please. Kosher salt can be used with 
the appropriate adjustment of volume, depending on brand.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Saltpeter:</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sa_potnitr02k.jpg" alt="Potassium Nitrate" class=mrg>
This may be Potassium Nitrate or Sodium Nitrate. In the food industry 
these have been largely replaced by Sodium and Potassium nitrite or a 
mix of nitrite and nitrate (see Prague Powders, below). Nitrite is faster 
acting than nitrate and less is required. Actually, Nitrate breaks down 
into Nitrite during the curing process.
<p>I use Potassium Nitrate in wet pickling meats, such as pig feet, where 
quantities are easily controlled. 0.16 to 0.20 teaspoon (less than 1/4 
teaspoon) of nitrate to a quart of water, along with 2 Tablespoons of 
regular salt is a fairly normal brine concentration.</p>

<p>USDA regulations allow up to 2.75 ounces of sodium or potassium 
nitrate per 100 pounds of chopped meat, or 0.25 ounces of sodium or 
potassium nitrite.

<h2>Prague Powder #1:</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_prag101k.jpg" alt="Pink Salt" class=mrg>
Also known as Instacure #1, this is a mix of 6.25% Sodium Nitrite and 
93.75% Salt. Some color, usually red dye #3, is added to give it a 
tint (intensity varies with manufacturer). The purpose here is safety - 
the nitrite is very dilute and easy to measure accurately, and it's 
recognizable by color. The "Insta cure" name refers to the faster 
action of nitrite over nitrate.

<p>Prague Powder #1 is used for curing meats that remain fairly wet and 
are cooked before serving. Bacon and sausages are examples.  About 2 
teaspoons is sufficient to cure 10 pounds of chopped meat and is mixed 
directly into the meat.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Prague Powder #2:</h2>
<p><img src="img/sa_prag202k.jpg" alt="Pink Salt" class=mrg>
Also known as Instacure #2, this is a mix of 6.25% Sodium Nitrite, 
1% Sodium Nitrate and 92.75% Salt. Some color, usually red dye #3, is 
added to give it a tint (intensity varies with manufacturer). The 
purpose here is safety - the nitrite is very dilute and easy to measure 
accurately, and it's recognizable by color. The "Insta cure" name refers 
to the faster action of nitrite over nitrate.

<p>Prague Powder #2 is used for curing meats that are air dried for a long 
time. The Nitrite is fast acting and the Nitrate is like a time release 
medication, acting over an extended period.  About 2 teaspoons is 
sufficient to cure 10 pounds of chopped meat and is mixed directly into 
the meat.

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Safety:</h2>
<br><img src="img/skull01m.jpg" alt="Skull" class=mrg>
Sodium and Potassium nitrates are dangerous chemicals, powerful oxidizers 
used in gunpowder and rocket fuel, but their main risk in the kitchen is 
being mistaken for regular salt. In the quantities regular salt is used, 
both nitrates and nitrites can kill. You <b>must</b> see that they are 
properly contained, labeled and will not fall into unauthorized hands.
<p></p>

<p>Nitrates are naturally found in many vegetables at much higher 
concentrations than in cured meats, particularly in spinach, beets, 
radishes, celery, and cabbages. Most reports of nitrate poisoning are 
from vegetables, not cured meat. Nitrate is converted to nitrite in 
the stomach.</p>

<p>No, Saltepeter will not make your pecker go flat - that's just a 
boarding school myth - but English gin works for that. Adding nitrate 
directly to food would be dangerous in any case. The trick of avoiding 
any cafeteria food that's white wouldn't work anyway - saltpeter would 
be dissolved, clear and invisible regardless of color.</p>

<p>There have been concerns about nitrosamines, formed from nitrites 
during cooking or in the stomach. Nitrosamines are known to be 
carcenogenic, but no actual evidence of risks to humans has been found. 
Nitrosamines will form in bacon at temperatures of 350&deg;F/157&deg;C 
and above. The FDA requires addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or 
sodium erythorbate to products likely to be cooked at high temperatures 
which greatly reduces formation of nitrosamines. There is no reliable 
information about formation of nitrosamines in the stomach.</p>

<p>No carcinogenic effect resulting directly from nitrate or nitrite has 
been found. To achieve a fatal level of nitrites you'd theoretically have 
to eat, at a minimum, 18 pounds of cured meat at a single sitting, but in 
practice, due to digestive activity, it would likely take more than 50 
pounds - meanwhile, you would either explode or the salt would kill you.
