[Vegetable broth seasoning powder]
<p>
Vegeta is the most well known and widely distributed vegetable seasoning 
powder. It is marketed as an "All Purpose Seasoning", useful as a rub for 
all meats, poultry and fish, but also for soups, stews, stir fries, 
casseroles and vegetable dishes. It is particularly useful to 
non-vegetarians when they have to produce a vegetarian soup or stew, 
don't have vegetable stock on hand, and are pressed for time.</p>

<p>The photo sample was imported from Croatia. Ingerd: Salt, dehydrated 
vegetables (carrot, parsnip, onion, potato, celery, parsley leaves), 
monosodium glutamate, sugar, cornstarch, black pepper, nutmeg, disodium 
inosinate, riboflavin (color).</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles, but it is widely distributed and 
probably available even in some supermarkets..<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; With the can tightly closed with its lid, and 
placed away from heat, it will last more than a year.<p></p>

<h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; 3/4 to 1 teaspoon per cup of boiling water. Adjust 
to taste. For soups and stews, add it with 5 minutes to go in the 
cooking time.<p></p>

<h3>Seasoning Meats:</h3> Sprinkle on and massage in before cooking or 
grilling.<p></p>
