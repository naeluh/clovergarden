<h1>Salts, Additives <small>&amp;</small> Seasoning Mixes</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Many of our most important foods are a little bland and 
can become monotonous when often repeated. This has resulted in an 
endless search for new seasonings to break the monotony and add interest. 
Seasonings provide the cook with a palate of tastes s/he may exploit, 
either to fame or disgrace.</span>

<h2 id="sc"><u>Sodium Chloride Salts</u></h2>
<p></p>
<a href="salt.html">
<img src="img/sa_saltpans01c.jpg" alt="Andes Salt Pans" class=mrg></a>
<b>Sodium Chloride Salt</b> is the most important of all seasonings. It is 
essential to flavor and essential to life itself. It can also be 
dangerous. Just how dangerous and how much of it is dangerous is very 
much a matter of controversy today. For its importance as a seasoning 
and for its effects on health we have given salt two pages of its own.

<h2 id=ss><u>Other Simple Salts</u></h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Baking Soda</h3>
<br><img src="img/sa_baksod01c.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda" class=mrg>
[Nahcolite (mineral form); Sodium bicarbonate, Bicarbonate of Soda, 
  Saleratus (19th Century)]
<p>
The main use of Baking Soda is as a leavening agent in quick breads and 
the like. It reacts with acids in the dough, producing bubbles of 
Carbon Dioxide. The acid may be provided by lemon juice, yogurt, 
buttermilk, cocoa, vinegar, cream of tartar or phosphates. Without 
acid, some Carbon Dioxide will be released by thermal decomposition at 
temperatures above 180&deg;F/80&deg;C.</p>
<p>Baking soda was formerly used to make green vegetables greener, but 
this is little done today as the color looks artificial and it damages 
nutrition and flavor. Today, color is preserved by not overcooking. 
Baking soda is often used to speed cooking of beans and in the traditional 
British dish Mushy Peas. In some regions it is used to tenderize meat, 
but all these cooking uses degrade nutrition. More usefully, it is used 
in breading of fried foods to make the breading more porous so it is 
not steamed off the food. Baking Soda has been tested in place of 
Edible Potash in various Nigerian recipes and found to work just fine.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Baking Powder</h3>
<br><img src="img/sa_bakpwd01c.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Baking Powder" class=mrg>
<p>
This mixture is used as a leavening agent for quick breads and baked 
goods without enough gluten to hold bubbles long or where a fermented 
taste is undesirable. It includes Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) and 
an acid powder. Today most available is "Double Acting" with one acid 
releasing at room temperature with moisture, the other releasing acid 
with heat. The photo sample is made from Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate 
(high temperature acid) Sodium Bicarbonate, Corn Starch (flow agent), 
and Monocalcium Phosphate (low temperature acid). Baking Powders with 
Sodium Aluminum Sulphate or Phosphate instead of Sodium Acid 
Pyrophosphate are going out of style due to suspicion of Aluminum as 
a neurotoxin and claims that some people can detect a metallic taste 
in baked goods made with it.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cream of Tartar</h3> 
<br><img src="img/sa_crmtart01c.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Cream of Tartar" class=mrg>
[Potassium bitartrate, potassium hydrogen tartrate]
<p>
This substance is a byproduct of wine making.It is used to stabilize 
beaten egg whites and whipped cream, and to reduce discoloration in 
boiled vegetables. It is also used to prevent crystallization of sugar 
syrups and sometimes as an acid ingredient in Baking Powders.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Lime</h3>
<br><a href="sa_limez.html">
<img src="img/sa_lime03e.jpg" alt="Tubs of Lime Paste" class=mrg></a>
[Calcium Hydroxide, (Ca(OH)2)]
<p>
Lime is used in Thailand to produce crisper, longer lasting batters on 
fruits and other deep fried items. It is also used in pickling, and has 
long been so used in the West, but is no longer recommended.

<h3>Banga Soup Seasoning</h3>
<br><a href="../recipes/qys_banga1.html">
<img src="../recipes/img/sa_banga01c.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Banga Soup Seasoning" class=mrg></a>
<p>
While this seasoning is necessary to make a traditional version of the 
famous Banga Soup (Palm Fruit Soup) of the Nigerian Delta region, it is 
all but impossible to make authentically in North America, so 
commercially available mixes may have to be resorted to.

<h3>Beef Bouillon Powder</h3>
<br><a href="sa_cowpowd.html">
<img src="img/sa_cowpowd2s.jpg" alt="Jar of Beef Bouillon Powder" class=mrg></a>
<p>
[Beef flavored broth mix]
</p><p>
This is the same as Bouillon Cubes, so you could use the same amount 
of crushed cubes. Bouillon mixes of this sort are much used in regions of the world that 
have inadequate refrigeration to hold stocks beyond the day made. A home 
made beef stock is always the best substitute.
&nbsp; <a href="sa_cowpowd.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Chicken Bouillon Powder</h3>
<br><a href="sa_chkpowd.html">
<img src="img/sa_chkpowd02s.jpg" alt="Can of Chicken Bouillon Powder" class=mrg></a>
<p>
[Chicken flavored broth mix]
</p><p>
This is the same as Bouillon Cubes, so you could use the same amount 
of crushed cubes. East and Southeast Asian recipes depend a lot of 
chicken stock being continuously available, but that isn't always 
practical in this day when servants and stay at home cooks are 
increasingly scarce. This is particularly so for Southeast Asians now 
living in North America. This has made Chicken Powder an essential 
ingredient for cobbling up small amounts of stock quickly. Due to it's 
common availability it has also found use as a general seasoning.</p>
<p>Some of the Asian brands are entirely artificial, completely 
unrelated to actual chickens, so might be of more interest to 
vegetarians. It is a good idea to read the ingredients list before 
purchasing.

<h3>Vegeta</h3>
<br><a href="sa_vegeta.html">
<img src="img/sa_vegeta01s.jpg" alt="Can of Vegeta Seasoning" class=mrg></a>

[Vegetable flavored broth mix]
<p>
This is the best known and most widely distributed Vegetable Seasoning, 
It is marketed as an "All Purpose Seasoning", useful as a rub for all 
meats, fish, and poultry, but also for soups, stews, stir fries, 
casseroles and vegetable dishes. It is particularly useful to 
non-vegetarians when they have to produce a vegetarian soup or stew, 
don't have vegetable stock on hand and are pressed for time.
&nbsp; <a href="sa_vegeta.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Curry Powders</h3>
<br><img src="img/qys_currywa1c.jpg" alt="West African Curry Powder" class=mrg>
These are an Anglo-Indian invention. The British adopted Curry Powder 
in order to have something similar to the flavors of India conveniently 
at hand. In India, separate spices would be added differently to each 
dish rather than a standard mix. The Anglo-Indian "Madras Curry Powder" 
has been introduced to North America and the former British colonies in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. Sun Brand and Ship Brand are well known and of good 
quality.
<p>There is no official recipe, so different brands vary tremendously 
in taste and quality. Different regions have come up with their own 
formulas. Here we have recipes of examples typical to several 
regions:
<br><a href="../recipes/iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>
<br><a href="../recipes/rys_cpjamai1.html"><b>Jamaican Curry Powder</b></a>
<br><a href="../recipes/qys_currywa1.html"><b>West African Curry Powder</b></a>
<br><a href="../recipes/sys_curryp1.html"><b>Singapore Curry Powder</b></a>
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Garam Masala</h3>
<br><img src="img/iys_gmbong1c.jpg" alt="Bengali Garam Masala" class=mrg>
Here we have a spice mix that actually is ground and mixed ahead in 
India, but it's not commercial - every household has its own formula. 
Unlike curry spices, Garam Masala is not a base flavoring, but more of 
an aromatic finishing seasoning applied in the last stages of cooking.  
It varies considerably from on region of India to another. Here we have 
recipes 
of examples typical to several regions:
<br><a href="../recipes/iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala #1</b></a> 
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; Northwest India
<br><a href="../recipes/iys_masalgmk1.html"><b>Kashmir Garam Masala</b></a>

<h3>Maggi&reg; Seasoning</h3>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_maggiz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sa_maggi02m.jpg" alt="Small Bottle of Magi Seasoning" class=mrg></a>
 [Jugo (Mexico), Maggi W&uuml;rze (Germany)]
<p>
This important seasoning was originally manufactured in Switzerland. 
It has found a worldwide market. and you will find it called for in many 
recipes, especially from Southeast Asia, where it is also a table 
condiment. Its bottle and trade dress are widely imitated by Asian 
knock-offs. It is also very popular in Central Europe and Mexico.</p>
<p>Maggi is similar to soy sauce, but formulated to be more of a meat 
broth analog. It is used in soups, stews and sauces, but also in salad 
dressings and vegetable dressings. The brand is now owned by Nestl&eacute;, 
and is distributed in North America by Nestl&eacute; USA.

<h3>Maggi&reg; Cubes - African</h3>
<br><a href="sa_maggcbz.html">
<img src="img/sa_maggcb04h.jpg" alt="Maggi Cubes, wrapped and unwrapped" class=mrg></a>
<p>
You will find Maggi Cubes called for in almost every West African recipe 
composed in recent times. These cubes are used incessantly in both 
restaurants and homes - except in regions too poor to afford them. They 
have almost completely replaced the traditional flavorings of Ogeri 
(fermented sesame seeds) and Sumbala / Dawadawa (fermented locust bean 
seeds). While convenience is a major issue here, another major issue 
is the increasing difficulty of obtaining the locust bean seeds needed 
for Sumbala, and their ever increasing cost.	Additionally, there is 
Nestl&eacute;'s ubiquitous and brightly colored advertising of the 
product.

<h3>MSG</h3>
<br><a href="sa_msgh.html">
<img src="img/sa_msg01k.gif" alt="Chemical Formula" class=mrg></a>
[Monosodium Glutamate, Sodium Glutamate, Additive E621, Ajinomoto, 
Vetsin, Accent]
<p>
This highly controversial white crystalline powder is rapidly increasing 
in use, particularly in processed foods. The reason for this is simple, it 
enhances flavors. Processed foods are loaded with salt and spiked with 
MSG to cover their lack of natural flavor.</p>
<p>First identified in seaweed, glutamate exists in many natural foods, 
including mushrooms and some vegetables. 
Formerly made from wheat, it is now industrially produced by bacterial 
fermentation of carbohydrates, and is celiac safe. It's safety in other 
respects has been strongly attacked and just as strongly defended. See 
our page <a href="sa_msgh.html"><b>MSG &amp; Health</b></a>. &nbsp;

<h3>Potash, Edible</h3>
<br><img src="img/sa_potashe01h.jpg" alt="1/4 teaspoon Edible Potash" class=mrg>
[Natron; Akanwu, Akaun (Igbo); Kanwa (Hausa); Hydrated Sodium Carbonate 
(with other salts)]
<p>
This substance is mineral salts gathered from dry salt beds in arid 
regions. Color will vary by region. It is used in cooking, particularly 
in Africa, to shorten the cooking time of beans, to emulsify Red Palm 
Oil with water, to make recipes with Okra more slimy (yes, they want 
that in Africa), and to make green vegetables more green.</p> 
<p>Potash has been shown to reduce the amount of protein in foods it is 
cooked with. Some of the other substances found in natural Potash may 
be toxic, but used occasionally in recipe quantities it is considered 
safe. It should not be consumed by pregnant women as it has been shown 
to cause early stage abortions.
<br><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; Baking Soda (not baking powder) has been tested 
in various Nigerian recipes and found to work just fine.
