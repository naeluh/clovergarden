<h1>Salt - Sodium Chloride</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>From ancient times to the Renaissance, salt was scarce and very 
costly in much of the world. Regions fortunate enough to have salt 
deposits or geography suitable for salt evaporation pans were prosperous, 
as were the merchants who transported salt to regions of scarcity.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>
<p></p>

<p>8000 years ago in Rumania, large scale salt production was already 
under way. Brine from a salt spring was concentrated into crystal salt 
by boiling it dry in clay pots. The pots were broken and the salt 
packaged for a very profitable trade with peoples in regions without 
a good supply. In China, salt harvesting from a salt lake began around 
the same time.</p>

<p>A major use of salt from those times was to preserve meat, fish, and 
later vegetables. While this is no longer necessary in developed regions 
of the world, the unique flavors produced by salt preservation have kept 
salted fish, meat and vegetables in high demand.</p>

<p>While the often repeated story that Roman legions were paid in salt 
is not actually true, it was still a very expensive commodity. Celts in 
Austria made a good living selling salted meat to Greece and Rome up to 
the beginning of the Common Era. By the Renaissance transportation and 
production had improved to the point salt was well on it's way to being 
the low cost commodity it is today.</p>

<p>Today food grade salt is a rather small market, accounting for less than 
5% of production in Europe and North America. The rest goes to Industrial 
applications. World production is over 240 million tons per year.</p>


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties of Salt</h2>
<p></p>

<p>There are two basic varieties of food grade salt: <b>Refined Table Salt</b> 
and <b>Natural Salt</b>, which may be evaporated from seawater or mined from 
deposits left by vanished lakes, seas and salt flats.</p>

<h2>Table Salt</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_table01h.jpg" alt="Table Salt crystals" class=mrg>
Any convenient salt feed can be used for this process. Sodium Chloride, 
about 99% pure, is extracted by various processes and all other salts are 
eliminated. This makes a dry product which works fairly well in salt shakers. 

<p>To make it shake even better small amounts of anti-caking substances are 
added. A number of these are in use: tricalcium phosphate, calcium or 
magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, 
silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate, calcium 
aluminosilicate and Sodium ferrocyanide (yellow prussiate of soda).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Iodized Salt:</h2> &nbsp; This is usually Table Salt, but 
Sea Salt and Mineral Salt are also often iodized by addition of small 
amounts of Iodine compounds. Dietary iodine is insufficient for health in 
many inland and mountainous regions, causing swollen thyroid (goiter), 
stunted growth and severe mental retardation (cretinism). Iodized salt has 
largely eliminated these problems in North America, but the program is now 
loosing effectiveness due to various influences (see 
<a href="salth.html">Salt and Health</a>). Iodized salt also generally 
contains a very small (0.04%), nutritionally insignificant amount of the 
sugar dextrose, which stabilizes the potassium iodide to prevent free iodine 
in the salt.
<p>Cook's Illustrated ran comparative tests in their test kitchen using 
salted popcorn. A few people said they could detect a faint chemical 
aftertaste from the iodized salt but most said they could detect no 
difference between iodized and non-iodized.</p>

<h2>Sea Salt</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_seakorea04h.jpg" alt="Sea Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
Natural Sea Salt is simply what's left when seawater evaporates. It is 
usually sold as rather large, fluffy looking and somewhat moist crystals. 
The reason they are moist is that some of the salts other than sodium 
chloride absorb water from the air. For this reason, natural sea salt is 
not used in salt shakers at the table, but rather in salt grinders and 
mills. These are famous for clogging and breaking under the stress of 
dealing with this stuff. Better to smash it in a mortar and serve it 
in a salt cellar with a little spoon.

<p>But you have sea salt without these problems? Ha! You've been 
deceived. Major salt processors refine sea salt to the point it isn't 
much different from their regular table salt, but since it came from 
seawater they call it "sea salt" and charge a higher price for it.
Real sea salt is slightly bitter and would cake badly if ground fine 
due to moisture content. It's about 86% Sodium Chloride and the rest is 
moisture and other mineral salts (analysis in 
<a href="salth.html">Salt &amp; Health</a>). Some purveyors of sea 
salt say it is "lower sodium" than regular salt, but you may have to 
use more for the same saltiness.</p>

<p id="gris"><b>Celtic Sea Salt&reg;</b> is a brand name 
(established 1976) for very strongly marketed natural sea salts in the 
style of Brittany, France, but sourced from various regions. &nbsp; 
<b>French Grey Sea Salt</b> (Sel Gris) from Brittany is light grey in 
color from the clay salt pans it is harvested from. These are the same 
salt pans <a href="salt.html#fleur"><b>Sel de Fleur</b></a> is harvested from.</p>
<p> An economical place to get natural sea salt is from a Korean market, 
because natural sea salt is important to making salt fermented kimchi, 
and without kimchi there is no Korean cuisine. The photo specimen is 
Korean. Here in Los Angeles it sells for around 2015 US $1.50/pound in 
2 pound bags, less in larger bags.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Mined Salt</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_mined02e.jpg" alt="Mined Salt crystals" class=mrg>
This salt is obtained from ancient salt flats, salt lakes and inland seas 
that have dried up and been buried by normal geologic processes. Straight 
from the mines it's a natural product, but it's also used as feedstock 
for salt refining.
<p>Natural mined salt is generally slightly gray in color, though it can 
be other colors depending on what geological processes it's gone through 
and what minerals were carried through it by groundwater. The photo 
specimens are from Russia (left) and Armenia (right). They are ground 
coarser than table salt and are slightly gray with a few darker speck 
in them. They can be used in salt shakers if the shaker is sturdy enough 
to be whacked firmly to break up the clumps every time you use it.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Kosher Salt</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_kosher01h.jpg" alt="Kosher Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
There is nothing magic about Kosher salt - it is <u>identical</u> to 
un-iodized <u>table salt</u> except for crystal size and shape. The 
crystals are optimized for "koshering" meat - drawing out the blood. It 
is not itself any more nor any less "kosher" than table salt. Like 
regular table salt it may contain anti-caking agents such as Sodium 
ferrocyanide (yellow prussiate of soda).
<p>Celebrity chefs and writers of gourmet recipes now automatically call 
for kosher salt - its the "in" thing. They imagine the iodine in the salt 
will ruin the taste of their recipe, though it is highly unlikely to be 
at all detectable. This is worrisome to health officials, but celebrity 
chefs aren't concerned about your health, they are concerned about your 
wallet. If avoiding iodine is the point, non-iodized table salt is just 
as easily available today.</p>
<p>The one place where kosher salt has a definite advantage is in rubs 
and the like, where you don't want the crystals to dissolve quickly - 
and there the low density Diamond Crystal salt has a wide advantage 
over others. Twice the volume for the same saltiness makes for a more 
even coating.</p> 
<p>It pisses me off that chefs and food writers automatically call for 
"kosher salt" without specifying which brand they use. Different volume for 
the same saltiness makes it necessary to adjust recipes.  Multiply by the 
adjustments below when converting table salt to kosher - divide by the 
adjustment when converting kosher to table salt. Recipes on Clovegarden are 
invariably for regular table salt unless <u>specifically</u> stated 
otherwise.

<h2>Ice Cream Salt</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_icecrm01h.jpg" alt="Ice Cream Salt crystals" class=mrg>
This is table salt in very large crystals, to nearly 1/2 inch long. 
The object is to dissolve slowly, mixed with ice in an ice cream maker. 
Since salt water freezes at a much lower temperature than fresh water 
the saltiness forces the ice to absorb more heat from its surroundings 
than it normally would, thus making them colder than plain ice would. 
Yes, it doesn't seem to make sense, but it works. Morton says their 
ice cream salt is not intended for consumption - it's probably about 
the same as road salt.

<h2 id="pink">Himalayan Pink Salt</h2>
<br><a href="sa_sapnkz.html">
<img src="img/sa_mineindia02e.jpg" alt="Himalayan Pink Salt crystals" class=mrg></a>
This salt is from a huge salt mine in Pakistan, in the Salt Range, about 
190 miles from the Himalayas. It is called "Himalayan" for marketing purposes. 
Numerous health claims are made for this salt, but none are scientifically 
supported. Basically, it's Precambrian sea salt (somewhat different 
composition from current sea salt) contaminated by ground water with minerals,  
mostly iron and sulphur. It tastes pretty much like salt.<p></p>
<p>This salt is widely available in North America, from ethnic and upscale 
markets, health food stores, and on-line sources. It is sold in many forms, 
from large chunks to fine powder. If you buy it ground, you can't tell what 
it might be, and it is often faked up in India.

<h2 id="blk">Indian Black Salt</h2>
<br><a href="sa_sablkz.html">
<img src="img/sa_black03e.jpg" alt="Indian Black Salt Crystals" class=mrg></a>
[Kala Namak, Bire noon, Pada loon, Bit lobon, Sanchal (India)]
<p>Mined in volcanic regions, salt with high sulfate content is mixed with 
charcoal and processed in kilns to reduce the sulphates into sulfites. 
Black Salt has a strong smell and taste of sulphur, coming from sodium 
sulfide, iron sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide. It can also be made from 
regular salt by adding sulphates and heating in kilns with charcoal the 
same as with the mined salt.</p>

<p>This salt is used as a finishing salt in both North America and India, 
but has many other culinary uses, particularly as an ingredient in 
Chaat Masala, a seasoning very important to street vendors all through 
India, and also in some chutneys
&nbsp; <a href="sa_sablkz.html"><b>Details &amp; Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="fin" class=lrg>Finishing Salts</h2>

<p>Finishing Salts are salts that are sprinkled on food at the time of 
serving, though they may also be included in rubs and the like. They 
generally have an unusual texture, unusual color, or both, and may have 
slight differences in taste. You would not use them for cooking, because 
the texture, color and taste you are paying for would be totally lost. 
Various health claims are made, including that they have less sodium 
than regular table salt, but this is true of any natural sea salt. 
Few have a flavor much different from that of natural sea salt.</p>

   <h2 id="fleur">Fleur de Sel</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sa_fleur01h.jpg" alt="Fluer de Sel Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
   [Fleur de Sel (French); Flor de Sal (Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan)]
   <p>
   When salt starts to precipitate in salt pans, nearly all sinks to the 
   bottom, but some floats as a delicate crust on the surface. When the 
   weather is just right, it is delicately scraped off and dried in a 
   way to preserve its fluffy texture. It has the same composition as 
   natural sea salt, but has more moisture than table or kosher salt, 
   so it sticks to food better and doesn't draw out so much moisture. 
   The largest traditional suppliers are France, Portugal, Spain and 
   Mexico. In France, the salt pans from which Fleur de Sel is 
   harvested are the same ones that provide the coarser (and less expensive) 
   <a href="salt.html#gris"><b>Sel Gris</b></a>.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Maldon Salt</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sa_maldon01h.jpg" alt="Maldon Salt Crystals"  class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is a very flaky natural sea salt, and is often called for in 
   English recipes. It is made in Essex in southeastern England where 
   salt pans have been in operation for around 2000 years. It is 
   evaporated over heat, rather than by natural solar evaporation. The 
   unique texture results from a very precise "drawing" technique, 
   removal of the salt crystals from the water and final drying.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Cyprus Black Salt</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sa_cyprusb02h.jpg" alt="Cyprus Black Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is Mediterranean sea salt harvested in Cyprus and coated with 
   activated charcoal made from various natural Mediterranean woods. It is 
   noted for large, pyramid shaped crystal flakes, but is usually sold in 
   medium size flakes as in the photo, which is about 1/2 teaspoon of flakes.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Hawaiian Black Salt</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sa_hawaiib01h.jpg" alt="Hawaiian Black Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
   [Hiwa Kai, Hawaiian Black Volcano Salt, Hawaiian Black Lava Salt]
   <p>
   Despite it's sometimes being called "Black Volcano Salt" and looking 
   like black volcanic beach sand, this salt has nothing to do with 
   volcanos. The best grades are made from regular Hawaiian white sea 
   salt colored with activated charcoal made from coconut shells. Most 
   is made from partially refined California sea salt colored with 
   activated charcoal from any source.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Hawaiian Red Alaea Salt</h2> 
   <br><img src="img/sa_hawaiir01h.jpg" alt="Hawaiian Red Alaea Salt Crystals" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Ancient Hawaiians cut their salt pans into natural red volcanic clay, 
   and it picked up impurities from that clay. Today the coloring is 
   done deliberately. For the best grades, Hawaiian white sea salt is 
   mixed with red clay, and the color comes from iron oxide (rust). 
   It is a finishing salt that is also much used in rubs for meat. 
   The photo specimen label states "Hawaiian Style" and lists 
   ingredients "Sea salt &amp; purified Hawaiian alaea clay", so the 
   salt may not be of Hawaiian origin. Lower grades are made of 
   partially refined sea salt combined with a similar, but cheaper, 
   red clay imported from China.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Others</h2>
   <a href="salt.html#blk"><b>Indian Black Salt</b></a> and small crystals of 
   <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/pink"><b>Himalayan Pink Salt</b></a> are also used as finishing 
   salts.
