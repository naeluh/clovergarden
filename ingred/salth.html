<span class=bg><b>Salt</b> is totally necessary to life as we know it. 
We are creatures of the sea, and though we now live on land, we carry the 
sea within us and maintain a precarious balance between too much salt and 
too little. Lately salt has been vilified by "Modern Medical Science" 
(the quackery of tomorrow), and much of what we are told seems based on 
science just as incomplete and misinterpreted as that which told us to 
avoid the natural fats we evolved with in favor of industrially 
manufactured trans fats.</span>

<h2 id="soda">Sodium &amp; Salt</h2>

<p>A teaspoon of regular table salt weighs roughly 6 grams (6,000 mg) which 
is about 40% sodium by weight, or 2,400 mg sodium. The average American 
consumes between 3,600 and 4,800 mg of sodium per day, or 1.5 to 2 
teaspoons (American Heart Association numbers). The current U.S. 
government Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended range is between 
1,500 and 2,300 mg. The American Heart Association says 1,500 mg or less. 
Anything much below 500 mg is considered immediately dangerous, but 
maximums are highly variable, with some people reported able to handle 
30,000 mg.</p>



<h2 id="card">Salt &amp; Cardiac Health</h2>

<p>Listening to public policy proclamations, the media and do-gooders 
(one of the most dangerous elements in our society) you could easily 
conclude that the evidence is in and uncontroversial - salt consumption 
is very bad and will cause heart attacks and stroke. Salt consumption 
should be reduced by government mandate.</p>

<p>That conclusion would be quite premature. Most of the policy outcry is 
based on a single study that was <u>seriously defective in design</u>. 
Many more recent scientific and demographic studies do not support the 
conclusions of that study and some researchers now believe it was the 
accompanying radical reduction in sugar, not salt, that improved heart 
health.</p>

<p>A recent study involving over 275,000 people was published in the 
American Journal of Hypertension, published in March or April 2014, 
confirming and refining the results of previous studies. It found that 
that sodium consumption either above <u>or below</u> the "normal" range 
of 2,645 to 4,945 mg increased risk of both ACM (All-Causes Mortality) 
and CVD (Cardiovascular Mortality). It appears the AHA is, once again, 
providing recommendations detrimental to your health. Well, at least 
they are consistent.</p>

<p>Note that the AHA reports the average American currently consumes 
between 3,600 and 4,800 mg of sodium per day, which is entirely within 
the lowest mortality range. Most people in the entire world, regardless 
of diet or ethnicity, have been found to stay within the 2,645 to 4,945 
mg per day range.</p>

<p><b>The Sodium Hypothesis:</b> &nbsp; Let us start with the foundation 
of this charade, the "Sodium Hypothesis". This basis for much public policy 
and concerned outcry is simple: high blood pressure is <i>associated</i> 
with heart attacks and stroke. Salt is <i>associated</i> with high blood 
pressure. Therefore the general population should greatly reduce its salt 
consumption.</p>

<p>Note in particular the words "associated with". That is <u>not</u> the 
same as "causes". That high blood pressure causes heat attacks is not at 
all proven. It could be just another symptom of what causes them. If so, 
then reducing blood pressure will have little effect on the incidence of 
heart attacks and stroke.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many studies have simply concentrated on that one thing, 
whether limiting salt intake significantly reduces blood pressure, and not 
on the actual health outcome - does reducing salt cut the risk of heart 
attacks and/or overall mortality?</p>

<p>To date, some significant studies that did aim to determine outcome 
have shown that low salt diets <u>increase</u> the incidence of heart 
attack and stroke (<a href="salth.html#s01">S1</a>, <a href="salth.html#s02">S2</a>, 
<a href="salth.html#s03">S3</a>, <a href="salth.html#s04">S4</a>, <a href="salth.html#s07">S7</a>). 
A side result of one of the "low salt is detrimental" studies is that 
increased potassium intake reduced stroke.</p>

<p>Ignoring all of that, does reducing salt actually reduce blood 
pressure? Just as controversial - some evidence appears to show that it 
does so in only a small minority of people, not in the general population. 
Some researchers say most people have a very effective salt management 
system and would probably not show a significant blood pressure drop 
until their salt intake was very dangerously low.</p>

<p>Some promoters of lowering salt show a huge reduction in coronary 
problems from even a small decrease in salt consumption in the general 
population (<a href="salth.html#s05">S5</a>). A lot of these numbers are derived 
from "complex computer models". That is absolutely laughable. Having many 
years intensive experience with computers, I firmly believe we should be 
highly suspicious of any such numbers. Billions spent on "complex 
computer models" run on advanced supercomputers and fed by thousands of 
ground stations and satellites cannot reliably predict if it's going to 
rain tomorrow. The human body is much more complex, variable and 
difficult to model than weather patterns. Our understanding of it is 
woefully inadequate to generate a reliable computer model, but experts 
can easily create a model that provides the answer they want to see.</p>

<p>Further, According to the <b>U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</b> 
"There is insufficient evidence that, for the general population, reducing 
dietary sodium intake or increasing dietary intake of iron, beta-carotene, 
or other antioxidants results in improved health outcomes." Canadian 
institutions have come to similar conclusions.</p>

<p>Gary Taubes prize winning article in the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science's magazine <i>Science</i> concludes, "After 
interviews with some 80 researchers, clinicians, and administrators around 
the world, it is safe to say that if ever there were a controversy over 
the interpretation of scientific data, this is it. After decades of 
intensive research, the apparent benefits of avoiding salt have only 
diminished. This suggests either that the true benefit has now been 
revealed and is indeed small or that it is non-existent and researchers 
believing they have detected such benefits have been deluded by the 
confounding of other variables."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once the do-gooders have latched onto a defective 
theory, it takes on a life of its own and is almost impossible to correct. 
Careers now depend on it and businesses are now making money exploiting 
it. Unfortunately our formers of public policy pay a lot more attention 
to the shrieking do-gooders than they do to legitimate scientists. Most 
of them are politicians living by slogans and sound-bites and have little 
or no understanding of actual science, and care less.</p>

<p>But does public policy even matter? A 2009 study of 19,151 people in 
33 countries shows salt consumption is remarkably uniform over cultures 
and diets - at between 2,700 and 4,900 mg per day (<a href="salth.html#s02">S2</a>), 
pretty solidly within the "safe zone" from the new study referenced above 
(<a href="salth.html#s07">S7</a>). Other studies tend to support this data. It seems 
the body's natural salt regulating system will effectively over-ride 
public policy.</p>

<h2 id="stom">Salt &amp; Stomach Cancer</h2>

<p>A correlation has been found between high salt consumption and rates of 
stomach cancer. Studies have produced highly inconsistent results, but the 
results have been more consistent in China and Japan where large amounts 
of salt cured vegetables and seafood are consumed (<a href="salth.html#s06">S6</a>), 
but even there inconsistency is the rule.
</p>


<h2 id="iodine">Iodized Salt</h2>

<p>Dietary iodine available in many inland and mountainous regions is 
insufficient for health. Low iodine results in swollen thyroid gland 
(goiter), stunted growth and severe mental retardation (cretinism) as 
well as less obvious problems. Government mandates to add small amounts 
of iodine compounds to table salt have nearly eliminated these problems 
in North America. Where this program has not been instituted, 
particularly the former Soviet Empire, the Near East and parts of 
Africa, these problems are still severe.</p>
<p>Today, even in North America, the success of this program is 
threatened by a number of factors:
<ul>
<li><b>Processed Foods:</b> &nbsp; People are now getting most of their 
  salt from processed foods. Food processors use cheaper non-iodized 
  salt.</li>
<li><b>Health Programs:</b> &nbsp; People are being urged to cut down the 
  use of table salt, resulting in decreased iodine in the diet.</li>
<li><b>Celebrity Chefs</b>, cookbook and recipe writers catering to the 
  gourmet set. These people imagine they can taste the taint of iodine if 
  they use regular salt and always specify Kosher salt which has no iodine.
  </li>
<li><b>Farmed Fish:</b> &nbsp; Depletion of ocean resources has resulted 
  in a sharp rise in fresh water fish from fish farms - tilapia, catfish, 
  trout and the like. Freshwater fish contains much less iodine than 
  ocean fish. Ocean seafood has always been the major source of dietary 
  iodine in North America and Europe.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sea">Natural Salt &amp; Health</h2>

<p>All salt originates from the rocks and minerals of the Earth's crust, 
leached out by water and carried to oceans and closed lakes where it has 
been concentrated by evaporation. A major change in life on Earth happened 
when Calcium reached saturation in the oceans so living creatures could 
build shells and bones.</p>

<p>Natural salt is either evaporated from seawater, or mined from mineral 
deposits that are the buried remains of dried up salt lakes and inland 
seas. Sea salt varies somewhat from one location to another, but mined 
salt can vary quite a bit due to minerals migrated in and out of it by 
groundwater.</p>

<p>Opinion from dieticians seems to be this, "Salt is salt. It's just 
about all sodium chloride and there's too little of anything else to 
affect nutrition, though it does affect taste." I find it kind of 
difficult to believe that something in sufficient amount to affect 
taste is insufficient to affect trace mineral nutrition.</p>

<p>Recipes for salt fermenting vegetables, for instance Korean kimchee, 
specify natural sea salt (available cheaply and in bulk from Korean 
markets) because trace minerals are important for proper fermentation. 
Impact on health is debatable for the quantities of salt you should be 
eating.</p>

<p>Here are the dry matter compositions of table salt and typical sea 
salt so you can make your own evaluation:</p>

<p>Note that sea salt doesn't contain enough iodine to prevent Iodine 
deficiency, so some natural sea salt is iodized. Seafoods, including 
seaweed do concentrate sufficient iodine from seawater to be significant 
sources. Note that the high "Other" percentage in refined salt is 
usually anti-caking agents.</p>

<p>Note that salt labeled "Sea Salt" from major salt processors may have 
originated from seawater but is typically so refined it might as well be 
called table salt. The processors make more on the chemicals extracted 
from salt than they do on the salt itself, so thorough refining is to 
their advantage.</p>
