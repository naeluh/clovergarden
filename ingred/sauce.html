<span class=bg>Sauces we define here as complex prepared flavorings, 
usually in liquid or paste form, that are pantry (or refirgerator) 
staples and have wide usage in many recipes. Condiments we define as 
sauces that are present on the table for enhancement of many dishes 
as desired by individual diners. Sauces, purchased or home made, 
are present in the cuisines of every culture. </span>

<h2>Adjika</h2>
<br><img src="img/sa_adjika02k.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Adjika" class=mrg>
[Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan]
<p>This extremely tasty Sauce / Condiment / Spread is said to have originated 
in Azerbaijan, but since I live across the street from the western capital of 
Armenia, I list that country first. If I lived in Azerbaijan, I would not 
admit such a thing as Armenia even (or ever) existed. Pagan Armenia was a 
world power, until it converted to Christianity (the first country to do so) 
and went into decline. Imported form Armenia, this Adjika comes in Mild and 
Hot, but the Hot certainly doesn't rate as "Hot" by Southern California 
standards. I don't use the Mild because it's relatively uninteresting. Ingred: 
red hot chili peppers, tomato paste, garlic, vegetable oil, salt, greens.

<h2>Banana Ketchup / Sauce</h2>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Tamis Anghang 
  (Philippine)]
<br><a href="sa_banaketz.html">
<img src="img/sa_banaket01k.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Banana Ketchup" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This product, very popular in the Philippines, is called "Banana Ketchup" 
there, but in the Unites States it must be labeled "Banana Sauce". In 
the U.S. "Ketchup" is a standardized formula and nothing that doesn't 
meet the formula can be called "Ketchup". This was done so 
manufacturers of ketchup didn't have to reveal its extremely high sugar 
content (more sugar than ice cream - that's why the kids like it so much).
</p>
<p>Banana Ketchup is colored red and put up in ketchup style bottles to 
make it more acceptable as a lower cost ketchup substitute. The taste and 
texture are a little different from our ketchup, but not too much. 
Ingred: banana, water, sugar, vinegar, iodized salt, modified starch, 
onion, spices, garlic, 0.08% sodium benzoate (E211) as preservative, 
FD&amp;C Yellow #6 (E110) and FD&amp;C Red #40 (E129) as artificial 
coloring.

<h2>Chili Sauces</h2> 
<br><a href="chilis.html">
<img src="img/sa_chilis02k.jpg" alt="Bottles of Chili Sauces" class=mrg></a>
Found in Central and South America and the Caribbean, chili peppers 
were carried throughout the world by the Spanish (specialzing in milder 
varieties) and Poturguese (specializing in hotter ones). They lend 
themselves to a number of sauces and condiments beyond counting. This 
very important category has its own <a href="chilis.html"><b>Chili 
Sauces &amp; Potions</b></a> page covering some that are particularly 
important in North America.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Fish Sauces</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html">
<img src="img/sf_pdfishsauce02k.jpg" alt="Bottles of Fish Sauces" class=mrg></a>
Fish sauces were as essential to the cuisine of the Roman Empire as they 
are in Southeast Asia today. They are now increasingly important in 
North America, not only because of the increasing popularity of 
Southeast Asian cuisines, but are being incorporated into California 
cuisine, and other innovative cuisines across the continent. This very 
important category has its own <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html"><b>Fish 
Sauces </b></a> page.

<h2>Maggi Seasoning</h2>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
   [Jugo (Mexico), Maggi W&uuml;rze (Germany)]
<br><a href="sa_maggiz.html">
<img src="img/sa_maggi02m.jpg" alt="Small Bottle of Magi Seasoning" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This important seasoning, was invented in India by Mannat Maggi, with 
manufacturing moved to Germany in 1897. It has found a worldwide market 
and you will find it called for in many recipes, especially from 
Southeast Asia, where it is also a table condiment. Its bottle and trade 
dress are widely imitated by Asian knock-offs. It is also very popular 
in Central Europe.</p>
<p>Magi is similar to soy sauce, but formulated to be more of a meat 
broth analog. It originally contained soy, but soy was dropped around 
2000. It is used in soups, stews and sauces, but also in salad dressings 
and vegetable dressings. The brand is now owned by Nestl&eacute;, and 
is distributed in North America by Nestl&eacute; USA.

<h2>Oyster Sauce</h2>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Oyster Flavored Sauce (USA); 
  Dau H&agrave;o (Viet)]
<br><a href="sa_oysterz.html">
<img src="img/sa_oyster02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Oyster Sauce" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This is a very important Chinese sauce, also much used in Thailand, 
Vietnam and Cambodia. It was invented accidentally by Lee Kum Sheung in 
Guangdong in 1888. He founded the Lee Kum Kee company to market it. 
Today it is made by many companies in Asia and elsewhere, in an 
extremely wide range of qualities, some having very little association 
with actual oysters. See <a href="sa_oysterz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a> for details and recommendations.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Shrimp Sauces <small> &amp;</small> Pastes</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pdshrimppaste01k.jpg" alt="Bottles of Fish Sauces" class=mrg></a>
<p>
While well behind Fish Sauces in penetrating Western cuisines, these 
sauces are essential for authentic reproduction of the cuisines of 
coastal China and all of Southest Asia.This very important category 
has its own <a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauces / 
Paste</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Soy Sauces</h2> 
<br><a href="bp_soysz.html">
<img src="img/bp_soys01k.jpg" alt="Regular and Dark Soy Sauces" class=mrg></a>
Techniques for fermenting soybeans to render them non toxic and edible 
were developed in China. A byproduct of making soybean pastes was 
developed into Soy Sauce, an ingredient and condiment soon adopted by 
Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. It has now become quite prominant in 
North America as well. This very important category has its own 
<a href="bp_soysz.html"><b>Soy Sauce</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Yellow Soy Bean Sauce</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Nuoc Tuong (Viet)]
<br><a href="bp_yelbeanz.html">
<img src="img/bp_yelbean16k.jpg" alt="Three Types of Yellow Bean Sauce" class=mrgl></a>
<p>
Sometimes called "Brown Bean Sauce or "Soy Bean Paste", this sauce is 
made from fermented yellow soy beans. It is a very common ingredient 
in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine and available in markets serving 
Southeast Asian communities. The brown one to the left is a reasonable 
substitute for fish sauce in many vegetarian dishes.  This category 
has its own <a href="bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> 
page.

<h2>Thai Curry Pastes</h2> 
<br>
<img src="img/sa_thaitop02k.jpg" alt="Green, Red and Yellow Curry Pastes" class=mrg>
<p>
Curries are very popular in Thailand, but they differ from Indian 
Curries in that they are fresh pastes, not made from dried spices.
Several of them can be had commercially in North America, but all 
are better made at home. The Clovegarden site has recipes for each.
They are listed here in order of popularity in Thailand.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><h3>Red Curry Paste</h3></a>
  &nbsp; [Krueng Gaeng Peht (Thai Paste)] &nbsp; Red are the most popular 
  curries in Thailand, and are in hotness midway between green curries 
  and yellow curries.</li>
<li><a href="sa_thairz.html"><h3>Red Curry Sauces:</h3></a>
  &nbsp; These "convenience" products can't be used in real Thai recipes. 
  They also vary widely in quality.</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/sis_grncurry1.html"><h3>Green Curry Paste:</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; This is the hottest of the Thai pastes, used for Green Curries, 
  second most popular to Red Curries.</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/sis_yellowcurry1.html"><h3>Yellow Curry Paste:</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; The least hot of the Thai curries, yellow curry is a Thai take 
  on Indian curries, but still based on a fresh paste.</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/sis_panangcury1.html"><h3>Panang Curry Paste</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; [Phanaeng, Phanang, Panaeng] &nbsp; from the Malaysian island of 
  Panang, this curry has been enthusiastically adopted by the Thai.</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/sis_masmcurry1.html"><h3>Mussamun Curry Paste:</h3></a> 
  &nbsp; [Massaman, "Muslim curry"] &nbsp; possibly patterned after the 
  rich Mughal cuisine of Hyderabad in India or introduced by Muslim 
  merchants, it is quite different from other Thai curries.</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/sjf_hotsour1.html"><h3>Hot Sour Curry Paste:</h3></a>
  &nbsp; This curry paste is fairly hot, but not sour. It gets its name 
  from the sour soups it is used in.</li>
  </ul> 

<h2>Tomato Ketchup</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Catsup; Kekap (Malay); 
  Ket&ccedil;ap (Turk)]
<br><a href="sa_ketchz.html">
<img src="img/sa_kechup01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Tomato Ketchup" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Ketchup is held in high favor by children, because it has more sugar 
than ice cream - it's sort of tomato flavored candy. By federal law, 
if your product doesn't have that much sugar it can't be called 
"ketchup". This was a ploy by the food industry to "standardize" the 
product so they didn't have to reveal on the label that it was about 
1/3 sugar (other ingredients are water, salt, vinegar, spices, and, yes, 
tomatoes). For details see our 
<a href="sa_ketchz.html"><b>Tomato Ketchup</b></a> page. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Za'atar - Spice Mix</h2> 
<br><a href="mt_zaatz.html">
<img src="img/sp_zaatar05c.jpg" alt="Pile of Zaatar Mix" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This is a very important spice mix in the Levant and Middle East, both 
as an ingredient, and as a table condiment. Supposedly, it is based on 
the herb Za'atar (<i>Origanum syriacum</i>), but most today is made 
from Thyme, Oregano and Marjoram because the supply of Za'atar is 
no longer sufficient. Other ingredients are toasted Sesame Seeds, 
Sumac for sourness, and sometimes salt. Some commercial versions may 
included toasted wheat flour - not good for Celiacs. Some versions 
also include savory, cumin, coriander or fennel, and one distinctly 
Palestinian version includes Caraway seeds. In the region, this mix 
may be also made with fresh herbs. The photo specimen is from our 
Lebanese style recipe <a href="../recipes/myv_zaata1.html"><b>Za'atar 
- Herb Mix</b></a>. See also 
<a href="mt_zaatz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
