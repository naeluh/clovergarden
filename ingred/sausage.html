<span class=bg>
Sausages are basically animal parts chopped or ground up, mixed with 
seasonings and stuffed into the animal's intestine (or reasonable 
facsimile).</span> They may then be cooked, cured, smoked, dried or aged. 
Sausages were originally a method of preserving meat with fat, dryness 
and salt. Today they are made in bewildering variety for their unique 
flavors. For easy navigation, use the Country index on the side bar.

<h2 class=lrg id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="sors">Sausage <small>or</small> Salami?</h2>

<p>Well, technically they're all sausages, but those called "salami" are 
generally drier, firmer, likely saltier, often larger, and can be sliced 
and eaten without cooking. Most salamis are raw and cured by air drying, 
salting and/or smoking, but some are cooked. Some called sausages are 
air dried, cured, salted, and/or smoked and eaten uncooked as well.</p> 

<h2 id="terms">Some General Terms</h2>

<p>Sausages come in three general categories, which have to be handled 
quite differently. 
<ul>
<li><h3>Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; [Chorizo Fresco, etc.] &nbsp; These sausages 
  are made up of raw ingredients and usually of a fairly loose texture. 
  They must be kept well refrigerated and cooked within a few days, even 
  fewer if they contain blood, before eating.</li>
<li><h3>Semi-cured:</h3> &nbsp; These sausages are generally partially 
  dried and may contain more salt (a preservative) than Fresh Sausages, 
  but still must be refrigerated and cooked before eating. They will 
  keep longer refrigerated than Fresh Sausages.</li>
<li><h3>Fully Dry Cured:</h3> &nbsp; These sausages are relatively firm, 
  dry and salty. Many can be stored at room temperature for short 
  periods, but are better refrigerated. They are often just sliced and 
  eaten as appetizers or the like, usually at room temperature, with no 
  cooking required.</li>
<li><h3>Fully Cooked:</h3> &nbsp; These are sausages that have been 
 cooked as part of their production. This cooking may be done as part 
 of a hot smoking process, or separately. These sausages can be eaten 
 without cooking, but need to be kept refrigerated. They are less 
 perishable than Fresh sausages, perhaps even a week or two, and 
 sometimes three, depending. Some vacuum packed varieties will keep 
 refrigerated much longer, until their vacuum seal is broken.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="relig">Religious Considerations</h2>

<p>Jews and Muslims must avoid pork in any form (including sausage 
casings from pigs). Both also may not consume blood, so blood sausages 
are not on their menus. Fully observant Jews must buy their meat and 
sausages from a kosher butcher, and observant Muslims from a halal 
butcher, to assure the animals have been slaughtered and butchered in 
conformance with specified ritual and methods. Kosher meat must be 
salted (that's what kosher salt is for) to remove all traces of blood.
</p>


<h2 id="case">Casings</h2>
<p><img src="img/sg_casepig01e.jpg" alt="Sausage Casings" class=mrg>
Traditionally sausages meats are stuffed into casings made from the 
intestines of pigs, sheep, cows and veal calves. Pig casings are most 
popular but for kosher and halal (Islamic) products manufacturers 
use sheep casings, though they are more difficult to use.</p>
<p>Today volume producers 
prefer an artificial casing made from collagen for product uniformity. 
Collagen is made by boiling down animal hides. Inedible casings are also 
used, particularly for larger size. Fiber casings have a look and feel 
more like natural casings than plastic casings do. "Skinless" products 
like hot dogs and many vegetarian sausages are made in a plastic casing 
which is stripped off after cooking and before packaging.</p>
<p>The photo shows natural pork casings obtained from a local Philippine 
market, about 5-1/2 feet long each and weighing about 0.6 ounce each. 
They are cleaned, heavily salted and must be refrigerated and used within 
a few days. About 1/4 inch wide as shown they will expand to about 1-1/2 
inches diameter when filled.</p>
<p>While natural and collagen casings are easily purchased for making 
meat sausage at home, vegetarians will find there is no casing for them 
and will have to form their sausage into patties, loaves, roll them in 
some substance or other, or wrap them in plastic to be stripped off 
after preliminary cooking. High volume makers of vegetarian sausage 
can use a liquid coating system which produce an effect similar to a 
collagen casing.</p>

<h2>Authenticity</h2>

<p>I list mostly sausages easily and economically available in Southern 
California. Sausages are perishable and expensive to ship, so nearly all 
examples are "made in USA". The vast ethnic communities in this country, 
and particularly in Los Angeles, keep the sausage makers true (they 
usually "came from there" anyway). Most of the examples were obtained 
from markets serving those communities. As the U.S. overtakes 
the Old World quality of wine, cheese and caviar, our sausage makers are 
keeping pace.</p>
<p>Due to changes in U.S. laws, mostly to mollify the Europeans, American 
sausage makers can no longer make, say, a Hungarian Sausage (or any other 
country's sausage), no matter how authentically made, and call it a 
"Hungarian Sausage"&nbsp; - &nbsp;but our sausage makers are resourceful. Instead 
they call it "Hungarian Brand Sausage", which doesn't imply it actually 
came from Hungary.</p> 
<p>Also included are a number of purely authentic American industrial 
products which make no pretense to traditional methods. The ingredient 
list generally starts with "Mechanically separated chicken", has soy 
protein in the middle and ends with "flavoring" and a long list of 
chemicals.</p>

<h2 id="must">Mustard</h2>

<p>Many sausages are grilled or fried and eaten with mustard. I have 
tried any number of mustards, fancy and plain. Many clash with or 
distract from the sausage. Economical mustards I've found excellent with 
sausages are French's Spicy Brown Mustard, Morehouse Deli Mustard and 
Gulden's Spicy Mustard.</p>

<p><br></p>


<h2 class=lrg id="var">Varieties</h2>

<p>We have re-organized this page to place sausages in a country of 
origin context. If you want to find a sausage by name, use the search 
engine. Most of the sausages listed are made in North America, but 
accurately reflect those from the country of origin. Most of the 
sausage makers "came from there", and our huge ethnic populations keep 
them honest. We have made no attempt to track down exotic sausages&nbsp; - &nbsp;
all listed here were conveniently available in Los Angeles, California.
</p>

   
<h2 id="amern">America &nbsp; - &nbsp;North</h2>

<p>This region, with a temperate climate, is home to a very wide range 
of ethnic cultures from all over the world. Nearly all the sausages on 
this page were made in North America, but here we list only ones that 
are unique to the continent or so far removed from their ethnic origin 
as to be "inauthentic".</p>

   <h3>Andouille</h3>&nbsp; - &nbsp;(Fully Cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_andou01e.jpg" alt="Andouille Sausages, whole and cut" class=mrg>
   Pronounced "ahn-DOO-wee", it's a pork sausage in the Cajun / Creole 
   style of Louisiana, USA, and used for recipes from that area. It is 
   said to be descended from the sausages of Normandy and Brittany 
   France,  which in turn may descend from similar German sausages. This 
   is one of the few "hot" sausages that actually take that designation 
   seriously. Commercial versions are smaller in diameter than 
   traditionally made, the meat chopped finer, and not smoked nearly as 
   long so are lighter in color. The photo specimens (commercial) were 
   fully cooked, 5 inches long, 1.2 inches in diameter and weighed 3 
   ounces each. 200 calories / link, 75% from fat. They need to be kept 
   refrigerated and should be used within just a few days from opening 
   the vacuum package. Typically: pork, water, salt, spices, garlic, 
   paprika, other flavorings, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2 id="bolog">Bologna</h2> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_bolog01e.jpg" alt="Bologna Slices, several sizes" class=mrg>
   Properly pronounced "baloney", this is an American imitation of the 
   Italian Mortadella (also adopted by Russia under the name 
   <a href="sausage.html#doct">Doctorskaya Kielbasa</a>). It's a very finely ground, 
   fully cooked sausage sold in various sizes and shapes, and often in 
   pre-sliced packages. Large sizes are used for making sandwiches and 
   small sizes for frying for breakfast and similar uses. In northeastern 
   Canada a fried or barbecued slab of bologna is called a "Newfie Steak".  
   A similar sausage is made in Australia and variously called Polony, 
   Fritz, Devon or Strasbourg.

   NutritionData</a>.
   <br class=cll><p></p>
   <p>As an imitation mortadella, bologna is properly made of pork and 
   lard, but in the U.S. it is also made of chicken, turkey, beef and 
   (may the gods save us) GMO soybeans. The photo specimens are:</p>
  <ul>
     <li><b>Mikailian Meat Products</b>, Valencia, California: 2-1/2 inch 
       diameter. This product fries well and browns quickly. Pork, water, 
       beef, nonfat dry milk, salt, dextrose, sodium phosphate, spices, 
       garlic paprika, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), sodium nitrite.</li>
     <li><b>Red Square</b>, Somerset, New Jersey: 4-3/4 inch diameter, 
       also labeled "Doctorskaya" (in Cyrillic). This product fries up 
       quite light due to a lot of incorporated air bubbles. Pork, water 
       salt sodium erythorbate, white pepper, sodium phosphate, sodium 
       nitrate, paprika.</li>
     <li><b>Oscar Mayer</b>, Madison Wisconsin: 4-1/4 inch diameter, a 
       leading supermarket brand, pre-sliced for sandwiches. When fried 
       this product dries out badly and has little flavor.  Mechanically 
       separated chicken, pork, water, corn syrup, salt, sodium lactate, 
       flavor (whatever that might be), sodium phosphate, autolyzed yeast, 
       sodium diacetate, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite, dextrose, 
       extractives of paprika, potassium phosphate, sugar, potassium 
       chloride.</li>
     </ul>
   <p><u>Cooking:</u> Bologna is commonly sliced fairly thin and used in 
   sandwiches with no further cooking, but it is also often fried. When 
   frying a cut is usually made from one side to the center or in 
   "fireman's badge" form, because it otherwise tends to buckle badly. It 
   exudes little oil, so it needs some oil in the pan for heat transfer. 
   Bologna is also used as a wrap around mashed potatoes and baked, and in 
   many other ways.</p>
   <p><u>Storing:</u> Bologna should always be kept well refrigerated and 
   should be used within 7 days of opening a vacuum package.</p>

   <h3>Boudin Blanc</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     [Louisiana; also Boudin Rouge]
   <br><img src="img/sg_boudw01h.jpg" alt="Long Boudin Sausage" class=mrg>
   <p>
   I have placed Boudin Blanc here rather than under France because it 
   is made differently in Louisiana. In Cajun and Creole cooking the 
   word "boudin" always means Boudin Blank, unless otherwise specified. 
   In France it is made of pork, with heart and liver often included, 
   and milk. In Louisiana it is always made with pork and rice. The 
   equivalent to France's Boudin Noir (Blood Sausage) is Boudin Rouge, 
   which is Boudin Blanc with pig blood added.

   <h3 id=braun>Braunschweiger</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_braun04h.jpg" alt="Section of American Braunschweiger" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Despite its very German name, this soft spreadable pork and pork liver 
   (minimum 30% liver) sausage is an American sausage. It is very similar 
   to <a href="sausage.html#liverw">Liverwurst</a>, but smoked and/or including cured 
   bacon for a deeper flavor. German <a href="sausage.html#braunm">Braunschweiger</a> 
   is very different, though it is spreadable. The main use of this 
   sausage is as a sandwich spread. Braunschweiger is highly perishable, 
   should be kept well refrigerated and eaten in less than a week. The 
   photo specimen, made by <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, 
   was 3 inches diameter. Typically pork, pork liver, cured bacon, salt, 
   water, flavorings, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Breakfast Links</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh)
   <br><img src="img/sg_break01e.jpg" alt="American Breakfast Links" class=mrg>
   The common American breakfast sausage served in diners and hotels. The 
   photo specimens are <a href="sausage.html#s04">Farmer John</a> brand produced by a major 
   Los Angeles pork factory. These fry up quickly because of their small 
   diameter, brown well and are tasty due to the high fat content. Quite a bit 
   of fat is rendered while frying. The specimens are 3-1/2 inches long by 
   0.66 inch diameter, weigh about 1 ounce each. 50 calories / link, 70% from 
   fat. These have a thin casing and are simply formed at the ends and cut 
   rather than twisted. There are versions without casings that are simply 
   extruded and cut to length but those don't fry as nicely. Typically: pork, 
   water, sodium lactate, salt, flavorings, sugar and collagen casings.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h3>Chub Sausage</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Fresh) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     [Chub Sausage, Country Pork Sausage]
   <br><img src="img/sg_breakchub01e.jpg" alt="American Chub Sausage" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is a form of sausage packaging used primarily for soft sausage 
   that will be crumbled, spread or formed into patties, but firmer 
   sausages can also be described as "chubs". A Chub is generally short 
   and thick with common sizes of 12 oz, 1 pound and 2 pound. The casing 
   is generally non-edible plastic or fiber sealed with metal rings at 
   the ends&nbsp;  - &nbsp; a packaging highly suited to volume production. It is 
   usually a simple pork "breakfast" sausage. A version flavored with 
   sage is often used in turkey stuffings and similar applications.</p>   
   <p> The photo specimen, by <a href="sausage.html#s10">Jimmy Dean</a> was a 2-1/2 
   inch diameter 1 pound chub. Pork, water, salt, spices, sugar, corn 
   syrup, monosodium glutamate. Calories are figured on a 2 ounce 
   <u>cooked</u> sample which would have been 2.6 ounces raw and 
   disregards fat left in the pan&nbsp;  - &nbsp; 220 calories, 86% from fat.

   <br><img src="img/sg_danger02e.jpg" alt="Three Danger Dogs" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Danger Dogs get their name from the street vendors of Tijuana, not 
   always the most mindful of bacteria. It has become quite popular in 
   Southern California and other Southwest states where you can buy them 
   from street vendors at practically any event that draws a crowd. You 
   can also buy them (in relative safety) in supermarkets and fry them 
   up yourself. Danger dogs are served in a bun with grilled onions and 
   chili sauce or topped with mayonnaise. Danger Dogs have also surfaced 
   as the <a href="sausage.html#jersey">Jersey Breakfast Dog</a>, far more dangerous 
   than the original.

   <h3 id=hdog>Hot Dogs</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Fresh) &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Franks, 
   Wieners, Weenies, Frankfurters]
   <br><img src="img/sg_wiener06e.jpg" alt="Various Hot Dogs" class=mrg>
   <p>
   The most popular sausage in North America, it is the American version 
   of the German <a href="sausage.html#wiener"><b>Wiener</b></a>.  The origin of the 
   name "hot dog" is highly controversial but seems to have appeared in 
   the late 1800s. The hot dog very much resembles 
   <a href="sausage.html#bolog">Bologna</a> in texture and flavor, but tends to be a 
   bit more distinctly seasoned and may be lightly smoked. Today it is 
   usually made "skinless", cooked in a plastic casing which is peeled 
   off before packaging, but a few are still made with natural casings.
   </p>
   <p>These are made primarily of pork but may also contain beef, 
   chicken, turkey or any mix of those. All beef versions are made for 
   the kosher market and "more healthful" Turkey and chicken versions 
   are also made, as well as <a href="sausage.html#vegi">Vegetarian</a> versions, 
   generally from TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) and various other 
   chemically processed ingredients.</p>
   <p>In the photo, the specimens in the front are typical American 
   hot dogs (the others are European style Wieners). 
   The American, by <a href="sausage.html#s04">Farmer John</a> were skinless, 4.8 
   inches long, 7/8 inch diameter and 1-1/2 ounces each&nbsp;  - &nbsp; 140 calories 
  &nbsp;  - &nbsp; 86% from fat. Claiming "No Fillers, No Byproducts", they were made 
   from: pork, mechanically separated turkey, water, salt, corn syrup, 
   natural flavorings, dextrose, sugar, potassium lactate, 
   sodium phosphates, beef, sodium erythorbate, oleoresin, paprika, 
   sodium nitrite.</p>
   <p>Compared to the European style, the Farmer John are quite salty 
   and had a stronger, coarsest flavor. They were easier to fry or roast 
   because they're very straight and skinless, but they end up a bit dry. 
   The European are much plumper, lighter and juicier with casing helping 
   to keep them moist. Simmered, the coarseness of the Farmer John flavor 
   was more noticeable, but, unlike the European, they don't tend to split 
   open.

   <h3 id="jersey">Jersey Breakfast Dog</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
     (Street Vendor cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_jerseybreakfast01h.jpg" alt="Jersey Breakfast Dog" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is a New Jersey adaptation of the <a href="sausage.html#danger">Danger Dog</a>. 
   Following the hot dog tradition of New Jersey, they are deep fried 
   rather than grilled or pan fried. Breakfast Dogs are served on a bun 
   with a fried egg and melted cheese under them, which looks far more 
   deadly than the original Danger Dog. This formula is derived from the 
   Jersey Breakfast Sandwich, made from 
   <a href="sausage.html#njpr">Jersey Pork Roll</a> rather than hot dogs. Other 
   New Jersey forms of deep fried hot dogs (without bacon) are "in and 
   outers" (fried until lightly blistered) and "rippers" (fried until 
   they split wide open). <small>Photo copyright Jason Perlow, all

   <h3 id="njpr">Jersey Pork Roll</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Semi Cured)

   <br><a href="sg_njprz.html">
   <img src="img/sg_njpr11e.jpg" alt="Jersey Pork Roll" class=mrg></a>
   <p>
   This "King of Mystery Meats" is made from secret recipes by several 
   companies in or around Trenton, New Jersey. Maker John Taylor has 
   become sufficiently dominant to make "Taylor Ham" a common (though 
   now illegal) alternative name to Jersey Pork Roll, but some 
   connoisseurs prefer products from smaller makers.</p>
   <p>The recipes may be secret, but one thing is for sure, salt. Enough 
   salt so I think the product is eternal - even mold doesn't grow on it.  
   Several sellers ship pork roll to most points in the U.S. packed in 
   styrofoam with frozen gel packs. The photo specimen (4 inch diameter, 
   4 pounds) was shipped to me UPS 3rd day ground courtesy Mike Vitale 
   (Yendor). The most famous use for Pork Roll is the

   <h3>Kielbasa &nbsp; - &nbsp; U.S.</h3> (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
   [Polish Sausage, Keilbasa]
   <br><img src="img/sg_polish01h.jpg" alt="American Kielbasa" class=mrg>
   <p>
   A cooked and generally lightly smoked sausage sort of resembling one 
   made in Poland. Generally about 18 inches long and bent into a "U" 
   shape but other sizes are also made. The closest Polish equivalent is 
   Wiejska, which translates roughly to "country one", which is made of 
   pork and veal and generally sold in the familiar "U" shape.</p>
   <p>In Poland they would be made from better cuts of pork and veal,

   <br><img src="img/sg_lebanon01h.jpg" alt="Lebanon Bologna Slices" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Named for the Lebanon Valley of Pennsylvania where it was developed by 
   German immigrants, this salami went into commercial production in 1885. 
   A truly American salami with a distinct and memorable flavor, it is 
   still made primarily in the Lebanon Valley. Three major manufacturers 
   using traditional methods, are <a href="sausage.html#s15">Weavers</a>, 
   <a href="sausage.html#s13">Seltzer's</a> and <a href="sausage.html#s14">Kutztown</a>. Made 
   from beef and salt, Lebanon bologna is fermented and aged for at least 
   10 days, some of that time overlapping a slow smoking process. The 
   photo specimen, by Seltzer's, is the standard 4-1/4 inch diameter 
   American sliced sandwich meat format, though other sizes are made. 
   Beef, salt, sugar, dextrose, spices, lactic acid starter culture, 
   sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite. 40 calories per slice, 50% from 
   fat.

   As far as I've found, Bar M Packers of Los Angeles is the only maker 
   of "Penn Sausage" and they make two varieties, "mild" and "hot". The 
   mild still has a bit of hotness to it and the hot is much hotter. 
   4-1/4 inches long, 1 inch diameter, 2-1/4 ounces each. Pork, beef 
   hearts, water, salt, corn syrup, flavorings, dextrose, sodium 
   phosphate, paprika, garlic, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite.

   A hard. spicy, fermented American salami more or less in the style of 
   southern Italy (in Italy "pepperoni" is a bell pepper). While it can 
   be eaten raw, this imitation of the Italian <i>salsiccia Napoletana 
   piccante</i> is the most popular topping for American style pizzas and 
   is used in other recipes. The photo specimens, Margherita brand 
   (ConAgra Foods, Downers Grove, Illinois), were 10 inches long, 
   1-3/8 inches in diameter and weighed about 6-3/4 ounces each. 
   Typically: pork, beef, salt, dextrose, flavoring, lactic acid starter 
   culture, paprika sodium nitrite, spices, BHA, BHT, citric acid. 140 
   calories per ounce, 86% from fat. Keep dry and refrigerated.

   <br><img src="img/sg_summer01e.jpg" alt="Summer Sausage w/Slices" class=mrg>
   <p>
   Basically an American cervelat, a family of mildly seasoned semi-soft 
   salamis, fermented, generally smoked and fully cooked. Commercially 
   they are made from pork or pork and beef or beef, but are a favorite 
   with home sausage makers who often make them with game meats.  This 
   "ready to eat" sausage is fairly durable but should be kept 
   refrigerated and eaten within 7 days or so of breaking the vacuum 
   pack. The photo sample, by <a href="sausage.html#s06">Hilshire Farm</a>, was 
   13-1/2 inches long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 2 pounds but 
   they also make one 14 inches long, 2-3/4 inches diameter and 3 pounds. 
   Beef and Pork, salt, natural spices, dextrose lactic acid starter 
   culture, flavorings, sodium ascorbate (vitamin C), Sodium Nitrite; 95

   <p>
   This salami is patterned on the recipe for an old European salami made 
   in the autumn at hog slaughtering time, serving as winter provisions. 
   It is finely ground and very distinctively spiced. <a href="sausage.html#s39">
   Black Kassel</a> brand. 7-1/2 inches long, 1-1/2 inch diameter and

   <br><img src="img/sg_vienna01e.jpg" alt="Vienna Sausages?" class=mrg>
   In the USA "Vienna Sausage" means these lamentable things. Somewhat 
   smaller than a cocktail wiener they are fully cooked and almost always 
   packed in cans. Nearly devoid of flavor they are mushy straight from 
   the can, but not nearly as mushy as they'll be if you fry them. The 
   only excuse for their existence is the long shelf life of cans. They 
   are a pantry stapel in Puerto Rico. The "Major Brand Name" samples 
   in the photo were 2-1/4 inch long, 3/4 inch in diameter and weighed 
   just over 1/2 ounce each. Mechanically separated chicken, chicken 
   broth, water, beef, pork, salt, sugar, spices, sodium erythorbate,

   <h3 id="chorim">Chorizo de Puerco, Mexican</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Fresh)
   <br><img src="img/sg_chorizm02e.jpg" alt="Mexican Chorizo" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This ia a version of Chorizo Fresco, but is <u>not at all 
   interchangeable</u> with any form of "Chorizo" from Spain, Portugal, 
   Central America, South America, the Caribbean, or the Philippines, 
   regardless of the name. It is heavily spiced with chilis rather than 
   lightly spiced with paprika. Commercial brands tend to be a dumping 
   ground for parts of the pig that can't be unloaded any other way. 
   I've seen commercial brands where the top two ingredients are 
   "pork salivary glands, lymph nodes". The photo specimen was "store 
   made" by Vallarta Supermarket, a specialist in Mexican, Central 
   American and South American foods, so you can be pretty sure it's 
   "authentic". Ingred: Pork, California chilis, vinegar, cloves, pepper, 
   ginger, cumin, garlic, salt. Note the absence of salivary glands or 
   lymph nodes.</p>
   <p><b>Buy:</b> &nbsp; Purchase only "store made" from a market that 
   serves a Latino community. All the packaged products I've examined 
   are totally inferior. This sausage is removed from its casing, then 
   crumbled as it cooks. It should fry up crumbly with very little
   exuded fat - <u>not</u> disintegrating into mush swimming in a pool 
   of bright orange fat as some of the commercial versions do. It is 
   quite red in color but only moderately hot. Unfortunately, the pork 
   flavor is difficult to detect under the chili and spices. It is 
   perishable; keep refrigerated and use in less than a week.

   <br><img src="img/sg_argent04e.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Argentine Chorizo" class=mrg>
   <p>This Chorizo is usually made of pork, but  beef may be included, 
   and there are all beef versions. It is usually flavored with wine or 
   vinegar, paprika and/or chili, oregano or other herbs and sometimes 
   nutmeg. The Uruguayan may vary slightly in seasoning, but so does the 
   Argentine - consider them interchangeable. For a long thin version see 
   <a href="sausage.html#parr">Salchicha Parrillera</a>.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens were not very sliceable raw, but firmed up 
   with wet cooking and could then be easily sliced. They were 5.2 inch 
   long, 1.3 inch diameter and weighted 4-1/4 ounces, "store made" by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s37">Vallarta Supermarket</a>. Ingred: Pork, California

   <br><img src="img/sg_chorizsp07e.jpg" alt="Salvadoran Chorizos, whole and cut" class=mrg>   
   <p>
   This Salvadoran peasant style chorizo is currently quite popular here 
   in Southern California. Strips of corn husk tie off the links, which 
   have more internal integrity than the Mexican chorizo, and it firms 
   up a bit with wet cooking. It can be sliced before frying if desired, 
   but can still be crumbled easily. It doesn't bleed as much of that 
   awful red color as the Mexican, but has a similar chili bite from 
   less of a hotter chili. It releases a moderate amount of fat when 
   fried, and in my opinion, has much better flavor than Mexican 
   Chorizo.</p>
   <p>The photo specimins were store brand, made in bulk by a sausage 
   factory in Los Angeles. Thery were typically 3-1/4 inches long, 1-1/2

   <h3>Chorizo Verdi</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (fresh)
   <br><img src="img/sg_verde04e.jpg" alt="Whole and cut Chorizo Verde" class=mrg>
   This chorizo originated from Toluca, a major chorizo making 
   region about 38 miles southwest of Mexico City. Made in the region, 
   it is a dull green, but outside the region it is often dyed a 
   brilliant green. Recipes vary by sausage maker. Some are much more 
   complex, and may contain several greens besides cilantro.

   <p>It is interesting to note that the maker of the photo specimen 
   now makes a more authentic sausage than they did a year and a 
   half ago. Then it was a brilliant blue-green and ground very fine. 
   Although they haven't changed the ingredient list, they now make 
   them with fresh Jalapenos rather than powder, grind them much more 
   coarse, and there is very little evidence of dyes. These can be wet 
   cooked in the casing, but when the casing is cut they will burst 
   apart.</p>

   <p>The photo specimens were typically 3.4 inches long, 1.3 inches 
   diameter and weighed 2 ounces each.  "Store made" by <a href="sausage.html#s37">

   Similar to Mexican <a href="sausage.html#chorim">Chorizo</a>, this sausage is 
   <u>NOT</u> interchangeable with sausages called "longaniza" from 
   any other region. This sausage is a little firmer than Mexican 
   chorizo. It can be sliced, preferably partially frozen, but will 
   not firm up much with wet cooking and will look ragged. It may 
   crumble a bit when fried. It releases a fair amount of fat with a 
   strong red-orange color, but not so much as Mexican Chorizo, and 
   it's a bit spicier.<p></p>
   <p>The photo specimens were a store brand, made in bulk by a 
   sausage factory in Los Angeles. These were 7-3/4 inches long, 1-1/8 
   inches diameter and weighed about 4-7/8 ounces each.  
   Typical ingred: Pork, California chili, vinegar, cloves, pepper, 
   ginger, cumin, garlic, salt. 12% fat. Preferably buy locally made 
   store brands&nbsp;  - &nbsp; the big meat packers use the cheapest possible 
   ingredients, often including Salivary Glands and Lymph Nodes 
   (always check their labels). The photo specimens were purchased from

   <p>
   Chinese sausages are thin, wrinkled, rather dry, rather sweet pork 
   sausages traditionally packaged in pairs. They are usually used as an 
   ingredient in recipes. The FDA requires packages to be marked "to be 
   cooked before serving". I doubt this message is universally obeyed. 
   I know I've eaten plenty of them uncooked, but only ones made in 
   USA. The flavor is unique and there is no ready substitute.<p>
   <p>These sausages are manufactured by the millions in the West Coast 
   states to supply the huge Asian communities here, so few, if any, are 
   imported. Asians around here don't much trust foods made in China - 
   they like their sausages unleaded. The photo specimens, made in 
   Seattle, Washington, were 6 inches long by 0.8 inches in diameter and 
   weighed 1.6 ounces each. 240 calories per link, 79% from fat. They are 
   generally sold in vacuum packages and will keep, refrigerated, a long 
   time that way, but once opened should be used in a week or so. 
   Typically: pork, pork fat, sugar, soy sauce, salt, grain alcohol, 
   sodium nitrite, sodium erythorbate.

   The name Soondae, or Sundae, covers a class of blood sausages made in

   noodles and sweet rice. In Korea there are many varieties, as many as 
   there are regions and then some, but here in Los Angeles the selection 
   is much more limited. The manufacturer of the photo specimens 
   recommends heating them still in their unopened shrink wrapped plastic 
   bags by submerging in just boiled water for 5 minutes or so. They can 
   also be steamed. They have a mild meaty flavor and a somewhat 
   gelatinous texture from the noodles.</p>

   few items from French culinary culture, interpreting them in a uniquely 
   Vietnamese way. One of these is Charcuterie, including the making of 
   sausages. Some of these sausages are very important to the making of 
   Vietnam's famous <a href="../recipes/swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Mi 
   Sandwiches</b></a>, so for easy linking we have given them their own

   This is a sour cured pork sausage with rice, originating in the 
   northeast of Thailand (Issan), but now popular in Bancock and other 
   cities. The photo specimens were 1.1 inches diameter and 4-3/4 inches 
   long, weighing 2.9 ounces each, but I have seen photos of them from 
   Thailand being much shorter, more like 2 inches. Glass noodles are 
   also sometimes included there. These sausages have excellent flavor 
   and are usually grilled. They are firm with some chewy spots inside.
   <p>The photo specimens were made in 
   California by <a href="sausage.html#s40">Champ Meatball Company</a>. Ingred:
   Pork, water, long grain rice (enriched with Iron (ferric orthophosphate),

<p>Filipinos are very fond of sausages, and any Philippine market here 
in Southern California is very well stocked with freshly made varieties. 
While I'm sure the Filipinos use some Chinese sausages, most of their 
sausages are of Spanish decent, but interpreted in an entirely 
Philippine way. In particular, the name Longanisa is used for 
sausages that would be called Chorizo Fresco in Spain.</p>

   <h3>Chorizo de Bilbao</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Semi Cured) &nbsp;  - 
   &nbsp; [(Spain - Basque)]
   <br><img src="img/sg_chorbilb01e.jpg" alt="Philippine Chorizo Bilbao" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This cooking chorizo is very popular in the Philippines, and all 
   the Philippine markets have it in the freezer cases. It differs 
   somewhat from the Basque original, being ground finer and doesn't 
   use Spanish paprika. All the brands in the markets here in Los Angeles 
   are made in USA, but given our huge Philippine community, they are 
   probably pretty close to how they are made in the Philippines.</p> 
   <p>This sausage is mildly spicy and works well in soups and stews, 
   holding its shape well in wet cooking. When fried, it exudes a lot 
   of fat, so you'll probably need to pour some off if, say, making 
   sausage &amp; eggs. The photo specimens were distributed by Martin 
   Pure Foods of Walnut, CA. They were 4-1/2 inches long, 1-1/4 inches 
   in diameter and weighed 2.5 ounces. Ingrd: Pork, beef, salt, paprika, 
   dextrose, flavorings, monosodium glutamate, lactic acid starter 
   culture, citric acid, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite.

     &nbsp; [Hotsilog (Tagalog)]
   <br><img src="img/sg_hdph04e.jpg" alt="Philippine Red Hotdogs" class=mrg>
   <p>
   In the Philippines, hotdogs are usually bright red, and spelled without 
   a space. Street vendors always serve them with Banana Ketchup, making 
   them unacceptably sweet to most non-Filipinos. Some recommend demanding 
   mustard instead, even though the vendor will look at you like you're 
   some sort of idiot. Some vendors string the jumbo sized ones on a 
   bamboo skewer and cut them in a spiral, stretching them out a little 
   so they cook evenly. A marshmallow is often added to one end, or both 
   ends, of the skewer. They are a major ingredient in the very popular 
   Philippine Spaghetti, also served with an unacceptably sweet sauce 
   made from ground pork and beef, tomato sauce, banana ketchup and 
   coarsely chopped red hotdogs.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens were from a large Philippine market in 
   Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). They had a distinct note of nutmeg in the 
   flavor. The red color is traditionally from annato, but most makers 
   now use red food coloring. These are skinless and fry brown very 
   quickly. The photo specimens were "Jumbo" size, 1 inch diameter and 
   6 inches long, weighing 2.6 ounces each; regular size, 3/4 inch 
   diameter and 4-1/2 inches long, weighing 1.2 ounces each; "Cocktail" 
   size, 5/8 inch diameter, 2 inches long, weighing 0.36 ounce each. 
   The two larger sizes were 2014 US $3.99 / pound and the Cocktail 
   size at $4.99 / pound.  Beef, pork, water, modified food starch, 
   dextrose, soy sauce powder, sodium erythorbate, paprika oleoresin, 
   sodium nitrite, FD&amp;C Red #40.

   <p>
   "Longaniza" in the Philippines <u>is not similar</u> to Longaniza in 
   Spain&nbsp; or Portugal  - it would be called Chorizo Fresco in other 
   Spanish speaking regions of the world. It is generally made up into 
   short links about 1-1/4 inch in diameter and about 2 ounces each The 
   photo samples were obtained from Philippine markets in Los Angeles, 
   one labeled "Native" (natural) and the other labeled "Hot". This 
   sausage is usually stripped of its casing and crumbled for use.

   <h3>Longanisa Hamonado</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Semi Cured)
   <br><img src="img/sg_hamonado02e.jpg" alt="Longanisa Hamonado" class=mrg>
   <p>
   "Ham cured" longaniza is a rather uniquely flavored sweet, smoked 
   pork sausage made in the Philippines. In Southern California, 
   Philippine markets also sell Chicken Hamonado sausages but I don't 
   know if they make those in the Philippines. This sausage is cooked 
   whole or sliced rather than crumbled. It exudes rather little fat and 
   stays quite firm with wet cooking, so can be used in soups and stews. 
   The photo specimen links were 4-1/2 inches long and weigh 2.1 ounces 
   each, purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock), 
   2014 US $3.49 / pound.

   This famous sausage is made in the northern region of the Philippines, 
   from pork or pork and beef, plenty of garlic, salt and the local 
   <a href="sours.html#ilocos">Ilocos vinegar</a>. This sausage may be 
   cooked whole or stripped of its casing and crumbled. It is often 
   pierced well with a fork, then simmered in a pan with water to almost 
   cover, until the water has all evaporated, then it fries in it's own 
   fat until browned. The photo specimens, obtained from a Philippine 
   market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock), were about 3 inches 
   long by 1.1 inches in diameter and weighed about 1.3 ounces each. 
   These sausages can be kept refrigerated for about 6 days or frozen 
   for about 6 months.

   This famous sausage is made in the Vigan region of the northern 
   Philippines from pork, pork fat, garlic, salt, the local 
   <a href="sours.html#ilocos">Ilocos vinegar</a> and soy sauce for 
   color. It is then hung up to dry for a while. It is fairly dry and 
   can be sliced rather than crumbled but still needs to be cooked. 
   It is often pierced well with a fork, then simmered in a pan with 
   water to almost cover, until the water has all evaporated, then 
   it fries in it's own fat until browned. It is eaten with a dip of 
   Iloco vinegar. The photo specimens, obtained from a Philippine 
   market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock), were about 3 inches 
   long by 1.1 inches in diameter and weighed about 1.3 ounces each. 
   These sausages can be kept refrigerated for about 6 days or frozen 
   for about 6 months.

   <h3>Banger</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh)  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [England]
   <br><img src="img/sg_banger01e.jpg" alt="Banger Sausages" class=mrg>
   This is your basic British pub sausage. Bangers are thick, so if 
   purchased fresh they should be simmered about 10 minutes to cook 
   through, just as with bratwurst (and as with bratwurst I usually 
   simmer in beer). Once cooked through they are grilled, roasted or 
   fried to get a crisp skin. Bangers are a very mild fine textured 
   sausage with a hint of sage. Much of the flavor comes from a well 
   browned exterior. The name "banger" comes from Word War II scarcity 
   in England. The sausages were made with extra water and filler to 
   stretch ingredients, and tended to explode when cooked.
   <p>British commercial brands are generally about 65% pork (up to half 
   of which can be fat) and 30% rusk (dried yeast-free bread) but 
   traditional butchers may use up to 90% pork. Seasonings are generally 
   sage, onion salt and spices. The photo specimens, made in California 
   by <a href="sausage.html#s09">Papa Cantella's</a>, follow "best practices" with 
   just 10% rusk. They were 5-1/4 inches long, 1-1/4 inch in diameter 
   and weighed 3-3/8 ounces&nbsp; - &nbsp; pork, water, rusk, salt, 
   dextrose, spices and hydrolized pork stock. 280 calories per link,

   This blood sausage is popular in the British Isles, made from pork, 
   pork fat, onions, oatmeal, flavorings and blood (usually pig blood). 
   It is made in various diameters and widely use throughout the region, 
   particularly for breakfast. Blood sausages are very perishable, 
   should be kept well refrigerated and used immediately. The photo 
   specimen,  made by <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, was 
   1-5/8 inches in diameter, weighed 5-1/2 ounces and cost 2017 
   US $4.81 / pound. This apears to be slightly smaller diameter than 
   what usually appears in an English breakfast. It is usually fried 
   up in slices and has just enough internal integrity to hold together.

   <p>
   This is the national dish of Scotland, often served with great 
   ceremony. It is a sheep stomach stuffed with chopped sheep lungs, 
   heart and liver, mixed with onions, oatmeal, suet, spices and salt, 
   moistened with stock. It is usually simmered for about 3 hours before 
   serving. It is usually accompanied by "neeps and tatties" (turnips and 
   potatoes, separately mashed) and scotch whisky. It is generally 
   thought to have originated in Scotland, but it's remotely possible 
   the Scots could have learned it from the Romans. Commercial Haggis is 
   usually made in a regular sausage casing rather than as sheep's 
   stomach.</p>
   <p>I have a book in which the author says the worst haggis he ever 
   tasted was in Italy, but does not blame it on Italy, because the best 
   haggis he ever tasted was at a restaurant nearby. The proprietor of 
   that restaurant said he learned to make it from the cook of a British 
   destroyer, at the end of World War II.

   and in the American Midwest, particularly Wisconsin and Ohio where large 
   numbers of Germans settled. These sausages are usually made from pork or 
   pork and veal but sometimes from pork and beef. Originally from the region

      ends up roasted or grilled. Since it is fairly thick it should be 
      pre-cooked by simmering in beer or broth until cooked through 
      before roasting. The photo specimens, by <a href="sausage.html#s09">Papa 
      Cantella's</a> were 5-3/4 inches long, 1-1/8 inch in diameter and

       <p>
       This German pork sausage is thinner and more intensely spiced 
       (usually including fresh marjoram) than most versions of bratwurst, 
       and it has more texture than some. The photo specimen from 
       <a href="sausage.html#s08">Continental Gourmet Sausage Co.</a> was 8 inches 
       long by 0.95 inches in diameter and weighed 3-1/4 ounces. In 
       Germany they are thinner and more like 3 to 3-1/2 inches long, 
       weighing a little less than an ounce, and are EU PGI protected 
       to N&uuml;rnberger

       This sausage is fully cooked but the smoking process uses dry heat 
       and produces a normal brown product rather than white. The photo

       <br><img src="img/sg_bratm02h.jpg" alt="Meter Long Bratwurst" class=mrg>
       <p>
       This sausage was first served in 1953, in Sulzfeld, Bavaria, by 
       sausage maker Lawrence Stark, in response to a comment by a hungry 
       customer that he could eat a meter of bratwurst. In 1999, Andreas 
       Sch&auml;fer ate 5.60 meters with side dishes. The photo specimen
       was made in California, specifically for the Trader Joe's grocery 
       chain. Their publicity tried to make it look like they'd invented 
       the whole idea of a long, curled sausage. 40 inches long, 1 inch 
       diameter, weighing 26 ounces: pork, beef, Trader Joe's vintage 
       ale, (water, malted barley, hops, spices wheat), seasonings 
       (salt, spices, sugar, paprika), vinegar, in natural pork casings, 
       25% fat. This sausage is dark in color and rather perisheable due 
       to not using nitrites, to satisfy their "health concious" yuppie 
       customers.

   <h3>Bockwurst</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh or Fully Cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_bokwurst01e.jpg" alt="Bokwurst whole and cut" class=mrg>
   <p>
   A German sausage traditionally made of veal and pork but heavier on 
   the veal, but even in Germany now made with chicken, turkey, lamb and 
   sometimes horse. It is lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika 
   and sometimes other seasonings, has a natural casing and in Germany is 
   sometimes smoked.  Its name comes from a tradition of eating it with 
   bock beer (and spicy mustard). It is generally cooked by simmering, 
   but if over cooked it will split open so the trick is to pull it just 
   before it splits. The photo specimen (cooked, Safeway branded, maker 
   unknown) was 5 inches by 1-1/4 inch and weighed 3.5 ounces each. Veal, 
   pork, water, soy protein concentrate, salt, spices, onion powder,

   <br><img src="img/sg_braunm01e.jpg" alt="Braunschweiger Mettwurst" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This German soft spreadable sausage, named for the town of 
   Braunschweig, is very different from <a href="sausage.html#braun">American 
   Braunschweigher</a> (except both are spreadable). It is generally 
   made of raw pork, and lightly smoked, but not enough to be completely 
   cooked. It can be cooked or fried, but is often spread on rye bread 
   and eaten raw (the Germans have long enjoyed raw pork). 
   Braunschweiger is highly perishable, should be kept well refrigerated, 
   and eaten within a couple of days.

   <p>
   This flavorful sausage is very popular in Northern Germany. It is 
   similar to Braunschweiger Mettwurst, but smoked much longer so it is 
   quite firm and not spreadable. It is made of pork, or pork and beef, 
   and mustard seeds, then smoked and dried. The photo specimen was a 
   half link, 2.18 inches diameter and weighing 9 ounces. The whole link 
   would have been about 9 inches long. Made somewhere in

   <h3>J&auml;gdwurst</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_jagd05h.jpg" alt="Cut Jagdwurst" class=mrg>
   Literally "Hunting Sausage", this is a German cooked sausage made of 
   pork, beef, pork belly and water, variously spiced. Part of the meat 
   is very finely ground while part of it is left coarsely ground or in 
   chunks. Most makers use chunks smaller than shown in the photo. Fat 
   content for Jagdwurst is usually around 20%.
   <p>In East Germany, under the Soviets, this sausage was often 
   sliced, breaded, and fried&nbsp;  - &nbsp; then called "J&auml;gerschnitzel". This 
   is not to be confused with the real J&auml;gerschnitzel, which is a 
   veal schnitzel served with mushroom sauce.  The photo specimen, made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, was 2 inches diameter, 
   cut from a stick about 18 inches long.

   <p>
   A fully cooked sausage of German origin, usually stuffed into hog 
   casings, aged 2 to 5 days and lighly smoked. It can be prepared and 
   served by all methods used for wieners but cooking time must be longer 
   and temperatures lower to allow full penetration of heat. If boiled, 
   roasted or fried it will split open, justifying the name which means 
   "crack sausage". The photo specimens,  made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, were 4-3/4 inches long, 
   1-3/4 inches in diameter, weighed 5-1/2 ounces and cost 2015

   <br><img src="img/sg_landj02e.jpg" alt="Cut Landjaeger" class=mrg>
   <p>This sausage is a popular snack in Southern Germany, Austria, 
   Switzerland and Alsace. The name is apparently a distortion of the 
   words for "long smoked" into the word for gamekeeper or mounted 
   police. This sausage is traditionally half beef and half pork, though 
   horse meat is sometimes used in Austria. It is usually pressed into 
   a somewhat rectangular cross section.</p>
   <p>It can be kept unrefrigerated for some time so, is popular with 
   hunters and hikers, and was formerly carried by soldiers. The photo 
   specimen, made by <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, was 
   6 inches long by 1-3/8 wide and 5/8 inch thick, weighing 2.9 ounces.

   <p>
   A soft spreadable fully cooked sausage popular for sandwiches and 
   canap&eacute;s. Compared to Liverwurst it is firmer, smokier and 
   saltier. It got its name from often being served in sandwiches during 
   teatime. The most famous is R&uuml;genwalder Teewurst, a protected 
   designation available only to companies formerly headquartered in 
   R&uuml;genwald in Pomerania. After WWII all Germans were expelled 
   from Pomerania, which became part of Poland. This sausage is 
   traditionally made from 3 parts raw pork, 1 part bacon, and made up 
   into short chubs before being smoked over beechwood, then aged 7 to 
   10 days. The photo specimen, made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, was 4-1/2 inches long,

   <p>
   This sausage is made in Thuringia under EU PGI laws, so is not much 
   seen in North America. I publish it here because of possible confusion 
   with American <a href="sausage.html#summer">Summer Sausage</a> / Cervelat which 
   is sometimes called "Thuringer", but is quite different. The German 
   sausage, called Roster for short, is a fresh sausage to be grilled 
   or roasted and is made from chopped pork, beef (sometimes veal), salt 
   pepper, caraway seed, marjoram, and garlic. It is low in fat, about 
   25%, contrasting with up to 60% for other German sausages. At least 51% 
   of the ingredients must come from Thuringia.

   <br><img src="img/sg_weiss02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Weisswurst" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This is a sausage of Bavaira, traditionally made before dawn and 
   served before noon&nbsp;  - &nbsp; because before refrigeration it would have 
   spoiled before evening. In Bavaria it is still eaten mostly before 
   noon. It is usually made of veal and pork back bacon, distinctively 
   seasoned with various mixes of parsley, lemon, mace, onions, ginger, 
   and cardamom.</p>
   <p>Traditionally, this sausage is poached, not boiled, for about 
   10 minutes, then served in a bowl of the hot water it was cooked in, 
   along with a special sweet mustard (Wei&szlig;wurstsenf) and a soft 
   pretzel or the like. The least offensive way of eating it is to split 
   it lengthwise, then roll the meat off the skin with a fork. OK, you 
   wanted to know, so the more offensive way is to cut the ends open and 
   suck the meat out of the skin. This is mercifully impossible here. 
   Processed to FDA and USDA regulations they are a ittle too firm. The 
   photo specimens, made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s30">Schreiners Fine Sausages</a>, were 4-3/4 inches long by 
   1-1/8 diameter, weighing 2-3/4 ounces, cooked and vacuum packed on

   <p>
   The Germans blame this sausage on the Austrians (Wien = Vienna) and the 
   Austrians blame it on the Germans (Frankfurt). It is the prototype on 
   which the American Hot Dog is based. The weiner is thought to have been 
   created in the late 1600s by German butcher Johann Georghehner, living 
   in the town of Coburg, now in northern Bavaria, about 94 miles east of 
   Frankfurt.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens include a European Style Weiner (back) by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s07">European Meat Specialties</a>. It is not skinless, 5 
   inches long, 1.1 inches diameter, 2-1/2 ounces. Pork, water, nonfat 
   dry milk, salt, spices, sodium phosphate, sodium nitrite, sodium 
   erythorbate. To the right are Cocktail Wieners by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a>, Skinless, 2-3/4 inches long, 7/8 inch 
   diameter, 1 ounce each. Pork, water, salt, nonfat dry milk, sodium 
   phosphate, spices, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite. In the front 
   is a typical American <a href="sausage.html#hdog">Hot Dog</a> for comparison.</p>
   <p>The typical European Wiener is plumper, jucier, smoother in texture 
   and more gently seasoned than the typical American hot dog, with a lot 
   less salt, and usually some nutmeg. The European wieners are more prone 
   to splitting open than the hot dog when long simmered.

   <br><img src="img/sg_fuet02e.jpg" alt="Fuet Sausages" class=mrg>
   Some lump fuet as "chorizo" because it's Spanish (Catalunia region), but it's 
   really its own thing and doesn't have the intense paprika Spanish chorizos 
   have.This is a dry fermented sausage ready to slice and eat. Fuet means "whip", 
   and most is at least half again as long as the photo sample which is a short 
   version for the convenience of retail stores. The sample, from 
   <a href="sausage.html#s05">La Espa&ntilde;ola Meats</a>, was 8-1/4 inches long, 1-1/8 inch in

   <p>
   Longaniza and Lingui&ccedil;a (Pronounced ling-GWEE-sah), are very 
   similar, but both vary significantly from region to region.  Neither 
   is <u>at all similar</u> to sausages under the same names anywhere else 
   in the Spanish / Portuguese world. The version of Lingui&ccedil;a in 
   the photo is fully cooked and lightly smoked, made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s17">Silva</a> in California, who say they've been making 
   the same sausage for 35 years. It was 9-1/2 inches long, 1-1/4 inches 
   in diameter and weighed 6-1/2 ounces. Pork, wine, vinegar, non-fat dry 
   milk, salt, paprika, sugar, garlic, spices, monosodium glutamate,

   <br><img src="img/sg_morcilc03e.jpg" alt="Morcilla Sausage" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This sausage is important to the cuisines of Spain. It holds together 
   quite well when simmered so it can be used in soups and stews. The 
   photo specimens were  Morcilla de Cebolla (Morcilla with Onion), 5 
   inches long 1-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 4 ounces. Pork, 
   dehydrated onions, beef blood, salt, paprika, spices, garlic, sodium 
   erythorbate, sodium nitrite; 36% fat. These were from

     [Spain]
   <br><img src="img/sg_morcila02e.jpg" alt="Morcilla de Arroz Sausage" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This sausage is very common in Spanish kitchens. Like regular Morcilla 
   it is used in stews, but it swells and disintegrates rather than 
   staying whole. It can also be grilled and/or fried. They are more 
   perishable than Morcilla de Cebola, so they should be kept 
   refrigerated and used soon after purchase. The photo specimens were 
   5-1/4 inches long 1-1/8 inches diameter and weighed 4 ounces. Pork, 
   cooked rice, dehydrated onions, beef blood, salt, paprika, garlic, 
   spices, 7% fat.  These were from <a href="sausage.html#s05">La Espa&ntilde;ola

   end of the pig), cut into chunks, spiced, and coated with a mix of 
   spices and paprika (hot paprika for hot capicolla). It's then packed 
   in 3 to 4 inch casings and smoked until fully cooked. The photo 
   specimens were about 3-1/2 inch diameter.</p>
   <p>Capicolla is intensely flavorful so generally used sliced very thin 
   for sandwiches and the like. Typically it contains salt, coriander, 
   sugar, mace, phosphates, citric acid, pepper, juniper berries and

   This is a raw fermented salami aged in a temperature and humidity 
   controlled 
   environment where it accumulates a blue/white coating of natural mold. 
   It is normally just sliced and eaten, but it can be used as a pizza 
   topping or mixed into salads. This salami can be kept at a cool room 
   temperature, but if kept too long it will dry out and be impossible to 
   chew. The photo specimen, by <a href="sausage.html#s18">Gallo</a> (not the wine

   <h3>Italian Sausage</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh) &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Italy]
   <br><img src="img/sg_italian01e.jpg" alt="Whole Italian Sausages" class=mrg>
   <p>
   In the USA "Italian Sausage" means a fresh pork sausage seasoned with 
   fennel and other spices, properly made with a meat to fat ratio of 3 
   to 1. Similar sausages are actually made in Italy. Here it is 
   generally available in "Hot" and "Mild" versions but the hot are still 
   fairly mild. Some are made with extra fennel seeds and sold as Italian 
   Fennel Sausage.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens (mild on left, hot on right) were "store made" 
   by a local Italian market in Los Angeles (Glendale, actually). They 
   ranged from 5-1/2 to 6 inches long, 1.4 inches in diameter and between 
   4.2 and 4.8 ounces each.</p>
   <p><b>Buy</b> preferably "store made" from a reputable Italian market 
   - commercial brands are highly variable in quality. This sausage must 
   be cooked before eating and may be cooked whole (pierce the casings 
   in a few places so they don't explode), or stripped of their casings 
   and crumbled, depending on use. They can be sliced before cooking if 
   nearly frozen. These sausages are perishable so keep well refrigerated 
   and use within a few days. They can be frozen for up to 3 months.

   <h3>Mortadella</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Air Cured)
   <br><img src="img/sg_morta04e.jpg" alt="Mortadella Slices" class=mrg>
   Real Italian Mortadella was illegal in the United States for 30 years, 
   the ban finally lifted in 2000. In the mean time, an imitation was 
   manufactured in North America. In Italy mortadella is air dried but in 
   the U.S. both imported and domestic "mortadella" had to go through 
   additional cooking steps making them basically just 
   <a href="sausage.html#bolog">Bologna</a> with little lumps of pork fat and extra 
   garlic. While the real thing is now legal, the imitation will remain 
   dominant here due to price difference&nbsp;  - &nbsp; and because that's what people 
   are used to.
   <p>A version of mortadella with embedded pistachio nuts was developed in 
   Germany, and American manufacturers followed suit. The photo specimen is 
   Colombia brand with and without pistachios, 5 inches in diameter, sliced 
   for sandwiches.<br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Parma Salami</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Dry Cured - 90 days)

   by Ferrarini (and some others) it is mild, and softer and less salty than 
   many dry cured salames. The photo example was 5-1/2 inches long, 2.12 
   inches diameter, and weighed 10 ounces. Pork, sea salt, red wine, sugar, 
   pepper, garlic sodium ascorbate, lactic acid starter culture, sodium 
   nitrite, potassium nitrate, mace. A multi-ethnic market here in 
   Los Angeles (Sunland) had a pile of them for 2022 US $2.99 each, but 
   on the Web, expect about  $12.99 plus shipping.

   in Los Angeles, was labeled "Cervelat" and subtitled "Russian Brand 
   Smoked Sausage". This type is made in some regions of Europe and is 
   very similar to an American Summer Sausage, but "Cervelat" is much 
   different in Switzerland and nearby regions of France and Germany. 
   The photo specimen was 13-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches in diameter 
   and weighed 1.2 pounds. Pork, salt, spices, sugar, sodium erythorbate, 
   sodium nitrite. These sausages must be kept refrigerated and should 
   be eaten within a week of cutting the casing.

   <br><img src="img/sg_doctor03h.jpg" alt="cut Doctorskaya" class=mrg>
   <p>
   A Russian version of Bologna. It is called "Doctor's" and "Baby" from 
   its very smooth soft texture (thought suitable for invalids and 
   babies). It is made in various sizes and may be made from pork or 
   veal. Specialty sausage makers often double label it, "Balogna" in 
   Roman letters and "Doctorskaya" in Cyrillic. The photo sample, made by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a>, was 2 inches in diameter, made from pork, 
   and was distinctly spiced with nutmeg. Eureka also makes it in 3 inch 
   diameter.

   <p>
   This name translates to "Moscow Special" (not to be confused with 
   Moskovskaya Osobaya brand vodka). It's a cooked smoked salami similar 
   to the regular Moskovskaya but all pork instead of pork and beef and 
   significantly stiffer and drier. It needs to be refrigerated and eaten 
   within a week of opening. Typically: pork, salt, spices, sodium 
   erythorbate, sodium nitrite. The photo sample, 14 inches long, 1-3/4

   Literally "Ham Chopped" this Russian sausage consists of ham chopped 
   into largish pieces, mixed with some seasonings and preservatives, 
   and stuffed into a casing. Very ham-like in flavor. The example shown 
   would be about 14" long whole, and 2-1/4" in diameter. You can use

   <p>
   Why this sausage should be named after an obscure whistle stop on the 
   Trans Siberian Railway is beyond me, but it is a very good hard salami. 
   Diameter 1-3/4 inches, Pork, beef, ham 50 extra (modified cornstarch, 
   diphosphates, triphosphates, carrageenan, maltodxtrin, yeast extracts, 
   sodium L-ascorbate), sodium nitrite, paprika. Made by

   <p>
   A fully cooked and smoked Russian sausage similar to the 
   <a href="sausage.html#moskov">Moskovskaya</a> but a bit closer to a dry salami in 
   flavor. The photo sample, by <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a>, was 9-1/2 
   inches long, 2 inches in diameter and weighed 1 pound 2-1/2 ounces. 
   Typically: pork, beef, sodium lactate, salt, sodium phosphate, sugar,

   <h3>Sardelka</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked)
   <br><img src="img/sg_sardelk02e.jpg" alt="Sardelka Sausages" class=mrg>
   This "large sausage" is a Russian version of Bockwurst and is also 
   popular in Armenia. If simmered too long it splits very severely, so 
   it's usually timed to pull from the pot just before it splits. A 
   sausage fresh from the fridge, dropped into boiling water, was 
   floating by 7 minutes, indicating it was pretty much heated through. 
   It split at 12 minutes.
   <p>The photo specimes were typically 6 inches long, 1-3/8 inches 
   diameter and weighed 4-1/4 ounces each. These were purchased from the 
   service deli of a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles for 2015 US 
   $2.99 / pound (sale price). Typically made from beef, pork, chicken, 
   pork fat and spices, in natural casings. The photo specimens, from 
   Illinois, were made with pork and turkey.

   This sausage is traditionally part of the Christmas celebration in

   in areas of North America with significant Swedish communities often 
   make it up around Christmas time. Ingredients usually include  
   pork, beef, onion, potato and black and white pepper. Another form 
   of Potatiskorv is made in Smaland without beef.  The photo

   <br><img src="img/sg_lyoner03e.jpg" alt="Slices of Lyoner Bologna" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This sausage, made from pork and beef, or pork and veal, is named for 
   Lyon, France, but is usually associated with Switzerland. While often 
   called "Lyoner Bologna", it is rather different in flavor from 
   American or Italian Bologna. In Germany it is the most popular 
   sausage for use in Wurstsalat.</p>
   <p>Traditionally, it was made with little or no garlic, but versions 
   are now made with more garlic, often called "Garlic Lyoner". 
   Traditionally, it was a white color, because it was made without 
   nitrite, but safety from botulism has won out. The photo specimen, 
   3 inches in diameter, was made in California by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s31">Mama Viki's Food</a>. 2015 US $3.99 / pound; Pork,

   <br><img src="img/sg_cervelf01e.jpg" alt="Roasted Swiss Cervelat" class=mrg>
   <p>
   This sausage isn't much seen in Southern California, but I publish it 
   here due to possible confusion with Cervelats made in North America, 
   Russia and other parts of Europe, which are very different. This type 
   is made in Switzerland, where it is considered the national sausage. 
   It is also made in adjacent Alsace and Lyon, France, and some adjacent 
   parts of Germany. The photo shows a sausage cut in the traditional 
   Swiss manner. It is made from very finely ground beef, pork, bacon, 
   pork rind, and ice, seasoned with spices. The texture is similar to 
   a European wiener and the flavor is also similar but smokier. The 
   name implies the sausage contains brains, but it hasn't included 
   those since the late 19th century.

   <h3>Basturma</h3> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; (Fully Dry Cured)
   <br><img src="img/sg_bast02e.jpg" alt="Cut Basturma" class=mrg>
   Pronounced "bah-stourm-AH", this is the Armenian version of a family 
   of dry cured meats to which Prosciutto and Pastrami belong. Sections 
   of beef loin are first buried in salt for 2-3 days, then washed, dried 
   and pressed under weights, then dried again. they are finally soaked 
   for 2 weeks or so in a paste called <i>Chaman</i> made of salt, 
   fenugreek, garlic (lots of garlic), paprika, chilis, and other spices, 
   then packaged coated with this mixture. Clearly this is powerful 
   stuff! The photo specimen, by <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a>, was 6 inches 
   by 4-3/4 inches by 1-5/8 inches and weighed about a pound. The fine 
   print says, "Raw beef, cook before eating", but this is widely ignored 
   - it's just sliced very thin and eaten as is. It is used in recipes 
   though, for instance it can be used in place of Soujuk in 
   <a href="../recipes/tbm_eggsouj1.html">Eggs &amp; Soujuk Sausage</a>
   <p></p>
   <p>Note that the word "basturma" (variously spelled) is widespread 
   through the Caucasus, Turkey and the Balkans but doesn't mean the same 
   thing everywhere. While in the U.S. and Armenia, basturma is made of 
   beef as described here, elsewhere it may be made of lamb and in some 
   places pork. In some regions the word represents a recipe for 
   marinated lamb or beef grilled on skewers, not sausage-like at all.

   <br><img src="img/sg_souj02h.jpg" alt="Cut Soujuk Sausages" class=mrg>
   <p>
   A fermented dried beef sausage. It is said to derive from the pressed 
   dried and salted meat Turkic horsemen kept under their saddles to eat 
   while invading countries and slaughtering their peoples. This sausage 
   is widely available in Los Angeles due to its huge Armenian community 
   (Armenians joke that their country has two capitals, Yerevan and 
   Glendale). Armenians and Turks hate each other but share a common 
   cuisine.</p>
   <p>Shown are typical examples, traditionally flattened from 
   <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a> and round from <a href="sausage.html#s03">Ohanyan's</a>. 
   The round was 6 inches by 1-1/2 inch diameter, the flat was 8-1/2 
   inches by 1-1/2 inches by 0.8 inches but larger sizes are available. 
   Spicing is typically garlic, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and 
   dried chili. A starter culture is used for fermentation. In Turkey 
   "tail fat" is added but fat tail sheep aren't raised here. I notice 
   Eureka uses "natural pork casings" clearly targeting Armenian and 
   Georgian Christians while excluding Muslims, but Ohanyan's is sold 
   in Turkish markets so must use sheep, veal or collagen casings.

   This sausage was labeled "Erevanskaya", which is Russian for "from

   any Armenian sausages other than <a href="sausage.html#souj">Soujuk</a>, which 
   this clearly isn't. <a href="sausage.html#s02">Eureka</a> subtitles it "Armenian 
   smoked dry hot salami", and as a major maker of soujuk they certainly 
   should know the difference, but I have no idea what this sausage might 
   be called in Armenia. It's a fermented sausage (like soujuk) and much 
   dryer and spicier than Eureka's various Russian sausages, though I 
   certainly wouldn't call it "hot" by Southern California standards. 
   The photo specimen was 14-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches in diameter, 
   and weighed 1.2 pounds. Pork, salt, dextrose, garlic, black pepper, 
   coriander, hot red pepper, starter culture, sodium erythorbate,

   and/or juicy. I do not fault this manufacturer, who's product is as 
   good as any I've tried, but point to the impossibility of imitating 
   the complex flavors and textures of meats. Personally, I don't get the 
   point&nbsp;  - &nbsp; with tens of thousands of great vegetarian recipes in the world 
   why bother with imitations of meat products that can't be imitated?

   <h3>Lamb Sausage, Moroccan</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fresh)
   <br><img src="img/sg_lambm01e.jpg" alt="Moroccan Lamb Sausage" class=mrg>
   <p>
   The photo specimens, obtained fresh from a Whole Foods Market, were 7 
   inches long, 1 inch in diameter and weighed 3 ounces. Lamb, spices 
   (black pepper, cumin, coriander), sea salt, citric acid, natural lemon 
   flavor, canola oil, and natural lamb casings. This formulation is 
   fine for the flavor of North African recipes, but doesn't assure 
   kosher / halal if the animals have not been slaughtered and prepared 
   in accordance with religious laws  - plenty good enough for Christians 
   and Pagans though.</p>
   <p>This is a rather spicy sausage, though the "hot" aspect comes from 
   black pepper rather than chilis. The cumin and coriander are fairly 
   assertive as well. In cooking it exudes quite a bit of both oil and 
   water, so for browning you want to use a fairly high heat (and there 
   will be a lot of splattering). Grilling over hot coals will get better 
   browning than frying, but frying works fine too. The overall effect 
   is significantly drier than a pork sausage but moist enough to be 
   enjoyable, and of course the flavor is different.

   <br><img src="img/sg_boer02e.jpg" alt="Coiled Boerewors Sausage" class=mrg>
   Not to be confused with Boer Wars, this is the favorite sausage of 
   South Africa, originally created by Dutch settlers, the Boers. It is 
   made from beef, but may also contain pork and/or lamb, and is in the 
   form of a coil. Spicing typically includes coriander seed, black 
   pepper, nutmeg, cloves and allspice. Preparation is usually to grill 
   a whole coil. It is often eaten made into "boerie rolls", in a split 
   roll similar to an American hot dog. The photo specimen is an all 
   beef version made in California by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s24">Harmony Farms</a>, 1-1/4 inches diameter. It is dark 
   in color because it doesn't include the nitrites or nitrates, usually 
   included in commercial sausages, so it is sold frozen. Ingred: Beef 
   chuck meat, salt, spices, MSG, sodium metabisulphite, citric acid, 
   sodium erythorbate, hog casing.

   These small dry beef sausages are very distinctively spiced. They 
   may have originated in Lebanon, but probably introduced by Armenian 
   refugees. In North America they are provided by Armenian and Georgian 
   sausage makers. Typically they are 0.80 inch 
   diameter and 2.75 inches long. The photo specimens were by 
   <a href="sausage.html#s38">Yerevan Premium Foods</a>, purchased from a large 
   multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $12.99 / 
   pound. Beef, salt, spices, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, pine nuts, 
   lemon juice, sugar, sodium nitrite, sodium phosphate, red food 
   coloring, fresh lamb casing.

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Hardly anyone considers sausages to be health food, but they sure 
taste good, and many people have survived eating them. Here in California, 
the untimely death of George Johnson was recently noted (2006) in the 
newspapers. There is little doubt an unvarying diet of sausages and 
waffles contributed to his demise at age 112, but that's a risk some of 
us are willing to take.</p>

<h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; By nature, sausages are high in 
salt, because salt is one of the important preservatives that keeps them 
from spoiling. Sausages that can be kept at room temperature for some time 
will be the saltiest. Despite the shrieking of the do-gooders, the 
question of the danger level for salt is still wide open. Most people 
seem able to regulate salt quite efficiently.<p></p>

<h3>Fat:</h3> &nbsp; Sausages are high in fat. Fat acts as a 
preservative and as a conveyance for most of the sausage's flavor. Because 
they are made from animal products, sausages will be high in saturated 
fats. The American Heart Association says saturated fats will kill you in 
short order, but people who have adhered to the Atkins diet (very high in 
saturated fats) have had no such problems. The worst artery clogger has 
proven to be the trans fats the AHA had been trying to get us to eat 
instead, for the past 50 years or so. The polyunsaturated fats they still 
promote may not be much safer. Recent research shows that saturated fats 
protect rat hearts from the ravages of canola oil. Of course fats can 
make you fat, and obesity is a problem in North America, so apply 
moderation. A fat being saturated doesn't seem to make that much 
difference (except it's more resistant to rancidity and formation 
of carcinogens).<p></p>

<h3>Nitrites</h3> &nbsp; Sodium Nitrate and Sodium Nitrite 
are very important to maintaining color in cured meat products like 
sausages (during cure nitrates convert to nitrites) and also, in 
combination with Sodium Chloride (salt) they are powerful inhibitors 
of harmful bacteria. Despite the suspected possibility of danger to 
humans, the FDA has not banned nitrites - because the alternative 
(botulism) is considered a much greater danger, resulting in an 
immediate and <i>very</i> uncomfortable death.<p></p>

<p>Nitrites have been shown to combine with amines in meat in the acid 
environment of the stomach to form nitrosamines, which are thought to be 
at least somewhat carcinogenic. The actual risk is entirely unknown at 
this time, but it is known that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can greatly 
reduce nitrosamine formation, so you will find sausages that contain 
nitrite will also contain ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate or sodium 
erythorbate to suppress nitrosamine formation.</p>

<p>It is known that many people who have eaten large amounts of sausages 
and bacon and drunk plenty of beer for most of their lives have lived to 
a ripe old age. Today's sausages, bacon and beer are far safer 
(nitrosamine wise) than what elderly people would have consumed for most 
of their lives. There have been a significant number of reported cases 
of nitrite poisoning, mostly in children, but these nitrites were all 
from vegetables, some of which are naturally very high in nitrites. 
They were not from sausages.</p>
