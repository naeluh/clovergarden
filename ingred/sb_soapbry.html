<h1>Soapberry</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>
Soapberries (<i>Sapindaceae</i>) are a diverse family of 
temperate to subtropical trees, shrubs and lianas (vines), a few of which 
have some significance as food - and others as cleansing agents.

<h2 id="maple">Maple</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_maplesyrp01k.jpg" alt="Bowl fo Maple Syrup" class=mrg>
[<i>Acer</i>]
<p>
This temperate climate hardwood tree is noted for hardwood lumber used 
to make bowling pins and such, and it's leaves provide something for Canadians 
to put on their flag. One maple variety is, however, of culinary interest, 
providing a sap that can be boiled down to make a sweetener called "maple syrup" 
for use on breakfast pancakes. This sap is produced mainly in Vermont and 
Canada, both of which claim theirs is better than the other. The production 
season generally lasts for 6 weeks in the Spring.</p>
<p>Maple Syrup grades are established by the USDA. Canada adheres to similar 
grading but uses different names. These are not quality grades (there 
are no cheap Chinese sugar maples so we presume all the trees are of the 
highest quality). These are usage grades, and the makers have little control 
as to what grades they'll get in any particular year, that's pretty much up 
to the trees.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grade A Light Amber</b> is the lightest grade and has the mildest 
maple flavor. It's usually made early in the season when the weather is 
colder. This grade is preferred for making maple cream and maple candy.</li>
<li><b>Grade A Medium Amber</b> is somewhat darker, and the maple flavor is 
a little more intense. This is the most popular table syrup grade. It usually 
is made about mid-season when the weather warms a bit.</li>
<li><b>Grade A Dark Amber</b> is the darkest grade commonly used as table 
syrup and is normally made late in the season.</li>
<li><b>Grade B</b> is often called Cooking Syrup and is made late in the 
season. It is very dark with a strong maple flavor, but some prefer it as 
table syrup for just that reason. Most use it for baking, and flavoring 
foods.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Lychee</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_lychee04h.jpg" alt="Fresh Lychee Fruit" class=mrg> 
[<i>Litchi chinensis</i>]
<p>
Native to Southern China and Southeast Asia, these fruits are about 1-1/2" 
inch diameter. They have a thin leathery shell that's dark yellow and reddish 
in color (but it turns brown if refrigerated). Very loosely contained within 
the shell is a translucent white flesh, similar in texture to the inside of a 
grape, and one bullet shaped seed (which is mildly toxic so don't eat it).</p> 
<p>Lychees are commonly sold fresh in Asia, California and other regions with 
large Asian enclaves. Canned Lychees are widely available. Some are grown in 
Hawaii and Florida.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Longan</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_longan01e.jpg" alt="Longan Fruit" class=mrg>
[longy, long-nan (China); <i>Nephelium longanum</i>]
<p>
Native to South and Southeast Asia, this spherical fruit has a thin leathery 
brown shell which loosely contains a soft juicy translucent flesh with one 
spherical black seed. The flesh is used in Asia in soups, sweets and 
sweet-and-sour recipes, but the seed is not eaten. They are available frozen 
and occasionally fresh in Asian markets here in Los Angeles. They are also 
widely available peeled and canned.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="akee">Akee</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_akee01h.jpg" alt="Whole Opened Akee Fruit" class=mrg>
[Ackee, Achee, Zakari el Trufi, Y Chocorras el Albatros; Akye fufo 
(Africa); <i>Blighia sapida</i>]
<p>
Native to tropical West Africa, this pear shaped fruit was transported to 
the Caribbean on slave ships sometime before 1778, and has been extensively 
planted there. Weighing between 4 and 7 ounces, the fruit is mostly toxic, 
including the flesh. Only the white or light yellow arils (fleshy coatings 
around the seeds) are non-toxic, and only when the fruit is ripe and has 
opened naturally. If overripe it will again be  toxic.</p>
<p>"Salt Cod and Akee" is considered the Jamaican national dish. 
Akee is used in other Caribbean cuisines as well. Improperly prepared Akee 
is the cause of Jamaican vomiting sickness. The very nutritious arils are 
washed and simmered for 30 minutes before use, the water discarded. The 
photo shows a fruit at the proper point to be harvested.

<h2>Mamoncillo</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_mamon02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Mamones Fruits" class=mrg>
[Spanish Lime;  Mmmones, Quenepa, Genip, Chenet, Canepa, Skinip, 
Kinnip; Anancillo (Cuba);  Ackee (St Vincent, Grenadines, Barbados); 
<i>Melicoccus bijugatus</i>]
<p>
Native to northern South America, this fruit was introduced into Central 
America, Mexico and the Caribbean in pre-Columbian times, and into Africa, 
India and tropical Asia since then. It has a hard but thin green outer 
skin surrounding a tart yellow pulp. It is generally eaten fresh by 
cracking the shell and sucking the pulp off the single large seed. This 
is not real easy, as the pulp is thin and adheres well to the seed. The 
taste is lightly sweet-sour with an apricot like flavor. There are 
varieties which are more sour, and eaten in southern Mexico with chili, 
salt and lime. The seeds can be roasted and eaten. The photo specimens 
were about 7/8 inch diameter, 1 inch long and weighed 0.25 ounce each. 
They were bought from a large Hispanic market in Los Angeles (Burbank) 
for 2016 US $2.99 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Rambutan</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_rambu11h.jpg" alt="Whole, cut Rambutan Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Nephelium lappaceum</i>]
<p>
This red, pink or yellow fruit, about the size of a small chicken egg, is 
significant in Southeast Asia but production is ramping up in other tropical 
areas including Hawaii. Starting in 2008 fresh fruit have been allowed 
into the U.S. while previous they had to be frozen.</p>
<p>Rambutan's single seed is surrounded by a firm but juicy sweet pulp, 
much like a Lychee and of similar flavor and texture. They are also 
frozen, made into  preserves and canned for shipment to non-tropical 
regions. The photo specimens were up to 2-1/4 long by 1-3/4 diameter 
weighing 1.4 ounces. A 1.25 ounce Rambutan will yield about 0.63 ounce 
of edible flesh (50%). Yield is about 40% from frozen. The seeds are 
bitter and slightly toxic so should be discarded.  A recent purchase 
at a very large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) was at 
2016 US $1.59 per pound, much lower than a couple years ago.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pitomba</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_pitomb01e.jpg" alt="Bundle of Fruits" class=mrg>
[Cotopalo (Spanish); Olho de boi, Pitomba-rana, Pitomba de Macaco 
(Portuguese); Pitoulier Comestible (French); <i>Talisia esculenta</i>]
<p>
Native to the Amazon Basin, this medium size tree produces spherical fruits 
between 5/8 and 1-5/8 inches diameter. The thin brown skin covers a golden 
yellow pulp with an apricot-like texture. It is juicy, aromatic, slightly 
tart and faintly resinous - described as a combination of apricot and lemon. 
It is eaten fresh, and used to make juice. Seeds are roasted to treat 
diarrhea and sap from the tree is used to poison fish. This pitomba should 
not be confused with a myrtle fruit also called 
<a href="myrtle.html#pitom">Pitomba</a>.

<h2>Guarana</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_guaran02h.jpg" alt="Drawing of Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Paullinia cupana</i>]
<p>
Native to the Amazon Basin, this climbing plant produces fruits about the 
size of coffee beans, but with twice as much caffeine in the seeds. As you 
might expect, it is used mainly as a stimulant in beverages, and has been 
for hundreds of years. South America gets most of its caffeine from guarana, 
not coffee.</p>
<p>Uses include carbonated soft drinks, energy shots, teas, and capsules. 
It is also being studied as a weight loss agent, with positive results. 
For this use it is mixed with other substances suspected of aiding weight 
loss. In the USA it is not listed as Generally Regarded as Safe as a food, 
but is approved as a food additive for flavor, not non-flavor usages.

<h2>Aritha</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_aritha03e.jpg" alt="Nuts, whole and broken" class=mrg>
[Soapnut; Doda, Kanma, Thali (India);  <i>Sapindus mukorossi</i>]
<p>
These nuts, long used in India and ingrained in the Ayurvedic lifestyle, 
are gaining attention from North Americans seeking to reduce the number 
of chemicals and artificial ingredients in their lives. They are used 
both for laundering clothes and as a shampoo. Because this shampoo is 
a mild insecticide it has been used for removing head lice.</p>
<p>Broken shells (discarding the hard seed) are tossed in with the 
laundry, or powdered forms are used. The photo specimens, purchased from 
an Indian market in Los Angeles, were about 7/8 inches diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Horse Chestnut</h2>
<br><img src="img/sb_horsecn01h.jpg" alt="Pile of Nuts" class=mrg>
[Conkers, <i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>]
<p>
Native to the Balkan region of Europe, horse chestnuts are somewhat toxic, to 
people and horses. Their main culinary use is is Bavaria, where they were 
planted in beer gardens for their very dense shade to keep ice from melting. 
Today they provide shade for the customers.</p>
<p>During both world wars they were used to produce acetone, which was in 
turn used to produce cordite explosives. They have also been used to make 
soap for washing linen (they are "soapberries", after all).
