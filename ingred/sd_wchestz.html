<p>
Water Chestnuts are native to China, Japan, India and Southeast Asia, 
the Philippines, Australia, Pacific Islands and tropical Africa. They 
are extensively farmed in Southern China and the Philippines, 
where they grow well in flooded rice paddies and lotus ponds.</p>
<p>Mature plants produce the underground "corms" we call Water Chestnuts 
as a means of propagation. Their crunchy texture and slight sweetness 
are appreciated in soups and stir fries. A notable feature is that they 
remain crisp and crunchy even after cooking or canning, making them 
a good texture accent.</p>

<p>Canned Water Chestnuts are very convenient, but the difference in taste 
between fresh and canned is amazing. For recipes where Water Chestnuts are 
a significant feature, you want fresh if at all possible.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Water Chestnuts are available from many 
Asian markets, and occasionally in upscale supermarkets and yuppie outlets. 
Reject any that show mold. The photo specimens were purchased from a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US $1.99 / pound. Canned 
Water Chestnuts are available in the "Chinese" section of most supermarkets, 
whole and sliced. Flavor is marginally better with the whole ones.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Water Chestnuts should be rinsed well, 
drained well, and refrigerated. Packed loosely in plastic, they will 
keep for a week or so. Discard if they get moldy.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; For fresh Water Chestnuts, use a sharp vegetable 
slicing knife to take a thin slice off the top and bottom. Then 
peel around the rest. I find a razor sharp slicing knife is easier to 
use and does a better job than a vegetable peeler, which often snags 
and breaks the Chestnut. You will notice each corm has a "belly button" 
off to one side, where it was attached to the parent plant. If deep, 
it is easily gouged out.<p></p>

<h2>Water Chestnut Starch:</h2>
<br><img src="img/sd_wcstch02k.jpg" alt="Dish of Water Chestnut Starch" class=mrg>
<p>Water Chestnuts contain a lot of starch, 60% 
by dry weight. This starch makes a particularly crisp coating for fried 
foods, much liked in Southeast Asia. It is also used as a thickener, 
and in China, is used to make some types of cakes and dumplings.</p>

<p>As a thickener, it is used particularly in clear soups, especially 
expensive Shark Fin Soup, because it is considerably more clear than 
Cornstarch. It is extremely neutral in flavor. It does have a slightly 
brown tint, but that wouldn't be noticed in a soup. It also has about 200% 
the thickening power of cornstarch and is very stable with boiling compared 
to most starches.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This starch is found in Asian markets and on-line. 
The package should specifically say "Starch" and there should be Chinese 
lettering, otherwise, you might be getting Flour.

<h2>Water Chestnut Flour</h2>
<br><img src="img/sd_wcflour02k.jpg" alt="Dish of Water Chestnut Flour" class=mrg>
<p>[Singoda Flour (India); Farine de Macre Commune (French)]</p>
<p>This is a specialty of India, used by Hindu adherents worldwide during 
periods of fasting. During these times it replaces Besan (Chickpea Flour) 
which is much used in India but forbidden during fasting.</p>
<p>Water Chestnut Flour has a light brown color, has far less thickening 
power than cornstarch, and would never be clear in a soup. It is used mainly 
in baked goods and as a coating for fried foods. This product is important 
to Indian communities, so can be easily found in Indian markets and on-line.

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2>

<p>Water Chestnuts are about 90% dry weight carbohydrates, 60% of dry weight 
is starch. They are also significant sources of dietary fiber, riboflavin, 
vitamin B6, potassium, copper, and manganese.</p>

<p>In India and other parts of Asia where pigs are raised near where 
water chestnuts grow, eating them (or other aquatic plants) raw can 
convey the parasitic trematode worm <i>Fasciolopsis buski</i>. This is 
not a problem with canned water chestnuts, which are lightly cooked, 
or fresh ones sold in North America which are from commercial ponds, 
not from peasant farms.</p>
