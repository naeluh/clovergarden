<h1>Barnacles</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Barnacles are crustaceans of family <i>Balanidae</i>, related (but not too 
closely) to shrimp. This bane of ships and boats saps power and speed when 
rough barnacles take up residence on the hull - and they're very difficult 
to remove. Copper sheathing and toxic paint are used to fend them off. 
Unfortunately, as is so often the case in nature, the most troublesome 
species are the least edible.	 &nbsp;

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>


<p>Barnacles first appear in the Middle Cambrian about 500 million years 
ago but had not yet developed the hard calcareous outer shell we see today.
They are Crustaceans, thus related to shrimp (but not too closely) with 
which they share the basic crustacean anatomy.</p>
<p>Larval barnacles float around until they find a suitable substrate. 
Then they latch on to it with their first antennae and glue their head 
down to it. From then on they're pretty much stuck there. A thin layer 
of flesh (mantle) forms from the head and wraps around the entire body 
and secretes an outer shell. With Goose Barnacles, the head extends to 
form a tough flexible stalk (the edible part).</p>
<p>The barnacle then feeds by using its feathery feet to capture small 
edible bits and critters that float by. Unlike mollusks barnacles don't 
pump water but depend on water circulation in exposed areas.</p>
<p>In Medieval times, since no-one had ever seen a goose nest or egg 
(they nest in the Arctic), it was thought the goose barnacle was the 
larval stage of the barnacle goose (<i>Branta leucopsis</i>). The 
barnacle goose was thus classified as a fish and allowed by the church 
to be eaten on Meatless Fridays.</p>

<p>[Gooseneck Barnacle, Percebes (Spain, Portugal); <i>Pollicipes 
polymerus</i> and similar species]
</p><p>
This is the Goose Barnacle of commerce and the plate. They attach to rocks 
in the intertidal zone with their feathery feet facing away from the waves. 
They catch food going by in the outflow.</p>
<p>Because they prefer rugged rocky environments with big waves they are 
dangerous to gather. They are gathered along the Iberian Peninsula (most 
are eaten in Spain and Portugal) and along the Pacific Northwest of the 
U.S. and Canada. Gathering them is tightly controlled in the Pacific 
Northwest and licenses are required for posession.

<p>[<i>Lepas anatifera</i> and similar species]
</p><p>
These Goose Barnacles attach to floating stuff on the high seas and depend 
on wave action to bring food to them. They're seen only when something 
they're attached to washes up on the shore. In an environment much less 
harsh than for intertidal species their stems are thinner. For these 
reasons they aren't much eaten.

<h2>Giant Barnacle</h2>

[Picoroco (Spanish): <i>Austromegabalanus psittacus</i> of family 
<i>Balanidae</i>]
<p>
These Barnacles are found off the coasts of Peru, Chili, and the southern 2/3 
of Argentina. Their outer shell can be up to 12 inches (30cm) tall. They are 
considered a prestigious (and expensive) seafood in Chile, and have been 
overharvested. Aquaculture is now being explored.

<h2>Acorn Barnacle</h2>
<br><a href="sf_bnachz.html">
<img src="img/sf_bnach01h.jpg" alt="Closed Barnacles" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Balanus amphitrite</i> and similar species]
<p>
The Acorn Barnacle is the most common and troublesome family of barnacles. 
It cements its head directly to the substrate without any stem at all.</p>
<p>This is not an edible family. Most acorn barnacles are around 1/2 inch 
across or smaller but even the giant barnacles of Antarctica (which may be 
over 3 inches across) have nothing to eat inside.

<h2 id="med" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Barnacles are not a significant food resource so little nutritional 
data has been published. Presumably they would be similar to shrimp. 
The main health risk for edible barnacles is in harvesting them.</p>
