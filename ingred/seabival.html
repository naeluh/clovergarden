<h1>Clams, Oysters, Mussels <small>&amp;</small> Scallops</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Bivalves are a class of mollusks that first appeared in the late 
Cambrian about 400 million years ago. They posses two shells which hinge 
at one edge and can be closed tightly when threatened or out of the water. 
They are filter feeders, gaining nourishment by filtering tiny organisms 
and digestible debris from the water. Some are sedentary, attaching 
themselves to a substrate (oysters, mussels), some burrow and move 
around on the bottom (clams) and a few can swim (scallops).

<h2>Ark Clams / Blood Clams</h2>
<p>[Ark Shell; family <i>Arcidae</i>] &nbsp; 
Found worldwide, Ark Clams are generally small, mostly 1 to 2 inches, 
but a few get tp 5 inches. Among the Ark Clams are the only shellfish 
that have red blood pigments (hemoglobin and myoglobin). This gives 
them better oxygen transfer allowing them to live in murky low oxygen 
environments in which most predators cannot thrive.</p>

[genus <i>Corbicula</i> of family <i>Cyrenidae</i>]
<p>
The freshwater clam <i>Corbicula leana</i> is used in miso soups in Japan 
under the name <i>mashijimi</i> (true shijimi), and in clam soups in 
Korea under the name <i>chamjaecheop</i> (true jaecheop). 
<i>C. fluminea</i> and <i>C. japonica</i> are similarly used but as 
just <i>shijimi</i> and <i>jaecheop</i>. These clams live in both fresh 
and brackish waters in Asia, but <i>C. fluminea</i> has become an 
invasive pest in North America, probably brought by Asians for use as 
food. The photo specimens, purchased frozen from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) averaged 7/8 inch long, but 
<i>C. fluminea</i> can grow to 2 inches long (measured on the longest 
direction).

  King Clam (U.S. marketing), Goiduck, Gweduck; <i>Panopea generosa</i> of 
  family <i>Hiatellidae</i>]
  <p>
The Geoduck (pronounce "gooy-duk") is the largest burrowing clam in 
the world. Individuals weighing 15 pounds are recorded and bigger ones 
rumored, but the photo specimen is a normal market size of 2.2 pounds. 
The shell was 6 inches long and 3-1/2 inches wide. Total length was 11 
inches, but that's meaningless since it could stretch out much longer. 
They are long lived with a record age of 168 years.</p>
<p>This clam is found only on the West Coast of North America from 
Washington State north through southern Alaska and from the tidal zone 
to 350 feet deep. The name comes from the Nisqually Indian "gwe-duk" 
("dig-deep") and the strange spelling is thought to have been a 
transcription error.

[Quahogs - Chowder Clams, Cherrystones, Topnecks, Littlenecks, 
Countnecks; <i>Mercenaria mercenaria</i> of family <i>Veneridae</i>]
<p>
This common North Atlantic is found on the coast of North America from 
Prince Edward Island, Canada all they way down to the Yucat&aacute;n 
Peninsula, Mexico but production is centered along the coast of the state 
of Rhode Island in New England, USA. Some are now farmed on the US and 
Mexican Pacific coast, England and northern Europe.</p>
<p>While any size can be called a "quahog" that designation is usually 
reserved for the largest sizes. The names given above from Chowder Clams 
to Countnecks are size designations in descending order. The photo 
specimens are Cherrystones from Mexico and were up to 3.4 inches the 
long way by 2.7 inches and 1.8 inches thick. 3 pounds yielded just over 
6 ounces of meat (12.6%) so at US $2.99/# the meat was $23.73 per pound. 
The meat is fairly chewy so these are best chopped up. &nbsp;

These clams were accidentally introduced in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. 
and Canada when Pacific Oysters were brought from Japan. They quickly became 
an invasive species but are now so popular a harvest both commercially and 
recreationally that the fishery is highly regulated.</p>
<p>These clams are also an aquaculture crop and are harvested at various 
sizes from 1-1/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches. The main problem with this crop is 
slow growth, taking over 3 years to reach harvest size. The photo 
specimens were typically 1.9 inches the long way by 1.4 inches and 0.8 
inch thick - 28 clams to the pound. &nbsp;

<p>
Native to estuaries of Japan and Korea, These clams were brought 
to Victoria Island, Canada around 1988, probably in ship's balast 
water. They have spread north from there, and south along the northern 
coast of Washington State. A similar introduction now infests most of 
the coastal estuaries of the state of Oregon. They grow to about 2.75 
inches measured the long way, but the largest of the photo specimens was 
2.0 inches, weighing 0.88 ounce (25 gm). They are not currently farmed, 
but are harvested from high in the intertidal zone (above the Manilla 
Clam zone), where there can be more than 1400 clams per square yard.

This clam has recently been available live at a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel). So far, I haven't found them mentioned 
anywhere except on the menus of Chinese restaurants, so I have little 
information. The largest was 4.04 inches across the long way and 9-5/8 
ounces. Yield for the batch was 6-5/8 ounces from 2 ponds 13-1/4 ounces 
(14.6%). At 2016 US $3.99 / pound, that's $27.33 per pound edible, but

    Northern Europe)
  <br><b>Gould's Razor Clam;</b> <i>Solon strictus</i> (East Asia) all 
    of family <i>Pharidae</i>]
<p>
All the genera listed above look much like the photo specimens, except 
the Pacific (<i>Siliqua patula</i>) which is much shorter. Most are 
Norther Hemisphere clams, but one species, Navaja (<i>Ensis macha</i>), 
inhabits both coasts of South America and is a significant commercial 
catch in Chile. Razor Clams feature a digging foot at one end and a 
double siphon at the other, Razor clams are very highly regarded as 
food but are difficult to catch because they can dig down faster than 
a person can dig them up.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased live at a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles at 2013 US $5.49/pound. They may be <i>Ensis directus</i> 
or an almost identical species. The longest was 5.88 inches long 
and 7/8 inch wide. They typically weighed 1.63 ounces and yielded 0.63 
ounce steamed edible (39%). The open photo specimen to the right has

<h2>Great Shipworm</h2>

[<i>Teredo navalis</i> of family <i>Teredinidae</i>]
<p>
This marine destroyer of wood causes tremendous economic damage in 
tropical and temperate waters worldwide. Though called a "worm" it is 
actually a clam related to the Geoduck and Softshell Clam. The shell, 
at the head end, is tiny and modified to act as a drill for boring into 
wood. They have a symbiotic relationship with a bacteria that breaks 
down cellulose into a form the shipworm can digest. This clam can grow 
to 24 inches long and nearly 1/2 inch in diameter.</p>
<p>Despite their slippery and unappetizing appearance, they are eaten in 
Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and the Philippines. In Thailand 
they are hunted in the mangrove forests and eaten raw, or in a soup-like 
curry, chopped up along with tender inner leaves of banana blossom. They 
taste similar to other clams.

<p>
This very large clam (often over 6.5 inches) is found in the northwest 
Atlantic from the southern Gulf of St. Laurence, Canada, to the Gulf of 
Mexico. It is triangular in shape and lives in sand just to the sea side 
of the surf zone. In the U.S. the foot (called "tongue") is used 
to make clam strips and the strap meat around the edge of the shell and 
the adductor muscles that closes the shell are chopped and used for clam 
chowder and similar recipes. The foot is also exported to Japan for use 
as sushi. It is larger than the foot of their local surf clams.

[Hokkigai (Japan); Stimpson's Surf Clam; <i>Mactromeris polynyma</i> 
  of family <i>Mactridae</i>]<p>
This clam, similar to the Atlantic Surf Clam but a little smaller. There 
are several subspecies. These clams are found along the northeast coast 
of North America from Rhode Island north through the Gulf of St. Laurence, 
and far offshore in the Grand Banks. Other subspecies are found all 
around Southern Alaska, Japan and the north coast of China. As with the 
Atlantic Surf Clam, the foot, strap meat and adductor muscle are edible. 
The main market is Japan for sushi. It has not much penetrated the 
American market due to a color difference with the Atlantic Surf Clam, 
though experimental aquaculture is under way in the Gulf of Maine

<h2>Venus Clam</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvvenus02e.jpg" alt="Venus Clams" class=mrg>
[family <i>Veneridae</i>; species unidentified]
<p>
While a number of the hard shell clams above (family <i>Veneridae</i>) 
are "venus clams", this one was not further identified, and I have not 
been able to pin it to a specific species. It is similar to the 
Sunray Venus Clam (<i>Macrocallista nimbosa</i>) which is now entering 
aquaculture production on the southeast coast of the US, but is not 
identical.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased from a Philippine market in 
Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2017 US $2.99 / pound. They were up to 
2.38 inches long, 2.15 inches wide, 1.25 inches thick and weighed an 
average of 2.26 ounces each. Edible yield was 0.19 ounces each (8.4%)
steamed, or about US $35.60 per edible pound.

<h2>White Clam</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvwhite08e.jpg" alt="Asian White Clams" class=mrg>
[Asian Hard Clam; <i>Meretrix lyrata</i> of family <i>Veneridae</i>]
<p>
This small clam is a major seafood export for Vietnam, packaged as whole frozen 
clams or as cooked clam meat. It is easily recognized by the white shell and 
the dark black streak covering one of the side edges just as though it had 
been dipped in paint.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were on the large size at 2 inches long and 1.2 
ounces each 15-1/8 ounces yielded 1-3/8 ounces of clam meat (9%), or 
about US $33 per pound. Since you can buy a pound of frozen white clam 
meat for about $3 per pound, in the shell is clearly a decorator item. 
Use them when you want picturesque open clams in your soup bowl like 
in the cookbook photos.

<p>[<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> &amp; <i>Dreissena bugensis</i> of family 
<i>Veneridae</i>]
</p><p>
While called "mussels", these troublesome invasives are actually fresh 
water Venus Clams. Like mussels, they attach themselves to solid 
substrates with byssal threads. Originally from the rivers of Russia 
and Ukraine, they are spreading all over the United States due to 
recreational boating taking them from one body of water to another. 
They reproduce in incredible numbers, and are now also a problem 
in Europe.</p>
<p>There are few natural predators in North America to control them. 
Predators that do eat them may also carry toxins and diseases up the 
food chain, particularly botulism. While they are usually less than 1 
inch in size (2 inches is very unusual) their extreme numbers clog up 
water intake pipes and many other underwater structures. These clams 
are edible, but eating them is strongly discouraged due to toxins 
and bacteria they may cocentrate.

may have radial stripes of various colors but not green.</p> 
<p>The photo specimens, sold in a Philippine market in Los Angeles as 
"Black Mussel" are probably Pacific Blue Mussels. They were small ones 
at 2.38 inches long, 1.21 inches across and 081 inch thick. This type 
of mussel can grow at least an inch longer. They averaged 0.48 ounces 
each and yielded 0.083 ounces steamed edible (17%). At 2013 US 
$2.99/pound that comes to $17.52/ pound edible. In the photo, the closed 
ones are live and the open one has been steamed. They had good flavor, 
much more delicate than New Zealand mussels.

predecessors for about 15,000 years. They have orange flesh and can grow 
to 8 inches long but are generally a lot smaller. They are still gathered 
for human consumption and for use as bait but not as a commercial crop. 
Care must be taken in harvesting and consumption because they can be 
quite toxic during periods of "red tide".

This oyster is native to the East Coast of North America and the 
North American coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It is smoother than the 
Pacific Oyster and not as deep shelled. Populations were once vast, 
but many have been greatly reduced out by over-harvesting. They are 
now being farmed along the Northeast Coast and in Washington's Puget 
Sound where they are called "Totten Inlet Virginica". The shell is 
generally elongated, but quite variable in shape, and will be 
marketed at from 2 to 5 inches across the widest point.</p>

[European Flat Oyster, Mud Oyster; <i>Ostrea edulis</i>]
<p>
This oyster is native to the eastern coast of the Atlantic, from Norway 
to Morocco and in the Mediterranean. They were introduced to the North 
American coast in the mid 20th century and have established natural 
populations. It is being farmed in Maine, Washington and California, for 
sale at a higher price than other oysters. The flavor is described as 
"dry and metallic". they are considered excellent for eating raw on the 
half shell. Adults measure 1.5 to 4.3 inches across.

<h2>Olympia Oyster</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvoyoly01k.jpg" alt="Olympia Oyster on the Half Shell" class=mrg>
[<i>Ostrea lurida</i>]<p>
This is the native Pacific oyster, found from southeast Alaska to 
Baja but most common in bays and estuaries of the state of Washington. 
It has a thick irregularly shaped fluted shell which may range from white 
through purple to black in color and rarely grows larger than 1-1/2 inch 
across.</p>
<p>Formerly this oyster was so abundant in the Pacific Northwest it spawned 
a major shellfish industry in Washington state. By the early 20th century 
stocks were so decimated by over-harvesting, pollution and silt from highway 
construction oyster growers had to bring in the Pacific Oyster to stay 
in business. Olympias disappeared entirely from the once abundant Puget Sound 
area and were extremely low elsewhere. Stocks have recovered a bit in some 
areas and efforts are being made to assist their recovery but populations 
are still at low levels. They have also reappeared in San Francisco Bay 
in California, spawning a restoration effort there.

<h2>Pacific Oyster</h2>

[Japanese Oyster, Miyagi Oyster, Kumamoto Oyster, 
<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>]
<p>
Native to the coasts of Japan, Korea and China, the Pacific Oysters grown 
on the U.S. West Coast were brought from Japan in 1912.  They are 
primarily an aquaculture crop but some wild populations now exist in 
Washington, British Columbia and elsewhere. They have now been 
distributed worldwide and grow on many non-tropical coasts. Pacific 
oysters can reach a length of as much as 10 inches but are generally 
marketed much smaller.</p>

<p>They are easily recognized by their large size and deep very rough shells 
(Atlantic oysters are smoother and European oysters are smoother and 
rather flat). They are often sold named by the location grown, such as 
Wescott Bays, Shoalwaters, Quilcenes and Willapa Bays.</p>

<p>A clumping species, Pacific oysters were originally unsuitable for the 
"half-shell" market so were shucked in factories and packed in jars. 
Today the emphasis is on growing solitary oysters for sale live. A new 
variety (Kumamoto) has become popular and has a particularly deep shell 
making it ideal for "half-shell" service.

<h2 id=scal class=lrg>Scallops</h2>

<p>Scallops are unique among bivalves in that they can see a lot better, 
having up to a hundred reflective eyes along the edge of their mantles, 
and most are free of any attachment (Zen mollusks?) and can swim. Some 
are even migratory.</p>
<p>The only parts of a scallop that are eaten are the large cylindrical 
adductor muscle and the roe, both male (white) and female (red). The 
muscles are sold in two forms: "dry pack" and "wet pack". Wet pack 
scallops are treated with sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) which causes 
them to absorb a lot of water before freezing. "Wet pack" is more 
profitable to the seller, but quite disappointing to the buyer, as they 
shrink badly during cooking.</p>
<p>There is a fair amount of scallop farming, 80% of it in China and 
10% in Japan, Russia being a distant third. Unlike fish and shrimp 
farming, bivalve farming is considered ecologically neutral to 
beneficial.</p>

<h2>Atlantic Sea Scallop</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvscalop03h.jpg" alt="Atlantic Scallop Shell" class=mrg>
[<i>Placopecten magellanicus</i>]
<p>
Native to the northeastern coast of North America, from the north shore 
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence south to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, this 
scallop provides by far the largest scallop harvest in the world. They 
were over-harvested at one time but have rebounded to record levels. The 
harvest is now considered sustainable.</p>
<p>These scallops are caught by dredging and now by divers. Diver 
harvesting is less ecologically damaging and provides a better product. 
There is some minor scallop farming of this species within their normal 
range. These scallops are up to 6-1/2 inches across (the photo specimen 
is just under 6 inches) and they are generally a pinkish color.

<h2>Bay Scallop</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvscalop05h.jpg" alt="Bay Scallop Shell" class=mrg>
[<i>Argopecten irradians</i> and others]<p>
Bay scallops are much smaller than the sea scallops. A. irradians is 
native to the northeastern coast of North America, and once supported a 
large fishery. These scallops have greatly declined due to the usual 
coastal problems, mostly from development, but also from over-harvesting 
of the sharks that ate the rays that eat the scallops. Today, nearly all 
A. irradians in the markets are farmed in China, though some are farmed 
in the Eastern US. The photo specimen, species unknown, is 3 inches 
across.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Oysters:</h3>  &nbsp; These bivalves are a well balanced food 
containing protein, carbohydrates and lipids and are low in cholesterol. 
Oysters are an excellent source of vitamins D, C, A, B1(thiamin), B2 
(riboflavin), B3 (niacin), iron, copper, iodine, magnesium, calcium, 
zinc, manganese and phosphorus in good nutritional proportions.<p></p>

<h3>WARNING</h3> raw oysters may carry bacteria, so persons with 
compromised immune systems or chronic liver disease should avoid 
eating them raw.<p></p>
