<h1>Cephalopods</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>[Class <i>Cephalopoda</i>]
</p><p>
Cephalopods, the name meaning "head footed", have been here for a 
very long time, some 500 million years. They first appeared in 
recognizable form in the last quarter of the Cambrian period. As far 
as we know, they all originally had shells, but today only the Nautilus 
has a true external shell, and it is restricted to the tropics of the 
Southwest Pacific. The most successful shelled cephalopods were the 
Ammonites (8 orders), which were extremely common for around 340 million 
years, but met extinction in the same ecological disaster that did in 
the dinosaurs. Their curled shells, some simple, some ornate, some up 
to 6 feet in diameter, litter the fossil beds of the world.</p>
<p>The most common cephalopods living today have all given up the 
protective shell for high mobility, but rather than discarding the 
shells, they have used them in innovative ways. Squids use it as a 
body stiffener called a Gladius, and some Octopi also have a Gladius. 
The Cuttlefish has evolved its shell into a porous "cuttlebone" used 
to control flotation. One squid-like cephalopod, <I>Spirula</i>, has a 
shell very similar to a nautilus shell, but entirely within the body, 
used as a flotation device. The female Paper Nautilus (genus 
<i>Argonauta</i>, actually a kind of octopus), creates a shell that is 
both a flotation device and a brood chamber for eggs.<p>
<p>Cephalopods are by far the most intelligent invertebrates. Octopi 
can even figure out how to remove screw caps from jars. Their 
intelligence, however, is composed very differently from ours. With the 
exception of the Nautilus, they have very sophisticated eyes, though 
they are different in design from ours. Their most amazing feature is 
the ability to almost instantly change the pattern and colors of their 
skin to match their background, and in the case of the cuttlefish, even 
change its texture.

<p>Three orders of cephalopods are of culinary importance. Each of 
these orders has multiple detail pages linked from the paragraphs 
below.</p>


<h2>Octopus</h2>
<br><a href="seaocto.html">
<img src="img/sf_octopus13h.jpg" alt="Large and Small Octopi" class=mrg></a>
[Order <i>Octopoda</i>]
<p>
Octopi are considered very good eating everywhere they are found, 
except North America, though even here they are easily available in 
our many Asian markets. There are over 300 species of Octopus worldwide, 
and all are venomous, but only the Blue Ringed Octopi (genus 
<i>Hapalochlaena</i>) are dangerous to humans. These small octopi carry 
enough venom to kill 26 adult humans.

<h2>Squid</h2>
<br><a href="seasquid.html">
<img src="img/sf_squidls03h.jpg" alt="Large and Small Squid" class=mrg></a>
[Order <i>Teuthida</i>]
<p>
Squid are the largest, most mobile and perhaps most intelligent of the 
mollusks. Giant squid grow to over 33 feet from tentacle tip to tail and 
Colossal Squid can exceed 46 feet. These huge squid are suspected of 
being among the most intelligent creatures in the sea. You will not be 
eating one of those because they live too deep to catch and their flesh 
is laced with toxic ammonia anyway. Market size squid (different species) 
are, however, plentiful and good eating.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cuttlefish</h2> 
<br><a href="seacuttl.html">
<img src="img/sf_cf001h.jpg" alt="Whole Cuttlefish" class=mrg></a>
[Order <i>Sepiida</i> Genus <i>Sepia</i>]
<p>
Cuttlefish are found in coastal waters throughout the world - except the 
Americas. Since they are not native to our waters, they are not as well 
known as Squid and Octopus, but they are easily available in our large 
Asian markets here in California, and very good eating.
