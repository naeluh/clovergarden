<h1>Crabs</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Crabs, close relatives to Shrimp and Lobsters, are found in the 
oceans worldwide, some in fresh water and even a few on land. Despite 
humorous names like "Spider Roll" for crab rolls in sushi bars, crabs and 
other crustaceans are related to spiders only at the top phylum level, 
very remotely indeed. </p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Crabs are Crustaceans, a subphylum of the Arthropods (insects and 
spiders are other subphylum). Specifically they belong to the 
<i>Malacostraca</i> branch of crustaceans which also includes shrimp, 
prawns, lobsters and sow bugs.</p>
<p>They are called "decapods", meaning they have 10 legs. The front 
pair is modified with strong claws and in some species the rear pair is 
modified for swimming.</p>
<p>Crabs are built the same as shrimp, except the carapace (head of 
shrimp) has become very wide, the abdomen (tail) has atrophied, 
flattened and folded under the body along with all the swimming feet 
(<i>Pleopods</i>). The abdomen now serves only a reproductive role and 
is wide on females for holding eggs and narrow on males. 
See (<a href="seacrab.html#c07"><b>C7</b></a>) and (<a href="seacrab.html#c08"><b>C8</b></a>) 
for more on decapod and crab anatomy.</p>

<p><br></p>


<h2 id="eat" class=lrg>Eating Crabs</h2>

<p><img src="img/ke_crab01e.jpg" alt="Crab Tools" class=mrg>
Eating crabs requires some tools due to their hard shells and the way 
their meat is divided into small compartments. In any case, it's going 
to be messy and barbaric - highly satisfying but not suitable for elegant 
dinners.</p>
<p>For small crabs steamed whole it's traditional to use yesterday's 
newspaper for a tablecloth so the whole mess can be rolled up and 
disposed of once they've all been eaten.
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Totally worthless:</b> red crab cracker at upper right. Any part 
small enough to fit in this abomination is too small and flexible to be 
cracked, but it came with 4 crab picks which are more useful at about 
2006 US $6. Keep the picks and toss the claw.</li>
<li><b>Oxo Crab Cracker:</b> elegant, extremely well made and can 
actually crush claws (and I do mean "crush") but is too wide for any 
other parts. At 2006 US $10 it's a colossal waste of money.</li>
<li><b>Nutcracker:</b> (not shown) restaurants serve crabs with a cheap 
metal nutcracker to minimize theft. It's about as effective as the Oxo, 
but a bit more difficult to handle.</li>
<li><b>Kitchen Shears:</b> the crab eating tool without parallel. Cuts 
crab parts neatly both crosswise and lengthwise - it's the <i>only</i> 
way to go!</li>
<li><b>Crab Picks:</b> The shovel end is very useful particularly for the 
body parts of smaller crabs. Haven't figured out any use for the forked 
end. Four of them came with that useless red claw at about US $6.</li>
<li><b>Chopsticks:</b> extremely useful for pushing meat out of tubular 
legs and other parts - and for dipping small pieces of crab into whatever 
sauce you are using. Highly recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crabs, crab legs and claws are generally eaten with some sort of dip. 
Here are some examples, with my own preference listed last.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../recipes/2jx_joescrab1.html"><b>Joe's Mustard Sauce:</b>
</a> &nbsp; The sauce served with crab claws at the famous <i>Joe's 
Stone Crab</i> restaurant in Florida. Clearly this fine establishment 
serves it's customers well. Personally though, when I pay for crab I 
hope to taste crab. I find this sauce tasty and well suited to celery 
sticks, cold meats and spreading on sandwiches.</li>
<li><b>Melted Butter</b> and <b>Lemon Wedges</b>: &nbsp; pretty good, 
but skim off the white foam that forms at the top, it's way too salty 
and detracts from the crab. The lemon wedges are a little awkward to 
apply - maybe a tiny dish with lemon juice in it to dip before the 
butter?</li>
<li><b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Presumably best quality white wine vinegar, 
but I find straight vinegar a bit, well, vinegary. Maybe white balsamic 
instead?</li>
<li><a href="../recipes/1jx_cgcrab1.html"><b>CG Crab Dip:</b></a> - here 
the acidity of the vinegar is cut to 1/3 with white wine and a little warm 
spice is added. Best feature is that you can still taste the crab!</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying <small>&amp;</small> Storing Crabs</h2>

<p>Buy crabs live (unless you're buying them already cooked). Crabs spoil 
extremely quickly when dead and there's no way to tell how long they've 
been dead. Don't cook dead crabs.</p>

<p>The exception to the dead crab rule is if you put a bag of crabs you 
knew were all alive in your refrigerator overnight you can still cook 
them in the morning. They'll be dead from the cold and they'll be "fresh 
crabs" rather than "live crabs" but they'll still be plenty edible.</p>

<p>Live crabs can survive several days out of water if conditions are 
correct (how long depends on species). Keep them at about 
50&deg;F/10&deg;C in a moist environment but with decent air circulation. 
Covering with damp straw or something similar works well.</p>

<p>When buying cooked crabs (the only way larger, spindlier species are 
sold), buy from a reliable source with plenty of seafood turnover.</p>

<p>If your supermarket has crab legs or "clusters" displayed in the case 
and in shrink wrapped trays, if the price is anywhere near the same, hail 
the fish man and  buy from the case. Those in the trays may be weighed 
frozen, and exude water as they thaw and you may find you're paying for 
some pretty expensive water in the tray.</p>

<h2 id="kill">Killing Crabs</h2>

<p>Since you bought them live, you have to kill them yourself. I can 
assure you the crabs don't enjoy this any more than you do. There are 
a number of ways:
<ul>
<li>Plunge the crab face first into plenty of rapidly boiling water. All 
  motion stops in less than a second - the brain is right up front.</li>
<li>Sedate the crab and split from the bottom as shown in the instructions 
  for  <a href="sf_cbdungz.html">Dungeness Crabs</a> or 
  <a href="sf_cbrockz.html">Rock Crabs</a>. Motion stops in less than 10 
  seconds.</li>
<li>Sedate the crab and Split the chassis away from the shell as shown in 
  instructions for <a href="sf_cbbluez.html">Blue Crabs</a>. Motion stops 
  in about one minute but the crab is probably not conscious.</li>
<li>Refrigerate overnight. Time of death will be uncertain but they'll be 
  refrigerated the whole time.</li>
<li><b>Softshell Crabs Only:</b> with kitchen shears cut off the face 
  behind the eyes. This should take the crab out very quickly.</li> 
<li>Some say to put the crab in water and slowly warm it up and the crab 
  will "go to sleep". I tried this and the crab got plenty agitated so I 
  discontinued the experiment.</li>
<li>Steaming live is the way it's done in the Chesapeake Bay area. 
  Dropping a basket of live blue crabs over rapidly boiling water and 
  putting a lid   on is probably fairly quick but would seem more painful 
  than other methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties of Crab</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Asian Shore Crab</h2>
<br><a href="sf_cbgrntdlz.html">
<img src="img/sf_cbashor01h.jpg" alt="Whole Asian Shore Crab" class=mrg></a>
[Japanese shore crab; <i>Hemigrapsus sanguineus</i>]
<p>This crab is native from Peter the Great Bay in far south eastern 
Russia down to Hong Kong. It is now a serious invasive pest along the 
northeastern coast of the United States, and has also been found in Texas 
and the Pacific Northwest. Best control is to eat them. Unfortunately, 
Americans, especially along the east coast, are not accustomed to eating 
tiny crabs shell and all. It has also infested Europe from the North 
Sea down the coast of France and around England. This crab is very like 
the Green Tidal Crab <i>Varuna litterata</i> except not configured for 
swimming. In the Philippines they share the name, Talangka, and the same 
recipes are used. It can be found in several colors, from green to 
orange-brown and purple. This crab can grow to a carapace width of around 
1.6 inches but is more commonly 1 inch or a little over. For culinary 
details see

<h2>Blue Crab</h2>
<br><a href="sf_cbbluez.html">
<img src="img/sf_cbblue02e.jpg" alt="Angry Blue Crab 02e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Callinectes sapidus</i>]
<p>
Blue Crabs are found from Nova Scotia to northern Argentina, but are 
most abundant from Massachusetts on down and around the coast to Texas. 
They are particularly important to the economy in the Chesapeake Bay area 
of Maryland and Virginia. They can grow to about 9.1 inches across the 
points of the shell, but the photo example was 7 inches and weighed 
8-3/4 ounces.</p>
<p>This is a highly mobile "swimming crab" which can travel a couple 
hundred miles seasonally. It is very active and feisty and you don't 
want to get pinched because the claws are very strong. Populations 
in the Chesapeake Bay have been declining and major experimental 
hatcheries have been established to try to reverse the decline. The 
demand is so great crabs are now being imported from as far away as 
Texas.

<p>
Mitten crabs are native to East Asia, from Korea south to Fujian, China. 
They are considered a serious invasive in North American and Europe, 
but have failed (2019) to establish significant populations in North 
America. These are freshwater crabs, but must migrate downriver to 
brackish waters to spawn. They can grow to 3.9 inches across the 
carapace.

<h2>Dungeness Crab</h2>
<br><a href="sf_cbdungz.html">
<img src="img/sf_cbdung17h.jpg" alt="Two Dungeness Crabs" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Cancer magister</i>]
<p>
This popular crab is found from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska south to 
Santa Barbara, California and is the most economically important crab on 
the U.S. West Coast. The photo specimens are 6-3/4 inch across the 
carapace, a typical market size. The rear one was purchased pre-cooked 
and the front one live. These crabs are also sold as "clusters", half a 
crab chassis with legs and claws attached, and about 60% of the catch 
is rendered into canned and frozen crab meat.</p>

<p>These crabs can grow to 10 inches across the carapace but few get the 
chance because the fishery is very efficient, with between 80% and 90% of 
legal  crabs caught in any particular year. Legal crabs are sexually 
mature males greater than 6-1/4" across the carapace. By then they're 
about 4 years old and have had plenty of time to knock up enough females 
to keep the population going. Nearly all the California / Oregon / 
Washington catch is between 15 November and New Years Day, though the 
season goes on to mid July. There are other smaller catches through the 
crab's full range which keep them available much of the year. These 
crabs are not endangered.

<h2>European Green Crab</h2>
<br><a href="sf_cbgrntdlz.html">
<img src="img/sf_cbeurog01e.jpg" alt="Whole European Green Crab" class=mrg></a>
[Shore Crab; <i>Carcinus maenas</i>]
<p>This crab is native to Europe, from Iceland and central Norway down to 
Morocco. It is a serious invasive along the northwest Atlantic coast 
from Newfoundland, Canada to South Carolina, United States, and along 
the east Pacific coast from Vancouver Island, Canada down to central 
California. On the U.S. east coast it is battling with the invasive 
Asian Shore Crab. It has also invaded southern Australia, the southern 
tip of Africa, and a small area in southern Argentina. It is green after 
a molt, but becomes increasingly brown / orange as it nears its next molt.
</p>
<p>This is a small crab, growing to only 3-1/2 inches across the 
carapace, limiting its culinary usage. In the northeast region of the 
United States, there are efforts, with some success, to develop culinary 
uses for these crabs, and one chef is using crab stock made from them 
in recipes. They are also harvested for use as bait. Native crabs have 
beeen effective in controlling this crab in some regions. Adult crabs 
are often 20 to a square meter on the east coast, but only about 0.3 
crabs per square meter in infested west coast regions. We have tougher 
native crabs on the west coast.

<p>This crab is found in brackish waters and far up rivers. It is found 
from the east coast of Africa to the Mid Pacific Islands, ranging from 
Japan to southern Australia. This crab is very like the Asian Shore Crab 
<i>Hemigrapsus sanguineus</i> and they share the name. Talangka. in the 
Philippines. Both are about the same size and have a blocky carapace 
with three teeth, but this one has hairy legs to help with swiming and 
the mouth parts are different. It can be found in several colors.

<h2>King Crab</h2>
<br><a href="sf_cbkingz.html">

[Alaskan King Crab, Red King Crab, <i>Paralithodes camtschaticus</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; Blue King Crab, <i>Paralithodes platypus</i>  &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; Golden King Crab, Brown King Crab, <i>Lithodes aequispinus</i>]
<p>
King crabs are not actually crabs but belong to another family of Decapods, 
the Lithodidae. They are thought to have evolved from hermit crabs 
(also not true crabs). Because of their size and spindly shape they are 
cooked immediately upon capture and broken into legs and claw arms which 
are shipped (generally frozen) to markets.</p>
<p>The three crabs listed in the title are all from Alaska, the Blue King 
being the largest, the Red King second largest and the Golden King 
considerably smaller (thus lower in price). All three are marketed as 
"Alaskan King Crab" and all are pretty much the same red color when 
cooked so you can't tell them apart in the market. The larger of the 
legs was 18 inches long and weighed 14 ounces. The claw was 9.8 inches 
long and weighed 12.5 ounces. Blue King legs can be over 28 inches long.
</p>
<p>This crab is difficult to catch and is not considered endangered. It 
was introduced to the Barents sea off Russia in the 1960s and the 
population there has exploded and spread as far away as Norway, to the 
dismay of ecologists and many fishermen, and the delight of others who 
enjoy the high price they fetch.

&nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Episesarma versicolour</i> (purple and white claws); 
all of Family <i>Sesarmidae</i>]
<p>
These crabs, which can grow to about 2 inches across the shell, live in 
the mangrove forests of Southeast Asia. When the tide comes in, they climb 
mangrove trees to just above the water level, though they can climb as 
high as 20 feet in search of leaves to eat. They are considered pests in 
mangrove plantations because they eat the mangrove seedlings. The 
Teochew Chinese of Southeast Asia catch them, keep them in clean water 
for two days, then pickle them live in vinegar and/or soy sauce. They are 
served whole. In Thailand they are used as an alternative to 
<a href="sf_cbpadz.html"><b>Rice Paddy Crabs</b></a> for salted crabs 
and crab paste, and they are also fried whole.

<p>
These crabs, found pretty much worldwide, are parasites on bivalve 
mollusks and some other sea animals. They are totally dependent on 
the host for food, oxygen and protection. They usually do little 
damage to the host, which is still completely edible - just eat the 
crab or discard it, as you please. The photo specimen was 0.41 inches 
across the shell, and was found inside an Asian Littleneck Clam.

<p>
There are  other crabs called "Black Crab", but the very small crabs of 
this genus (up to 2 inches across the shell) are very important 
commercially in Southeast Asia. They are salt fermented and ground up to 
make Crab Paste, and are salt fermented whole and packaged for sale as 
"Salted Black Crabs". They are popular in Laos, Issan (northeast 
Thailand) Vietnam and Cambodia. When they feel threatened these crabs 
wave their claws threateningly and blow a screen of bubbles.The photo

and can grow to nearly 8 inches wide across the carapace. The photo 
specimen was a male 6 inches across the carapace and weighing 1 pound 
13oz (1.8 pounds).</p>
<p>This crab is not to be confused with the very common Atlantic rock

periodically molt its entire exoskeleton and grow a new larger one. After 
the molt the crab is highly vulnerable for a period of days until the new 
shell hardens. This is the "soft shell" crab of commerce.

has outsized claws with enough strength to break oyster shells.</p>
<p>The fishery is unique and highly regulated in the United States. Live 
crabs are taken only during season and if both claws meet a size standard 
the larger is twisted off at a joint and the crab is returned to the 
water to grow a new claw (takes about a year). Taking whole crabs is 
illegal, as is taking both claws.

<p>Crab is an excellent sources of chromium and selenium and a good 
source of several other important minerals. It is high in vitamins, 
particularly B12, high in protein and very low in fat. It has less than 
1/3 the cholesterol of shrimp (about the same as salmon), but most people 
don't absorb much cholesterol from their food anyway.</p>

<p>Crab is too low on the food chain to contain significant amounts of 
mercury.</p>
