<h1>Cleaning <small>and</small> Dismantling Large Cuttlefish</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_cf001g.jpg" alt="Whole Cuttlefish" class=mrg>
[<i>Sepia pharaonis</i> (and others)]
<p>
This "cleaning and dismantling" page features a Pharaoh Cuttlefish, 
as that is the only large cuttlefish available in the Indo-Pacific 
region. While no Cuttlefish are native to either coast of the Americas, 
this one is shipped to California from Vietnam, so available in the 
large Asian markets here in Los Angeles. The same instructions should 
work for the Common Cuttlefish, found off the east coasts of Europe and 
Africa, as well as the Mediterranean.

<h2>Removing the Cuttlebone</h2>
<p>There is relatively little cutting to dismantling a cuttlefish. Most 
of it is just pulled apart by hand, but the first thing you do is make 
ad cut through the skin at the front of the mantle just above the 
cuttlebone and another just below it. The Cuttlebone can then be 
pushed and pulled out through the cut.</p>

<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf012f.jpg" alt="Opening the Cuttlefish" class=mrg>
<h2>Opening the Cuttlefish</h2>
<p>Now you want to make a single cut through the skin at the top of 
the Cuttlefish. Hold the skin up so you don't cut into the stuff that's 
below it. Then, get your fingers in between the fin meat and the 
inside meat and pull outward to expose the sack of innards inside.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf015f.jpg" alt="Freeing the Fins" class=mrg>
<h2>Freeing the fins</h2>
<p>You need to make a short cut up at the front on each side and 
a shorter cut at the back where the fins meet to free them so you 
can open the Cuttlefish wider.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf018f.jpg" alt="Cuttlefish is Wide Open" class=mrg>
<h2>Cuttlefish is Wide Open</h2>
<p>Just pull the fin sides out to open the Cuttlefish wide.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf021f.jpg" alt="The Sack is Pulled Loose" class=mrg>
<h2>Pull the Sack Loose</h2>
<p>Now get your fingers in under the sack of innards and pull it loose 
at the aft end. Now pull off the Head along with the sack of innards 
and set the body aside.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf026f.jpg" alt="Head is Pulled Off with Sack" class=mrg>
<h2 id="head">Head is Pulled Off with Sack</h2>
<p>Pull or cut loose any membranes so you have the head separated from 
the sack of innards, which can be discarded. Clean up the head well 
under running water. In a separate compartment there will be the liver, 
which is brown. It may still be in its two pouches or may be just a 
bunch of brown stuff. Clean that all so your head looks as in the photo.
</p>
<h3>If doing a Precleaned Cuttlefish</h3> &nbsp; You can just pull 
out the head and proceed through the following steps, skipping removing 
the Eyes, Beak and Skin. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf029f.jpg" alt="Meaty Parts Cut from Head" class=mrg>
<h2>Meaty Parts Cut from Head </h2>
<p>Continue to remove loose membranes and cut off the two long meaty 
parts. Do not discard them.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf032f.jpg" alt="Further Clean-up of the Head" class=mrg>
<h2>Further Clean-up of the head.</h2>
<p>Right at the back of the head you will feel some stiff parts. Cut 
them loose and discard (they're shown top center in the photo. Remove 
the rest of the meaty parts and do not discard them.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf035f.jpg" alt="Eyes Removed" class=mrg>
<h2>Cut out the Eyes</h2>
<p>Cut around the eyes and remove them. if you cut too close and they 
deflate, that's not a problem - you're tossing them out. Just rinse 
the head to clean up. 
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf043f.jpg" alt="Pull off the Skin" class=mrg>
<h2>Pull off the Skin</h2>
<p>Get a grip on the skin at the back of the head, first at the 
bottom and pull slowly toward the arms. It will break loose from 
the arms where it gets thin. Now, do the same with the skin at 
the top of the head. The skin left on the arms is too thin to 
be a bother. 
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf046f.jpg" alt="Eye Sockets cut off" class=mrg>
<h2>Cut off the Eye Sockets</h2>
<p>The eye sockets are very stiff, so remove them. This will also 
expose the inside of the mouth. So you can push out the beak and 
cut it off.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf048f.jpg" alt="Beak Removed" class=mrg>
<h2>Remove the Beak</h2>
<p>Stick a finger in the hole at the back of the arms and 
push the beak out the front where you can cut it off.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf053f.jpg" alt="Cut the Arms Free" class=mrg>
<h2>Cut the Arms Free</h2>
<p>Make a cut through the arm ring between the largest arms 
so you can spread them out. Now cut each arm free from its neighbors. 
At this point, if there is too much of the colored skin on one or more 
arms, you can shave it off with your filleting knife. You'll 
probably want to cut those two long tentacles into about the same 
lengths as the arms.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf056f.jpg" alt="Reomve the body Meat" class=mrg>
<h2>Remove the Body Meat</h2>
<p>Use your fingers to pull the body meat loose from the fins and belly 
skin. 
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf059f.jpg" alt="Body Meat Separated" class=mrg>
<h2>Clean the Body Meat</h2>
<p>Remove any clinging membranes and other stuff. It may help to 
scrub it on both sides with coarse seas salt as an abrasive. Don't 
discard the stuff over on the right - there's still meat to be 
recovered there.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf062f.jpg" alt="Body Meat Trimmed" class=mrg>
<h2>Trim the Body Meat</h2>
<p>Make a thin cut across the straight edge and cut off the stiff 
fin along the curved edges. 
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/sf_cf064f.jpg" alt="Fin Meat Recovered" class=mrg>
<h2>Pull and Trim Fin Meat</h2>
<p>Pull the strips of white meat off the fin skins and belly. You 
will find a thin translucent fin cartilage attached to each of the 
strips. Use your filleting knife to shave it off the meat. Discard 
cartilage and skins.
