<h1>Echinoderms</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>Echinoderms (Phylum <i>Echinodermata</i>) first appeared in the early 
Cambrian period over 500 million years ago. They have neither an internal 
nor an external skeleton but are stiffened by hard calcified plates and 
spines just under the skin. Few have any food value but several provide 
popular delicacies. &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General &amp; History</h2>


<p>Echinoderms first appeared in the early Cambrian period over 500 
million years ago. They have neither an internal nor an external skeleton 
but are stiffened by hard calcified plates and spines just under the skin. 
While this may seem like an exoskeleton it allows the organism to grow 
without molting it's shell.</p>

<p>These creatures have no muscles to speak of but are hydraulically 
operated through a system of plumbing called the "water vascular system". 
Without muscle tissue there isn't a lot to eat in most echinoderms. The 
exception is the sea cucumber which has a tube like body made of 
gelatinous material that is a popular food item in East and Southeast 
Asia.</p>


<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Buying, Cleaning <small>&amp;</small> Cooking</h2>

<p>Unless you are in a sushi bar you are unlikely to buy edible 
echinoderms except sea cucumbers. These are available in markets serving 
East and Southeast Asian communities. Decades ago they were sold as 
dried pieces in boxes, but this is not common now. Today both white and 
black are sold frozen in bags, or thawed in shrink wrapped trays.</p>
<p>There is very little to do in preparing these. Dried ones you need to 
soak for hours. Frozen need to be thawed, checked for any gooey 
stuff that should be washed out, and cut to the size you wish.</p>
<p>If you are in a sushi bar you can order "uni" (sea urchin reproductive 
organs) but there's still little to do - these are prepared "ready to 
serve" by seafood companys that shuck the spiny critters right after 
capture.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Sea Cucumber</h2>
<br><a href="sf_edcukez.html">
<img src="img/sf_edcuke02e.jpg" alt="Sea Cucumbers" class=mrg></a>
[B&ecirc;che-de-mer, order <i>Holothuroidea</i>]<p>
Sea cucumbers are known from the Silurian 400 million years ago, but may 
be even more ancient. Today they live in every marine environment from 
tidal to the deepest trenches, but not in fresh water or on land. They 
should not be called "sea slugs" because they are not mollusks.</p>
<p>Most sea cucumbers are less than 12 inches long, but there is one 
that can grow to more than 7 feet. They are of pharmaceutical interest 
(interesting toxins, mostly) and are a popular food item in Asia. They 
are exported to China from all over the Indo-Pacific region and have been 
badly over-fished in some areas, particularly the Pacific islands. This 
has resulted in development of large aquaculture oprations in China, 
Japan, Australia and elsewhere.

<h2>Sea Urchins</h2>
<br><a href="sf_edurchinz.html">
<img src="img/sf_edurchin01e.jpg" alt="Live Red Urchin" class=mrg></a>
[class <i>Echinoidea</i> many orders, genera and species]
<p>
Sea urchins are a favorite food of sea otters and California spiny 
lobsters. Their reproductive organs are eaten by people, sometimes 
lightly cooked in French sauces, but most commonly raw, mostly in Japan, 
Korea, Chile and California sushi bars.</p>
<p>Sea Urchins are harvested in California (where they are a popular 
sushi), New England (where they are NOT eaten, thank you very much), 
Chile, Japan and other places. They are shelled in the seafood factories 
and the edible organs are put up in rows in little wooden or plastic 
trays, ready to eat.</p>
<p>Here in Southern California Sea urchins are highly destructive to our 
economically important kelp beds, so it would be better if more people 
ate them. Perhaps they would be more popular if it were widely known that 
sea urchin reproductive organs contain cannabinoids and are considered 
aphrodesiac as well. In Japan these organs are called "Uni" and in Chile 
they are called "erizo". Go to your local sushi bar and order Uni, the 
lobsters and sea otters can't handle them all without your help (yes, 
I like uni and order it often).

<h2>Starfish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_edstar01e.jpg" alt="Live Orange Starfish" class=mrg>
[Sea Star, class <i>Asteroidea</i> eight orders and numerous species]
<p>
The main culinary importance of starfish is the number of clams they eat 
which impacts the price and availability of clams. Starfish are 
hydraulically operated rather than muscle operated so they can apply 
force indefinitely without tiring. They use this feature to pull open 
the shells of bivalves, then exude their stomach into the shell and 
digest the occupant in place.</p>
<p>There really isn't a lot edible in a starfish, but that doesn't stop 
the Chinese, who eat them deep fried. They are also eaten in Japan and 
Indonesia, but care must be taken as some species are toxic and others 
contain bitter saponins. Live starfish can be plunged into boiling salted 
water for about 4 minutes, then quenched in cold water. You break off a 
leg and then split it open along the bottom side. Starfish flesh 
is gray and has little flavor, so dips are in order.

<h2 id="med" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>You are unlikely to depend on echinoderms for a significant part of 
your nutrition so it's sufficient to say those sold in commerce are safe 
to eat in any normal amount, so long as they lived in unpolluted 
seawater. They are way too far down the food chain to contain significant 
amounts of mercury.</p>
<p>Some <b>Sea Cucumbers</b> contain interesting toxins but those sold in 
general commerce are safe to eat.</p>
<p><b>Sea Urchin</b> reproductive organs (uni) contain cannabinoids and 
are traditionally considered aphrodisiac, but neither in harmful amounts.
