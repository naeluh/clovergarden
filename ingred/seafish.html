Fish were the first vertebrates and have dominated the seas and 
rivers from the time they first appeared. We, and all the other 
mammals, reptiles and birds, are descended from a variety of fish called 
<i>Sarcopterygii</i> (Lobe Finned Fish) - unless you are a "Creationist" 
or "Intelligent Designer" - in which case God saved a lot of time 
designing you by simply kluging his successful fish design, resulting in 
some pretty funky engineering. So, in either case, what's inside a fish 
is pretty much the same as what's inside you - just arranged 
differently. Fish of this class still living include <i>Coelacanths</i> 
and Lungfish.</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Fish have been trapped for eating in lakes and rivers since paleolithic 
times and even sea fishing predates the dawn of history. Fish farming 
began in Egypt at least 4000 years ago with ponds of 
<a href="sf_tilapz.html"><b>Tilapia</b></a>.
</p>
<br>



<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties <small>of</small> Fish</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_snappr1c.jpg" alt="Fish" class=mrg>
Our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page lists 
fish that are either of wide culinary interest or marketed in Southern 
California. It's a very large page with a lot of pictures so be patient 
if you have a slow connection. Most fish on that page will have a 
"Details and Cooking" link to a detail page specific to that fish.</p>
<p>If you want more fish, or more information about a particular fish, 
Fishbase (<a href="seafish.html#f09">F9</a>) lists over 34,100 species of fish 
under over 324,100 common names and with over 59,400 photos - but they 
have no culinary information at all.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying Fish</h2>

<p>The three keys to buying fish are Fresh, Fresh and Fresh. The 
advantages of buying whole fish are that you can be sure what kind of 
fish it is (deception is rampant, both deliberate and accidental) and 
judge freshness more easily. You can also use the head, bones fins 
and sometimes skins to make fish stock, important for many recipes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>eyes</b> should be clear and not sunken. If the fish was 
  previously frozen (most fish these days) the eyes may be a little 
  sunken, but not badly, and should still be fairly clear.</li>
<li>The <b>flesh</b> should spring back when poked.</li>
<li>There should be no strong <b>fishy smell</b>. Very fresh fish have 
  almost no smell, and smell becomes stronger the longer they've been 
  dead.</li>
<li>Shark, skate and ray will have a distinct ammonia smell if not fresh. 
  Just a faint trace you can deal with but if it's more, pass.</li>
<li>The <b>gills</b> should be bright red. If they are light color or 
  grayish the fish is old. The brightness varies with fish variety and 
  depending on if the fish has been frozen but should never be gray. Note 
  that in some cases the blood runs to the lower gill of a fish on its 
  side so the top one may be pale but the bottom one is bright red. This 
  is OK. They should never be clogged and icky looking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you buy whole fish instead of fillets you'll have more 
work preparing them for cooking, but you'll also have the ingredients for 
fish stock for excellent fish soups and stews. Most fish markets will 
scale and clean the fish you have selected without charge.</p>

<p>Another reason to buy whole fish is that you know what you're paying 
for. "Substitution" is rampant in the fish business, and even in pricey 
sushi bars, especially for the more costly fish.</p>

<p>Commercially frozen fish can be very fresh because on modern fishing 
ships fish can be deep frozen immediately after being caught. Farmed fish 
is also often frozen immediately and without processing. Commercial 
freezing is done very quickly at very low temperatures so there is almost 
no damage to the flesh from growth of ice crystals. At fish markets these 
frozen fish are often put on ice and allowed to thaw slowly as they wait 
for a buyer.</p>

<p>Fish to be eaten raw as sushi or ceviche should have been commercially 
frozen to -4&deg;F/-20&deg;C (Japan) or -10&deg;F/-24&deg;C for 7 days 
(United States) which will kill all fish parasites and most bacteria. 
Preferably buy it still frozen. These temperatures are required for fish 
served in sushi bars in both countries - so your "fresh" toro is actually 
"previously frozen".</p> 

<p>It's best to buy fish from a source that does a lot of volume. I buy 
mostly from markets serving a large Asian population because their 
standards of fresh are more demanding than at your average supermarket 
(I've even seen fish still flopping around on the ice in Asian markets). 
Volume tends to be very high at these markets. At one Philippine market 
in the San Fernando valley I counted 8 guys on the scale and clean line 
working as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Some mainstream supermarkets tend to use expiry dates at the ragged 
edge and apply "Special Today" stickers on the last day, so know your 
market and take care.</p>

<p>Keep frozen fish frozen until just before needed and use it within a 
couple months at most. Frozen fish still degrades in your home freezer 
compartment due to normal temperature fluctuations, particularly oily fish 
like mackerel, tuna and salmon. They will be rancid and inedible in just 
a few months.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="thaw" class=lrg>Thawing Fish</h2>

<p>Almost all sources recommend thawing meat, fish and poultry in the 
refrigerator - a method that takes almost forever and is impossible for 
those of us who start our meal planning as we start to cook. They all 
warn <i>NEVER</i> (emphasis their's) thaw at room temperature.</p>
<p>This advice is <b>Total Bunk</b>, originating from the FDA with no 
research to back it. Not only is it unpredictable (refrigerators vary) 
and risks cross contaminating ready-to-eat foods in the fridge, actual 
research has shown higher bacterial growth than when thawed in cold 
running water or just sitting on the counter at a cool room temperature. 
This applies to all frozen food, not just fish.</p>
<p>Even the hard core bacteriophobes at the USDA (U.S. Department of 
Agriculture) do not object to room temperature thawing in food 
processing facilities. Research supports that position.</p>
<p>The key to safe room temperature or cold water thawing to not let it 
sit beyond thawed. Fortunately these methods don't require you to start 
thawing much before need, but if you find you just aren't ready to cook 
yet when nearly thawed, wrap it in a watertight plastic bag and 
refrigerate until needed.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="store" class=lrg>Storing fish</h2>

<p>Fresh or thawed fish needs to be eaten as soon as possible, but 
sometimes we just can't eat it "right now". Properly done, you can store 
it in a good refrigerator for a day or even two, but otherwise you have 
to freeze it. Even if you have to refreeze fish that had been commercially 
frozen it'll still be fine if you follow the method below.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_store01c.jpg" alt="Bowel Storage Method" class=mrg>
The best way to store fresh or thawed fish overnight (some report good 
results for 2 days) is as shown in the photo.</p>

<p>The bowl has ice in the bottom and the fish is on a grate so all juices 
fall into the bowl below. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
The grate shown is a wok steamer grate purchased from an Asian market.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="freeze" class=lrg>Freezing Fish</h2>

<p>The faster fish is frozen the less damage there will be to the flesh. 
If it freezes slowly, larger ice crystals will grow breaking up the cell 
walls.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the fish for cooking. Cut it into the thinnest pieces suitable 
for the mode of cooking you will use. Keep parts in a bowl of ice water 
as you work.</li>
<li>Make sure the fish is as near freezing as possible all the way 
through. Again, the bowl of ice water, or soak in the coldest part of 
your refrigerator for a couple of hours.</li>
<li>Lay out a thin sheet of plastic film on a flat surface, such as a 
baking sheet and spread pieces of fish on it in a single layer, making 
sure there is good air circulation.</li>
<li>Place in your freezer compartment and keep the door closed as much 
as possible until the fish is frozen through.</li>
<li>Bag in plastic when thoroughly frozen. Seal the bag.</li>
</ol>
<br>


<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking Fish</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_fishcook01c.jpg" alt="Cooking a Fish on a Stick over a Fire" class=mrg >
The objective, when cooking fish by any means, is to cook it the minimum 
time that will cook it through.  Frying fish can be an exception since the 
objective is to be crusty brown on the outside, but keeping the oil hot 
enough for thin pieces and not too hot for thick ones will get your crust 
without burning the outside or overcooking the fish.</p>

<h3>Cooking Fish Whole - Why?</h3> &nbsp; Cooking fish whole with head, 
tail, fins and skin in place will help keep the flesh moist and the 
flavor sealed in. Many urban people have a problem with looking what 
they're eating in the eye though, so you may need to dismantle the fish 
at least partially before serving.<p></p>

<h3>Servings:</h3> &nbsp; Since I don't know how hungry you 
are and fish vary (particularly when whole), this table is only a general 
guide.

<h3>Baking Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Baking is an excellent method particularly 
for whole fish. Essentially, the fish is steamed in its own juices and 
whatever seasonings are added.
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishtime1.html"><b>Baking Time Chart</b></a>
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishbake1.html"><b>Baked Fish</b></a>
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_mackstuff1.html"><b>Stuffed Baked Whole 
  Mackerel</b></a>
<p></p>

<h3>Broiling:</h3> &nbsp; Broiling is a fish cooking method that's 
fast, tasty, easy to clean up after and keeps the stove top clear for 
other uses. The downside is the amount of energy used and heating up the 
kitchen.
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishbroil1.html"><b>Broiling Method</b></a>
<p></p>

<h3>Deep Frying:</h3> &nbsp; For deep frying you need enough oil to 
submerge or nearly submerge the pieces of fish. The fish pieces (or whole 
small fish) are usually covered with some sort of batter in Western 
cooking, but may have none or just a light powdering of starch for Asian 
recipes.
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishfryd1.html"><b>Deep Fry Method</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Pan Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Pan frying requires only enough oil to keep 
the fish from sticking to the pan. Some fish pan fry fine with no coating 
but many require at least a light powdering of starch to keep from 
sticking, particularly if the skin is on, and some fish will fall apart 
if not coated.
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishfryp1.html"><b>Pan Fry Method</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Grilling:</h3> &nbsp; While probably the most disaster prone 
method for cooking fish, grilling has a fatal attraction for men. Here are 
some hints on how to keep it together.
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishgrill1.html"><b>Grilling Method</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Poaching:</h3> &nbsp; Poaching, cooking submerged in water just 
below a simmer, is an excellent way to cook any fish, particularly those 
of delicate flavor. 
<br><a href="../recipes/gmf_fishpoach1.html"><b>Method for Poaching Fish</b>
</a><p></p>

<h3>Steaming:</h3> &nbsp; Steaming is a popular method of cooking fish 
in Asia where home ovens were unknown until just recently and are still 
rare.

</a><p></p>
<br>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Fish are naturally very healthy and nutritious. In particular fish 
oils are the most effective source of Omega 3 fatty acids, thought by 
current medical knowledge to be effective against heart disease and 
clogged arteries. Some are, however, reluctant to recommend eating fish 
because of the concerns listed below.</p>

<h2 id="merc">Mercury</h2>

<p>In the 1960s hundreds of people in Japan were disabled and/or died from 
nervous system disorders acquired from nearly <u>daily</u> consumption of 
fish <u>heavily</u> <u>contaminated</u> with mercury. Mercury content 
was generally between 9 and 24 ppm (parts per million) with some as high 
as 40 ppm.</p>

<p>The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) set a maximum mercury 
content of 1 ppm for fish consumed in the United States, but admitted 
that level was purely a guess, and a conservative one. There was no 
reliable data on mercury exposure much lower than that experienced in 
Japan. This safety margin is very conservative, considering Americans 
don't eat fish every day. Certain large predatory fish (sharks, 
swordfish, largest tuna) can reach or exceed this level but most fish 
are far lower.</p>

<p>The FDA could not determine the level that might affect the nervous 
system of a developing fetus, but issued strong warnings for pregnant 
women to avoid certain types of fish. This lack of data has resulted in 
some studies.</p>

<p>A long term study by the University of Rochester and the Ministry of 
Health in the Seychelles islands has reported in. Pregnant women in 
the study ate an average of 10 times the amount of fish eaten by American 
women (there's not much else to eat there). Their children were well 
over 15 years old when the study concluded. Sponsors of the study were 
"shocked" (their word) to find no adverse affects whatever. Mercury 
levels for ocean fish are pretty uniform worldwide (except for a few 
spots with heavy industrial polution), so these results have broad 
application.</p>

<p>The FDA maintains a table of tested mercury content for a wide range of 
commercially important fish and shellfish (<a href="seafish.html#f02">F2</a>). Note 
that this table is for wild caught fish - farmed fish are unlikely to have 
a high mercury content due to type of feeding and short life. They have 
finally partially remedied the tilefish problem by separating Gulf of 
Mexico tilefish from low mercury Atlantic and Pacific tilefish.<p>

<p>Unfortunately, a whole industry has sprung up based on panicking 
people about "mercury in fish". While actual data supports that fish 
is safe to eat from a mercury standpoint, certainly in the amounts most 
Americans consume, there are now whole businesses and careers that 
thrive on the "mercury danger". How could certain "health product" 
promoters sell their expensive krill oil if you realized you could 
just go out an buy a mackerel?</p> 

<p>PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and other advocacy 
groups continue to present mercury proclamations, often tricked out with 
highly questionable or deceptively presented "scientific" data, to 
promote their own objectives - and their objectives may not be at all 
related to your health. One recent study by the Biodiversity Research 
Institute has been declared "Fraudulent" and scientifically unsupported 
by the National Fisheries Institute.</p>

<p>Given that the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has 
not registered a single case of mercury poisoning from fish, 
recommendations from the FDA and EPA (<a href="seafish.html#f10">F10</a>), 
the Rochester Study (<a href="seafish.html#f03">F3</a>) and general demographics of 
fish eating populations, it seems pretty conclusive that fish are safe 
to eat from a mercury standpoint. As of 2014, the FDA and EPA recommend 
<u>pregnant women eat more fish</u>.</p>

<p>Even more alarmist is GotMercury.org (<a href="seafish.html#f05">F5</a>) but 
their mercury panic campaign is actually a stealth cover for their core 
objective, which is stopping long line fishing - they, like PETA, are an 
"ends justify the means" group, and I simply don't think any 
organization dishonest about their data and objectives deserves 
credence.</p>

<h2 id="worm">Parasitic Worms <small>in</small> Sushi</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Anisakid Nematodes</h3> as a problem in sushi, particularly salmon 
sushi, have been widely discussed, sometimes in an alarmist and 
exaggerated way. In one case a 1-1/2 inch worm was reported as 10 inches 
long. Demographic information from populations that eat a lot of raw fish 
(Japan, Holland, Southern California) indicate it is a rare condition, 
but real, and can cause a lot of pain, often misdiagnosed as appendicitis. 
Even in these cases worms do not find humans a suitable host and die 
within 7 to 10 days. Most reported cases are from people who made sushi 
at home from wild caught salmon (farmed salmon is not likely to be 
infected).<p></p>

<h3>Tapeworms</h3> are a problem found in fresh water fish and salmon 
which live part of their life cycle in fresh water. Tapeworms can infest 
the human digestive tract for several years but are relatively easy to 
remove with medication if properly diagnosed. Eating fresh water fish 
raw is not recommended for this and other reasons.
<p>Japan's National Health Institute recommends freezing fish that will 
be used raw to -4&deg;F/-20&deg;C for several hours but this is lower 
than most home refrigerator freezer compartments will go, so commercially 
frozen fish is recommended. The U.S. FDA is more strict, recommending 
7 days at -4&deg;F/-20&deg;C or 15 hours at -31&deg;F/-35&deg;C. Cooking 
fish to an internal temperature of 140&deg;F/60&deg;C will kill all 
parasitic worms. Most fish cooking methods easily reach this temperature. 
See information from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife 
(<a href="seafish.html#f06">F6</a>) for more details.</p>

<h2 id="cigu">Ciguatera Poisoning</h2>

<p>Large predatory fish in tropical reef areas can be highly toxic. 
Eating them results in a range of frightening symptoms caused by damage 
to the nervous system. Treatment is difficult. Barracuda is the most 
common source of this poison but red snapper, grouper and others can be 
sources.</p> 
<p>A single-celled protozoan, Gambiendiscus toxicus, adheres to algae 
growing on coral reefs. Small fish that eat the algae become contaminated 
with ciguatoxin from these protozoans. Larger fish eat the small fish 
and are in turn eaten by large predators with the toxin becoming more 
concentrated at each step up the food chain.</p>
<p>Effective testing is seldom available for this toxin so fish cannot 
easily be certified safe if from a suspect region. This poisoning does 
not occur in non-tropical areas or far away from the reef environment. 
Barracuda taken off the U.S. Pacific coast are free of the toxin but 
Florida barracuda should not be eaten.</p>

<h2 id="hist">Histamine Poisoning</h2>

<p>Some fish, particularly family <i>Scombridae</i> (Mackerel and Tuna), 
if not properly handled, are subject to bacterial action resulting in 
production of histamines. An overload of histamines causes tingling of 
the lips and mouth, skin rashes, vomiting and other symptoms that may 
last for as long as 12 hours. In most cases it is not dangerous, but in 
the case of persons with allergy to bee and wasp stings it can be 
serious. Such persons should be careful about fish they eat and should 
carry anti-histamine tablets.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other Health Problems</h2>

<p>Some fish are just plain toxic and consuming them will kill you dead. 
Most famous is the puffer fish known as Fugu in Japan where it is a 
highly prized and hideously expensive delicacy. Fugu chefs are trained, 
licensed and regulated because one mistake made in preparing the fish 
can kill customers, and sometimes does.</p>
<p>As with Ciguatera Poisoning, the Fugu accumulate the toxins from 
their diet. It is easy to farm raise Fugu that is not toxic at all, 
but the Japanese have shown no interest in Fugu that does not carry 
the risk of death.</p>

<p>Fish from particular locations at particular times can be contaminated 
with bacteria or pollutants and be unsafe to eat. "Red tides" are 
particularly noted for this. Check the local government's Web site or 
with local fish and game authorities when catching fish in areas you are 
not familiar with.</p>
