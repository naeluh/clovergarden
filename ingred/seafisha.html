<h1>Fish Anatomy</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
We, and all the other mammals, reptiles amphibians and birds, are 
descended from a variety of fish very closely related to 
<i>Coelacanths</i> - unless you are a "Creationist" or "Intelligent 
Designer" - in which case God saved a lot of time designing you by 
simply kluging his successful fish design, resulting in some pretty 
funky engineering. So, in either case, what's inside a fish is pretty 
much the same as what's inside you - just arranged differently. 
<i>Coelacanths</i> were long thought extinct, but were rediscovered 
in 1938. They are characterized by four sturdy leg-like fins.  &nbsp;

<h2 id="length">Length of Fish</h2> 

<ul>
<li><b>Standard Length (SL):</b> &nbsp; This length is from the tip of 
the nose to the aft edge of the last vertebrae. This measure is used 
by many fish scientists because it eliminates the length of the Caudal 
Fin (Tail) which can be lunate (long pointy lobes) and may change shape 
as the fish ages.</li>
<li><b>Total Length (TL):</b> &nbsp;  This length is from the tip of the 
nose to the tip of the longest lobe of the Caudal Fin. If there is a long 
thread from the top lobe (some fish) it is ignored. This length is used 
by regulatory bodies when defining minimum catch sizes, etc. This is 
the length used on the Clovegarden site.</li>
<li><b>Fork Length (FL):</b> &nbsp; This length is from the tip of the 
nose to the aft edge of the Caudal Fin at its center. This measure is 
favored by some fish scientists as it gives a good measure of the 
appearance of the fish but compensates for deeply lunate tails and 
changes of tail shape with age.</li>
<li><b>Sharks &amp; Rays:</b> &nbsp; These are always measured as Total 
Length (TL) since the last vertebrae is deep within the tail.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="bony" class=lrg>Ray Finned Bony Fish</h2>

<p>This diagram is typical of ray finned bony fish, the vast majority of 
fish species, and almost all that appear in our fish markets. Ray finned 
fish appear in an incredible array of sizes and shapes, including eels, 
but are all made of the same components in the same general arrangement, 
just exaggerated in different ways. This diagram does not cover sharks 
and rays, which are not closely related. It also doesn't fit the bone 
structure of lobe finned fishes (our ancestors) which have arm and leg 
bones, but you are unlikely to encounter any of those.  &nbsp; <small>

<ul>
<li><b>Pectoral Fins</b> are not shown. These fins are right behind the 
  gill covers (<b>Opercula</b>) on most fish, but they may be lower.</li>
<li>The <b>Swim Bladder</b> does not appear in all fish.</li>
<li>The <b>Dorsal Fin</b> is comprised of two regions. To the front are 
  spiny rays, often very sharp. At the rear end are the soft rays. The 
  spiny and soft ray regions may be divided into separate fins.</li>
<li><b>Gill Rakers</b> are a comb-like structure on the inner edge of 
  each gill to prevent food from escaping through the gills.</li>
<li>The <b>Adipose Fin</b> appears on many fish. It is a small, fleshy, 
  rayless fin aft of the dorsal soft rays. Its purpose is still unknown.
  </li>
<li><b>Barbels</b> are long fleshy projections from the lower lip of 
  some fish, catfish for instance, which help locate food in sand 
  and mud.</li>
<li>Only Ostariophysian fish have the <b>Webearian Apparatus</b> 
  (Milkfish, Catfish, Piranhas, Carp). This device couples the swim 
  bladder to the inner ear, greatly enhancing hearing.</li>
<li>The <b>Skirt</b> is our term for the fleshy wall enclosing the 
  belly of the body cavity. It is not official, but convenient for 
  describing fish fillets.</li>
<li><b>Pinbones</b> is a culinary term for the sharp bones you must 
  pull out forward along the centerline, one for each rib. I haven't 
  found a scientific word for them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shark" class=lrg>Sharks <small>&amp;</small> Rays</h2>

<p>When the modern bony, ray fined fish (Teleostei) appeared, the older 
types were under great pressure due to being eaten by the new fish. One 
branch of the older fish responded by very rapidly evolving in two 
directions - adopting some characteristics of its own predecessors, but 
also evolving forward well beyond the Teleostei.</p>
<p>Advanced features include a bigger, more complex brain, allowing a 
much more sophisticated social structure, internal fertilization and live 
birth, and an array of very sensitive sensory organs for variations in 
water pressure, sight, smell and minute electrical charges. Some even 
developed a degree of warm bloodedness. So successful were these 
adaptations, the following era is called "The Age of Sharks", and it was 
the Teleostei who had to worry about getting eaten to extinction.

<br class=cll></p>

<ul>
<li>The shark <b>Skeleton</b> is not bony, but cartilaginous. This 
  relatively primitive structure is light weight, allowing sharks to 
  become quite large. They can also get along without a swim bladder, 
  enabling more vertical freedom in the water column. Actually, sharks 
  have negative buoyancy and their swimming is more like flying. If not 
  swimming or resting on the bottom, they will sink.</li>
<li>Shark <b>Scales</b> are actually teeth, very hard and difficult to 
  penetrate. Many cultures use shark skin for sandpaper and graters.</li>
<li>Shark <b>Teeth</b> are structured the same as their scales. They 
  are in several rows, and the front teeth are continuously replaced 
  over the life of the shark. Their teeth are shaped for ripping, not 
  chewing.</li>
<li>Shark <b>Blood</b> contains a large amount of urea so as to be in 
  osmotic balance with seawater, so most sharks can't survive in fresh 
  water, but some with modified kidneys can. When a shark dies, bacteria 
  degrade the urea into ammonia, so sharks must be well bled when caught, 
  and eaten or frozen in a short time. Do not buy shark or skate meat that 
  smells strongly of ammonia, it is not fresh.</li>
<li>Shark <b>Tails</b> are quite asymmetrical, because the spine curves 
  up into the top lobe, allowing powerful propulsion and high swimming 
  speed.</li>
<li><b>Rays</b> and <b>Skates</b> are sharks who's pectoral fins have 
  become so large they are like wings. These sharks are mostly, but not 
  entirely, bottom dwellers. Rays give live birth, while Skates lay 
  eggs. The giant Manta Rays are deep water filter feeders. Once feared, 
  scuba divers have shown them to be harmless and even friendly.</li>
<li><b>Temperature:</b> &nbsp; Most sharks are cold blooded, but some of 
  the most active predators can keep their body temperature above ambient 
  for more vigorous activity than cold blooded fish can manage.</li>
<li>Most sharks give <b>Live Birth</b> to fully developed young up to 
  2 feet long and able to fend for themselves. Some nourish their young 
  by placental attachment like mammals. Others use a different system 
  where some nourishment comes from the mother, but the first young to 
  hatch also eat unhatched eggs, and sometimes each other. This produces 
  few but relatively large well developed offspring.  Rays and some 
  smaller sharks have returned to producing eggs, generally in leathery 
  sacks.</li>
<li>Shark <b>Brains</b> are similar in size compared to body mass to 
  birds and some mammals. Most tend to be quite social, and display 
  curiosity and play behavior similar to birds and mammals.</li>
<li>The <b>Spiracle</b> is a special gill that feeds oxygen directly 
  to the eyes and brain. Teleostei fish do not have this feature, but 
  then they hardly have brains.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coela" class=lrg>Lobe Finned Fish</h2>

<p>In case you are curious as to what your remote ancestors looked like, 
here is one of their relatives that still lives today. Coelacanths 
date from about 400 million years ago, and were thought long extinct 
until science was shown living examples in 1938. Note that the pectoral 
and pelvic fin pairs are on stems, which contain the jointed bones which 
eventually developed into the arms and legs we enjoy today. These fin 
stems are anchored to well developed internal bone structures. Some 
species were quite lizard-like in shape, as is the related (and still 
living) Queensland Lungfish. Living lobe finned fish are noted for 
possessing either vestigial or functioning lungs. All in all, they are 
more closely related to amphibians, reptiles and mammals than they are 
to the ray finned bony fish.</p>
