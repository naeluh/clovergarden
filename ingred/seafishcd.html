<h1>Cleaning and Filleting Deep Bodied Fish</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; This page applies to deep bodied fish with a hard 
keel under the belly. Some deep bodied fish, like Tilapia, do not have 
the keel and our page <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and 
Filleting Round Fish</b></a> applies to them.

<p>Fillet or Filet? Both are used - fillet is the English version, and 
filet is the French from which fillet is derived. Living in California, 
I use fillet, and so does Wikipedia in the English version.

<p>Naturally, the right tools make a complex job like preparing fish much 
easier. In the photos to the left are all the tools I use for the job. 
You may already have some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kitchen Shears</b> &nbsp; These are for cutting through bones and 
  other tough stuff - an essential tool for every kitchen. The photo 
  example is Oxo.</li>
<li><b>Filleting Knife:</b> &nbsp; It is very difficult to deal with fish 
  without a razor sharp filleting knife. A boning knife can be used in 
  emergencies, but is not nearly as flexible.  The photo example is from 
  Finland - available in many sporting goods outlets.</li>
<li><b>Sharpening Stone:</b> &nbsp; Filleting knives need sharpening 
  often - and a knife sharpener would destroy your precious knife in 
  moments - the edge is at a shallower angle than regular knives. 
  Actually, I use a larger stone, but this small one fit in the picture 
  better. The stone must be very fine.</li>
<li><b>Long Nose Pliers:</b> &nbsp; These are essential for pulling 
  gills, pulling ribs from fillets and pulling small bones, as well as 
  the backbone from fish to be stuffed. They should be pretty sturdy. 
  I lubricate the joint in mine with silicone grease which doesn't 
  wash away. As long as they're washed and dried completely right after 
  use they will not rust.</li>
<li><b>Prep Knife:</b> &nbsp; Your standard cutting and chopping knife 
  for the more brutal cuts, will also serve for skinning fillets if 
  they're not wide. The backside, if strong and sharp edged, is also 
  excellent for scaling fish.</li>
<li><b>Slicing Knife:</b> &nbsp; This is an old style Turkey slicing 
  knife used for skinning fillets. The new style with straight edge and 
  round point is useless for skinning because it isn't stiff enough 
  to control.</li>
<li><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife</b> &nbsp; A razor sharp Cleaver Knife is 
  another essential every kitchen should have. With fish, it is used 
  for cutting across the backbone to make sections, cutting frozen 
  fish and fillets, and for splitting fish heads for soup stock. A 
  really good one can also be used for non-fish tasks, such as cutting 
  up pig feet and blocks of frozen foods.</li>
<li><b>Soft Faced Mallet</b> &nbsp; A nice hefty one is best. This is 
  used to drive the Cleaver Knife through after the edge has been placed 
  where you want the cut. Useful for many non-fish tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clean" class=lrg>Scaling <small>&amp;</small> Cleaning</h2>

<p>Here in Southern California, where Asian fish markets abound, any 
decent market will scale and clean the fish for you at no charge - 
but some fish sold at an unusually low price are marked, "not cut, no 
clean" - so it's up to you.</p>

<p>The main difference between a deep bodied fish is that you can't 
make a cut from vent to under the jaw because the whole bottom of the 
fish is a hard keel (though some deep fish, like Tilapia, have no 
keel and are treated the same as round fish).</p>

<p>For our example we'll use a <a href="sf_pompcz.html">Pompano 
</a> but any fish of this general shape will be pretty much the 
same.  On our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> 
page (very large page) there is a link to a "Prep and Cooking" page for 
each variety of fish. These pages have notes on the exact handling of 
particular fish.</p>

<h3>Important:</h3> when filleting fish you need to have your sharpening 
stone ready and know how to use it. Fish fillet knives get dull quickly 
because their razor edge is scraping along hard bones. If you find any 
reluctance slicing through skin, time to sharpen.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd01e.jpg" alt="Scaling" class=mrg>
First scale the fish. Not all fish have scales but kosher fish need 
at least a few. The pompano pictured has only a few small scales which are 
easy to scrape off without making a mess. Be particularly careful to 
remove all scales from along the fins and the collar because you're going 
to have to make cuts there.</p> 
<p>Pros use a fish scaling tool (concentric toothed rings) on some fish 
and a very coarse stainless steel scouring pad for others, but for home 
use the back of your kitchen knife will do fine. This is the messy part 
as scales will be flying about, so you might want to do the scaling 
outdoors.</p>
<p> Some fish are much harder to scale than others. In some cases you 
have to pull some of the scales off with needle nose pliers, in others 
you have to shave some of the scales off with the sharp edge of the 
knife. For one very soft fish I found a grapefruit spoon worked well.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><h3><u>ONLY IF</u></h3> you are going to cook the fish "head 
on, follow these next few steps for cleaning. If you aren't, just skip 
down to <a href="seafishcd.html#fillet"><b>Filleting</b></a> where we start by cutting 
off the head.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd21e.jpg" alt="Cutting the Fish Open" class=mrg>
Some deep bodied fish can be cut in the center like a round fish but many 
have a hard keel running almost the full length. For these you have to 
cut in from the side. Pick the best looking side and make the cut on the 
other side. The cut should start under the jaw and go no farther aft than 
the end of the body cavity.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd22e.jpg" alt="Pulling Out the Guts" class=mrg>
Now reach up into the fish and warp your fingers around the innards and 
pull them down and out. For some deep bodied fish the cavity is so short 
and high you'll only be able to get one or two fingers in there. If 
necessary use a spoon to assist.</p>
<p>You may need to go in with your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus 
which can be pretty tough on some fish.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd23e.jpg" alt="Pulling the Gills" class=mrg>
Next pull out the gill arches. For some deep bodied fish the gill slits 
are so small you can't get a good grip and need to cut the arches loose 
at both ends with kitchen shears. You may even have to use long nosed 
pliers to pull them out.</p>

<p>Above and behind the gills you will find the heart and other blood 
works. Scrape everything out and rinse with cold running water. You 
should end up with a nice clean empty fish. There should be nothing 
blocking the opening between the body cavity and the head, and the 
backbone should be exposed.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd25d.jpg" alt="An Empty Fish" class=mrg>
We now have a nice looking whole fish ready to cook. Turn the slit side down 
in the steamer or baking dish when you cook it.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="fillet" class=cll>Filleting</h2>

<p>We'll start over from the point right after scaling because most of 
the instructions above apply only if you're <u>NOT</u> going to fillet 
the fish.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd05e.jpg" alt="Severing the backbone" class=mrg>
First make the usual cuts around the collar to free the head. Tilt the 
knife in under the collar to get as much of the flesh as possible. Then 
use your kitchen shears to sever the backbone. You can go in from the 
top as shown or from the side if that is more convenient or would keep 
more flesh on the fillets.</p>

<p>Once the head is removed it'll be very easy to scrape all the innards 
out of the fully exposed body cavity (see instructions above). If you 
intend to use the head for soup stock it'll also be easy to cut the gills 
out of it. Just cut under the chin and hinge the collar back, remove the 
gills and scrape out all the other gooies.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd06e.jpg" alt="Making First Cuts" class=mrg>
Make a cut across the tail and then one up from the bottom on each side 
of the anal fin, all the way from the cut you made across the tail into 
the body cavity. This cut doesn't have to be real deep, but it does have 
to cut through the skin and a bit up the fin rays to free the fillet.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd08d.jpg" alt="Making the Back Cut" class=mrg>
Make a cut from the top to the backbone moving from head to tail. have the 
blade following against the fin rays until it can pick up the skeletal 
bones and follow those all the way to the backbone. Lead with the length 
of the blade rather than the tip because following the bones is easier 
that way.
<br class=cll><p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd10d.jpg" alt="Cutting Below the Backbone" class=mrg>
Cut the fillet free from the tail. Then from just behind the rib cage dip 
over the spine and cut cut downward until you meet the cut you already 
made from the bottom. This should have freed the fillet everywhere except 
the rib cage.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd13d.jpg" alt="Cutting the Ribs" class=mrg>
For some fish you can just follow the rib bones down but for many fish 
this is difficult to do without leaving a lot of flesh or accidentally 
cutting off the skirt. On some fish you don't care because the 
skirt is little more than skin but on other fish it's quite fleshy. I 
recommend just cutting the ribs away from the backbone and dealing with 
them after the fillet is removed from the fish.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd14d.jpg" alt="Removing Pin Bones from the Fillet" class=mrg>
Now you have a fillet separated from the fish. Use long nose pliers to 
pull out any remaining ribs. Start at the back and hold the flesh with a 
finger on each side of the rib as you pull it diagonally toward the top 
front.</p>
<p>Feel down the centerline and in most fish you'll feel a row of pin 
bones. These usually only need to be pulled for the first 1/3 of the fish 
because they get progressively softer. Use long nose pliers and pull them 
straight forward. This is too tedious for commercial operations, so they 
either use a "J" cut (wasteful) or a very precise "V" cut to remove the 
pin bones.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd27d.jpg" alt="Done" class=mrg>
Now you are ready to do the same on the other side. You should end up with  
two nice fillets and a fish with very little flesh left on it - a 
"see through" skeleton. Feel around one last time for any bones that 
have escaped, particularly along the cut where the head was. Pull any 
you find with the long nose pliers.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="skin" class=lrg>Skinning Fish</h2>

<p>With many fish you're going to want to skin the fillets, either 
because the skin shrinks badly and will curl or tear the fillets, or 
because it's a delicate flavored fish and the flavor of the skin is too 
strong. With a few fish you can practically just pull the skin off, but 
for most the skin is too delicate, adheres too well, or both.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; The example fish is fairly small, but if it 
is much wider, consider cutting it in half lengthwise at the centerline 
to make skinning easier.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd16d.jpg" alt="Starting cut" class=mrg>
You'll need a flat cutting board and a very sharp knife with a long 
straight blade. I find my 8 inch turkey slicing knife is excellent for this 
purpose. Our demo fish is the same Pompano used for the cleaning and 
fillet sections above.</p>

<p>Start skin side down with the fillet lined up along the edge of the board 
so the knife has flat access for the full length. Have the tail end just a 
little over the edge of your cutting board so you can bend it down and get a 
straight start with the knife blade. At this point you can see what you're 
doing and if you're down to the skin and not through it.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd17d.jpg" alt="Cutting" class=mrg>
Once you're started you're going to be running blind. The fillet isn't going 
to curl up as shown in the photo, that was done just to show you what is 
going on. Once you've started you can move your fingers up onto the board to 
get a better grip.</p>

<p>Holding the skin tightly to the board, keep the sharp edge of the blade 
turned just vaguely downward toward the skin and run it forward using just a 
tiny bit of sawing motion if you need to. Don't turn the blade too far down 
or you'll cut through the skin or at all up or you'll be taking flesh with 
the skin. When it's going just right the blade has sort of a sizzling sound 
and feel.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfd19d.jpg" alt="Skinned" class=mrg>
You should now have a skin with practically no flesh and a nice clean fillet 
with no skin. If your fillet has some of the silver inner lining of the skin 
on it, don't worry about it. If you've broken through the skin and have 
patches of whole skin on the fillet, they're going to be difficult to remove 
(use the tip of your filleting knife) so think hard whether you can tolerate 
a bit of skin before you try.</p>

<p>For some fish it's fine to toss the skins into the pot with the head, 
bones and fins for making fish stock for soups, chowders and stews. For 
other fish, the skin is too strong or bitter in flavor.  In Southeast 
Asia <a href="sf_snakehz.html">Snakehead</a> skins are sold separately 
for use in making soup stock. I tried it and wasn't that impressed.
