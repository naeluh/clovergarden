Fillet or Filet? Both are used - fillet is the English version, and 
filet is the French from which fillet is derived. Living in California, 
I use fillet, and so does Wikipedia in the English version.

<p>Naturally, the right tools make a complex job like preparing fish much 
easier. In the photos to the left are all the tools I use for the job. 
You may already have some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kitchen Shears</b> &nbsp; These are for cutting through bones and 
  other tough stuff - an essential tool for every kitchen. The photo 
  example is Oxo.</li>
<li><b>Filleting Knife:</b> &nbsp; It is very difficult to deal with fish 
  without a razor sharp filleting knife. A boning knife can be used in 
  emergencies, but is not nearly as flexible.  The photo example is from 
  Finland - available in many sporting goods outlets.</li>
<li><b>Sharpening Stone:</b> &nbsp; Filleting knives need sharpening 
  often - and a knife sharpener would destroy your precious knife in 
  moments - the edge is at a shallower angle than regular knives. 
  Actually, I use a larger stone, but this small one fit in the picture 
  better. The stone must be very fine.</li>
<li><b>Long Nose Pliers:</b> &nbsp; These are essential for pulling 
  gills, pulling ribs from fillets and pulling small bones, as well as 
  the backbone from fish to be stuffed. They should be pretty sturdy. 
  I lubricate the joint in mine with silicone grease which doesn't 
  wash away. As long as they're washed and dried completely right after 
  use they will not rust.</li>
<li><b>Prep Knife:</b> &nbsp; Your standard cutting and chopping knife 
  for the more brutal cuts, will also serve for skinning fillets if 
  they're not wide. The backside, if strong and sharp edged, is also 
  excellent for scaling fish.</li>
<li><b>Slicing Knife:</b> &nbsp; This is an old style Turkey slicing 
  knife used for skinning fillets. The new style with straight edge and 
  round point is useless for skinning because it isn't stiff enough 
  to control.</li>
<li><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife</b> &nbsp; A razor sharp Cleaver Knife is 
  another essential every kitchen should have. With fish, it is used 
  for cutting across the backbone to make sections, cutting frozen 
  fish and fillets, and for splitting fish heads for soup stock. A 
  really good one can also be used for non-fish tasks, such as cutting 
  up pig feet and blocks of frozen foods.</li>
<li><b>Soft Faced Mallet</b> &nbsp; A nice hefty one is best. This is 
  used to drive the Cleaver Knife through after the edge has been placed 
  where you want the cut. Useful for many non-fish tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clean" class=lrg>Scaling <small>&amp;</small> Cleaning</h2>

<p>Here in Southern California, where Asian fish markets abound, any 
decent market will scale and clean the fish for you at no charge - 
but some fish sold at an unusually low price are marked, "no cut, no 
clean" - so then it's up to you.</p>

<p>For our example we'll use a <a href="sf_petrz.html"><b>Petrale 
Sole</b></a> (actually a flounder) but any fish of this general shape 
will be pretty much the same.  Linked from our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
<b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page) you will find 
"Details and Cooking" pages for each variety of fish. Each of these have 
notes with detailed information about handling a particular fish. The 
photo specimen was 18-1/2 inches long and weighed 3 pounds 5-1/4 
ounces and yielded 1 pound 10-3/4 ounces of skin-on fillets (50%).</p>

<h3>Important:</h3> &nbsp; When filleting fish you need to have your 
sharpening stone ready and know how to use it. Fish fillet knives get 
dull quickly because their razor edge is scraping along hard bones. If 
you find any reluctance slicing through skin, time to sharpen.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale35d.jpg" alt="Scaling a Flat Fish" class=mrg>
First scale the fish (not all fish have scales, but all Flat Fish that I 
know of do). Pros use a fish scaling tool (concentric toothed rings) on 
some fish and a very coarse stainless steel scouring pad for others, but 
for a few fish the back of your prep knife (if it has sharp edges) will 
do fine. This is the messy part as scales will be flying about, so you 
might want to do the scaling outdoors.</p>
<p> Some fish are much harder to scale than others. In some cases you 
have to pull some of the scales off with long nose pliers, in others you 
have to shave some of the scales off with the sharp edge of the knife, and 
for Gray Sole, I found a grapefruit spoon worked well.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale36d.jpg" alt="Opening a Flat Fish" class=mrg>
Always cut in from the blind side. The cut will be short because of bone 
at each end, but needs to be wide enough to get your fingers in deep to 
pull the guts out.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale38d.jpg" alt="Pulling the Gills from a Flat Fish" class=mrg>
Pull the Gills out from both sides. This can be done before or after 
making the opening cut, but should be done before pulling the guts, as 
that can make it easier to pull them from some fish.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale40d.jpg" alt="Pulling Guts from a Flat Fish" class=mrg>
Now get your fingers up into the fish as far as you can, and pull the 
innards down and out. The esophagus will give the most resistance, but 
will be pullable.  Note that the body cavity goes far back in the fish, 
much farther than your cut. There's a bone keeping you from getting 
back in there, but everything there will pull out with the stuff from 
up front.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale42d.jpg" alt="An Empty Fish, with Removed Guts" class=mrg>
A cleaned fish, with the guts from one side. The other side will also 
have a long point coming from near the tail. There should now be a clear 
opening from under the gill covers into the interior. Pull out anything 
still there.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="fillet" class=lrg>Filleting</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale45d1.jpg" alt="Removing the Head from a Flat Fish" class=mrg>
Make cuts around the collar from both sides and remove the head. Note 
that the cuts go behind the pectoral fins and in front of the pelvic 
(bottom) fins. there may be bones behind the pectoral fins that you cut 
with your kitchen shears. Use you kitchen shears to sever the backbone. 
Bending the head will help if the backbone is quite strong. Cut the 
pelvic fins from the fish as they have bones under them and almost no 
flesh will be lost. 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale45d.jpg" alt="First Fillet Cuts" class=mrg>
Make a cut across the tail on both sides. Make another cut along the 
center of the fish all the way to the backbone. The backbone should be 
right under the lateral line where it is straight, but continue to cut 
straight forward when the lateral line curves upward.</p>
<p>Now outline your fillet with cuts along both top and bottom. The 
knife should be at a very shallow angle, following the fin rays, but 
need not be very deep, so long as it cuts through the skin.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale48d.jpg" alt="Back Fillet Cut on Flat Fish" class=mrg>
Eye side up, start from the backbone cut, make a cut toward the top of 
the fish, following the bones and fin rays all the way out until you 
meet the shallow cuts you made at the edge. Pull the fillet free from 
the skeleton.</p>
<p>Turn the fish and make the same filleting cut from the backbone to 
the bottom edge of the fish.</p> 
<p>Flip the fish blind side up and make the exact same cuts to free 
the fillets. Some Flat Fish will have a very thin blind side, but others 
will have substantial flesh on that side too - especially those that get 
tired of waiting in ambush and go hunting in mid-water like regular fish.
</p>


<p><img src="img/sf_petrale52d.jpg" alt="Set of Flat Fish Fillets Cut" class=mrg>
Now you have a set of fillets, a thick pair and a thin pair. These will 
have skin on them, which you may choose to remove or not, depending on 
your planned use and the nature of the skin. If it shrinks badly in 
cooking or has a bad taste, remove it, but I haven't found a Flat Fish 
with these problem.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale49d.jpg" alt="Flat Fish Skeleton" class=mrg>
You should have a nearly flesh free skeleton. Cut it up with kitchen 
shears and use it to make fish stock for your recipe.  For complete 
details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>. page.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_petrale53d.jpg" alt="Flat Fish Head Cut Apart" class=mrg>
The head goes into the stock pot with the fins and bones. It will work 
better if cut apart. First use you kitchen shears to cut the collar 
(the part with the fins) free at both ends on both sides. Then, on both 
sides, insert your shears into the mouth and cut straight back to 
remove the lower jaws (right and left sides in photo). Next, split the 
head in half from top down. The best way is with a sharp Chinese cleaver 
knife driven by a soft faced mallet. Rinse, removing any gooky stuff, 
and add to the pot with the skeleton.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="skin" class=lrg>Skinning Flat Fish</h2>

<p>Members of the Flounder Family have skin with little shrink and with 
no strong or offensive flavor, but sometimes you may wish to remove the 
skin anyway. If you do skin fillets, you can toss the skins into the 
stock pot with the head and bones. The fillet in the photos below is 
from a Striped Bass, but there is negligible difference between 
skinning that fillet and skinning a flat fish fillet.</p>

<p><b><u>Note</u>:</b> &nbsp; small flounders like Rex Sole and Gray Sole 
are almost never skinned. The skin is thin and fragile, but it's likely 
the only thing holding the delicate fillet together. Trying to skin one 
of these may not go well.</p>

<p><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_cfr33d.jpg" alt="Starting cut for Skinning" class=mrg>
You'll need a flat cutting board and a very sharp knife with a long 
straight blade. I find my old fashioned 8 inch turkey slicing knife is 
excellent for this purpose. The round end slicing knives now recommended 
by most food writers are too flexible to give you the control you need 
for skinning fish.</p>

<p>Start skin side down with the fillet lined up along the edge of the 
board so the knife has flat access for the full length. Have the tail end 
just a little over the edge of your cutting board so you can bend it down 
and get a straight start with the knife blade. At this point you can see 
what you're doing and that you're down to the skin and not through it.<br 
class=cll></p>

<p><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_cfr34d.jpg" alt="Midway in Skinning" class=mrg>
Once you're started you're going to be running blind. The fillet isn't 
going to curl up as shown in the photo, that was done just to show you 
what is going on. Once you're started you can move your fingers up onto 
the board to get a better grip.</p>

<p>Holding the skin tightly to the board, keep the sharp edge of the 
blade turned just vaguely downward toward the skin and run it forward 
using just a tiny bit of sawing motion if you need to. Don't turn the 
blade too far down or you'll cut through the skin or at all up or you'll 
be taking flesh with the skin. When it's going just right the blade has 
sort of a sizzling sound and feel.</p>

<p>If you accidentally cut through the skin, you can start again from 
the front tip of the fillet, trending somewhat downward.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_cfr35d.jpg" alt="Fillet and Skin Separated" class=mrg>
You should now have a skin with practically no flesh and a nice clean 
fillet with no skin. If your fillet has some of the silver inner lining 
of the skin on it, don't worry about it. If you've broken through the 
skin and have patches of whole skin on the fillet, they will be 
difficult to remove (use the point of your filleting knife) so think 
hard whether you can tolerate a bit of skin before you try.</p>

<p>For all the Flat Fish I've studied, it's fine to toss the skins into 
the pot with the head, bones and fins for making fish stock for soups, 
chowders, and stews.
