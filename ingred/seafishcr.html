<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; This page also applies to some deep bodied fish 
that do not have a hard keel under the belly, such as Tilapia. For fish 
with a hard keel, see our page <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/seafishcd.html"><b>Cleaning 
and Filleting Deep Bodied Fish</b></a>.

Fillet or Filet? Both are used - fillet is the English version, and 
filet is the French from which fillet is derived. Living in California, 
I use fillet, and so does Wikipedia in the English version.

<p>Naturally, the right tools make a complex job like preparing fish much 
easier. In the photos to the left are all the tools I use for the job. 
You may already have some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kitchen Shears</b> &nbsp; These are for cutting through bones and 
  other tough stuff - an essential tool for every kitchen. The photo 
  example is Oxo.</li>
<li><b>Filleting Knife:</b> &nbsp; It is very difficult to deal with fish 
  without a razor sharp filleting knife. A boning knife can be used in 
  emergencies, but is not nearly as flexible.  The photo example is from 
  Finland - available in many sporting goods outlets.</li>
<li><b>Sharpening Stone:</b> &nbsp; Filleting knives need sharpening 
  often - and a knife sharpener would destroy your precious knife in 
  moments - the edge is at a shallower angle than regular knives. 
  Actually, I use a larger stone, but this small one fit in the picture 
  better. The stone must be very fine.</li>
<li><b>Long Nose Pliers:</b> &nbsp; These are essential for pulling 
  gills, pulling ribs from fillets and pulling small bones, as well as 
  the backbone from fish to be stuffed. They should be pretty sturdy. 
  I lubricate the joint in mine with silicone grease which doesn't 
  wash away. As long as they're washed and dried completely right after 
  use they will not rust.</li>
<li><b>Prep Knife:</b> &nbsp; Your standard cutting and chopping knife 
  for the more brutal cuts, will also serve for skinning fillets if 
  they're not wide. The backside, if strong and sharp edged, is also 
  excellent for scaling fish.</li>
<li><b>Slicing Knife:</b> &nbsp; This is an old style Turkey slicing 
  knife used for skinning fillets. The new style with straight edge and 
  round point is useless for skinning because it isn't stiff enough 
  to control.</li>
<li><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife</b> &nbsp; A razor sharp Cleaver Knife is 
  another essential every kitchen should have. With fish, it is used 
  for cutting across the backbone to make sections, cutting frozen 
  fish and fillets, and for splitting fish heads for soup stock. A 
  really good one can also be used for non-fish tasks, such as cutting 
  up pig feet and blocks of frozen foods.</li>
<li><b>Soft Faced Mallet</b> &nbsp; A nice hefty one is best. This is 
  used to drive the Cleaver Knife through after the edge has been placed 
  where you want the cut. Useful for many non-fish tasks.</li>

<h2 id="clean" class=lrg>Scaling <small>&amp;</small> Cleaning</h2>

<p>Here in Southern California, where Asian fish markets abound, any 
decent market will scale and clean the fish for you at no charge - 
but some fish sold at an unusually low price are marked, "no cut, no 
clean" - so it's up to you.</p>

<p>For our example we'll use a <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_bassstz.html"><b>Striped 
Sea Bass</b></a> but any fish of this general shape will be pretty much 
the same, and even some fish, like tilapia, that are deeper bodied but 
do not have a hard keel.  Linked from our <a href="seafishv.html"><b>
Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page) you will find "Details 
and Cooking" pages for each variety of fish. These have notes with 
detailed information about handling each fish.</p>

<h3>Important:</h3> &nbsp; When filleting fish you need to have your 
sharpening stone ready and know how to use it. Fish fillet knives get 
dull quickly because their razor edge is scraping along hard bones. If 
you find any reluctance slicing through skin, time to sharpen.<p></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr02d.jpg" alt="Scaling a Fish" class=mrg>
First scale the fish (not all fish have scales, but all kosher ones have 
at least some). 
Pros use a fish scaling tool (concentric toothed rings) on some fish and 
a very coarse stainless steel scouring pad for others, but for a 
few fish the back of your kitchen knife will do fine. This is the messy 
part as scales will be flying about, so you might want to do the scaling 
outdoors.</p>
<p> Some fish are much harder to scale than others. In some cases you 
have to pull some of the scales off with long nose pliers, in others you 
have to shave some of the scales off with the sharp edge of the knife, and 
for one very soft fish, I found a grapefruit spoon worked well.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr03d.jpg" alt="Opening a Fish" class=mrg>
<img src="img/sf_cfr04d.jpg" alt="Cutting with Shears" class=mrg>
Next make a cut from the vent forward into the jaw. Make the cut shallow 
from the inside out because you don't want to cut into the innards. When 
you get to the bottom (pelvic) fins you'll meet resistance. Use you 
kitchen shears from that point forward.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr05d.jpg" alt="Pulling Guts from Fish" class=mrg>
Now reach up into the fish and warp your fingers around the innards and 
pull them down and out. For many fish they will all pull out easily but 
for others you will need to use your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus.</p>
<p>Scrape out anything left inside and break through the swim bladder (if 
present) so you can see the backbone. Note that many fish are going to be a 
whole lot messier than this very fresh bass.<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr10d.jpg" alt="Pulling Gills from Fish" class=mrg>
Next, unless you intend to simply discard the whole head, open the gill slots 
and pull out the gill arches. For some fish these are soft and pull out easily 
but for many you will have to cut them lose at the top and bottom ends 
with your kitchen shears and/or pull them out with pliers.</p>
<p>For most fish you can remove the gills through the gill slots but for 
some it's easier to go in through the gill slots and push them out 
through the bottom cavity,  and for a few fish your only access is by 
removing the bottom jaw.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr11d.jpg" alt="An Empty Fish" class=mrg>
Above and behind the gills you will find the heart and other blood works. 
There is always a "blood line" right below the backbone, and in many fish 
you have to remove the swim bladdar or tough membranes to get to it.</p>
 
<p>Scrape everything out and rinse with cold running water and you should have 
a nice clean empty fish. There should be nothing blocking the opening between 
the body cavity and the head and the backbone should be exposed.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="fillet" class=lrg>Filleting</h2>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> My instructions diverge significantly from most you'll 
find on the Internet. Most say to cut around the collar at the head end 
and then make a single cut from head to tail (or from tail to head) 
holding the knife crosswise to the fish.</p>
<p>It Seems to me the thickness of the backbone and other factors of 
geometry would cause quite a bit of flesh to be left behind, particularly 
on some of the more unusual fish and definitely for larger fish. The 
procedure I use works well for me on many different kinds of fish of many 
sizes, leaves very little flesh on the bones, and I believe it would be 
less disaster prone for persons new to filleting.</p>
<p>Some instructions have you fillet the fish before cleaning, and that 
can be a little easier with some fish, but since most of you will have 
your fishmonger scale and clean your fish we'll use a procedure that 
works both ways.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr13d.jpg" alt="First Fillet Cuts" class=mrg>
Make a cut across the tail on both sides. Make another cut through the 
skin from the tail cut down along each side of the anal fin to the body 
cavity. This cut doesn't have to be real deep, but it does have to cut 
through the skin to free the fillet.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr14d.jpg" alt="Fish Collar Fillet Cuts" class=mrg>
Make a deep cut all the way around the collar but as close to the collar 
as you can get. This will vary depending on the variety of fish.  For the 
top half of the cut keep your knife tilted well under the collar to get 
as much flesh as possible. You may encounter a rib or other bone you can 
cut through with your kitchen shears and deal with later. In the case of 
this striped bass the cut has to go behind the pelvic (bottom) fins, but 
for many fish they're farther aft and you can cut in front of them.</p>

<p>Note: For some fish, particularly those with a wide head and for small 
fish, I find it easier to fillet with the head removed. Just do the cuts 
around the collar on both sides and use your kitchen shears to sever the 
backbone as close to the head as you can (from the top for small fish, 
from inside the body cavity for larger). Actually, I can't think of any 
fish this wouldn't work for except when you want to cook it head-on - 
but then you wouldn't be filleting it.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr16d.jpg" alt="Back Fillet Cut" class=mrg>
Make a cut from the top to the backbone moving from head to tail. Have the 
blade following against the fin rays until it can pick up the skeletal 
bones and follow those all the way to the spine. Lead with the length of 
the blade rather than the tip because following the bones is easier that 
way. Make sure the head end of the filet is completely free from the head 
if you've left the head on.</p>
<p>Some fish are perverse enough to have no fin rays to follow and for 
others the fin rays stop before the skeletal bones start so you have to 
be careful not to get on the wrong side of the skeletal bones.
<br class=cll><p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr30d.jpg" alt="Tail Fillet Cut" class=mrg>
<img src="img/sf_cfr31d.jpg" alt="Cut ribs" class=mrg>
Now from just behind the ribcage to the tail end cut downward from the 
backbone until you meet the cut you already made from the bottom. This 
should have freed the fillet everywhere except the ribcage.</p>
<p>It's quite difficult on many fish to follow the ribs without leaving a 
lot of flesh or accidentally cutting off the skirt. On some fish 
you don't care because the skirt is little more than skin but on other 
fish it's quite fleshy. I recommend just cutting the ribs away from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and dealing with them after the fillet 
is removed from the fish. If you've removed the head you can cut in from 
the head end.<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr32d.jpg" alt="Fillet, Pulling Pin Bones" class=mrg>
Now you have a fillet separated from the fish. Use long nose pliers to 
pull out any remaining ribs. Start at the back and hold the flesh in 
place with a finger on each side of the rib as you pull it diagonally 
toward the top front.</p>
<p>Feel down the centerline and in most fish you'll feel a row of pin 
bones. These usually only need to be pulled for the first 1/3rd of the 
fish because they get progressively softer. Use the long nose pliers and 
<b>pull them straight forward</b>.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far too tedious for commercial operations, so they 
either use a "J" cut (wasteful) or a very precise "V" cut to remove the 
spines.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr22d.jpg" alt="Fish after Filleting" class=mrg>
Now you are ready to do the same on the other side. You should end up with  
two nice fillets and a fish with very little flesh left on it. Feel around 
one last time for any bones that have escaped, particularly along the cut 
where the head was. Pull any you find with the long nose pliers.</p>
<p>For a good filleting fish there should be no bones or spines left if 
you've been careful, but some fish aren't cooperative. See our special 
instruction for <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_milkz.html"><b>Deboning Milkfish</b></a> 
(Bangus). Carp (distantly related) has the same problem but it's 
nearly impossible to remove the spines, the diners just have to deal 
with them as they eat. Most of the world considers Carp some of the most 
delicious eating fish available, and easy to farm, but Americans have not 
learned to deal with the spines.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="skin" class=lrg>Skinning Fish</h2>

<p>With many fish you're going to want to skin the fillets, either 
because the skin shrinks badly and will curl or tear the fillets, or 
because it's a delicate flavored fish and the flavor of the skin is too 
strong. With a few fish you can practically just pull the skin off, but 
for most the skin is too delicate, adheres too well, or both.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr33d.jpg" alt="Starting cut for Skinning" class=mrg>
You'll need a flat cutting board and a very sharp knife with a long 
straight blade. I find my 8 inch turkey slicing knife is excellent for 
this purpose. Our demo fish is the same stripe bass used for the cleaning 
and fillet sections above.</p>

<p>Start skin side down with the fillet lined up along the edge of the 
board so the knife has flat access for the full length. Have the tail end 
just a little over the edge of your cutting board so you can bend it down 
and get a straight start with the knife blade. At this point you can see 
what you're doing and if you're down to the skin and not through it.<br 
class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr34d.jpg" alt="Midway in Skinningt" class=mrg>
Once you're started you're going to be running blind. The fillet isn't 
going to curl up as shown in the photo, that was done just to show you 
what is going on. Once you're started you can move your fingers up onto 
the board to get a better grip.</p>

<p>Holding the skin tightly to the board, keep the sharp edge of the 
blade turned just vaguely downward toward the skin and run it forward 
using just a tiny bit of sawing motion if you need to. Don't turn the 
blade too far down or you'll cut through the skin or at all up or you'll 
be taking flesh with the skin. When it's going just right the blade has 
sort of a sizzling sound and feel.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_cfr35d.jpg" alt="Fillet and Skin Separated" class=mrg>
You should now have a skin with practically no flesh and a nice clean 
fillet with no skin. If your fillet has some of the silver inner lining 
of the skin on it, don't worry about it. If you've broken through the 
skin and have patches of whole skin on the fillet, it's going to be 
difficult to remove (use the point of your filleting knife) so think 
hard whether you can tolerate a bit of skin before you try.</p>

<p>For some fish it's fine to toss the skins into the pot with the head, 
bones and fins for making fish stock for soups, chowders and stews. For 
other fish, the skin is too strong or bitter in flavor.  In Southeast 
Asia <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_snakehz.html">Snakehead</a> skins are sold separately 
for use in making soup stock. I tried it and wasn't that impressed.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="stuff" class=lrg>Preparing a Fish for Stuffing</h2>

<p>If you are going to stuff a fish, and particularly if you want to cut 
the stuffed fish into slices after it's cooked, you want to remove the 
backbone and ribs without disassembling the fish.</p>
<p><img src="img/sf_cfr37d.jpg" alt="Pulling our the Backbone" class=mrg>
First take your kitchen shears and cut the backbone as far back in the 
cavity as possible, then do the same as far forward as possible. Take a 
pair of pliers and firmly grasp the backbone at one end and pull outward.
</p>
<p>Watch carefully and you'll see places you need to hold with your 
fingers or cut with your filleting knife so flesh isn't ripped out. 
Sometimes it helps to cut the backbone in several places and sometimes 
you will need to cut the ribs from the backbone and then pull them 
separately to keep from tearing up your fish.</p>
<p>Explore the cavity with your fingers to find any remaining bones 
and remove them with long nose pliers. There's a lot more on this in 
our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com//recipes/gmf_mackstuff1.html"><b>Stuffed Baked 
Mackerel</b></a> which has a pictorial instruction section at the 
bottom.
<br class=cll></p>

<p>Another method of stuffing for fish that are quite round is to cut on 
each side of the dorsal fin and pull it out, then cut the spine at both 
ends from the top of the fish and and pull it out. finally clean the fish 
from the top leaving the belly intact. You place the cleaned fish in a 
normal swimming position and stuff from the top. I haven't tried this 
yet so I have no pictures.</p>
