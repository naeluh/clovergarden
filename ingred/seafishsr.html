<h1>Skinning Fish</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Some fish don't need to be skinned, but most will need skinning for 
at least some methods of cooking. The skin may shrink badly and curl 
fillets when cooked, or it may have a strong or "off" taste. Skinning fish 
does take a little practice to get right, and some are easier to skin than 
others, but a person with reasonable dexterity should be able to master 
it quickly.

<p>To successfully skin fish, you will need just a few simple tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Cutting Board:</h3> &nbsp; A flat one, and the thicker the better. 
  You need good access to the left edge (or right edge if you're left 
  handed) and unobstructed access across the front.</li>
<li><h3>Slicing Knife:</h3> &nbsp; This should be the "old fashioned" type 
  with a blade at least 8 inches long. The blunt end slicing knives now 
  recommended for slicing roasts are too flimsy to provide proper control 
  when skinning fish.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a few fish you can practically just pull the skin off, but for 
most the skin is too delicate, adheres too well, or both, so it has to be 
stripped off using a knife. The example here is a Cardinal Snapper.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_preps10f.jpg" alt="Starting cut" class=mrg>
Start skin side down with the fillet lined up along the edge of the board 
so the knife has flat access for the full length. Have the tail end just 
a little over the edge of your cutting board so you can bend it down and 
get a straight start with the knife blade. Work the edge so it's between 
the flesh and the skin.</p>

<p><u>Note</u>: For very wide fish you should cut the skirt (belly) area 
from the fillet and skin it separately. It is likely to not skin well 
attached to the fillet. For a very large fish you may need to split the 
fillet down the centerline seam.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_preps12f.jpg" alt="Continuing Cut" class=mrg>
Once you've got the cut started get a good grip on the tail end of the 
skin. Hold the knife at a shallow angle. This angle will vary with the 
fish, steeper for fish with tough skins and almost no angle for fish with 
delicate skins. The objective is to not cut into the skin but to leave 
almost no flesh on it.</p>

<p>Move the knife forward carefully holding the angle steady - run right 
off the big end of the fish. You can use just a little sawing motion but 
not much. If you've got it just right you'll hear a sort of sizzling 
sound and feel it in the knife. This is the skin pulling cleanly from 
the fillet.</p>
<p>If the skin breaks, which can happen for fish with a delicate skin, 
turn the fillet around and start again from the top front point working 
toward the tail and a bit downward toward the belly. This will usually 
get it all. 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_preps09f.jpg" alt="Skinned Fillet" class=mrg>
You should now have a skin with practically no flesh and a nice clean 
fillet with no skin. If your fillet has some patches of the silver inner 
lining of the skin on it, don't worry about it. If you've broken through 
the skin and have patches of whole skin on the fillet, they're not easy 
to remove (use the point of your filleting knife). In most cases a few 
patches will do no harm.</p>

<p>For some fish it's fine to toss the skins into the pot with the head, 
bones and fins for making fish stock for soups, chowders and stews. In 
fact, in Southeast Asia <a href="sf_snakehz.html">Snakehead</a> skins 
are sold separately for use in making soup stock. For fish with a strong 
tasting skin its best to just discard the skin.
