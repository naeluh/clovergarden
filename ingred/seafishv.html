<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>The varieties listed here are either of wide culinary interest or 
marketed in Southern California. Primary names are consistent 
with names used in the fish markets when correct, and with Fishbase when 
the markets are wrong (often). While you may not find your exact fish on 
this page, if you find the right family, cooking properties are probably 
similar. If you want more fish, Fishbase (<a href="seafishv.html#f2">F2</a>) lists 
over 34,100 varieties under over 324,100 common names - but they provide 
no culinary information at all.</p>
<p>Please consider the <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/">
<b>IUCN Red List</b></a> status when buying fish. In order of rising 
concern: <b>LC</b> = Least Concern, <b>NT</b> = Near Threatened, 
<b>VU</b> = Vulnerable, <b>EN</b> = Endangered, <b>CR</b> = Critically 
Endangered, <b>EW</b> = Extinct in the Wild, <b>EX</b> = Extinct. In 
addition there are <b>DD</b> = Data Deficient and <b>NE</b> = Not 
Evaluated. The 
<a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=32">
<b>Monterey Bay Aquarium</b></a> ratings are more complex, rating not only 
the sustainability of the species, but also the fishery's effect on other 
species as bycatch.</p>

[Aba, Aba Aba (Nigeria) ]
<p>
This fish is found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, usually 
not far from the coast. It can grow to over 7-1/2 feet long and 11 
pounds, but the photo specimen was a mere 34-1/2 inches long, weighing 
1 pound 3/4 ounce. This is a highly commercial fish, primarily for Asian 
markets, so it is very common here in Los Angeles, but it is also popular 
in Brazil, Portugal, Italy and Pakistan. Beltfish have no scales and 
make no effort whatever to be kosher.

A family of tiny fish that swim in large schools in temperate seas 
worldwide. They are very important to the fish food chain and also for 
production of fermented fish sauce, as essential to the cuisines of Southeast

[<i>Sphyraenus</i> species]
<p>
These very elongated fish are fearsome predators, with strong jaws and 
sharp teeth, but very rarely attacks swimmers. They are found mostly in 
tropical and subtropical seas. The photo is of a Pacific Barracuda 
(<i>Sphyraena argentea</i>) 42-1/2 inches long and weighing 8-1/3 pounds. 
This fish is found from Alaska to the southern tip of Baja California. 
Mexico, but is rare north of Point Conception in Southern California, 
It can grow to almost 60 inches and 26 pounds, but the Great Barracuda 
(<i>Sphyraena barracuda</i>) can get up to 72 inches and 100 pounds.
<br><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Barracuda can be 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/seafish.html#cigu"><b><u>highly</u> <u>toxic</u></b></a> in 
tropical reef areas like Florida, the Indian Ocean, Hawaii and northern 
Australia. Pacific Barracuda (<i>S. argentea</i>) is generally safe.

<p>
"Bass" is a popular name applied to many fish that aren't really bass, 
but people call them "Bass" anyway, particularly the Black Bass 
(Smallmouth and Largemouth) which are actually <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_sunfz.html">Sunfish</a>.

[Bullseye, Glasseye, family <i> Priacanthidae</i> 
(Bigeyes or catalufas)]
<p>
Bigeyes are a family of small tropical fish found all around the world, 
but most are concentrated in the Indo-West Pacific region, particularly 
in Indonesian waters. The photo specimen was labeled "Big Eye Snapper" in 
a large Asian market in Los Angeles, but I have identified it as 
Purple-Spotted Bigeye (<i>Priacanthus tayenus</i>). It can grow to almost 
14 inches but the photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches (not counting a 
thread extending from the tail) and weighed 3.5 ounces.

<p>
This fish which is found just about everywhere except in the Pacific 
Ocean can grow to 51 inches and 31 pounds but the photo specimen was 
16-1/4 inches and weighed 1.5 pounds. Considered a good eating fish 
it's highly commercial and now being farmed.

<br>

[<i>Albula vulpes</i>]
<p>
This fish is found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, but 
is now thought to actually be 8 species, all of which are visually 
identical. It is a prized game fish in a number of regions, particularly 
the Caribbean. It is, however, not a prized eating fish, so once caught, 
it is usually released. In the Bahamas, however, they are often split in 
half, spread with a sauce and baked for eating.

<h2>Bowfin</h2>
<br>
<img src="img/sf_bowfin01e.jpg" alt="Live Bowfin Fish" width="300" height="104"  class=mrg>
[Choupique (Creole French); <i>Amia calva</i>]
<p>
This fish is the only surviving species of a line that is sister to the 
modern fish (Telosts) but retains more features of their common ancestor. 
It inhabits the etire Mississippi River drainage system and many other 
rivers and lakes in the eastern half of the United States and southeastern 
Canada. It is able to breath air so can live in oxygen poor environments. 
This fish is most noted for its roe, which is processed and marketed as 
"Cajun caviar", or under the trade name "Choupiquet Royale". IUCN Red 
Listed LC (Least Concern).

[Pacific Bumper, Yellowtail Bumper, <i>Chloroscombrus orqueta</i> | 
Atlantic Bumper, <i>Chloroscombrus chrysurus</i>]
<p>
This fish is closely related to <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_scadz.html">Scad</a>, but while there are 
scads of scad there are only two bumpers - Pacific and Atlantic, and even those 
two may prove to be different varieties of the same species. The photo 
specimen is a Pacific Bumper  . Pacific Bumper can grow to nearly 12 inches 
but Atlantic Bumper can grow to 25 inches and supports a larger fishery.
Pacific Bumper are found in the Eastern Pacific from Los Angeles south to 
Peru. Atlantic Bumper is found in the West Atlantic from Massachusetts south 
to Uruguay.

[Koi (Japanese), family <i> Cyprinidae</i>, order <i>Cypriniformes</i>]
<p>
The modern Carp family has been around for about 55 million years and the 
carp order (<i>Cypriniforms</i>) since the Jurrassic 150 million years ago. 
They are not considered a prime eating fish in the U.S. but are very popular 
on the menu in Asia and in Europe, particularly Poland.</p>
<p>Coming in many brilliant colors and patterns and happy to live in 
small freshwater ponds, carp is the primary fish displayed in decorative 
gardens. Call a fancy carp "Koi" and it can sell for hundreds or even 
thousands of dollars. Unprotected ponds need big submerged pipes for them 
to sleep in because they are definitely on the menu for raccoons.

There are some 2200 species of catfish in as many as 40 families and many 
genera. The greatest number of species is found Central and South America 
(including one recently discovered in Mexico that may have been around since

Not actually a perch, this fish is a member of family <i>Anabantidae</i> 
(Climbing gouramies - a different family from <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_gourmz.html">
Gouramies</a> proper). It can grow to over 9 inches but the photo 
specimen was 5-1/2 inches and weighed 2.3 ounces. Able to tolerate 
extremely bad water conditions, it's an air breathing fish that can 
survive for weeks out of the water if it's kept damp. It can't actually 
climb trees though - individuals found in trees were probably left 
by birds. Most climbing gourami species live in Africa and are too small 
to eat, but this large one is found from India to China and considered a 
delicacy in Southeast Asia. It's both caught wild and farmed.

as juveniles and live there until time to spawn. Lacking scales in most 
cases and scales that can be scraped off without tearing the skin in all 
cases, eels are not kosher. The <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_eelz.html"><b>Eel

not members of the <i>Soleidae</i> family - probably because "sole"

they have been around for over 100 million years, and have retained many 
primitive features. They are very different from modern fish and can be 
found only in the rivers and estuaries of North and Central America, and 
the Caribbean.

size. Silvery John Dory is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated) but is

<p>Silvery John Dory is not a good swimer and catches it's prey by 
sneaking up on it. It then suddenly extends its mouth into a long 
tunnel and sucks the pray in. It is distinguished by a row of hard 
bony scutes from under from the head back to the anal spines, and 
hard bony bucklers, each with a thorn on it, for the full length 
of the base of the dorsal and anal fins.

<p>
This Indo-Pacific warm water fish is an important food fish in India, 
Southeast Asia and the Pacific, particularly the Philippines. Milkfish 
are extremely suspicious, strong and very fast so are difficult to catch 
in the wild but are a major farm fish in many tropical counties. While 
they can grow to almost 6 feet and over 30 pounds, farmed milkfish are 
generally marketed at 18 inches and smaller  The fish in the photo was 
18 inches and 2-1/4 pounds. The milkfish is durable, having survived 
the Cretaceous extinction that did in the dinosaurs, the ammonites and 
perhaps 50% of other marine species.

<p>
Monkfish is mostly a huge, ugly, inedible, bony head with a small tail 
sticking out the back side of it. This explains why you'll never see a whole 
monkfish in the fish market - only the tail is sold. The American Monkfish 
can grow to 47 inches and 57 pounds, the European to 78 inches and 127 pounds 
but these figures are meaningless since most of the fish is inedible. 
The European Monkfish is considered heavily over-fished though not yet on 
the official endangered lists. Monkfish is not kosher.

They are extremely long lived (to 150 years) slow breeding fish and even

American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi drainage basin and can

<p>Paddlefish are related to Sturgeon, and like sturgeon produce valuable 
caviar. This has traditionally been harvested from wild caught fish, but 
the success of California sturgeon farms has encouraged aquaculture 
development for both caviar and meat.

<p>
This fish is currently a darling of the fancy chef set, under the name 
"Black Cod". Sablefish is not at all related to real Cod, nor much 
of anything else - there's only one other fish in the entire 
<i>Anoplopomatidae</i> family. Sablefish are found off the North Pacific 
coast in deep water with sandy bottoms. They range from mid Baja California 
all the way around to mid China, though they're scarce south of Los Angeles 
and Korea. Most of the catch on this side of the Pacific is sold to Japan. 
This fish can grow to 47 inches and 125 pounds, but the photo specimen was 
19-3/4 inches and weighed 2 pounds 6-3/4 ounces, within the normal 
market size.

Salmon are large seagoing Trout. Actually all Trout are Salmonidae but 
we've broken out those not called Salmon to other headings (See 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_troutz.html"><b>Trout</b></a>) for a list.</p>
Salmon live most of their lives in the deep oceans but return to the 
river of their birth to spawn - and then die. Why they die I do not know, 
other fish of the same genus, even seagoing ones, survive spawning (so 
are called Trout). Atlantic salmon have a high mortality at spawning 
but some survive.

[class <i>Chondrichthyes</i> subclass <i>Elasmobranchii</i> superorder 
<i>Selachimorpha</i>]
<p>
Sharks are very different from other fish. When the modern fish (teleosts 
- bony fish) came on the scene, they rapidly pushed their predecessors 
toward extinction. Under severe stress some of these older fish back 
evolved features of their own primitive ancestors while adding some very 
advanced features as well. So successful were these adaptions the 
following era is called "The Age of Sharks", and modern fish had to 
struggle to survive. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="../photos.html#istock">i0089</a>.
</small></p>
<p>Sharks have much larger brains than modern fish and a more complex 
social structure. They generally give live birth instead of laying eggs 
and many are partially warm blooded and very energetic. They have no 
bones but a skeleton of light weight cartilage, allowing them to grow 
very large and still float. This light weight also allows them to 
dispense with a swim bladder, so they can sink or rise through the 
water column very quickly. Their scales are formed like teeth rather 
than the removable flakes on modern fish (thus shark is not kosher).</p>
<p>Many sharks are now IUCN Red Listed as VU (Vulnerable) due to slow 
birth rates and Chinese demand for shark fins. Finning sharks is illegal 
in US waters and posession of shark fins or shark fin products is now 
illegal in California and Hawaii, states with the largest Chinese 
communities. The

into the same paragraph, not from malice against biologists who support 
the "alternate" taxonomy. Some skates are listed as endangered (Common

The Pacific and Atlantic spadefish are difficult to tell apart, because 
both are so variable their characteristics overlap. I believe the photo 
specimen is Pacific, but am not certain. The Eastern Pacific is found 
from San Diego, California south to Peru, while the Atlantic is found in 
the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA south through the Gulf of 
Mexico and on to the far south of Brazil. The Atlantic can grow to 
36 inches and 20 pounds, while the Pacific can grow to 26 inches. The 
photo specimen was 13 inches and weighed 1 pound 13-1/4 ounces. The 
Atlantic is a minor commercial catch and some aquaculture. The 
Atlantic is IUCN listed NE (Not Evaluated) and the Pacific LC (Least 
Concern).

Spiny Eels are a separate order (<i>Synbranchiformes</i>) from eels proper 
and eels improper (<i>Anguilliformes</i>). There are a fair number 
of spiny eel species but this one, found in the rivers of Vietnam and 
Southeastern Thailand, is commercially significant (and a popular aquarium 
fish). Infesting freshwater rivers, streams, rice paddies and flooded forests 
they can grow to almost 12 inches but the photo specimen was 7.5 inches and 
weighed 1.1 ounces, the largest in a tray of frozen eels from Vietnam. 
The "spiny" part is tiny sharp stickers along the back and a couple on 
the bottom in front of the fins.
