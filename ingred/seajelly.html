<h1>Jellyfish</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Jellyfish (jellies in scientific literature) are in the Phylum 
<i>Cnidaria</i> along with Corals and Hydra. They have existed for 
between 500 and 700 million years. They start life much like a soft 
coral, as a polyp attached to a substrate, but when they reach a 
certain stage of maturity, they absorb their tentacles, and the stem 
casts off several disks, which become free swimming organisms called 
medusa. The stem may return to the polyp stage and later cast off 
more disks. Most medusas grow long tentacles with a great many toxic 
stinging cells. Many varieties can be painful, dangerous or deadly when 
encountered by humans.</p>
<p>A very few jellyfish are fished for human food, all from order 
<i>Rhizostomae</i>. These are larger, less toxic species. The Cannonball 
Jelly in the photo (top left) is an example. When disturbed, it exudes 
mucous containing a cardiac toxin that is also painful to the eyes. It 
does not sting, is not particularly dangerous, and can easily be 
cleaned up.

<p>Excess jellyfish can be disastrous to fisheries, because they
can wipe out fish eggs, recently hatched fish, and all the planktonic 
critters larger fish depend on for food. Large "blooms" of jellyfish 
are becoming more and more common, usually blamed on global warming 
and overfishing.

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Edible Jellyfish</h2>

<p>Below are the jellyfish most noted for being edible. This is not a 
complete list, but contains all the most popular. Dangerous and 
non-edible jellyfish have been omitted.</p>

<h2>Jelly Blubber</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_jellybb01k.jpg" alt="Live Blue Blubber Jellyfish" class=mrg>
[Blue Blubber; <i>Catostylus mosaicus</i>]
<p>
This is an Indo Pacific jellyfish which can be white, blue or brown 
in color, and can grow to a bell size of 18 inches diameter. It is very 
common along the east coast of Australia.

<h2>Sand Jellyfish</h2>

[Flame Jellyfish; <i>Catostylus mosaicus</i> also 
<i>Rhopilema hispidium</i>]
<p>
These are the jellyfish most eaten in Japan and China. They are native 
to the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.  The bell is thick and stiff, and 
can be as wide as 28 inches. Millions are now being pond reared to 1/2 
inch diameter. They are then released into fishing areas to grow out 
to commercial size.

<h2>Cannonball Jellyfish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_jellycb01c.jpg" alt="Live Cannonball Jellyfish" class=mrg>
[Jellyball; <i>Stomolophus meleagris</i>]
<p>
These jellyfish, growing to 10 inches across, are common along the 
Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New England to Brazil. They are 
also found along the Pacific coast from California to Ecuador, and in 
the Sea of Japan and the South China Sea. They are the third largest 
fishery in the state of Georgia, after shrimp and crabs, where they 
are processed and shipped to Japan, China and Thailand.

<h3>Namura's Jellyfish</h3>
<br><img src="img/sf_jellynm01k.jpg" alt="Live Namura's Jellyfish" class=mrg>
[<i>Nemopilema nomurai</i>]
<p>
This is a very large jellyfish, growing to a little over 6-1/2 feet 
across and 440 pounds. It inhabits the Sea of Japan and the East China 
Sea, and its numbers have increased until it is a serious pest to the 
fishing fleet. One trawler was capsized and sank while trying to retrieve 
its nets, which were full of jellyfish. Effort is under way to figure 
out how to use these critters as food. One company is making an ice 
cream with vanilla and Namura's Jellyfish.

<h2>Moon Jelly</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_jellyau02k.jpg" alt="Live Moon Jelly" class=mrg>
[Common Jellyfish, Saucer Jelly; <i>Aurelia aurita</i> and all other 
species in genus <i>Aurelia</i>]
<p>
These translucent jellyfish are found worldwide from near the Arctic 
south to the tip of South Africa, and can grow to 16 inches in bell 
diameter. They do sting, but not strongly or dangerously. Moon Jellies 
are found near the shore, where they mostly just drift around, because 
they are very poor swimmers. They are edible, but I haven't found any 
evidence they are used commercially. Commercial processors prefer 
jellyfish with thicker, firmer bells. There are several reports from 
people who have eaten Moon Jellies fresh, and have reported them tasty 
with a little lime juice or dip. They must be eaten very soon after 
catching or they liquify and get smelly.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Exposure to live jellyfish can range from annoying to very painful 
to deadly, and is best avoided. Rubbing affected areas with vinegar or 
salt water is useful, and scraping the affected area with a safety razor, 
knife blade, credit card or other sharp edged item can remove unfired 
nematocysts to help reduce pain. Fresh water, alcohol and urine are to 
be avoided as they may cause more of the nematocysts to fire their toxic 
darts. Nematocists are mostly triggered by contact with skin chemicals, 
and they are minute, so even panty hose holds them far enough away to 
provide protection.</p>

<p>Commercially prepared jellyfish is safe, because the toxic parts and 
materials have all been removed. Some are concerned over the possibility 
of residual aluminum from treatment with alum, which is used by some 
processors to firm up the product.</p>

<p>"Dried" jellyfish is still about about 90% water, with about 8% 
protein, almost all of which is collagen. The other 2% consists of 
a tiny bit of fat, minerals and other substances. Jellyfish is very 
low in calories.</p>

<p>Jellyfish collagen is prepared from dried jellyfish, packaged in 
capsules and used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. This 
treatment is still experimental and not yet recognized by the FDA.
