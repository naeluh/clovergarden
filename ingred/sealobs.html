In the state of Maine "Lobster" can mean only one thing (though the rest 
of the world may disagree). In the early days of the Republic, though, 
these overgrown crayfish were considered food for the poor, shunned at 
fine tables. After storms the rough folk would go down to the shore and 
carry off stranded lobsters weighing 10 to 20 pounds - for the taking, so 
it couldn't be very good.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>Then railroads were built and refrigerated freight cars were built. 
Live lobsters could be sent to Chicago and other inland cities where they 
were exotic, expensive, and in great demand. Prices soared, and the good 
people of Maine began to realize their error.</span> &nbsp; <small>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General &amp; History</h2>

<p>The category "Lobster" includes several crustacean families that are 
not necessarily closely related. True lobsters have large claws. Crayfish 
are closely related to true lobsters. Spiny lobsters, which have no claws 
but very strong jaws, are related only as members of the order 
<i>Decapoda</i>, which makes them as distantly related as crabs. Spiny 
lobsters are warm water creatures while true lobsters reach their maximum 
development in the cold waters of the North Atlantic off the coast of 
New England (U.S.) and Canada. All the "lobsters" listed here (and some 
that aren't) are considered highly desirable food items.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Buying, Cleaning &amp; Cooking Lobsters</h2>

<p>This section will be expanded as time permits, and moved to a separate 
page, but right now, we treat only the controversial issue of killing 
lobsters.</p> 

<h2 id="kill">Killing Lobsters</h2>

<p>If you've bought your lobster live you have to kill it before you can 
eat it. Dying is never a pleasant experience, not for us or for lobsters, 
so you want to kill it as cleanly and quickly as possible. The question 
of whether "lobsters don't feel pain like we do" is still unresolved with 
conflicting experimental data, but we should presume they do. There are 
several methods used.</p>
<ul>
<li>The traditional method is by dumping the lobster face first into a big 
pot of boiling water. Some consider this cruel and say the lobsters scream. 
Looking at it logically, the lobster's main brain is right behind the eyes, 
so there may or may not be a moment of pain, but the brain should be 
cooked in less than a second and the pain forgotten. The "scream" is 
actually air exiting from under the shell due to the temperature change. 
The body may still twitch for a few seconds, but there's no lobster in 
there anymore.<p></p></li>
<li>Set a knife lengthwise over the front of the head and hit it down with 
a soft faced mallet splitting the front of the head and the brain. This 
should produce an almost instant loss of consciousness, but the body may 
still react for a minute or more. You see, the lobster has a distributed 
brain, so parts are still functional even though the main center of 
perception is gone.<p></p></li>
<li>Some feel the lobster should be sedated by stashing in the freezer for 
twenty minutes to an hour or more before dropping in the boiling water. 
This may or may not be effective. Personally, I'd not be too pleased at 
being slowly frozen alive.<p></p></li>
<li>Others feel the lobster should be sedated by soaking in a salt solution 
before dropping in the boiling water. Having observed crabs react to water 
of the wrong salinity, I'm not going to recommend this without more 
evidence, it may be very painful to the lobster.</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="true">True Lobsters</h2>

<p>True lobsters (family <i>Nephropidae</i>), also known as clawed 
lobsters, exist in all seas and to a depth of over 11,000 feet. There 
are at least 19 genera. Most are small, and only a few species are 
harvested commercially.</p>

<table>

   <h2>American Lobster</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_lobsta01e.jpg" alt="Live American Lobster" class=mrg>
   [Maine Lobster, Northern Lobster, <i>Homarus americanus</i>]
   <p>
   These true lobsters are found as far south as North Carolina but achieve 
   their maximum numbers and development from the US state of Maine to 
   Labrador, Canada. They can grow as large as 44 pounds and over 3 feet 
   long but the average market size is between 1.5 and 2 pounds. Lobsters 
   are brown to greenish but about 1 in a million is bright blue and about 
   one in 30 million is yellow. A very few are albinos, which don't turn 
   red when cooked as the others do.</p>
   <p>These lobsters are of considerable medical interest because they 
   apparently can live practically forever if not killed by predators. 
   They have the ability to repair their own DNA so they do not age.</p>
   <p>The American Lobster has been over-fished. Aquaculture has not been 
   successful because lobsters grow slowly and because in a crowded 
   artificial environment they tend to cannibalism.

   <br><img src="img/sf_lobseu01h.jpg" alt="Live European Lobster" class=mrg>
   [Common Lobster; <i>Homarus gammarus</i>]
   <p>
   These true lobsters are found in the East Atlantic, from Norway to 
   Morocco, and in the Mediterranean west of Cyprus, and on the north 
   coast of the Black Sea. They are closely related to the American 
   lobster. These lobsters are normally blue and can grow to about 24 
   inches body length and around 12 pounds, but commercially range from 
   9 to 15 inches and 1-1/2 to 5 pounds.	Conservation status is LC 
   (Least Concern).   &nbsp; <small>Photo by H.Zell distributed under

   <p>
   These true lobsters are found in the Northeast Atlantic, from Iceland 
   to Norway and down through the North Sea to Portugal. There is also 
   a population in the North Adriatic Sea between Italy and Greece.
   They are the most important crustacean catch in European waters.</p>
   <p>They are quite small, growing to about 8 inches long, including 
   the tail and their very elongated claws. Conservation status is LC 
   (Least Concern). Very similar and closely related species of genus 
   <i>Metanephrops</i> are fished around New Zealand and Japan. &nbsp;

<p>[Langouste, Rock Lobster; Crayfish (Australia); family 
  <i>Palinuridae</i>, genus <i>Palinurus</i> (Mediterranean), 
  <i>Panulirus</i> (Americas, Australia &amp; China)] </p>

<p>Spiny Lobsters are no closer related to true lobsters than crabs 
are. Unlike true lobsters, they have no claws but very strong jaws 
and a lot of protective spines. Found worldwide in both hemispheres they 
prefer warmer waters and are generally nocturnal. The Australians, who 
tend to get everything upside down and backwards, call them Crayfish. 
Spiny lobsters have been around since the Cretaceous, about 110 million 
years ago.</p>

   <p>[Crayfish (Australia); <i>Panulirus cygnus</i>]
   </p><p>
   Native to the West Coast of Australia, this lobster accounts for the 
   most valuable fishery in Australia with somewhere around 10,000 tons 
   landed per year. It is a large lobster with the largest recorded 
   weighing 15 pounds, but they are normally much smaller than that. 
   Conservation status is LC (least concern) and the highly regulated 
   fishery is certified as sustainable.

   </p><p>
   Found from Monterey Bay, California to the tip of Baja California, 
   these lobster have no claws, but jaws strong enough to crush clams. 
   They can grow to 3 feet long and the official weight record is 16 
   pounds, but specimens to 26 pounds have been reported unofficially. 
   The fishery is quite efficient so few make it beyond 2 pounds today. 
   It is also a highly regulated fishery and considered sustainable.

   This lobster is found in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, 
   Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, from North Carolina to Reo de Janeiro, 
   Brazil. They can grow up to 16 pounds. Most are caught in the Florida 
   keys, but other areas of the Caribbean also harvest them, 
   particularly the Bahamas.  Conservation status is DD (Data Deficient) 
   but the fishery is tightly regulated in Florida waters.

<h2 id="slipper">Slipper Lobsters</h2>
[Mitten Lobster; Family <i>Scyllaridae</i>]
<p>
These relatives of the Spiny Lobsters are found in warmer waters 
the world around. They are generally nocturnal, clinging to the underside 
of ledges and caves during the day and coming out at night to eat mollusks, 
crustaceans and sometimes sea urchins. Slipper Lobsters are characterized 
by their main antennae being enlarged and flattened into a shield shape. 
There are currently 22 recognized genera, but only the 4 most popular 
for eating are listed here.</p>

   <i>Scyllarides latus</i>]
   </p><p>
   Both of these very similar lobsters grow to about 12 inches long and 
   are very much favored as food. The Mediterranean ranges into the warmer 
   parts of the eastern Atlantic, while the West Atlantic ranges from 
   South Carolina through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to 
   S&atilde;o Paulo Brazil. It is particularly popular in Brazil where 
   it is called Cavaquinha (ukelele-lady). The Mediterranean has been 
   seriously overfished and is no longer common in most of its range. 
   the West Atlantic is rated "Least Concern". A Brazilian expert says 
   the way to select these is to press the underside of the tail. If it 
   is too springy it isn't meaty enough. The photo is <i>Scyllarides 
   Latus</i>.

   These lobsters, though of different genus, are often confused and look 
   much alike. The Balmain supports the largest fishery but lives only 
   around northeastern Australia, while the Moreton Bay is found across 
   the Indo Pacific region and is particularly popular in Singapore. The 
   Moreton bay is preferred to the Balmain in Australia as the later is 
   said to sometimes taste faintly of garlic. Both can grow to as much 
   as 9 inches long but are usually shorter. The photo specimen is a 
   cooked Moreton Bay Bug. &nbsp;

   to northern Brazil, the southern coast of Africa and the Indian 
   Ocean, as well as Hawaii and Polynesia. The Japanese just lives around 
   Japan.  All species of <i>Parribacus</i> are used locally as food and

<i>Cambaridae</i> (American South, East Asia) | <i>Astacidae</i> 
(Eurasia, Western North America) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Parastacidae</i> 
(South America, Madagascar, Australasia)]
<p>
Crayfish are freshwater lobsters, closely related to the true lobsters, 
but generally much smaller than ocean lobsters. The photo specimens 
(pre-cooked and frozen) were farm raised in China, the larger being 
3-1/2 inches long from nose tip to tail tip and weighing 0.7 ounces. 
The whole tray of 19 of them weighed 11.1 ounces for 0.58 ounces each 
and the whole 19 yielded 1.7 ounces of tail meat (15%). Nothing else 
edible was found on these critters. Considering the tray cost US $2.25, 
that's $21 per edible pound. Live crayfish are now fairly common in some of 
the larger Asian markets here in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Legend has it that when the French were forced out of Canada by the 
British, they took lobsters along on their long trek - but as they 
went south the lobsters kept getting smaller and smaller, until by time 
they got to Louisiana they were crayfish.

[Squat Lobster; family <i>Galatheidae</i>. Species <i>Cervimunida 
johni</i>, <i>Pleuroncodes monodon</i> and <i>Munida gregaria</i>]
<p>
The name "Langostino" means different things in different parts of the 
world. In the United States, the FDA allows it to be used for the three 
species of Squat Lobsters listed above. Squat Lobsters are rather small, 
with a body length of between 2 and 5 inches, but they keep their tail 
tightly tucked under their abdomen. Nearly all fishing activity is on 
the west coast of Central and South America.</p> 
<p>These are not actually lobsters, but a kind of crab, related to 
hermit crabs, but we list them here because they are always called "Squat 
Lobsters". The meat of these critters is used mainly by restaurants, 
and there has been some controversy over naming of what's in the 
finished dish.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Lobster is low in fat and high in protein, but, like other crustaceans 
it is moderately high in cholesterol. When the AHA (American Heart 
Association) was running their big scare on cholesterol we were told 
to avoid shrimp and lobster. As usual, this was based on incomplete 
and defective studies. Most cholesterol is manufactured within the body 
(and the body needs quite a bit of it - your brain is very high in 
cholesterol, and it is required in cell membranes and other very 
important locations).</p>
<p>If you get a little more dietary cholesterol, the body manufactures 
less of its own. There are, however, some people who are sensitive to 
dietary cholesterol - so you should know if that applies to you.</p>
<p>Mercury content of lobster is comparable to low mercury fish, about 
0.31 parts per million. As the Seychelles Study (<a href="sealobs.html#l03">L3</a>) 
found, the mercury content of fish is not much of a problem, even for 
pregnant women and developing children, so lobster is not a mercury 
worry. You won't hear much about the Seychelles Study, because by this 
time so many careers and product pitches depend on the mercury scare.
