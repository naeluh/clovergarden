<h1>Octopus</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>[Octopus; Pulpo (Spanish); Tako (Japan); Order <i>Octopoda</i>]
</p><p>
Octopi are an order of large mollusks that have evolved entirely out 
of their shell. They are related to squid, cuttlefish, the nautilus 
(which still has it's shell) and the extinct ammonites only at the Class 
level - each of these is in it's own Order. These mollusks are no snails. 
They are very intelligent, strong and can move quickly, as a recent 
video of an octopus capturing a shark for lunch shows.

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Octopus has always been a favorite seafood in Italy, Greece and Japan 
but is known most to Americans as slices of tentacle on top of sushi 
rice.</p>
<p>Octopi like to hide which makes them fairly easy to catch. Clay jars 
are dropped on the sea floor to become octopus hiding "caves", then are 
pulled up with their occupant inside.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="buy" class=lrg>Buying Octopus</h2>

<p>Octopus is not marketed by variety, at least not around here, only by 
size. The sizes most common in Southern California markets are "large", 
about 2 to 4 pounds and "baby" which may range from 0.1 ounce to 3 ounces.
</p>
<p>Octopi around 4 pounds are also sold pre-cooked, generally cut to the 
weight you order. Uncooked, all sizes are usually sold with the head on 
but with innards, eyes and beak removed. The "baby" are sold by bulk 
weight, usually out of a pan where they are mixed with ice to keep them 
chilled. The larger are tightly bagged in transparent plastic, displayed 
head side down, and may be still frozen.</p>
<p>It is better to buy octopus that has been frozen because the freezing 
tenderizes them some and they will cook faster.</p>
<p>While every bit of the octopus you buy is edible, it looses a lot of 
water when it cooks and will shrink very significantly. While "baby" 
octopi may yield over 40% of their original weight, large octopi will 
yield about 30%, or if you cook long enough and rub off the skin and 
sucker disks  it'll be more like 20%.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cleaning <small>&amp;</small> Cooking</h2>

<p>Since Octopus is generally sold "cleaned" (beak, eyes and innards 
removed) there's no cleaning required and yield is just about 100% - 
<i>of the solids</i>. You're going to take a huge hit on weight because 
so much of an octopus is water and that gets squeezed out in the first 
few minutes of cooking. See the separate sub-articles for details on 
cooking octopi of different sizes.</p>

   <h2>Cooking Small Octopus</h2>
   <br><a href="sf_octosmz.html">
   <img src="img/sf_octo23h.jpg" alt="Small Octopi" class=mrg></a>
   The octopi shown here range from 0.5 ounces with a tentacle span of 6 
   inches to 2.8 ounces with a tentacle span of 11 inches. They are sold 
   as "Baby Octopus" in Southern California with most between 1 and 2 
   ounces.
   <p>Small octopi cook in less than 1/2 hour and are very good used in 
   salads, soups and appetizers. Yield is much better than for large 
   octopi.

   <h2>Cooking Large Octopus</h2>
   <br><a href="sf_octolgz.html">
   <img src="img/sf_octo26h.jpg" alt="Large Octopus" class=mrg></a>
   Large octopus in Southern California markets range from about 1-1/2 
   pounds to 4-1/2 pounds - but when buying remember that it shrinks a 
   great deal when cooked.
   <p>The photo specimen weighted 2.2 pounds at purchase with a tentacle 
   span of about 59 inches, but by time I finished photographing it so 
   much water had drained out it was down to 1.8 pounds. It continued to 
   drain overnight in the fridge and was down to 1.5 pounds in the 
   morning. By time it was cooked long enough to eat (about 1-1/2 hours) 
   it was down to 10 ounces.
   &nbsp; <a href="sf_octolgz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Very Large Octopus</h2>
   <br>These would be octopi larger than 5 pounds. In Mediterranean 
   cookbooks you'll find instructions for pounding these octopi or 
   flogging a rock with them to tenderize. I have not been able to 
   verify if that is really necessary because octopus weighing much 
   over 4 pounds is not commonly available in Southern California 
   markets.<p></p>

   <h2>Sushi Octopus</h2>
   <br>Octopus for sushi is generally purchased pre-cooked and frozen 
   from a supplier in Japan.<p></p>

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Octopus gets an "A" grade for nutrition: very low fat, high in niacin, 
phosphorus, potassium, vitamin B6 and zinc; very high in iron, selenium and 
vitamin B12. The only negatives are sodium and cholesterol. Since it's been 
found very few people absorb significant cholesterol from food (it's 
manufactured within the body) this last is not a particularly serious 
point.</p>
