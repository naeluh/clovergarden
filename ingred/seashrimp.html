<span class=bg>Shrimp are found worldwide in coastal waters, salt, 
brackish, and fresh. They are now a major aquacultural product which has 
kept the cost of this prized seafood within reason. It would be even more 
reasonable if not for intensive political lobbying by the antiquated 
and very wasteful shrimp fishing industry.</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General Discussion</h2>

<p>Shrimp and Prawns are Crustaceans, a branch of the Arthropods (insects 
and spiders are other branches). Specifically, they belong to the 
<i>Malacostraca</i> branch of crustaceans which also includes crabs, 
lobsters and sow bugs, the only common land living shrimp. This page 
views shrimp <i>senso lato</i>, including all free swimming shrimp-like 
<i>Malacostraca</i> and <i>Branchiopoda</i>.</p>

<h3>Shrimp or Prawn?</h3> &nbsp; To quote a frustrated 
seafood industry expert, "No one on Earth knows the difference". 
Some biologists claim to, but they tell them apart by obscure details 
of shell plate overlap, not helpful to consumers. Actually there is 
no scientifically accepted definition of either "shrimp" or "prawn".
<p></p>

<p>Fortunately, in the U.S. "Prawn" has fallen out of use - everything's 
a shrimp: colossal, jumbo, large or medium, fresh water or salt. You 
still find "prawn" called for in many cookbooks, particularly British 
cookbooks, where the word "Prawn" seems to have taken on the same broad 
meaning that "Shrimp" has in North America.</p>

<p>An Australian site claims they get it right (biologically) down 
there, but in the rest of the world, prawns are big and shrimp are 
small, or shrimp are big and prawns are small. The United Nations FAO 
(Food and Agriculture Organization) has given up on a scientific 
definition and assign "prawn" if it comes from fresh water and "shrimp" 
if it comes from salt water, and that usage seems to be spreading. 
Actual fresh water prawns are much more perishable than shrimp, so are 
not nearly as common in the markets as shrimp labeled as "prawns".</p>

<h3>Sizes:</h3> &nbsp; We have a convenient size table on our 
<a href="seashrimpw.html#size"><b>Working with Shrimp and Prawns</b></a> 
page.<p></p>

<h3>Wild or Farmed?</h3> &nbsp;  Most shrimp on the market 
today are farm raised, some domestically but a lot from Southeast Asia 
and South and Central America. There has been plenty of criticism of the 
ecological impact, some of it grossly exaggerated, especially in regard 
to impact on mangroves. Stopping shrimp farming is not the answer - 
improving it is. Governments and growers are working on improvements, 
particularly in setting up recirculating shrimp ponds inland from the 
oceans. Some of these recirculating plans run the flow from the shrimp 
ponds through rice paddies and back. There are other serious problems 
being worked on, particularly diseases. In 2014, shrimp became quite 
expensive because many farms were hit by a mysterious disease reducing 
total production. This disease hit Thailand, the largest producer in 
2013.<p></p>

<p>That disease wiped one of my technology consulting clients. They  
had a big shrimp breeding operation in Hawaii. One of the former 
employees, working with new owners under the name Sunrise Capital, is 
now a pioneer in closed system development.  Once widespread in 
Southeast Asia and South and Central America, the system of destroying 
mangrove forests for shrimp ponds has basically failed. Those ponds 
quickly degrade, are impossible to protect from disease, and once 
infected are impossible to recover. Thailand and the United States 
are leaders in developing closed system shrimp farming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the wild shrimp fishery has been <b><u>incredibly 
wasteful</u></b>. Pictorial articles I've seen show shrimp fishermen 
sorting out the catch on deck. Less than 20% is shrimp and the rest is 
fish that <u>die flopping on the deck</u> only to be dumped overboard. 
My assistant, T, was once invited out on a shrimp boat. She spent the 
night tossing dying fish back into the water while the shrimpers 
laughed at her.<p>

<p>Efforts have been made to reduce this bycatch. In the Gulf shrimp 
fishery, which supplies most wild caught shrimp to the United States, 
the ratio was 10 pounds of dead fish for every pound of shrimp. This 
has been reduced to 4 pounds of fish per pound of shrimp. To me, even 
this is an unforgivable waste of sea life. The FAO reports that in 
some regions the ratio is 20 pounds of dead fish per pound of shrimp. 
In other regions, China, for instance, the bycatch is now being sorted 
and used for human food and fish farm feed rather than dumped overboard. 
This is definitely an improvement.</p>

<p>While some say wild shrimp tastes better, I still strongly favor 
farming shrimp, and efforts to reduce the ecological impact. Do note 
that some shrimp fisheries in the Pacific Northwest use pot traps 
instead of nets, and these do not cause the massive waste typical of 
conventional shrimping.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Pacific White Shrimp</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shrmpw07e.jpg" alt="Two White Shrimp" class=mrg>
[Whiteleg Shrimp: <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>]
<p>
This is by far the most common farmed shrimp in our markets, and the 
lowest in price. They are commonly available head on, head off, shelled 
and shelled, de-veined and cooked.</p>
<p>Yield for White Shrimp: &nbsp; "Head-on", 1 pound = 10 oz tail meat 
(63%) plus a substantial broth. "Head-off shell-on", 1 pound = 15 oz tail 
meat (94%, tail fin left on) plus a light broth. Other forms, 1 pound = 
1 pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Tiger Shrimp</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shrmptgr03e.jpg" alt="Three Headless Tiger Shrimp" class=mrg>
[<i>Penaeus monodon</i>] 
<p>
These are recognizable by the stripes on their shell segments. They are 
the second most farmed shrimp, and tend to be larger, and quite a bit 
more expensive than white shrimp. They are sold mostly head off, but 
sometimes head on. The head-off photo specimens, purchased from a 
Philippine market in Los Angeles, were 4.5 inches long and 0.63 inch 
diameter at the thick end, and weighed 0.8 ounces each. Flavor is very 
slightly different from White Shrimp, though you need to do an AB test 
to detect it at all. They are also a little tougher, but not enough to 
be any kind of problem.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Giant Tiger Shrimp</h2>
<p><img src="img/sf_shrmpbig07e.jpg" alt="Three Giant Tiger Shrimp" class=mrg>
[<i>Penaeus monodon</i>]
<p>
These are the same Tiger Shrimp as in the previous paragraph, but 
were allowed to grow bigger - but not nearly as big as they can grow. 
Females can grow to 12 inches and weigh up to 11 ounces, and males to 
10 inches and 6 ounces. The photo specimens were purchased from a Korean 
market in Los Angeles. They were typically 8 inches long and weighed 
1.9 ounces each. Yield of shelled tail was 0.94 ounces 
(51%), and after poaching they yielded 0.75 ounces of cooked shrimp 
(41%). Smaller ones would yield a little less. Flavor isn't a lot  
different from White Shrimp.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Argentine Red Shrimp</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmparz.html">
<img src="img/sf_shmpar04d.jpg" alt="Two Argentine Red Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
[Langostino Rojo Argentino, Gamb&oacute;n Argentino, Langostino Austral, 
Gamb&oacute;n Austral; <i>Pleoticus muelleri</i>]
<p>
These shrimp are native to the Atlantic coast of South America, from 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands.
They can grow to over 8 inches long (head-on) but are more commonly 4 
inches. The head-on photo specimens were up to 8 inches long and 
weighed about 1 ounce each. They are red because they lack the coating 
of gray-green protein many other shrimp have.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Giant Red Shrimp</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmpgrz.html">
<img src="img/sf_crgred04f.jpg" alt="A Giant Red Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Aristaeomorpha foliacea</i>]
<p>
These are deep water shrimp, little known until recently - and yes, 
they are this red before cooking. They are found worldwide from the 
tropics to near the arctic, at depths between 820 and 2450 feet. 
They can grow to almost 8-7/8 inches measured from the tip of the 
rostrum (the toothy spikes at the top of the head extending over the 
eyes) to the tip of the tail. The average is about 5-1/2 inches. The 
photo specimen was just short of 8 inches.

<h2>Ridgeback Shrimp / Prawn</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmprbz.html">
<img src="img/sf_shmprb02f.jpg" alt="Two Ridgeback Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
[Pacific rock shrimp; Camar&oacute;n de piedra del Pac&iacute;fico, 
Cacahuete (Spanish); <i>Sicyonia ingentis</i> of family 
<i>Sicyoniidae</i>]
<p>
These shrimp are native to the coast of California and Baja California, 
from Monerey Bay as far south as the Isla Mar&iacute;a Madre, well off 
the southern tip of Baja, and in the Gulf of California between Baja and 
the mainland. They are characterized by a hard ridge down the back of 
their body and very hard, strong shells. They have long been caught in 
trawls for rock fish, and were discarded because they were hard to shell, 
but they now have a good market due to their excellent flavor. They are, 
however, still a problem shrimp because they decay so rapidly once dead, 
so they need to be kept alive.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Giant River Prawns</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmprpz.html">
<img src="img/sf_prawnfw01f.jpg" alt="Two Giant River Prawns 01f" class=mrg></a>
[Giant Freshwater Prawn, Malaysian Prawn, Freshwater Scampi; Golda 
Chingdi, Cherabin (West Bengal); <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i>]
<p>
These shrimp spend their larval period in brackish water and then move 
to fresh water for the rest of their lives. They are native to the rivers 
of the Indo Pacific region, particularly from West Bengal through 
Indonesia and northern Australia. These can be found in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, but not always. They are noted for their blue color, 
especially on their very long clawed forelimbs. Shrimp farmers break 
off the swinging side of the claws to keep them from tearing each 
other apart. These shrimp can grow to a length of 12 inches (not 
counting the long arms) and are both fished wild and farmed.
&nbsp; <a href="sf_shmprpz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Mantis Shrimp</h2>
<br><a href="sf_mntaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_mntask04h.jpg" alt="Mantis Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
These assassins of the coastline are <u>not</u> Shrimp, but people may 
look for them here, so, see our 
<a href="sf_mntaz.html"><b>Mantis Shrimp</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Paddy Shrimp</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shmppdy02e.jpg" alt="Four Paddy Shrimp" class=mrg>
There has recently been a resurgence of interest in multi-cropping rice 
paddies with shrimp, and using shrimp ponds in conjunction with rice 
paddies. Some operations now grow large shrimp, but traditionally very 
small shrimp have been harvested. These are popular in Southeast Asia, 
particularly Cambodia and Thailand. The photo specimens were about 1-5/8 
inches long.

<p>These shrimp are usually used whole. They are often mixed into a rice 
flour batter and deep fried to make snack pancakes. These are eaten with 
salt, pepper and lime juice, or various dips. Paddy shrimp are also stir 
fried, perhaps with lemon grass, chilis and scallions. They occasionally 
appear in foam trays or bags in the frozen food cases of the Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Krill</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_krill02e.jpg" alt="5 Krill" class=mrg>
[Okiami (Japan); Alamang (Philippine); order <i>Euphausiacea</i>]
<p>
Krill are found in the seas worldwide, and are extremely important to 
oceanic food chains. They can be told from other shrimp by having 
external gills, right behind the main legs. The vast majority are less 
than 7/8 inch in length, though a few species can reach almost 6 inches. 
The Antarctic Krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>) makes up a biomass of 
379,000,000 metric tons.</p>

<p>The annual catch is currently less than 200,000 metric tons. Most is 
used for feed in aquaculture and aquariums. Some is eaten by humans, 
particularly in the Philippines, where it is salted and digested into 
bag&oacute;ng alam&aacute;ng, the shrimp paste of the region. It also 
has a long history of being used as food in Japan. Some of the harvest 
is processed into krill oil, which alarmists are selling at a good 
price to replace fish oil as an Omega 3 supplement, claiming fish oil 
may contain dangerous mercury.</p>

<p>Given its considerable nutrition and large biomass, do-gooders are 
proposing a massive increase the krill harvest to feed the world's 
growing population. This would, of course, just encourage the world's 
population to grow even faster, until the krill harvest ran out. Most 
of the world's population accepts no means of birth control except 
starvation. Ecologists are against this because the entire Antarctic 
ecology is based on krill, and it would mean extinction for penguins, 
seals, blue whales, and destruction of the regions fisheries. Half the 
379 million metric tons of Antarctic krill is eaten by sea animals 
every year, and the rest is needed to replenish the supply.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Tadpole Shrimp</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shmptad01e.jpg" alt="Live Tadpole Shrimp" class=mrg>
[class <i>Branchiopoda</i> order <i>Notostraca</i>]
<p>
These crustaceans are not really shrimp, being in class 
<i>Branchiopoda</i> rather than <i>Malacostraca</i>, but they are 
called "shrimp" just the same. They have been around for about 300 
million years. They are not eaten by people, but can be important for 
weed control in rice paddies. Their eggs can stand being dry for up to 
20 years, so when the paddy is flooded, many eggs hatch. In a 
transplanted paddy the rice plants are too big for tadpole shrimp to 
eat, but weeds, which sprout after the rice is transplanted, are small 
enough and eaten by them. They are also helpful in that they hunt 
down and eat mosquito larva. These shrimp can grow to a body length of 
3 inches, and have a lifespan of about 90 days. They are often kept as 
aquarium pets.

<h2 id="prod" class=lrg>Shrimp Products</h2>
<p></p>

<img src="img/sf_shrimpd07h.jpg" alt="Preserved Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
Shrimp are plentiful in the seas, and easy to process, so there are many 
products made from shrimp. Each country has its own versions and its own 
ways of using them, so it's important match the right types to regional 
cuisines,</p>

<h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; These are found in Asian, Mexican, Central 
and South American markets for use in soups and sauces. They have some 
salt so some recipes ask you to rinse them. I don't - I just toss them 
in the spice grinder and grind them to powder. The photo above shows two 
common sizes, the largest one about 1-1/2 inch long. Even larger ones are 
common in Latin American markets, the smaller ones in Asian markets.
For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> 
page.<p></p>

<h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; These important flavorings are made from 
tiny shrimp, digested with salt, aged in various ways and ground up 
(top right in photo). They may be mixed with oil or other ingredients, 
and are used in soups, sauces and curry pastes. They're a Southeast Asian 
essential, available in Asian markets. For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> page.
<p></p>

<h3>Salted Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; [Saeujeot (Korea)] &nbsp; Salted tiny 
shrimp used in soups and other dishes in China and Korea (top left in 
the photo). They are available in jars in the refrigerated section 
of Korean markets, but these little buggers have so much salt I 
can't believe refrigeration is needed (and one of my Korean cookbooks 
says "keeps unrefrigerated for 1 year").  For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="med" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Shrimp, unlike some large fish, are low enough in the food chain they 
don't concentrate mercury, though that has pretty much proven to be a 
non-problem with most fish (U. Rochester / Seychelles study). Shrimp are 
high in protein, low in fat, with an excellent balance between omega-3 
and omega-6 fats. They have a good mineral content (iron, phosphorus, 
potassium and zinc) as well as being good sources of vitamin 
B-6, B-12, biotin, niacin and carotenoid antioxidants. For complete 
details see <a href="seashrimp.html#s2">Note-S2</a></p>

<p>Some years ago, the AHA (American Heart Association) ran a big scare 
campaign warning people not to eat shrimp or eggs because they were 
"high in cholesterol". As with most of their campaigns, they were wrong. 
Today it is well known that dietary cholesterol has very little effect 
on blood cholesterol for most people. If some dietary cholesterol is 
absorbed, the body compensates by manufacturing a little less internally. 
Cholesterol is very important, as much of your brain is made out of it, 
as well as your cell membranes. In any case, shrimp have been shown to 
have a beneficial effect on the HDL / LDL cholesterol balance. Besides,  
the whole cholesterol / heart disease theory seems to be collapsing now. 
The real culprit appears to be the trans fats and highly processed 
polyunsaturated seed oil fats the AHA spent over 75 years urging us to 
use as a "healthier alternative" to natural fats. </p>
