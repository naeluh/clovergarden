Snails, or Gastropods, appeared in the Lower Cambrian period around 
500 million years ago. Unlike their relatives the bivalves which 
appeared just a little later, snails are quite mobile, even if slowly, 
and were able to extend their domain to land - to the distress of 
gardeners everywhere.</span>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Gastropods first appeared in the seas of the Lower Cambrian period 
more than 500 million years ago and long before there was any life at all 
on land. They were immediately successful and have since expanded their 
range to include fresh water and your garden.</p>

<p>"Gastropod" means "stomach foot" which is inaccurate because the 
stomach is up inside the shell, but they do sort of "crawl around on 
their belly". Gastropod shells (not all have shells) expand in a spiral 
form off to one side of the body as the occupant grows.</p>

<p>Some gastropods are vegetarian, but others are notorious for drilling 
into and eating oysters, clams and other bivalves as well as other 
gastropods. Others will eat just about any organic material they can 
find.</p>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cleaning <small>&amp;</small> Cooking</h2>

<p>Land snails need a lot more pre-preparation than sea or fresh water 
snails because of the slime they depend on for getting around. Basic 
preparation for small snails is to keep them away from food for 2 to 5 
days depending on species to clean out their digestive tract. Land 
snails then need to be de-slimed by application of salt or by other 
means.</p>

<p>Larger snails like conch can be properly disassembled and cleaned so 
do not need any pre-prep (except a good pounding to tenderize them). 
Details for cleaning and preparation are included in the sub-article for 
each variety (click on the photo or on "Details and Cooking").</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties of Snails</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Abalone</h2>
<br><a href="sf_gpabaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpaba07h.jpg" alt="Two Live Abalone" class=mrg></a>
[Awabi (Japan), Abulon (Sp), genus <i>Haliotis</i> various species]
<p>
There are eight species of abalone off the coast of California. Red 
abalone can get up to a foot long but not many get much beyond the 7 inch 
minimum even though harvesting them is highly restricted (free diving 
only, no SCUBA or air tubes, strict limits and closed areas).</p>

<p>All wild abalone populations on the California coast are endangered 
or severely threatened due to poor fishery management, largely the result 
of inadequate data. The only exception is red abalone where severe 
restrictions have been somewhat effective. Some stocks are considered 
beyond natural recovery and must be restored by captive breeding and 
concentration by transplanting, particularly white abalone which is near 
extinction. Stocks in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are 
similarly threatened.</p>

<p>The high price abalone fetches and the short supply has made 
aquaculture viable. Three species are farmed in California: Red 
(<i>H. rufescens</i>) in northern regions, Pink (<i>H. corrugata</i>) 
and Green (photo <i>H. fulgens</i>) in southern regions and Baja 
California. Abalone are fed California giant kelp, the harvest of 
which is also strictly regulated.

<h2>Apple Snail</h2>
<br><a href="sf_gpapplez.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpapple02h.jpg" alt="Apple Snails in Shells" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Pila polita</i> of family <i>Ampullariidae</i>]
<p>
The largest of freshwater snails Apple Snails (various species) are found 
in tropical and subtropical wetlands worldwide. While some species can 
grow to 6 inches, the largest of the photo specimens was 2.6 inches long 
and weighed 1.9 ounces. Others in the batch, frozen whole in Vietnam, 
were smaller. For greater economy, buy frozen packages of apple snail 
meat - 50 or more for the same price as a dozen in the shell.</p>
<p>The <i>Pila</i> snails in the photo are native to Southeast Asia and 
are a preferred eating snail. Unfortunately uneducated nitwits with get 
rich schemes have illegally imported <i>Pomacea canaliculata</i> from 
South America to Taiwan, Southeast Asia, the Philippines and Hawaii. 
These snails have never been a commercial success because snail eaters 
don't like them much and they are devastating rice and taro crops 
wherever introduced, causing severe economic damage and driving out the 
local snails. &nbsp;

<h2>Blunt Creeper Snail</h2>
<br><a href="sf_gpbluntz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpblunt02h.jpg" alt="Blunt Creeper Empty Shells" class=mrg></a>
[Mud Creeper, Matah Merah, Belitong, Chut-chut, Hoy jup jeng (Thai), 
Longburm (Aust.) <i>Cerithidea obtusa</i>, of family <i>Potamididae</i>]
<p>
Found in the brackish waters of mangrove swamps in Southeast Asia 
and Australia, these snails are gathered from the trunks and branches 
of the mangroves and sold live in local markets. The photo specimens 
were from Vietnam and labeled "Top Shell" which they are not. The 
largest would have been about 1-3/4 inches long if the tip hadn't been 
broken off. The tips are generally slightly broken in nature but these 
have been broken farther down to facilitate eating them.

<h2>Brown Garden Snail</h2>
<br><a href="sf_gpbgz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpbg01h.jpg" alt="Brown Garden Snails" class=mrg></a>
[Petit Gris (French), <i>Helix aspersa</i> var <i>muller</i> (alt 
<i>Cantareus aspersus</i>)]
<p>
These snails have been introduced to various parts of the world by French 
immigrants, often with ill conceived dreams of snail farming and always 
with disastrous consequences. They have become quite a pest in California 
and cost many millions of dollars every year. Only ducks, rats and 
Frenchmen seem to want to eat them.</p>
<p>One of the primary "escargot" snails of France, Petit Gris gets up to 
1-3/8 inches across the shell. The other two snails eaten by the French 
are Gros Gris (<i>H. aspersa</i> var <i>maxima</i>) which grows to 1-3/4 
inches and the Bourgogne Snail (<i>H. Pomatia</i>) which gets a little 
bigger than 2 inches. Neither of these is a problem in California, we're 
stuck with the little ones.

<h2>Conch - Queen Conch</h2>
<br><a href="sf_gpconqz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpconq02h.jpg" alt="Empty Queen Conch Shell" class=mrg></a>
[Pink Conch, <i>Tricornis gigas</i>]
<p>
Pronounced "konk", this snail is found throughout the greater Caribbean 
region from South Carolina to Venezuela and around the Atlantic island of 
Bermuda. They can grow to about 13 inches long but the photo specimen is 
8-1/2 inches. They reach sexual maturity in about three years when they 
will be about 8 inches long and weigh about 2 pounds</p>
<p>Long an important food item in the Caribbean it is now in serious 
decline throughout its range. Because much of the region's population is 
poor and lacks education local fishery controls are often ineffective so 
international trade sanctions are in effect. <b><u>It is illegal</u></b> 
to take any queen conch in U.S. waters or to import them, their meat, 
shells or products made from them from a number of countries. Import 
from some countries is still allowed but it's becoming rather expensive 
due to scarcity.</p>
<p><p>Restocking efforts have failed because captive grown conch lack 
survival instincts and are immediately eaten when placed in the ocean. 
It has recently been discovered, however, that queen conch are turned on 
by pheromones drifting over from wildly mating conch of a smaller species 
causing them to mate and spawn. This opens the possibility of closed 
cycle aquaculture.

<h2>Giant African Land Snails</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_gpafglsz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpafgls01e.jpg" alt="Live Giant African Land Snail" class=mrg></a>
[Ejila (Igbo); Igbin (Nigeria); Ibi, Boi-de-oxal&aacute; (Brazil); 
<i>Achatina achatina</i> and <i>Archachatina marginata</i> (West African) 
and also <i>Lissachatina fulicaof</i> (East Africa), all of family 
<i>Achatinidae</i>]
<p>
These giant snails, native to West Africa, can grow to almost 12 inches 
long. They are much liked as food, especially in Nigeria, and constitute 
a major protein source in some parts of West Africa.  In the United 
States they are considered agricultural pests of the first order, and 
seized wherever found.

<h2>Locos / Chilaen Abalone</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_gplocoz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gplocos03d.jpg" alt="Live Locos Snails" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Concholepas concholepas</i> of family <i>Muricidae</i>]
<p>
These look a bit like Abalone, but are not at all related. Abalone are 
primitive vegetarians, and Locos are highly developed murex predators. 
They live mostly on mussels and barnacles, and are native to the entire 
length of the coasts of Peru and Chile, including Cape Horn.</p>
<p> The name "locos" is from a native language of the region, but 
"loco" is Spanish for "crazy", resulting in amusing mistranslations. 
Sustainability of the wild harvest of these snails is problematic, even 
with strict controls, so aquaculture is being studied.

<h2>Moon Snails</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_gpmoonz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpmoon03d.jpg" alt="Live Moon Snails" class=mrg></a>
[probably <i>Lunatia lewisii</i> of family <i>Naticidae</i>]
<p>
Moon Snails are a large, worldwide family of aggressive predators. The 
largest is Lunatia lewisii, which can grow up to 5 inches across. It 
is native to the Eastern Pacific from British Columbia, Canada, south 
to Baja California, Mexico. It primarily eats bivalves, but will eat 
any other molusk it can catch.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in 
Alhambra, California. The largest was 2-1/2 inches in the longest 
dimension and weighed 3-1/4 ounces. There was a much larger one in 
the tank, but I wasn't sure if it was alive or not. Yield for 1 pound 
3-3/8 ounces was 5-1/2 ounces (28%) of which 4-3/8 ounces was firm 
meat (23%). &nbsp;

<h2>Moon Snails, Round</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_gpmoor02d.jpg" alt="Frezen Round Moon Snails" class=mrg>
[<i>Natica ??</i> of family <i>Naticidae</i>]
<p>
Natica is a genus of small to medium sized predatory Moon Snails. The 
photo specimens came in a package labeled "Whole Round Tiger Moon 
<i>Natica tigrina</i>. I question this identification because photos 
I've seen of <i>N. tigrina</i> have a pattern of spots, but these may 
be a closely related species. On the other hand, they look a lot like
small Apple Snails. The photo specimens, from Vietnam, were up to 1.19 
inch length. They were purchased from a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $1.99 / 14 ounce package, frozen.</p>
<p>I do not know how these are used in Vietnam, but they have a fairly 
strong flavor. They are almost impossible to fish out of their shells, 
even with my special Periwinkle tool, and the shells are very strong 
so it's difficult to crush the shell to get thm out. What does come out 
is tiny. The "edible" bit is about as tough as shoe leather even with 
long simmering. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Periwinkles</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_gpperiz.html">
<img src="img/sf_gpperi07h.jpg" alt="Live Periwinkles" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Littorina littorea</i> (common periwinkle) and related 
<i>Littorina</i> species]
<p>
These small snails can get as large as 2 inches long, but the largest in 
the photo batch was 1.2 inches. They live mainly in the surf zone of 
rocky coastlines, so their shells are quite thick and often worn. The 
best known periwinkle, L. littorea, is native to the North Atlantic 
shores of Europe but seems to have made it to North America fairly 
early, some say with Scandinavians who were known to have cut timber 
for export to Iceland as far south as New Jersey, well before 
Columbus' voyage. It is now also found on the East Pacific coast from 
Washington State to California. Other species live worldwide and vary 
considerably in shape and decoration.

<img src="img/sf_gpwafmud01h.jpg" alt="West African Mud Ceeper Shells" class=mrg></a>
[Periwinkle (West Africa); Isam (Nigeria); <i>Tympanotonos fuscatus</i>]
<p>
From all the photographic evidence I have seen, the West African 
"Periwinkle" is not a Periwinkle at all, but the West African Mud 
Creeper. This brackish water snail is very common from Senegal to 
Camaroon and IUCN listed LC (Least Concern). There are several 
varieties, so exact shell decoration varies.</p>
<p>All photographic evidence I have seen also shows their flesh to 
be a very unappetizing blue green color - nonetheless, it is a very 
popular inclusion in soups and stews, particularly in Nigeria.

<h2>Whelks</h2>
<br>[families <i>Buccinidae</i>, <i>Muricidae</i>, others] &nbsp; 
Whelks are a large worldwide family of carnivorous snails Some are  
scavengers, but most are active predators, boring into clams, crabs, 
lobsters and even other whelks. Whelks are a popular eating mollusk in 
Asia and in Europe but are less eaten in North America - but you don't 
have to feel guilty about eating these - they are killers.<p></p>
<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; not all whelks are edible and some 
edible ones can be toxic when the mollusks they eat have been eating 
toxic algae. Consult the local fisheries service for any applicable 
warnings.<p></p>

    [<i>Kelletia kelleti</i>]
    <p>
    This heavy shelled whelk was introduced from the Sea of Japan and is 
    now found on the west coast of North America from Monterey, 
    California south around the tip of Baja California into the Gulf of 
    California. They are both scavengers and predators. They compete with 
    starfish for food, and are sometimes eaten by starfish. The photo 
    specimens were purchased live from a large Asian market in San 
    Gabriel, California. The largest was 5.25 inches long and weighed 
    8.2 ounces. &nbsp;

    <p>
    This light shelled whelk is native to the east coast of North 
    America, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts south to northern Florida, and 
    has been introduced to San Francisco Bay.  This whelk feeds on hard 
    shelled clams, which it pries open with the edge of its shell, which 
    tends to be chipped, as in the photo. They are preyed upon by blue 
    crabs. The photo specimens were purchased live from a large Asian 
    market in Alhambra, California. The largest was 6-1/4 inches long 
    and weighed 8-3/8 ounces. Yield was 2-3/4 ounces (33%) of flesh after 
    steaming long enough to release it.

    <p>
    This large, heavy shelled whelk is native to the east coast of North 
    America, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to northern Florida. It 
    feeds on clams, mussels and oysters, which it pries open with the 
    edge of its shell, which tends to be a bit chipped. Once the clam 
    is slightly opened, the whelk extends it's mouth into the shell. It 
    then shreds the victim alive with it's rasp like radula, and digests 
    it. These whelks are preyed upon by crabs. and starfish.
    They can grow to 12 inches long, but the one in the photo was 7-3/4 
    inches and weighed 2 pounds.

    <p>
    These cold water whelks are harvested worldwide. The photo specimens 
    were purchased lightly cooked, frozen and bagged from a large Asian 
    market in Alhambra, California. They typically weighed 1-3/8 ounce. 
    A 1-1/2 pound bag yielded 8-5/8 ounces of cooked edible meat 
    (36%) after cooking just long enough to remove it from the shells.

    <br>
    <img src="img/sf_gpwhlkrapa02h.jpg" alt="Live Rapa Whelk" class=mrg>
    [<i>Rapana venosa</i>]
    <p>
    Native to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan, these large Asian 
    whelks are now distributed worldwide as an invasive species. They 
    have probably traveled in the larval stage in ships' ballast water. 
    They have recently invaded the hardshell clam and oyster beds of the 
    U.S. East Coast and are eating many of these economically valuable 
    molusks.</p>
    <p>Rapa Whelks can't be eradicated, their shells are too thick for 
    local predators to penetrate, and they are very large, more than 
    7 inches across. On the plus side, rapas are reputed to be a highly 
    edible (better than conch in some opinions) so people should get 
    used to eating them.
