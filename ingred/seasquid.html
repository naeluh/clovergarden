Squid are the largest and most mobile of the mollusks. Giant squid grow 
to over 33 feet from tentacle tip to tail and Colossal Squid can exceed 
46 feet. These huge squid are suspected of being among the most 
intelligent creatures in the sea. They communicate with each other by 
rapid changes of skin color and pattern, but what these mean has not yet 
been decoded You will not be eating one of those because they live too 
deep to catch, and their flesh is laced with toxic ammonia anyway. 
Market size squid (different species) are, however, plentiful and good 
eating.</p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Squid are Cephalopod mollusks (<i>Cephalopoda</i>) and related to 
Octopi but only at the Subclass level (<i>Coleoidea</i>) so it's not 
real close. They became a distinct line from other Cephalopods about 
400 million years ago.</p>
<p>Squid is a favored seafood in Italy, Southeast Asia, and other 
countries with long coastlines, but has never been that popular with 
Americans. Once scarce, it can now be easily found in markets serving 
Philippine and other Southeast Asian communities.</p>
<p>Squid contain a sack of black ink which they use to create a screen 
when escaping from predators. In Italy the ink is used to dye pasta 
black, and it is used in Spain as a dye in some recipes. In North 
America the ink sack is usually removed before marketing, but you can 
get this ink from emporia selling Spanish food items.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>In North America, squid are not marketed by variety, only by size. 
That limits you to choosing (by size) fresh, dried, or otherwise 
prepared.</p>

<h2>Fresh Squid</h2>
<br>Most "fresh" squid have been previously frozen to preserve their 
freshness during distribution, but that does no damage. Pictured at the 
top of this page are medium and "jumbo" squid typical of those found in 
Asian markets in Southern California. The "jumbo" size can be up to 
2-1/2 pounds but averages about 1-3/4 pounds. Bodies 
(exclusive of head and tentacles) run between 9 and 13 inches long. 
Fresh raw squid can be ordered in sushi bars as "ika" and is one of 
my favorites.<p></p>

<h2>Frozen Squid</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_squidfz02d.jpg" alt="Dry Squid" class=mrg>
Frozen squid can be found in regular North American markets in two 
forms: rings (small squid) and calamari steaks (large squid). The larger  
Asian markets here in Los Angeles also have whole cleaned and skinned 
squid bodies and tentacles, which may be packaged together or separately. 
<p>All sizes of squid tubes, from 2 inch to 10 inch, are available, 
cleaned, sometimes bleached, and sometimes scalded, Thaw and treat as 
fresh squid with very brief cooking or a long simmer. The photo shows 
a 10 inch squid body, split and flattened, a 6 inch squid body left as 
a tube, but with fins removed, and a pile of tentacles from very small 
squid.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Dried Squid</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_squiddry05e.jpg" alt="Dry Squid" class=mrg>
Dried squid can be found in practically any market serving an East or 
Southeast Asian community - it's a popular snack just chewed on as is.
Shown in the photo are sizes "XL" (15 inch body) and "M" (7 inch body). 
Back in the '60s these would be piled in bins and barrels in Chinatown, 
but today they are mostly in plastic bags and refrigerated.

<h2>Humboldt Squid</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_squidhb02e.jpg" alt="Live Humboldt Squid" class=mrg>
[Jumbo Squid, Jumbo Flying Squid; Pota, Diablo Rojo (Spanish); 
<i>Dosidicus gigas</i>]
<p>
This is the largest of the edible squid, growing to nearly 5 feet long 
and a weight of 110 pounds. It is not yet well known in North America, 
because its range was only between Peru and central Mexico. For reasons 
not yet known, it has recently expanded its range from the southern tip 
of Chile to Alaska. This is of great concern to coastal fisheries 
because the Humboldt Squid is a voracious predator that only Sperm 
Whales and very large fish like Swordfish are able to prey upon. 
LIke the Giant Squid, and unlike smaller squid, their sucker disks are 
lined with sharp, hooked teeth</p>
<p>These squid are judged to be at least as intelligent as dogs. 
They communicate with each other by rapidly changing skin colors and 
patterns, but what they are communicating is still unknown. There have 
long been fisheries for this squid in Peru and southern Mexico, but 
now in Chile, and a sports fishery in Southern California. More will 
doubtless be established as the squid continues to expand its range 
and population, and good harvests will be needed to keep them from 
eating all the fish. This squid is large enough to produce Calamari 
Steaks, which are often exported from South Ameica.

<h2 id=health class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Squid is very high in selenium and high in phosphorus, riboflavin and 
vitamin B12.</p>
<p>Squid is high in cholesterol. That was once a big scare, but it is 
now known the body manufactures most of its own cholesterol and dietary 
cholesterol has little effect for most people. In fact, populations 
that eat large amounts of high cholesterol shrimp and squid tend to have 
a low incidence of coronary disease. Eating too little cholesterol is 
now suspected of having negative effects on health.</p>
