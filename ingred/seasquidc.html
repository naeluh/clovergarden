<h1>Cleaning, Cutting <small>&amp;</small> Cooking Small Squid</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The proliferation of Asian markets in the U.S. has given us easy 
access to squid, particularly small and medium squid. The photo is of 
medium, about 8 inches mantle length (excludes head and tentacles). 
These mollusks are popular worldwide, and it's time Americans learned 
to appreciate them too.</p>

<h2 id="clean" class=lrg>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Fresh squid is generally sold whole as caught, so you'll have to clean 
and prepare it yourself. Whole uncleaned squid of this sort can weigh 
from 1 ounce each for small to about 4 ounces for medium. Completely 
cleaning 2 pounds of small squid (about 30 count) should take you 
35 minutes, not much more than 1 minute each. If you need to save time, 
Asian markets sell trays of frozen squid tubes already cleaned and 
skinned, with or without tentacles. </p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp;  A pound of fresh uncleaned squid of 1 ounce 
size yields about 6-1/8 ounces (38%) of cleaned bodies and 3-1/3 ounces 
(21%) of tentacles, making a total yield of 9-3/8 ounces (59%). Larger 
squid will yield a little better.
<br class=cll><p></p> 

<p><img src="img/ke_squid05d.jpg" alt="Tools" class=mrg>
All you really need for squid is a cutting board, a sharp kitchen knife 
and a grapefruit spoon. Narrow pointy grapefruit spoons are best for 
squid and grapefruit but can be hard to find these days.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_squid01d.jpg" alt="Small Squid" class=mrg>
We start out with whole fresh squid about 10 or 12 inches long including 
the tentacles. These can be obtained in bulk from most Asian markets.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_squid11d.jpg" alt="Squid apart" class=mrg>
First cut off the tentacles right in front of the eyes. If you get it just 
right the beak will stay behind with the eyes and the tentacles will still 
be together in a star formation. more likely the beak came with the 
tentacles, just push it out and discard.</p>

<p>Next place the squid body in the palm of 
your hand and wrap your fingers around just tight enough to keep it from 
slipping away. Pull the head off and the innards will come along with it.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> some recipes call for squid ink so if you're cooking one 
of those locate the ink sack in the pile of innards and remove it. In my 
experience, squid sold around here have little or no ink, so it's easier 
to order it from any on-line emporium specializing in Spanish food 
products.
<br class=cll></p>

<p>You should now be able to feel the end of the nearly transparent 
"pen". Pull it straight out. If the squid was handled roughly it may be 
broken in which case fish out the pieces - here the grapefruit spoon 
comes in handy, and long nose pliers may help.</p>

<p>Now lay the squid body flat on your cutting board. With the fingers 
of one hand hold down the tip of the tail. With the other hand run the 
side of your thumb flat across the body from the tail to the head end, 
pushing out all the remaining jelly stuff.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_squid13d.jpg" alt="Squid Cleaned" class=mrg>
Break the skin and just rub it off under cold running water. You may or 
may not loose one or both of the tail fins doing this, I usually try to 
keep the fins on. You will end up with white squid bodies and a small 
pile of purple tentacles.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; Do not cook the tentacles with the bodies if 
you want bright white bodies, the skin pigment bleeds and will stain the 
white bodies an unappetizing color. You can cook them in the same water 
after the bodies have been removed.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>

<h2 id="cut" class=lrg>Cutting</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_squid15d.jpg" alt="Cuts &amp; curles" class=mrg>
You may now cut the body into whatever shape you desire. Commercially squid  
are most often just cut crosswise into rings - easy, but boring. You can 
easily cut them to form other shapes.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; When cutting tubes open to lay flat, cut 
along the line where the "pen" was removed for neatest results.<p></p>

<h3>Note:</h3> &nbsp; Squid always curls from front to back and inside 
out, so if you score the flesh for decorative effects score the inside 
surface.<p></p>

<p>The photo shows (top left) half the body split 
lengthwise. When cooked it rolls up to form the shape just below. In the 
center, a whole squid body was split lengthwise, flattened out and cut as 
shown. The curls that result are below it. On the right, the body has been 
split lengthwise, flattened and cut crosswise into three pieces (one shown). 
The flesh was scored to form a pattern on the curled tube.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Cooking</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_squid06h.jpg" alt="Tentacles" class=mrg>
If it's really, really fresh, you don't even have to cook it. Squid is 
one of my favorite sushi items.</p>

<p>Squid should be cooked for a very short time at high temperature or 
simmered quite a long time. In between it has all the edibility of rubber 
bands. A strongly acid marinade as for Adobo may relieve this somewhat.
Long cooked, the squid has a somewhat different flavor and the texture 
is firm but not crunchy as it is with very short cooking.</p>

<p>Cooked for less than 20 seconds, yield will be near 100% of raw, but 
much longer and the squid will shrink alarmingly. Your big pile of raw 
squid will become a much smaller pile, and it's weight will be about 60% 
of raw. Most of the shrinkage happens in the first couple of minutes. 
Recipes must be designed to take this into account.</p>

<p>If short wet cooking, you should have the water at a rolling boil and 
drop in a small amount of squid so the water stays hot. Pull between 10 
and 20 seconds depending on thickness of the squid. A minute will get 
you tough squid. An easy way to do this is to heat a pot filled almost 
to the brim. Put some squid in a wire strainer and lower it into the 
boiling water so the squid is submerged. Count the seconds, then pull 
out the strainer and immediately quench the squid in cold running water.
</p>

<p>If you are going the long simmering route, check your squid often 
for taste and texture. You want to pull it as soon as it becomes tender 
enough, but still has some bite. Overcooked squid loses both flavor and 
texture. The time will be about 40 minutes in most cases.</p>

<p>When frying, squid may be lightly battered or not battered at all. 
For unbattered squid get your oil plenty hot and stir fry for 10 or 15 
seconds. For battered squid deep fry a small amount at a time in very 
hot oil (390&deg;F/200&deg;C) and for the minimum time needed to color 
the batter.</p>

<p>The tentacles are lovely, but if you are wet cooking your squid and 
want the bodies nice and white, cook the tentacles separately, either in 
different water or after all the bodies have been cooked. The tentacles 
have purple skin on them and will discolor the white bodies if cooked 
with them. For some recipes with lots of other colored ingredients it 
doesn't matter.
