<p>
When we say "Best Fish" we mean selections that stay intact or 
at least fairly intact with the wet cooking times needed for these 
dishes. There are fish soups that are pur&eacute;ed or it is 
desirable for it to fall apart into flakes. The fish here will 
all work fine for pur&eacute;e, but avoid the "Very Firm Fish" if 
you want them to flake apart in the soup. The photo is of a Philippine

<p>We have included mainly fish that can frequently be found here in 
Southern California. If you have an unusual fish, check our main

<h3>Emperor</h3>

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_empep11e.jpg" alt="Pink Ear Emperor 06e" width="260" height="121" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Lethrinus species</i>]
<p>
These Indo - West Pacific fish are fairly common in Asian fish markets, 
but often mislabeled. They are usually around 1-1/2 pounds.  They can 
often be used as a substitute for Monkfish. 
&nbsp; <a href="sf_emperpz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; Light-medium distinctive flavor, low oil, 
very firm for long cooking.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Not preferred.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Monkfish</h3>
<br><a href="sf_monkz.html">
<img src="img/sf_monk07e.jpg" alt="Monkfish Tail" width="260" height="94" class=mrg></a>
[Angler, <i>Lophius americanus</i> (North America), 
<i>Lophius piscatorius</i> (Europe)]
<p>
This fish is often called for in soup and stew recipes, but is fairly 
expensive. Monkfish is mostly a huge ugly inedible bony head and only 
the small tail end is sold, usually about 1-1/4 pounds.  
&nbsp; <a href="sf_monkz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; Light Lobster-like flavor, low oil, very 
firm for long cooking. Not kosher.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Mild and pleasant - but not much of it so may 
be blended with other stock.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><h3>Snakehead / Mudfish</h3> 
<br><a href="sf_snakehz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_snake16e.jpg" alt="Whole Snakehead Fish" width="260" height="73" class=mrg></a>
[Snakehead  murrel; Dalag (Phil.); Murrel (India); <i>Channa striata</i>]
<p>
This is one of the most important food fish in Thailand, Vietnam and 
Malaysia, and popular in India and the Philippines. It can grow to 
6.6 pounds but is commonly marketed at 1-1/2 pounds. 
&nbsp; <a href="sf_snakehz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; Light-medium flavor, low oil, firm enough 
for long cooking.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Use skins only. In Asia skins are sold 
separately at a higher price.
<br class=cll></p>


<p><br></p>

<h2 id="med">Medium Firm Fish</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Parrotfish</h3>
<br><a href="sf_parrotz.html">
<img src="img/sf_parrot08e.jpg" alt="Whole Parrot Fish" width="260" height="115" class=mrg></a>
[Genus Scarus]
<p>
There are a number of Parrot fish found in the Asian fish markets, and 
they are difficult to identify with certainty, but don't dispair, they 
all cook pretty much the same. 
&nbsp; <a href="sf_parrotz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; moderate flavor, low oil, firm enough for 
soups, stews and curries.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; A little too strong, and usually greenish.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Black Pomfret</h3>
<br><a href="sf_pombz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pomfbk15e.jpg" alt="Whole Black Pomfret Fish" width="260" height="168" class=mrg></a>
[Parastromateus niger]
<p>
Actually a Pompano, not a Pomfret, this is a prized eating fish. It can 
be cooked by just about any method, and used skin-on or skin-off. 
&nbsp; <a href="sf_pombz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; pleasant mild flavor, but not bland. Firm 
enough for soups, stews and curries.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; excellent for soup, mild and almost clear.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Pompano, Golden / Florida</h3>
<br><a href="sf_pompcz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pompg12e.jpg" alt="Whole Goldern Pompano" width="260" height="145" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Trachinotus carolinus</i> (Florida Pompano, Common Pompano); 
  <i>Trachinotus blochii</i> (Golden Pompano, Asian Pompano)]
<p>
This is an outstanding fish for almost any method of cooking, skin-on 
or skin-off. It is heavily farmed so almost always available.  
&nbsp; <a href="sf_pompcz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; pleasant mild flavor, but not bland. Firm 
enough for soups, stews and curries.
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; excellent for soup, mild and almost clear.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="mod">Moderately Firm Fish</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Tilapia</h3> 
<br><a href="sf_tilapz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_tilap10e.jpg" alt="Whole Tilapia Fish" width="260" height="132" class=mrg></a>
[Nile Tilapia; <i>Oreochromis niloticus niloticus</i>]
<p>
This is a good general purpose fish, and I always keep some frozen 
fillets handy. Whole fish are 1 to 2 pounds, fillets 5 to 10 ounces. 
This fish has been farmed for at least 4000 years.
&nbsp; <a href="sf_tilapz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; mild but not insipid taste, can stand 
moderate wet cooking.  
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Good moderate stock, even with skins included.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Dover Sole</h3> 
<br><a href="sf_doverz.html">
<img src="img/sf_dovers03e.jpg" alt="Dover Sole Fillets" width="260" height="118" class=mrg></a>
[Slime Fish, Slippery Sole; <i>Microstomus pacificus</i>]
<p>
This fish is <b>NOT</b> the Dover Sole called for in European recipes 
(that one is Common Sole, <i>Solea solea</i>). Fortunately, you are 
unlikely to encounter this one except as frozen fillets - and that's bad 
enough.
&nbsp; <a href="sf_doverz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
<br><b>Character:</b> &nbsp; insipid taste, tremendous shrinkage in 
cooking, and will fall apart if you look at it hard. 
<br><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; don't even think about it.
