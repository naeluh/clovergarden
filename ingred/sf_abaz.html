[Aba Aba, Aba (Nigeria); Poisson-cheval (French); African Knifefish, 
Frankfish, Freshwater Rat-tail; <i>Gymnarchus niloticus</i>]
<p>
These low voltage electric fish are found in swamps, lakes, and rivers in 
drainage basins of the Nile, Turkana, Chad, Niger, Volta, Senegal, and 
Gambia rivers. They can grow to a little over 5 feet long and weigh up to 
42 pounds. They have poor vision and hunt at night, using electrical fields 
for navigation and to locate prey. Propelled by their long dorsal fin, they 
can swim both forward and backwards, which most fish can't do. They have much 
larger brains than most fish, thought necessary to control and monitor their 
electric systems. They are quite successful, so IUNC Red List LC (Least 
Concern).</p>

Smoke Dried Fish is very popular in West Africa, but Aba Aba is much too 
large to dry whole as is usually done. For this reason, in northern Nigeria 
it is cut into chunks before smoke drying into a form called Mangala. This 
honor it shares with larger catfish in the region. Mangala is available 
on-line in North America, and is used for flavoring soups and stews. The 
specimens in the photo are Aba Aba.<p></p>
