   This Indo-Pacific fish can grow to 3 inches but the photo specimen, 
   shown with a toothpick for scale, was 2-1/2 inches and weighed .075 
   ounce (that's over 200 to the pound). They are found in the Persian 
   Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the West-Central Pacific as far southeast 
   as Fiji and as far north as Taiwan.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These anchovies are common here in Southern 
California in markets serving Southeast Asian communities, particularly 
Filipino. They may be on ice, or in trays in the freezer cases.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Clearly you are not going to be filleting this 
fish except under a microscope. This is a fish to fry crisp and eat "head 
guts and feathers" -  not an exact fit to the the delicate sensibilities 
of the baby spinach set.</p>
<ol>
<li>Heat oil for deep fry - it doesn't have to be really deep for these 
fish. I fry in an Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">Kadhai</a>, 
  which has the best geometry for keeping oil in the pan, not on the 
  stove.</li>
<li>Rinse the fish and drain thoroughly in a strainer.</li>
<li>Mix salt to taste with rice flour or sweet potato flour. Dump fish 
  and flour into a paper bag and shake the bag until fish are evenly 
  coated.</li>
<li>Pour the fish out into a strainer and shake the strainer over a plate 
until as much flour as is going to fall off falls off.</li>
<li>Fry fish in batches that don't crowd the pan. Use a durable oil 
  like Olive Pomace at about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. Fry until crispy and 
  lightly colored (exact color will depend on the type of flour you use). 
  You can tell they're done when the amount of sizzling declines.</li>
<li>Serve with a liquid dipping sauce and/or lemon wedges. Anchovies 
  are strong flavored fish, so a dip with fairly intense flavor is good, 
  with maybe a touch of sweetness to counter the slight bitterness of 
  the fish.</li>
</ol>
