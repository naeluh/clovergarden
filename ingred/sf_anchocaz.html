[<i>Engraulis mordax</i>]
<p>
This anchovy is found from the Canadian border to the tip of Baja 
California. They can grow to 9-3/4 inches and weigh 2.4 ounces, but the photo 
specimen was 5-3/4 inches and weighed 0.7 ounce. Longer and a bit chunkier 
than most anchovies, the California anchovy is used mostly for fishmeal and 
tuna bait, but is also sold fresh here in California, and is just 
occasionally canned.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These anchovies are often found sold on ice in 
fish markets serving a Southeast Asian, particularly Filipino, community. 
They may also be available frozen.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Anchovies are generally eaten fried as an 
appetizer, head and tail on, head off, or filleted.<p></p>
 
<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; These fish are very easy to fillet but a bit 
tedious to get to the filleting point. for 5-1/2 inch fish, 2.9 
ounces yielded 1.5 ounces of fillet (52%). For efficiency do each step on 
all the fish before going on to the next step.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish using a delicate scraping instrument such as the back 
edge of your filleting knife. If some skin scrapes off don't worry about 
it.</li>
<li>With kitchen shears cut off the tail, then cut off the head diagonally 
just behind the collar. Pull the head off with the pectoral fins just 
behind it, taking the innards with it.</li>
<li>With your filleting knife slit the belly back to the pelvic fins.</li>
<li>Pinch off the pelvic fins and pull out the anal fin. With this 
delicate a fish you shouldn't need to make any cuts to do this. Check the 
body cavity and rinse out any remaining innards or membranes.</li>
<li>Set the fish on its back and, starting near the tail end, flatten it 
out, leaving the backbone standing between the sides. Grasp the backbone 
near the tail end and pull it out of the fish. Do not worry about the 
hair-like ribs, they'll disappear with cooking or processing.</li>
<li>Fold the halves back together, and holding the fish from the sides, 
pull out the dorsal fin.</li>
