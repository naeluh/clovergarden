[Gray Anchovy (market); C&aacute; Com Than (Viet); 
  <i>Stolephorus chinensis</i>]
<p>
   This West Pacific fish can grow to 3.5 inches but the photo specimen 
   was 2-3/4 inches. A tray of 70 weighed 14 ounces, 0.2 ounces each, 
   or 80 to the pound. They are found mainly in the South China Sea, 
   from Borneo north to Taiwan and around the Philippines, and west 
   around the Malay Peninsula. Color stripes (wide silver with narrow 
   dark above) is like the Blue Anchovy, but this one is larger with 
   a bigger eye and different shaped face.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can sometimes be found in the freezer  
cases of large Asian markets. The photo specimen, from Vietnam, was 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2016 US $2.62 per pound. It was from a frozen batch packed on a foam 
tray sealed in a plastic bag, 14 ounces.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Clearly you are not going to be filleting this 
fish except under a microscope. This is a fish to fry crisp and eat "head 
guts and feathers" -  not an exact fit to the the delicate sensibilities 
of the baby spinach set.<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Heat oil for deep fry - it doesn't have to be really deep for these 
fish. I fry in an Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">Kadhai</a>, 
  which has the best geometry for keeping oil in the pan, not on the 
  stove.</li>
<li>Rinse the fish and drain thoroughly in a strainer.</li>
<li>Mix salt to taste with rice flour or sweet potato flour. Dump fish 
  and flour into a paper bag and shake the bag until fish are evenly 
  coated.</li>
<li>Pour the fish out into a strainer and shake the strainer over a plate 
  until as much flour as is going to fall off falls off.</li>
<li>Fry fish in batches that don't crowd the pan. Use a durable oil 
  like Olive Pomace at about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. Fry until crispy and 
  lightly colored (exact color will depend on the type of flour you use). 
  You can tell they're done when the amount of sizzling declines.</li>
<li>Serve with a liquid dipping sauce and/or lemon wedges. Anchovies 
  are strong flavored fish, so a dip with fairly intense flavor is good, 
  with maybe a touch of sweetness to counter the slight bitterness of 
  the fish.</li>
