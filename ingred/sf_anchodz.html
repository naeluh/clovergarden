<p>
   This form of dried fish is used very widely in East and Southeast 
   Asia. They come in many sizes, the photo showing some of the smallest 
   (0.68 inch long) and largest (2.5 inches long) common sizes. These 
   were purchased at a Korean market in Los Angeles. The small ones are 
   often crushed to paste with some water to make an impromptu fish sauce 
   for use in soups, stir fries and the like. The larger are used to 
   make Korean Anchovy Stock, a very important basic ingredient.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These dried fish are plentiful in Korean 
markets, packaged in small plastic bags, but are also available in 
most markets serving any Southeast Asian community.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep dry in a very tightly sealed container. If 
they came with a packet of dehydrator, include it in the container.
<p></p>
