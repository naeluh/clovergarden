   [<i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>]
   <p>European anchovies are found on the west coast of South Africa all 
   the way up to Norway and in the western Mediterranean. Live they look 
   a lot like the California anchovy but are a little more elongated and 
   a bit smaller, growing to just under 9 inches. In Europe they are sold 
   fresh, frozen, dried and salted, but are familiar to Americans in cans 
   from Morocco. Unfortunately Morocco makes truly awful canned anchovies.

<p>Anchovies are a very important culinary ingredient, used in many 
salad dressings and sauces. A small amount of anchovy can significantly 
increase savory (umami) elements in a recipe without imparting a 
noticeable anchovy flavor. Other recipes use plenty of anchovy. Our 
<a href="../recipes/djx_dress1.html"><b>Spanish Salad Dressing</b></a> 
has lots of anchovies, and has been well liked by people who claimed 
they hated anchovies.</p>

<p>For preparing fresh anchovies see <a href="sf_anchocaz.html">
<b>California Anchovys</b></a>. The California is a little bigger and a little 
stockier but otherwise pretty much the same.</p>

Salted and canned anchovies are made by a method very similar to that used 
to make fermented fish sauce (Roman garum, Thai nam pla). The difference is 
that the heads and guts are removed before packing in salt -  preventing 
the fish from digesting themselves down to clear liquid.</p>

<p>The fish are layered with salt in barrels and rocks are put on 
top to keep them submerged for 6 to 10 months at controlled temperatures. 
After this time they are skinned, filleted and packed.</p>

<p> From Roman times anchovies were salt packed but the oil pack we know 
today came into use during the 1800s. Unlike other canned products, no heat 
is applied when packing anchovies. Many chefs insist the salt packed are 
superior but that form is very hard to find in North America.</p>

Morocco produces about 24% of the world's supply of canned anchovies and 
nearly half those imported into North America. Unfortunately the Moroccans 
are even worse at anchovies than they are at sardines, so that's really 
bad. I've had cans of Moroccan anchovies (multiple brands) that seemed 
mostly bones, fins and scales mixed in with a few over salted fillets that 
disintegrated to mush if touched. Those packaged for top brand names like 
Crown Prince, are better, but still not as good as from other sources. 
Unfortunately most Americans have tasted only Moroccan anchovies - so 
they either have an intense dislike for anchovies, or they are masochists.
</p>

<p>Spanish anchovies are widely considered the best, but are pretty much 
unavailable to most of us in North America. Italian anchovies can be found 
put up in glass jars (photo at left). A jar is costly, but a good 
investment. It'll keep over a year in the fridge, and after the anchovies 
are gone you can use the fine anchovy flavored olive oil. Trader Joe's 
has Italian anchovies in the familiar cans.</p>

<p>I've purchased canned anchovies from Peru and Chili that were 
excellent, as good as the Italian. They were put up in the same 2oz 
cans the Moroccans use.  I did get a distressed email from a Moroccan 
marketing guy who told me (among other things) the South American anchovy 
is inferior to the European, but so long as they make a fine product out 
of it, I couldn't care less.</p> 

<p>Norway used to be famous for anchovies, but the canneries have been 
replaced nu oil refineries since discovery of North Sea oil.</p>

<p>Very fine anchovies are prepared in various ways in Spain and parts of 
Italy for local consumption. They are served as tapas and snacks in 
bistros and bars throughout Spain. American tourists won't touch them - 
and the Spaniards laugh.</p>

<p><b><u>Warning</u>:</b> &nbsp; what is called "Anchovy" in Sweden is 
totally different from what the rest of the world calls Anchovy. Theirs 
are sprats canned in a special way. These can be found in the food 
section of Ikea stores, and not much of anywhere else. Many attempts to 
make <a href="../recipes/vaf_temptjan1.html">Jansson's Temptation</a> 
have been totally ruined by not knowing this.</p>
