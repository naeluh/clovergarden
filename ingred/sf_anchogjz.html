  These very large Anchovies (up to nearly 18 inches) are native to the 
  coast of China, from Hong Kong north around the west coast of Korea 
  and down to southwest Japan. This fish is a commercial catch throughout 
  its range, its large size making it an attractive food fish. These are 
  marine fish, but can tolerate fresh water and go as far as 600 miles up 
  the Yangtze river. They are called "grenadier" in common with 
  many other fish with a similar tapered body style.

  <p>A similar fish, the Yangtze Grenadier Anchovy (<i>Coilia 
  brachygnathus</i>) is also fished commercially in China, but is a 
  strictly fresh water fish confined to the Yangtze River System. It 
  is smaller, growing to nearly 12 inches long.</p>

<p>Because it is so large, this fish is more used for food than other 
Grenadier Anchovies (genus <I>Coilia</i>). In Japan it is used for Etsu 
sushi, a very prestigious sushi because of its rarity. This fish is only 
found in the Chikugo River during May, June and July. It is also grilled, 
fried and used in soup.</p>

To the left are pictured fillets from a can labeled "Long Tailed 
Anchovies", fried, (MaLing brand from China). These came in a large flat 
can holding 6-1/2 ounces. The can was quite light for its size because 
it contained almost no liquid, just a little oil. The fillets were about 
3 inches long.</p>
<p>These have a fairly strong, salty flavor, but quite different from 
regular canned anchovies - more like kippers. They can be used as a salty 
snack item, or as a flavoring ingredient in dishes that would otherwise 
be a little too bland.
