<p>
  Native to the Indo-West Pacific, this is the only species of the 
  Grenadier Anchovies (genus <i>Coilia</i>) that is fished commercially 
  in the region. It ranges along the coast from Bombay, India around to 
  Southeast Asia, and is most prolific in Indonesian waters. It is 
  larger than normal anchovies, up to almost 8 inches long.  Primarily a 
  marine fish, it can tolerate low salinity in estuaries. These fish 
  are called "grenadier" in common with many other fish with a similar 
  tapered body style. It is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated), but is 
  not considered threatened.

This photo to the left shows two dried Goldspotted Grenadiers. They are 
for use as a flavoring element, just as smaller dried anchovies are. They 
were eviscerated before drying, as required by U.S. import law. They were 
typically 6-1/2 inches long and weighed 1/4 ounce each, product of 
Myanmar (Burma). The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $4.59 for a 4 ounce 
package.
