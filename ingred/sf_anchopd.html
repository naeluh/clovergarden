   <p>Most well known in North America is the European anchovy 
   (<i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>) found packaged as fillets in jars and 
   cans, mostly from Italy and Morocco, but they are also found salted. 
   In Europe they are also sold fresh, frozen and dried. Other species 
   of anchovy are very much used in Asia, mainily in dried form.

<b><u>Notice</u>:</b> &nbsp; what the Swedes, Danes and Finns call 
"Anchovy" (Ansjove) is totally different from what the rest of the world 
calls Anchovy. Theirs are sprats canned in a special spiced pickle. 
Many attempts to make <a href="../recipes/vaf_temptjan1.html">Jansson's 
Temptation</a> have been totally ruined by not knowing this. The Swedes 
call our Anchovies "Sardeller". For details and buying them, see our 
<a href="sf_spratz.html"><b>Sprats</b></a> page.

<p><b>Anchovies</b> are a very important culinary ingredient, used in 
many salad dressings and sauces. A small amount of anchovy can 
significantly increase savory (umami) elements in a recipe without 
imparting a noticeable fishy flavor. Other recipes use plenty of anchovy. 
Our <a href="../recipes/djx_dress1.html"><b>Spanish Salad Dressing</b></a> 
has lots of anchovies, and has been well liked by people who claimed 
they hated anchovies.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Anchovies</b> can be prepared in the manner given on our 
<a href="sf_anchocaz.html"><b>California Anchovys</b></a> page.</p>

Salted and canned anchovies are made by a method very similar to that used 
to make fermented fish sauce (Roman garum, Thai nam pla). The difference is 
that the heads and guts are removed before packing in salt -  preventing 
the fish from digesting themselves down to clear liquid. The fish are 
layered with salt in barrels and rocks are put on top to keep them 
submerged for 6 to 10 months at controlled temperatures. After this 
time they are skinned, filleted and packed.</p>
<p><p>From Roman times anchovies were salt packed but the oil pack cans 
so familiar today came into use during the 1800s. Unlike other canned 
products, no heat is applied when packing anchovies.

<p><img src="img/sf_anchovyeu06c.jpg" alt="Jar of Italian Anchovies" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2">
<p><b>Storing:</b> &nbsp; I have noticed that unopened canned anchovies 
tend to lose their firmness in a few months at room temperature and can 
no longer be removed from the can without braking up. Anchovies in jars 
can be more conveniently stored in the fridge for longer keeping, 
even up to a year after opening.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Morocco produces about 24% of the world's supply 
of canned anchovies and nearly half those imported into North America. 
Unfortunately I have been very disappointed in Moroccan anchovies. I've 
had cans of Moroccan anchovies (multiple brands) that seemed mostly 
bones, fins and scales mixed in with a few over salted fillets that 
disintegrated to mush if touched. Those packaged for top brand names 
like Crown Prince, are better, but still not as good as from other 
sources.</p>
<p>Spanish anchovies are widely considered of finest quality, but are 
pretty much unavailable to most of us in North America. Italian anchovies 
can be found put up in glass jars (photo at left) and sometimes cans. A 
jar is costly, but has lots of fillets in it and is a good investment. 
It'll keep over a year in the fridge, and after the anchovies are gone 
you can use the anchovy flavored olive oil.</p>
<p>I've purchased canned anchovies from Peru and Chili that were 
excellent. They were put up in the standard 2oz cans, and have the 
storage problem I mentioned above.</p> 

<p>Norway used to be famous for anchovies, but the canneries have been 
replaced by oil refineries since discovery of North Sea oil.</p>

<p>Very fine anchovies are prepared in various ways in Spain and parts of 
Italy for local consumption. They are served as tapas and snacks in 
bistros and bars throughout Spain. American tourists won't touch them - 
and the Spaniards laugh.</p>

From Roman times anchovies have been salt packed, but are not easily 
available that way in North America. Many chefs insist the salt packed 
are superior, with a meatier flavor and firmer texture. They are whole 
headless fish just as they came from the salt cure barrels, packed in 
5 inch cans with lots of coarse salt salt and a little brine. They need 
to be de-boned, but that's easy. For details see our 
<a href="sf_anchsltz.html"><b>Salted Anchovies</b></a> page.

<p><big><b><big>Anchovy Paste</big></b></big>
<br><img src="img/sf_anchop02d.jpg" alt="Tube of Anchovy Paste" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2">
Anchovy paste, while not considered quite as good as whole anchovy 
fillets, is very convenient, especially for people who don't use a lot 
of anchovies. Once opened it is kept in the refrigerator and will 
probably be good for at least a year. The photo specimen is Roland 
brand from Spain, and is of good quality. Ing: Anchovies, salt, olive oil, 
acetic acid.

Salted and dried anchovies are a very important flavoring item in 
Southeast Asia and Korea, used in many ways.	Japanese Niboshi or Iriko 
are properly juvenile sardines rather than anchovies, but are almost 
always labeled "Anchovies" in English, and are pretty much 
indistinguishable from Anchovies. This important seafood product has 
its own <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_anchodz.html"><b>Dried Anchovies</b></a> page.

</p><p>
The highest grade Fish Sauces are made in Thailand and Vietnam from 
Anchovies and only Anchovies. These sauces are essential to the cuisines 
of most of Southeast Asia, and were also essential to the cuisine of the 
Roman Empire. These sauces are now making inroads into the cuisines of 
North America, especially in California, and are begining to revive in 
Italy. They have their own
