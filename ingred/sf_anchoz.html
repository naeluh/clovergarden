<h1>Anchovy Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_anchoca04g.jpg" alt="Whole California Anchovy 04g" class=mrg>
[family <i>Engraulidae</i>]
<p>
Anchovies are a fairly large family of small schooling fish found in shallow 
coastal waters in temperate regions worldwide. Most members of this family 
are less than 6 inches long, though there are a few giants up to nearly 20 
inches.</p>
<p>Anchovies are very important in the fish food chain and, despite their 
small size, are also very important commercially, mainly as a flavoring 
ingredient. Canned anchovies are used in many recipes but their most important 
use is in production of fermented fish sauce, as essential to the cuisines 
of Southeast Asia as it was to those of Imperial Rome. Anchovies are not 
only canned and made into fish sauce, they are also made into fish meal, 
fish oil, and are heavily used as bait for tuna fishing.</p>

   <h3>Blue Anchovy</h3>

   [<i>Encrasicholina devisi</i>]
   <p>
   This Indo-Pacific fish can grow to just over 3 inches but the photo 
   specimen, shown with a toothpick for scale, was 2-1/2 inches and weighed 
   0.075 ounce (that's over 200 to the pound). They are found in the Persian 
   Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the 
   West-Central Pacific as far southeast as Fiji and as far north as Taiwan.

   <h3>China Anchovy</h3>

   [Gray Anchovy (market); C&aacute; Com Than (Viet); 
   <i>Stolephorus chinensis</i>]
   <p>
   This West Pacific fish can grow to 3.5 inches but the photo 
   specimen was 2-3/4 inches. A tray of 70 weighed 14 ounces, 0.2 ounces 
   each, or 80 to the pound. They are found mainly in the South China Sea, 
   from Borneo north to Taiwan, around the Philippines and west around 
   the Malay Peninsula. Color stripes (wide silver with narrow dark 
   above) is like the Blue Anchovy, but this one is larger with a bigger 
   eye and different shaped face.

   <h3>California Anchovy</h3>

   <img src="img/sf_anchoca04e.jpg" alt="Whole California Anchovy" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Engraulis mordax</i>]
   <p>
   This anchovy is found from the Canadian border to the tip of Baja 
   California. They can grow to 9-3/4 inches and weigh 2.4 ounces, but the photo 
   specimen was 5-3/4 inches and weighed 0.7 ounce. Longer and a bit chunkier 
   than most anchovies, the California anchovy is used mostly for fishmeal and 
   tuna bait, but is also sold fresh here in California, and is just 
   occasionally canned.

   <h3>European Anchovy</h3>
   <br><a href="sf_anchopd.html">
   <img src="img/sf_anchoeu05e.jpg" alt="Whole European Anchovy" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Engraulis  encrasicolus</i>]
   <p>
   European anchovies are found on the west coast of South Africa all 
   the way up to Norway and in the western Mediterranean. Live, they look 
   a lot like the California anchovy but are more slender and elongated, 
   and a bit smaller, growing to just under 9 inches. In Europe they are 
   sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, but are familiar to Americans 
   in cans, mostly from Morocco. I have been disappointed in Moroccan 
   anchovies and purchase South American and Italian anchovies instead. 
   If you have acquired fresh European Anchovies, see our 
   <a href="sf_anchocaz.html"><b>California Anchovies</b></a> page for 
   how to prepare them. For canned, dried and salted, see our 
   <a href="sf_anchopd.html"><b>Anchovy Products</b></a> page.

  <h3>South American Anchovies</h3>
  <br><img src="img/sf_anchopu01e.jpg" alt="Peruvian Anchovy Drawing" class=mrg>
  [Anchovita; <i>Engraulis ringens</i> (Chile, Peru) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
     Argentine Anchovy; <i>Engraulis anchoita</i> (Brazil, Argentina)]
     <p>
  These anchovies look very much like the European and are used similarly. 
  They are found along the coast of Peru and about 2/3 down the coast 
  of Chile, but exact range is dependent on the Peru Current. These fish 
  can grow to nearly 8 inches long, but are commonly around 5-1/2 inches. 
  These are a highly commercial catch, but are IUCN Red Listed LC (Least 
  Concern). Chile and Peru ship canned anchovies to North America which 
  are as good as the Italian and better than Moroccan.</p>
  <p>Argentine anchovies are just a little smaller and are also 
  canned, but I've not seen them here in California. They are native 
  from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, down to about the latitude of the Falkland 
  Islands. They are IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated), but are not 
  considered threatened.

  <h3>White Anchovy</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;
  <br><a href="sf_anchowhz.html">
  <img src="img/sf_anchwht01e.jpg" alt="Whole White Anchovy" class=mrg></a> 
  [species unidentified]
  <p>
  This anchovy was acquired from an Asian market in Los Angeles. There are 
  so many anchovy species that all look almost exactly alike, and as many 
  without photos as with them on Fishbase, I'm not going to try to guess 
  species or range. The photo specimen was 3-1/4 inches long and weighed 
  about 0.1 ounce (10 to the ounce).

  <h3>Japanese Grenadier Anchovy</h3>

  [Etsu, Chousen-etsu (Japan); Ung-o (Korea); Fung mei ue (Cantonese); 
  Chang he ji, Dao ji (Mandarin); Long Tail Anchovy (market);
  <i>Coilia nasus</i>]<p>
  These very large Anchovies (up to nearly 18 inches) are native to the 
  coast of China, from Hong Kong north around the west coast of Korea 
  and down to southwest Japan. This fish is a commercial catch throughout 
  its range, its large size making it an attractive food fish. These are 
  marine fish, but can tolerate fresh water and go as far as 600 miles up 
  the Yangtze river. They are called "grenadier" in common with 
  many other fish with a similar tapered body style.

  <h3>Goldspotted Grenadier Anchovy</h3>
  <br><a href="sf_anchogsz.html">
  <img src="img/sf_anchogs02e.jpg" alt="Whole Goldsptted Grenadier Anchovy" class=mrg></a> 
  [Mandeli, Monangu (India); Mangban (Indonesia); <i>Coilia 
  dussumieri</i>]
  <p>
  Native to the Indo-West Pacific, this is the only species of the 
  Grenadier Anchovies (genus <i>Coilia</i>) that is fished commercially 
  in the region. It ranges along the coast from Bombay, India around to 
  Southeast Asia, and is most prolific in Indonesian waters. It is 
  larger than normal anchovies, up to almost 8 inches long.  Primarily a 
  marine fish, it can tolerate low salinity in estuaries. These fish 
  are called "grenadier" in common with many other fish with a similar 
  tapered body style. It is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated), but is 
  not considered threatened.
