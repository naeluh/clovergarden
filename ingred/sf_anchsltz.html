[European Anchovy; <i>Encrasicholina devisi</i>]
<p>
From Roman times anchovies have been salt packed, but are not easily 
available that way in North America. Many chefs insist the salt packed 
are superior, with a meatier flavor and firmer texture. They are whole 
headless fish just as they came from the salt cure barrels, packed in 
5 inch cans with lots of coarse salt and a little brine. They need 
to be de-boned, but that's easy</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; In North America these may be carried in a 
few gourmet outlets, but are most easily ordered on-line. The photo 
specimens, from Italy, were purchased from JF Distribution for 
2018 US $21.99 including shipping. They came in a 5 inch by 2-1/4 inch 
round plastic can holding 29.9 ounces. Ingred: Anchovies, Salt, Brine.

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep in a cool dry place.  Since I don't use 
them that often, I keep them in the fridge.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This is easy. Don't worry about fragments of 
skin on the outside side, they will do no harm.
<ol>
<li>Carefully remove Anchovy from can and wash to remove the large 
salt crystals.</li>
<li>Pull off the collar bones at the front of the fish, which will also 
remove the pectoral fins.</li>
<li>Pry the backbone loose at the very front of the fish until you can 
get hold of it - then pull it towards the bottom of the fish. It will 
act as a rip cord, slicing the fish open all the way to the tail.</li>
<li>If you wish, you can pull the two sides of the fish away from 
each other and will have the equivalent of two fillets from a can.</li>
