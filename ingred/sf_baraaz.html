[Kuta (Nigeria); <i>Sphyraena afra</i>]
<p>
This predatory fish can be found from just south of Morocco all the way 
around to northern Namibia. It can grow to 80 inches and 100 pounds, but 
is more commonly 40 inches (100 cm). It is a minor commercial fish, caught 
with low-tech fishing gear, Nigeria accounting for most of the catch. This 
fish does not generally present a Ciguatera risk, but being a Mackerel, it 
does still present a <a href="sf_bcudaz.html#safe"><b>Scombroid</b></a> 
risk if mishandled. This fish can take care of itself and is IUNC Red List 
LC (Least Concern).

West Africa is traditionally lacking ice or refrigeration, so most fish 
is Smoke Dried. Fish so processed are very popular in West Africa to flavor 
soups and stews. Small ones are smoked whole and look very fierce, but large 
ones have to be cut up before smoking.  Fortunately, the coast of West Africa 
is not a reef environment, so even large Barracuda should be safe to eat. 
The photo specimen was a chunk 7 inches long and weighing 14-3/4 ounces. It 
was purchased on-line for 2018 US $14.99 / pound.<p></p>
