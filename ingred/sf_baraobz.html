<h1>Obtuse Barracuda</h1>

[C&aacute; Nh&ocirc;ng V&agrave;ng (Viet); <i>Sphyraena obtusata</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; very similar Yellowtail Barracuda <i>Sphyraena 
flavicauda</i>]
<p>
Like other Barracuda, this fish is a fearsome predator with strong jaws 
and sharp teeth, but only attacks smaller prey. It is an Indo-West 
Pacific fish, common from the east coast of Africa and the Red Sea 
through the Pacific islands, possibly as far as Hawaii, and from Japan 
all around Australia. The Yellowtail Barracuda has a similar but 
slightly more restricted range.</p>
 
<p>Obtuse Barracuda can grow to almost 22 inches, but is commonly 12 
inches. Yellowtail Barracuda can grow to almost 24 inches, but is 
commonly less than 16 inches. Both these fish are harvested commercially, 
and are both IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated). These small Barracuda 
are not considered a Ciguatera risk, but if not properly handled they 
can present a Scombroid (Histamine) risk. For more on this subject see

<p>The flesh of this fish is light in color and medium in taste. 
There is a very dark strip down the centerline just under the skin, 
with a considerably darker flavor, but it is not unpleasant. Barracuda 
should be kept refrigerated and eaten as soon as practical after 
thawing. Like other Barracuda, if improperly handled it can cause 
histamine poisoning. For details see our 
<a href="sf_bcudaz.html#safe"><b>Health &amp; Safety</b></a> notes.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Because of its small size, this fish offers 
somewhat restricted cooking choices. It can be filleted, but skinning 
is not practical as the skin is what's holding the very tender fillet 
together. Fortunately the skin has only moderate shrink, so both fillets 
and pan dressed fish can be poached or fried. </p>

<p>I prefer this fish fried, rather than poached. For frying, you will 
need at least a light powdering of rice flour on either fillets or pan 
dressed fish to prevent sticking. For pan dressed I also dust the 
inside of the cavity. Fillets should be fried almost through skin side 
up, then turned over to finish. For Pan Dressed, fry well on one side, 
then turn to the other side for about the same time. The body cavity 
will probably be wide open, so I then turn it cavity side down for a 
couple of minutes, and generally plate it in that position.</p>

<p><b>Eating:</b> &nbsp; For Pan Dressed, the first thing to do 
is to pull out both dorsal fins. If the fish is fully cooked, they will 
come out without effort. I eat fish with pointy chop sticks, which allows 
me to break the fish up easily, and will reveal most pin bones that may 
be in the flesh so they can be pulled. Some will escape and have to be 
removed from the mouth. In Victorian England, fish bones were the only 
thing you were allowed to remove from your mouth without being banished 
from polite society.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I have found Obtuse Barracuda in the frozen 
cases of a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Hawaii Supermarket,  
Alhambra). They were about 10 fish to a plastic bag, product of 
Vietnam - 2 pound bag for 2019 US $3.99.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b>&nbsp; This fish is almost completely covered with small 
scales with moderate adhesion. The skin is tough, so they can be scraped 
off vigorously.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The body cavity is long, extending a little 
behind the vent. I recommend this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the head with kitchen shears, cutting behind the pectoral 
  fins and forward of the pelvic fins.</li>
<li>Cut off the pair of pelvic fins with the shears.</li>
<li>With your filleting knife held sharp edge out, insert where the 
  pelvic fins were and cut through the skin all they way back past 
  one side of the anal fin. Now it is easy to make a short cut on 
  the other side of the anal fin and just pull it out.</li>
<li>Pull out all the innards. They come out easily, including the 
  blood works between the swim bladder and the backbone. You can 
  now go on to fillet the fish, or do the next step for pan dressing.
  </li>
<li>For Pan Dressing: &nbsp; I take long nose pliers and insert the 
  point just under the internal membrane next to the backbone and pull 
  out all the thin ribs, a couple at a time, for the length of the body 
  cavity. The tiny centerline pin bones will be hard to find and 
  need to be dealt with on the plate.</li>
  </ol>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not a particularly difficult fish to 
fillet, but there is very little to guide you between the top and the 
backbone, so cut carefully. Handle the fillet gently because it is very 
tender and prone to coming apart. Cut down to the backbone, then over 
the backbone at the tail and work forward. When you get to the rib cage, 
cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers - they pull easily. There are a few 
sharp centerline pin bones, but they are not hard to find in the soft 
flesh. Use long nose pliers and pull then straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin doesn't have a strong or "off" flavor, 
and has moderate shrink. It is pretty much impossible to remove, even 
from fillets, because it's what's holding the fillet together.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3-3/8 ounce fish yielded 1-3/4 ounces skin-on 
fillets (52%). I did not get a skin-off weight because the skin is what's 
holding the fillet together. You'll get slightly more yield from a pan 
dressed fish. </p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; I did not evaluate this, because even 10 fish 
didn't leave much to simmer, especially since I used most of these fish 
pan dressed.</p>
