<h1>Pacific Barracuda</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_bcudap15b.jpg" alt="Whole Pacific Barracuda" class=mrg>
[<i>Sphyraena argentea</i>]
<p>
This very elongated fish is a fearsome predator with strong jaws and 
sharp teeth, but very rarely attacks swimmers. It is found only in the 
the eastern Pacific, from Alaska to the southern tip of Baja California. 
Mexico, but is rare north of Point Conception in Southern California, 
It can grow to almost 60 inches and 26 pounds, but the photo specimen 
was 42-1/2 inches long and weigh 8-1/3 pounds. The Great Barracuda 
of the Atlantic (<i>Sphyraena barracuda</i>) can get up to 72 inches 
and 100 pounds. Pacific Barracuda can fend for themselves and are 
IUNC Red List LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p>The Pacific Barracuda, properly handled, is safe to eat, as it does 
not live in a reef environment. Barracuda from other regions, like 
Florida, the Indian Ocean, Hawaii and northern Australia can be highly 
toxic. For more on this subject see <a href="sf_bcudaz.html#safe">

<p>The notes here apply specifically to Pacific Barracuda (<i>Sphyraena 
argentea</i>) but should be generally applicable to other barracuda, 
but pay careful attention to the <a href="sf_bcudaz.html#safe">
<b>Health &amp; Safety</b></a> notes. The flesh of this fish is light 
in color, and light medium in taste, with a quite pleasant flavor. There 
is a very dark strip down the centerline just under the skin, with a 
considerably darker flavor, but it is not unpleasant. Barracuda should 
be kept well chilled at all times and eaten as soon as practical. While 
Pacific Barracuda is not a Ciguatera risk like some other Barracuda, if 
improperly handled can cause histamine poisoning. For details see our 
<a href="sf_bcudaz.html#safe"><b>Health &amp; Safety</b></a> notes.
</p>

<p>Skinned fillets can be cooked by just about any suitable method. The 
flesh stays quite firm in wet cooking, even with extended simmering, 
so this is a very good fish for soups and stews.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These fish are fairly common in the Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles. The photo specimen was purchased from a Philippine 
market at 2014 US $1.99 / pound. They are best purchased soon after they 
are put out on ice, usually Saturday morning.</p>
<p><b>Scales:</b>&nbsp; This fish doesn't have a lot of scales, and 
most of the ones it does have are up near the head. They are small with 
light adhesion, so scrape off easily with very little flying about.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The body cavity is very long, and there's a 
fair amount of stuff in it, particularly a very long double swim bladder. 
Between the swim bladder and the backbone is a fair amount of blood 
works, mostly contained within membranes, so fairly easy to pull out 
with your long nose pliers. The gills are large and pull very hard, but 
if you don't expect to make stock, you needn't pull them. Otherwise cut 
them loose with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not a particularly difficult fish to 
fillet, but there is very little to guide you between the top and the 
backbone, so cut carefully.  Handle the fillet gently because it is very 
tender and prone to coming apart. When you get to the rib cage, cut the 
ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet 
with long nose pliers - they are few and pull easily. There are quite a 
few long sharp centerline pin bones, but they are not hard to find in the 
soft flesh. Use long nose pliers and grasp them in the middle, because 
the big end breaks off easily - pull straight forward. In particular, 
check the top point at the front of the fillet for tiny bones.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin doesn't have a strong or "off" flavor, 
but it shrinks fiercely, so needs to be removed for any form of cooking. 
It is quite tough, so is not difficult to remove using the standard 
<b><a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a></b>. I have skinned full length 
fillets successfully.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; An 8 pound 5 ounce fish yielded 4 pounds 10 
ounces of skin-on fillet (56%) and 4 pounds 1-1/2 oz skin-off (49%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins of the photo specimen 
made a serviceable stock, a little stronger than some but not at all 
unpleasant (I did not use the skins). Don't simmer more than 40 minutes 
for best results 
(see <b><a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">Method</a></b>). If the 
barracuda is not so fresh, results may not be so good.</p>
