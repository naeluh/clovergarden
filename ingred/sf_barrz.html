This Indo-Pacific fish is very important in Southeast Asia and northern 
Australia, and also much appreciated in West Bengal and Bangladesh. 
Both wild and farmed, it is a sought after fish that fetches 
a premium price. It can grow to 78 inches and 132 pounds, but the 
photo specimen was 17 inches long, weighed 2 pounds 14 ounces. It 
probably came from a fish farm in Thailand, but a growing number 
are farmed in North America. They are also farmed in Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Australia, with smaller operations in the UK and Holland.

<p>Barramundi is a very fine eating fish, with delicate flesh and 
delicate flavor. Saltwater caught or farmed is considered best because 
river caught may have a lot of fat.  You should not use strongly flavored 
sauces with this fish as they would swamp its delicate flavor - enjoy it 
as natural as possible and cooked a very short time.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; At the time of writing (early 2010) this fish 
has become fairly common in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles, often 
labeled "Giant Perch" - and surprise! It actually is a perch. While the 
fish in the photo was purchased in 2010, a smaller one (2 pounds) I 
purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock, actually) 
was 2015 US $3.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Barramundi is completely covered with large 
strong scales with good adhesion so it takes a bit of energy to scrape 
them off and they will fly about everywhere. By time I've scaled a couple 
of big ones I'm so covered with scales I look like a fish. Some clumps of 
scales, particularly just behind the head, will be stubborn, but you can 
pull the clumps off with your long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Barramundi is more difficult than some fish 
because there's a lot of stuff in there and some of it adheres tightly to 
the bone structure. Use long nose pliers for what you can't pull easily 
by hand, and you'll want to cut the gills out with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Barramundi is pretty easy to fillet, but there 
is a large gap between the fin rays and the short ribs coming up from the 
backbone so be careful you knife stays on the right side of them. When 
you get to the rib cage, the ribs are unusually easy to follow and with 
care you can fillet right off the ends of the ribs keeping the skirt 
fully attached. You will still get a little more flesh, though, if you 
cut the ribs from the backbone and pull them from the fillet with your 
long nose pliers. The skirt is fairly fleshy on this fish. There are 
no noticeable centerline pin bones to pull on this fish. Yield is very 
good with a 2 pound 14 ounce fish yielding 1 pound 8-1/4 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (52%) or 9-1/2 ounces skinless (48%). A smaller fish will 
yield a few percent less.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp;  Barramundi skin has a stronger flavor than the 
flesh but not by a lot, and it shrinks very little when fried - it 
softens before it can shrink. There is no reason to skin fillets to be 
fried. The skin adheres tightly but is quite tough so it's an easy fish 
to skin using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. You can use a fairly steep 
angle with the knife so almost no flesh is taken. </p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Fillets of this fish are excellent for frying 
and can be fried skin-on because the skin softens before it shrinks and 
won't curl the fillet. You must dust fillets with a light coating of rice 
flour or similar or the skin will instantly stick to the pan and make a 
mess.</p>

<p>Other suitable cooking methods are steaming, broiling and baking but 
keep in mind the flesh is tender and flakes apart very easily so it can't 
stand rough handling. Fillets of smaller fish, up to about 1-1/2 pounds, 
hold together well enough to be poached. The skin is so well behaved you 
could actually poach fillets skin-on, but that usually isn't done. If you 
poach a whole fish, the skin can easily be peeled off before serving if 
you so desire.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Heads, bones and fins make a very fine light fish 
stock without strong or off flavors - one of the best 
(<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">Method</a>). There will be a very 
modest amount of oil which you should remove using your gravy separator.
