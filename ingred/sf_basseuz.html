[Branzino (Italy, Restaurants); <i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>]
<p>
This Seabass is native to Western Europe and northwestern Africa. 
It is common along the north coast of Norway, in the North Sea, 
around the British Isles, southern Iceland, and the Atlantic coasts of 
France, Spain, Morocco and Senegal. It is reasonably common in the 
Western Mediterranean and the north Adriatic, but relatively scarce 
in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is moderately common in the Black Sea.
</p> 
<p>This fish can grow to 40 inches and 26 pounds, but is typically 20 
inches. The photo specimen, farm raised in Turkey, was 13-1/4 inches 
long and weighed 14 ounces. This fish is IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

<p>European Seabass is and excellent mild eating fish. In North America 
it is served in expensive restaurants as "Branzino", because any 
chef worth his toque knows, he can get three times the price than if 
he calls it "Bass". It is often served whole on an oval plate with 
artistically applied garnishes.</p>

<p>The flesh is light in color, light in flavor without being bland, 
and tender. It doesn't really flake apart, rather it just breaks up 
almost randomly. The flesh is almost white with a wide thin darker 
layer just under the skin. This darker layer is only slightly stronger 
in taste, and so thin it is not a significant factor.</p>

<p>Though fillets (skin off) can withstand a short poaching, this fish 
is not otherwise suitable for wet cooking - it will quickly disintegrate. 
The most usual ways to prepare this fish are grilled, pan roasted or 
steamed - whole or pan dressed. It is often stuffed with lemons and 
herbs. Fillets can also be pan fried skin-on or skin-off. I prefer 
skin-on as the skin contributes a bit of texture and flavor.</p>

<p>For any of the above methods (except fillets), the skin should have 
shallow, diagonal gashes so it does not tear. The gashes will open 
some, but not unattractively.</p>

<p>When frying skin-on fillets, you definitely want at least a light 
powdering of rice flour to prevent sticking to the pan and to keep the 
skin in place. Once it's been heated the skin has almost no grip on the 
flesh and will otherwise peel right off and make a mess. Pan fry skin 
side up until the fillet is stiffened, then flip it skin side down to 
finish.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish has recently become available in the 
Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles. Restaurants buy such fish 
directly from fish wholesalers, who don't sell to public markets until 
they have more than the restaurants can buy. This is a premium priced 
fish. the photo specimen was purchased as "Branzino" from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2018 US $5.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with medium 
size scales with good adhesion, so they take a little effort to scrape 
off, but they don't fly around a lot.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to clean, but there 
is a swim bladder and some internal membranes that are a bit tough. Some 
of the innards are difficult to pull out until you pull the gills. The 
gills are in fairly hard, so use your long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet, having an 
orderly bone structure to follow. Make cuts over the tail and on the 
underside from tail to body cavity. Cut from front to back down to the 
backbone on both sides, then hop over the backbone at the tail and work 
forward to the rib cage. Cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen 
shears and pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers - they pull 
easily taking little flesh. There are some centerline pin bones to be 
pulled out straight forward for half the length of the body cavity, 
and one short one at the front of the skirt.</p>

<p><b>Skin: </b> &nbsp; The skin has flavor a little stronger than the 
flesh, but not much, so it can be tossed in the pot with the bones, 
heads and fins for fish stock. Shrink is moderate, but enough to curl a 
fillet in the frying pan. You can fry fillets skin-on if you dust them 
lightly with rice flour. First fry skin side up, then turn the fillets 
over and press them flat with your turner until the skin looses its 
grip, just a few seconds. The skin can be left on for most suitable 
forms of cooking, but not for poaching fillets. Fillets can be skinned 
quite easily by the long knife and cutting board

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 14-3/4 ounce 13-1/2 inch fish yielded 7-1/2 
ounces of fillet skin-on (51%) and 6.6 ounces with the skin removed 
(45%). Smaller fish may yield a little less.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones, fins and any removed skins 
make a pleasant, usable, almost clear fish stock with little oil, but 
do remove what oil there is using your gravy separator. For details

Stock</b></a>.</p>
