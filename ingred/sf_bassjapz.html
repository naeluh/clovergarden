[Japanese Seaperch; Seigo (Japan - under 10 inches), Fukko, Suzuki (Japan - 
  above 20 inches); Ca Vuroc Nhat (Vietnam); Lu yu, Hua lu (China); Nong-o 
  (Korea); <i>Lateolabrax japonicus</i>]
<p>
This fish is found from the north coast of Vietnam north around Korea 
to the southeast tip of Russia. Also around Japan and along the west 
coast of Taiwan, but not in the  Philippines. Japanese Seabass can 
grow to 40 inches and 19 pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-3/4 
inches and weighed 2 pounds 1-1/4 ounces. This fish is both caught 
wild and farmed. IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated), it is not 
considered endangered.</p>

<p>Japanese Seabass flesh is white, mild flavored and tender, flaking 
apart very easily into large flakes. In Japan it is often eaten raw, 
sliced very thin and served with ponzu sauce or ponzu with light soy.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This is not a good fish for wet cooking, as 
it starts to fall apart even with a light poaching. Coating lightly 
with rice flour and pan frying will work fine, as will baking.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish occasionally appears in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, but rarely. The Japanese market probably takes most 
of them.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with small scales 
with moderate adhesion. They fly about moderately when scraped off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp; No unusual problems here.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp;  This is an easy fish to fillet with an easy to 
follow bone structure. Cut down from the top to the backbone, then over the 
backbone at the tail until you get to the rib cage. Cut the ribs off with 
kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet - they pull very easily. There 
are no significant centerline spines that need to be pulled.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 2 pound 1-1/4 ounce fish yielded 15-3/4 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (47%) and 14-3/4 ounces skin-off (44%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor. It has 
moderate shrink but soon releases from the fillet. Skin-on fillets can be 
pan fried successfully lightly dusted with rice flour. When turned skin side 
down the fillet will curl a bit but within a few seconds can be patted flat 
with your turner.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads (well cleaned and split), bones and fins 
simmered slowly for about 40 minutes make a light flavored, nearly clear and 
serviceable stock with little oil. Remove what oil there is using your 
gravy separator.</p>
