<p>
These famous fresh water bass, native to North America, are not 
actually bass at all but a variety of Sunfish. This fish can grow to 38 
inches and 22 pounds, but is more commonly around 16 inches. The photo 
specimen was a 13 inch Largemouth Bass weighing 1-1/2 pounds. Largemouth  
Bass is now heavily farmed and is not considered threatened, but it 
can become a pest in non-native waters.</p>

<p>These fish has very delicate white flesh of a mild flavor.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Largemouth Bass is now heavily farmed and is 
almost always available in the Asian fish markets. Due to confusion 
between the two fish, Asian markets here in Los Angeles label the fish 
"Mouth Bass".</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; These fish fillet easily with no residual bones.
</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1-1/2 pound fish will yield about 12 oz of 
skin-on filets (50%) or 10 oz skin off (42%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin does not shrink at all in frying, but 
you may want to remove it because of the very delicate flavor of the 
white flesh.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a very mild fish 
stock suitable for soup.</p>
