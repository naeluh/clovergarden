<h1>Sand Bass</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_basssand15g.jpg" alt="Whole Gold Spotted Sand Bass" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Serranidae (Sea Basses) Paralabrax sp.</i>]
<p>
Several varieties of Sand Bass are found in Southern California waters: 
Goldspotted (<i>P. auroguttatus</i>), Barred (<i>P.nebulifer</i>), 
Spotted (<i>P. maculatofasciatus</i>). The Goldspotted is the only one 
much seen in markets here in Los Angeles, but the others are about the 
same as far as cooking is concerned. The Goldspotted is fished mainly 
in the Gulf of California. It can grow to 28 inches and 6 pounds, but 
the photo specimen, caught wild in Mexican waters, was 15 inches long 
and weighed a 1 pound 10 ounces. I have purchased them up to a little 
over 4 pounds.

<p>The flesh of Sand Bass is mild and light, and contains very little oil. 
The darker layer right under the skin has an only slightly stronger taste 
but not at all distracting. The only negative for this fish is the 
limited number of ways it can be cooked.</p>

<p>The flesh is very tender and doesn't hold up well to wet cooking. 
It tends to break apart at random points rather than neatly along the 
flake margins. Whole fish are not so good for steaming or baking because 
the skin becomes very soft and may not look good. It is best to either 
dust fillets with rice flour and pan fry them, or cut them in half 
crosswise and poach them gently.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with small scales 
that have fairly good adhesion. They aren't hard to scrape off but do fly 
around a bit. Some will capsize rather than scrape off so some patches 
will have to be shaved off with the sharp edge of the knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Cleaning presents no unusual problems, but you 
will want to use kitchen shears to cut the throat from the head and cut 
out the gill arches, which are rather hard to pull. The swim bladder 
and other membranes don't pull easily, so a sturdy pair of long nose 
pliers is very helpful.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Sand Bass is an easy fish to fillet because it 
has a very coherent bone structure. It's best 
to start by removing the head, then cut through the skin to outline the 
fillet top and bottom. Working from head to tail cut down to the backbone, 
then go over the backbone at the tail and work forward until you get to 
the body cavity. Cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and 
pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers - they pull easily taking 
little flesh. There are nasty centerline pin bones for the length of the 
body cavity. Feel for them and pull them out straight forward with the 
pliers.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; This is a big headed fish so yield is not spectacular, 
but better than many fish. A 1 pound 10 ounce fish yielded 11-3/4 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (45%) and 10-3/4 ounces skin-off (41%). With the 
thin skirt removed it was 9-5/8 ounces (37%). A larger fish will 
yield a little higher.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" taste, but it 
shrinks sharply when heated - then becomes very soft. When frying 
skin-on it must be well coated with rice flour or some other flour or 
it will stick to the pan and make a mess. The skin is rather tough, so 
can be easily removed easily using the standard long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads, bones and fins, simmered very gently 
for no more than 40 minutes, make a serviceable stock with an 
interesting flavor. Not "stock lite", but quite usable. Remove all oil 
using your gravy separator. For details 
see our recipe <a href="../recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
Stock</b></a>.</p>
