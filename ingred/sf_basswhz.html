[Freshwater Bass; <i>Morone chrysops</i>]
<p>
Native to the rivers of North America, this bass looks a lot like the 
Striped Bass, but it inhabits only fresh water and does not venture to 
sea. These fish can grow to almost 18 inches and 6-3/4 pounds but the 
one in the photo was 13-1/4 inches and weighed 1 pound 6 ounces, a little 
larger than the average market size. This fish is now farmed on an 
experimental basis and is not listed as threatened.</p>

<p>This fish can be filleted and pan fried, pan fried whole or pan 
dressed, steamed, baked, grilled, or poached whole. It is not a good 
fish for soups or stews as it falls apart with wet cooking. When steamed 
with the usual slashes, skin shrink opens the slashes some but not so 
much as to be unattractive. The flesh is off white with a thin somewhat 
darker layer just under the skin. It has a pleasant flavor by any 
means of cooking.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish can often be found in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, sometimes for as little as 2010 US $1.29 / pound. 
Of course that's a "no cut, no clean" price, so it's all up to the 
purchaser.  Though it is easy to confuse this fish with the saltwater 
<a href="sf_bassstz.html"><b>Striped Bass</b></a>, getting the wrong 
one isn't a big problem as they are much alike.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The scales on this fish are medium size and scrape 
off quite easily with only moderate flying about. There are no particular 
problems gutting this fish, and the gills pull out fairly easily, but 
you may want to use kitchen shears to cut them loose at the bottom end. 
This is an easy fish to fillet. When you get to the rib cage just cut the 
ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet 
with long nose pliers - they pull fairly easily.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has modest shrink, but enough to curl a 
fillet in a frying pan. If you press the fillet back flat with your turner 
the skin quickly looses its grip and the fillet will continue to fry flat. 
Fillets can be skinned quite easily with the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but it does not have a strong or 
unpleasant flavor, so can be left on for most forms of cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 5-5/8 ounce fish yielded 9-7/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (46%) and 8-1/2 ounces skin off (39%).<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a pleasant usable 
fish stock with moderate oil. Separate the oil using your gravy separator 
before use. For details See
