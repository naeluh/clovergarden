<h1>Bass Family</h1>

[Family <i>Moronidae</i> (temperate basses)]
<p>
"Bass" is a popular name applied to many fish that aren't really bass, 
but people call them "Bass" anyway, particularly the Black Bass 
(Smallmouth and Largemouth). Shown here are the real bass (even though 
one of them is called "Perch"), with links to some of the "not actually 
a bass" fish.<br class=cll></p>

   [<i>Paralabrax</i> species.]
   <p>
   The several varieties of Sand Bass available in Southern California, 
   Barred (<i>P.nebulifer</i>), Spotted (<i>P. maculatofasciatus</i>), 
   Goldspotted (<i>P. auroguttatus</i>), are all about the same as far 
   as cooking is concerned. The Goldspotted is the only one much seen in 
   markets here in Los Angeles, and is fished mainly in the Gulf of 
   California. It can grow to 28 inches and 6 pounds, but the photo 
   specimen, caught wild in Mexican waters, was 15 inches long and 
   weighed a 1 pound 10 ounces. I have purchased them up to a little 
   over 4 pounds.

   <h2>European Seabass</h2>

   <img src="img/sf_basseu02e.jpg" alt="Whole European Bass" class=mrg></a>
   [Branzino (Italy, Restaurants); <i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>]
   <p>
   This Seabass is native to Western Europe and northwestern Africa. 
   It is common along the north coast of Norway, in the North Sea, 
   around the British Isles, southern Iceland, and the Atlantic coasts of 
   France, Spain, Morocco and Senegal. It is reasonably common in the 
   Western Mediterranean and the north Adriatic, but relatively scarce 
   in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is moderately common in the Black Sea.

   <img src="img/sf_bassst13e.jpg" alt="Whole Striped Bass 13e" class=mrg></a>
   [Striped Sea-bass, <i>Morone saxatilis</i>]
   <p>
   This sea bass is found mainly in river estuaries from the Gulf Coast of 
   the U.S. up the Western Atlantic coast into Canada and there are some 
   landlocked populations. It has been introduced to other countries and 
   is now farmed commercially. These fish can grow to 78 inches and 125 
   pounds but the one in the photo was 15-1/2 inches and weighed 1-3/4 
   pounds, a typical market size. This fish renews its population fairly 
   quickly, is not listed as threatened and is now being farmed.

   <img src="img/sf_basswht04e.jpg" alt="Whole White Bass 04e" class=mrg></a>
   [<i>Morone chrysops</i>]
   <p>
   Native to the rivers of North America, this bass looks a lot like the 
   Striped Bass, but it inhabits only fresh water and does not venture to 
   sea. These fish can grow to almost 18 inches and 
   6-3/4 pounds but the one in the photo was 13-1/4 inches and weighed 
   1 pound 6 ounces, a little larger than the average market size. This 
   fish is now farmed on an experimental basis and is not listed as 
   threatened.

   [<i>Morone americana</i>]
   <p>
   Not actually a Perch but a Bass, this fish is native to the North Atlantic 
   coast, living in salt, brackish and fresh water, and is an invasive species 
   in the Great Lakes. It is a good eating fish and can be cooked in various 
   ways. The White Perch is not considered threatened, in fact it is 
   considered a nuisance in some areas. It can grow to a little over 19 
   inches and 4-3/4 pounds, but the photo specimen was 10 inches long and 
   weighed 11 ounces, toward the high end of typical market size.

<h2 class=lrg>Asian Seabasses</h2>
<p>[Family <i>Lateolabracidae</i>; Genera <i>Lateolabrax</i>. These were 
formerly included in the Temperate Basses, genus <i>Morone</i>, but are

   <p>
   This fish is found from the north coast of Vietnam north around Korea 
   to the southeast tip of Russia. Also around Japan and along the west 
   coast of Taiwan, but not in the  Philippines. Japanese Seabass can 
   grow to 40 inches and 19 pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-3/4 
   inches and weighed 2 pounds 1-1/4 ounces. This fish is both caught 
   wild and farmed. IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated), it is not 
   considered endangered.
