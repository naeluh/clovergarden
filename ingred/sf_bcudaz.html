<h1>Barracuda Family</h1>

[family <i>Sphyraenus</i>]
<p>
These very elongated fish are fearsome predators, with strong jaws and 
sharp teeth, but very rarely attacks swimmers. They are found mostly in 
tropical and subtropical seas. The photo is of a Pacific Barracuda 
(<i>Sphyraena argentea</i>) which can grow to almost 60 inches and 26 
pounds, but the Great Barracuda (<i>Sphyraena barracuda</i>) of the 
Atlantic can get up to 72 inches and 100 pounds.
<br><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Barracuda can be 
<a href="seafish.html#cigu"><b><u>highly</u> <u>toxic</u></b></a> in 
tropical reef areas like Florida, the Indian Ocean, Hawaii and northern 
Australia. Pacific Barracuda (<i>S. argentea</i>) is generally safe, as 
is the European Barracuda.</p>

<h2>Pacific Barracuda</h2>

<img src="img/sf_bcudap15d.jpg" alt="Whole Pacific Barracuda" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Sphyraena argentea</i>]
<p>
This fish is found only in the the eastern Pacific, from Alaska to the 
southern tip of Baja California, Mexico, but is rare north of Point 
Conception in Southern California, It can grow to almost 60 inches and 
26 pounds, but the photo spcimen was 42-1/2 inches long and weigh 8-1/3 
pounds. This Barracuda is very rarely a Ciguatera risk as it doesn't hang 
out around reefs.

<h2>European Barracuda</h2>
<br><a href="sf_baraez.html">

[Mediterranean barracuda; Barracuda de M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e (French); 
<i>Sphyraena sphyraena</i>]
<p>
This predatory fish can be found from northern Spain, through the 
Mediterranean and Black Sea, and down the west coast of Africa to Angola. 
A few have been reported from Bermuda and Brazil. It can grow to 65 inches 
(165 cm) and 26 pounds (12 kg) but is commonly 24 inches (60 cm). It is a 
minor commercial catch in the region, and does not present a Ciguatera risk. 
This fish can take care of itself and is IUNC Red List LC (Least Concern).

[Kuta (Nigeria); <i>Sphyraena afra</i>]
<p>
This predatory fish can be found from just south of Morocco all the way 
around to northern Namibia. It can grow to 80 inches and 100 pounds, but 
is more commonly 40 inches (100 cm). It is a minor commercial fish, caught 
with low-tech fishing gear, Nigeria accounting for most of the catch.

[C&aacute; Nh&ocirc;ng V&agrave;ng (Viet); <i>Sphyraena obtusata</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; very similar Yellowtail Barracuda <i>Sphyraena 
flavicauda</i>]
<p>
Like other Barracuda, these fish are fearsome predators with strong jaws 
and sharp teeth, but are small (usually less than 16 inches) and only 
attack smaller prey. These are Indo-West Pacific fish. The Obtuse is 
common from the east coast of Africa and the Red Sea through the Pacific 
islands, possibly as far as Hawaii, and from Japan all around Australia. 
The Yellowtail has a similar but slightly more restricted range. Both 
these fish are harvested commercially, and are both IUCN Red List 
NE (Not Evaluated). These small Barracuda are not considered a 
Ciguatera risk.

<h3>Ciguatera:</h3> &nbsp; For Barracuda that live in tropical reef regions,  
mind the warnings about toxins. For details see <a href="seafish.html#cigu">
<b>Ciguatera Poisoning</b></a>. Some fishermen in Central America say small 
(18 inches or so) fish are safe. In Florida some fishermen flop small 
barracuda on the dock, if flies settle on it it's OK, otherwise not (large 
barracuda are always toxic there). In some Central American countries ants 
are used for the same purpose. I have no idea if any of these tests are 
effective. Pacific Barracuda (<i>S. argentea</i> - photo) from the west coast 
of North America is generally considered safe (no reef environment here), 
and the same for European Barracuda.<p></p>

<h3>Scombroid:</h3> &nbsp; Like other fish in the Mackerel Family, Barracuda 
contain the amino acid Histidine, which bacteria convert to Histamine if the 
fish is not not properly handled. It should be iced as soon as it is caught 
and kept refrigerated until cooked. Scombroid is not usually as serious as 
Ciguatera, except for persons allergic to bee and wasp stings. An overload 
of histamines causes tingling of the lips and mouth, skin rashes, vomiting 
and other symptoms. Even untreated, the symptoms are usually gone within 
12 hours, but persons with bee and wasp sting allergies should be 
immediately treated with antihistamines.<p></p>
