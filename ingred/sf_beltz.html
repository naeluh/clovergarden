[Largehead Hairtail (FishBase), Ribbonfish, Cutlassfish, Scabbardfish; 
Kalchi (Korea,  lit. "Sword fish"); Tachiuo (Japan, lit. "Sword fish"); 
Peixe-espada (Brazil, Portugal, lit "Sword fish"); 
<i>Trichiurus lepturus</i>]
<p>
This fish is found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, usually 
not far from the coast. It can grow to over 7-1/2 feet long and 11 
pounds, but the photo specimen was a mere 34-1/2 inches long, weighing 
1 pound 3/4 ounce. This is a highly commercial fish, primarily for Asian 
markets, so it is very common here in Los Angeles. It is also popular 
in Brazil, Portugal, Italy and Pakistan. Beltfish have no scales and 
make no effort whatever to be kosher.</p>

<h2>Espada</h2>

Beltfish is one of the many small fish that are salted and dried in the 
Philippines, categorically called 
"<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_daingz.html"><b>Daing</b></a>". The larger of the photo 
specimens was 19-1/4 inches long and weighted 1-1/2 ounces.  It was 
purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $2.99 for 
3-5/8 ounces, or $13.20 / pound.

<p>Beltfish is popular for grilling, pan frying, deep frying and stir 
frying - all dry, high heat, short cooking time methods, because it 
becomes mushy with long or wet cooking. The flesh is medium flavored and 
low in oil. It may be cooked as fillets, or as cut sections of the fish 
to be deboned on the plate.</p>

<p>In Japan it is also eaten raw as sushi or sashimi, usually 
served with ponzu rather than soy sauce. It may be lightly grilled so 
it has a crust but is still raw inside.</p>

<p>Another popular method is to make fillets into rolls. For this, 
fillets are cut to about 2 inch lengths, rolled around a filling and 
pined with toothpicks to keep skin shrink from unrolling them. The 
filling must then jell to hold it together because the skin will quickly 
soften.</p>

<p>In India, Indonesia, Philippines and some Pacific islands, this fish 
is usually salted and sun dried, after which it may be used in curries.
</p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Beltfish can be found in just about any of the 
Asian fish markets here in Southern California, both whole on ice, and 
in the frozen cases cleaned and cut to size for rolls. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock, 
actually) for 2016 US $3.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This might seem a bit daunting for a fish over 
three feet long, but it's not that hard. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: &nbsp; 
Because of its shape, this fish finds it hard to stay upright, so you may  
find a few bony counter weights along the bottom of the fish. 
These are normal.
<ol>
<li>Make a cut from the vent (near the middle of the fish) all the way 
up under the jaw. Remove all the innards and membranes, and scrape out 
the blood works between the swim bladder and backbone.</li> 
<li>Remove the head with the usual cuts around the collar and cut the 
backbone with kitchen shears.</li>
<li>Outline your fillet with shallow cuts through the skin all along the 
top, and from tail to body cavity on each side of the anal fin, which is 
reduced to just a stiff ridge on this fish.</li>
<li>Starting at the head end use your filleting knife to cut down to the 
backbone all the way to the tail carefully following the fins and bones. 
You may find it better to do this in a couple passes.</li>
<li>Dip over the backbone at the tail and follow the bones to the end of 
the body cavity, meeting the shallow cut you made at the bottom.</li>
<li>Starting from the head end dip over the backbone and follow the ribs 
on down (they rake sharply aft). Don't try to pull the fillet off the 
ribs, you'll lose flesh. For fish smaller than 3 feet this may not work 
perfectly.</li>
<li>Once the fillet is free, check it for any ribs or partial ribs, pull 
off any remaining membranes and rinse.</li>
<li><u>Do not attempt</u> to remove the skin - it's what's holding the 
fillet together.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp;  A 1 pound 3/4 ounce fish yielded 9-1/8 ounces 
of fillet (54%), but smaller fish will yield a slightly lower percentage.
<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin shrinks significantly but is weak and 
quickly softens.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Stock made from beltfish heads and bones is rather 
"fishy" and I don't recommend it.<p></p>
