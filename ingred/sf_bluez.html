<i>Pomatomus saltatrix</i>]
<p>
This fish is found in tropical and subtropical waters all around 
the world, except the northern, central and eastern Pacific Ocean. I 
don't know what it has against the Pacific, but it doesn't live 
there. It can grow to 51 inches and 31 pounds but the photo specimen was 
16-1/4 inches and weighed 1.5 pounds.</p>
<p>Bluefish is the only member of family <i>Pomatomidae</i>. It had a 
near relative off the coast of Southern California, but that fish has 
been extinct for 5 million years. Bluefish is a voracious eater and 
apparently kills more fish than it can eat. It is fierce when caught and 
often bites (its teeth are really sharp). This fish has been overfished, 
but controls have restored populations off North America and some other 
regions.  Considered a good eating fish, it's a highly commercial catch 
in some regions, particularly Turkey and Brazil, and is now being farmed.

large page).

<p>Bluefish flesh is a medium color and distinctly flavored but not nearly 
as strong as mackerel. There is a narrow dark strip down the centerline of 
the fillet which has a stronger flavor but that can easily be removed if 
your taste in fish is, umm . . . "refined".</p>

<p>Fillets can be cooked by any method and hold together well but flake 
apart easily on the plate. The flesh is very tender when raw but cooks up 
quite firm, though not objectionably firm. I consider this an excellent 
eating fish.</p>

<p>I particularly like fillets lightly dusted with rice flour and pan 
fried in a neutral flavored oil. This fish has sufficient flavor not to 
be overwhelmed by this method of cooking.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish sometimes appears in the Asian 
fish markets here in Los Angeles. It's not a fish you can just go out 
and buy, it's a fish you buy when you see it.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with smallish and rather 
thin scales that are easy to scrape off and don't fly around much as 
you do so.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Bluefish is fairly easy to fillet with a bone 
structure that is easy to follow. Fillet gently, because the flesh is 
very tender and flakes apart easily when raw. There will be substantial 
centerline pin bones for the first 1/4 of the fish. Use your long nose 
pliers to pull them out, straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks quite a bit when fried but this 
isn't the easiest fish to skin. The flesh is tender and the skin is also 
thin and tender. Use care, and expect a few fragments of skin remaining 
on the fillets - they do no harm. See our standard long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1-1/2 pound fish yielded 12 ounces of skinless 
fillet (50%).</p> 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a medium flavored 
stock quite usable for soup. For details 
see our recipe <a href="../recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
Stock</b></a>.</p>
