[Picoroco (Spanish):  <i>Austromegabalanus psittacus</i> of family 
<i>Balanidae</i>]
<p>
This Barnacle can have an outer shell as much as 12 inches long (30 cm). They 
attach to rocks in the intertidal and littoral zones, mostly between 7 and 
66 feet depth (2 to 20 meters). They catch food with what were their legs, 
now feathery and called "cirri". They are found off the coasts of Peru, Chile, 
and the southern 2/3 of the Argentine coast, including around offshore 
islands.</p>
<p>
These barnacles are smallest along the northern coast of Peru, and get larger 
going south. They are most harvested along the south central coast of 
Chile. They have been overharvested, so are now being studied for aquaculture, 
and for export to Japan, where they will certainly fetch an astronomical 
price.

<p>After cooking, generally by steaming, the hard outer shell is broken apart 
and the lump of flesh is removed, with the beak (Operculum) still attached. 
The flesh is considered to taste much like crab, and the critter is filled 
with a salty brine that flavors the dish it is cooked in. </p>
<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, these Barnacles are an essential 
ingredient in Curanto, a mix of seafoods and potatoes cooked over red hot 
rocks in a pit oven dug into the ground. once the food is layered in, the 
pit is covered with leaves and soil. The food is ready to be dug out and 
eaten in about an hour. This is thought to be possibly the oldest recipe 
still used in the world today, dating from deep in prehistoric times. 
Today it is also made in cauldrons, and even in pressure cookers.
