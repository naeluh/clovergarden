[<i>Lepas anatifera</i> and similar species]
<p>
These Goose Barnacles attach to floating stuff on the high seas and depend 
on wave action to bring food to them. They're seen only when something 
they're attached to washes up on the shore. In an environment much less 
harsh than for intertidal species their stems are thinner. For these 
reasons they aren't much eaten. &nbsp;
