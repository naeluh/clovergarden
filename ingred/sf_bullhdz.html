  [<i>Ameiurus melas</i> (Black Bullhead) | <i>Ameiurus nebulosus</i> 
  (Brown Bullhead) | <i>Ameiurus natalis</i> (Yellow Bullhead); all of 
  family <i>Ictaluridae</i>]
</p><p>Bullheads are a variety of American freshwater catfish that 
inhabits slow moving backwaters with soft bottoms. They differ from most 
catfish in having squared off tails and being relatively small in size. 
<i>A. melas'</i> natural range is from the borders of Canada to Mexico 
and from the Rockies to the Appalachians. <i>A natalis</i> and 
<i>A. nebulosus</i> range from the Mississippi to the Atlantic but 
<i>nebulosus</i> extends north into Canada.</p>
<p>These fish can grow to over 24 inches and nearly 8 pounds, but are 
commonly about 10 inches and 1 pound (<i>A. natalis</i> a little smaller). 
<i>A. melas</i> has been introduced to Europe where it forms dense stunted 
populations, making it rather unpopular. These fish tolerate very adverse 
conditions, so it's unlikely they'll be able to get rid of them now. The 
photo specimen, probably <i>A. melas</i> or a hybrid, was 12-1/2 inches 
long and weighed 1 pound 4-1/2 ounces.</p>
<p>Both <i>A. nebulosus</i> and <i>A. melas</i> are currently farmed. 
None of these fish are considered threatened (they fall more into the 
nusience set), IUCN Red List "Not Evaluated".  Catfish have no scales, 
convenient for preparation, but it means they are not kosher or halal. 
Observant Jews and Muslims need to use Carp instead and deal with the 
spines.</p>

<p>Bullhead flesh is of a moderately dark color, but unlike darker ocean 
fish it does not have a strong oily flavor. If you go fishing in a region 
where bullheads abound, and you catch some, they are fine to cook and eat. 
On the other hand, I can't recommend buying them when Channel Cat is so 
available "on the hoof", and the more delicate Vietnamese catfish fillets 
are very economical.</p> 

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Bullheads may be more commonly found east of the 
Rockies, but here in Southern California they sometimes appear in the 
larger Asian markets.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Bullheads, like other Catfish, have no scales, 
but they are covered with a protective mucous making them exceedingly 
slippery. Particularly if you intend to use the fish skin-on you can 
start by sliding it into the sink and scrubbing it with dish washing 
detergent or a household cleanser, then rinse thoroughly.</p>

<p>The innards are stuck in well and will need a bit of pulling and 
scraping to get them all out. The esophagus is strong and will need to 
be cut with kitchen shears or a knife. The gills are also stuck in pretty 
hard, so you'll probably have to cut them loose under the chin with 
kitchen shears to pull them out. On the other hand, since you probably 
won't be using the head, why pull them out at all?</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is quite limp, which makes filleting 
a bit more difficult than with many fish. It's best to remove the head 
first to make handling easier. The bone structure is fairly orderly, but 
it doesn't go all the way to the top so you have to feel your way down to 
it. When I get to the rib cage I just cut it from the backbone with 
kitchen shears and pull the ribs from the fillet with long nose pliers. 
Like everything else on this fish they pull fairly hard, but they come out 
fairly clean without much flesh lost. There are no centerline spines to 
pull.</p>

<p>Instead of filleting, you could simply cut the fish into segments about 
1 to 1-1/2 inches long for use in soups and stews with skin and bones 
intact, as is done for many ethnic recipes. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver 
knife driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect for this.</p>

<p>The skirt (nape) on a Bullhead fillet is large and quite meaty but you 
will want to use it separately from the main fillet. The inside membrane 
is too thin to remove but shrinks and will curl the skirt badly. You 
should cook these skin-on so skin shrink will balance the membrane. If 
pan frying, fry skin side first.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Bullhead has a very large, heavy head, so yield 
of edible flesh isn't as good as with Channel Cat. A 1 pound 4-1/4 ounce 
fish yielded 9-1/2 ounces with skin and skirt on (47%), 7-3/4 ounces 
without the skirt (38%). Skin and skirt both removed the fillets weighed 
6-3/4 ounces (33%).</p> 

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Bullhead skin is quite tough but thin and does not 
have a strong or "off" flavor. It shrinks moderately when cooked, but 
enough that fillets for frying should probably be skinned. Skinning is 
easy with the standard long knife and cutting board method, but the knife 
should be tilted a little more steeply towards the skin than with most 
fish to avoid taking any flesh.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp;  Bullhead flesh holds its shape well when 
cooked so almost any cooking method can be used. It can be used for soups 
and stews as other catfish are. Many ethnic recipes use small catfish and 
simply cut them into 1 to 1-1/2 inch segments.</p> 

<p>When using bullhead in a soup or stew, it should go in for only the last 
15 minutes. Stir it in well when adding it and avoid stirring after that 
so it doesn't get broken up.</p>

<p>Bullhead fillets can be pan fried "skin-on" but the skin shrinks enough 
to curl the fillet fairly badly, so it's best to skin the fillets.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a fish stock that's 
a little strongly flavored for my taste.</p>
