<h1>Butterfish</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_butterst02g.jpg" alt="Whole Butterfish" class=mrg>
[family <i>Stromateidae</i>]
<p>
This is a family of very deep bodied fish, many of which are called 
something else, and other fish which are not butterfish are called 
butterfish. see 
<a href="sf_pompanz.html">Pompano</a>, 
<a href="sf_sablez.html">Sablefish</a>, 
<a href="sf_pomfrz.html">Pomfret</a> and others. One I have seen 
called "Butterfish" was actualy a <a href="sf_pacuz.html">Piranha</a>. 
The ones listed here are real butterfish, even though they may be called 
something else.</p>

[Pacific Harvestfish, <i>Peprilus medius</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
American Harvistfish <i>Peprilus paru</i>]
<p>
These are tropical / subtropical fish. <i>P. medius</i> ranges from the 
tip of Baja California to northern Chili. <i>P. paru</i> ranges from 
New York to the northern tip of Argentina. Unlike many small fish with 
full length fins, they are not difficult to eat and are quite good. 
<i>P. paru</i> can grow to a little over 11-1/2 inches,<i> P. medius</i> 
to a little over 9-1/2 inches, but the photo specimen was 8-1/4 inches 
and weighed 4-1/8 ounces, wild caught in Ecuador.

<h2>White Pomfret</h2>

<img src="img/sf_pomfw04e.jpg" alt="Whole White Pomfret 04e" class=mrg></a>
[Silver Pomfret; Pompano (Philippine); Butterfish; <i>Pampus argenteus</i> 
| similar: Chinese Silver Pomfret <i>Pampus chinensis</i>]
<p>
This tropical Indo-West Pacific fish is found near coasts from the 
Persian Gulf to Borneo, and as far north as mid Japan, but not as far south 
as Australia. It is not actually a pomfret but a butterfish. It can grow 
to 23 inches but the photo specimen, wild caught in India, was 10 inches 
and weighed 9-1/2 ounces, a typical market size here in Los Angeles. This 
is a major commercial catch within its range. IUCN rated "Not Evaluated", 
White Pomfret is not considered threatened. It is, in fact, expected to 
have extended its range by 2050.
