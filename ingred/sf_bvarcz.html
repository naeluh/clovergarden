<h1>Ark Clams - Blood Clams</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvarcfsl01e.jpg" alt="Fossil Ark Clam" class=mrg>
[Ark Shell; family <i>Arcidae</i>]
<p>
Found worldwide, Ark Clams are generally small, mostly 1 to 2 inches, 
but a few get tp 5 inches. Among the Ark Clams are the only shellfish 
that have red blood pigments (hemoglobin and myoglobin). This gives 
them better oxygen transfer allowing them to live in murky low oxygen 
environments in which most predators cannot thrive. These clams first 
appeared in the early Cretaceous, about 140 milion years ago. The fossil 
in the photo is of <i>Anadara diluvii</i>, which appeared about 23 
milion years ago and went extinct only about 12,000 years ago, at 
the end of the last ice age.

   <h2>Blood Cockle</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_bvbldcoc02d.jpg" alt="Blood Cockles, open and closed" class=mrg>
   [S&ograve; Huyet (Viet); Kkomak (Korea); <i>Anadara granosa</i> alt 
   <i>Tegillarca granosa</i>]
   <p>
   These clams are native to intertidal zones of the Indo-Pacific region, 
   from South Africa east to Australia and Polynesia, and as far north as 
   northern Japan. they are of great economic value and farmed in mud 
   flats in much of their range. They are sold frozen in Asian markets 
   whole, half shell, or as cooked frozen meat. The photo specimens were 
   purchased frozen from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San 
   Gabriel) for 2017 US $5.61 / pound - product of Vietnam. They can 
   get as large as 2.4 inches, but the largest in this batch was 1.4 
   inches long and 1.1 inches thick. They weighed about 44 to the pound 
   on average.</p>
   <p>As packaged, they were minimally cooked, thus the open one has 
   the appearance of being raw, and will look much less unappetizing 
   when cooked a bit more. Edible yield, as removed from the shells was 
   3.9 ounces / pound (24%), but after a brief boil they dropped to 2.7 
   ounces / pound (17%) due to loss of liquid. Flavor (after the short 
   boil) was quite good and clamy, but meatier than most clams of this 
   size. The red clam juice is not very useful as it turns gray with 
   cooking.</p>
   <h3>Safety:</h3> &nbsp; Although traditionally eaten raw, or with 
   a very short boil (Shanghai), this is risky. Due to their environment 
   and the amount of water they must filter, they contain more bacteria 
   and Viri than most clams, and should be coooked reasonably well.

   <h2>Mexican Blood Clam</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_bvbldmex02d.jpg" alt="Mexican Blood Clams, open and closed" class=mrg>
   [Concha Negra (Mexico, Peru, Nicaragua, El Salvador); Chucheca 
   (Panama, Costa Rica); Patas de Mula (Mexico); Concha Prieta 
   (Panama); Pianga (Colombia, Costa Rica; <i>Anadara tuberculosa</i>]
   <p>
   These clams are native to intertidal zones of the Eastern Pacific 
   from Baja Mexico to Peru. They can grow to 3 inches long, but the 
   photo specimens were up to 2.6 inches long and 1.7 inches thick. 
   Average weight of the batch was 1.2 ounces each. The open clam in 
   the photo is raw, and will look much less unappetizing when cooked. 
   Yield raw was about 18%, and 14% cooked.</p> 
   <p>The photo specimens were purchased from a live seafood tank at 
   a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US 
   $4.69 / pound. They tend to not open when steamed, even for more 
   than 10 minutes, but pried open, if they smell OK, they are edible.
   </p>
   <h3>Safety:</h3> &nbsp; These were illegal to import into the 
   United States until 2014, when the U.S. and Mexico came to an 
   agreement on assuring safety of these clams. Blood clams are more 
   a bacteria and virus risk than most clams because of their environment 
   and the amount of water they must filter. Personally, I eat them well 
   steamed rather than raw, though they are often served raw in Mexico 
   and in some Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles.

   <h2>Akagai</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_bvbldj01d.jpg" alt="Akagai Clam, live and partially open" class=mrg>
   [Inflated Ark; <i>Anadara broughtonii</i>]
   <p>
   These clams are native to intertidal zones of the Western Pacific, 
   south of the northern island of Japan (Hokkaido) down the East 
   Asian coasts to the Philippines and the Pacific side of Indonesia. 
   The population is extensive along north central Australia, and some 
   are found in southern New Zealand. They are similar to the Mexican 
   Blood Clam, but rounder and even thicker. They are usually prepared 
   as Sushi or Sashimi. These clams are both fished wild and farmed. 
   They can grow to nearly 5 inches long, but in aquaculture are usually 
   harvested at 2 inches and above.

   To the left is a typical serving of Akagai over Sushi Rice. The slices 
   may have been pounded flat to make them large enough to cover the 
   rice. For sushi, 3 inch long clams are needed.

   <h2>Noah's Ark Shell</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_bvarcn01d.jpg" alt="Arca noae Clam shell (1 half)" class=mrg>
   [<i>Arca noae</i>]<p>
   This Ark Clam is native mostly to the Mediterranean and the coast 
   of Morocco, but to a lesser extent down the west coast of Africa 
   with a significant population off the tip of South Africa. I do not 
   think this Ark Clam is a "blood clam", but, even though it's fished 
   commercially in the Adriatic Sea (between Italy and the Balkans) and 
   elsewhere, I can find almost no information about it. These clams 
   are usually around 4 inches long when mature.
