<h1>Geoduck Clam</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvgeo26g.jpg" alt="Live Geoduck Clam" class=mrg>
[Mirugai (Japan), Giant Clam (U.S. sushi bars), Elephant Trunk Clam 
(China), King Clam (U.S. marketing), Goiduck, Gweduck, 
<i>Panopea generosa</i> of family <i>Hiatellidae</i> (formerly 
confused with <i>Panopea abrupta</i>, an extinct species)]
<p>
The Geoduck (pronounce "gooy-duk") is the largest burrowing clam in 
the world. Individuals weighing 15 pounds are recorded and bigger ones 
rumored, but the photo specimen is a normal market size of 2.2 pounds. 
The shell was 6 inches long and 3-1/2 inches wide. Total length was 11 
inches, but that's meaningless since it could stretch out much longer. 
They are long lived with a record age of 168 years.</p>
<p>This clam is found only on the West Coast of North America from 
Washington State north through southern Alaska, and from the tidal zone 
to 350 feet deep. The name comes from the Nisqually Indian "gwe-duk" 
("dig-deep") and the strange spelling is thought to have been a 
transcription error.</p>
<p>Geoduck harvesting is tightly controlled both in the U.S. and Canada 
to assure sustainability. Most of the commercial harvest is sent to Japan 
and China where it fetches a fine price, and that market keeps it 
expensive here. Some much smaller <i>Panopea</i> species are found off 
Japan, China and New Zealand. New Zealand has apparently adopted the 
geoduck name for theirs.</p>

<p>In sushi bars, the siphons are sliced and served raw as "Mirugai" (or 
"Giant Clam" in North America). The texture is mildly crunchy and the 
flavor is pleasing and "oceany". The siphons are sliced and cooked in 
stir fries and in hot pots in China.</p>

<p>In Asia the body section is usually discarded. This makes the price 
much higher - but in Asia, a very high price is often the most important 
feature for "100 times enjoyment". </p>

<p> In North America, the body is also used, particularly for chowders. 
The body flesh is more tender and has a somewhat different flavor but 
it's certainly not something you want to throw out. On the other hand, 
some guys in North America have such fragile sexual identity they won't 
eat Geoduck at all.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California these are found 
mainly in larger Asian markets. Buy your duck out of a tank of water 
where you can poke it on the siphon and see if it pulls back a little 
- it will do so slowly if the duck is alive. The fish man should wring 
out as much water as he can before weighing it.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; As with other mollusks, geoduck toughens 
quickly with overcooking. If you've sliced it thin, just a few seconds 
in boiling water will be sufficient, a little longer if it is sliced 
thicker. If you cook it much beyond that, it needs to be cooked a long 
time to make it tender again, and the flavor and texture will be 
somewhat different.<p></p>

<h2 class=lrg>Preparing Geoduck</h2>

<p>Presumably, when you are ready to start preparing it, your duck has 
been in the fridge for some hours and will be even more sluggish than 
its usual sluggishness.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo30f.jpg" alt="Geoduck ready for preparation" class=mrg>
This 2.2 pound photo specimen clam was purchased live from an Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), California for 2017 US $8.99 per 
pound. The fish man wrung out as much water as he could before weighing 
it. Edible yield was 5-1/4 ounces (16%) for a cost of $55 per edible 
pound - however, I have had Geoducks with a much higher yield, up to 
around 40%. This one had a very large amount of visceral material, a 
slender siphon, a large shell for its weight, and retained a lot of 
water. In general, I expect this specimen represents the minimum yield 
you should expect.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo32f.jpg" alt="Removing Geoduck Shell" class=mrg>
Use a small knife and scrape it along the inside of the shell at both 
ends to free the duck. There won't be much resistance and the shell 
should peel away easily. Actually, you could scrape it off the shell 
with your fingers, but at this point the duck will pull its shell as 
far closed as it can, so you may not be able to get fingers in there. 
The adductor muscles are at the ends of the shell, and they aren't large 
or tough, as befits a clam that can't actually close its shell. 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo34d.jpg" alt="Geoduck with Shell Removed" class=mrg>
You should now have a shell with almost no flesh on it and a clam with 
no shell. 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo36f.jpg" alt="Geoduck with Visceral Mass Removed" class=mrg>
Next pull off and discard the "visceral mass", consisting of gills, an 
egg shaped stomach and what little awareness a geoduck has. This all 
pulls off fairly easily by hand, easiest starting it the end opposite 
the siphon. Pull off any loose materials around the body and you're 
ready to skin your duck.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo37d.jpg" alt="Losening the Geoduck's Skin" class=mrg>
In a wide pan, heat sufficient water to completely cover the duck, just 
hot enough so you can keep your fingers in it for only a second or two 
(150&deg;F/66&deg;C). Dump in the duck and let it sit for 30 to 45 
seconds. Pull it out and let it drain.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_bvgeo40f.jpg" alt="Peeling off Geoduck's Skin" class=mrg>
You should now be able to easily peel the skin off starting 
from the part of the body where the open side of the shell was and 
and continuing right off the end of the siphon.

<img src="img/sf_bvgeo44c.jpg" alt="Geoduck Cross Sections" class=mrg>
You now have a "recipe ready" Geoduck. The right photo shows cross 
sections of the siphon and body, both taken from about 1 inch away from 
where the siphon and body meet.
