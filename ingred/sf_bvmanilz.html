[Japanese Littleneck; <i>Venerupis philippinarum</i>]
<p>
These clams were accidentally introduced in the Pacific Northwest of 
the U.S. and Canada when Pacific Oysters were brought from Japan. They 
quickly became an invasive species but are now so popular a harvest both 
commercially and recreationally that the fishery is highly regulated.</p>
<p>These clams are also an aquaculture crop and are harvested at various 
sizes from 1-1/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches. The main problem with this crop is 
slow growth, taking over 3 years to reach harvest size. The photo 
specimens were typically 1.9 inches the long way by 1.4 inches and 0.8 
inch thick - 28 clams to the pound.</p>

<p>Given the difference in cost per ounce (see Yield below), why would 
anyone buy Manilla Clams in the shell? Well, a couple of reasons. First 
because they are so tender and delicious freshly steamed, and, if you're 
clever you can capture the equally delicious fresh clam juice. The second 
reason is fancy presentation. Many seafood soups and stews expect tiny 
clams in the shell as one of the ingredients.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Los Angeles, all the Asian markets 
have these. The Chnese / Vietnamese markets usually have them in 
live tanks. The Philippine markets usually have them on ice. They 
are relatively expensive (see "Yield" below).<p></p>

<h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; These clams can be kept in the refrigerator 
a week or so. They should be in an open container so they can breath, 
and covered with a damp cloth to keep humidity high.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A pound of clams will yield about 3 ounces of 
meat (19%). At the current price (2013) of $3.99 / pound that comes to 
just over US $21 per pound of meat. Frozen "Manilla Clam Meat" or 
"Short Neck Clam Meat" (whole shucked clams) runs between $2.99 and $3.99 
in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles. I have also bought them (as 
"Short Neck Clams") cooked in the shell and frozen in the cooking juice 
at $3.99 for 2 pounds, yielding $9.12 per edible pound.<p></p>
