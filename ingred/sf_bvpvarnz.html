Native to estuaries of Japan and Korea, These clams were brought 
to Victoria Island, Canada around 1988, probably in ship's ballast 
water. They have spread north from there, and south along the northern 
coast of Washington State. A similar introduction now infests most of 
the coastal estuaries of the state of Oregon. They grow to about 2.75 
inches measured the long way, but the largest of the photo specimens was 
2.0 inches, weighing 0.88 ounce (25 gm). They are not currently farmed, 
but are harvested from high in the intertidal zone (above the Manilla 
Clam zone), where there can be more than 1400 clams per square yard.</p>

<p>Purple Varnish Clams have a good strong clam flavor and tender 
flesh, if not overcooked. Because they are smaller and lighter than 
Manilla clams, I consider them good for fancy seafood soups where whole 
live clams are included. <b><u>Note:</u></b> depending on harvest 
location, many of these clams can contain a parasitic 
<a href="sf_cbpeaz.html"><b>Pea Crab</b></a>. Do not be frightened, 
these don't harm the edibility of the clam, and many consider them a 
gourmet treat, raw or cooked. It is reported that George Washington 
liked them scattered over his oyster soup as a garnish.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Labeled "Savory Clams" (a name made up by the 
Canadians), these clams can now sometimes be found in the live tanks of 
big Asian markets. They come from Canada, where a commercial fishery has 
been established. The photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 U.S. $3.99 / pound.  Since 
they are harvested wild, a batch will vary quite widely in size. The 
specimen batch included clams from 2 inches and 0.88 ounce (25 gm) to 
1.3 inches and 0.25 ounce (7 gm). They averaged 34 clams per pound.
<p></p>

<p>These clams can be harvested recreationally in Washington and 
Oregon states, but check with the local fishery authorities about 
safety (they can retain shellfish toxins under some conditions), and 
mind the quotas.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These clams are better than Manilla Clams 
for dry storage. They are able to survive even 30 days in the 
refrigerator. They should be in an open container so they can 
breath, and covered with a damp cloth to keep humidity high.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A pound of clams will yield about 4.2 ounces of 
meat (26%). At the current price (2016) of $3.99 / pound that comes to 
just over US $15 per pound of meat, significantly better than Manilla 
Clams due to their lighter shells.<p></p>
