<h1>Razor Clams</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvraz11g.jpg" alt="Razor Clams, closed and open" class=mrg>
[Typical culinary species of the four most important genera:
  <br><b>Atlantic Jackknife Clam;</b> <i>Ensis directus</i>	(North 
    America, now invading Europe)
  <br><b>Pacific Razor Clam;</b> <i>Siliqua patula</i> (Alaska to Pismo 
    Beach, California)
  <br><b>Razon Shell;</b> <i>Ensis arcuatus</i> (Eastern Canada, 
    Northern Europe)
  <br><b>Gould's Razor Clam;</b> <i>Solon strictus</i> (East Asia)]
<p>
All the genera listed above look much like the photo specimens, except 
the Pacific (<i>Siliqua patula</i>) which is much shorter. Most are 
Northern Hemisphere clams, but one species, Navaja (<i>Ensis macha</i>), 
inhabits both coasts of South America and is a significant commercial 
catch in Chile. Razor Clams feature a digging foot at one end and a 
double siphon at the other, Razor clams are very highly regarded as 
food but are difficult to catch because they can dig down faster than 
a person can dig them up, and some can dig down more than 40 feet.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were purchased live at a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles at 2013 US $5.49/pound. They may be <i>Ensis directus</i> 
or an almost identical species. The longest was 5.88 inches long 
and 7/8 inch wide. They typically weighed 1.63 ounces and yielded 0.63 
ounce steamed edible (39%), or $14.08 per edible pound. That's not at 
all bad for shellfish around here. The open photo specimen at right in 
the photo has been steamed.</p>

The specimens in the photo to the left are of typical shape for the 
Pacific razor clam, but the one on our West Coast (<i>Siliqua patula</i>) 
has a sorter double siphon rather than two elongated siphons. These 
specimens were purchased from the frozen food cases at a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles at 2009 US $6.29/pound (thawed weight). They 
were typically 2.45 inches long and 0.8 inches wide. 8.88 ounces 
yielded 2.13 ounces steamed edible (24%) or $26.14 per edible pound.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are not easy to find here in Southern 
California, but as noted above, Asian fish markets may have some now 
and then. I've seen the live ones for the first time in September 
2013, but certainly hope they become a regular item. They are a much 
better value than the frozen ones, both for cost per pound and flavor.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Steam them lightly and eat them plain or with 
a very light dip. You don't want to screw around with something so 
simple and so delicious. Of course you can also use them in seafood 
soups. Steam lightly first (to make them easy to shell), shell and cut. 
Add to the soup in the last minute to avoid overcooking.<p></p>

<p>The live specimens (photo at top) were tender and delicious with a 
distinctly briny flavor. They are very meaty due to the powerful digging 
foot which occupies most of the shell. Note the one at the right that has 
been steamed. The dark splotch at left center is the stomach, which is 
easy to clean out if you want to bother. Clams are usually eaten stomach 
contents and all.</p>
