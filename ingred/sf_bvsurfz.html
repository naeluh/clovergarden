<h1>Atlantic Surf Clam</h1>

[Hokkigai (Japan); Skimmer, Hen Clam (Maine); Sea Clam, Giant Clam, 
  Bar Clam (Canada); <i>Spisula solidissima</i> & subspecies]
<p>
This very large clam (often over 6.5 inches) is found in the northwest 
Atlantic from the southern Gulf of St. Laurence, Canada, to the Gulf of 
Mexico. It is triangular in shape and lives in sand just to the sea side 
of the surf zone. In the U.S. the foot (called "tongue") is used 
to make clam strips and the strap meat around the edge of the shell and 
the adductor muscles that closes the shell are chopped and used for clam 
chowder and similar recipes. The foot is also exported to Japan for use 
as sushi. It is larger than the foot of their local surf clams.</p>

The edible parts of this clam are the strap meat, top and bottom at 
the edge of the shell, including the siphon (at the bottom tip), the 
two adductor muscles (opposite the muscle scars on the top shell at the 
right), and the foot (center left). The rest is the gill (center right) 
under which is a big bag of whatever the clam has sucked in recently, 
sort of like a full vacuum cleaner bag.</p>


<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; You don't want to buy them in the shell, as 
pictured at the top of the page, and I'll tell you why. These were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2017 US $3.99 / pound. The two of them cost me $11 for 2.76 pounds. 
This yielded 6.5 ounces of edible clam. That equals $27 / pound edible 
- and half of that is just chowder grade.

This is how the feet are sold, boxed in the frozen food cases of 
Asian markets here in Los Angeles. How they get that pretty red 
and white color scheme, I don't know. The live ones were beige and 
barely reddish towards the tip.
