[Shishamo (Japan (with roe)); <i>Mallotus villosus</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the Arctic region in both Atlantic and Pacific, 
venturing well above the Arctic Circle (in summer). They are found as 
far south as the northern tip of Japan and the US-Canada border in the 
Pacific. In the Atlantic they range as far south as the Gulf of Maine, 
USA and the British Isles. The largest concentrations are across the 
North Pacific and around the island of Newfoundland, Canada.</p>

<p>Capelin are harvested for fish meal and fish oil as well 
as for human consumption. Capelin roe (bottom in photo to the left) is a 
high value item and is served as <i>masago</i> in sushi bars in Japan 
and California. Asian markets here in Los Angeles sell capelin with 
roe when in season.  Males grow to a bit over 7-3/4 inches, females to 
a little over 9-3/4 inches, but the photo specimen was 6 inches and 
weighed 7-1/2 ounces including 2-1/8 ounces of roe. IUCN Red Listed 
NE (Not Evaluated), but probably not threatened at this time.</p>

Shishamo (capelin with roe) is lightly battered and fried whole in 
Japan.
<p>In sushi bars, the capelin eggs (masago) are usually dyed bright 
red-orange.They are served on a dollop of sushi rice with a wrap of nori 
seaweed around it to hold the eggs in place. For other markets they are 
dyed black to resemble sturgeon caviar, or bright red. The individual 
eggs are about 0.050 inch diameter (1.3 mm) The specimens (pasteurized) 
were purchased on-line at 2016 US $4.40 per ounce.
