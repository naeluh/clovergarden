<p>
This Asian (probably Chinese) carp has been introduced worldwide and 
escapees from pond clearing duty now populate waters in 23 U.S. states 
where they, and their near relative the Silver Carp, are considered 
troublesome invasive species. Bighead is a filter feeding fish that lives 
on plankton near the surface of the water and is used to clear algae from 
ponds.</p>
<p>This fish is common in Asian markets in Los Angeles, where it is 
generally sold in sections due to its large size.  Split heads are sold 
for making soup. This fish can grow to over 5 feet and 100 pounds, but 
the photo specimen was 3 feet 6 inches and weighed 19.2 pounds, factory 
cleaned. That's a full size dinner fork in the picture for scale.</p>

<p>This fish is considered very desirable through most of the world and 
is one of the most eaten fish worldwide, but in North America it is cooked 
and eaten mainly by Asians.  The flesh of Bighead Carp is near white and 
has practically no "fishy" taste.  There's a dark streak down the side 
just under the skin but that streak does not have a strong flavor. The 
flesh, which breaks into large flakes when cooked, is tender but durable 
enough for steaming, poaching and using in soup, but I don't consider 
it a particularly good frying fish.</p>

<p>Bighead Carp does have a "spine problem" similar to that of other carp 
and to <a href="sf_milkz.html">Milkfish</a> (Bangus), a fish in a 
related order. Some find the spines annoying, but unlike those of the 
milkfish they are impossible to remove before cooking. To enjoy 
delicious carp Americans just have to learn to deal with the spines at 
the table like the rest of the world does.</p>

<p>Personally I don't have a problem with the spines. As with most fish, 
I eat carp with chopsticks, breaking it up as I go along. The spines are 
large and easy to find that way. You can remove the spines after cooking 
(see below), but if you don't, provide a small bowl or some other way for 
your guests to dispose of the spines. Even in formal Victorian society it 
was permissible to remove fish bones from the mouth (but nothing else).
</p>

<p>I recommend cutting Bighead Carp into lengths of 2-1/2 to 3 inches as 
shorter pieces make it more difficult to deal with the spines. Poaching or 
steaming are excellent methods for cooking. After pieces are cooked you 
will find the spines projecting beyond the flesh where, if you don't want 
to deal with them at the table, they can easily be pulled with your long 
nose pliers.</p>

<p>Bighead carp skin is quite thick and gelatinous, and a  little chewy, 
but does not have a strong or off flavor. It shrinks moderately when 
cooked but not enough to be troublesome, but is a little difficult to 
deal with on the plate. I strip it off the fillet, cut it into short 
strips and add them to fish soup because I like gelatinous things.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish can be found sold in chunks in many 
East and Southeast Asian markets but I've never seen it in the Philippine 
fish markets. Occasionally it is sold whole - or if you want a whole one 
you can ask at the fish counter (if anyone there speaks English).<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most cooking methods suitable for a large fish 
can be used for Bighead Carp. It remains firm enough to steam or poach 
but I don't consider it a good frying fish - too fragile and not 
enough oil in the flesh. It is tender, so while simmering for 10 to 15 
minutes is fine, a rapid boil or much longer cooking is likely to break 
it up.<p></p>

<h3>Do Not</h3> cut carp into pieces smaller than 2 inches long. Doing 
so makes the spines nearly impossible to deal with. For small fish, 
(fillets or whole) it is best to not cut at all if possible.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Most carp have huge hard scales, 
but Bighead has small flexible scales. Unfortunately this is not good 
news because there's a zillion of them and they adhere strongly to the 
skin. I find shaving them off with the sharp edge of the knife works 
better than regular scraping with the back of the knife, but some have 
to be pulled using long nose pliers. This is a difficult to scale fish, 
but not as bad as piranha.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to clean, just cut 
from the vent right up to the underside of the jaw (you'll need kitchen 
shears from the pelvic fins forward) and pull stuff out. The gills are 
fairly soft and pull out relatively easily, but you may want to cut them 
loose at the ends with your kitchen shears. Of course, if you don't 
intend to use the head you needn't pull the gills.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is not difficult to fillet, though 
there are areas where there are no bones to follow. I fillet the flesh 
off the ribs rather than cut them loose and deal with them on the fillet. 
The ribs are easy to follow and carp bones are stuck in hard and 
difficult to pull. The region at the ends of the ribs is very thin and 
will separate, so nothing below the ribs is included in my weight for 
fillets. In any case the belly contains some fat which may be bitter, so 
is best discarded.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen weighed 19.2 pounds 
and yielded 7 pounds of skin-on fillets  (36%) and 6 pounds 2 ounces of 
skin-off filets (32%). The skin-off fillets were 1-1/4 inches thick at 
the thickest point. This yield is low because of the weight of the 
massive head, but at the right price (I paid 2009 US $0.99 per pound 
for the photo specimen), it can still be quite economical.

<p>Bighead Carp heads are commonly sold in Asian markets for making soup, 
but I personally am not real fond of carp stock so I would use it only for 
a recipe that called for it specifically. Unlike Grass Carp stock I didn't 
notice any bitterness with Bighead.</p>
