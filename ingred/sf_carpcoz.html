<h1>Common Carp</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_carpy10g.jpg" alt="Whole Common Carp" class=mrg>
[<i>Cyprinus carpio carpio</i>]
<p>
Possibly originating in the Danube river, these fish have been 
transplanted all around the world and have become pests in some areas. 
They can grow to 80 pounds and 47 inches long but the photo specimen was 
25-3/4 inches and weighed 7 pounds.</p>
<p>This is a highly commercial fish just about everywhere except North 
America, where fancy varieties are used mainly as a landscaping accent. 
Common Carp prefer larger lakes and slow moving streams with muddy 
bottoms    and eat just about anything. Wild carp and decorative koi 
tend to be less deep of body and without the distinct hump typical of 
farmed carp.This fish has been farmed since at least the time of the 
Roman Empire. About 3,300,000 <u>tons</u> per year of this carp are 
farmend, 70% farmed in China.</p>

<p>In England (also France) there are recreational "Catch and Release" 
carp ponds for fishing enthusiasts (carp are not easy to catch). If the 
mangement suspects you are an Eastern European they will not let you 
in. Eastern Europeans don't understand the "release" part, and try to 
take the carp home for dinner.</p>
<p>Two genetic variations of this carp popular in the fishing ponds are 
the Mirror Carp, with an incomplete coverage of very large mirror-like 
scales, and the Leather Carp, with just a few scales along the back 
and/or near the tail. Individuals are easily identified by scale pattern, 
so most over 40 pounds have been given names. Heather the Leather was 
the most famous, at 50 years old and 52 pounds. Hundreds of people came 
from all over Europe to try to catch her, but she was a wary fish and 
was only caught about 3 times a year.</p>

<p>The flesh of Common Carp is white, tender, smooth in texture and mild 
with practically no "fishy" taste. Just about anyone should find it 
enjoyable - but, Common Carp does, like all carp, have a "spine problem". 
Some find these thread-like spines rather annoying, but unlike those of 
the milkfish they are impossible to remove before cooking. To enjoy 
delicious carp, Americans just have to learn to deal with the spines at 
the table like the rest of the world does. If you don't want to deal 
with them, use catfish instead (unless you're an observant Jew or Muslim 
- catfish isn't kosher or halal). Strangely, though I have read many 
carp recipes in cookbooks from many cuisines, not a single recipe has 
mentioned this spine problem.</p>

<p>Personally I don't have a problem with the spines. As with most fish 
I eat carp with chopsticks, breaking it up as I go along. The spines are 
large and are easy to find that way. In any case, do provide a small bowl 
or some other way for your guests to dispose of the spines. Even in formal 
Victorian society it was permissible to remove fish bones from the mouth 
(but nothing else).</p>

<p>There's no need to skin Common Carp, but some picky eaters just won't 
eat skin, so you may want to serve filets skin side down so such people 
can leave it on the plate easily, or you can easily peel it off after 
cooking.</p>

<p>The whole fish is often cut into segments and cooked skin-on as in 
the Polish recipe for "Carp Jewish Style". This calls for the carp to be 
cut into chunks and the head to be split in half. The halves are laid 
over the vegetables along with the chunks for cooking (head to be removed 
before serving).</p>

<p>Another way carp is prepared is to cut the flesh into segments but 
leave the backbone intact. After cooking the backbone will no longer hold 
the fish together and the segments can be distributed easily.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Most American fish markets don't carry carp, 
but it can usually be found in markets serving a Southeast Asian 
Chinese or Philippine community.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most cooking methods suitable for a 
large fish can be used for Common Carp. It remains firm enough to steam 
and pan fries just fine with a light dusting of rice flour. It is tender, 
so while simmering for 10 to 15 minutes is fine, a rapid boil or much 
longer cooking is likely to break it up.<p></p>

<h3>Do Not</h3> cut carp into pieces smaller than about 2 inches on a 
side. Doing so makes the spines nearly impossible to deal with.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Common Carp is completely covered with very 
large scales, nearly 1 inch square for that 7 pounder. Adhesion is 
fairly firm so they take some effort to scrape off and they'll fly 
around quite a bit. They curl as they dry so they're not difficult to 
clean up, but make sure they don't get into your drains, they could 
cause a clog.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp;  This fish is fairly easy to clean, just cut 
from the vent right up to the underside of the jaw (you'll need kitchen 
shears from the pelvic fins forward) and pull stuff out. There's a big 
two chamber swim bladder but it comes out easily and the gills are fairly 
easy to pull out. The one obstacle is the throat which contains a massive 
grinding mechanism that's not real easy to pull out.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Common Carp skin does not shrink badly when 
cooked, in fact you can take a hunk of skin and pan fry it and it'll stay 
pretty flat. It has no strong or objectional flavors, so it hardly seems 
worth the bother to remove it. If you insist, Carp fillets can be skinned 
fairly easily using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is easy to fillet with plenty of 
bones to follow. It is one fish where I fillet the flesh off the ribs 
rather than cut them loose and deal with them on the fillet. They're 
easy to follow and carp bones are stuck in hard and difficult to pull.
<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen, 25-3/4 inches long 
and 7 pounds, yielded 3 pounds 5 oz of skin-on fillet (47%) and 2 pounds 
14oz skinless fillet (41%). Not a super high yield but typical of fish 
with bony heads and lots of innards. At 2006 US $0.99/pound for that 7 
pounder (purchased in a Philippine market in Los Angeles) that's still 
pretty economical compared to most fish.<p></p>

<h3>Soup Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Carp heads, fins and bones make a 
serviceable medium flavored stock, and you could probably toss in 
skins as well. There is very little oil - but you should separate what 
there is and discard it (use your gravy separator).<p></p>

<p>Note: this 7 pound carp in the photo showed all signs of being a fresh 
fish (bright eyes, red gills, springy flesh, clean, firm innards) but did 
have a fairly strong musky odor with a hint of ammonia. After thoroughly 
scrubbing the outside of the fish the odor was completely gone.</p>
