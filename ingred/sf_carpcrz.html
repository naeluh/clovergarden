[<i>Carassius carassius</i>]
<p>
Native to Europe through Siberia and into China, this highly 
commercial carp is both farmed and caught wild, Crucians can grow to 
25 inches and 6.6 pounds but are more commonly between 1 and 3 pounds. 
hey are found throughout European lakes, streams and rivers, and as 
far north as Finland. It can be told from the very similar looking 
Prussian carp by it's more golden color, it's tail is not so deeply 
forked, and by the thin lining of the body cavity being white, whereas 
it is black for the Prussian. It also has a more rounded snout than 
other carp.</p>
<p>The Crucian Carp has an amazing ability to survive for months with 
almost no oxygen. This is an adaption to allow survival in ponds that 
are frozen over and covered with snow, ponds predators can't survive 
in. IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).
