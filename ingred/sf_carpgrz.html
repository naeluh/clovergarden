<h1>Grass Carp</h1>

[Rehu (India); <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>]
<p>
   A silver bodied fresh water fish imported from Asia, the grass carp 
   can grow to 59 inches and nearly 100 pounds, but the photo specimen was 
   27 inches and 8.4 pounds. Grass carp are voracious eaters of underwater 
   vegetation and are an important food fish in Asia, both farmed and 
   caught wild.</p>
   <p>Use of triploid (sterile) grass carp to control invasive aquatic 
   weeds was pioneered in the Imperial Valley of California. Triploids are 
   created by slightly damaging eggs immediately after fertilization. 
   They grow to only 40 pounds in the irrigation channels and live half 
   as long as diploid carp but they eat about 90% as much and won't establish 
   wild populations where they are not wanted. The California hatchery has 
   been studied by teams from many states and countries.</p>

<h3><u>Warning:</u></h3> &nbsp; In the state of California, 
transporting a live grass carp without valid permits, or failing to 
release one caught in the irrigation systems, carries a penalty of $5000 
and/or a year in jail. Many other states also have stringent regulations.

<p>The flesh of Grass Carp is white, tender, smooth in texture and mild 
with practically no "fishy" taste. Just about anyone should find it 
enjoyable - but, Grass Carp does, like all carp, have a "spine problem" 
similar to <a href="sf_milkz.html">Milkfish</a> (Bangus), a fish in a 
related order. Some find the spines rather annoying, but unlike those of 
the milkfish they are impossible to remove before cooking. To enjoy 
delicious carp Americans just have to learn to deal with the spines at 
the table like the rest of the world does. If you don't want to deal with 
them, use catfish instead (unless you're an observant Jew or Muslim - 
catfish isn't kosher or halal).</p>

<p>Personally I don't have a problem with the spines. As with most fish 
I eat carp with chopsticks, breaking it up as I go along. The spines are 
large and are easy to find that way. In any case, do provide a small bowl 
or some other way for your guests to dispose of the spines. Even in formal 
Victorian society it was permissible to remove fish bones from the mouth 
(but nothing else).</p>

<p>There's no need to skin grass carp, but some picky eaters just won't 
eat skin, so you may want to serve filets skin side down so such people can 
leave it on the plate easily, or you can easily peel it off after cooking.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Grass Carp can often be found in 
markets serving a Southeast Asian or Chinese community, at least here in 
California it can. I haven't seen it in the Philippine markets, though, 
which do stock <a href="sf_carpcoz.html">Common Carp</a>. As with 
Bighead Carp, Grass Carp is usually cut into cross sections because the 
fish is so large, but 8 to 10 pounders can sometimes be found whole.  If 
you see pieces and want a whole fish ask the fish guy (if he speaks any 
English) what he has in back.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most cooking methods suitable for a 
large fish can be used for Grass Carp. It remains firm enough to steam and 
pan fries just fine with a light dusting of rice flour. It is tender, so 
while simmering for 10 to 15 minutes is fine, a rapid boil or much longer 
cooking is likely to break it up.<p></p>

<h3>Do Not</h3> cut carp into pieces smaller than about 2 inches on a 
side. Doing so makes the spines nearly impossible to deal with.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Grass Carp is completely covered 
with very large scales, about 3/4 inch square for an 8 pounder. Adhesion 
is moderate so they're not hard to scrape off, but they are springy so 
they'll fly around a bit. They curl as they dry so they're not difficult 
to clean up, but make sure they don't get into your drains, they could 
cause a clog.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp;  This fish is fairly easy to clean, just cut 
from the vent right up to the underside of the jaw (you'll need kitchen 
shears from the pelvic fins forward) and pull stuff out. There's a big 
two chamber swim bladder but it comes out easily and the gills are fairly 
easy to pull out. The one obstacle is the throat which contains a massive 
grinding mechanism that's not real easy to pull out.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Grass Carp skin does not shrink badly when cooked, 
in fact you can take a hunk of skin and pan fry it and it'll stay pretty 
flat. It has no strong or objectional flavors, so it hardly seems worth 
the bother to remove it. If you insist, Grass Carp fillets can be skinned 
fairly easily using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is easy to fillet with plenty of bones 
to follow. It is one fish where I fillet the flesh off the ribs rather 
than cut them loose and deal with them on the fillet. They're easy to 
follow and carp bones are stuck in hard and difficult to pull.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen, 27 inches long and 
8.4 pounds, yielded 4.5 pounds of skin-on fillet (54%). I don't have an 
exact skinless weight because I never bother to skin it. The filets were 
1 inch thick at the thickest part. The specimen was sold at 2009 US 
$1.39 per pound in Alhambra, CA, so it's pretty economical compared to 
many fish.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I've found stock made from Grass Carp heads, 
fins and bones a bit too bitter and with a flavor not to my liking.
