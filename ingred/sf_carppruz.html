[<i>Carassius gibelio</i>]
<p>
This carp may have originated in eastern Asia or Siberia, but is 
now also found through most of Europe. It is a fast breeder and can 
becomes a pest where introduced. This fish is often confused with the 
<a href="sf_carpcrz.html">Crucian Carp</a>, which has caused it 
to be accidentally stocked where it was not wanted. The Crucian is 
considered more desirable commercially. They can be told apart by 
the more golden color of the Crucian, by the more deeply forked 
tail of the Prussian, and the thin lining of the body cavity is black, 
whereas it is white in the Crucian. This fish can grow to about 14 
inches (some sources say 17 inches), but the photo specimen was 11 
inches and weighed 1 pound 1-3/4 ounces.</p>

<p>Prussian Carp is a fish to eat in quiet contemplation, not boisterous 
conversation, and it should never be served to children. You must pay 
close attention to the fish, because its flesh has long, sharp, thread 
like, "Y" shaped spines embedded in it. They are very thin and not easy 
to see.</p>

<p>Personally I don't have a big problem with the spines. As with 
other fish, I eat carp with chopsticks, breaking it up into small pieces 
as I go along. The spines are fairly easy to find and pull out that way, 
but some do sneak by and have to be dealt with in the mouth. Even in 
formal Victorian society it was permissible to remove fish bones from 
the mouth (but nothing else) so they could enjoy delicious carp.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have recently found this fish in a large 
Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock, actually) for 2016 US 
$1.99 / pound. This market has almost always had the much larger 
Common Carp, but the Prussian Carp is new.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Most cooking methods can be used with 
Prussian Carp. Fillets can be pan fried with a light dusting of rice 
flour, but not heavy batter which would make the spines very difficult 
to find. For the same reason only light sauces should be used. I eat 
it with my favorite <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html">Lemon 
Wine Sauce for Fish</a>.The flesh remains firm enough to steam and 
poach, but is is quite tender, so a rapid boil or long cooking is 
likely to break it up. You can poach fillets skin-on. They will curl, 
but you can lay them out flat on the plate.<p></p>

<h3><u>Do Not</u></h3> cut any carp into pieces smaller than 2 inches long. 
Doing so makes the spines nearly impossible to deal with. For small fish, 
(fillets or whole) it is best to not cut them at all if possible. The 
larger the fish, the easier the spines are to deal with.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; The scales are large, and have good adhesion, 
so they take some energy to scrape off and fly about quite a bit. They 
curl as they dry so are easy to clean up - but don't let them get into 
your drains, they could clog.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to clean, just cut 
from the vent right up to the underside of the jaw (you'll need kitchen 
shears from the pelvic fins forward) and pull stuff out. While the 
innards pull out easily enough, there's quite a lot of them, and they 
are rather mushy. Rinse the cavity well, rubbing off any remaining 
mush. The gills are fairly easy to pull out, but break up a lot.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Prussian Carp skin shrinks only moderately when 
cooked. It has no strong or objectional flavors, so it hardly seems 
worth the bother to remove it. If you insist, Prussian Carp fillets can 
be skinned using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but be warned - the skin 
is thin, delicate and breaks up very easily - better to leave it.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet, with 
a coherent bone structure to follow. The flesh is, however, soft and 
tender, so handle with care. When you get to the rib cage, just use 
your kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone and pull them 
from the fillet with long nose pliers. There are no centerline pin 
bones to pull.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen, 11 inches long and 1 pound 
1-3/4 ounces yielded 8-3/8 ounces of skin-on fillet (47%). Some fish, 
with more stuff inside, have yielded 43% skin-on.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Prussian Carp heads, fins, bones and any removed 
skins make a rather strong stock with a flavor I do not particularly 
like.<p></p>
