<h1>Carp Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_carpco01h.jpg" alt="School of Koi" class=mrg>
[Koi (Japanese), family <i> Cyprinidae</i>]
<p>
The modern Carp family (<i>Cyprinidae</i>) has been around for about 
55 million years and the carp order (<i>Cypriniformes</i>) since the end 
of the Cretaceous 65 million years ago. They are not considered a prime 
eating fish in North America, but are very popular on the menu Europe, 
particularly Poland, and are the most important farmed fish in Asia.</p>
<p>Coming in many brilliant colors and patterns, and happy to live in 
small freshwater ponds, carp is the primary fish displayed in decorative 
gardens. Call a fancy carp "Koi" and it can sell for hundreds or even 
thousands of dollars. Unprotected ponds need big submerged pipes for 
them to sleep in because they are definitely on the menu for raccoons.

<br><img src="img/sf_asp01e.jpg" alt="Two Whole Asp" class=mrg>
[Aral Asp (Uzbek); Zherekh (Russia, etc.); <i>Leuciscus aspius</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to lakes and rivers of most of Europe, including 
European Russia, and rivers and lakes of Central Asia. They can grow 
to nearly 47 inches and 20 pounds, but are commonly about 21 inches 
long. IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern). This fish is both caught 
wild and farmed. Preparation and cooking 
is probably similar to

<h2>Barbel</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_barbel01e.jpg" alt="Live Barbel" class=mrg>
[<i>Barbus barbus</i> and other <i>Barbus</i> species]
<p>
This fish is native to lakes and rivers of most of Europe, including 
European Russia. They can grow to nearly 47 inches and 26 pounds, 
but are commonly about 12 inches long. Barbel are found in the rivers 
of Uzbekistan, and possible other Central Asian rivers. Barbel are 
pretty much all European, but these may have been introduced. 
IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern). This fish is both caught wild 
as a minor commercial catch, and farmed. &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: 
&nbsp; Barbel roe is highly toxic, and the female fish may have 
some toxicity during the spawning season. Preparation and cooking 
is probably similar to

[Speckled Amur, Tongsan, Noble Fish, <i>Hypothalmichthys nobilis</i> 
alt <i>Aristichthys nobilis</i>]
<p>
This Asian (probably Chinese) carp has been introduced worldwide and 
escapees from pond clearing duty now populate waters in 23 U.S. states 
where they, and their near relative the Silver Carp, are considered 
troublesome invasive species. Bighead is a filter feeding fish that 
lives on plankton near the surface of the water and is used to clear 
algae from ponds.</p>
<p>This fish is common in Asian markets in Los Angeles where it is 
generally sold in sections due to its large size.  Split heads are 
sold for making soup. This fish can grow to over 5 feet and 100 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 3 feet 6 inches and weighed 19.2 pounds, 
factory cleaned. That's a full size dinner fork in the picture for 
scale.

<h2>Black Carp</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_carpbk02e.jpg" alt="Live Black Carp 02e" class=mrg>
[<i>Mylopharyngodon piceus</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to larger lakes and rivers in East Asia, from 
the Amur River Basin south to Vietnam. Black carp are highly 
commercial in China and are the most prestigious (and expensive) of 
the native fish there, but have not become as widespread as other 
Asian carp worldwide. I have not seen them in the Asian fish markets 
here in Southern California. They can grow to nearly 6 feet and 77 
pounds, and can become pests if they escape. A few have been found 
loose in the Mississippi basin. They live on snails and mussels so 
some attempts have been made to use this fish to control mollusks. 
They are considered a threat to native mollusks, so sterile fish are 
generally used to prevent wild populations. It is illegal to carry a 
live black carp into the United States, across state borders, or to 
posses one in many states. IUCN Red Listed DD (Data Deficient). It 
is both caught wild and farmed.

[Bhakua (Nepal, Bengal, Assam); Catla, Catal, Katla, Katol (India); 
<i>Labeo catla</i> (formerly <i>Gibelion catla</i> (formerly 
<i>Catla catla</i>))]
<p>
This fish is found in rivers in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and 
Burma. It is the most heavily farmed fish in South Asia, and has been 
introduced to other regions. This is a popular eating carp in India, 
where 2 to 4 pound (1 to 2kg) fish are preferred by consumers. They can 
grow to over 6 feet (180cm) and  86 pounds (38.6kg). Native wild 
populations are common, so they are IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

<img src="img/sf_carpbrm02e.jpg" alt="Live Carp Bream, live" class=mrg></a>
[Carp Bream, Bronze Bream; <i>Abramis brama</i>]
<p>
The Common Bream is a highly commercial fish from Central Europe to 
Central Asia. It was once an important food for the poor in Britain, 
but the flesh has been described as "bony, insipid and soft". It can 
grow to 32 inches and 13 pounds but is more typically 12 to 20 inches 
and 4 to 9 pounds. Juveniles are often mistaken for 
<a href="sf_carpz.html#silvbrm">Silver Bream</a>, but the scales of this fish are 
smaller. Count from the leading edge of the dorsal fin down to the 
lateral line 13 or more scale rows (11 max for the Silver Bream). This 
fish is not found in North America, but is imported salted and dried. 
IUCN listed as LC (Least Concern).

<br><a href="sf_carpcoz.html">
<img src="img/sf_carpy10e.jpg" alt="Whoel Common Carp 10e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Cyprinus carpio carpio</i>] 
<p>
Possibly originating in the Danube river, these fish have been 
transplanted all around the world and have become pests in some areas. 
They can grow to 80 pounds and 47 inches long but the photo specimen 
was 25-3/4 inches and weighed 7 pounds.</p>
<p>This is a highly commercial fish just about everywhere except North 
America, where fancy varieties are used mainly as a landscaping accent. 
Common Carp prefer larger lakes and slow moving streams with muddy 
bottoms and eat just about anything. Wild carp and decorative koi 
tend to be less deep of body and without the distinct hump typical of 
farmed carp. IUCN Red Listed VU (Vulnerable, wild in their native 
rivers).

<br><a href="sf_carpcrz.html">
<img src="img/sf_carpcr05e.jpg" alt="Live Crucian Carp 03e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Carassius carassius</i>]
<p>
Native to Europe through Siberia and into China, this highly 
commercial carp is both farmed and caught wild, Crucians can grow to 
25 inches and 6.6 pounds but are more commonly between 1 and 3 pounds. 
They are found throughout European lakes, streams and rivers, and as 
far north as Finland. It can be told from the very similar looking 
Prussian carp by it's more golden color, it's tail is not so deeply 
forked, and by the thin lining of the body cavity being white, whereas 
it is black for the Prussian. It also has a more rounded snout than 
other carp.</p>
<p>The Crucian Carp has an amazing ability to survive for months with 
almost no oxygen. This is an adaption to allow survival in ponds that 
are frozen over and covered with snow, ponds predators can't survive 
in.IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

[<i>Cirrhinus molitorella</i> (Asia)  - similar but not commercial, 
<i>Leuciscus leuciscus</i> (Europe)]
<p>
A common fish in fast moving fresh (or sometimes brackish) waters with 
a worldwide distribution in temperate climates. Dace is commonly 
categorized as a "course" fish and not used much for food in North 
America or Europe, but is quite popular in Asia for making fish balls.
</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 11-3/4 inches long and weighed 10-1/4 ounces, 
fairly typical. Some markets also have trays of small dace. The photo specimen 
was 4-1/2 inches long and weighed 5/8 ounce, but the tray contained fish from 
1/4 ounce to 1-3/8 ounces. In Cambodia small dace are used to make prahoc, 
a pungent fermented fish condiment, but I use them differently.

[Dagaa (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya); Mukene (Uganda); Omena (Kenya); 
Silver Cyprinid, Lake Victoria Sardine; <i>Rastrineobola argentea</i>]
<p>
This is an important food fish caught in Lake Victoria and other lakes 
and rivers feeding into the Nile.  Dagaa is silver with a prominent 
lateral stripe and a lateral line that is very low on the body. It grows 
to a little over 3 inches (8 cm) long. It is caught at night using lights, 
then sun dried, sold and distributed through the southern East African 
region for use as both human food and chicken feed. IUCN Red Listed LC 
(Least Concern).

<h2>Goldfish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_carpgf02h.jpg" alt="Live Goldfish 02h" class=mrg>
[Gold Crucian, <i>Carassius auratus auratus</i>]
<p>
A Siberian carp introduced throughout the world, generally pictured in a 
small bowl with a cat trying to get at it. This fish is actually the 
Prussian Carp (<i>Carassius gibelio</i>) bred for color 
variations. It can grow to 23 inches and 6.6 pounds but will stay small 
if kept in a small aquarium, often around 2 to 4 inches.</p>
<p>It's ability to survive in low oxygen environments made it possible 
to keep goldfish in fishbowls before the advent of aerated aquariums. 
This ability resulted from the Prussian Carp having to live under ice in 
its Siberian homeland.</p>
<p>Goldfish are highly variable in color and fin shape, having been bred 
in China as a decorative for about 1000 years. They are edible but not 
generally eaten except by cats and raccoons. Swallowing live goldfish was 
once a popular stunt among college frat-brats but has long been out of style.

<img src="img/sf_carpgrass18d.jpg" alt="Whole Grass Carp 18d" class=mrg></a>
[Rehu (India); <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>]
<p>
A silver bodied fresh water fish imported from Asia, the grass carp 
can grow to 59 inches and nearly 100 pounds, but the photo specimen was 
27 inches and 8.4 pounds. Grass carp are voracious eaters of underwater 
vegetation and are an important food fish in Asia, both farmed and 
caught wild.</p>
<p>Use of triploid (sterile) grass carp to control invasive aquatic 
weeds was pioneered in the Imperial Valley of California. Triploids are 
created by slightly damaging eggs immediately after fertilization. 
They  grow to only 40 pounds in the irrigation channels and live half 
as long as diploid carp but they eat about 90% as much and won't establish 
wild populations where they are not wanted. The California hatchery has 
been studied by teams from many states and countries.

Siamese Mud Carp; <i>Henicorhynchus siamensis</i>]
<p>This small carp is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins 
of Vietnam and Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. They can grow to 7-3/4 
inches, but are usually quite a bit smaller. The photo specimen was 
the largest in a tray of frozen carp, at 4-3/4 inches long. Nearly all 
the rest were 3-1/2 inches or smaller. Wild caught in Vietnam. In 
Southeast Asia they are primarily used to make fermented fish sauces, 
such as prahoc and nuoc mam, but are also deep fried or used in soup.
They are a commercial catch, but IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

This is a popular eating carp in India, and heavily farmed there. They 
are commonly 16 inches (40cm) long, but can be over 39 inches (100cm) 
and weigh as much as 28 pounds (12.7kg). Native wild populations are 
now found only in the Kaveri River, which flows through Tamil Nadu, 
India, so they are IUCN rated VU (Vulnerable). It has been introduced 
to other regions. The photo specimen was caught in Hainan, China.  For

[<i>Carassius gibelio</i>]
<p>   
This carp may have originated in eastern Asia or Siberia, but is 
now also found through most of Europe. It is a fast breeder and can 
becomes a pest where introduced. This fish is often confused with the 
<a href="sf_carpcrz.html">Crucian Carp</a>, which has caused it 
to be accidentally stocked where it was not wanted. The Crucian is 
considered more desirable commercially. They can be told apart by 
the more golden color of the Crucian, by the more deeply forked 
tail of the Prussian, and the thin lining of the body cavity is black, 
whereas it is white in the Crucian. This fish can grow to about 14 
inches (some sources say 17 inches), but the photo specimen was 11 
inches and weighed 1 pound 1-3/4 ounces.

[<i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i>]
<p>   
This is an Asian carp that has been introduced worldwide for food and 
for cleaning algae out of lakes and reservoirs - though it often 
becomes a pest. This fish, like the closely related 
<a href="sf_carpbhz.html">Bighead Carp</a>, is a plankton eating 
filter feeder, but it feeds a little deeper than the Bighead. It is 
the worlds most important farmed fish, but it only began to to appear 
in Southern California's Asian markets in 2012. By 2015 It could 
be found both in the live fish tanks and frozen.</p>
<p>This fish is a major pest in the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio 
and Missouri rivers. While the photo specimen was just just 13 inches 
long and weighed only 12-1/8 ounces, they can grow to well over 40 
pounds and leap 10 feet out of the water when startled. Many
recreational boaters in fast ski boats have been injured and even 
killed by leaping fish. Contests are held to catch as many as 
possible, but there is no effective control method - except to eat 
them all. They are notably delicious, but as with any other carp, 
you have to get accustomed to dealing with the spines, something 
which most of the world has accomplished. &nbsp;
