[<i>Clarias batrachus</i> (Southeast Asian), also <i>C. gareipinus</i> 
  (North African) and hybrids of the two]
<p>
This air breathing catfish quickly becomes a pest in subtropical 
   regions, especially since it can travel fairly long distances over land 
   from one body of water to another. Brought to Florida for fish farming, 
   it escaped and is now notorious for invading fish farms and eating all 
   the fish.</p>
   <p>Native to Southeast Asia, the walking catfish can grow to over 18 
   inches and over 2-1/2 pounds but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 
   1-1/2 pounds. Hybrids with the North African variety can be much larger, 
   and that variety itself can grow to 120 pounds.</p>

The flesh of the Walking Catfish is darker than that of other commercial 
catfish but not markedly different in flavor. The flesh remains firm and 
does not flake apart with moderate cooking so it's a good fish for soups 
and stews.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This catfish can be found in many Philippine and 
East Asian fish markets. It is easily recognizable by it's almost full 
length dorsal fin. It is often labeled "Yellow Catfish", but that's 
properly a completely different fish, the

<h3>Prep <small>&amp;</small> Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This fish works pretty 
much like any other catfish. The bones are large and easily avoided so it 
can be filleted easily or you can just cut the fish into segments and 
toss them into a soup as is done in many ethnic restaurants. The head is 
solid bone and to remove the gills (and rudimentary lungs) you have to 
use kitchen shears to snip under the front of the jaw, then hinge the 
bottom back as shown.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The 1-1/2 pound fish in the photo yielded 13 oz of 
skin-on fillet (54%) and 11 ounces skinned (46%).<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> The head and bones make a light fish stock of typical 
catfish flavor - liked by some and disliked by others. See
