  Shovelhead Catfish, <i>Pylodictis olivaris</i>]
<p>
This catfish is native to the Mississippi River drainage basin from the 
lower Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi. Because it's such 
a popular game fish it has been introduced to other rivers, generally 
with severe negative impact on native fish populations. Most catfish are 
scavengers, but this one is a predator. In adulthood it eats nothing but 
other fish. This fish can grow to about 4 feet long and over 120 pounds.

<p>This catfish is very edible but considered not quite as good as the 
Channel Catfish or the Blue Catfish - but it gets nearly as large as the 
Blue.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is not farmed commercially - it's diet 
of live fish would make that too costly, so it is not available outside 
the region where it can be caught wild. For the most part it is a sport 
fish.<p></p>

<h3>Prep &amp; Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Except for its carnivorous diet and 
brown or yellow color this catfish is pretty much like others. See the 
page for <a href="sf_cataz.html"><b>Channel Catfish</b></a> for 
details.<p></p>
