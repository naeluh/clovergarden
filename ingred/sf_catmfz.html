[Striped Dwarf Catfish; C&aacute; Chot (Vietnam); Trey kanchos chhnoht

&nbsp; | &nbsp; Pa kha gneng khang lai (Laos); Trey kanchos chhnoht 
(Cambodia); <i>Mystus multiradiatus</i> - Family <i>Bagridae </i> 
(Bagrid catfishes)]
<p>
Native to the Mekong (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam) and Chao Phraya 
(Thailand) river basins of Southeast Asia, these fish can grow to a shade 
over 5 inches long. They often form schools of both species, but 
<i>M. mysticetus</i> can be told apart because you can see it's eyes 
from the underside, and <i>M. multiradiatus</i> has a rounder anal fin. 
These are a well known fish in Vietnam, where they are harvested when 
the rice paddies start to dry and they head for the river.

<p>This fish is quite popular in Vietnam, and is used in sour fish 
soups and braised in a chili lemongrass sauce. It can also be dusted 
with rice flour, fried and eaten with a dip. It should be prepared as 
described below for any method of cooking.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These fish are sold both "head-off" and 
"head-on". The instructions below are for "head-on".  These fish can 
often be found in the freezer cases of some of the large Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, neatly arranged in foam trays. The photo 
specimens, wild caught in Vietnam, were purchased at 2016 US $1.69 for 
a tray of 57 fish, weighing 12 ounces after thawing. The larger of the 
two fish in the photo was 4-1/8 inches long and weighed 0.33 ounce. 
Average weight for the whole package was 0.21 ounce (6 grams) per fish.
</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; These fish have three strong, needle sharp 
spines you should carefully avoid - one each on their pectoral fins, and 
one at the leading edge of the dorsal fin.</p>
<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; They're catfish so they don't have scales, and 
are not kosher.</p>
<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is a little tedious, but not difficult.
It is fastest to do each step on all the fish before going on to the 
next step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Thaw the fish. A cold water thaw will work fine.</li>
<li>Using sharp kitchen shears, cut off the head at the back of the hard 
  part. This will be a little in front of the sharp dorsal fin spine. 
  Cut diagonally, taking off the pectoral fins and their sharp spines.
  </li>
<li>Using the shears, cut off the dorsal fin, cutting deep enough so 
  take a tiny bit of the flesh with the fin. This gets rid of the third 
  sharp spine. It is most accurate to cut from the aft end of the 
  fin forward.</li>
<li>Using the shears, cut from the front diagonally just enough to 
  cut off the pelvic fins at the bottom of the fish. This will open 
  up the belly for cleaning.</li>
<li>Cut off the tail if desired. It can be left on if you will be 
  serving the fish just dusted with rice flour and fried, but for soups 
  and stews, cut it off.</li>
<li>Scrape out the innards and rinse out under running water. The belly 
  will be wide open so it takes only a moment to scrape everything out 
  with a fingernail.</li>
  </ol>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; 12 ounces of thawed fish yielded 6-1/2 ounces 
(54%) cleaned as described above. This is with the backbone left in.</p>
