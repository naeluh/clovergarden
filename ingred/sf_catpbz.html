[Madhu Pabda (Bangladesh); <i>Ompok pabda</i> of family  <i>Siluridae</i> 
(Sheatfishes)]
<p>
This fish is found in rivers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, 
Bangladesh and Burma, and is particularly popular in the cuisines 
of West Bengal and Bangladesh. It can grow to 11 inches, but is more 
commonly around 6 inches. IUCN Red listed NT (Near Threatened).

<p>While popular in West Bengal and Bangladesh (formerly East Bengal) 
Pabda is not available in North America. Since it is a 
<a href="sf_catsz.html">Sheatfish</a>, a different sheatfish would seem 
a natural substitute - but not easy to find outside Los Angeles. If you 
can not find sheatfish, I suggest using the now very common 
<a href="sf_catvnz.html">Vietnamese Catfish</a> (Basa, Swai). American 
Channel Cat has a different shape and more assertive flavor, so would 
not be as good a substitute.</p>

<p>Most Bengali recipes call for cooking Pabda whole, certainly possible 
with other Sheatfish, but not with Vietnamese catfish. On the other hand, 
most Americans aren't thrilled with fish staring back at them from the 
plate, never mind dealing with fins, so fillets would be just fine. 
While small Swai fillets can sometimes be found, larger ones could be 
cut into chunks, perhaps about 2 inches by 5 inches. </p>

<p>One of my Bengali cookbooks, written by a real Bengali, suggests 
"Whiting" which she describes as a "close cousin" to Pabda, which 
would certainly not be true of any whiting listed on Fishbase. Most 
whiting are hake, of the cod family, except in Southeast Asia and 
Australia where they are Sillago, no closer to Pabda than Hake, and 
unlikely to be widely available in New York where she lives. The weight 
she gives by count of whole fish would be only 5 ounces each, rather 
small for Hake Whiting - so I really don't know what it is they're 
selling as "whiting" in New York.</p>
