[Bleeker's Sheatfish; Pla Daeng (Viet); Pa Nang Ngeun (Laos); 
Pla Nuea On (Thai); Trey Kes (Cambodia) <i>Phalacronotus bleekeri</i> 
syn. <i>Micronema bleekeri</i> of family <i>Siluridae</i> (Sheatfishes)]
<p>
   <p>This fish can grow to nearly  24 inches, but the photo specimen 
   would have been 16 inches (if the packing company hadn't broken off 
   the tail fin) and weighed 14 ounces. Note: tail has been artificially 
   restored in photo. They are caught wild and farmed, IUCN rated LC 
   (Least Concern).</p>

<p>The flesh is tender and very mild without noticeable "catfishy" 
flavor, and tends to have a yellowish cast due to fat. That color isn't 
noticeable after cooking.  Because the flesh is extremely tender this 
fish cannot be used in soups and stews as regular catfish can. It can 
be poached if cut into reasonable lengths.</p>

<p>This fish is flat and can easily be fried or steamed whole or pan 
dressed. Filleting is not difficult though, and yield is good with a 14 
ounce fish yielding 7.5 ounces of fillet (54%) - that's skin-on because 
that's the way catfish is usually cooked. The skin is very thin and when 
fried shrinks a little and then relaxes. There are some very substantial 
centerline spines right at the front that should be pulled.</p>

Small specimens of this fish are also sold and are more practical than 
many other small fish you find in Asian markets. The photo specimen was 
9 inches long and weighed 1.8 ounces.  A 2.3 ounce fish yielded 1.2 
ounces of fillet (52%).</p>
<p>Fried, the bottom fin becomes crisp and edible and the flesh is easy 
to eparate from the bones. Steamed the flesh also separates easily, but 
I recommend pulling the bottom fin before serving which makes eating much 
easier. I prefer them fried with a light dusting of rice flour.</p>
