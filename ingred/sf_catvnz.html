On the Internet, there are more outright lies about these fish than just 
about any other food item - lies spread mainly by unethical 
catfish farmers who, faced with competition, chose smear campaigns and 
political manipulation rather than improving their methods to compete. 
See <a href="sf_catvnz.html#wars">Catfish Wars</a> below.</p>
<p>Is it safe to eat? Yes, it has been confirmed as safe as American 
catfish by independent testing labs, major food distributors (and their 
insurance companies), and the U.S. Federal Government. They are very low 
in mercury and are also also easier on the environment than most farmed 
fish. They are omnivores and can be grown on mostly vegetable matter 
rather than the wild caught fish and crustaceans many other farmed fish 
require.</p>
<p>Vietnamese catfish, a genus known as "Shark Catfish" from their shape, 
are quite different from American Channel Catfish. It takes quite a bit 
of careful trimming to make fillets that are interchangeable with 
American fillets. They still vary slightly, being wider, thinner and 
more delicate in flavor and texture. In the Mekong these fish can grow 
to over 3 feet long, but farmed fish are harvested much smaller. The 
photo specimen, <i>P. bocourti</i>, was 17-1/4 inches long and weighed 
2 pounds 6 ounces.</p>

<p>Two varieties are widely farmed, <b>Basa</b> (<i>P. pangasius</i>) 
and <b>Swai / Tra</b> (<i>P. hypophthalmus</i>), but what is shipped to 
the U.S. is mostly Swai. Basa is preferred in Vietnam but, since U.S. 
buyers don't care, the faster growing Swai is shipped. Swai fillets 
are thinner and a little coarser than Basa.</p>

Pictured to the left is the form you will find sold in markets 
here in North America - nicely cleaned and frozen fillets. This form 
is described by exporters as: "belly off, fat off, red meat off".</p>
<p>Fillets can weigh anywhere between 2 ounces to over 11 ounces, but 
they are sold in bags containing only a single size. These fillets can 
be used in place of regular catfish, or for many fish recipes not 
traditionally used with catfish. Most Americans don't even know Swai 
is catfish. The fillets are light in flavor (just a bit too light in 
my opinion), and stay firm enough for most methods of cooking where 
fillets are called for.

<h2>Whole Basa</h2>
<p>Most Americans have never seen a Basa or Swai in it's natural form. 
Nor had I, but back in early 2011 I felt myself fortunate to find 
frozen ones in a very large Asian market here in Los Angeles. Now, 
over a year later, they are easily found on ice in the Philippine
markets. The 2011 model was very skillfully factory cleaned by making 
a small cut under the jaw. For the photo and uncleaned weight I 
reversed this by stuffing the fish with wet paper towels.</p>
<p>Like any other catfish, Basa and Swai have no scales (so are not 
kosher). They are fairly easy to clean and fillet, though there is a 
heavy bone extending from the top of the head up to the dorsal fin. 
It's best to fillet from the top down to the backbone, then over the 
backbone from the tail forward. Cut the rib cage away from the 
backbone with kitchen shears. I then shave the ribs off the belly 
with the filleting knife, if I have a use for the fatty belly. 
There are no centerline pin bones to deal with - the filets will be 
entirely bone free.</p>

<p>The photo shows the fillet cut from the Basa at the top of the page, 
including the first trimming cuts. At the top of the photo is the part 
that is further prepared for export to North America. Bottom left is 
the belly, which is mostly fat and not particularly appetizing. Lining 
the inside of the belly are additional large deposits of fat, some of 
which is shown to the lower right. In Vietnam, local uses are found 
for these offcuts.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_basa07f.jpg" alt="Skin Side of fillet" class=mrg>
For many uses you will want to remove the skin, because it has a 
stronger taste and shrinks significantly when heated, enough to curl 
the fillets. Skinning these fillets is very easy by the long knife 
and cutting board method - the skin is strong and cooperative.</p>

<p>For some uses, particularly catfish soups, the skin is left on. 
In Vietnam the famous Sweet and Sour Catfish Soup is made with cross 
cut steaks with skin and bones. I usually cut up skin-on fillets for 
these soups.</p>

<p>To the left is shown the skin side of a skin-off fillet, displaying 
the considerable amount of "red meat". This has a stronger, more oily 
taste,  and is removed for the fillet to be in the form usually 
exported. I don't know how they do that, but they do a very nice job 
of it. For most catfish uses I prefer the red meat left on so the 
fillet has more of a catfish taste. These days I usually buy a frozen 
fish that has been cleaned and beheaded, but is otherwise whole with 
skin on. These are available from the huge San Gabriel Superstore 
here in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find the head, bones and fins simmered for 1/2 
hour made a quite serviceable stock without a strong flavor.

<h2 id="wars">The Catfish Wars</h2>

<p>Seeing competition from Vietnam, American catfish farmers organized an 
expedition to that country to gather dirt for a propaganda campaign. They 
found no dirt. As one catfish man said, "We went expecting to find catfish 
raised in polluted waters and processed in primitive facilities. That's 
not what we found, and we're scared to death".</p>

<p>With the actual truth solidly against them by their own admission, 
American catfish farmers have proven less ethical than even the Congress 
critters they seek to "influence". They have succeeded in getting 
legislation passed interfering with imports of Vietnamese fish, though 
that success has turned into a sort of comedy of errors. They have also 
spread lying articles all over the Internet, some so absurd only Tea 
Party members could believe them. Their advertising campaigns have been 
denounced as deception and half truths even by the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>Some Internet articles have even played the "mercury in fish" card. 
Mercury is a problem only with large predatory fish living in the oceans - 
and not much of a problem even there. Vietnamese catfish is a freshwater 
fish and not a predator, so mercury is not a concern.</p>

<p>At the behest of the catfish farmers, Congress passed a law that only 
"Channel Catfish" could be called "Catfish" in the United States, 
preventing some 2000 other species of catfish from being called catfish. 
Distributors briefly called Vietnamese catfish "China Sole", but that 
was a bit deceptive, so they settled on "Basa". That was also a little 
inaccurate, because what was being shipped here was mostly Swai. 
Americans can't tell the two apart, but the Vietnamese can, and keep the 
Basa for themselves. Vietnamese catfish is now packaged and sold mostly 
as "Swai", which is accurate.</p>

<p>The major effect of this name change is that Americans who think they 
don't like catfish now buy this fish and enjoy it - but it gets even 
worse for the catfish farmers. The Chinese started raising Channel Cat for 
export to the United States. As is usual in Chinese practice, the product 
was often adulterated. This caused the Feds to require extra testing (at 
extra cost). Knowing the Chinese would find a way to sneak their fish in 
disguised as American raised catfish, the testing is required for 
<u>all</u> catfish. This means added cost for American catfish growers 
as well.</p>
 
<p>Now, guess who's catfish doesn't need to pay the inspection cost 
because it can't be called "Catfish". So the catfish farmers went back to 
Congress asking for the Vietnamese to be forced to call their product 
"Catfish". They also asked for import control to be transferred from the 
FDA to the USDA, a process that could have stopped Vietnamese imports for 
up to three years. Both these efforts have failed - so far.</p>
<p>Of course the American catfish industry is actually suffering, and 
production has declined, but it's not primarily from Vietnamese 
competition. The main cause is much higher feed costs resulting from 
Congress's brain dead "Food into SUV Fuel" ethanol program.</p>
