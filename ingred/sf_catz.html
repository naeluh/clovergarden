<h1>Catfish Order</h1>
<br><img  src="img/sf_catblue01g.jpg" alt="Illustration of Blue Catfish 01g" class=mrg>
[Order <i>Siluriformes</i>]
<p>
There are some 2200 species of catfish in as many as 40 families and many 
genera. The greatest number of species is found Central and South America 
(including one recently discovered in Mexico that may have been around 
since dinosaur days). Some catfish are ocean fish but most live in fresh 
water. Catfish do not have scales but some species are covered with 
overlapping armor plates.</p>
<p>No scales means catfish are not kosher, so observant Jews need to use 
Carp (and deal with the spines) or Tilapia instead. Carp is traditional 
in Europe but some think Tilapia is the fish Jesus distributed along with 
loaves.</p>

<p>The heaviest catfish are Mekong giant catfish (<i>Pangasianodon 
gigas</i>) which can reach 9 feet and over 600 pounds. Unfortunately they 
are currently listed as critically endangered and should not be fished or 
eaten. The longest is the Eurasian Wels catfish (<i>Silurus glanis</i>) 
which can reach nearly 10 feet and 330 pounds. This fish is common in 
central, southern and eastern Europe, in the Baltic region and the 
Caspian Sea. It is currently IUC Red Listed as LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Catfish generally have strong sharp spines at 
the leading edges of their fins which can cause puncture wounds, and these 
spines are associated with poison glands. Toxicity of North American cat
fish ranges from "not much" to requiring some medical attention, but at 
least one South American species is deadly, and a few others there will 
land you in the hospital.

large page).

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>

<p>Only a few species are fished and farmed commercially, with the U.S. 
South and Vietnam as the major producers of catfish sold in North America. 
Asian markets in Los Angeles sell several varieties of catfish from under 
1 pound to over 6 pounds, some of the smaller are available live from the 
store's fish tanks.</p>

<p>We have separate articles on each of the types most available 
commercially in North America:</p>

   [Channel Catfish <i>Ictalurus punctatus</i> of Family <i>Ictaluridae</i>]
   <p>
   Catfish farming is a sizeable industry in the U.S. where the Channel 
   Cat  dominates. Most catfish are grown (and consumed) in the Southern 
   States but they are widely available in the rest of North America. The 
   photo  specimen weighed 4 pounds 1-3/8 ounces (factory cleaned) and was 
   24 inches long.

   [<i>Ameiurus melas</i> (Black Bullhead) | <i>Ameiurus nebulosus</i> 
   (Brown Bullhead) | <i>Ameiurus natalis</i> (Yellow Bullhead)]
   <p>
   Bullheads are a variety of American freshwater catfish that inhabits 
   slow moving backwaters with soft bottoms. They differ from most 
   catfish in having squared off tails and being relatively small in size. 
   </p>
   <p>These fish can grow to over 24 inches and nearly 8 pounds, but are 
   commonly about 10 inches and 1 pound (<i>A. natalis</i> a little 
   smaller). <i>A. melas</i> has been introduced to Europe where it forms 
   dense stunted populations, making it rather unpopular. These fish 
   tolerate very adverse conditions, so it's unlikely they'll be able to 
   get rid of them now. The photo specimen, probably <i>A. melas</i> or 
   a hybrid, was 12-1/2 inches long and weighed 1 pound 4-1/2 ounces.

<p>
   On the Internet, there are more outright lies about these fish than 
   just about any other food item - lies spread mainly by unethical 
   catfish farmers. Faced with competition, these farmers chose smear 
   campaigns and political manipulation rather than improve their methods 
   to compete. These catfish are very different from American catfish and 
   require extensive preparation to be marketable here, so for some time 
   only frozen fillets were being sent to North America. By late 2013, 
   whole fish started appearing in the Asian and Philippine markets here. 
   Fillets may range from 2 ounces to over 11 ounces, sold in bags of a 
   single size.</p>
   <p>Two varieties are widely farmed, <b>Basa</b> (<i>P. pangasius</i>) 
   and <b>Swai / Tra</b> (<i>P. hypophthalmus</i>), but what is shipped 
   to North America is mostly Swai. Basa is preferred in Vietnam, but, 
   since American buyers don't care, the faster growing Swai is shipped. 
   Swai fillets are thinner and a little coarser than Basa.

   [<i>Clarias batrachus</i> - also hybrids with <i>C. gareipinus</i>, 
   North African sharptooth catfish]
   <p>
   This air breathing catfish quickly becomes a pest in subtropical 
   regions, especially since it can travel fairly long distances over 
   land from one body of water to another. Brought to Florida for fish 
   farming, it escaped and is now notorious for invading fish farms and 
   eating all the fish. Native to Southeast Asia, it can grow to over 18 
   inches and over 2-1/2 pounds but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 
   1-1/2 pounds. Hybrids with the North African variety can be much 
   larger, and that variety itself can grow to 120 pounds.

   [<i>Clarias gariepinus</i> of Family <i>Clariidae</i>]
   <p>
   This large air breathing catfish is native through most of Africa 
   and the Middle East. It can grow to 5 feet 7 inches and weigh over 
   130 pounds. Farming this fish in Africa has proven so successful it 
   has been taken to Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and India, so it will 
   probably soon show up in the Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles. 
  It is fast growing, spawns easily, can live on agricultural waste and 
   in high density fish ponds. This fish fetches a premium price in many 
   countries because it can be sold live, just kept in a basket of wet 
   straw. See Walking Catfish for <a href="sf_catabz.html"><b>Details

<h2>(Sheatfishes)</h2>
<p>There are many genera and species in this catfish family, but only a 
few are fished and farmed commercially.These fish live mostly in the 
rivers and lakes of Southeast Asia and Southern China, though by far 
the largest, <i>Silurus glanis</i>, is found in the Baltic region of 
Europe and the Black and Aral Sea regions.</p>

   <p>
   Native to the Mekong (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam) and 
   Chao Phraya (Thailand) river basins of Southeast Asia, these fish 
   can grow to a shade over 5 inches long. They often form schools of 
   both species, but <i>M. mysticetus</i> can be told apart because 
   you can see it's eyes from the underside, and <i>M. multiradiatus</i> 
   has a rounder anal fin. These are a well known fish in Vietnam, 
   where they are harvested when the rice paddies start to dry and they 
   head for the river.

   This catfish is native from the Indus River drainage in Pakistan east to 
   Western China. It is well known from the rivers of Central Asia, and  
   has been featured on a Kyrgyztani stamp. This fish can grow to 9.5 
   inches, but is commonly 6 inches long, and prefers fast moving rivers. 
   There are four other Glyptosternon Catfish in the region, but this is 
   the only one I've found any information on.
