[<i>Callinectes sapidus</i>]
<p>
Blue Crabs are found from Nova Scotia to northern Argentina but are 
most abundant from Massachusetts on down and around the coast to Texas. 
They are particularly important to the economy in the Chesapeake Bay area 
of Maryland and Virginia. They can grow to about 9.1 inches across the 
points of the shell, but the photo example was 7 inches and weighed 
8-3/4 ounces.</p>
<p>This is a highly mobile "swimming crab" which will 
travel a couple hundred miles seasonally. It is very active and feisty 
and you don't want to get pinched because the claws are very strong. 
Populations in the Chesapeake Bay have been declining and major 
experimental hatcheries have been established to try to reverse the 
decline. The demand is so great crabs are now being imported from as 
far away as Texas.</p>

<p>Blue Crab flesh is very tender and succulent, but it's a crab you 
eat for the adventure not to fill you up. Eating them is quite a project and 
yield is extremely low, 8% for smaller females to 14% for larger males. 
A 4-1/4 inch 3.8 ounce female crab, carefully picked, yielded 0.3 ounces 
of edible crab (8%). Figure 6 or 7 crabs per person and have plenty of 
other stuff to eat.</p>

<p>Females have red claw tips and males blue claw tips. On the underside 
immature females have a triangular "apron", mature females have a wide 
rounded apron and males have a narrow pointy apron. Males are called 
"Jimmies", immature females "Sally" or "She Crabs" and mature 
females are called "Sook".</p>

<p>Blue crabs are sold by two grading methods, a number system on the 
docks and a size system in commerce (with typically exaggerated size 
designations).</p> 

<ul>
<li><b>#1 Jimmies:</b> largest, meatiest male crabs available.</li>
<li><b>#2 Jimmies:</b> medium size male crabs.</li>
<li><b>#3:</b> ungraded small crabs, nearly all female.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the male crabs go to the East Coast or are sold to fancy 
restaurants elsewhere. #3s (all female) are sent to Southern 
California where they are sold in Philippine fish markets, often for 
less than $1.00/pound.</p>


<p>There are two generally accepted ways to eat these crabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Maryland style:</h3> &nbsp; Here whole live crabs are seasoned 
with a mix of Old Bay Seasoning and salt, then steamed shells, gills, 
guts and all. They're disassembled completely (and messily) at the table. 
The table "cloth" is yesterday's newspaper which can then be rolled up 
with all the mess and disposed of.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>New Jersey style:</h3> &nbsp; Here the crabs are shelled and 
cleaned down to legs and chassis before cooking. This makes them far 
less messy to eat and they can be cooked with fancier sauces and 
seasonings, often in an Italian style. Instructions on this method 
are found below.</li>
</ul>

  </td><td class=top>
  Sedate your crabs - they are not going to be one bit cooperative 
  otherwise. The one in the photo wanted a piece of me really, really 
  bad and those claws are very strong. Sedate them by giving them a good 
  long soak in a tub of ice water (with plenty of ice). They'll still 
  be moving but very sluggish and won't be able to pinch. Being sedated 
  also makes the following steps easier on the crab.

<tr><td class=top><b>2</b></td><td>
  <img src="img/sf_cbblue04h.jpg" alt="Inserting Butter Knife" class=mrg>
  </td><td class=top>
  Holding the outer shell down to the cutting board, get a butter knife 
  in through the mouth parts. Once it's in two or three inches, pry 
  sharply upward to eject the chassis from the shell, still holding the 
  outer shell firmly.
  </td></tr>

<tr><td class=top><b>3</b></td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbblue06h.jpg" alt="Crab is Open" class=mrg>
  </td><td class=top>Bend the shell back off the chassis exposing the 
  gills. Instructions on other sites tell you the above procedure kills 
  the crab instantly but that depends on your definition of "kills". The 
  crab was sedated to start with, is now blind and probably has lost all 
  consciousness, but the body still responds to stimulus for about a 
  minute, so expect some waving of the legs when you move it.
  </td></tr>

<tr><td class=top><b>4</b></td><td class=top>

  </td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbblue10h.jpg" alt="Pulling the Apron" class=mrg>
  Pull off the gills, commonly known as "dead man's 
  fingers".
  <p>Pull back the "apron" on the bottom and break it off. Females have a 
  wide rounded apron as shown in the photo while males have a very narrow 
  pointy apron.</p>
  </td></tr>

<tr><td class=top><b>5</b></td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbblue12h.jpg" alt="Clean out the Goop" class=mrg>
  </td><td class=top>Wash under running water - anything with any color 
  needs to be removed from the inside. A thin chopstick can help you get 
  stuff out of the cavities leaving only translucent white flesh. Use 
  kitchen shears to cut away any extraneous pieces of shell.
  </td></tr>

<tr><td class=top><b>6</b></td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbblue14h.jpg" alt="Crab, Ready to Cook" class=mrg>
  </td><td class=top>
  You should now have a completely cleaned crab chassis with legs and 
  claws attached, all ready to cook by whatever means you please.

  And here we have the finished product, a steamed 
  blue crab ready to eat. For clarity no seasoning or sauces have been 
  applied. Consider a light sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning and salt 
  (half and half) on your plate to touch pieces of crab to as you 
  disassemble it, or my favorite <a href="../recipes/1jx_cgcrab1.html">
  CG Crab Dip</a>.
