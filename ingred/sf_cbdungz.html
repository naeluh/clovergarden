<h1>Dungeness Crab</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_cbdung17f.jpg" alt="Live &amp; Cooked Dungeness Crabs" class=mrg>
[<i>Cancer magister</i>]
<p>
This popular crab is found from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska south to 
Santa Barbara, California and is the most economically important crab on 
the U.S. West Coast. The photo specimens are 6-3/4 inch across the 
carapace, a typical market size. The rear one was purchased pre-cooked 
and the front one live. The live one weighed 1.6 pounds and the cooked 
one 1.3 pounds. These crabs are also sold as "clusters", half a crab 
chassis with legs and claws attached and about 60% of the catch is 
rendered into canned and frozen crab meat.</p>

<p>These crabs can grow to 10 inches across the carapace but few get the 
chance because the fishery is very efficient with between 80% and 90% of 
legal crabs caught in any particular year. Legal crabs are sexually 
mature males greater than 6-1/4" across the carapace. By then they're 
about 4 years old and have had plenty of time to knock up enough females 
to keep the population going. Nearly all the California / Oregon / 
Washington catch is between 15 November and New Years Day, though the 
season goes on to mid July. There are other smaller catches throught 
the crab's full range which keep them available much of the year. 
These crabs are not endangered.</p>

<p>Dungeness crabs are reputed to have the sweetest meat of any crab, 
the flavor is more intensely "crabby" than others and they are definitely 
the most meaty.  Yield from a 1.63 pound crab was 6.5 ounces of crab meat 
(25%), phenomenal for a crab. Unlike most crabs a large amount of the 
meat is in the body and the claws are a bit small.</p>

<p><b>Precooked Crabs:</b> this is a large crab with a lot of gooky stuff 
inside. I find it does discolor some of the flesh and affects its flavor. 
To minimize these effects, before resteaming or otherwising using a 
precooked crab, I recommend following the same procedure as for fresh 
crabs to get them cleaned up.</p>

<p>Commercially crabs are just dumped into boiling water and cooked as-is 
for reasons of economy and presentation. I prefer to clean them first and 
with a little practice cleaning goes quickly.</p>

  Sedate your crabs - they are not going to be at all cooperative 
  otherwise   and their claws can pinch pretty hard (they crush clams 
  with them). Sedate them by giving them a good long soak in a tub of ice 
  water (with plenty of ice). They'll still be moving but very sluggish 
  and won't be able to pinch. Being sedated also makes the following 
  step easier on the crab.  The safest way to handle these crabs is by 
  the shell from the top. You can grab them from behind as with other 
  crabs but it's reported some are flexable enough to get at you there.

  With the crab on its back place a strong kitchen knife down the 
  centerline and hit it with a soft faced mallet to drive it into the 
  crab. This will kill the crab, not instantly but very quickly. If you 
  want the shell intact for stuffing or some other use, make sure the 
  point of the blade doesn't project over the front edge of the crab 
  and don't pound too hard. The knife should go about half way through. 
  You will finish the cut after removing the shell.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td class=top><b>3</b></td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbdung31h.jpg" alt="Remove apron" class=mrg>
  </td><td class=top>With the crab still upside down, bend back the 
  apron and snap it off. The apron will be narrow on all crabs because 
  you should never be preparing a female crab - they are not legal.
  </td></tr>

  Holding the crab's rear legs down where they join the body, hook the 
  thumb of your other hand under the shell where you just broke off the 
  apron and pull it up. This will take a little strength. Pull the shell 
  shell up and forward until it is completely free of the chassis. Much 
  of the gooky stuff will go with the shell.

  </td><td class=top>
  <img src="img/sf_cbdung38h.jpg" alt="Cut in half" class=mrg>
  Pull off the gills (known as "dead man's fingers") and pull off the 
  mouth parts and other loose and removable parts. Finish cutting the 
  chassis in half.
  </td></tr>

  Clean the two halves under running water removing anything that has 
  color and using kitchen shears to cut off any extraneous pieces of 
  shell. You should end up with a completely cleaned crab chassis in two 
  halves with legs and claws attached to each half - all ready to cook by 
  whatever means you please.
