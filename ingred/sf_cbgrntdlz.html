<p>
The Green Tidal Crab inhabits brackish waters and far up rivers. It is 
found from the east coast of Africa to the Mid Pacific Islands, ranging 
from Japan to southern Australia. It is almost identical to the Asian 
Shore Crab that's now a serious invader along the United States east 
coast - except this one swims, so has flatter, hairy legs to help paddle 
upstream. It can grow a little larger, up to 1.8 inches across the 
carapace. Recipes are the same, and in the Philippens they go under the 
same name, Talangka.

The photo to the left is the bottom side of the crab in the top photo. 
The very narrow "apron" shows it is male, females have a very wide apron 
to brood their eggs under. </p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found these crabs in the frozen food 
cases of a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel). They were 
packaged in a foam tray holding 14 ounces of crabs, product of Vietnam. 
Vietnam is a little to far south for the Asian Shore Crab.

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; There are plenty of recipes for these crabs.
<ul>
<li><b>Crab Sauce / Paste:</b> &nbsp;  In Thailand these crabs are often 
  used to make crab sauce similar to that made from Rice Paddy Crabs and 
  Mangrove Crabs. See our instructions <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdcrabsc.html#paste">
  <b>Making Rice Crab Pastes / Sauces</b></a>.</li>
<li><b>Deep Fried Tiny Crabs:</b> &nbsp;  popular in the Philippines and 
  elsewhere in Southeast Asia - sometimes called "Crab Popcorn". See our 
  recipe <a href="../recipes/saf_cbtiny1.html"><b>Tiny Crispy Crabs
  </b></a>.</li>
<li><b>Taba nag Talangka / Aligue</b> &nbsp; This is prepared salted 
  Crab Eggs (Roe) which, for reasons unknown, are called "Crab Fat" in 
  the Philippines. It takes a whole lot of female tiny crabs to make 
  this, but it is now available in jars. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdcrabsc.html"><b>Crab Pastes / Sauces</b></a> page.</li>
<li><b>Ginataang Talangka</b> &nbsp; Philippine &nbsp; This is Green 
Tidal / Asian Shore Crabs cooked in Coconut Milk.</li>
