<h1>King Crab - Alaskan</h1>

<p>
King crabs are not actually crabs but belong to another family of 
Decapods, the Lithodidae. They are thought by to have evolved from hermit 
crabs (also not true crabs). Because of their size and spindly shape they 
are cooked immediately upon capture and broken into legs and claw arms 
which are shipped (generally frozen) to markets.</p>
<p>The three crabs listed in the title are all from Alaska, the Blue King 
being the largest, the Red King second largest and the Golden King 
considerably smaller (thus lower in price). All three are marketed as 
"Alaskan King Crab" and all are pretty much the same red color when 
cooked so you can't tell them apart in the market. The legs and claws in 
the photo were from Russia. The larger of the legs was 18 inches long and 
weighed 14 ounces. The claw was 9.8 inches 
long and weighed 12.5 ounces.   Blue King legs 
can be over 28 inches long.</p>
<p>This crab is difficult to catch and is not considered endangered. It was 
introduced to the Barents sea off Russia in the 1960s and the population 
there has exploded and spread as far away as Norway to the dismay of 
ecologists and many fishermen and the delight of others who enjoy the high 
price they fetch.</p>

<p>The ideal tools for eating King Crab legs and claws are a pair of kitchen 
shears and a pair of chopsticks. A chopstick can be used to push crabmeat 
out of tubular leg parts and the pair can be used for dipping small pieces 
or crab in whatever sauce you may be using.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; You'll be buying arms and legs and steaming them 
lightly to reheat so the yield is better than for whole crabs - most of 
the weight loss has already happened. A 16-1/2 inch 2.8 oz leg with body 
portion attached yielded 1.5 oz of crabmeat (54%) and a 9 inch 5.2 oz 
claw yielded 2.3 oz of crabmeat (44%) so with an average mix you'll 
probably get around 50%.
