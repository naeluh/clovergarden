<p>
Mitten crabs are native to East Asia, from Korea south to Fujian, China. 
They are considered a serious invasive in North American and Europe. 
In California, there was an explosion of these crabs in 1998, but they 
soon imploded and are rarely seen in 2019. They have also invaded 
northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, but have failed to 
establish populations there. They have established populations in several 
European locations. The Chinese have been over-harvesting these crabs, 
and are now considering importing unwanted European crabs to replenish 
stocks.</p>

<p>Mitten Crabs live in fresh water, but when mature, must travel 
downstream in the Autumn to breed in brackish water. The females 
overwinter in deep saltwater, returning to brackish water in the spring, 
where the the larva hatch from the eggs and start moving upstream to 
fresh water. Mature crabs spawn once and die of exhaustion. They can 
grow to 3.9 inches across the carapace, but the photo specimen was 2.7 
inches and weighed 4-3/4 ounces.</p>

The photo to the left is the bottom side of the crab in the top photo. 
The very wide "apron" shows it is female, males have a very narrow 
apron. These crabs are considered a delicacy in China, harvested in the 
Autumn. The most expensive are caught migrating from Yangcheng Lake to 
the Yangtze River for spawning. Females are highly favored for the egg 
mass they contain. The box in which the photo specimen was packed was 
labeled "Female" on all sides.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found these crabs in a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) in a box of four, embedded in a tray 
of ice, 4 to a tray. They were priced at 2019 US $18.99 for a box of 
four, or abut $18.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Those I have found were already cooked, most 
likely steamed. If you can find fresh ones, just steam them.
