Rice paddies across Southeast Asia are often infested with these small 
freshwater crabs. They are considered pests as they eat young rice 
plants. They are hard to get rid of, because, when the paddies dry out, 
they tunnel into the mud and hibernate until the water comes back. 
Nonetheless, they are also an important commercial product, sold 
salt fermented whole, or ground into black crab paste. Both forms are 
used in Laos, Issan (northeastern Thailand) Vietnam and Cambodia, but 
unsalted crabs are also used, often fried whole, or ground up live for 
Bun Reiu Soup. The photo specimen 
(salted) was 1.7 inches across the carapace and weighed 1-7/8 ounces.

<p>Mangrove crabs, about the same size, are an alternative, and will be 
free of parisites that are sometimes found in Paddy Crabs, but they are 
only available along the mangrove coasts.</p>

<p>These whole salted crabs and crab paste made from them are used in 
the famous Green Papaya Salad of Laos and Issan (northeast Thailand).</p>

<p>In Vietnam, fresh crabs are pounded to paste and strained, using the 
juice in a popular soup called B&uacute;n Rieu Cua. The crab juice is 
combined with pig blood, tamarind, rice vinegar, vegetables, seasonings 
and other ingredients. The residue is used to make crab cakes, which 
may also be used in the soup.</p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Whole salted Black Crabs can be found in the 
frozen food cases of some markets here in Los Angeles. The photo 
specimen was purchased from the San Gabriel Superstore in San Gabriel 
in a 14 ounce tray priced at 2017 US $3.56 / pound. The store also had 
14 ounce tubs of the crabs chopped up for $3.41 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; One Thai source says his mother always 
boiled salt fermented crabs before using them in Som Tum salads to 
assure any parasites were killed. This also reduced the saltiness a 
little, but does not damage the flavor. For salads and the like, the 
top shell is pried off and discarded along with the gills under it. 
For pastes, sauces and Bun reiu soup, the whole crab is ground up.
