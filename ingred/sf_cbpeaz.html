[Pinnotheres pisum]
<p>
These crabs, found pretty much worldwide, are parasites on bivalve 
mollusks and some other sea animals. They are totally dependent on 
the host for food, oxygen and protection. They usually do little 
damage to the host, which is still completely edible - just eat the 
crab or discard it, as you please. The photo specimen was 0.41 inches 
across the shell, and was found inside an Asian Littleneck Clam.</p>

<p>While these crabs may startle and distress diners who have not 
previously encountered them, they have long been considered a 
gourmet treat, eaten either raw or cooked. It is reported that 
George Washington liked them scattered over his oyster soup as a 
garnish.</p>
