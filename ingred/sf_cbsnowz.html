[Alaskan Snow Crab, <i>Chionoecetes opilio</i> and other 
<i>Chionoecetes</i> species]
<p>
Snow Crab is too large and spindly to sell fresh, so like King Crab they 
are cooked immediately after capture and sold as "clusters" of legs and 
claws attached to the meaty part of the body. The photo cluster was 13 
inches long and weighed 6.7 ounces.</p>
<p><i>C. opilio</i> is found in the North Atlantic from Main 
to Greenland and in the Pacific from Canada through the Bering Sea and the 
Arctic Ocean around to the Sea of Japan. Several other <i>Chionoecetes</i> 
species also live in that Pacific range and as far south as California.

<p>The ideal tools for eating Snow Crab legs and claws are a pair of 
kitchen shears and a pair of chopsticks. Kitchen shears are far and 
away better at handling crabs than any device sold for the purpose. A 
chopstick can be used to push crabmeat out of tubular leg parts and the 
pair can be used for dipping small pieces or crab in whatever sauce you 
may be using.</p>

<p>You'll be buying arms and legs and steaming them lightly to reheat, so 
the yield is better than for whole crabs - most of the shrinking has 
already happened. A 13 inch 6.7 oz cluster yielded 2.4 oz of crabmeat 
(36%).</p>
