<p>
Soft Shell Crabs are most commonly <a href="sf_cbbluez.html">Blue 
Crabs</a> (due to availability and size). To grow, a crab must periodically 
molt its entire exoskeleton and grow a new larger one. After the molt the 
crab is highly vulnerable for a period of days until the new shell hardens.
This is the "soft shell" crab of commerce.</p>

<p>In Southern California soft shell crabs are commonly served in sushi 
bars where they are very popular. They may also be seen in specialty 
seafood restaurants but not much elsewhere. Along the Southeast Coast and 
the Gulf Coast they are served more generally.</p>

<p>Soft Shell Crabs should, like any other crab, be purchased live, but 
in many regions they can only be had frozen. If frozen, thaw in cold 
running water just before cooking.</p>

<li>With kitchen shears cut off the face of the crab just behind the eyes. 
This will kill live crabs immediately.</li>
<li>Pry up one side of the carapace and pull out the spongy gills (dead 
man's fingers), then do the other side. See photo to the left.</li>
<li>Turn the crab over and pull the apron (tail) away from the body and 
break it off.</li>
<li>The crabs will now generally be lightly dusted with flour and pan fried 
or deep fried and eaten whole with some sort of seasoning.</li>
