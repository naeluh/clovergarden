[Florida Stone Crab, <i>Menippe mercenaria</i>]
<p>
Stone crabs are found from North Carolina down and along the Gulf coast as 
far south as Belize. They are small bodied with a carapace 4 inches in width 
when fully grown. The body has very little meat but this crab has outsized 
claws with enough strength to break oyster shells.</p>
<p>The fishery is unique and highly regulated in the U.S.. Live crabs are 
taken only during season and if both claws meet a size standard the larger 
is twisted off at a joint and the crab is returned to the water to grow a 
new claw (takes about a year). Taking whole crabs is illegal as is taking 
both claws.</p>

<p>Stone crab claws are cooked immediately upon landing and are kept 
refrigerated. They are shipped all over the U.S. by overnight express 
packed in styrofoam with iced gel packs.</p>

<p>Stone crab claws are served quite plain, either well chilled or 
resteamed. Condiments may be just melted butter and lemon wedges or 
something like <a href="../recipes/2jx_joescrab1.html">Joe's Mustard 
Sauce</a>. Persnonally, I consider Joe's sauce way to strong - if I'm 
paying for crab I want to taste crab. Consequently, I've made up an 
altrnate dip, <a href="../recipes/1jx_cgcrab1.html">CG Crab Dip</a> 
that's not so overpowering. Of course some of the Southeast Asian dips 
to be found on this site will work fine too.
