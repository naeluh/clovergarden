<p>
Circumpolar in both freshwater and saltwater, the Arctic Char can live 
farther north and in colder waters than any other fish. There is also 
a substantial population  Alpine lakes in Switzerland and Italy, probably 
stranded there by some Ice Age.</p><p>This fish can grow to 33 
pounds and 42 inches but is usually marketed at between 2 and 5 pounds. 
In color it can range from gray to gray above and red below. The photo 
specimen is from S&uuml;dtirol, in Alpine Italy. This fish is now farmed 
in Canada, Iceland, Norway, Ireland and West Virginia. In the wild it is 
listed as "LC" (least concern) by the IUCN, and rated "Best Choice" by 
the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

<p>Char is an important fish in Switzerland, along with perch and trout, 
and in the northernmost parts of Europe.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; As you might expect from the name, Arctic Char is 
not common here in Sunny Southern California (or most of the rest of the 
world). Perhaps one of the markets around here serving a Russian community 
has it smoked or canned, but it would be labled in Russian, so how 
would I know?</p>

<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; The photo in my Swiss cookbook shows Char, but the 
ingredient list, presuming you can't get char, calls for Perch. Species-wise, 
though, I'd think Rainbow Trout would be closer. In Europe "Perch" usually 
means Zander, which is perfectly interchangeable with American Walleye.</p>
