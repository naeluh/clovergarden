<h1>Char Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_troutb01g.jpg" alt="Live Brook Trout 01g" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Salmonidae</i> Genus <i>Salvelinus</i>]
<p>
Char are closely related to <a href="sf_charz.html#salmon">Salmon</a> and 
<a href="sf_charz.html#trout">Trout</a>, and a number of species are popularly called 
"Trout". Among these are Brook trout (northeastern North America), Bull 
trout (northwestern North America), Dolly Varden trout (northern 
California around to Russia), and Lake trout (Alaska, Canada, 
northeastern U.S. and introduced to northern Europe and Asia). The lake 
trout is the largest char, growing to just over 100 pounds.<p>

[<i>Salvelinus alpinus alpinus</i>]
<p>
Circumpolar in both freshwater and saltwater, the Arctic Char can live 
farther north and in colder waters than any other fish. It can grow to 33 
pounds and 42 inches but is usually marketed at between 2 and 5 pounds. 
In color it can range 
from gray to gray above and red below. The photo specimen is from 
S&uuml;dtirol, in Alpine Italy. This fish is now farmed in Canada, Iceland, 
Norway, Ireland and West Virginia. In the wild it is listed as "LC" 
(least concern) by the IUCN, and farming is approved by the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium.

<h2>R&ouml;tel</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_rotel01e.jpg" alt="Live Rotel 01e" class=mrg>
[Lake Char; Storr&ouml;ding (Sweden); <i>Salvelinus umbla</i>]
<p>
This red bellied trout-like char is native to the alpine regions of 
Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy, and has been reported from 
Sweden. It can grow to 29 inches, but there are dwarf populations in 
many high Alpine lakes. I have seen R&ouml;tel described as a "perch" 
in cookbooks, but cookbooks tend to call a lot of things "perch". 
IUCN Red listed LC (Least Concern), but these fish were driven to 
near extinction between 1950 and 1979 by eutrophication caused by 
detergent, fertilizer and sewage runoff. While several other lake 
fish were driven to extinction, this one survived, and populations 
have slowly recovered since polution controls were instituted.

[<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>]
<p>
Actually a Char, not a Trout, Brook Trout live along most of the east 
coast of Canada and down to Georgia in the United States, including 
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage basin. They can grow 
to 34 inches and 20 pounds but are more commonly around 10 inches.  Brook 
trout are now being farmed to some extent, and sold fresh, frozen and 
smoked. They are also raised in hatcheries for restocking streams and 
lakes, and have been introduced to other parts of the world. They are 
environmentally sensitive so are much used for environmental research.
