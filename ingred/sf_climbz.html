<h1>Climbing Perch</h1>

[<i>Anabas testudineus</i>]
<p>
Not actually a perch, this fish is a member of family <i>Anabantidae</i> 
(Climbing gouramies - a different family from 
<a href="sf_gourmz.html">Gouramies</a> proper). Able to tolerate 
extremely bad water conditions, this is an air breathing fish that can 
survive for weeks out of the water if it's kept damp. It can't actually 
climb trees though - individuals found in trees were left by birds.</p>
<p>Most climbing gourami species live in Africa and are too small to eat 
but this large one is found from India to China and considered a delicacy 
in Southeast Asia. It's both caught wild and farmed.  The photo specimen 
was bout as large as they get at 9-7/8 inches, and weighed 11-3/8 ounces, 
but 6 inches is more typical.</p>

<p>This is a rather strange fish, and not one I would seek out, but I 
sometimes buy it when the price is low. It probably has more appeal to 
people who were brought up with it. Ability to invade rice paddies and 
other temporarily flooded areas would make it available where other 
fish are not.</p>

<p>The flesh is medium colored and has a definite flavor which is not too 
strong and I find it easy to get used to. The flavor is more intense 
in the skin. The flesh may feel oily until cooked.</p>

<p>I have no idea how these are prepared and eaten in Asia, but due to 
the unusual structure of the fish I find no practical way to eat it 
except as fillets. A pan dressed fish, steamed or poached, is difficult 
to deal with on the plate even with chopsticks. The tiny bones all come 
loose and the fins fall apart - and the secondary body cavity is another 
problem.</p>

<p><b>Buying;</b> &nbsp; Buy the largest ones you can get. The larger they 
are the easier they are to deal with. I've used fish between 5-1/2 and 
9-3/4 inches weighing between 2-1/3 to 11-3/8 ounces.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are large and have fairly good 
adhesion so they take a bit of energy to scrape off and fly about quite 
a bit. They're very transparent so it's hard to see if you got them all, 
use a thumbnail to track down stragglers and pull them off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The head is wide, bony and difficult to deal 
with. The gills are hard to pull - you have to bend back the collar to 
get at them. I recommend just cutting it off and discarding it (it 
doesn't make very good stock). The innards are mushy but don't present 
much of a problem in the short body cavity - but then there's the 
subsidiary body cavity behind it. This appears to be a sort of lung 
allowing the fish to breath air. It is bony and turns an unattractive 
black when cooked, which is a major reason I recommend filleting.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a pretty easy fish to fillet with a 
coherent fin/bone structure. Outline the fillet top and bottom, then work 
down to the backbone from front to back, crossing over at the tail and 
working forward to the rib cage. Cut the ribs from the backbone with 
kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers.</p>
<p>There are some pretty nasty centerline spines for more than half the 
length of the fillet which need to be located and pulled straight forward. 
Then there's the subsidiary body cavity from the main cavity to the tail, 
Work your filleting knife under it and shave the whole cavity wall off the 
fillet, it's bony and turns black when cooked.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is thick and tough as leather, so it's 
very easy to remove by the standard <a href="seafishsr.html">
<b>Method</b></a>. It has almost no shrink at all so need not be removed 
for most uses, but it is a bit stronger in taste than the flesh. I 
usually remove it for poaching but leave it for pan frying.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; An 11-3/8 ounce fish yielded 4-7/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (43%) and 3-7/8 ounces skin-off (34%). A 2.3 ounce fish 
yielded 0.9 ounces of skin-on fillet (39%). You probably wouldn't want 
to skin fillets that small.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Bones and fins make a rather strong stock with 
quite a bit of oil. I don't really care for the taste so I do not 
recommend it.</p>

So what are you supposed to do with a tray of 300 or so 1 inch Climbing 
Perch? There were about 300 fish in this tray, all between 1 and 1-1/2 
inches long I haven't a clue what they do with these in Vietnam. Perhaps 
they are fermented into a fish sauce. What I did was dust them with a mix 
of rice flour and salt and deep fried them. Ate 'em "heads, guts and 
feathers" with a dip of lemon juice and salt. They were OK, but not 
something I'd seek out - not much flavor and a faintly bitter 
aftertaste. Anchovies and Smelts are better for this sort of thing.
