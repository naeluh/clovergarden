[Black kingfish, Black salmon, Ling, Lemonfish, Crabeater; 
Aruan Tasek, Haruan Tasek (Malay); <i>Rachycentron canadum</i>]
<p>
This excellent eating fish is native to the tropical and subtropical 
waters of the world, except the mid Pacific and east Pacific. In 
August 2015, thousands of young fish escaped from a cage on the 
Pacific coast of Ecuador. Within 6 months they were found along the 
coasts of Colombia and Panama. They are voracious predators, so are 
expected to significantly alter the ecology and fisheries along the 
Pacific coast as far north as Southern California. They are 
particularly fond of crabs, but also eat squid and fish.</p>
<p>This fish can grow to about 78 inches and weigh 172 pounds, but is 
usually around 43 inches long. The photo specimen was 24 inches long 
and weighed 4 pounds 1-3/4 ounces. It is the only species in the only 
genus of family <i>Rachycentridae</i>. There is no Cobia fishery, as 
it is solitary, just an incidental catch in other fisheries. It is, 
however, of great interest for aquaculture. Production is under way in 
China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Panama (2016), and being development in 
several other countries. IUCN Red List status NE (Not Evaluated).

Cobia is a highly desirable eating fish with good flavor and texture. 
Raw, its firm flesh is highly favored for sushi, and it can be cooked 
by just about any method, including grilling on skewers.</p>

<p>The flesh is moist with a flavor that's mild-medium and interesting. 
The dark region along the centerline has a slightly darker flavor and 
it's texture is noticeably gelatinous. Cooked, the flesh is still 
fairly firm, suitable for fish soups and stews. It tends to break up 
randomly as much as into distinct flakes. The belly flesh of larger 
fish is a bit fatty, so desirable for grilling and similar 
applications.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is becoming more available due to 
intensive farming development. It is a rather large fish, so you are 
most likely to encounter it cut into pieces, like the steak in the 
photo to the left. This steak was 5 inches across, 1 inch thick and 
weighed 14-1/8 ounces. It was purchased from a Philippine market in 
Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2016 US $9.99 / pound. They also had 
Cobia Collars (the bony girdle behind the the gill openings, including 
the pectoral fins) at $10.75 / pound, so there must be demand for it, 
as there is for Yellowtail Collar. The 4 pound whole fish specimen at 
the top of the page was purchased from the same market at 2016 US 
$4.99 / pound, an introductory price, as it's now about 2019 US 
$6.99 / pound at the same store.</p>

<p><b>IF</b> you are unfamiliar with preparing whole fish, see our 
page <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning & Filleting Round Fish
</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is mostly covered with tiny scales 
shaped like narrow elongated ovals. The white belly has no scales. The 
scales take some energy to scrape off, and they fly around a lot, but 
don't go far. The main problem is that they don't all scrape off, so 
I scale in two steps. First I scrape with the back of my prep knife, as 
for most fish, then I use the sharp edge to shave the fish, removing 
scales that tipped up and didn't come off. You can test for scales by 
petting the rinsed fish backwards, but watch out for the sharp spines 
in front of the dorsal fin.</p>

<P><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Nothing unusual here, except some parts are 
a bit tough due to the size of the fish. You'll need kitchen shears to 
sever the esophagus and to cut out the large gills. Be sure to break 
through the membrane covering the backbone so you can clean out the 
blood works there.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is reasonably easy to fillet, as it 
has a coherent fin and bone structure. Cut from top down and front to 
back, then over the backbone at the tail and work forward. When you 
get to the rib cage, just cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen 
shears. They pull easily from the fillet. This leaves the membrane lining 
the body cavity intact, but don't worry, it has almost no shrink and 
no noticeable taste. Pulling the centerline pin bones is more difficult 
- they are more needle size than pin size. They are in hard, and tend 
to break. Commercially, the centerline is just cut from the upper and 
lower fillets. This is a large fish, so it is usually parted out into 
8 or more fillets. The fatty belly of large fish is often sold 
separately for grilling, roasting or smoking.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has little shrink and does not have a 
strong or "off" flavor. It is thick and quickly becomes gelatinous. 
For hot dry cooking, like grilling, frying or broiling, the skin is best 
left on. For wet cooking, you must be sure the skin has been thoroughly 
descaled or it will have bad mouth feel. If so, it can be easily peeled 
off after cooking. Because it is thick and strong, the skin is easily 
removed from raw fillets by the usual long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Skinning is easier if you 
cut the fillets in half along the centerline so they are not so wide.
</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 4 pound 1-3/4 ounce fish yielded 2 pounds 
3/4 ounce skin-on (50%). Skin-off yield was 1 pound 13 ounces (44%). 
This drop is significant because the skin is thick, but it can go 
into the stock pot.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Heads, fins, bones and skins make a serviceable 
light-medium fish stock. For details see our recipe
