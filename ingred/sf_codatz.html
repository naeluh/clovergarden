[<i>Gadus morhua</i>]
<p>
This highly commercial North Atlantic fish can grow to 78 inches and 
over 200 pounds. Populations are found off North America from Cape Hatteras 
to northern Canada, off Europe from Northern France through the Barents Sea 
and off Greenland and Iceland. Commercial aquaculture has been established 
as wild catch is declining. Atlantic Cod populations have been over-fished 
and are rated "Vulnerable".  Efforts are underway in Norway to develop 
methods for farming this fish. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Bartlomiej

<p>CloveGarden is a Pacific coast site, so we use 
<a href="sf_codpacz.html"><b>Pacific Cod</b></a> here, 
but details of preparation and cooking should be quite similar.
