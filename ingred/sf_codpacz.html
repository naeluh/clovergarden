<h1>Pacific Cod</h1>

[Arctic Cod, Alaskan Cod, Gray Cod, <i>Gadus macrocephalus</i>]
<p>
This species has a distribution in the North Pacific similar to that of 
Atlantic Cod in the Atlantic. It is found as far south as the Yellow Sea 
and the coast of Southern California. This fish can grow to about 4 feet 
and 50 pounds but the photo specimen, from Canada, was 6.9 pounds and 25 
inches long.</p>
<p>This cod is not as threatened as the Atlantic cod, particularly since 
McDonalds has shifted to Alaskan Pollock (a cod relative) for their 
fish sticks. The Bering Sea and Aleutian Island fisheries have been 
certified by the Marine Stewardship Council as responsible and 
sustainable.</p>

<p>Cod is much preferred for consumer markets such as "fish and chips" 
because it holds together well in cooking but flakes apart easily on the 
plate - but most important is its bland flavor and lack of oiliness. This 
makes it suitable for restaurants where an inoffensive fish is desired.
</p>
<p>Some Pacific cod is salted and dried, but not so much as Atlantic cod 
where there is a large market for dried cod in Spain, Portugal, Italy 
and Brazil.
</p>

<p><b>Prep & Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with small very 
thin scales with medium adherence, and they do not fly around much when 
scraped off. The fish can contain a huge amount of innards (the bloated 
appearance of the photo specimen is <u>not</u> caused by a distended 
swim bladder). The innards are a little difficult to remove in spots 
simply because of the size of the fish. If you will be using the head 
you will need to cut the gill arches loose with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This is a fairly easy fish to fillet, not 
only because of its size but because there are plenty of bones to follow. 
When you get to the rib cage, just use kitchen shears to cut the ribs 
from the backbone - they are amazingly short and easily pull from the 
fillet without taking any flesh. There are, however, for the length of 
the ribcage, many centerline pin bones as large as the ribs. Pull these 
out forward with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has almost no shrink in cooking, but is 
usually removed because it's flavor is somewhat stronger than that of the 
flesh, and the whole point of cod is blandness. This fish skins fairly 
easily using the long slicing knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Before skinning cut 
away the skirt (belly). It is meaty and useful but needs to be skinned 
separately due to its width.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 6.9 pound cod yielded 2 pounds 14 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (41%). Skin-off it was about 2 pounds 8 ounces (36%) including the 
skirt.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Cod can be cooked by just about any method used 
to cook fish. It is quite delicate so needs due care, but that also means 
it flakes apart very easily on the plate. It is most often lightly battered 
and fried for "fish and chips".</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Cod heads, bones and fins make a serviceable fish 
stock, but it is not my favorite (see 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>). 
When simmering the stock foams without mercy and will overflow the pot. 
Perhaps adding a little oil will supress the foam (cod has almost no oil).
Remove any oil that does exist using your gravy separator.</p>
