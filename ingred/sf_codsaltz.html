<h1>Salt Cod</h1>

[Bacalao (Basque, Spanish); Baccala (Italian); Bacalhau (Portuguese)]
<p>
Salt Cod was once an important staple in southwestern Europe, particularly 
Spain, Portugal and Italy. Basque fishermen, who chased whales all the 
way to Iceland in Medieval times, discovered the North Atlantic cod 
fishery. They certainly "discovered" North America long before 
Columbus, but nobody knows exactly when. Basque fishermen were not 
literary people, and very secretive about their fishing grounds, and 
nobody can understand Basque (Euskera) anyway, not even most Basques 
today.</p>
<p>When Jacques Cartier "discovered" the St Lawrence River in 1535, he 
reported there were 1000 Basque fishing boats already there. The 
Basques invented the technique of salting cod, as it is done to this 
day, and soaking it to make it palatable. They called it "bacalao".  
The Norwegian Vikings had been freeze drying their cod, but that just 
wasn't practical for people from more temperate climes.</p>
<p>The photo specimen was 19-1/2 inches long, 7 inches wide and 1-1/2 
thick at its thickest point, weighing 2.3 pounds.</p>

<p>Today, salting fish to preserve it is not necessary. It can be 
frozen for storage and transportation, but the unique flavor and texture 
of salt cod has made it a prized ingredient, particularly in the cuisines 
of Spain, Portugal and Italy, as well as Canada and Brazil.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Salt Cod can be found easily in practically 
any one of the vast number of Italian grocery markets and delicatessens 
we have here in North America. Be prepared, however, for the price. 
The photo specimen, 2.3 pounds, was purchased from an Italian market in 
Los Angeles for 2013 US $11.99 per pound. For many people this relegates 
it to the realm of "special occasion" foods.

<p>Supermarkets used to stock Lasco brand salt cod in wooden boxes in 
the refrigerated displays. Today, I can find no evidence of it on the 
Internet. I've also bought salt cod at one of the local Korean markets, 
but they sell it skin-on, fins on and bones-in, making it much more 
difficult to work with.</p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3> &nbsp; Recently Goya brand Salt Pollock has become 
fairly common in refrigerated fish cases. Pollock is related to Cod, and 
salted Pollock tastes very similar. It is a smaller fish with thinner 
fillets which flake into smaller flakes, but at about 2019 US $5.95 / 
pound it is quite a bit more affordable, and more available.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Salt Cod should be tightly bagged and kept 
refrigerated. That way it can be stored for up to a year. Freezing it 
doesn't do a lot of good due to all the salt - it's never truly frozen 
and will eventually become rancid, just like ham and other salt cured 
meats.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; First you have to soak it in water long enough 
to leach out the salt - 2 to 2-1/2 days in the fridge, depending on 
thickness. Change the water twice a day. I put it in a heat sealed 
2-mil polyurethane bag and cut a corner off for each draining and 
refilling, then re-seal. Once it's soaked, just follow the recipe.

<p><b>A Faster Way:</b> &nbsp; This method works well for recipes where 
the Cod will be flaked apart.  
<ol>
<li>Soak in several changes of cool water for 5 or 6 hours at a cool 
  room temperatue. Drain.</li>
<li>Place in a pot with water to cover well and bring it to a boil 
  (uncovered to prevent it foaming over). Drain. Repeat two times and 
  check if it is still too salty. If it is, repeat again.</li>
<li>The fish is now fully cooked and can be used in salads, or added 
  to cooked dishes near the end of cooking.</li>
</ol>
