[family Gadidae (Cods and haddocks)]
<p>
Cod fisheries have been so economically important on both sides of the 
Atlantic, wars have been fought over them. There are many varieties of 
cod in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific, a number of which are 
economically important, but there are even more fish called "Cod" that 
aren't cod at all. &nbsp; <small>Photo of Atlantic cod by Hans-Petter Fjeld

<h2>Atlantic Cod</h2>
<br><a href="sf_codatz.html">
<img src="img/sf_codat01e.jpg" alt="Whole Atlantic Cod Fish 01e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Gadus morhua</i>]
<p>This highly commercial North Atlantic fish can grow to 78 inches and 
over 200 pounds. Populations are found off North America from Cape 
Hatteras to northern Canada, off Europe from Northern France through 
the Barents Sea and off Greenland and Iceland. Atlantic Cod 
populations have been over-fished and are rated "Vulnerable". Efforts 
are underway in Norway to develop methods for farming this fish.</p>
<p>Cod produces white, mild flavored, low fat flesh that holds together 
well when cooked but flakes easily. It's one of the three fish used for 
British Fish and Chips (the other two are 
<a href="sf_haddockz.html">Haddock</a> and 
<a href="sf_floundz.html">Plaice</a>. Cod is also smoked, dried 
(stockfish) and salted. Dried is particularly popular in the Basque 
country and Portugal. We don't have Atlantic Cod here on the Coast of 
California, but our Pacific Cod page will probably be pretty close for

<h2>Salt Cod</h2>

[Bacalao (Basque, Spanish); Baccala (Italian); Bacalhau (Portuguese)]
<p>
Salt Cod was once an important staple in Europe, particularly Spain, 
Portugal, and Italy. The fishery, off the coast of Newfoundland, 
was discovered by Basque whalers, and they invented the salting 
technique still used today (the Norwegian Vikings freeze dried their 
cod).</p>
<p>While fish can be transported and stored frozen today, the 
unique flavor of salt cod is still much favored in the cuisines of 
Spain, Portugal and Italy, as well as Canada and Brazil. The photo 
specimen was 19-1/2 inches long, 7 inches wide and 1-1/2 inches 
thick at it's thickest point, and weighed 2.3 pounds. It was 
purchased from an Italian market in Los Angeles, for 2012 US $ 11.99 
per pound. &nbsp;

<h2>Pacific Cod</h2>
<br><a href="sf_codpacz.html">
<img src="img/sf_codpac09e.jpg" alt="Whole Pacific Cod 09e" class=mrg></a>
[Arctic Cod, Alaskan Cod, Gray Cod; <i>Gadus macrocephalus</i>]
  <p>
This species has a distribution in the North Pacific similar to that of 
Atlantic Cod in the Atlantic. It is found as far south as the Yellow Sea and 
the coast of Southern California. This fish can grow to about 4 feet and 50 
pounds but the photo specimen, from Canada, was 6.9 pounds and 25 inches 
long.</p>
<p>This cod is not as threatened as the Atlantic cod, particularly since 
McDonalds has shifted to Alaskan Pollock (a cod relative) for their 
fish sticks. The Bering Sea and Aleutian Island fisheries have been 
certified by the Marine Stewardship Council as responsible and 
sustainable.

<h2>Haddock</h2>

<img src="img/sf_haddock02e.jpg" alt="Illustration of Haddock 01e" class=mrg></a>
[Offshore Hake, <i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i>]
<p>
This is a highly commercial North Atlantic fish closely related to cod, 
found from the Arctic Circle to as far south as New Jersey and the north 
coast of France. They can get as large as 39 inches and 37 pounds.</p>
<p>Haddock flesh is much like cod, white, firm, low fat and holds 
together well when cooked. It is much used for British Fish and Chips. 
Haddock are sold fresh, dried and smoked, but, unlike cod, they don't 
take salting well.

<h2>Hake / Whiting</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_hake03d.jpg" alt="Illustration of European Hake" class=mrg>
[various fish mostly in family <i>Merlucciidae</i> but some in family <i>Phycidae</i>]
<p>
This name is rather non-specific, but generally refers to 
smaller members of the order <i>Gadiforms</i> (cod, haddock, hake). 
In European recipes just "Hake" would mean European Hake (<i>Merluccius 
merluccius</i>) or <b>New England Whiting</b> (Silver Hake) but 
<b>Pacific Whiting</b> (Pacific Hake) would work fine too.</p>
<p>I recently purchased frozen fillets labeled "Hake, Wild Catch, 
China", but no fishbase listed Hake lives anywhere near China. Most 
listed hake are from closely along the Pacific or Atlantic coasts 
of the Americas and Europe, though some are from southern Australia / 
New Zealand. I'm pretty sure these fillets were actually 
<a href="sf_pollz.html">Pollock</a>. The illustration (copyright 
expired) is of European Hake (<i>Merluccius merluccius</i>), native 
to the Mediterranean, Black Sea and North Atlantic from Mauritania to 
the Norwegian Sea.</p>

   <br><img src="img/sf_whiting02e.jpg" alt="Live European Whiting 02e" class=mrg>
   [English Whiting, North Sea Whiting, <i>Merlangius merlangus</i>]
   <p>
    Native to the eastern North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, and through the 
   Mediterranean and Black Sea, this is the "whiting" called for 
   in European cookbooks. It was formerly considered a fish for the poor, 
   but due to general overfishing of European waters it is now valued more 
   highly. This fish can grow to 27 inches and over 6-1/2 pounds, but is 
   commonly caught at 9-1/2 inches. We do not have European Hake here 
   in Southern California, but this fish is of the same genus as the 
   Pacific Hake, so that page will probably serve for

   <br><img src="img/sf_hakea01e.jpg" alt="Illustration of Silver Hake 01e" class=mrg>
   [Silver Hake, New England Hake, <i>Merluccius bilinearis</i>]
   <p>
   This cod relative is native to the western North Atlantic from South 
   Carolina to a bit north of Newfoundland, Canada. This fish is highly 
   commercial, but most of the catch is exported to Europe where hake is 
   more in demand, particularly in Portugal. This fish can grow to 30 
   inches and over 5 pounds, but are more likely to be less than 15 
   inches. This fish is so similar to the Pacific Whiting we presume 
   you can use the same page for

   [North Pacific Hake; <i>Merluccius productus</i>]
   <p>
   This cod relative is native to the eastern North Pacific from southern 
   Mexico to southern Alaska, and is very similar to the Silver 
   Hake found on the Atlantic side. Pacific Hake doesn't keep well, so 
   it is usually processed immediately at sea. Most of the catch is 
   processed into surimi and similar products, as well as fish meal for 
   aquaculture. Some is sold dressed for human consumption: gutted, 
   headless and frozen. The fishery is highly regulated and this fish is 
   IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern). Pacific Hake can grow to 35 inches 
   and over 2-1/2 pounds, but the photo specimen was 15-1/2 inches 
   and weighed 13-3/4 ounces.

<h2>Pollock - Alaskan / Norway</h2>

<img src="img/sf_polloc05e.jpg" alt="Whole Alaska Pollock Fish" class=mrg></a>
[Walleye Pollock; <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> formerly <i>Theragra 
chalcogrammus</i>]
<p>
Native to the North Pacific through the Sea of Japan, around Alaska and 
down to Carmel, California, Alaska Pollock are the largest fish harvest 
in the world at 3 million tons per year. Most is made into sirimi 
(artificial crab meat) and McDonald's fish sticks. This fish can grow 
to 35 inches and 8-1/2 pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-1/4 inches 
and 1 pound 4 ounces. Alaska Pollock is considered a sustainable catch 
by marine ecologists, IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated). Norway Pollock 
is a very rare fish and considered near threatened. It is genetically 
the same as the Alaska Pollock but has a few minor differences in 
appearance.

<h2>Pollock - Atlantic</h2>

[Saithe, Coalfish, Coley (UK); Boston Blue; <i>Pollachius virens</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; European pollock; Lieu Jaune (France); Lythe (Scotland); 
<i>Pollachius pollachius</i>]
<p>
<i>P. virens</i> is native from North Carolina, north across the southern 
coast of Greenland, and along European coasts from northern Finland south 
to France. It is is a commercially important fish, but catch is only 1/7th 
of Pacific Pollock catch. <i>P. pollachius</i> has a similar range but 
no farther west than Iceland. Commercially it is bycatch, but it is 
highly regarded for sports fishing. Both species can grow to 43 inches 
and 46 pounds. The main use for both is fish sticks and similar products, 
though some smaller ones are dried. These fish are not considered 
threatened, and are IUCN Red List NE (<i>P. virens</i>) and LC 
(<i>P. pollachius</i>).
