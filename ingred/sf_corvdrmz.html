<p>This fish can be cooked by almost any common method. It is often pan 
fried as whole fish or fillets, but is also used in fish soups and stews. 
In the region, it is much favored for Ceviche, and can also be used for 
Sushi and Sashimi.<p>

<h3>Prep &amp; Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This Information is adapted from the 
closely related <a href="sf_weakkngz.html"><b>King Weakfish</b></a> and 
other Drums and Croakers, but should be generally valid for this fish.
<p></p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Whole or pan dressed fish can be fried skin-on 
with a few diagonal slashes cut into the flesh. Fillets can be pan fried 
skin-on or skin-off. The flesh holds together well enough to be used in 
soups and stews, if not overcooked.</p>

<p>Moderate sized fish can be baked or steamed whole or pan dressed. 
Skin shrink shouldn't be much of a problem because it relaxes fairly 
quickly, but I'd still cut a few diagonal slashes through the skin 
for baking.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; You are not likely to find this fish in fish 
markets except along the western coasts of South America.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with medium size scales 
that scrape off very easily with little flying around.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; No particular problems here, but the gills 
are quite hard to pull - you'll want to use your long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet, except 
there's nothing to guide you between the ends of the fin rays and just 
before the backbone. Be careful you come down on the right side of the 
bones. When you get to the ribcage, cut the ribs away from the backbone 
and pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers. They are long and 
very thin, but don't pose too much of a breakage problem.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; (from Weakfish) A 1 pound 1-1/2 ounce fish yielded 
8-1/2 ounces of skin-on fillets (49%). Skin off it was 7.48 ounces (43%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; (from Weakfish) Skin shrink is fairly severe but does 
relax. Pan frying fillets with the skin works well if you start with the skin 
side up. If you poach a skin-on fillet it will curl into a cylinder, then 
relax. By time it's done, you can place it flat on the plate. The skin of 
this fish is definitely stronger in flavor than the flesh. You can skin this 
fish by the usual long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a>, but the skin is quite weak and 
you'll probably end up with skin left on the skirt. This can be worked 
off with a razor sharp filleting knife.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; I have not tested this fish, but I didn't much like 
stock made from King Weakfish. If you do try it, It will have very little oil, 
but you should still remove what oil there is using your gravy separator.
