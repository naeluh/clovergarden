<p>
Native to the northwestern Pacific, particularly the Yellow and East 
China seas, this fish is highly prized among Asians in Los Angeles, 
especially the Koreans. In Korean markets they are sold frozen, dried, 
salted cooked and sometimes fresh, usually in lengths less than 12 
inches. They are often called "Corvina" (Spanish for croaker) or 
"Yellow Corvina" to avoid confusion with the other fish called 
<a href="sf_croakycz.html">Yellow Croaker</a>. This is the only 
fish allowed the name "Yellow Croaker" on Fishbase. They are easy 
to tell apart. This one has a round face, the other has a pointy face. 
The photo specimen, purchased from a Los Angeles market serving mostly 
Vietnamese and Chinese, was 13-1/4 inches long and weighed 1 pound 
2-1/2 ounces. This fish is caught wild and not considered threatened.</p>

This is a very good eating fish with a light, pleasant flavor. It's 
one drawback is the tenderness of its flesh and skin which makes handling 
in cooking and serving more difficult than for many other fish. For this 
reason many prefer small fish so each serving can be a whole fish. When 
eating whole or pan dressed fish, be prepared to deal with a few fine rib 
bones, and supply a bone bowl for the discards.</p>

<p>To the left is a box of 27 small Corvina as sold in the Asian markets. 
These fish are about 7 inches long and weigh about 2.3 ounces each. They are 
much less of a problem to eat than most small fish because the top fin pulls 
out easily and there are relatively few bones. These small fish can be cooked 
by any of the methods for larger fish, but I like them best dusted with 
salted rice flour and pan fried, or deep fried (no rice flour needed). For 
these small fish no cuts through the skin are needed for any of the cooking 
methods listed below. Six of these per person makes a decent meal.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The scales are medium size and scrape off quite 
easily with little flying about. Cleaning offers no particular problems and 
the gills pull out fairly easily. There are a lot of internal membranes but 
they pull out easily too. You will notice  thin layers of body fat on the 
inside walls of the belly. They will peel off easily but should be left in 
place for any method of cooking</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> (very small fish): &nbsp; The scales scrape off very 
easily with no flying about at all. Cleaning offers no particular problem 
except you will need to use your long nose pliers to pull out the gills 
and for some of the other innards because they're just too small to grasp. 
Of course these fish are used whole or pan dressed as filleting and 
skinning is just not practical with a 7 inch fish.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; Filleting must be done with care 
because the bones are short and not easy to follow and because the flesh 
is very tender and breaks apart easily. When you get to the rib cage, 
you will find it impossible to follow it with the knife. The ribs are very 
fine and there are few of them. Just cut them from the backbone with 
kitchen shears and deal with them in the fillet. Use your long nose 
pliers to pull them out, pulling sharply forward because they are raked 
back. There are only a couple of centerline spines worth dealing with.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Fillets are not easy to skin because the skin is 
thin and not strong, but it can be done with care. The skin shrinks 
moderately but not strongly when cooked. It does not have a strong or 
undesirable flavor. To skin, use the standard long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Yield</b> &nbsp; A 13 inch 1 pound 2-1/2 ounce fish yielded 9-5/8 
ounces of fillet skin-on (52%). Skinned that was 8-3/8 ounces (45%).</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish can be cooked by a number of methods, 
but each needs special care because of the tenderness of the flesh.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Pan Frying:</u> &nbsp; Fillets are easy to fry, skin-on or 
  skinless. They need a light dusting with rice flour so they hold 
  together well and don't stick to the pan. Start skin side up and turn 
  when cooked most of the way through. After turning, flatten them 
  against the skin curl. This is a thick fish so only rather small ones 
  should be pan fried whole or pan dressed.</li>
  <li><u>Baking:</u>  &nbsp; This fish is fine for baking and will look 
  good if you make several steeply slanted diagonal cuts through the 
  skin. You will find, however, you can't remove the flesh from the bones 
  and part it out like you can with some fish - the flesh is simply way 
  too tender and will break up. Best to serve a whole fish per person.
  </li>
  <li><u>Steaming:</u> &nbsp; Steaming considerations are similar to 
  baking. It is best to steam on a plate Chinese style rather than on a 
  rack.</li>
  <li><u>Poaching:</u> &nbsp; This is a fine tasting, tender, flaky fish 
  poached, but if done as fillets they must be skinned or they will curl 
  sharply, the flesh is simply not strong enough to fight the skin shrink. 
  Considerations for poaching whole will be similar to baking and 
  steaming.</li>
  <li><u>Deep Frying:</u> &nbsp; Chunks or whole small fish, this should 
  work fine.</li>
  <li><u>Grilling:</u> &nbsp; Forget it, the only way you can grill this 
  fish is wrapped in foil, and that's actually baking. Any other way and 
  it's just going to break up.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Stock:</b> Heads, fins, bones and skins make a serviceable 
light-medium fish stock with very little oil, but remove what there is 
with your gravy separator. See our recipe
