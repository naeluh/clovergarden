[<i>Nebris microps</i> alt <i>Plagioscion microps</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the West Atlantic, mostly off the north coast of 
South America from Columbia to Brazil, but a few can be found farther 
south off Brazil. It can grow to almost 16 inches and 1-1/4 pounds, but 
the photo specimen was 13 inches long and weighed 1 pound 1 oz. It is 
well though of as a food fish, and one of the highest priced fish in 
Trinidad. This fish is currently caught wild as a commercial catch and 
is not farmed. IUCN Red List status Not Evaluated.</p>

<p>This is a very good eating fish. The flesh is white with an excellent 
light but sophisticated flavor. Poached, it almost resembles lobster. 
Do not use a thick batter with this fish, just a powdering or rice 
flour or the like, and use a delicate sauce. You don't want to mask 
the flavor of the fish.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish can be cooked by just about any 
method normal for fish. Skin shrink is so low it probably wouldn't 
even need slashes through the skin for baking or steaming, whole or 
pan dressed. The flesh holds together well enough to use in soup if 
it is added near the end of cooking.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Though this fish is still not at all common 
in the Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles, the photo specimen was 
purchased from one at 2014 US $2.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with medium size scales 
that scrape off rather easily, with only moderate flying around.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; No particular problems here, but notice that 
the body cavity goes quite a bit farther back than the vent. The gills 
are a bit hard to pull - you'll want to use your long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet, except 
there's nothing to guide you between the ends of the fin rays and just 
before the backbone. Be careful you come down on the right side of the 
bones. When you get to the ribcage, well, there isn't any. The skirt 
on this fish is thick and meaty with no bones in it. There are a bunch 
of spines right between the main fillet and the skirt you'll need to 
feel out and pull. Some of them break rather easily.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 1 ounce fish yielded 9-1/2 ounces of 
skin-on fillets (56%). That's an excellent yield as this is a very meaty 
fish. Skin off it was 7.95 ounces (47%), but there is very little reason 
to remove the skin from this fish.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The has no strong or off flavor, and almost no 
shrink at all. You can even poach a skin-on fillet and it will barely 
bend, and then the skin will soften and the bend will disappear. If 
you want, you can remove the skin with the usual long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a>, but take care, it is not 
really strong.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Head fins and bones make a very fine mildly 
flavored stock. All it needs is a little salt to make it quite 
palatable. Skins can be included with little change in flavor. It will 
have almost no oil, but you should still remove what oil there is using 
your gravy separator. For details see our recipe
