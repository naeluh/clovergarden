[Kingfish, Pasadena Trout; Corvina bianca (Spanish); 
<i>Genyonemus lineatus</i>]
<p>
</p>
<p>This fish is native to the west coast of North America, most common 
off Southern California and fading out north of California and midway 
down Baja California. It can be told from most similar croakers by lack 
of a barbel under the lower lip. It can grow to 16 inches, but is 
commonly under 10 inches. The photo specimen was 7-3/4 inches and weighed 
2-7/8 ounces. This fish is IUCN Red Listed NT (Near Threatened) due to 
declining numbers of adult fish.</p>

<p>This is a good eating fish, except for the size. It's a bit too small 
to fillet, so best to pan dress it and pan fry or poach it in that state. 
I usually pan fry with a light dusting of rice flour to keep it from 
sticking. Use simple light sauce that won't mask the moderate flavor of 
the off-white flesh. I usually use my 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html"><b>Lemon Wine Sauce for 
fish</b></a>.</p>

<p>I always eat small fish like this with pointy chopsticks. This makes 
finding pin bones and the like easier, but some will still get through 
and have to be removed from the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish sometimes appears in the Philippine 
fish markets here in Los Angeles, close to it's center of the fish's 
population. It will not be found in most of North America due to its 
limited range and modest numbers.</p>

<p><b>Pan Dressing:</b> &nbsp; Forget your filleting knife, it isn't 
the right tool for this fish. You need a sharp pare of kitchen shears.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish. There will be only a few small scales down near the 
tail, and they scrape off very easily.</li>
<li>Cut off the head with kitchen shears, down behind both pectoral and 
  pelvic fins.</li>
<li>With the shears, cut the belly open back to the vent.</li>
<li>Scoop out all the innards. They are mushy, but with some membranes 
  that have to come out. The inside should be clean down to the 
  backbone.</li>
<li>Cut away the skirt, it is very thin so there is no susbstantial 
  loss of flesh.</li>
<li>If pan frying, dust lightly with rice flour to prevent sticking. 
  First fry on one side, then the other. The body cavity will now be 
  so wide,   you can finish it sitting right side up.</li>
<li>After cooking, pull the top and bottom fins out to make eating 
  easier. This is easy and can be done before serving or by the diner 
  on the plate. There will still be some thread fine ribs to deal with 
  on the plate, but the only way to avoid that is to sacrifice all the 
  flesh below the backbone for the first third of the fish.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is really too small to fillet, but 
I've done it for the measurements. It fillets fairly easily, if you 
are good at working delicately on small objects. When you get to the 
ribcage, you can probably just pull the fillet off the ribs, then remove 
any still in the fillet with long nose pliers. The ribs are long, thread 
thin, and slant sharply towards the tail.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 2-7/8 ounce fish yielded 1-1/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillets (39%). I made no attempt to skin the fillets. Pan 
dressed, your effective yield would be a little higher.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is severe and does not immediately 
relax. On the other hand, it doesn't have strong adhesion, so you can 
fry fillets skin-on if you cook most of the way through before turning 
skin side down. Pan dressed fish can be pan fried, deep fried or even 
poached without problems. The skin shrink will just stretch open the 
body cavity a bit.<p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Because this fish is almost always cooked 
pan dressed, there isn't much to make stock with except heads. I did 
not give that a try.</p>
