<h1>Croakers <small>&amp;</small> Drums - Corvina</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_drumred07g.jpg" alt="Whole Red Drum" class=mrg>
[family <i>Sciaenidae</i>]
<p>
Croakers and Drums get their name from sounds they make underwater. 
Corvina is a Spanish name for many fish in this family. Some of the salt 
water varieties are often calle Sea Bass.</p>

<h2>Freshwater Drum</h2>

[Gasper goo, Gaspergou, Sheepshead, Lake/River drum, Grunt, Croaker, 
<i>Aplodinotus grunniens</i>]
<p>
In the Asian markets of Southern California this fish has been 
most often labeled "Sheephead" but the Philippine markets are now more 
commonly calling it "Gasper goo".  This is a pretty big fish, the 
photo specimen at 21 inches and 3.85 pounds, but they can grow to 
over 3 feet and 50 pounds. Found in large non-freezing lakes and 
rivers in North and Central America, it is a minor commercial fish 
and not considered threatened.

<h2 id="croaky">Yellow Croaker</h2>
<br>This is confusing. There are two fish called Yellow Croaker in 
Southern California, often sold in the same market. Some authorities 
clearly assign them as <i>Larimichthys polyactis</i> and 
<i>Pseudosciaena manchurica</i> but Fishbase considers those two names 
to be for the same fish - the one we call "Corvina" here. Fishbase's 
photos are not clear, and there are a bunch of croakers looking quite 
similar - but based on tail shape and stripe patterns in Fishbase I 
settled on M. undulatus, confirmed by the Smithsonian Environmental 
Research Center. Their photo of M. undulatis is very good, and a dead 
ringer for my boy.<p></p>

   <p>
   Native to the northwest Pacific, particularly the Yellow Sea and East 
   China Sea, this fish is highly prized among Asians in Los Angeles, 
   especially the Koreans. In Korean markets they are sold 
   frozen, dried, salted cooked and sometimes fresh, usually in lengths less 
   than 12 inches. They are often called "Corvina" (Spanish for croaker) or 
   "Yellow Corvina" to avoid confusion with the other fish called 
   "yellow croaker" (see <a href="sf_croakz.html#croaky">Yellow Croaker</a> above). They 
   are easy to tell apart, this one has a round face, the other has a pointy 
   face. This fish can grow to about 18 inches, but the photo specimen, 
   purchased from a Los Angeles market serving mostly Vietnamese and 
   Chinese, was 13-1/4 inches long and weighed 1 pound 2-1/2 ounces, 
   IUCN status NE (Not Evaluated). &nbsp;

   It ranges from Massachusetts to Argentina and is considered a very good 
   eating fish. This fish can grow to 22 inches and 5 pounds 11 ounces, but

   fish is currently caught wild and not farmed. It is IUCN rated LC

<img src="img/sf_croakwt02e.jpg" alt="Whole White Croaker Fish" class=mrg></a>
[Kingfish, Pasadena Trout; Corvina bianca (Spanish); 
<i>Genyonemus lineatus</i>]
<p>
<p>This fish is native to the west coast of North America, most common 
off Southern California and fading out north of California and midway 
down Baja California. It can be told from most similar croakers by lack 
of a barbel under the lower lip. It can grow to 16 inches, but is 
commonly under 10 inches. The photo specimen was 7-3/4 inches and wighed 
2-7/8 ounces. This fish is IUCN Red Listed NT (Near Threatened).

<h2>Red Drum</h2>

<img src="img/sf_drumred07e.jpg" alt="Whole Red Drum Fish" class=mrg></a>
[Redfish, Channel Bass, Spottail Bass; <i>Sciaenops ocellatus</i>]
<p>Strangely, this drum is not always red, and the distinctive ringed 
spot at the tail may not be there on some fish either, or may appear 
on only one side. This West Atlantic fish is found from Massachusetts 
to northern Mexico and can grow to 61 inches and 99 pounds, but the 
photo specimen was 16-1/2 inches and 2 pounds. The photo specimen, 
farm raised in Taiwan, shows an extra black spot on the side. Red drum 
was badly depleted to supply restaurants during the "Blackened Redfish" 
craze of a few years back, but stocks have recovered and it is now 
farmed - IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

<h2>Black Drum</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_drumbk01e.jpg" alt="Whole Black Drum Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Pogonias cromis</i>]
<p>This largest of the Drums &amp; Croakers is found in the western 
Atlantic from Nova Scotia, Canada, south around Florida and the Gulf 
of Mexico on to Venezuela and southern Argentina. They are found mostly 
in brackish waters near shore.They can grow to 67 inches and 113 pounds, 
but are commonly around 20 inches. The distinct bars on young fish fade 
as they become larger. Young Black Drum have the same taste and cooking 
properties as the closely related Red Drum. It is suggested that fish 
over 15 pounds be returned to the water, as they are very difficult to 
scale and clean, and the flesh will be quite tough and will not flake. 
IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern). For smaller Black Drum, use the 
<a href="sf_drumrz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a> for the 
closely related Red Drum.

<p>
<p>This fish is native to the West Atlantic, mostly off the north coast

1 oz. It is well though of as a food fish, and one of the highest 
priced fish in Trinidad. This fish is currently caught wild as a  
commercial catch and is not farmed. IUCN Red List status Not 
Evaluated.

northern half of Argentina.  It can grow to nearly 18 inches, but

can tear loose and the fish then escapes. This fish is currently 
caught wild as a minor commercial fishery and is not farmed.
