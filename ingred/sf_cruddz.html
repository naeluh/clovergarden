<h1>Common Rudd</h1>

[<i>Scardinius erythrophthalmus</i>]
<p>
This fish, native to most European rives and estuaries, has been 
introduced in the United States, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, Tunisia, 
Morocco, and Madagascar. It can be a serious invasive pest where 
introduced. This fish can grow to over 20 inches and 4.6 pounds, but 
is commonly under 8 inches. In North America it is most  often found 
salted and dried in markets serving Russian, Ukrainian and Armenian 
communities. The photo specimens were 7-1/2 inches long and weighed 
about 0.9 ounces each. It is caught wild and farmed, Red List rated 
LC (Least Concern).</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is easily available, vacuum packaged in 
clear plastic, in the refrigerated section of any market serving a 
Russian, Ukranian or Armenian community - which means it is <u>very</u> 
common here in Los Angeles. It is completely interchangeable with the 
closely related Vobla (Common Roach). It is cheap in Russia, but not 
so much so around here. I have purchased it for 2017 US $9.99 / 
pound.<p></p>

<h3>Eating:</h3> &nbsp; These instructions and the photo to the left 
are from our Vobla / Common Roach page, a nearly identical fish. This 
dried fish is heavily salted, flat, thin, completely covered with large 
hard scales, full of bones and stiff as a board - so how do you eat this 
thing? Do you really want to eat this thing? No you don't - not until 
you've eaten one - they're kind of addictive - so here's how to acquire 
the addiction. Please note, this is not something you want to do when 
you are in a hurry, or have plans to go somewhere.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need beer. You cannot eat Vobla without beer - and plenty 
  of it - preferably Russian beer. Around here that is most commonly 
  Baltica. This bottled beer has the unique advantage of a ring pull cap, 
  like on a can. No other sauce or condiment is used, but Vobla goes well 
  with conversation.</li>
<li>Hold the fish firmly and Pull out all the fins.</li>
<li>Now, open the belly of the fish (it has been disemboweled, because it 
  is illegal to sell it otherwise, at least in "over regulated" 
  California - botulism risk). Pry it open and squish it down flat, 
  inside up. Yes, it's ugly as sin, but sin does have its attractions, 
  no?</li>
<li>Pull out the backbone. The thickest and easiest to recover flesh is 
  above the backbone.</li>
<li>Pull off small bits of flesh from the inside as you can find them, 
  picking off any tiny bones, as best you can.</li>
<li>Pop a little piece in your mouth and chew, along with a generous 
  swig of beer.</li>
<li>When no more flesh can be found, discard the debris - and send 
  someone out for more Vobla, and more beer.</li>
</ol>
