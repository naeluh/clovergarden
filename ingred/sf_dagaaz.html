[Dagaa (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya); Mukene (Uganda); Omena (Kenya); 
Silver Cyprinid, Lake Victoria Sardine; <i>Rastrineobola argentea</i>]
<p>
This is an important food fish caught in Lake Victoria and other lakes 
and rivers feeding into the Nile.  Dagaa is silver with a prominent 
lateral stripe and a lateral line that is very low on the body. It is the 
only fish native to Lake Victoria that survives in great numbers after 
introduction of Nile Perch and Nile Tilapia.</p>
<p>This fish can grow to just over 3 inches (8 cm) long, and is caught at 
night using lights, then sun dried. Dagaa is sold and distributed through 
the southern East African region for use as both human food and chicken 
feed. While it looks very much like <a href="sf_kapentaz.html">
<b>Kapenta</b></a>, they are Herrings, and Dagaa is a Carp. IUCN Red Listed LC 
(Least Concern).

<p>The largest catch of this fish is during the rainy season, but they 
do not dry well then (they are still just spread out on sand, old nets 
or rocks to dry. Salting and Smoking are not used). The rainy season 
catch, being of poor quality, is used mainly for chicken feed.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have not seen this fish for sale in North 
America in markets or on-line.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Like other carp, this fish is completely covered 
with large scales with fairly good adhesion.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> This fish is cooked in various ways, but these steps 
are fairly representative. They are adapted from <i>Recipe Book for 
Tanzania</i>, published in 1965 for use in Tanzania.
<ol>
<li>Dry pan fry the dried fish until it turns golden brown.</li>
<li>Rub between the palms of your hands to remove scales and sand.</li>
<li>Wash thoroughly. Boiling water may be used. Drain well.</li>
<li>Prepare a pan with Tomatoes, Onions, and Red Chili cut small. Cilantro  
  and Garlic may be included, and Salt to taste. Add Oil and fry until 
  soft.</li>
<li>Add Water, bring to a boil and add Dagaa. Simmer slowly until most 
  of the water is gone.</li>
<li>Serve with Rice, Ugali, Potatoes, or mashed Bananas.</li>
</ol>
