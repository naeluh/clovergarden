<p>[Philippine Dried Salted Fish]
</p><p>
   Tiny salted and dried fish are a very popular ingredient in 
   Philippine cooking. Many different fish are treated this way and are 
   called <i>Daing</i>. Dried Sardines are called <i>Tuyo</i>. They are 
   used both as an ingredient and as a flavoring, particularly with rice, 
   mung beans or other dishes that need a little flavor boost. 
   Interestingly, though the Philippine markets here in Los Angeles are 
   just loaded with these fish, more than a dozen varieties, none of my 
   Philippine cookbooks even mention their existence.</p>
   <p>The photo specimens, Salay-salay [Yellowtail Scad], were purchased 
   from a Philippine market in Los Angeles. The fish were about 5 inches 
   long and weighed 0.33 ounce each. For more on this fish see our 
   <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_scadytz.html"><b>Yellowtail Scad</b></a> page (other 
   scad are also used, and called Salay-salay).</p>

<p>A Philippine lady coming to the United States was afraid daing would 
be hard to find here, so she packed some in her suitcase. At U.S. Customs: 
Customs lady, "What's this?", Filipino lady, "That's daing". Customs 
lady, "Honey, this here is not dying, this here is <i>dead</i>!"</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Thin fish such Tuyo are usually either fried 
or grilled to be eaten as a crisp snack, served with seasoned vinegar 
or other dips. Filipino apartment dwellers here in North America often 
roast them in the oven to avoid offending non-Filipino neighbors. 
See <a href="sf_daingz.html#tuyo"><b>Tuyo</b></a> for details.
<p>Besides use as a snack, similarly toasted fish are often crumbled 
and used in rice or mung bean recipes, or any other dish that needs a 
bit of a flavor boost.</p>
<p>If the dried fish is a main recipe ingredient, usually simmered with a 
tomato sauce or similar, a meatier dried fish should be selected. 
Daing na Bisugo is an example. Because these fish are meatier, they are 
split and butterflied before drying.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Any decently stocked Philippine market will have 
at least a dozen varieties of tiny dried fish similar to those in the 
photos and some larger or smaller, whole or split and butterflied. Here 
in Southern California a Philippine market can be found near almost 
any large hospital complex, because our entire health care system runs 
on Philippine immigrants.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These should be kept refrigerated, but will 
keep for months. They can be frozen, but won't last much longer because 
temperature fluctuations bring rancidity with salted meats and fish.

[Threadfin Bream; Nemipterid; Bisugo (Philippine) family 
<i>Nemipteridae</i>]
<p>
This is a very popular variety of daing, especially for recipes that 
require a fish with a reasonable amount of flesh. For more on this 
family of fish see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_thrdfbz.html"><b>Threadfin Bream</b></a> page.

[Gray Mullet; Banak (Philippine); <i>Mugil cephalus</i>]
<p>
This fish is gaining acceptance in the Philippines and farming operations 
have been started. It is fleshy enough to require being butterflied for 
drying. This is a worldwide fish, for more information see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_mullfhz.html"><b>Gray Mullet</b></a> page.

[Genus <i>Sardinella</i> various species and  <i>Dussumieria acuta</i>]
<p>
Many kinds of small and medium herring are found in the Indo-Pacific 
region, and several are popular in the Philippines, used in various ways. 
The photo specimens were about 5 inches long and weighed about 0.3 ounces 
each. These fish have been eviscerated in keeping with California law 
(removes botulism risk) but are still labeled "To be cooked before 
eating". The Philippine fish naming tends to be rather imprecise, and 
"Tunsoy" covers a number of species. For more information on Herring, 
see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_herrz.html"><b>Herring</b></a> page.

<h2 id="tuyo">Tuyo</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sardda03f.jpg" alt="Dried Sardines" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Sardinella</i>]
<p>
Many small and tiny fish are salted and dried in the Philippines and 
are generally called <i>Daing</i>, but sardines are important enough 
to have their own name, <i>Tuyo</i>. It was once considered food for 
the poor, since it was inexpensive, but today it is appreciated by 
all social classes.</p>
<p> While it is now used in pasta dishes and other fancy recipes, it 
is still a popular breakfast dish. Fried almost crisp, it is 
accompanied by rice, often garlic fried rice, and a spiced vinegar 
dip. they can also be fried up as a snack at other times of the day, 
but always served with a spiced vinegar dip (usually spiced with 
chilis).</p>
<p>In North America, Filipinos living in apartment buildings find 
it necessary to bake the fish in the oven rather than fry it to 
avoid offending non-Filipino neighbors (apartment ovens are usually 
vented directly to the outside). This is done by preheating the oven 
to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C, sealing the fish in an aluminum foil pocket, 
and baking for 6 to 10 minutes.

[Beltfish; <i>Trichiurus lepturus</i>]
<p>
This fish can grow to 7 feet, but small ones are split, salted and 
dried for use the same as other small fish under the general heading 
of "daing". The photo specimen was 19-1/4 inches long and weighed 
1-1/2 ounces. It was purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles 
for 2016 US $2.99 for 3-5/8 ounces, or $13.20 / pound. For more on this 
fish see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_beltz.html"><b>Beltfish</b></a> page.
