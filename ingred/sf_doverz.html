<h1>Dover Sole / Slime Fish</h1>

[Slime Sole, Slippery Sole; <i>Microstomus pacificus</i>]
<p>
You do not want to buy this fish. This right eyed flounder is not 
anything like the Dover Sole or Common Sole 
(<a href="sf_solez.html"><i>Solea solea</i></a>) of Europe. This 
one's real name is "Slime Fish", and it's mainly processed into mink 
food. It is, however, also sometimes passed off to unsuspecting 
consumers as "Dover Sole", or even worse, under some other name. It 
is edible, though insipid, but used in recipes intended for real 
Dover Sole (Fishbase "Common Sole") it is an unmitigated disaster. 
It turns into slimy mush.</p>
<p>Slime Fish infests coastal regions from southern Japan all the 
way around to just south of San Diego, California. This fish can 
grow to about 30 inches long and 7.6 pounds, but the  photo specimen 
was 17-3/4 inches long and weighed 2 pounds 1 ounce.</p>
<p><i>Solea solea</i>, which is a true sole, not a flounder, is not 
found outside European and North African waters, so it tends to be 
rather expensive around here, if you can find it at all. When a recipe 
calls for "Dover Sole", <a href="sf_petrz.html">Petrale Sole</a> 
(actually a flounder) will do fine, but not <i>Pacificus</i>. Use 
caution, I have seen Dover Sole labeled as Petrale Sole (hint, Petrale 
is white on the blind side).

<p>Some may feel the notes below are exaggerated. If you think they are, 
go out and buy one of these fish for yourself and learn better - but 
keep in mind I warned you not to.</p>

<p><b>Identifying:</b> &nbsp; I have seen this fish sold under various 
false  names, even Petrale Sole, a far more worthy fish. Fortunately, 
this fish can be easily recognized. First, it's dark on both sides, the 
blind side being just a little lighter and more gray. Note that the 
lateral line is quite straight, arching up just a little over the 
pectoral fin. The eyes are very bulgy, and the mouth very small. 
On both the upper and lower jaw, the small, closely packed teeth 
are developed only on the blind side. there are often very small reddish 
spots scattered here and there on the eye side.</p>

<p>If you buy a whole fish, the first thing you will notice is that it 
is very slippery, very limp, and feels like a bag full of Jello. It gets 
worse from here. Aside from the jelly-like texture of the flesh, it has 
almost no detectable flavor. Fried in a light oil with just a dusting of 
rice flour, flour and oil will be the only flavors you will detect. But 
there are other problems before you get to taste it.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; You can use only quick, dry heat cooking 
methods such as pan frying, broiling or grilling (wrapped in foil). 
Most notes specify grilling on the bone for best flavor and edibility, 
but I'm pretty sure it needs to be wrapped in foil or you'll have only 
bones on the grill in short order.</p>
<p><b>Do Not</b> use this fish for recipes found in cookbooks or on the 
Internet - those are for real Dover Sole - this fish will just turn to 
mush - as many have found to their distress. The only way to save dinner 
then is a call to the pizza guy.</p>
<p>For pan frying, you will need at least a pretty good powdering of rice 
flour to keep fillets from sticking to the pan - and to hold them 
together - they will not hold together on their own.</p>
<p>Wet cooking is pretty much out of the question, but, as an experiment, 
I poached a couple of fillets. They shrank a lot, a whole lot, and were 
so small I was able to lift them out intact. Eating them was another 
matter, the fillets fell apart into tiny flakes at a touch.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_dovers03f.jpg" alt="Fillets" class=mrg>
<b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is most commonly found as fillets 
in supermarkets and fish counters - and, if you really want this fish, 
that's the way to buy it - or suffer the consequences. The photo 
specimen fillets were purchased frozen from Trader Joe's at 2011 US 
$4.99 / pound. To their credit, TJs recommends pan frying and provides 
cooking instructions only for quick dry heat methods. The largest of the 
fillets in the photo to the left was 9-3/4 inches long and very thin at 
2-3/8. ounces. These fillets are very tender and tend to be already 
breaking up in the package. They also exude a huge amount of water, so 
if you buy a pound, figure on cooking a lot less than that.</p>
<p>The whole fish in the photo at the top of the page was purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, California, but this fish is 
rarely seen even there. I have seen it sold as "Dover Sole" for 2014 US 
$2.49 / pound, and mislabeled as "Petrale Sole" for 2014 US $2.99 / pound - 
a rip-off even at the lower price. I had no choice, I needed fish for 
a photo and first hand analysis, but be warned.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with very tiny 
scales which are not easy to scrape off the usual way. You have to use 
the sharp edge of you prep knife to shave them off, and they scrape off 
as a stiff gray sludge. You can't see where they have been removed, so 
just keep on scraping until you don't get any more of the sludge, just 
slime.</p>
<p>As you scrape, the fish will be oozing an impressive torrent of 
slippery slime, until you literally can't hold on to the fish. It will 
slide all over the place and probably get away from you several times. 
You will have to wash the slime off your cutting board several times 
during scaling. I suppose you could simply clean out the guts, wrap the 
fish in foil, grill or broil it and try peeling the skin off after 
cooking, scales, slime and all. Not very appetizing, though.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The main problem cleaning this fish is that 
it's almost too slippery to hold and too limp to control. You can make a 
cut in the belly on the blind side just above the fin and behind the 
head to pull out the innards. A better method, if you don't need the head 
on, is to cut off the head. Use kitchen shears from the top through the 
backbone, and make a cut on each side behind the pectoral and pelvic fins 
(the little tiny ones under the head). Pull the head off straight forward 
and most of the guts will come out with it. The body cavity runs almost 
the full length of the fish, and is pretty ugly too, very messy. There's 
a long hunk of pink guts on both sides of the fin rays that won't pull 
out. If you're going to cook the fish "on the bone", best to use your 
kitchen shears and just cut off the bottom fin high enough so you can 
get them out. If you are filleting the fish, they will be exposed and 
you can just peel them off.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; Again, the main problem is the fish is too 
limp and slippery to control, and will continue to ooze slime - but 
Follow our method for <a href="sf_petrz.html">Petrale Sole</a>, 
filleting from the backbone out to the edges, as best you can. The 
backbone is at the top edge of the lateral line. Feel the limp slippery 
fillets for bones and fin rays, and just scrape off the ones you find. 
That's easy because the flesh is so soft.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin does not have a bitter, oily or "off" 
flavor, but has considerable shrink when it hits hot water or oil. The 
flesh has no dimensional integrity so the skin just curls it up into a 
roll. The only way to control this in a frying pan is to coat the fillets 
with a dusting of rice flour or similar, and fry it skin side up until 
the other side browns and stiffens the fillet. It'll still be pulled out 
of shape a lot when you turn it over, but won't curl up. Cooked, the skin 
is, as you might expect, thick and mushy - it is wet and does not brown 
easily. The skin can be removed by the usual cutting board and long knife 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but slipperiness is yet 
again a problem - and use care. If you break through the skin, try 
starting over from the front end.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 2 pound 1-5/8 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 1 
ounce of skin-on fillet (52%) and 10-1/2 ounces skin-off (31%). The yield 
goes down so much because the skin is fairly heavy, it's almost 
impossible to get it off cleanly, and you lose all the thinner flesh 
out by the fin margins. Smaller fish will yield a slightly smaller 
percentage.</p>

<p><b>Soup Stock:</b> &nbsp; Surely you jest. "Anyone for a nice bowl of 
slime soup?" No, I didn't try it - there are some things I'm just not 
fool enough to try - not many, but there are some.</p>
