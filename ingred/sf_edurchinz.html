<h1>Sea Urchins</h1>

[class <i>Echinoidea</i> many orders, genera and species]
<p>
Sea urchins are a favorite food of sea otters and California spiny 
lobsters. Their reproductive organs are eaten by people, sometimes 
lightly cooked in French sauces, but most commonly raw, mostly in Japan, 
Korea, Chile and California sushi bars.</p>
<p>Sea Urchins are harvested in California (where they are a popular 
sushi), New England (where they are NOT eaten, thank you very much), 
Chile, Japan and other places. They are shelled in the seafood factories 
and the edible organs are put up in rows in little wooden or plastic 
trays, ready to eat.</p>
<p>Here in Southern California Sea urchins are highly destructive to our 
economically important kelp beds, so it would be better if more people 
ate them. Perhaps they would be more popular if it were widely known that 
sea urchin reproductive organs contain cannabinoids and are considered 
aphrodisiac as well. In Japan these organs are called <i>Uni</i> and in 
Chile they are called <i>Erizo</i>, and <i>Ricci di mare</i> in Sicily. 
Go to your local sushi bar and order Uni, the lobsters and sea otters 
can't handle them all without your help (yes, I like uni and order it 
often). &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

The photo to the left is the form in which Uni is most often served in 
sushi bars: a lump of rice with toasted seaweed (nori) wrapped around and 
the uni plunked on top. It often embellished with a raw quail egg broken 
over it. Yum!</p>
<p>Sea urchin is served raw in Sicily and Chile, and used to flavor 
sauces in Italy and France.

<p><b>Funny Story:</b> &nbsp; This was published on the front page bottom 
center of the old Wall Street Journal, long before Murdock bought it and 
made it a Republican Party propaganda rag.</p>
<p>California's uni exports to Japan were doing well, but were not 
keeping up with demand (too much was being consumed domestically), so 
a fish factory in New England decided to get in on the business.</p>
<p> A Wall 
Street Journal reporter visited the operation and was shown around by 
the plant manager. At one point the manager picked up a tray of the 
product and asked the reporter if he'd like to try a sample. Being 
from California, the reporter said "Sure!", picked up a piece and 
popped it into his mouth.</p>
<p>One of the ladies on the shucking line stood up, pointed at him and 
shrieked in horror, "He's eating it!, He's eating it! Yeah, Down 
Easterners are still a bit provincial.</p>
