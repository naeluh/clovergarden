<h1>Cusk-eels</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_cusklb01g.jpg" alt="Shortbeard Cusk-Eel" class=mrg>
[Congrio (Chile); Family <i>Ophidiidae</i> of order <i>Ophidiiformes</i>]
<p>
Cusk-Eels, while somewhat eel shaped, are not true eels and belong to 
an entirely different order (<i>Ophidiiformes</i>). They never venture 
into fresh water, and can't be expected to be interchangeable with 
regular eels in recipes. The photo to the left is of Shortbeard Cusk-Eel 
(<i>Lepophidium brevibarbe</i>) which is a minor commercial catch found 
on the Atlantic coast from North Carolina south through the Gulf of 
Mexico, the Caribbean, and the north coast of South America to French 
Guina. There is a separate population off Uruguay and the southern tip 
of Brazil. It grows to about 10 inches.

<h2>Pink Cusk-Eel</h2>

[Congrio, Himakhara (Chile); Abadejo, Himakhara (Argentina); Kingclip, 
Ling, Pink Ling (Australia, New Zealand); <i>Genypterus blacodes</i>]
<p>
This commercially important fish is native to deep water off the 
coasts of South America from Chili around to Brazil. It is also 
found along the coasts of southeastern Australia and especially all 
around New Zealand. This fish can grow to 5-1/2 feet long and 55 
pounds, but they are more typically around 3 feet long. Cusk-Eel is 
prized for its firm light colored flesh, particularly in Chile. This 
is the fish used in the Chilean soup Caldillo de Congrio made famous 
by Pablo Neruda in his poetry.
IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated).

<p>This fish is not currently available in North America. Fishbase 
considers the coast of Baja California to be suitable habitat, but 
there are not yet any Pink Cusp-eels living there. As a substitute, 
use a fish with light colored flesh that stays firm with wet cooking. 
<a href="sf_emperpz.html"><b>Pink Ear Emperor</b></a> or 
<a href="sf_monkz.html"><b>Monkfish</b></a> should be excellent, 
but other fish can be also be used.

<h2>Kingklip</h2>

[Koningklip (Africans); Rosada del Cabo (Spanish); <i>Genypterus 
capensis</i>]
<p>
This commercially important fish is closely related to the Pink Cusk-Eel 
(and sometimes confused with it commercially), but native to the Atlantic 
coast of Namibia and around the southern tip of South Africa. One of the 
most popular fish in South African restaurants, it was seriously 
overfished during the 1980s, so some controls have been put in place and 
it is currently by-catch only. This fish can grow to nearly 6 feet long 
and 33 pounds. IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated).
