<p>[Rice Eel, Asian Swamp Eel; Luon Nguyen Con (Viet); <i>Monopterus 
albus</i>]
</p><p>
This eel is native to Southeast Asia, China, Japan, and possibly 
Bangladesh. A very similar but smaller eel, <i>M. cuchia</i> is 
found from Pakistan through Bangladesh and Burma. <i>M. albus</i> 
can grow to a little over 39 inches but the photo specimen, bought 
off the ice (previously frozen) at an Asian market in California, was 
32 inches and weighed 1.1 pound factory cleaned. This eel is in no way 
endangered and can be a pest. Feel free to eat as many as you'd like.
</p>
<p>Morons have released some in the Southeast U.S. and Hawaii so they 
are now found in Hawaii, Georgia and Florida, and are starting to 
invade the Mississippi river with resulting ecological damage. They 
are extremely durable, can live a long time without water (they tunnel 
deep during drought), can travel over land, and tolerate brackish 
water and freezing temperatures. They also reproduce much faster than 
freshwater eels because they don't bother with the trip out to sea for 
spawning (or the dying part either).</p>
<p>Swamp Eels are easy to tell from freshwater eels because they have 
tiny eyes way up near the tip of the nose, the tail tapers to a point, 
they have only one gill slot per side, under the head, and they have 
no fins (pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, anal or caudal) but at most a fold 
of skin back at the tail end.</p>

<p>This fish has become popular enough that it's being farm raised 
in Vietnam. The flesh of this fish is medium flavor and still very 
firm when wet cooked. It does not flake, but breaks up easily. It 
will work fine in soups and stews. In texture and flavor it reminds 
me somewhat of shark, though they are in no way whatever related.</p>

<p>I rather like this fish as poached fillets, served with my standard 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html"><b>Lemon Wine Sauce</b></a>. 
The flavor is good, and I like the contrast between the firm flesh 
and the gelatinous skin. Skin-on fillets don't curl much when added 
to the poaching liquid.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly common in the large 
Asian fish markets here in Southern California, either on ice, or 
frozen, curled up in a shrink wrapped foam tray. The photo specimen was 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel).</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; None. This fish makes no attempt to be 
Kosher.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; In my experience, they are always 
factory cleaned before shipping to North America. There's plenty inside 
them as the body cavity extends from the head to not far from the tip 
or the tail.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin on this eel shrinks like crazy when 
fried, but so does the membrane on the inside of body cavity. frying 
fillets skin-on or skin-off is going to result in some twisted fish. 
It does not curl much with wet cooking as the skin becomes gelatinous 
almost instantly.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; You would think a fish with a narrow body 
cavity over 2 feet long would be a real rib problem, but this fish 
doesn't actually have any ribs. It has a long backbone with short 
projections where ribs should be, but they go no farther.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the eel if it wasn't cleaned at the fish factory and chop into 
segments of the desired length. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife 
driven by a soft faced mallet is excellent for that purpose. If you'll 
want very short pieces cut to multiple length for easier handling and 
cut shorter later. The short tail part aft of the body cavity is rather 
difficult to deal with and has little meat on it.<p></p></li>

<li>Make a lengthwise cut along the fin line from the top down. There's 
no actual fin but there are short bones projecting upward from the 
backbone as with other fish. Your knife will be stopped when it reaches 
the horizontal bones.
<p></p></li>

<li>Now make another lengthwise cut folding the fillet away from the 
backbone and following the horizontal bones - don't go too far, just to 
their ends.<p></p></li>

<li>Flip the fish and and do the same as that previous cut but from the 
underside - again, not too far.<p></p></li>

<li>Finally fold the top and bottom of the fillet skin to skin and hold 
it together as you cut along the tips of the horizontal bones with kitchen 
shears. It should feel like you're cutting through cartilage. This will 
free the fillet from the backbone.<p></p></li>

<li>Now do the other side the same way and you'll have two fillets and a 
triangular backbone.<p></p></li>

<li>Some recipes call for skinning eel and some don't. The standard 
technique with American eels is to hang the eel by it's head before 
cleaning, cut the skin around the head and then pull it down and off 
the tail. On this eel the skin adheres really tightly, and it is 
usually already cleaned, but the standard cutting board and long knife 
method works fine.</li>
