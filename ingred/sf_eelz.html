<h1>Eel Families</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_eela03i.jpg" alt="American Eel" class=mrg>
[order <i>Anguilliformes</i> families <i>Anguillidae</i> (freshwater), 
  <i>Congridae</i> (saltwater), <i>Muraenidae</i> (Morays), others, and 
  order <i>Synbranchiformes</i> (Swamp Eels)]  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  See also <a href="sf_eelcuskz.html"><b>Cusk Eels</b></a>.
<p>
Anguilliforms is a large order of fish that have become very elongated 
to the point of resembling snakes and worms. While related to other modern 
ray-finned fish they tend to be rather primitive and a bit simplified. 
Freshwater eels spawn at sea and die there. Their offspring enter rivers 
as juveniles and live there until time to spawn. Lacking scales in most 
cases and scales that can be scraped off without tearing the skin in all 
cases, eels are not kosher.

<h2>American Eel</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_eela01e.jpg" alt="American Eel" class=mrg>
[<i>Anguilla rostrata</i>]
<p>
This freshwater eel is found in rivers and streams along the West 
Atlantic from Greenland to the tip of South America but is most common 
in the temperate zones of that range. Female eels can grow to 60 inches 
and 16 pounds but males only to 18 inches. North of the equator these 
eels go to the Saragaso Sea to spawn and die, a little to the west of 
where the European eels go. Aquaculture depends on capturing returning 
juveniles. There is a big market in Asia for these juveniles because 
of an eel shortfall there, but populations are declining and 
protections are being considered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
IUCN Red Listed EN (Endangered), do not catch or eat this eel.

<h2>European Eel</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_eele01e.jpg" alt="European Eel" class=mrg>
[<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>]
<p>This freshwater eel is found in rivers and streams along the 
East Atlantic from Morocco to northern Norway and in the Mediterranean, 
Baltic and Black seas. These eels can grow to 52 inches and 14 pounds 
but market  size is much smaller. These eels go to the Saragaso Sea to 
spawn and die, a little to the east of where the American eels go. Aquaculture 
depends on capturing returning juveniles but the runs have been scant 
recently and this eel is IUCN Red Listed CR "Critically Endangered". 
Do not catch or eat this eel.

<p>Baby eels (Elvers), still nearly transparent, have long been very 
popular in Spain. They are caught as they enter the rivers from their 
trip across the Atlantic, and are considered best fresh. In North America, 
they are only available canned, at 2019 US $10.22 per ounce. These eels 
are IUCN Red Listed CR "Critically Endangered". Do not catch or eat thse 
eels. Surimi baby eels are available from the same store at $1.24 per 
ounce, and are not endangered. They even have the grey stripe and eyes 
like the real ones.

<h2>Japanese Eel</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_eeljap01e.jpg" alt="Japanese Eel" class=mrg>      
[Unagi (sushi), <i>Anguilla japonica</i>]
<p>
This freshwater eel, native to Japan, China, and Southeast 
Asia including the Philippines, is caught wild and farmed. 
<i>A. japonica</i> spawns far out to sea and then dies, so 
aquaculture depends on capturing returning juveniles. They can grow 
to nearly 60 inches but are generally marketed much smaller. This 
fish is highly prized and expensive in Japan, and is not seen in 
California markets  - in fact most farmed eels in Japan are now 
American eels because the supply of Japanese eels is approaching 
"none". IUCN Red listed EN (Endangered), do not catch or eat this 
eel.</p>


<h2>Conger Eels</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_eelc02e.jpg" alt="Whole Conger Eel" class=mrg>
[Congrio 
(Spanish); <i>Conger conger</i> (European) &nbsp; | &nbsp; Anago 
(sushi); <i>Conger myriaster</i> (Japanese) &nbsp; | &nbsp; others 
of family <i>Congridae</i>]
<p>
This strictly ocean eel is much larger than the freshwater eels 
and much more robust in its reproduction habits. The European Conger 
can grow to nearly 10 feet and 350 pounds. They are found worldwide 
and there isn't a lot of difference from one species to another. They 
are farmed to some extent. The farms provide piles of long pipes for 
the eels to occupy with just their heads sticking out, often several 
eels per pipe.

<h2>Pike Conger</h2>

[Hamo (Japan); Daggertooth Pike Conger, Summer Eel; Ca Lat Cat Khuc 
(Viet); <i>Muraenesox cinereus</i>]
<p>
While this Indo-West Pacific eel can grow to 7 feet, it is commonly 
about 3 feet long. Though it is very expensive to prepare and bland  
in taste, hamo is very popular around Kyoto, Japan. In ancient times it 
was one of very few fish tough enough to survive a multi-day journey to 
the inland capital. It is shot full of bones and cannot be de-boned, so 
Kyoto sushi chefs use special techniques. The photo specimens, from 
Vietnam, were about 2 inches diameter by 2-1/2 inches high. This fish 
has no scales so is not kosher.

<h2>Swamp Eel</h2>
<br><a href="sf_eelsz.html">
<img src="img/sf_eels33g.jpg" alt="Whole Swamp Eel" class=mrg></a>
[Yellow Eel, Rice Eel, Asian Swamp Eel; <i>Monopterus albus</i> of family 
<i>Synbranchidae</i>]
<p>
This eel is native to Southeast Asia, China, Japan, and possibly 
Bangladesh. A very similar but smaller eel, <i>M. cuchia</i> is 
found from Pakistan through Bangladesh and Burma. <i>M. albus</i> 
can grow to a little over 39 inches but the photo specimen, bought 
off the ice (previously frozen) at an Asian market in California, was 
32 inches and weighed 1.1 pound factory cleaned. This eel is in no way 
endangered and can be a pest. Feel free to eat as many as you'd like.
