<h1>Fish Eggs &amp; Caviar</h1>

<p>
Fish eggs (roe) have been on the human menu for thousands of years, 
prepared and eaten in various ways. According to the United Nations, 
other international groups, and the U.S. Customs Service, the term 
"Caviar" can only be used for the roe of Sturgeons and Paddlefish. 
Despite this, in common usage, the eggs of other fish eggs that 
have been salted and aged as sturgeon caviar is, are often also 
called "caviar", clarified with the name of the fish the eggs came 
from.</p>
<p>Because the difficulty of obtaining the eggs, the careful handling 
required, and aging under tightly controlled conditions, any fish eggs 
prepared in the caviar manner will be expensive, but demand for 
sturgeon caviar by the ultra wealthy has taken the price to astronomical 
heights. It's sort of like Sharkfin Soup for the Chinese - a way to 
show off your absurd wealth at parties.</p>

<h2 id="sturg">Sturgeon Caviar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgeon06h.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Sturgeon Caviar" class=mrg>
"Caviar' is properly the salted and aged roe of mature sturgeons, or 
their close relative, the paddlefish. After being removed from the 
fish, it is carefully graded, lightly salted and aged for two to 
three months under tightly controlled conditions, then carefully 
packed for shipment and sale. This processing has a definite effect 
on the quality of the product.
<p>Originally, caviar was food for the poor. British soldiers in the 
Crimean War complained there was nothing to eat but biscuits and 
"salty fish jam", but caviar had already begun its ascent to glory 
during the reign of Catherine the Great of Russia</p>
<p>Europe originally imported its caviar from the North American 
Colonies, but severe over fishing ended that trade, and Europe turned 
to Russia and Iran. The Atlantic Sturgeon is IUCN rated NT (Near 
Threatened) and is extinct in parts of its range.</p>
<p>The largest caviar wholesaler, the French company of Petrossian, 
has declared the age of wild harvested caviar essentially over - 
victim of overfishing, pollution and habitat loss. From here on out it 
will be from farmed fish. California sturgeon farms produce between 
around 80% of all caviar harvested in North America, and it is 
increasingly shipped worldwide. Petrossian has declared California 
caviar to be be approaching the quality of the best Russian 
products.

<p>Here are the traditional top Russian wild harvested caviars. Today, 
wild is pretty much unavailable in the United States, but farmed 
versions are becoming plentiful, at a price.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beluga:</b> &nbsp; from Caspian <i>Huso huso</i> - the most 
  presigious caviar (see photo). It was selling for between 2016 US 
  $195 and $300 per ounce, but has been illegal to import into the 
  United States since 2005. The eggs are the largest of all sturgeon 
  eggs, and vary from nearly black to light gray, the lighter coming 
  from older fish and being the most desirable. It is served with 
  non-metallic mother of pearl caviar spoons to preserve flavor, and 
  is Usually served plain on toast or blinis, accompanied by Champaign. 
  CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) has 
  banned all trade in Caspian Beluga, except some from Iran, because 
  Iran is judged to have the only effective fishing regulations. Various 
  Beluga hybrids are now farmed in several countries, and can be imported 
  into the US. Beluga/Siberian caviar sells in the range of 2019 US #170 
  to $250.</li>
<li><b>Osetra:</b> &nbsp; from <i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i> - 
  the second most expensive grade. It is firmer than Beluga, and varies 
  from dark brown to golden, with the lighter versions considered best. 
  It is treated much as Beluga caviar is. This caviar originally came 
  from the Caspian Sea, but the leading producer now is fish farms in 
  Israel. Farmed Osetra sells in North America in the range of 2019 US 
  $64 to 160 / ounce.</li>
<li><b>Sevruga:</b> &nbsp; from <i>Acipenser stellatus</i> - the third 
  most expensive caviar and accounting for about half of traditional 
  caviar production because this fish matures faster than others. The 
  caviar is pearlescent gray and smaller than most sturgeon caviar. It 
  is farmed in Bulgaria, and possibly elsewhere, and sells for between 
  2016 US $75 and $150 / ounce, depending on grade and source.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Other Sturgeon Caviars are gaining market share due to scarcity and 
high price of the three listed above.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>California:</b> &nbsp; From Pacific White Sturgeon
     (<i>Acipenser transmontanus</i>), this caviar has won praise from 
     the experts as difficult to tell from Russian Osetra. It sells for 
     between 2019 US $55 and $175 / ounce depending on grade. 
     California fish farms produce more than 80% of North American 
     caviar.</li> 
  </ul>

<h2 class=lrg>Other "Caviars"</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="bowf">Bowfin</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cavbow01c.jpg" alt="Bowfin 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[Choupique (Cajun); <i>Amia Calva</i>]
<p>
This is a popular low cost "caviar" with a unique flavor. Unlike sturgeon 
caviar, it turns red if heated. Bowfin caviar sells on-line for around 
2016 US $7.75 per ounce, plus overnight shipping. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="capel">Capelin</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_capelbk02h.jpg" alt="Capelin 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[Masago (sushi bars); <i>Mallotus villosus</i>]
<p><img src="img/sf_capelin04f.jpg" alt="Whole Capelin &amp; Eggs" class=mrg>
This circumpolar arctic smelt produces roe used in various ways. In 
Japan the whole fish, laden with eggs, is lightly battered and fried. 
The roe is also used fresh as sushi bars in Japan and California, as 
<i>masago</i>. The Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles sell whole 
egg filled Capelin when it is in season
<p>In sushi bars, the capelin eggs (masago) are usually dyed bright 
red-orange.They are served on a dollop of sushi rice with a wrap of nori 
seaweed around it to hold the eggs in place. For other markets they are 
dyed black to resemble sturgeon caviar. The individual eggs are about 
0.050 inch diameter (1.3 mm) The black specimen (pasteurized) was 
purchased on-line at 2016 US $4.40 per ounce.  For more on this fish 
see <a href="sf_capelz.html"><b>Capelin</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Flying Fish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cavff02h.jpg" alt="Flying Fish 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[Tobiko (Japan), family [<i>Exocoetidae</i>]
<p>
This fish roe is very popular in Japan for use as sushi topping and 
garnishes for various small dishes. It is dyed orange, red, black, yellow 
and green. Sometimes it is substituted with Masago (capelin roe) but 
experienced sushi enthusiasts will notice the smaller size. Flying Fish 
roe is about 0.08 inches (2.0 mm).</p>
<p> The photo specimen was purchased at a large Asian market in Los 
Angeles (Alhambra), 3.6 ounces for 2019 US $7.99 ($2.22 / ounce). While 
a product of Iceland, it was clearly made for the Japanese market, 
including Japanese ingredients, and labeled "Tobiko". Ing: Flying fish 
roe, salt, mirin, sugar, xanthan gum, citric acid, bonito extract, 
soy sauce, rice vinegar, sodium sorbate, natural yellow #6.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="lump">Lumpfish</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_cavlump02h.jpg" alt="Red and Black Lumpfish 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[Lumpsucker; <i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>]
<p>This is a popular low cost "caviar" from a very strange arctic and 
subarctic fish. The individual eggs are about 0.085 inch diameter 
(2.2 mm), firm, and stay very separate. They have a faint bitter 
aftertaste, but not enough to be at all disturbing. The specimens 
(pasteurized) were purchased on-line at 2016 US $2.29 per ounce 
processed and packed in Iceland where lumpfish are common.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="padl">Paddlefish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cavpad01c.jpg" alt="Paddlefish 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[<i>Polyodon spathula</i>]
<p>
This fish is related to the sturgeon, and produces Caviar that is quite 
similar, and is allowed by U.S. regulations to be labeled as Caviar. It 
is a bit smaller than Sturgeon caviar, smoother in texture, and the eggs 
have a bit less "pop". Color varies from steel gray to brownish gray. 
Given the high price of sturgeon caviar, there is considerable interest 
in farming this fish, both for meat and eggs, but also "ranching" them 
(stocking reservoirs where they feed themselves). Paddlefish caviar 
sells on-line for around 2016 US $24 per ounce, plus overnight shipping.

<b>Paddlefish</b></a>. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="salm">Salmon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cavsalm04h.jpg" alt="Red Salmon 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Oncorhynchus</i> (Pacific) and Genus <i>Salmo</i> (Atlantic) 
species]
<p>
Compared to other "caviars", these eggs are very large, and are milder 
and less salty. Flavor is good, the price is low (relatively), and these 
eggs are quite popular. The individual eggs are about 0.25 inch diameter 
(6.4 mm). The specimens were purchased bulk from the deli of a 
multi-ethinic market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $2.19 per ounce. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="white">Whitefish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cavwht02h.jpg" alt="Golden Whitefish 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
[<i>Coregonus lavaretus</i> (Europe) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Coregonus 
clupeaformis</i> &nbsp; (Probably actually the same species)]
<p>
This is a relatively mild "caviar", similar in taste to Salmon "caviar", 
which stands to reason since they are related fish, though the Whitefish 
is smaller and produces much smaller eggs.The individual eggs are about 
0.085 inch diameter (2.2 mm). The specimens (pasteurized) were purchased 
on-line at 2016 US $5.10 per ounce - processed and packed in Iceland.
