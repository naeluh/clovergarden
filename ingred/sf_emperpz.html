<h1>Pink Ear Emperor</h1>

[<i>Lethrinus lentjan</i>]
<p>
This Indo - West Pacific fish is found from the eastern coast of Africa 
through the South Pacific islands, and as far north as Taiwan. The most 
commercial of the Emperors, this fish can grow to 20 inches, but the photo 
specimen was 16 inches long and weighed 1 pound 15-1/4 ounces. This fish 
tends to olive on the upper body and lighter below, but adopts various 
other color schemes and patterns. "Pink Ear" comes from the variable size 
slash of red at the back edge of the gill cover. This fish is IUCN Red 
List rated NE (Not Evaluated), and is not considered threatened.</p>

<p>Pink Ear Emperor has a mild but distinctive flavor I find quite 
likable. <b>Important:</b> this fish can not be casually substituted 
for other fish in most recipes, save perhaps for 
<a href="sf_monkz.html">Monkfish</a>. It cooks up <u>very firm</u>, 
almost chewy, and is difficult to flake apart on the plate. I have 
steamed a whole fish (head off) and it was certainly edible, but a 
little tough to break up. Reserve this fish for recipes that require 
firm fish that doesn't break up with wet cooking, such as soups and 
stews.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish appears now and then in the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, but is often mislabeled. The photo specimen 
was sold as "Emperor Snapper" (it is not a snapper) at 2016 US $2.99 / 
pound at a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). The previous 
ones I bought were sold as "Silver Porgy", which it is not.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with stiff 
medium size scales with fairly good adhesion. They take a little energy 
to scrape off and fly around a lot.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp; The innards are clean and orderly compared to 
some fish, but take a little effort to clean out well. The esophagus is 
tough and must be cut with shears, and there are a number of strong 
membranes that need pulling. Your long nose pliers can help here. The 
gills pull fairly hard, and there's some junk in the throat that doesn't 
come out until the gills are pulled. Since I don't generally use the 
head of this fish, I just cut it off and discard it, which makes 
cleaning much easier.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a pretty easy to fillet fish with a 
coherent fin-bone structure, except at the rib cage. The ribs pull hard 
and tear up the flesh, so I recommend just shaving the fillet off the 
ribs, rather than cutting them loose. This is also a bit of a problem 
because the ribs project out horizontally from under the backbone for 
1/4 to 3/8 inch before they turn down. This makes shaving the fillet 
off a bit more difficult than usual. There are nasty centerline pinbones 
to pull for a little more than the length of the body cavity, and they 
tear the flesh also.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is moderate, and the skin has no 
strong or off flavor. Skin-on fillets can be pan fried fine. When you 
turn them skin-side down, just hold them flat with your turner. In a 
few seconds the skin will soften and the fillet will remain flat. I 
have poached skin-on half fillets. They curl fairly severely, but in 
a minute or two the skin relaxes and the return almost to flat. Set 
a poached fillet on a plate, skin side down, and it will be flat. If 
desired, fillets can be skinned using the usual long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is moderate, with two fish weighing a 
total of 3 pounds 11 ounces yielding 28 ounces of skin-on fillet 
(47%). Skin-off would be 24.9 ounces (42%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The heads, fins and bones, simmered or 40 
minutes, make a slightly murky stock with a distinctive flavor I don't 
care that much for - not recommended.</p>
