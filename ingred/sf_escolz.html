   This fish is found on tropical and subtropical continental shelves 
   worldwide.  It can grow to 78 inches and 99 pounds, but is commonly 
   around 59 inches. This often mislabeled fish is outstandingly 
   delicious, but is also a "problem fish"

<p><img src="img/sf_escola02h.jpg" alt="Escolar Cross Section Steak" class=mrg>
This fish is rather large, so it is usually sold as cross section 
steaks. The photo specimen, a medium size steak, was 3/4 inch thick, 
3-3/4 inches wide, 7 inches high, and weighed 9 ounces - wild caught 
from Taiwan.</p>

<p>This is an exceptionally delicious fish, a fish so good people rave 
about it, which causes many people to order seconds. This is a very bad 
idea (see <a href="sf_escolz.html#health">Health and Nutrition</a>). The flesh is soft 
and mild, but with enough flavor to be interesting, and with a rich and 
pleasant mouth feel. It can be successfully cooked by any method, from 
grilling to poaching. Escolar has long been a highly desirable sushi 
fish, but sale or posession of this fish is now illegal in Japan, to 
the distress of many sushi connoisseurs.</p> 

<p>All its positives have resulted in fraudsters selling it as more 
expensive fish, especially the extremely expensive Chilean Sea Bass 
(which is actually Patagonian Toothfish, but how can you demand a high 
price for a fish with a name like that?).</p>

<p>A 2009 study found that 55% of sushi bars in New York were 
substituting Escolar for "White Tuna", "Albacore Tuna", or calling it 
"Super White Tuna".  A 2010 to 2013 study showed that 84% of "White 
Tuna" served was actually Escolar. The FDA hasn't cracked down on 
this because they classify it as a tuna, and it is white.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I purchased frozen Escolar steaks from a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles for 2016 US $6.66 per pound in 1.5 pound 
bags, though I already knew the consequences - and there was an FDA 
warning poster right above the bags of frozen fish. One of the steaks 
had a distinctly orange tint, which I took as a warning.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with very tiny scales 
which are not easy to scrape off. Most commercial Escolar steaks are 
sold skin-on with scales, making the skin inedible.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin of this fish has very little shrink. 
The flavor is stronger than the flesh, but not disturbingly so, but 
it should be removed, as commercial samples I've tried have not 
been scaled. It is tough, and can be easily removed by the standard 
long knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. 
Some recommend skinning deeply, supposedly removeng oils near the 
surface, but this has proven innefective. The skin can be peeled off 
after cooking, but for wet cooking, it will soften and break up easily 
making this more difficult.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="health">Health and Nutrition</h2>

<p>The problem with this fish, and the very similar Oilfish, is that 
the "oils" providing mouth feel and flavor are actually indigestible 
wax esters, which can comprise up to 20% of the flesh. Eat a bunch 
of Escolar and you will know how the Exxon Valdez felt. Wherever you 
sit, you will leave an orange oil slick.</p>

<p>A few people suffer gastro-intestinal distress and diarrhea, but 
in most cases you just get the oil seep. This leakage is completely 
uncontrollable, you can't feel it happening, you can't stop it, and 
often it has little odor. It's called "Keriorrhea", Greek for "flow 
of wax". This can be <u>extremely distressing</u> for people who 
ate mislabeled fish, as the flow may kick in while at work or in 
public, and they often won't know about it until someone points it 
out.<p>

<p> The FDA has determined that this fish is not actually toxic, so 
has not banned it, but has posted guidelines for its consumption. 
They recommend keeping consumption to less than 6 ounces (some 
restaurants limit it to 4 ounces). Various suggestions for reducing 
the problem have proven ineffective. For a serving of sushi, I 
wouldn't worry about it, but this is definitely not a fish you want 
for a main dish.</p>

<p>Because Science! I ate an 8 ounce serving for dinner, just two ounces 
above the FDA maximum, on an empty stomach. I suffered no gastric 
distress, however, by morning the orange oil slick was well in evidence. 
Because of the limited quantity of fish, and empty stomach, I was able 
to quickly flush it through. Some people report the discharge lasting 
for many hours.</p>

<p><b>Scombroid Poisoning</b> &nbsp; Escolar is a member of the suborder 
<i>Scombroidei</i>, along with Mackerel and Tuna. These fish all require 
careful handling and refrigeration after catching, to prevent bacterial 
histamine production. Histamine poisoning is quite uncomfortable, but 
generally survivable, though it can be very serious for persons with 
histamine allergies, such as bee sting allergy. Immediate antihistamine 
treatment is called for in such cases.</p>
