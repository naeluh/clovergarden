Native to the Mekong Basin, this important food fish is thin, with flesh so 
tender it's almost mushy, and so shot full of bones, spines and fin rays it's

fish cakes, fish balls, and some kinds of pickled fish and fish sauce in 
Thailand and Vietnam. This fish grows up to 39 inches and 11 pounds but the 
photo specimen was 17-1/2 inches long and weighed 1 pound 6-1/8 ounces.
