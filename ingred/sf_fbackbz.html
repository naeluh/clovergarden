This Featherback is native to practically all river basins from the Indus 
through Southeast Asia, Sumatra, and Java, and occasionally enters brackish 
waters. It is absent from Borneo and the Red River of North Vietnam. This 
fish is very dark in color when young, and becomes lighter as it matures. 
It can grow to 24 inches (60 cm) but is more commonly 10 inches (25 cm) and 
is an important food fish throughout its range. It is fished commercially 
and also farmed. IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is cooked many different ways through its 
range. In Burma it is made with rice into a fermented fish cake, which can be 
cut up and used in salads, etc. It is also made into an unfermented paste for 
making fish patties, fish balls and the like. This would be done similarly to 
how <a href="sf_fbackz.html"><b>Clown Featherback</b></a> is processed.

nam phrik pla salat pon, a dip used with raw vegetables and in other ways.
