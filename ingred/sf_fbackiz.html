<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Assam, West Bengal, and Bangladesh, this fish is 
cut into steaks and cooked in curries (Chital maasor jul, Chital machher jhol). 
Prep for that use is given here. Some admit eating these is a bit tricky, due 
to all the bones, fin rays, and pin bones. This fish is also made into patties 
and fish balls just as the essentially identical Clown Featherback is used in 
Southeast Asia. For that usage, see instructions for 
<a href="sf_fbackz.html"><b>Clown Featherback</b></a>.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The large Asian markets in Los Angeles (Alhambra 
and San Gabriel, California) have Featherbacks up to about 19 inches in the 
frozen cases, and sometimes larger ones on ice. These will be Clown 
Featherbacks, but there is no significant difference except the spots. They 
were, until quite recently, considered to be the same species.<p></p>

<h3>Scaling:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is covered with zillions of tiny scales 
that take a bit of energy to scrape off.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; There isn't a lot inside these fish and what 
there is is hard to get at in the normal way, Just cut the head off behind 
the gills and pectoral fins. Then you'll be able to get at what's left in 
there.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This isn't practical. For curry, just slice this 
fish into steaks about 1 inch thick. Don't cut off the bottom fin - that'll 
just make fin rays more difficult to deal with. I have seen a video from 
India of a very large featherback being cut into chunks, about 2 x 3 x 1 
inch in size, skin-on and bones-in.<p></p>

<h3>Paste:</h3> &nbsp; If you want to make paste for fish patties or fish 
balls, see instructions for <a href="sf_fbackz.html"><b>Clown 
Featherback</b></a>.
