[[Clown featherback, Clown knifefish; Pla Grai (Thai); Ca Thac Lac 
(Viet); <i>Chitala ornata</i> (Mekong). &nbsp; | &nbsp; also

<p>
Native to the Mekong Basin, this important food fish is thin, with 
flesh so tender it's nearly mushy, and so shot full of bones, spines and 
fin rays it's nearly impossible to eat whole or as fillets. It is, 
however, the preferred fish for fish cakes, fish balls and some kinds of 
pickled fish and fish sauce in Thailand and Vietnam. In North America 
they are a popular aquarium fish. This fish grows up to 39 inches and 
11 pounds but the photo specimen was 17-1/2 inches long and weighed 
1 pound 6-1/8 ounces.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The large Asian markets in Los Angeles (Alhambra 
and San Gabriel) have Featherbacks up to about 19 inches in the frozen 
cases, and sometimes larger ones on ice. This fish is difficult and 
tedious to prepare, as noted below, but it's essential for some very 
popular fish cake recipes, the elastic texture of its flesh is truly 
unique.<p></p>

<p>I highly recommend dealing with this fish the way the local 
Vietnamese and Thais do. Dig around in the freezer cases until you find 
frozen blocks or small tubs of pre-scraped featherback flesh, then go 
directly to your recipe. The block in the photo was purchased from a 
large Asian market in San Gabriel, 14 ounces for 2018 US $4.69 
(5.36 / pound). For the small tubs, read the label, they may contain 
pastes from other fish.</p>

<h3>Scaling:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is covered with zillions of tiny scales 
that take a bit of energy to scrape off. Since you'll be discarding the 
skin you might just scrape them off the top and bottom so you can make 
filleting cuts and forget the rest.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Don't bother - there isn't a lot inside these 
fish and what there is is hard to get at, Just cut the head off behind 
the gills and pectoral fins and go on to filleting.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; Well, you can't, really, the flesh doesn't 
hold together well enough. I understand freshly caught fish have somewhat 
firmer flesh, but you can't get those around here. Just do the best you 
can, you've got to fillet it because the skin is too tough to get at the 
flesh any other way.<p></p>

<h3>Scraping:</h3> &nbsp; Using the back side of your prep knife, scrape 
all the flesh off both the bones and the skin. Note that it's shot full 
of pin bones in some areas. Try to leave all bones and fin rays behind. 
When I'm finished scraping I run the flesh through a food mill to 
remove anything I missed. Discard everything but the scraped flesh.
<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Two fish totaling 2.8 pounds yielded exactly 1 
pound of clear flesh for a yield of 36%.<p></p>
