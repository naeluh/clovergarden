Other genera and species]
<p>
Filefish are mostly tropical reef and seaweed bed fish, but some live 
in temperate zones. They range worldwide, but the largest populations 
are around Australia, where they are considered pests. They are mainly 
fished in East and Southeast Asia. Filefish have a strong spine at the 
top of their head, which can be folded back (as shown in the photo) 
or extended straight up. They have a skin covered in rough, 
non-overlapping scales. Filefish skins have been used as sandpaper 
in woodworking.  Some Filefish eat only algae, but others eat small 
invertebrates, jellyfish, coral polyps and similar. Filefish are 
not kosher - as for halal, scholarly opinion varies in the extreme.
</p>

<p>The photo specimen (<i>Stephanolepis cirrhifer</i>) is one of the 
best known species, ranging from southern Japan, along western Taiwan 
to the East China Sea. It can grow to 12 inches long, and is a highly 
commercial catch, but IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern). Vast numbers 
are now bred in hatcheries to increase the population, particularly 
for the large Korean market.

<p>Filefish is always skinned and filleted. I have seen a photo of a 
filefish being skinned, showing the skin cut across the top and cut 
or torn behind the head, then simply pulled off from the top down. 
The keel under the body cavity is then pulled down to remove the 
innards. The fillets can then be cut the usual way, but are very 
thin.</p>

Most filefish fillets are seasoned and dried for use as a snack. Dried 
fillets are very popular in Korea and Southeast Asia. The photo specimen 
was labeled as from Thailand, but the label was in a Korean style - not 
surprising as Thailand and Vietnam export dried filefish to Korea, where 
the demand is very high. Ing: filefish, salt, sugar. These dried fillets 
were typically 4-3/4 x 3-1/4 inches and 0.08 inch thick.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Dried fillets are held over a gas flame or 
similarly toasted until well heated and softened. They are then cut into 
strips and eaten as a warm snack. Kitchen shears work best for cutting 
up these fillets. The dried fish smell disappears, and they are quite 
tasty, if you don't mind them being a little chewy.

</p><p>
Fillets may be used 
fresh for sushi and sashimi, in Japan. Filefish nigiri sushi is a slice 
of the fish over a lump of sushi rice, usually topped with a piece of 
its liver and some grated daikon. The fillet is also used without rice 
for fancy sashimi plates.
</p>
<p>In Korea, raw filefish is prepared in a manner called Jwichi hoe 
(photo to the left), but I have not been able to find anything on the 
exact manner of preparation.
