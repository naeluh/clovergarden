[Bartail Flathead, <i>Platycephalus indicus</i>]
<p>
Flatheads are a fairly large family of fish but only this one is 
commercially significant. The Bartail Flathead can grow to 39 inches and 
7.7 pounds, but the photo specimen was 14-1/2 inches and weighed 11 
ounces, the largest from a package of three frozen in China. This fish is 
found from the Atlantic coast of southern Africa around through the 
Indian Ocean all the way to the mid Pacific islands, and has been 
introduced into the eastern Mediterranean. It ranges from from southern 
Australia north to Korea and Japan and is now also being farmed, 
particularly in Japan.</p>

<p>This is an excellent eating fish with a flavor and texture similar to 
cod. Unfortunately it isn't much exported to the U.S. yet so tends to be 
a bit expensive.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Flathead is completely covered with tiny scales 
that scrape off fairly easily without a lot of flying about. Gills are 
hard to remove but, since my 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html">filleting method</a> doesn't need the head 
I just cut it off - then the gills are easy to deal with.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This isn't difficult but when you get to the 
rib cage the ribs are hard to follow with a knife so just cut them from 
the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them off the fillet with long 
nose pliers. Hold the flesh tight so pulling the bones doesn't tear it.
</p> 

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; An 11 ounce fish yielded 4.3 ounces of skinless 
fillet (39%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is very thin but comes off easily using 
the standard long knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html">
Method</a>. The skin shrinks fairly severely when fried. The 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Flathead head, bones, fins and skin make a light 
flavored fish stock usable for fish soups and stews. For details see 
our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
Stock</b></a>.</p>
