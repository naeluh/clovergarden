<h1>Flounder Families</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_grays09g.jpg" alt="Whole Rex Sole" class=mrg>
[Families: &nbsp; <i>Achiropsettidae</i> (southern flounders) &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; <i>Bothidae</i> (lefteye flounders) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Paralichthyidae</i> (large-tooth flounders) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Pleuronectidae</i>  (righteye flounders)]
<p>
Flounders include a number of families of fish that have evolved 
to lie flat on the bottom. Their eyes have moved so both are on the side 
marked "up". They make their living by blending into the sea bottom, often 
partially covered with sand, and ambush their prey, but some of them also 
leave the bottom and hunt like regular fish.</p>
<p>In Europe "Sole" means fish of family <i>Soleidae</i>. In North America 
the name is applied haphazardly to various flounders that are not members 
of the <i>Soleidae</i> family - probably because "sole" sounds more 
European and sophisticated. &nbsp; <b><u>Caution:</u></b> &nbsp; Flounders 
are very often mislabeled. Most of the time it doesn't matter much, but 
if what you get is Dover Sole (Slime Fish), it matters a lot. If the fish 
is dark on both sides, use caution.

<h2>California Halibut</h2>

<img src="img/sf_calhal10e.jpg" alt="Whole California Halibut" class=mrg></a>
[California Flounder, Alabato, Southern Flounder; 
<i>Paralichthys californicus</i>]
<p>
This Large-Tooth Flounder is native to both sides of Baja California 
and up the coast to the Canadian border, ranging from the surf zone 
to 600 feet depth. It can grow to nearly 5 feet and 72 pounds, but 
the photo specimen was 23 inches long and weighed 2 pounds 15 ounces 
factory cleaned - probably about 3 pounds 3 ounces with guts included. 
This fish is easily identified by the high arch of the lateral line 
above the pectoral fin. It is considered a very desirable eating fish 
and is not considered endangered, Red List status <b>LC</b> 
(Least Concern).

<h2>Fluke</h2>

[Summer Flounder; <i>Paralichthys dentatus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Southern Flounder; <i>Paralichthys lethostigma</i>]
<p>
Closely related to the California Halibut, these two Large-Tooth 
Flounders are easily confused with each other. As best I can tell, 
the photo specimen is a Summer Flounder, which is common from the 
Florida Panhandle to Maine, but not around the Florida peninsula. To 
a lesser extent it is found along the east coast of Canada and out 
to Nova Scotia. The Southern Flounder is found from the southeast 
coast of Texas to North Carolina, but not along southern Florida. 
Both inhabit shallow coastal waters, estuaries and sometimes even in 
fresh water. The Southern Flounder can grow to 32-1/2 inches long and 
just over 20 pounds while the Summer Flounder can grow to 37 inches 
and 26 pounds, but the photo specimen was 15-3/4 inches long and 
weighed 1 pound 10-1/8 ounces. Red List status for both fish is 
<b>LC</b> (Least Concern).

<h2>Dover Sole / Slime Fish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_doverz.html">
<img src="img/sf_slime06e.jpg" alt="Whole Slime Fish e" class=mrg></a>
[Slime Sole, Slippery Sole; <i>Microstomus pacificus</i>]
<p>
You do not want to buy this fish. This right eyed flounder is not 
anything like the Dover Sole or Common Sole 
(<a href="sf_solez.html"><i>Solea solea</i></a>) of Europe. This 
one's real name is "Slime Fish", and it's mainly processed into mink 
food. It is, however, also sometimes passed off to unsuspecting 
consumers as "Dover Sole", and worse, under some other name. It is 
edible, though insipid, but used in recipes intended for real Dover 
Sole it is an unmitigated disaster. It turns into slimy mush.</p>
<p>Slime Fish infests coastal regions from southern Japan all the 
way around to just south of San Diego, California. This fish can 
grow to about 30 inches long and 7.6 pounds, but the  photo 
specimen was 15-1/2 inches and a little over 1-1/2 pounds.

<h2>Pacific Halibut / Atlantic Halibut</h2>
<br><a href="sf_pachalz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pachal01e.jpg" alt="Two Pacific Halibuts" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Hippoglossus stenolepis</i> (Pacific) &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; <i>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</i> (Atlantic)]
<p>
Pacific Halibut are large righteye flounders growing to almost 9 feet 
long and 500 pounds. They are found from northern Baja California, 
Mexico all they way around to the northern tip of Japan. They are a 
prized eating fish and well known, so other flounder are sometimes 
labeled "Halibut" in markets. I have seen Petrale Sole labeled as "Baby 
Halibut" but it is dark on both sides while Pacific Halibut is white on 
the blind side. This fish can be told from the smaller California Halibut 
from the dorsal and anal fins being more pointy in the center, giving the 
body a diamond shape. Pacific Halibut is not considered endangered, Red 
List status <b>NE</b> (Not Evaluated), but the larger (to 710 pounds) 
<b>Atlantic Halibut</b> is Red List rated "EN" (endangered) and should 
not be fished or eaten.

<h2>Petrale Sole</h2>
<br><a href="sf_petrz.html">
<img src="img/sf_petrale28e.jpg" alt="Whole Petrale Sole" class=mrg></a>
[Brill; <i>Eopsetta jordani</i>]
<p>This righteye flounder is native to the Northeast Pacific coastal 
region from Southern California at the Mexican border north and 
around the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It can grow to 27 inches long 
and 8 pounds but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 1 pound 5 
ounces, a typical market size. This fish is mainly an incidental catch 
off the Pacific coast from northern Baja to the Bering Sea coast of 
Alaska, but there is a designated fishery in Oregon. It is not 
considered threatened, Red List status <b>LC</b> (Least Concern).

<h2>English Sole</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_english02e.jpg" alt="Whole English Sole" class=mrg>
[<i>Parophrys vetulus</i>]
<p>
This righteye flounder is native to the same range as the Petrale Sole: 
the Northeastern Pacific coast from Southern California at the Mexican 
border north and around the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It was once 
a very important commercial catch, but is now at historic lows - 
thought to be due to market forces and laws protecting other bottom 
fish. Brown or speckled brown on top and white to yellow on the blind 
side, it can grow to 22 inches long and 3.3 pounds. I have not yet 
found any of these fish in the big Asian fish markets here in 
Los Angeles. It is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>NE</b> 
(Not Evaluated).

<h2>Plaice</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_plaice01e.jpg" alt="Whole European Plaice" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Pleuronectidae</i>: <i>Pleuronectes platessa</i> 
(European) <i>Hippoglossoides platessoides</i> (American), 
<i>Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus</i> (Alaska)]
<p>
This is a group of medium size right eye flounders. The European can 
get up to 39 inches and is found in the East North Atlantic and Baltic 
Sea. The American gets to 32 inches and is found in the West Atlantic 
as far south as Rhode Island and around Greenland. The Alaskan grows 
to about 24 inches. Plaice is very popular in European recipes and is 
sometimes used for fish and chips, but it's not common on the West 
Coast of North America where Petrale Sole should be a suitable 
substitute. &nbsp; <small>Photo of European Plaice by Hans Hillewaert

<h2>Gray Sole</h2>
<br><a href="sf_graysz.html">
<img src="img/sf_grays09e.jpg" alt="Whole Gray Sole" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Glyptocephalus cynoglossus</i>]
<p>
This righteye flounder is caught in the North Atlantic from North 
Carolina north around the southern tip of Greenland and around the 
European coasts to northern Spain, staying mostly below the Arctic 
Circle. It is often sold in Southern California as "Rex Sole", which 
it clearly isn't - Rex Sole has a very long pectoral fin. 
They can grow to almost 24 inches and 5-1/2 pounds, but the photo 
specimen was 13-3/4 inches long and weighed 10 ounces, typical in the 
markets here - though fish up to 1 pound are frequently seen. The 
population is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>NE</b> 
(Not Evaluated).

<h2>Rex Sole</h2>
<br><a href="sf_rexz.html">
<img src="img/sf_rex08e.jpg" alt="Whole Rex Sole" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Glyptocephalus zachirus</i>]
<p>
This righteye flounder is caught in the North Pacific from Southern 
California to the Russian coast and down to Taiwan. They can grow to 
23 inches and a bit over 4 pounds, but the photo specimen was 15-5/8 
inches long and weighed 1 pound 1-1/4 ounces, typical in the markets 
here. Rex Sole and Gray Sole are often confused in markets, but the 
rex has a very long pectoral fin and the gray a very short one. The 
population is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>NE</b> 
(Not Evaluated).

<h2>Sanddab</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sanddab01e.jpg" alt="Pacific Sanddab e" class=mrg>
[<i>Citharichthys sordidus (pacific), C. xanthostigma (long fin)</i>]
<p>
This lefteye flounder was hugely popular in eateries in the San 
Francisco Bay area of California but is now in short supply because of 
fishery laws designed to protect shallow water rockfish. The sand dab 
itself is not considered threatened. <a href="sf_rexz.html">Rex Sole</a> 
is a perfect substitute (even though it is a righteye flounder from deeper 
water), similar in size, flavor and cooking properties. Sanddabs grow 
to 16 inches but are mostly under 1 pound.

<h2>Starry Flounder</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_staryf01e.jpg" alt="Whole Starry Flounder" class=mrg>
[<i>Platichthys stellatus</i>]
<p>
A very common fish from Santa Barbara California to Arctic Alaska and 
the Sea of Japan. Strangely, it is a righteye flounder but most have their 
eyes on the left side. They grow to 3 feet and 20 pounds. &nbsp;
