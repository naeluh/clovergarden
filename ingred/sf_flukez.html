[Summer Flounder; <i>Paralichthys dentatus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
  Southern Flounder; <i>Paralichthys lethostigma</i>]
<p>
These two large-tooth Flounders are closely related and easily 
confused. As best I can tell, the photo specimen is a Summer Flounder, 
which is common from the Florida Panhandle to Maine, but not around 
the Florida peninsula. To a lesser extent it is found along the east 
coast of Canada and out to Nova Scotia. The Southern Flounder is found 
from the southeast coast of Texas to North Carolina, but not along 
southern Florida. Both inhabit shallow coastal waters, estuaries and 
sometimes even in fresh water. The Southern Flounder can grow to 
32-1/2 inches long and just over 20 pounds while the Summer Flounder 
can grow to 37 inches and 26 pounds, but the photo specimen was 15-3/4 
inches long and weighed 1 pound 10-1/8 ounces. These fish are pure 
white on the blind side. Red List status for both fish is <b>LC</b> 
(Least Concern).</p>

<p>As with some other large-tooth Flounders, these are officially 
"left eyed flounders", but nearly half are right eyed, including 
the photo specimen. These fish start life swimming normally with an 
eye on each side, then one eye migrates to the other side and they 
settle down to life on the bottom - sort of. They get impatient waiting 
for something to eat, so they often go actively hunting well off the 
bottom. They eat mostly small fish, shrimp and small crabs.</p>

<p>The Summer Flounder is the most important East Coast flounder for 
both commercial and sports fishing. Fluke flesh is white, very mild, 
delicate in flavor and texture. It is considered an excellent eating 
fish, especially for people who don't like their fish to taste much 
like fish. I'm sure it is a darling of the fancy chef set, because 
it's flavor will not interfere with their delicate sauces. On the plate, 
it more crumbles than flakes apart, and has a somewhat dry mouth feel.
</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish does very well dusted with rice 
four and pan fried. It can be poached if the pieces are not too large 
and the time very short (4 minutes max), though it will be a bit bland. 
You definitely don't want to try to use it for soup or stews - it will 
just fall apart into tiny fragments.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; The photo specimen was purchased from a 
Philippine market in Los Angeles, for 2014 US $3.99 / pound. this fish 
will be much more common in fish markets on the East Coast.</p>

<p><b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The photo examples below feature a 
<a href="sf_calhalz.html"><b>California Halibut</b></a>, but there is 
very little difference (except the California fish can get a lot bigger).
</p> 

<p><img src="img/sf_calhalo11h.jpg" alt="Scaling" class=mrg>
<b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish has medium size scales on both 
sides. Adhesion is fairly good, so they need a little effort to scrape 
off, and some scales may need to be shaved off, as shown in the photo.

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is easy to clean - there isn't 
a whole lot in it. It is so large you probably won't be cooking it 
head-on, so just remove the head and you can scoop everything out 
easily. Pull the gills out of the head if you will be making stock.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_calhalo13h.jpg" alt="Outlining fillet" class=mrg>
<b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This fish is very easy to fillet. First 
make the usual cuts to remove the head. Next make a cut down the center 
to the backbone. Except right up near the head, just follow the lateral 
line. Next, outline the fillet by cutting in from fin edges through the 
skin at a very shallow angle.
<br class=cll></p> 

<p><img src="img/sf_calhalo14h.jpg" alt="Filleting" class=mrg>
Fillet from the backbone outward for the bottom fillet. Try to stay on 
the right side of the fin rays, but If you should get under them, just 
deepen your fin edge cuts until they meet the main cut. You can do the 
same for the top fillet, but I find it easier to cut from the fin inward 
like for round fish, Do the same for the blind side. Unlike some flat 
fish, this fish is quite meaty on the blind side due, to the amount of 
time it spends hunting off the bottom. You should be easily able to 
produce a "see through" skeleton.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/sf_calhalo18h.jpg" alt="Skinning" class=mrg>
<b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has very moderate shrinkage so fillets can 
be fried skin-on - in fact you can even poach skin on and the skin will 
barely distort the meat, then it becomes very soft. If desired, the 
skin can be removed fairly easily using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The raw skin is quite 
strong, so you can use a fairly steep angle so you take no flesh. You 
will lose the edge where it covered the fin rays, as you can see in the 
photo, but that isn't a lot of meat. Just add it to the stock pot along 
with the skins - or fry it as a snack for the cook, eaten with a few 
drops of lemon juice.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 14 ounce (factory cleaned) fish 
yielded 2 pound 9 ounces of skin-on fillet (66%). Skin off was2 pound 
4-1/2 ounces (58%). A guts-in fish would be more like 53% and 41%, 
still pretty good yield.

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads, bones and fins of this fish make a 
mild, very usable stock.  Be sure to pull the gills from the head as they 
can make a stock bitter. You can include the skins if you have removed 
them from the fillets. For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a> page.
The stock will have a significant amount of oil, which you should remove 
using your gravy separator.
