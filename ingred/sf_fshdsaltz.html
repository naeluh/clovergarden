[Xiang (China)]
<p>
Dry Salted  fish is very popular in China, and used in the rest of 
East and Southeast Asia.  It can be very expensive depending on type of 
fish and especially size. The photo specimens are Yellow Croaker, a 
very prestigious fish in East Asia, fresh or dried. These were 7 inches 
long and weighed 1.6 ounces each in a 7 ounce package. They were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2020 US $15.29 / pound.</p>

<h3>Threadfin</h3> &nbsp; is another fish considered very desirable in 
salt dried form in China. The photo specimens to the left were up to 7 
inches long and weighed an average of 2.3 ounces each. They were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2020 US $15.29 / pound, but that market also had much larger ones, 
over 12 inches long, selling for around $25.50 per pound, averaging 
about $30 per fish.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Dry Salted Fish can be kept at room temperature 
in a well sealed container protected from heat and moisture. <p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fully dried fish needs a fairly long soaking 
before cooking, but not nearly as long as <a href="sf_stockz.html">
<b>Stockfish</b></a> which is dried without salt. The salt retains some 
water, but prevents microbial action. Salted dried fish should be soaked 
for a few hours or overnight.	&Uuml;ber expert Fuchsia Dunlop admits she 
uses instead frozen Vietnamese <a href="sf_fshsaltz.html"><b>Salted 
Mackerel</b></a> when at home in London.
