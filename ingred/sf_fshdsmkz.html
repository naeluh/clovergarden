<h1>Smoke Dried Fish</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_fshsmka01e.jpg" alt="Fish Market in Benin" class=mrg>
Following ancient methods, this smoked fish is far different from 
that common in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Our smoked fish 
still needs refrigeration, but in West Africa and other less developed 
regions fish is still smoked very dry in primitive smoking ovens. Smoke 
dried fish has a very strong smoke flavor and is very dry and brittle, 
needing no refrigeration. Fish that's dried without smoking, as done 
in East Asia, is impractical because of African humidity. This fish needs 
extensive soaking before it can be used in a recipe.

<p>Regulations in California, New York, and probably elsewhere in the 
United States require fish smoked this way to be eviscerated before smoking 
to eliminate the possibility of botulism infection. That is often not done 
in Africa, causing some regulatory problems with imported smoked fish. 
&nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: fish smoked by traditional methods have been shown 
to exceed EU limits for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are 
considered a cancer risk. Consumption should be kept moderate, just as with 
BBQ, which has the same problem.</p>

<h2>Boney Fish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_boney02e.jpg" alt="Several Boney Fish in direpair" class=mrg>
[Bonny Fish (Nigeria); Herring]
<p>
These smoked Herring are quite common in Nigeria. They are very dry and 
extremely fragile. they have a lot of tiny bones, but the ribs and 
backbone are easily removed intact. Most of the remaining bone are too 
tiny to be a problem. The photo specimens, 3-1/2 inch random lengths, 
were "peeled" (scaled) and eviscerated before smoking. They were also 
headless, but I couldn't tell if the heads were removed before smoking 
or snapped off later. They were purchased on-line for 2018 US $15.98 / 
pound.

<h2>Bonga Shad</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_bongaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_bonga05e.jpg" alt="Smoked whole Bonga Shad" class=mrg></a>
[Ethmalose d'Afrique (French); <i>Ethmalosa fimbriata</i>]
<p>
This fish ins very important through most of West Africa. Traditionally 
nearly all were smoked, but as ice becomes more common in the region, 
demand for fresh Bonga Shad is increasing.

<h2>Catfish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_catdry02h.jpg" alt="Whole Dry Smoked Catfish" class=mrg>
This is what has been called "Catfish" in Nigeria. Live Catfish or 
Catfish on ice have been called "Fresh Fish". Under influence of the 
Internet this terminology is fast changing. This is one of the most 
popular smoke dried fish in West Africa, the other being Mackerel. As is 
customary, this African Walking Catfish has had its tail pinned to its 
head, and then been staked up to smoke until it is totally dry and 
crumbly. Smoke dried catfish of this sort is available on-line in North 
America. The photo specimen was 8 ounces and cost 2018 US $21.99 / 
pound.
<p>For recipes, this fish should placed in a heat proof bowl, then pour 
boiling water over it to cover well. Soak for about an hour, then drain 
and pick it apart, removing all the bones. Break the flesh into small 
pieces, as they will remain very firm through cooking. The head is not 
used.

<h3>Dagaa</h3>
<br><a href="sf_dagaaz.html">
<img  src="img/sf_dagaa01c.jpg" alt="Dried Dagaa for sale" class=mrg></a>
Dagaa are dried African fish, but are not smoked. For details see 
our <a href="sf_dagaaz.html"><b>Dagaa</b></a> page.

<h2>Eja Kika</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdkika02e.jpg" alt="Smoked Hake, headless" class=mrg>
[Azu-ishi, Eja Kika, Panla (Nigeria); Hake; <i>Merluccius merluccius</i>]
<p>
This is dry smoked Hake / Whiting. How it gets to Nigeria I don't know, since 
it isn't found much south of Morocco, but it is very popular there. The photo 
specimens are large (largest 4.8 ounces) and headless. More commonly they 
are quite a bit smaller, heads on, with the tails stuck into the mouth to 
make the circle. These were quite meaty, and very easy to break apart and 
remove the skins and bones before soaking for use. These specimens were 
purchased on-line for 2022 US $14.56 / pound + $10 shipping.

<h3>Kapenta</h3>

Kapenta are dried African fish, but are not smoked. For details see 
our <a href="sf_kapentaz.html"><b>Kapenta</b></a> page.

<h2>Kuta Fish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_kuta02e.jpg" alt="Smoked Segment of a Barracuda" class=mrg>
[Kuta (Nigeria); Barracuda]
<p>
Smoked Barracuda is quit popular in Nigeria. Large ones are smoked as pieces, 
but smaller ones are smoked whole, head on, and look very ferocious.  
Fortunately, the coast of West Africa is not a reef environment, so even 
large Barracuda should be safe to eat. Most of the catch will be 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_baraaz.html"><b>Guinean Barracuda</b></a>, but some 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_baraez.html"><b>European Barracuda</b></a> is also present 
along the West African coast. The photo specimen was a chunk 7 inches long 
and weighing 14-3/4 ounces. It was purchased on-line for 2018 US $14.99 / 
pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Titus Fish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_titussmk01e.jpg" alt="Western Smoked Mackerel" class=mrg>
[Titus Fish (Nigeria); Mackerel]
<p>
Mackerel is a very popular fish in West Africa, smoked, and, as ice and 
refrigeration become more common, fresh. I have not yet found African Smoke 
Dried Mackerel for sale in North America, so the photo is borrowed from 
24 Hours Market in Nigeria, 2021 Nigerian Naira &#8358;1200.00 (US $2.88) 
per each. They were described as "Size 2", but no dimension was given. 
Smoke dried Titus Fish is also sold by other sources curled into a donut 
shape.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Mangala</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_mangala04e.jpg" alt="Pieces of Mangala Smoked Fish" class=mrg>
[Mangala (Igbo, Yoruba); Gunten (Hausa)]
<p>
"Mangala" does not refer to a particular fish, but to a method. Large 
shallow water fish are cut into pieces before smoking rather than smoked 
whole. Fish under this name are smoked in northern Nigeria, and may 
include <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_abaz.html"><b>Aba Aba Knifefish</b></a> and various 
Catfish. Much of this fish is sold in southern Nigeria where it is highly 
prized. The photo specimens were Aba Aba and ordered on-line at a cost of 
2022 US $35.00 for 18 ounces (500 gms - $2.19 / ounce).</p>
<p>Instructions were "Soak it, pick it apart, enhance the flavor of the 
mangala fish with a little spice. Throw it into that pot of soup to unleash 
that incredible flavor it packs. Savor every bit of it". Wood smoke is very 
evident in the flavor.

<h2>Bronze Featherback</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_knifebz02d.jpg" alt="Batch of Dry Smoked Featherfish" class=mrg>
[Pla Salat (Thailand); C&aacute; th&aacute;t l&aacute;t (Viet); ngaphe (Burma); 
<i>Notopterus notopterus</i>]
<p>Smoke Drying isn't restricted to Africa. In Thailand, this small 
Featherback is smoke dried and ground for use in Nam Phrik Pla Salat, 
a dipping sauce used for raw vegetables and the like. It's not available 
here in Los Angeles, but probably one of the African fish above would work 
well enough.
