<h1>Fish Sauce - Introduction</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_pdnampla02k.jpg" alt="Bottled Fish Sauces" class=mrg>
<p>
"Fish Sauce" is called for in many recipes on this site, from all 
over Southeast Asian and a few from China and the Roman Empire. This 
page is a quick introduction for persons unsure what the product is. 
It is completely impossible to reproduce the true flavor of ethnic 
cuisines that use fish sauce without using fish sauce. "Fish sauce 
is God stuff" - actual quote from a West Virginia man introduced to 
fish sauce by a college roommate.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that a concentrated fish sauce is used by 
some Italian chefs, but it is unknown if it has any continuity with that 
used during the Roman Empire. Production of fish sauce in Spain ceased 
sometime during the Muslim occupation.</p>

<p>The Fish Sauce we are dealing with here is a perfectly clear dark amber 
liquid with no sediment or cloudiness. It has a distinct aroma of fish but 
this aroma is generally not noticeable after incorporation into a recipe.
</p>

<p><b>Vegetarians:</b> &nbsp; You will find many Southeast Asian recipes 
that are entirely vegetarian except for fish sauce. If you reject all 
seafood products, the closest you can get with pre-prepared ingredients 
is <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html">Thai Yellow Bean Sauce</a>. Bottled 
"vegetarian fish sauces" are sometimes available in markets serving a 
Vietnamese (but not Thai) community, but they are pretty awful. We have 
developed recipes for both clear and murky 
<a href="../recipes/sjv_vegfish1.html">Vegetarian Fish Sauce</a> which 
will give better results than the usual "light soy sauce" or "plain 
salt and water" so often recommended.</p>

main  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfishsauce.html"><b>Fish Sauce</b></a> page.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Fish sauce will be found in all markets that 
serve a Southeast Asian community, and there will probably be many 
brands. Described here are some of the most prominent.

<ul>
  <li><h3>Thai Kitchen</h3> (front left in photo) is the one brand that 
    can now be found in many regular supermarkets, nation-wide. It's of 
    decent quality, but a bit high priced if you use a lot of fish sauce.
    </li>
  <li><h3>Squid Brand:</h3> &nbsp; This is a highly thought of brand that  
    I have used on practically a daily basis (back center in photo). It 
    is slightly lighter than the average Thai fish sauce so is also 
    perfect for Vietnamese cooking. The one problem is, it comes with a 
    "shaker" cap and I want to pour, so I use a utility knife to cut the 
    hole bigger.</li>
  <li><h3>Megachef:</h3> &nbsp; (not shown - tall bright blue bottle). 
    This is my current favorite, a "super-permium" sauce created by the 
    people who make Squid brand.</li>
  <li><h3>Three Crabs Brand:</h3> &nbsp; (not shown) This higher priced 
    sauce has long had a cult following among the foodie set, but is 
    definitely not favored by experienced Thai cooks. It is "fermented in 
    Thailand", but I'm a bit suspicious about what "processed in Hong 
    Kong" means (lead added?), and what are fructose and hydrolized wheat 
    protein (a weasel word for MSG) doing in Fish Sauce? There are several 
    other brands with the exact same fine print coming from the same 
    factory.</li>
  <li><h3>Red Boat:</h3> &nbsp; (not shown) This has recently (2016) 
    taken the foodie set by storm. I guess it's extremely high price is 
    a big factor (it's just got to be better, right?). Though from 
    Vietnam, it is much stronger than Thai, and a bit harsh in my 
    opinion. It is highly recommended by an Internet comparison page, 
    made by just two tasters who have no Asian food credentials whatever. 
    The fish sauces most recommended by experienced Thai cooks are near 
    the bottom of their comparison. Ignore it.</li>
  <li><h3>Tipparos Brand:</h3> &nbsp;  Despite its cheap seeming plastic 
    bottle, this brand is highly thought of by Thai cooks.</li>
  <li><h3>Thai Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Most of the brands you will find 
    in markets are of Thai manufacture. Thailand has been the center of 
    fish sauce production since the fall of the Roman Empire (in Roman 
    times it was Spain).</li>
  <li><h3>Vietnamese Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; is essentially 
    interchangeable with Thai fish sauce - on average a little lighter, 
    but similar to Squid brand.</li>
  <li><h3>Philippine Fish Sauces</h3> (Patis - back right in photo) are 
    considered of lesser quality because they are usually made from a mix 
    of fish types and as a byproduct of making sauces from the sludge left 
    in the tanks. Thai and Vietnamese fish sauce use only anchovies, and 
    it's the sludge sauces that are the byproduct.</li>
  <li><h3>Vegetarian Fish Sauce</h3> is available in some markets serving 
    a Vietnamese community (Vietnamese Buddhism is stricter than Thai). 
    It is not clear and generally pretty awful (see notes in the header 
    paragraph above).</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Storing</h3>: &nbsp; Fish sauce, tightly capped and kept in a cool 
place out of direct sunlight, can be kept at room temperature for up to 
a few months. The contents of a bottle that has been opened and has 
quite a bit of air in it will darken somewhat, but it does not spoil.
