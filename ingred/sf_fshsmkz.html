<h1>Smoked Fish</h1>

<p>
Smoking has been used as a way to preserve fish for thousands of years. 
While no longer necessary for preservation, smoked fish is still very 
popular for snacks and as a recipe ingredient due to its unique 
flavor. Generally, Oily fish are smoked, as they work much better 
than non-oily fish.</p>

<p>Today's smoking methods are different from the distant past, because 
today the fish is salt cured before being smoked. Before the 17th 
century salt was too expensive for such uses, but this changed when the 
great salt pans of Aveiro, Portugal brought the price down. You will 
find modern smoked fish to be quite salty. The salt cure provides a 
safer fish with better texture and reduces the smoking time from days 
to hours.

<h2 id="cold" class=lrg>Cold Smoked Fish</h2>

<p>Cold Smoked fish is a raw fish product. It is considered fine to eat 
cold smoked salmon, but other fish are considered rather iffy and are 
intended to be cooked. The process starts by scaling and cleaning the 
fish. The gills are pulled but the head and tail are most often left 
on. It is then Salt Cured with dry salt or brine. Some brown sugar 
is usually included in the cure for flavor and moisture control. It is 
then refrigerated in free air for 12 hours to develop a sticky coating 
(pellicle) for the smoke to stick to. After the salt cure, it is placed 
in a chamber that smoke is pumped through for 12 to 48 hours at a maximum 
of 77&deg;F/25&deg;C. Because cold smoked fish is in the bacteria growth 
temperature range for some time, great care is needed to assure it is 
safe. Just the same, cooking before eating is advised. The cooking makes 
the flesh much firmer and improves the flavor.</p>

   <h2>Mackerel - Cold Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_maccsmk06g.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Mackerel" class=mrg>
   The photo specimen was 14-1/2 inches long weighing 12-3/8 ounces. It 
   was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
   (Sunland) for 2018 US $7.69 / pound. It was quite salty from the 
   pre-smoking salt cure.<p></p>

   <h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Fillet this fish just as you would a fresh 
   fish. Unlike a fresh mackerel, the skin is very tough and has rather 
   extreme shrink in cooking, so it needs to be removed. Just peel 
   it off, starting at the head end. Yield for skinless fillets is 
   about 71%<p></p>
   
   <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  Grill or broil the fillets until they 
   reaches an internal temperature of over 130&deg;F/55&deg;C. Pan 
   frying and wrapping in foil and baking can also be used.  Various 
   seasonings may be applied before cooking. Coarsely cracked black or 
   mixed pepper corns are very popular. The mix can include black, white, 
   green and pink peppercorns.

   <h2>Salmon - Cold Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_salsmk02g.jpg" alt="Slab of Smoked Salmon Belly" class=mrg>
   Salmon is the only cold smoked fish approved for eating raw. Why 
   Salmon gets this exemption I do not know. The photo specimen slab of 
   Salmon Belly was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los 
   Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $8.69 / pound. It was quite salty from 
   the pre-smoking salt cure.	 Some people consider cold smoked salmon 
   "slimy" and prefer the much drier hot smoked salmon. Smoked Salmon 
   is often used in recipes, such as salads, dips and toppings.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2>Whitefish - Cold Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_whtsmk03g.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Whitefish" class=mrg>
   The photo specimen was 19 inches long weighing 2-1/2 pounds, and was 
   the smallest one I could find in the market's bin. It was purchased 
   from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US 
   $8.49 / pound.

   <p>This fish is very salty from the pre-smoke cure, and tends to 
   break up into large flakes as soon as it is cooked, so it is best 
   used in recipes. Scrambled eggs, salads, chowders and dips and 
   cracker toppings are examples.</p>

   <h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to deal with. It 
   is covered with large scales that are very difficult to scrape off. 
   I suggest you scrape off just enough to make the usual filleting cuts.  
   Cut just through the skin and peel it off, starting at the head end, 
   then deepen the cuts to fillet the fish as usual. Once you get over 
   the backbone at the tail and work forward to the body cavity, just 
   use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone. Pull them from 
   the fillet with long nose pliers. There are also many long sharp 
   centerline pin bones to pull for nearly the length of the body cavity. 
   Unlike most fish, they trend upward rather than straight back, so 
   pull them downward.	Yield is about 66% skin off.<p></p>

   <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Fillets tend to stick to the grill, so the 
   best method for this fish may be to wrap in oiled aluminum foil and 
   roast in the oven. When grilling, I cut the fillets into three pieces: 
   1/3 of the length at the tail end, then cut the skirt from the top 
   at the centerline. This makes pieces that are of reasonably uniform 
   thickness. Cook until it reaches an internal temperature of over 
   130&deg;F/55&deg;C.   
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2>Herring - Cold Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_herras03g.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Herring" class=mrg>
   The photo specimen was 14-1/2 inches long weighing 11-1/8 ounces. It 
   was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
   (Sunland) for 2018 US $5.69 / pound. It was quite salty from the 
   pre-smoking salt cure. The flesh of this fish is heavily infested 
   with long thread bones. You can pull only a few before cooking, but 
   after cooking they are easy to find and remove as you flake the 
   fish apart. Flaking is called for in most recipes.<p></p>

   <h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This fish will have been already scaled, 
   so it is easy to fillet, just as you would a fresh fish. Cut the 
   ribs away from the backbone with shears and pull with long nose 
   pliers, they pull very easily several at a time. The skin is 
   thin but quite tough, and has rather extreme shrink in cooking, 
   so it needs to be removed. Just peel it off, starting at the 
   head end, taking care you don't take any flesh. Yield for skinless 
   fillets is about 59%.<p></p>
   <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Grill or broil it until it reaches an 
   internal temperature of over 130&deg;F/55&deg;C. Pan frying and 
   wrapping in foil and baking can also be used. Once cooked it will 
   flake apart very easily.

<h2 id="hot" class=lrg>Hot Smoked Fish</h2>

<p>In Hot Smoking, the smoke chamber is held at a high temperature and 
the smoking time is much less than for cold smoking.  Care must be 
taken that the fish is cooked fully through, which will determine the 
smoking time. The process starts by scaling and cleaning the fish. The 
gills are pulled but the head and tail are most often left on. It is 
then Salt Cured with dry salt or brine. Some brown sugar is usually 
included in the cure for flavor and moisture control, and sometimes 
other flavorings. It is then refrigerated in free air for 12 hours to 
develop a sticky coating (pellicle) for the smoke to stick to. After 
the salt cure, it is placed in a chamber that smoke is pumped through 
at a temperature of 158&deg; to 176&deg; F (70&deg; to 80&deg; C). 
The final product is ready to eat as a snack, or use in recipes such 
as salads. It is usually eaten cold.</p>

   <h2>Trout - Hot Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_trouthsmk01g.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Trout" class=mrg>
   Hot Smoked fish is completely cooked in the smoking process, and is 
   usually eaten cold and "as is", as a snack or ingredient in salads and 
   the like. It is noticeably salty, due to a preliminary salt cure before 
   smoking. Trout is a very common fish for hot smoking. The skin is 
   tough and inedible, but has no adhesion to the flesh. Once it is 
   removed, the flesh practically falls apart into medium size flakes. 
   The photo specimen was purchased from a large multi-ethnic market 
   in Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2018 US $9.99 / pound, and was 13-3/4 
   inches long and weighed 1 pound 1-1/4 ounces.
   <br class=cll><p></p>

   <h2>Sturgeon - Hot Smoked</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_sturg04g.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Sturgeon" class=mrg>
   Smoked Sturgeon is very popular in Russia, and can sometimes be found 
   in delis serving a Russian community. The photo specimen was purchaed 
   from such a deli in Los Angeles (Glendale) that, unfortunately, no 
   longer exists. It was 27 inches long and weighed 1.6 pounds.
