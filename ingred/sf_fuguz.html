<h1>Fugu</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_fugu03g.jpg" alt="Live Swimming Fugu" class=mrg>
[Pufferfish, Blowfish, Boh-guh (korea), 
  Family <i>Tetraodontidae</i>, usually some species of genus <i>Takifugu</i> 
  (commonly <i>Takifugu rubripes</i> (photo)), <i>Lagocephalus</i> or 
  <i>Sphoeroides</i> but also <i>Diodon</i>]
<p>
A family of fish that puff up to several times their normal size when 
threatened, common in tropical seas, particularly near reefs. Fugu is 
considered a great delicacy in Japan (and Korea) where it is extremely 
expensive and served raw in highly decorative arrangements. It's prepared 
only by trained and licensed fugu chefs - because the eyes and internals 
are so toxic one fish can kill 30 people.</p>
<p>Non-toxic fugu can be farm raised because they don't make the poison 
themselves, they have to consume certain bacteria to do it. Non-toxic 
fugu has generated little interest - without the risk of death it's just 
another fish. Puffers have long been eaten in Florida but are now banned 
taken from some waters due to a different bacterial toxin. Fugu is not 
considered threatened but is not generally marketed in North America.
