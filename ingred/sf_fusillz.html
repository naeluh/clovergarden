[<i>Caesio lunaris </i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish ranges from the northeast coast of Africa 
to the South Pacific islands, from the northern tips of Australia to 
the southern tip of Japan. Lunar Fusiliers can grow to nearly 16 
inches, but the photo specimen, probably from Vietnam, was 9-1/2 
inches and weighed 7-1/4 ounces. This fish is IUCN Red List NE (Not 
Evaluated) and is not endangered</p>
<p>This fish varies in color from silver- blue with a yellow tail to 
the reddish color scheme of the photo specimen, the form in which it 
is commonly marketed here in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Lunar Fusilier is a meaty fish and its flesh has an interesting 
medium flavor. The dark layer under the skin is small and does not have 
a strong taste. The flesh seems very soft when raw, but it becomes very 
firm with cooking.</p>

<p>The flesh firms up and holds together with wet cooking so it can be 
used in soup. Chunks may be skin-on or skin-off, but should go in not 
long before serving. The chunks won't fall apart, but they may get overly 
firm and have a dry texture, probably because this fish has so little 
oil.</p> 

<p>Pan dressed fish steam well and disassembling them on the plate is 
quite manageable, especially if the ribs have been pulled out before 
cooking.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with small 
scales that scrape off easily with very little flying about. The only 
problem with scaling is that the belly is so thin and soft it may split 
while being scraped.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp; Most of the innards seem to be up in the head 
and not easy to get at. The gills are very far forward and pull rather 
hard. For these reasons I recommend immediately removing the head unless 
you really want a head-on fish.  The body cavity extends significantly 
beyond the vent, so make your cut from right in front of the anal fin 
forward to under the chin.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp;  This is an easy fish to fillet with an easy to 
follow bone structure. Cut down from the top to the backbone, then over 
the backbone at the tail until you get to the rib cage. Cut the ribs off 
with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet - they pull very 
easily. There are a quite few significant centerline pin bones, but they 
are easy to locate and pull.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 7-1/4 ounce fish yielded 4-1/4 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (59%) 3-7/8 ounces skin-off (53%). The skirt area is small 
and thin. Best, even with a whole pan dressed fish, to pull the ribs out 
and cut the skirt off.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor. It has 
very moderate shrink, so skin-on fillets can be pan fried successfully. 
The fillets will thicken a bit when flipped to the skin side, but don't 
curl significantly. The skin still adheres well to the flesh after 
cooking and cannot be removed.  Skinning this fish by the normal long 
knife and cutting board method is not difficult if the fish is large, 
say, 8 inches and above. The flesh of small fish may break up some when 
skinning, but the skinning will succeed. Fillets for poaching should be 
skinned so they do not curl.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads (well cleaned and split), bones and 
fins, simmered slowly for about 40 minutes make a serviceable light 
flavored stock with almost no oil. Let the small debris settle to the 
bottom, then decant and remove what oil there is using your gravy 
separator.</p>
