<h1>Fusilier Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_fusilts06f.jpg" alt="Twinstripe Fusilier" class=mrg>
[family <i>Caesionidae</i>]
<p>
These Indo-West Pacific fish are generally non-migratory and reef 
associated, swimming in dense schools. They are related to snappers 
(family <i>Lutjanidae</i>) but are strictly plankton eaters. They may 
not be easy to identify because the same species can adopt a number of 
radically different color schemes. They are important food fish in 
Southeast Asia.

[<i>Caesio lunaris</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish ranges from the northeast coast of Africa 
to the South Pacific islands, from the northern tips of Australia to 
the southern tip of Japan. Lunar Fusiliers can grow to nearly 16 inches, 
but the photo specimen was 9-1/2 inches and weighed 7-1/4 ounces. 
This fish is IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated) and is not endangered.

<p>[<i>Caesio  cuning </i>]
</p><p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish can grow to nearly 24 inches but is generally 
marketed much smaller. The pictured fish was 12-1/2 inches and weighed 14 
ounces. A popular eating fish in the Philippines, it can be found in fish 
markets serving a Philippine community.

<h2>Twinstripe Fusilier</h2>

<img src="img/sf_fusilts06e.jpg" alt="Whole Twinstripe 06e" class=mrg></a>
[Marr's Fusilier; <i>Pterocaesio  marri</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish can grow to nearly 14 inches but is generally 
marketed smaller. The photo specimen was 10 inches and weighed 8 
ounces. A popular eating fish in the Philippines, it can be found in fish 
markets serving a Philippine community. Like other Fusiliers, Twinstripes 
can vary widely in color from silver to red. The ones I've purchased from 
Philippine markets in Los Angeles are very red and marked 
"Redtail Fusilier", but Fishbase and other sources list no such name.
