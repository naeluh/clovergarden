This long, very slender fish is most plentiful in the northeast Atlantic and 
Baltic Sea, but is found from the coast of Morocco, through the Mediterranean 
and Black Sea, and can be found as far west as Iceland. In the Mediterranean 
it is most common from the east coast of Spain, around Italy and through the 
Greek islands. They can grow to nearly 41 inches (104 cm) and 3 pounds (1.4 kg) 
but are usually about 18 inches (45 cm). These fish are a modern fish and 
totally unrelated to the ancient <a href="sf_garz.html">

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These fish can be fried, grilled, baked, smoked, 
or filleted and included in fish soups and stews. They are cooked skin-on 
in all cases. The bones of this fish are green, which discourages some people 
from eating them, but the color is harmless and does not indicate spoilage.
<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These fish are unavailable in the Americas or Asia 
east of the Mediterranean. In Denmark, where they are very popular, they are 
available in spring and again in early autumn. This may be similar in other 
regions. The photo shows them for sale on ice in Italy.<p></p>
