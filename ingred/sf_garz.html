<h1>Gars</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_garalli01g.jpg" alt="Live Alligator Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Lepisosteidae</i>]
<p>
These fish are considered "living fossils", as they have been around for 
over 100 million years, and have retained many primitive features. There 
are now 7 surviving species in two genera, and all but one are listed 
IUCN LC (Least Concern) - clearly a successful family of fish. All are 
fresh water fish that sometimes enter brackish waters but rarely wander 
into the salt sea. All Gars are native to North and Central America and 
the Caribbean region. These fish are totally unrelated to the European 
<a href="sf_garfshz.html"><b>Garfish</b></a>.</p>

<p>Gars don't have the overlapping scales of modern fish, their "Ganoid 
Scales" are interlocking plates of enamel coated bone, pretty much 
inpenytrable to predators. They themselves are fierce predators, usually 
by ambush, and have very toothy jaws. Like some other primitive fish, they 
can breath air.</p>

<p>All the Gars are considered edible, but their eggs are <u>extremely 
toxic</u> to humans.

<br>

<h2 class=lrg>Genus Atractosteus</h2>
<br><br>

<h2>Alligator Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_garalli01f.jpg" alt="Live Alligator Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Atractosteus spatula</i>]
<p>The largest of the Gars, this one can grow to 10 feet (3 meters) and 350 
pounds (160 kg). This fish is found in the river drainages as far north as 
Ohio, as far east as the Florida Panhandle, and along the Gulf of Mexico 
a small way into Mexico. Generally, it is caught wild, but is of interest 
for aquaculture as it is tolerant of water conditions, fast growing, disease 
resistant, and has a high meat yield. It is sold as meat in the Mississippi 
drainage region. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cuban Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_garcuba01f.jpg" alt="Live Cuban Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Atractosteus tristoechus</i>]
<p>The Second largest of the Gars, this one can grow to 6.6 feet (2 meters) 
but are usually around 3.3 feet (1 meter). This fish is found only in lakes, 
rivers and estuaries of  Western Cuba and Isla de la Juventud, just south 
of Cuba. It is subject to subsistence fisheries and IUCN Red List CR 
(Critically Endangered). Aquaculture is in the experimental stages and 
restocking is planned, but neither is far advanced.  Do not catch or eat 
this fish.

<h2>Tropical Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_gartropic02f.jpg" alt="Whole Tropical Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Atractosteus tropicus</i>]
<p>This fish is found in lakes and rivers of both the Pacific and Gulf of 
Mexico drainages of southern Mexico and Central America.  this one can grow 
to 49 inches (125 cm) and 6 pounds (2.9 kg), but are more commonly about 
24 inches (60 cm). 

<p>Some references list the Tropical Gar as toxic to humans, but there is a 
recipe from Tabasco, Mexico that requires them and cooks them with chili, 
limes, and salt. Also I have seen mention that they  are a significant food 
source in Guatemala, and Nicaragua reported landing 87 tonnes in 2011. It 
is certain, however, that their eggs, like those of all Gar, are highly toxic 
to humans. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern)

<h2 class=lrg>Genus Lepisosteus</h2>
<br><br>

<h2>Spotted Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_garspot01f.jpg" alt="Live Spotted Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Lepisosteus oculatus</i>]
<p>This Gar is native to lakes and rivers of North America 
from southern Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico, and from western Texas to the 
Florida Panhandle, with some isolated populations outside that area, including 
one at the southern tip of Florida. They can grow to almost 5 feet long and 
9.7 pounds (4.4 kg), but are more commonly about 3-1/4 feet (100 cm). They 
are a commercial catch in the lower part of their range, but not in the 
Great Lakes region where they are high in mercury and other unhealthy 
substances from industrial pollution. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).

<h2>Longnose Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_garlongnoz01f.jpg" alt="Live Longnose Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Lepisosteus osseus</i>]
<p>This Gar has a wide range, from southern Quebec through the Great Lakes 
region and the Mississippi and Missouri drainages to the Rio Grande river, and 
from New Jersey to central Florida. They can grow to almost 6.6 feet long 
(200 cm) and 50.3 pounds (22.8 kg), but are more commonly about 3-1/4 feet 
(100 cm). To humans, they are primarily a sports fish, but some people 
consider them to be a very good eating fish. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern), 
but are a concern in some states due to overfishing.

<h2>Shortnose Gar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_garshortnoz01f.jpg" alt="Live Shortnose Gar Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Lepisosteus platostomus</i>]
<p>This Gar is found in the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river drainages 
south to the Gulf Coasts of Louisiana, Alabama, and a little into Texas. They 
can grow to 2.9 feet long (88 cm) and 5.7 pounds (2.6 kg), but are more 
commonly about 2 feet (61 cm). They are important to ecologies, but are not 
much used as a food fish. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern), but are a concern 
in Montana and Ohio due to limited range.

2 feet (61 cm). Although edible, they are not a popular food fish. Like all 
Gars, their eggs are highly toxic to humans. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).
