[Red Weke; <i>Mulloidichthys dentatus</i>]
<p>
This Eastern Pacific Goatfish is found from Southern California to 
Peru, but is rare north of the southern tip of Baja and south of 
Panama. The photo specimen is in its night time colors, during the 
day it is white with yellow stripes. It is often marketed in its 
red form, which can be somewhat blotchy. Note that the barbels 
responsible for the name "goatfish" can be tucked in and may not be 
visible. These fish can grow to 12 inches but the photo specimen 
was 11-1/2 inches long and weighed 1l-1/4 ounces. It was purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles at 2014 US $7.99 per pound, 
Labeled "Red Weke / Mexican Goatfish". Red list status: LC (Least 
Concern).</p>
<p>The name Red Weke, according to fishbase, properly belongs to the  
Yellowfin Goatfish (<i>Mulloidichthys vanicolensis</i>) and 
Orange goatfish (<i>Mulloidichthys pfluegeri</i>), two Indo-Pacific 
fish that very much resemble the Mexican Goatfish when in their red 
phase, making positive identification difficult.</p>

<p>Mexican Goatfish is an excellent eating fish. Its flesh is mild, firm 
and white, suitable for most method of cooking. Its unique flavor is most 
enjoyable poached, but it is also very fine pan fried with just a dusting 
of rice flour. Use a very light sauce. The flesh is firm enough to use 
for soups, but should be added near the end of cooking. I don't cook this 
fish whole because of the many large centerline pin bones, other small 
bones associated with the fins, skin shrink and difficulty making sure 
all the transparent scales have been removed. These factors make it 
difficult to deal with at the table.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; So far I have found this fish only in a 
Philippine market in Los Angeles, displayed on ice. It is not common - 
you just buy it when you see it.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with very large but 
rather thin scales that scrape off fairly easily with very little flying 
about. Some may simply fold over, but are easy to pull off with your 
fingers. The main problem is they are very transparent and making sure 
you've rinsed them all off the fish is not easy.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish has a small body cavity and is easy 
to clean, but the throat is so strong you'll have to cut it with shears. 
The gills pull out fairly easily.</p>

<p><b>Fillets:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet but the short 
rib cage is difficult to follow. When you get to the rib cage just use 
your kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone and use long nose 
pliers to pull them from the fillet. There are also many very significant 
centerline pin bones which need to be pulled for the front 2/3 of the 
fillet. They are easy to find in the soft flesh, just pull them straight 
forward with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Fillet yield is moderate due to the fish's large 
head, an 11-1/2 ounce fish yielded 5-3/4 ounces skin-on fillet (50%) 
and 5-1/8 ounces of skinless fillet (45%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin of this fish does not have a strong or 
"off" flavor but it does shrink quite a bit. You can easily pan fry 
fillets skin-on, just fry on the non-skin side, then flip the fillet and 
hold it flat with your turner. For poaching, the skin needs to be removed 
because, though the skin is not strong, neither is the flesh, so it will 
curl up. Once cooked, the skin is nearly non-existent.</p>

<p>This fish is not easy to skin because the skin is so thin and 
fragile. Using the standard <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, 
You have to hold the long knife at as shallow an angle as you can without 
taking flesh, and you'll still probably end up with fairly large patches 
of skin remaining. If it breaks half way, start over from the tip of 
the fillet at the top. Don't worry about modest size patches, they'll 
cause no trouble, but if you have a really big patch, you may be able 
to get under the transparent outer membrane and pull it off - that's 
the part that shrinks, not the color layer under it.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads, fins, bones and skins make an excellent 
light flavored stock suggestive of shrimp (see 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>). There is little 
oil, but remove what there is using your gravy separator.</p>
