<h1>Goatfish / Red Mullet Family</h1>

[Mullet; Family <i>Mullidae</i>]
<p>
Goatfish are a family of tropical and temperate marine fish. Often called 
"Mullet", they are a very popular eating fish in Western and Mediterranean 
Europe, but are little known in North America. Confusingly, they are not 
related to the <a href="sf_mullz.html"><b>Mullet Family</b></a>.

[<i>Mullus surmuletus</i> (striped red mullet) &nbsp; | &nbsp; also 
<i>Mullus barbatus</i> (red mullet)]
<p>
<i>M. surmuletus</i> and <i>M. barbatus</i> are nearly identical, and 
both come in various color schemes, not always red. The photo is of 
<i>M. surmuletus</i>. These are the "Red Mullet" called for in European 
cookbooks, but you're unlikely to find them in North America. 
<i>M. barbatus</i> can grow to 13 inches and 1-1/2 pounds. It is found 
mostly in the western Mediterranean and along the coast of Morocco. 
<i>M. surmuletus</i> can grow to 15 inches and 2 pounds. It is also 
found in the Western Mediterranean and the coast of Morocco, but is 
most common around the British Isles and in the North Sea. Both are 
usually marketed at between 2-1/2 and 8 ounces. Both are IUCN Red List 
LC (Least Concern)

[<i>Mulloidichthys dentatus</i>]
<p>
This Eastern Pacific Goatfish is found from Southern California to 
Peru, but is rare north of the southern tip of Baja and south of 
Panama. The photo specimen is in its night time colors, during the 
day it is white with yellow stripes. It is often marketed in its 
red form, which can be somewhat blotchy. Note that the barbels 
responsible for the name "goatfish" can be tucked in and may not be 
visible. These fish can grow to 12 inches but the photo specimen 
was 11-1/2 inches long and weighed 1l-1/4 ounces. It was purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles at 2014 US $7.99 per pound, 
Labeled "Red Weke / Mexican Goatfish". Red list 
status: LC (Least Concern). &nbsp;

[Ca Phen rau (market); <i>Parupeneus insularis</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Double-bar Goatfish <i>Parupeneus crassilabris</i>]
<p>
This is found in the Pacific from southern Japan 
to northeastern Australia, around almost all the Pacific Islands, 
including Hawaii, and a few may be found off the coast of Mexico and 
Central America. with most other Goatfish, it is only red at night, which 
is its feeding time. These fish can grow to nearly 12 inches, but the 
photo specimen was 10-3/4 inches and weighed 9-5/8 ounces. 
IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern). &nbsp;

<h2>Indian Goatfish / Red Mullet</h2>
<br><a href="sf_mullrdz.html">
<img src="img/sf_goatindi03e.jpg" alt="Indian Goatfish" class=mrg></a>
[Yellow Spot Goatfish, <i>Parupeneus indicus</i>]
<p>
This tropical Indo/Pacific Goatfish is found from the east coast of 
Africa to the southwest coast of Mexico and as far south as the 
northern coast of Australia. It adopts a number of color schemes but 
is often marketd in its red form as "Red Mullet". All have the round 
dark spot at the tail and a large yellow spot at the lateral line 
between the two dorsal fins - but in the red form that spot is only 
faintly visible.</p>

<p>This is a supurb eating fish, but not common here in Southern 
Califronia. They can grow to nearly 18 inches but fish in my test batch 
were about 12-1/2 inches long weighing 1 pound. The photo specimen is a bit 
smaller because the idiots at the market had broken the tails of all the 
larger fish to fit them in a foam tray that was too small - an outrage 
that would never happen in the Philippine and Southeast Asian markets here. 
Red list status: Not Evaluated.

[C&aacute; Ph&egrave;n R&acirc;u (Viet); <i>Parupeneus 
heptacanthus</i>]
<p>
This tropical Indo/Pacific Goatfish is found from the east coast of 
Africa across the Pacific to the west coast of Mexico and South America. 
Some are as far south as the south coast of Australia and the tip of 
Africa. It adopts a number of color schemes but is often marketed in its 
red form, which can be quite blotchy. Note that the barbels responsible 
for the name "goatfish" can be tucked in and may not be visible. These 
fish can grow to nearly 14 inches but the photo specimen was 10-3/4 
inches long weighing 1l ounces. Red list status: Not Evaluated.
