<h1>Spotted Goby</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_gobspot03g.jpg" alt="Two Whole Spotted Gobies" class=mrg>
[family <i>Gobiidae </i> ??]
<p>
   The fish shown here, wild caught in Vietnam, are not any of the 
   "spotted gobies" listed on Fishbase, but fishbase lists 1786 species 
   of goby and has photos of only half of them. I looked at all the 
   photos and didn't find this one, so some goby expert will have to ID 
   it - if it is actually a goby. These fish measured about 5-3/4 inches 
   long and weighed about 1 ounce each. </p>

<p>Gobies are a bit of a challenge for a regular North American fish 
eater. They are very small, some have a unique and fairly strong flavor, 
the skins are tough and turn into glue when heated, they are bony and 
prickly. I have no idea how they're eaten in Asia, but I have come up 
with a method by which these fish can be enjoyed without an undue 
amount of effort.</p>

<p>The flesh is medium colored and has a distinct and fairly assertive 
flavor typical of gobies.</p>

<h3>Buying;</h3> &nbsp; These or similar gobies can be found now and 
then in markets serving Philippine and Southeast Asian communities. They 
are usually at a low price, often US $1.99 per pound.<p></p>

<h3>Method;</h3>

<ol>
<li>Scrape off the scales. This fish has huge scales for its size, 
  but they scrape off pretty easily.</li>
<li>Cut off the head diagonally, forward at the top passing behind the 
  pectoral and pelvic fins. Discard it.</li>
<li>Scrape out the guts. There won't be a lot because the body cavity 
  is very short and most guts went out with the head.</li>
<li>Fillet. Hold down the tail, cut through the tough skin at the tail 
  and fillet in a single stroke forward, leaving the backbone and fins. 
  When you get near the head end move your fingers up just behind the 
  blade to control the cut. Flip over and do the other side.</li>
<li>Dust fillets with lightly salted rice flour. Even though you are 
  going to deep fry you want to do this, or every time the fish hits your 
  spatula or the pan it will stick - the skin turns to glue when heated.
  </li>
<li>Heat enough high temperature oil for deep frying to around 
  400&deg;F/200&deg;C and fry stirring in small batches until lightly 
  browned and crisp. Drain on paper towels. The fillets will curl sharply 
  crosswise and gently lengthwise, but that isn't at all a problem here.
  </li>
<li>Serve with a Southeast Asian fish sauce based dip, or with just a 
  good Philippine vinegar with some salt.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Not tested - don't expect good results.<p></p>
