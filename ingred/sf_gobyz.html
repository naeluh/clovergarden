<h1>Goby Family</h1>

[Family <i>Gobiidae</i>]
<p>
Gobies constitute one of the largest families of fish, but most are very 
small, ranging from 3/8 inches long to 12 inches long, but only a very few 
giant gobies are over 4 inches. Because of their size few gobies are food 
fish, but quite a few are popular aquarium fish.</p>

<p>
This air breathing vegetarian fish, found from India to Tahiti and north 
to China, lives only in brackish waters, particularly in the Mekong Delta of 
Vietnam. It can grow to nearly 8 inches but the photo specimen was 7-1/2 
inches and weighed 0.77 ounces. It was harvested wild in Vietnam where 
this fish is quite popular for a hot-pot soup named after it.

<p>
This is the largest of the Gobies, reaching 26 inches, but most 
commonly 12 inches. It is widespread, found in fresh and brackish 
waters throughout Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the 
Philippines. It is a very lazy ambush hunter, why it is called a 
"Sleeper" - it just gulps down food that swims by its nose. It is 
much sought as an outstanding eating fish, and is also popular 
in aquariums.

<p>
This fish is found in tropical fresh and brackish waters from the east 
coast of Africa to the South Pacific islands. Caught wild and farmed. It is 
absolutely gigantic - for a goby - most of which are between 1 and 4 inches 
long. This one gets as large as 19 inches in brackish water, less in fresh, 
but is generally marketed at about 9 inches and 3.2 oz.

[<i>??</i>]
<p>
The fish shown here, wild caught in Vietnam, are not any of the 
"spotted gobies" listed on Fishbase, but fishbase lists 1786 species 
of goby and has photos of only half of them. I looked at all the 
photos and didn't find this one, so some goby expert will have to 
ID it - if it is actually a goby. These fish measured about 5-3/4 
inches long and weighed about 1 ounce each.

<p>
This fish is native to the coastal regions of tropical India, but 
mostly Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Philippines and northern 
Australia. It is an amphibious fish, often seen feeding on algae in 
extremely shallow water or on mud flats. It can grow to a little over 
8-1/2 inches long, and is sometimes seen in Southeast Asian markets 
(Fishbase). Wikipedia seems a bit confused here, saying that Mud 
Skipper is used in a sour soup called Canh chua l&aacute; giang 
c&aacute; k&egrave;o, and giving the genus name of a fish found 
only in the Indian Ocean. That soup would be made with actual C&aacute; 
K&egrave;o (see above), which is very popular in Vietnam.  IUCN 
Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

<p>
This fish is native to coasts and lagoons all around the 
Mediterranean, and grows to just under 10 inches. It is not much eaten 
in the region except in Venice, Italy where it is important for some 
local dishes. It is fished commercially in the Black Sea and Sea of 
Azov. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Florin Dumitrescu contributed to the

<h2>Round Goby</h2>

[<i>Gobius venetiarum</i>]
<p>
This fish, native to Black and Caspian Sea regions, is now a serious 
invasive species in the Great Lakes region of North America. While it 
out competes a few small native fish, it's impact hasn't been all 
bad. It eats some invasive zebra and quagga  mussels, unfortunately 
not enough to clear them out. It has also become a favored food for 
walleyes and largemouth and smallmouth bass (actually, not bass - 
they are perch, like  the walleye). Some are eaten by lake sturgeon, 
which don't normally eat fish. They are also the salvation of the 
formerly threatened Lake Erie Watersnake, which now eats almost 
nothing but round gobies. These fish can grow to 9.7 inches and 
a weight of 2.8 ounces.
