[<i>Osphronemidae</i> (Gouramies)]
<p>
Gouramies are a family of generally very small fish (most 1 to 3 inches), 
most living in Africa, but in Southeast Asia there are a few species of 
edible size. Many gouramies have a leading ray of the pelvic fins elongated 
into a tentacle which may extend beyond the tail.</p>

threads extending from below the pectoral fins almost to the tail.

if kept moist. Considered a good eating fish it is both fished and 
farmed, and is not considered threatened.
