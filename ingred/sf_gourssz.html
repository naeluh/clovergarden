[C&aacute; Sac Ran (Viet); Pla Salid (Thai); Pla Salit (Filipino); 
<i>Trichogaster pectoralis</i>]
<p>
Found in the rivers of Southeast Asia this fish can grow to nearly 10 
inches and 1 pound in weight, but the photo specimen was 7-1/4 inches 
and weighted 3-1/4 ounces. Note that the pelvic fins have become long 
threads extending from below the pectoral fins almost to the tail. 
Able to breath air, this fish can stay alive for days out of the water 
if kept moist. Considered a good eating fish it is both fished and 
farmed, and is not considered threatened.</p>

<p>Snakeskin Gourami is popular in Southeast Asia, grilled or in soup, 
and is also dried for use in soup in inland areas. The flesh is firm, of 
light color and medium flavor, with a pleasant taste. Unlike many small 
fish with full length fins, this one is easy to disassemble on the plate, 
either pan fried, grilled or steamed. The fins and bones hold together 
well and are manageable.</p>
<p>It is also used to make fermented fish sauces called <i>Pa Daek</i> 
in Laos and <i>Nam Pla Ra</i> in Issan, Thailand. For details see our 
<a href="../recipes/sjf_tukprah1.html"><b>Tuk Prahok Sauce</b></a> 
page.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Snakeskin Gourami can be found in the freezer 
cases of markets serving a Southeast Asian community. The photo specimens 
came from Vietnam, purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
for about 2011 U.S. $3.33 per pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with a dense coat 
of tiny scales. They have good adhesion and require some vigor to scrape 
off. Some of them will have to be shaved off with the sharp edge of your 
prep knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The only practical way to clean this fish is 
to cut off the head. The body cavity is very short, and the innards are 
mushy and poorly defined, but scrape out fairly easily.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet, though 
the fillets are small. The bone structure is complete and easy to follow 
with the filleting knife.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3-1/4 ounce fish yielded 1-1/4 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (38%) and 1 ounce skin-off (31%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is tough and has significant shrink. It 
will curl a fillet fairly badly, though it can be flattened as it finishes 
cooking. When cooking a whole, head-off fish, the skin shrink is not a 
problem because the fish is so small. The skin has a stronger taste than 
the flesh but not unpleasantly so and does not have an "off" flavor. It 
is easily removed from fillets using the standard long knife and 
cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; The most common way to cook this fish will be 
"head off", since the head needs to be removed to get at the innards. It 
can be pan fried, grilled or steamed in this form. The flesh stays firm 
enough for various forms of wet cooking.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Snakeskin heads, bones and fins, simmered gently 
for 1/2 hour, produce a stock of a light tan color with a taste I do not 
like.</p>
