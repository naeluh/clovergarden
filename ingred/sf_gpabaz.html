[<i>Abulon</i> - various species of genus <i>Haliotis</i>]
<p>
There are eight species of abalone off the coast of California, Red, White, 
Black, Pink, Green, Pinto, Flat and Threaded.  Red abalone can get up to a 
foot long but not many get much beyond the 7 inch minimum even though 
harvesting them is highly restricted (free diving only, no SCUBA or air 
tubes, strict limits and closed areas).</p>

<p>All wild abalone populations on the California coast are endangered or 
severely threatened due to poor fishery management, largely the result of 
inadequate data. The only exception is red abalone where severe 
restrictions have been somewhat effective. Some stocks are considered 
beyond natural recovery and must be restored by captive breeding and 
concentration by transplanting, particularly white abalone which is near 
extinction. Stocks in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are 
similarly threatened.</p>

<p>The high price abalone fetches and the short supply has made aquaculture 
viable. Three species are farmed in California: Red (<i>H. rufescens</i>) 
in northern regions, Pink (<i>H. corrugata</i>) and Green (photo <i>H. 
fulgens</i>) in southern regions and Baja California. Abalone are fed 
California giant kelp, the harvest of which is also strictly regulated.

<p>The Internet has plenty of instructions on how to prepare abalone, but  
oriented to divers who catch 7" and larger wild ones. Follow those 
instructions with the 3-1/2 farmed ones we non-divers are likely to get 
and you'll end up with just about nothing. For one thing 
<a href="http://diver.net/seahunt/d_raprep.htm">divers' 
instructions</a> are oriented to making abalone steaks. A 3-1/2 incher 
just isn't going to make steaks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold the abalone in your hand face toward you (holes on the left). Go 
in from the shallow side (opposite the holes) with a dull butter knife and 
scrape along the shell to find the muscle. Scrape it free from the shell. 
It'll be just a little to the front of center.
<p></p></li>
<li>Take your butter knife and scrape all the way around the edge of the 
shell to free the mantle attachment. The abalone should now come completely 
free of the shell.
<p></p></li>
<li>Next remove the viscera from the foot. Except at the head end it's 
attached only to the very edge of the foot muscle where it was attached to 
the shell
<p></p></li>
<li>Now cut down a bit deeper to remove the head from the muscle. You'll 
have to scoop a little out of a cavity in the muscle to get it all.
<p></p></li>
<li>The next step is to scrub your abalone thoroughly with a stiff bristle 
brush under running water. This will remove all the dark coloration leaving 
you a clean foot muscle.
<p></p></li>
<li>Note in the side view the double fringe where the mantle was attached 
to the edge of the shell. Instructions for large abalone tell you to cut 
this away but admit it's perfectly edible. For the uses you'll probably put 
your small abalone to it is not necessary to remove this fringe.
<p></p></li>
<li>It will probably not be necessary to pound the muscle to tenderize it 
as with large abalone, but if you think it's necessary for your particular 
use, slice it into 1/4" thick pieces and pound them with the flat side of 
your kitchen mallet, but not so much the flesh starts to tear apart.</li>
