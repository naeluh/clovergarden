[Ejila (Igbo); Igbin (Nigeria); Ibi, Boi-de-oxal&aacute; (Brazil); 
<i>Achatina achatina</i> and <i>Archachatina marginata</i> (West African) 
and also <i>Lissachatina fulicaof</i> (East Africa), all of family 
<i>Achatinidae</i>]
<p>
These giant snails, native to West Africa, can grow to almost 12 inches 
long. They constitute a major protein source in some parts of West 
Africa.  In the United States they are considered agricultural pests 
of the first order, and seized wherever found.</p>
<p><i>A. achatina</i> has established itself in several Caribbean 
islands and in Florida.  <i>A. marginata</i>, aside from being an 
agricultural pest, can carry nematodes that can cause blindness, brain 
infection and death in humans. The most common Giant African Land Snail 
in the Caribbean and Florida is the East African species 
<i>Lissachatina fulica</i>.

<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; It is very important these snails be cooked 
well before consumption to avoid very serious parasitic nematode 
infections. Greens and vegetables that could possibly have been exposed 
to them should be washed thoroughly and cooked. This may not apply to 
farm hatched and raised snails which could never be exposed to rat 
droppings from which to contract the parasites.<p></p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Live snails are very unlikely to be found 
sold for food in the United States. Here they are most valued as 
pets. Some restaurants do import them frozen from Nigeria, which is 
legal.<p></p>

<h3>Shelling:</h3> &nbsp; There are two methods. In Nigerian markets 
the shells are broken up with a mallet, freeing the snail. A method 
that preserves the shell is to put them in a pot and pour it full of 
just boiled water and soak about 5 minutes. The snails are then pulled 
out with a two pronged fork or similar.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; First, the gut sack is pulled from the foot 
and discarded. An effective method of de-sliming is to scrub them with 
salt and lime or lemon juice. Some people scrub them with Alum, which 
works very well, but some say it softens the flesh, eliminating the 
desirable crunch.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  The foot is generally split in half. Snails 
are pre-cooked in simmering water for 15 to 30 minutes before use in 
recipes. After that, follow the recipe.<p></p>
