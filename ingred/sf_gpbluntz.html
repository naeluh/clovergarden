[Mud Creeper, Matah Merah, Belitong, Chut-chut, Hoy jup jeng (Thai), 
  Longburm (Aust.) <i>Cerithidea obtusa</i>, family <i>Potamididae</i>]
<p>
Found in the brackish waters of mangrove swamps in Southeast Asia 
and Australia, these snails are gathered from the trunks and branches of the 
mangroves and sold live in local markets. The photo specimens were from 
Vietnam and labeled "Top Shell", which they are not. The largest would have 
been about 1-3/4 inches long if the tip hadn't been broken off. The tips are 
generally slightly broken in nature but these have been broken farther down to 
facilitate eating them.</p>

<p>These snails are commonly added to curry soups. The photo specimens were 
from Vietnam and came packed frozen in a curry made of coconut milk and 
mint. They must, of course, be picked out of the soup and eaten 
individually.</p>

<p>While the tip of the shell is generally broken off in nature it is 
broken a bit farther down to facilitate eating. These snails retreat 
far into their shell and cannot be removed with tools. By an implosive 
sucking technique you suck the snail out through the big end of its 
shell directly into your mouth. This is best because you don't really 
want to see what you're eating here.</p>

<p>The operculum, the hard door the snail pulls in to block off the 
entrance to its shell, is probably still with the snail and you'll have 
to deal with it. It's very thin and sometimes sticks to the roof of your 
mouth.</p>

<p>I didn't measure the yield from these snails because it's minute and 
pretty much irrelevant anyway. You aren't going to be eating these as a 
significant source of nutrition unless you live in a mangrove swamp.</p>
