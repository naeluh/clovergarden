[Pink Conch, <i>Tricornis gigas</i>]
<p>
Pronounced "konk", this snail is found throughout the greater Caribbean 
region from South Carolina to Venezuela and around the Atlantic island of 
Bermuda. They can grow to about 13 inches long but the photo specimen is 
8-1/2 inches. They reach sexual maturity in about three years when they 
will be about 8 inches long and weigh about 2 pounds.</p>

<p>Long an important food item in Caribbean it is now in serious decline 
throughout its range. Because much of the region's population is poor and 
lacks education local fishery controls are often ineffective so international 
trade sanctions are in effect. <b><u>It is illegal</u></b> to take any queen 
conch in U.S. waters or to import them, their meat, shells or products made 
from them from a number of countries. Import from some countries is still 
allowed but it's becoming rather expensive due to scarcity. Details at U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (<a href="sf_gpconqz.html#s01">Note-1</a>).</p>

<p>Restocking efforts have failed because captive grown conch lack survival 
instincts and are immediately eaten when placed in the ocean. It has recently 
been discovered that queen conch are turned on by pheromones drifting over 
from wildly mating conch of another species causing them to mate and spawn. 
This opens the possibility of closed cycle aquaculture.</p>

rapidly declining population.</b></span></p>

<p>A 2 pound conch will yield about 7 ounces of edible flesh which is very 
tough and needs a lot of pounding or a long soak in lemon juice to make it 
edible.</p>

<p>Cooking conch follows the same rules as for squid. Cook it very briefly 
or for a long time because after a brief cooking it becomes tough and takes 
long cooking to become tender again. As with squid the flavor will also be 
affected by long cooking so you must sample to prevent overcooking.</p>

<p>Most conch fishers remove the meat by knocking a hole in the shell at 
a particular point and cutting the adductor muscle. Conch can be removed 
without damaging the shell by placing it in salted water, bringing the 
water to a boil and boiling for about 10 minutes, more or less depending 
on size. Another method is by freezing overnight, then thawing and pulling 
the body out of the shell.</p>
