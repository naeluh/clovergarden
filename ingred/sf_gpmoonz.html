canaliculatum</i>]
<p>
Moon Snails are a large, worldwide family of aggressive predators. The 
largest is Lunatia lewisii, which can grow up to 5 inches across. It 
is native to the Eastern Pacific from British Columbia, Canada, south 
to Baja California, Mexico. It primarily eats bivalves, but will eat 
any other molusk it can catch.</p>

<p>The photo specimens (top photo) were purchased live from a large 
Asian market in Alhambra, California. The largest was 2-1/2 inches in 
the longest dimension and weighed 3-1/4 ounces. There was a much larger 
one in the tank, but I wasn't sure if it was alive or not. Yield for 
1 pound 3-3/8 ounces was 5-1/2 ounces (28%) of which 4-3/8 ounces was 
firm meat (23%). </p>

The photo to the left shows what's inside a moon snail shell. It's easy 
to tell the edible parts from the non-edible. The edible parts are firm  
and the rest is pulpy. It is easy to just rub the pulp off the firm 
parts.</p>

<p>To prepare, just toss the snails into boiling water for as long as 
it takes to be able to remove the innards, about 10 minutes. The 
edible part can then be used in recipes or frozen for future use.
