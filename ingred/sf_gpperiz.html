[<i>Littorina littorea</i> (common periwinkle) and related 
<i>Littorina</i> species]
<p>
These small snails can get as large as 2 inches long, but the largest in 
the batch pictured to the left were about 1.2 inches, fairly typical of 
the commercial product.They live mainly in the surf zone of rocky 
coastlines so their shells are quite thick and often worn. The best 
known periwinkle, L. littorea, is native to the North Atlantic shores 
of Europe but seems to have made it to North America fairly early, some 
say with Scandinavians who were known to have cut timber for export to 
Iceland as far south as New Jersey well before Columbus' voyage. This 
species is now also found on the East Pacific coast, from Washington state 
to California. Other 
species live worldwide and vary considerably in shape and decoration.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in Asian markets that have 
circulating water tanks. There are about 78 snails per pound. The photo 
specimens to the left were purchased from a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2017 US $3.99 / pound. They were product of 
USA.<p></p>

<p>Periwinkles are something you eat for entertainment while conversing 
with friends or listening to music. You'll pretty much starve if you 
depend on them for significant nutrition - they're tasty, but there's 
really not a lot in there, and what there is takes some effort to get 
out. While preparing this article I ate 151 of them and it was not at 
all filling. With practice you can eat about 150 an hour.</p>
<p>It may look like way too much trouble to eat them at first, but with 
just a bit of practice you'll be zipping the little critters out of their 
shells without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>It's best to buy your periwinkles from a reliable source with plenty of 
turn-over to assure a minimum of dead ones. Usually this will be an Asian 
market with circulating water tanks.</p>
<ol>
<li>determine if your periwinkles are alive or dead. Rinse them and pour 
them out into a tray, wet, but with no free water. Let them rest for 
a while. Most will relax and open their shells a bit. If they respond to 
a poke on the operculum (the door that closes the shell) they are alive. 
If they try to crawl away they're definitely alive. If they don't open 
up at all, turn them over for awhile and give them some time. They will 
not open if their shell is full of water. If they're dead, the 
operculum is usually pulled way back inside. A sniff test can often 
confirm that one is dead - discard dead ones. Commercially, "climb tanks" 
are used. The snails that climb are alive, those that don't are 
presumed dead. A recent purchase had 7 presumed dead out of 259 snails.
<p></p></li>
<li>Place the live snails in a large bowl, and fill with cold water to 
cover. Tumble them around with your hands for a minute or so, then 
drain. Repeat <u>2 more times</u>. Cover them again with cold water and 
let them stay for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Drain, rinse and drain again.
<p></p></li>
<li>Prepare a light sauce, maybe a lemon butter sauce with white wine. 
Dipping these tiny critters individually in a sauce is quite a hassle 
so you probably want to just cook them in the sauce.	 We have a recipe 
for Philippine 
<a href="../recipes/saf_pwink1.html"><b>Periwinkles in Coconut Milk</b>
</a> with a more complex sauce.<p></p></li>
<li>Bring the sauce to a boil and pour in the snails. Bring it back to a 
boil and simmer, tumbling the snails often, until they pull out of their 
shells easily, from 3 to five minutes.<p></p></li>
<li>Strain the snails out onto a plate or shallow bowl. Pick them up 
individually and pry them out of their shells as shown in the photos. 
Go deep and in the direction shown in the first photo. You'll quickly 
get a hang of how to get under the operculum and draw them out against 
the natural curve of their shell. Some people suck on the shell 
aperture first, which may move the snail farther out.
<p></p></li>
<li>The last photo shows a disassembled periwinkle. The spiral part is the 
digestive organs, gonads and other items which you may eat or discard 
depending on your attitude towards such things. The firm black and white 
foot to the right is the meaty part. Remember to remove the operculum 
(the little disk to the upper right) before eating.</li>
</ol>

This photo shows a Periwinkle Tool I made from coat hanger wire. It is 
more effective than toothpicks for hooking the beast out of the shell, 
but you'll still lose a few that slip too far back into the shell. The 
hook on the business end has to be very short or it won't be able to 
maneuver inside the shell.
