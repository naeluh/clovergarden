<h1>West African Mud Creeper / "Periwinkle"</h1>

From all the photographic evidence I have seen, the West African 
"Periwinkle" is not a Periwinkle at all, but the West African Mud 
Creeper. This brackish water snail is very common from Senegal to 
Camaroon and IUCN listed LC (Least Concern). There are several 
varieties, so exact shell decoration varies.</p>
<p>All photographic evidence I have seen also shows their flesh to 
be a very unappetizing blue green color - nonetheless, it is a very 
popular inclusion in soups and stews, particularly in Nigeria.

In West African markets, these snails are usually shelled by the vendors, 
right there in the market. They appear as in the photo to the left, but 
often more greenish. Given how easily they are scooched out of their 
shells, I'm pretty sure they have been given a short boil before 
shelling.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These snails are very unlikely to be found in 
North America, though related Asian Creeper species may be found in the 
frozen food cases of big Asian markets here in Southern California. they 
are not blue.<p></p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3> &nbsp; The most conveniently available substitute 
is real Periwinkles, which can be found live and as frozen meat in the 
Asian markets here in Los Angeles, and at affordable prices. Unfortunately 
for purists, they aren't that horrid blue green color - you'll just 
have to live without it. For details see our <a href="sf_gpperiz.html">
