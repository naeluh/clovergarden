[<i>Busycotypus canaliculatus</i>, formerly <i>Busycon canaliculatum</i>]
<p>
    This light shelled whelk is native to the east coast of North 
    America, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts south to northern Florida, and 
    has been introduced to San Francisco Bay.  This whelk feeds on hard 
    shelled clams, which it pries open with the edge of its shell, which 
    tends to be chipped as in the photo. They are preyed upon by blue 
    crabs.</p>
    <p>The photo specimens were purchased live from a large Asian 
    market in Alhambra, California. The largest was 6-1/4 inches long 
    and weighed 8-3/8 ounces. Yield was 2-3/4 ounces (33%) of flesh after 
    steaming long enough to release it.</p>

<li>Let your whelks relax for a while, then check them to make sure they're 
alive. If you poke them they should respond by pulling tighter into their 
shells. Discard any dead ones and scrub the live ones under cold running 
water with a stiff brush to remove extraneous muck and miscellaneous 
sea life.<p></p></li>

<li>Let the whelks relax while you boil up a big pot of salted water, then 
toss them in and bring it back up to a boil as quickly as possible. Once 
it's back to a boil let them cook for about 15 minutes.<p></p></li>

<li>Cool the whelks in cold water until you can handle them easily. you 
can use any appropriate tool to get under the operculum (the hard door 
that closes after the snail) and pull it out of the shell. The whole snail 
may come out intact, or the edible part may break off leaving the rest 
in the shell. The photo to the left shows the complete contents of the 
shell (left) and just the edible parts (right).
<p></p></li>

<li>Under cold running water wash out any gooky stuff. Rubbery stuff is all 
edible including siphons, but gooky parts are not.<p></p></li>

<li>Find the whelk's mouth. It's right between two short tentacles. The 
photo shows the operculum below, the foot facing you and the mouth just 
above the foot. Now insert your filleting knife into the mouth sharp side 
up and split the gut open so you can wash out the last of the gooky stuff.
<p></p></li>

<li>Pull off the operculum and you should now have a nice clean and edible 
hunk of whelk. In general it's not so tough as to need pounding unless you 
want it extra tender.You can eat it immediately or freeze for later.</li>

These shells can be attractive if cleaned up.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; Cook your snails and remove the meat for whatever use you 
have in mind.
<br>2. &nbsp; Return the shells to the pot and cover well with water. Bring 
to a boil and simmer for a long time. Occasionally tilt them pointy end down 
under the water to fill them. 
<br>3. &nbsp; Cool and drain. Shake the crud out by this means. Hold the 
shell pointy end down and fill with hot water. Turn pointy end up and shake 
up and down vigorously. Repeat until you're sure all the crud has been 
shaken out.
<br>4. &nbsp; Scrub the shells with a stiff bristle brush and by whatever 
other means you have, until they are clean.
<br>4. &nbsp; Return to the pot and cover with water. Add bleach to about 
20% of the liquid. Turn the shells pointy end down under water to fill them. 
<br>5. &nbsp; Bring to a boil and simmer until they are a nice color.
<br>6. &nbsp; Rub them with mineral oil to keep them bright and preserve 
the colors.
