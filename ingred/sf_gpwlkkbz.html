[<i>Busycon carica</i>]
<p>
This large, heavy shelled whelk is native to the east coast of North 
America, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to northern Florida. It 
feeds on clams, mussels and oysters, which it pries open with the 
edge of its shell, which tends to be a bit chipped. Once the clam 
is slightly opened, the whelk extends it's mouth into the shell. It 
then shreds the victim alive with it's rasp like radula, and digests 
it. These whelks are preyed upon by crabs. and starfish.
They can grow to 12 inches long, but the larger one in the photo was 
7-3/4 inches and weighed 2 pounds.</p>
<p>The one to the right shows an edge of the foot with attached hard 
operculum, which acts as a door, closing off the aperture when the snail 
feels threatened and retreats into its shell.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimens were purchased at a large 
Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US $3.99 /p pound. 
They are usually labeled "Conch", which they are not. This is not 
a snail that's normally in stock, it's strictly a "buy it when you 
see it" item.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Three whelks weighing 4 pound 13 ounces yielded 
16 ounces of edible flesh (21%). At $3.99 per pound, that comes to 
$19.18 per pound of edible flesh.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; These whelks are cleaned about the same as 
other whelks, differing mainly in size - these are usually quite a 
bit larger.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Let your whelks relax for a while, then check them to make sure they're 
alive. If you poke them they should respond by pulling tighter into their 
shells. Discard any dead ones (unless you know they just died) and scrub 
the live ones under cold running water with a stiff brush to remove 
extraneous muck and miscellaneous sea life.<p></p></li>

<li>Let the whelks relax while you boil up a big pot of salted water, then 
toss them in and bring it back up to a boil as quickly as possible. Once 
it's back to a boil let them cook for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on 
size.<p></p></li>

<li>Cool the whelks in cold water until you can handle them easily. A 
salad fork is an excellent tool to pry the snail out far enough so you 
can get a firm grip on it. Once you have a good grip, pull it out as if 
unwinding it from its shell. If you are lucky the whole thing will come 
out in one piece. Otherwise, some of the inedible part may remain in the 
shell. The operculum (the hard door that closes the shell) will probably 
be knocked off. Photo #1 shows the complete contents of the shell. 
<p></p></li>

<li>Pull off the gooky inedible part as shown in Photo #2. It should 
come off intact, leaving little on the edible part. Under cold running 
water wash out any gooky stuff. Rubbery stuff is all edible, including 
siphons and the thin mantle, but gooky parts are not.<p></p></li>

<li>Clean out between the body and the mantle. There are gills in there, 
similar to fish gills but without the prickly gill rakers, and some 
other stuff.<p></p></li>

<li>Find the whelk's false mouth. It's right between two short tentacles. 
and just above the foot, as in Photo #3. Now insert your filleting knife 
into the false mouth,  sharp edge up, and split the foregut all the way 
back as shown in Photo #4. Clean everything out, which will include the 
real mouth and it's rasp-like radula, at the end of the extensible 
proboscis.
<p></p></li>

<li>You should now have a nice clean and edible hunk of whelk, as shown 
in Photo #5. You can use it now, or freeze for later.
<p></p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> if everything didn't pull out of the shell but you want 
to keep the shell, that stuff won't come out easily, and it will be 
smelly for a while. If you can find a convenient ant hill, place the 
shells near it and let the ants clean it out.</p>
