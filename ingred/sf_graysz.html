<h1>Gray Sole</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_grays09g.jpg" alt="Gray Sole" class=mrg>
[<i>Glyptocephalus cynoglossus</i>]
<p>
This righteye flounder is caught in the North Atlantic from North 
Carolina north around the southern tip of Greenland and around the 
European coasts to northern Spain, staying mostly below the Arctic 
Circle. It is often sold in Southern California as "Rex Sole", which 
it clearly isn't - Rex Sole has a very long pectoral fin. 
They can grow to almost 24 inches and 5-1/2 pounds, but the photo 
specimen was 13-3/4 inches long and weighed 10 ounces, typical in the 
markets here - though fish up to 1 pound are frequently seen. The 
population is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>NE</b> 
(Not Evaluated).

<p>The flesh of Gray Sole is white, tender, fine grained and mild. 
This fish is an excellent substitute for the once common Sanddab, a 
lefteye flounder that lives in shallower water, but is now scarce in 
markets due to fishery regulations aimed at protecting rockfish. </p>

<p>Because it's inconvenient to fillet small fish, gray sole is usually 
sold either whole or "pan ready" (head, innards, tail and fins removed). 
Our <a href="sf_graysz.html#ready"><b>Pan Ready Method</b></a> covers making fish 
"pan ready" and cooking them in that form.</p>

<p>For some uses a pan ready fish is fine if properly handled, but for 
other recipes a pan ready fish just won't work - it'll fill the food with 
hundreds of tiny bones. for these uses you must fillet. Gray Sole isn't 
difficult to fillet but get the biggest fish you can to make it easier - 
<a href="sf_graysz.html#fillet"><b>Fillet Method</b></a>.

<p>A 1 pound fish will yield just over 6-1/2 oz of fillet (40%). A 10 ounce 
fish will yield just over 4 ounces (40%). Don't attempt to skin fillets, 
you'll likely break them up. The skin is very thin and normally left on. 
If you pan fry a fillet "skin-on" the skin will shrink a little but then 
relax as it cooks.</p>

<p> The head and bones and fins make a moderate flavored stock with a 
somewhat "oceany" flavor and aroma. There's quite a bit of oil which 
should be removed using your gravy separator.</p>

<h3 id="fillet">Fillet Method for Gray Sole</h3>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish. Gray sole is covered with very tiny scales and the shape 
of the fish makes it difficult to scrape with the back of a knife as for other 
fish, but I find the toothy edge of a grapefruit spoon works just fine.</li>
<li>Clean the fish. Make a small cut on the blind (white) side and use your 
littlest finger to pull the innards out <b>- OR - </b> just remove the 
head with the innards as shown in the procedure for <a href="sf_graysz.html#ready">Pan 
Ready</a></li>
<li>Make a cut along the centerline deep enough to cut all the way to the 
backbone. The fillet is going to break in half anyway so we might as well 
make our work easy. Make the usual cuts under the front fins and collar 
to release the fillet from the head, and make a cut at a very shallow 
angle along the fin edges as shown.</li>
<li>Fillet from the centerline out following the bones. Should you 
accidentally get under the fin rays at the transition (quite likely 
on the thinner blind side) you can just deepen your fin edge outline cut 
until it meets the main cut.</li>
<li>You should end up with 4 long narrow fillets and bones with very little 
flesh adhering to them.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ready">Pan Ready Method for Gray Sole</h3>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish as per <a href="sf_graysz.html#fillet">Fillet Method</a>.
<li>Make a cut under the collar and front fins as you would for fillet. 
Then take your kitchen shears and cut the backbone from the top just 
behind the head.</li>
<li>Pull the head away and it'll pull out all the innards with it.</li>
<li>Use your kitchen knife to cut off the fins, cutting just within the 
margin. No, you can't just cut in farther and remove the fin rays at this 
point, they overlap the main bones. Cut off the tail if you wish.</li>
<li>You are now ready to cook the fish by any appropriate method. Shown in 
the picture is steaming and pan frying but broiling would work well too.</li>
<li><b>If steamed or poached:</b> the skin is likely broken up and unsightly. 
To remove it just press a paper towel over it, the skin will peel up with 
the towel. Do not attempt to remove the bottom skin, it's very thin, white, 
on the underside anyway and traditionally left on.</li>
<li>You could now serve the cooked fish and let the diners deal with the 
bones, but they'll appreciate not having to. With the fish on your cutting 
board, best side up, use your kitchen knife to scrape the fin rays away 
from the fish. Yes, you'll lose a little flesh but the flesh 
there is kind of gelatinous which some people don't like.anyway.</li>
<li>Serve in whatever way you please. The backbone and it's bones will 
still be in the fish but they will stay together and be very easy to deal 
with. There will be no loose bones at all.</li>
</ol>
