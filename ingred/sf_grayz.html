[Genus <i>Thymallus</i>] 
</p><p>
These fish belong to the Salmon family along with Trout and Whitefish. 
They inhabit fresh waters in the far north and are easy to tell from trout by 
their large scales and a very large and showy dorsal fin. The longest and 
most commercialized (wild and farmed) is the Arctic Grayling (<i>T. arcticus 
arcticus</i>) which may grow to 30 inches and over 8 pounds. The grayling 
proper (<i>T. thymallus,</i>) is a European species that may grow to 24 
inches and weigh as much as 15 pounds.
