[Lapu-Lapu (Philippine); <i>Epinephelus heniochus</i>]
<p>
This Indo West-Pacific fish is found from the western side of Java to 
the Philippines and from southern Japan to northern Australia. 
It can grow to 13-3/4 inches, but the photo specimen was 12-1/8 inches 
and weighed 14-1/2 ounces. This fish is caught wild, and is ICUN 
Red List LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p>Grouper (various species) is highly regarded by restaurant chefs, 
because the delicate white flesh works well with their sauces. 
Consequently Groupers are premium priced fish. This grouper's adheres to 
the pattern, mild, but with enough flavor to be interesting.There is a 
thin darker center band just under the skin which has a slightly 
stronger flavor, but it is not offensive. Fillets hold together well 
enough for poaching if handled gently and they flake apart easily on 
the plate.</p>

<p><b>Buying</b> &nbsp; I see this Grouper on ice in Philippine markets, 
The photo specimen was purchased at a large Philippine market in 
Los Angeles, (Eagle Rock) for 2019 US $4.99 / pound. Due to poor 
yield, this is quite an expensive fish, around $15 per edible pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with small but tightly 
adhering scales that take some energy to scrape off, and they fly about. 
Some of them will flip over rather than come loose, and you will need 
to shave those off with the sharp edge of your prep knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This isn't the easiest fish to clean as there 
are a lot of tough membranes inside. The gills pull out very hard, and 
you may want to cut them loose at the ends with your kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not a difficult fish to fillet, but 
dive sharply under the collar because there's quite a bit of flesh there. 
When you get down to the rib cage it's easiest to cut the ribs from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet. There are 
some long sharp centerline pin bones for the length of the body cavity 
you should pull out with your long nose pliers. Pull straight forward 
as usual. The skirt will have almost no flesh on it, so just cut it off 
and toss in the stock pot.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 14-1/2 ounce fish yielded 4-3/4 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (33%), or 29% skin off. The yield is not great because 
of the head is large and long.<p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor, but 
shrinks a lot when cooked, so must usually be removed. Fortunately 
it's a relatively easy fish to skin using the usual long knife and 
cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, because 
the raw skin is tough. Cooked, it just about disappears. </p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; This is an excellent fish for stock. There will 
still be quite a bit of flesh on the head and the bottom of the collar 
which is difficult to recover due to the bones. Stock made from the 
head, fins and bones is mild and quite usable. For details see our
