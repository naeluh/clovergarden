[<i>Epinephelus areolatus</i>]
<p>
This Indo West-Pacific fish is found from South Africa to Fiji and north 
as far as Japan. It can grow to 18 inches and 3 pounds but the photo 
specimen was 13-1/2  inches and weighed 1 pound. This fish is both 
caught wild and farmed. It is kosher and not considered threatened.

<p>The flesh of this grouper is very white and delicate in flavor. Fillets 
hold together well enough for poaching if handled gently and they flake 
apart very easily on the plate. It is easy to bone completely and an 
ideal fish for the most delicate sauces.</p>

<p>Grouper is called for in many cookbook recipes and its characteristics 
make it desirable for upscale restaurants so it is often expensive. This 
grouper tastes about the same as, say, 
<a href="sf_groupstz.html">Strawberry Grouper</a> but is not so stunning 
in appearance, and it is now farmed so prices tend to be quite reasonable.

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with moderate sized but 
hard and tightly adhering scales that take some energy to scrape off, 
and they fly all about as you do so. They are particularly a problem at 
the edges and you may need to pick some off with long nose pliers or 
shave them off with the sharp edge of your prep knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This isn't the easiest fish to clean as there 
are a lot of tough membranes inside. You'll want to cut the gill arches 
loose with your kitchen shears because they pull very hard.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not a difficult fish to fillet, but 
dive sharply under the collar because there's quite a bit of flesh there. 
When you get down to the rib cage it's easiest to cut the ribs from the 
backbone and pull them from the fillet. There are some long sharp 
centerline spines for the length of the body cavity you should pull 
out with your long nose pliers. Pull straight forward as usual.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound fish yielded 1/2 pound of skinless 
fillet (50%), rather better than some other groupers. <p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks a lot when cooked so must be 
removed. Fortunately it's a relatively easy fish to skin using the usual 
long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; This is an excellent fish for stock. There will 
still be quite a bit of flesh on the head and the bottom of the collar 
which is difficult to recover due to the bones. Stock made from the 
head, fins and bones is mild and quite usable. For details see our
