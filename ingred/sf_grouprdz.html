[Brown Grouper, Deer Grouper (Bahamas), <i>Epinephelus morio</i>]
<p>
This West Atlantic fish is found from North Carolina to Southern Brazil 
and all around the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. It can grow to 49 inches 
and 50 pounds but the photo specimen was 16-1/2 inches and weighed 
1-1/2 pound.  This fish is Red Listed as <b>NT</b> (Near Threatened).</p>

<p>The flesh of this grouper is very white and delicate in flavor and 
texture.  Small fillets hold together well enough for poaching if 
handled gently, and they flake apart very easily on the plate. It is 
easy to bone completely and an ideal fish for delicate sauces.</p>

<p>Grouper is called for in many cookbook recipes. Its characteristics 
make it desirable for upscale restaurants, and it isn't yet farmed so it 
is more expensive than many other fish.</p>

<p><b>Scales</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with smallish 
scales that adhere tightly and take some energy to scrape off. You may 
need to shave some of them off with the sharp edge of your kitchen 
knife, particularly at the edges, and may need to pull some with your 
long nosed pliers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This isn't the easiest fish to clean as there 
are a lot of tough membranes inside. You'll want to cut the gill arches 
loose with your kitchen shears because they pull very hard.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not a difficult fish to fillet, but 
dive sharply under the collar because there's quite a bit of flesh there. 
When you get down to the rib cage it's easiest to cut the ribs from the 
backbone and pull them from the fillet. There are some long sharp 
centerline spines for the length of the body cavity you should pull 
out with your long nose pliers. Pull straight forward as usual.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 2-1/2 pound fish yielded 1 pound of skinless 
fillet (40%) - a decent yield and similar to other groupers.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks severely when fried so must be 
removed. Fortunately it's a relatively easy fish to skin using the usual 
long knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html">
<b>Method</b></a>.<p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; There is an excellent fish for stock. There will 
still be quite a bit of flesh left on the head, and especially on the 
bottom of the collar, which is difficult to recover due to the bones. 
Stock made from the head, fins and bones is mild and quite usable.
