<h1>Grouper Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_groupar02g.jpg" alt="Areolate Grouper" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Serranidae</i>]
<p>
Groupers are a group of ocean fish of the same family as 
<a href="sf_bassz.html">Sea Bass</a> and with very similar in 
characteristics. The most famous are the Giant and Goliath Groupers which 
can grow to around 1000 pounds - pretty big bass. All groupers meet kosher 
requirements but many species are Red Listed as <b>VU</b> (vulnerable) or 
<b>EN</b> (Endangered).</p>

This Indo West-Pacific fish is found from the west coast of Africa, in 
the Red Sea, and on to Fiji in the Pacific. It is found as far north 
as southern Japan down to the north coast of Australia, where it is 
very common. It can grow to 18 inches and 3 pounds but the photo 
specimen was 13-1/2  inches and weighed 1 pound. This fish is both caught 
wild and farmed. This fish is not IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).

[Jewfish; <i>Epinephelus itajara</i>]
<p>
This fish which grows to 98 inches and near 1000 pounds occasionally 
attempts to eat scuba divers. It is found in warmer Atlantic waters 
of both North and South America and western Africa. It particularly 
likes to live in caves and shipwrecks. This fish has been greatly 
depleted, mainly by sport spear fishing - <b>this fish is Red Listed 
CR (Critically Endangered)</b> - do not catch, do not spear, do not 
eat (severe Federal fines for posession). <br class=cll></p>

<h2>Giant Grouper</h2>

[<i>Epinephelus lanceolatus</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish grows to over 100 inches and 880 pounds 
and is found from South Africa to Hawaii. It's habits and 
characteristics are very similar to the 
<a href="sf_groupgoz.html">Goliath Grouper</a> of the American 
coasts. This fish has been over-fished and is Red Listed as <b>VU</b> 
(Vulnerable). Some aquaculture has been established. &nbsp;

<p>
This East Pacific fish is found from California at the Mexican border 
south to Peru. It can grow to over 39 inches, but the photo specimen 
was 23 inches long and weighed about 6 pounds.  This fish lives in 
depths between 150 and 300 feet and is subject only to minor 
commercial harvest, Red Listed as <b>LC</b> (Least Concern).

<h2>Strawberry Grouper / Golden Hind</h2>
<br><a href="sf_groupstz.html">
<img src="img/sf_groupst04e.jpg" alt="Whole Strawberry Grouper" class=mrg></a> 
[Golden Hind (fb), <i>Cephalopholis aurantia</i> |  Strawberry Hind (fb), 
Strawberry Grouper,  <i>Cephalopholis spiloparaea</i>]
<p>
Fishbase ascribes "strawberry grouper" to <i>C. spiloparaea</i> but 
the photo specimen is a half inch longer than that fish gets. Consequently 
I'm assigning "Strawberry Grouper" to both these nearly identical fish. 
Both are Indo Pacific fish found from Mozambique (<i>C. 
Spiloparaea only</i>) to French Polynesia. Both are deep water reef 
fish of similar habit. <i>C. spiloparaea</i> can grow to nearly 12 inches 
and <i>C. aurantia</i> to 23 inches but the photo specimen was 12-1/2  
inches and weighed 1.4 pounds. Neither fish is Red Listed.
