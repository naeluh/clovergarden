[Redfish (fishbase), Eastern Nannygai, Koarea; <i>Centroberyx affinis</i>]
<p>
Not actually a snapper, but related to the 
<a href="sf_soldbez.html">Squirrelfish / Soldierfish</a>, this fish 
is found from northern Tasmania north to the central coast of 
Australia, and also around New Zealand and New Caledonia. It can grow 
to over 20 inches long and 4 pounds, but is commonly less than 16 
inches. The photo specimen, from New Zealand, was 15 inches long and 
weighed 1 pound 15-1/2 ounces. This fish is not considered threatened, 
IUCN Red List rated <b>NE</b> (Not Evaluated). It is a commercially 
exploited fish within its range.</p>

<p>This fish is a bit of a hassle to deal with (it takes the class name 
"bony fishes" seriously), but the flesh is bright white with an 
outstanding  mild flavor and good texture.  It holds together well enough 
for poaching but not for extended wet cooking. There is a thin darker 
layer right under the skin along the centerline, but it's flavor is not 
much stronger than the rest of the flesh. The skin cooks up a beautiful 
bright red, but has considerable shrink. Keep it on if you can, perhaps 
score in a diamond pattern for some methods of cooking.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is not at all a common fish here in 
Southern California. The photo specimen was purchased at an Asian market 
in Los Angeles (Alhambra, actually) for 2015 US $9.99 per pound, 
definitely a premium priced fish.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; The scales are fairly large and very stiff with 
strong adhesion. They scrape off rather hard, but with only moderate 
flying about. You will have to pull some off with long nose pliers. There 
is a row of sharp pointy scales between the pelvic (bottom) fins.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; This fish presents no unusual problems in 
cleaning, but the gills pull very hard so need to be cut out with kitchen 
shears. The esophagus is tough, so it will have to be cut as well. Handle 
carefully, because it has quite a few prickly spines.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This is a reasonably easy fish to fillet, with 
coherent bone and fin structure. I usually remove the head before 
filleting. When you get to the rib cage, just cut the ribs away from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet using long 
nose pliers. They pull hard, but cleanly. There are a few substantial 
centerline spines, long and sharp enough to be dangerous, but they are 
are not easy to find and even harder to pull.  Eat with care, in case 
you missed one.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor, but 
does have fairly strong shrink. It does weaken during cooking and fillets 
can be pan fried skin-on if you press them flat after turning them skin 
side down. This is easiest done if the fillets are cut in half along the 
centerline. The skin is tough enough fillets can be skinned rather easily 
using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Removed skins should be 
added to the stock pot with the heads, fins and bones.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 15-1/2 ounce fish yielded 15 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (48%), and 14 ounces skinless (44%). Yield is a little 
low due to the heavy head and bones, but do not discard them - see 
Stock below<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp;  The head, bones, fins and skins make one of 
the best soup stocks you will ever taste. It is almost clear, but with 
a moderate amount of clear oil. Remove this using your gravy separator. For 
details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a>
