[<i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i>]
<p>
This is a highly commercial North Atlantic fish closely related to cod, 
found from the Arctic Circle to as far south as New Jersey and the north 
coast of France. They can get as large as 39 inches and 37 pounds.</p>
<p>Haddock flesh is much like cod, white, firm, low fat and holds 
together well when cooked. It is much used for British Fish and Chips. 
Haddock are sold fresh, dried and smoked, but, unlike cod, they don't 
take salting well.

<p>Presumably prep and cooking for Haddock should be similar to 
<a href="sf_codpacz.html"><b>Pacific Cod</b></a>, but I'm not sure 
because we don't have haddock on the West Coast of North America.</p>
