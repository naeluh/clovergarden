<h1>Japanese Halfbeak</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_hbjap01g.jpg" alt="Three Whole Japanese Halbeak Fish" class=mrg>
[Sayori (Japan); <i>Hyporhamphus sajori</i>]
<p>
Native from around Taiwan north to Vladavastok, including both coasts of 
Japan, the coast of Korea and all around the Sea of Japan. This is 
considered a delicious eating fish, The bottom jaw is very long, and the 
top jaw very short, thus, "halfbeak". This fish can grow to 15-3/4 
inches, but the photo specimens were about 5-1/2 inches long including 
the beak, weighing 5 to the ounce. They were labeled "wild caught" and 
product of Vietnam, but must have been caught at least as far north as 
Taiwan. This fish is very common and IUCN Red list NE (Not Evaluated).

These fish are considered tasty and quite popular in Japan, but used in 
a much larger size than the ones I have found here in Los Angeles. These 
tiny ones are to be eaten "heads, guts and feathers" (and beak too). 
Those in the photo to the left were cooked quite successfully following 
our recipe for Vietnamese <a href="../recipes/saf_smeltvd1.html"><b>Fried 
Smelts with Dipping Sauce</b></a>.</p>

<p>The best thing about these fish is that, if you fry them beak-on, 
which I always do (the beak gets crisp and edible), you can tell your 
guests they are Baby Swordfish. Guests will be delighted, impressed, 
or outraged, depending on their ecological sensitivities.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is not common here in Southern 
California, but does ocassionally appear in the freezer cases of one or 
another of the Asian markets. The photo specimens were purchased from a 
large Asian market in Los Angeles (168 market, Alhambra), frozen, for 
2019 US $4.56 / pound, in a 14 ounce tray, product of Vietnam.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; If there are any, they're too small to see.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; That just isn't done - there's not much in 
these fish anyway.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; You've got to be kidding. You'd need surgical 
skills and a microscope.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; 100%</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  I suppose you could just pour them into the 
stock pot and simmer for 30 minutes or so. I haven't tried it, but I 
expect it would work fine.</p>
