<h1>Atlantic Herring</h1>

[<i>Clupea harengus harengus</i>]
<p>
The most abundant and economically important herring, this fish figures 
prominently in the cuisines of Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Russia 
and the Baltic States. A round bodied fish, it can grow to nearly 18 
inches and 1.5 pounds but the photo specimen was 13-1/2 inches and 
weighed 15 ounces.</p>
<p>The photo specimen is salt pickled, heads, guts and feathers intact, 
which is how herring is normally sold - and the way most herring 
recipes expect it.  It is eaten raw in Holland, and fresh is sometimes 
specified in recipes from Northern Europe, particularly Poland, but 
fresh herring is not likely to be found here in California. Marine 
ecologists classify Atlantic herring as a sustainable harvest with 
proper fisheries management.

Herring are oily fish, which makes smoking an option. The photo specimen 
was first salt pickled, then smoked, so it was fairly salty. This 
specimen was 14-1/2 inches long and weighed 11-1/8 ounces. Smoked herring 
have a lot of tiny bones and a skin too tough to eat, and are quite 
salty, but it's all manageable. Smoked herring is also called for in 
some recipes.

<p>Many recipes I have encountered from Poland, the Baltic States and 
Russia call for "herrings" - just that, no further information. I could 
tell they were talking about a fairly large herring, but how large, why 
would I need to soak them overnight, and where could such herring be 
found?</p>
<p>Fortunately I found good shopping advice in one of my Lithuanian 
cookbooks. Unless "fresh herring" are specifically called for they are 
presumed pickled entire, "heads guts and feathers", in salt brine. You 
buy them from a barrel where they should be very tightly packed and of 
uniform size (if mixed size they are probably remnants of the catch and 
may be poor quality). The liquid in the barrel should be pale yellow, 
if dark brown the herring will be off flavor. Good quality herring has 
white flesh but it will be pink in poor quality fish. Herring that do 
not contain milt or roe are fattier and have better flavor, but some 
recipes call for using the milt and/or roe.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These fish can be found in specialty markets 
serving a community heavy in people from countries around the North 
and Baltic Seas. They are large herring, salt pickled whole and 
are in excellent condition, just as one would expect from reading the 
recipes. Jon's Marketplace in Glendale CA is now getting theirs from 
Lithuania in plastic tubs - just like the ones they used to have except 
these are gutted - which is not a problem. A number of markets here in 
Southern California now have them individually packed in plastic vacuum 
bags. The main difference is, the ones at Jon's are 2020 US $3.99 / 
pound ($2.99 when on sale), while the vacuum packed run about 
2020 US $6.00 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Both brine pickled and smoked herring have 
already been scaled.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; The body cavity is very long, like on a trout. 
Just slit it from under the head back to the vent and pull the guts out. 
With both brine pickled and smoked herring they are soft and easy to pull. 
Then cut off the head and tail. Rinse out the body cavity well.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3>  &nbsp; First make shallow cuts through the skin down 
the backside on both sides of the fin and under the tail. Peel the skin 
off. On brined herring the skin is thin and delicate. I find it best to 
start at the top about one third back and peel downward and in both 
directions. You need to get the outer skin off, but some of the silver 
or gray inner skin is likely to be left, and that's not a  problem. On 
smoked herrings the skin is tough and inedible. It peels easily.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Cut downward to the backbone as usual, and over 
the backbone at the tail end to free the fillet. At this point I often 
find it easiest to use your fingers to peel the first fillet off the 
backbone and ribs for the length of the body cavity. This will leave 
most of the fine bones attached to the backbone, but some will need to 
be pulled from the fillet. Next pull out the backbone from the tail 
forward which will take out most of the bones from the second fillet. 
<u>Note</u>: on a particularly firm fish, pulling the backbone won't 
be possible and you'll have to deal with it like a regular fish.
<p>Use your long nose pliers to pull out any remaining bones that are 
stiff enough to be worth pulling. There is also a row of pin bones that 
point upwards from the centerline. You can grab them with the pliers 
right at the surface just above the centerline. Very thin bones are 
usually not to be a problem for pickled herring, as the vinegar softens 
them.</p>

<h3>Prep Salted:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for soaking fillets in 
water or a mixture of milk and water for 12 hours or more to reduce the 
saltiness. I fillet the fish first and soak the fillets in water, 
refrigerated overnight.<p></p>
<h3>Prep Smoked:</h3> &nbsp; With long nose pliers, pull as many of the 
fine bones that you can find. Smoked herring can also be soaked for a few 
hours to reduce saltiness, but this may also affect flavor.<p></p>

<h3>Yield Salted:</h3> &nbsp; An 11-1/4 ounce fish yielded 6-3/4 ounces 
skinless fillets (60%).
<br><h3>Yield Smoked:</h3> &nbsp; A 10-3/4 ounce fish yielded 6-1/8 ounces 
skinless fillets (60%)<p></p>

very fine treat, as a snack or on buttered bread with onions.<p></p>
