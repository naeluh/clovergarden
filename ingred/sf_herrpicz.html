<h1>Herring Pickled, Kippered, Canned, Dried etc.</h1>

Herring is a small oily fish that preserves well in various ways, and all 
these ways are exploited. The photo shows a whole Atlantic Herring, salt 
pickled in brine. When Central and Northern European recipes call for 
whole herring, this is what they mean. They will usually ask you to 
soak it overnight before use to reduce the salt. See also

<h2>Pickled Herring Fillets</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_herrpkl02g.jpg" alt="Pickled Herring Fillets" class=mrg>
This photo is of a pair of pickled herring fillets from Lithuania, a 
significant producer of this sort of seafood treats since the fall of 
the Soviet Union. These were about 6-1/2 inches long and weighed about 
2-1/4 ounces each. Pickling is a very popular method of preparing herring, 
because the acid in the pickle softens the thread-like spines that are 
shot all through the flesh to the point they are undetectable.
<p>Many recipes can be found for making your own pickled herring, nearly 
all starting with the brine pickled Atlantic herring as pictured at the 
top of the page, then adding flavors and vinegar.

<h2>Kippered Herring</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_kippers03f.jpg" alt="Can of Kippered Herring Fillets" class=mrg>
Technically, kippered herring are herring that have been split open, 
salted and smoked. They are made during the spawning season when the fish 
don't taste very good without this treatment. Most Americans have never 
seen a real kippered herring but are familiar with the version that comes 
in a can, generally called "kipper snacks". Kippers are a breakfast 
staple in the British Isles and Scandianavia.

<h2>Salt Dried Herrings</h2>
<br><a href="sf_daingz.html">
<img src="img/sf_herrtun05e.jpg" alt="Small Salt Dried Herrings" class=mrg></a>
These salted and dried Tunsoy herring are much in evidence in Philippine 
markets here in Los Angeles, along with a number of other small fish 
similarly treated. For details see our 
<a href="sf_daingz.html"><b>Daing / Tuyo</b></a> page.

<h2>Canned Sardines</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_sardcanz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sardcan05d.jpg" alt="Canned Sardines" class=mrg></a>
Sardines are Herrings too, just smaller ones. They are sold dried, 
covered on our <a href="sf_daingz.html"><b>Daing / Tuyo</b></a> 
page, and are very popular worldwide when canned. For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_sardcanz.html"><b>Canned Sardines</b></a> page.

<h2 id="sustrom">Surstr&ouml;mming</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_surstz.html">
<img src="img/sf_surstrom01k.jpg" alt="Can of Surstromming" class=mrg></a>
Surstr&ouml;mming is reputed to be the most putrid stinking substance 
consumed by mankind - note that the can in the photo was opened outdoors, 
which is where it's most often eaten. A seasonal delicacy in northern 
Sweden, it's only competitor for stinkiness is said to be Japanese 
<a href="sf_pdfshdry.html#kusaya"><b>Kusaya</b></a>. Both are produced 
by fermenting fish in insufficient salt to properly preserve them. This, 
in both cases, appears to stem from ancient times when salt was very 
expensive.
<p>Baltic herring are first fermented in tubs for one or two months, then 
put up in cans - but the fermentation continues in the can, causing the 
cans to swell noticeably. Surstr&ouml;mming is normally eaten on bread 
along with potatoes and chopped red onions.</p>
<p>Surstr&ouml;mming can be mail ordered from Sweden, but I have not yet 
opened my can (12-2019), so I defer my opinion to a person with direct 
experience - see <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_surstz.html"><b>Details and
