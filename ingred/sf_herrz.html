<h1>Herring Famly</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_herra07g.jpg" alt="Pickled Atlantic Herring" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Clupeidae</i>, various genera and species]
<p>
Herring are a family of generally small oily fish of tremendous 
commercial importance worldwide. Herring can grow to over 18 inches 
and 1.5 pounds but is generally caught and harvested much smaller. 
See also <a href="sf_sardinz.html"><b>Sardines</b></a> for smaller 
varieties of Herring.</p>

[<i>Clupea harengus harengus</i>]
<p>
The most abundant and economically important herring, this round bodied 
fish can grow to nearly 18 inches and 1.5 pounds but the photo specimen 
was 13-1/2 inches and weighed 14-3/4 ounces, pickled whole. Atlantic 
herring is commonly sold pickled or smoked but is eaten raw in Holland and 
fresh in Northern Europe, particularly Poland.
<p>Whitebait are immature herrings and generally eaten whole. Sild are 
small immature herrings canned like Sardines in Norway. Marine ecologists 
classify Atlantic herring as a sustainable harvest.

<h2>American Shad</h2>

<img src="img/sf_shadam02e.jpg" alt="Whole American Shad" class=mrg></a>
[White Shad; <i>Alosa sapidissima</i>]
<p>
This is an amazingly delicious fish - for experienced fish eaters, 
as will be explained. It is native to the east coast of North America, 
from the St Lawrence river, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, south to 
central Florida, but less common south of Virginia. Some are also 
found on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Due to introduction, 
it is now also found from the south coast of Alaska to The Mexican 
Border of California, and along the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula.
<p>It can grow to 30 inches and 12 pounds, but the photo specimen, 
purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles, was 20-1/4 inches and 3 
pounds 3 ounces - still pretty big for a herring. Unfortunately, it was 
sold already scaled, so it should be more silvery. This fish is more 
closely related to European shad than to other North American shad. 
It is not considered endangered, IUCN Red Listed <b>LC</b> 
(Least Concern).

[River Anchovy (marketing); Ca Com Song (Viet); Trey bawndol ampeou 
(Khmer); <i>Corica Laciniata</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to rivers, estuaries and lagoons opening into the 
Gulf of Thailand, also in the Mekong Basin and in rivers of southern 
Borneo, Indonesia. It can grow to 2-3/4 inches, but the photo specimen
was 2.16 inches. Largest in the batch was a giant, 2.4 inches long.
<p>These fish are extremely delicate, and it was difficult for me to 
find a specimen in the tray without its belly burst open. I did not try 
to extend the pelvic fins, which you can see the tips of at the back end 
of the belly, for fear of bursting it open.

[Skipjack Shad, <i>Alosa chrysochloris</i>]
<p>
While most herring are found in cold ocean waters this one likes subtropical 
temperatures and ventures far up rivers, having been found as far north 
as Minnesota in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. This fish can grow to 
19 inches and 3-3/4 pounds the photo specimen, caught wild off Florida, 
was 9-1/2 inches and weighed 5 ounces.

[<i>Ethmalosa fimbriata</i>]
<p>
This is a very important fish in West Africa. It is found from Western 
Sahara south to northern Angola. Traditionally it was hot smoked until 
very dry for storage. Today, as ice becomes available in West Africa, it 
is becoming popular unsmoked.

<p>Herring is an oily fish that preserves well in various ways, and all 
these ways are exploited. The photo shows two pickled herring fillets 
from Lithuania, a significant exporter of such seafood treats since 
the fall of the Soviet Union. Yummm!  More on

[Kapenta, Matemba (Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe); <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika sardine) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Stolothrissa tanganicae</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika sprat)]
<p>
These fresh water herring are very important to Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. 
They originated in Lake Tanganyika, but have been successfully introduced 
into other large lakes in Southern Africa. Adults average around 4 inches 
long, and the catch us usually sun dried.

<h2 id="kilka">Kilka</h2>

<img src="img/sf_kilka06e.jpg" alt="Whole Kilka" class=mrg></a>
[Tyulka, Kilka (Russ); Black Sea Sprat, <i>Clupeonella 
cultriventris</i> - Similar: Anchovy Kilka, Anchovy Sprat 
(fishbase), <i>Clupeonella engrauliformis</i>, and (lesser importance) 
Bigeye Kilka, Southern Caspian sprat, <i>Clupeonella grimmi</i>]
<p>
<i>Cultriventris</i> is a brackish to fresh water fish native to the 
Black, Azov and northern Caspian Seas and nearby lakes and rivers, 
while <i>grimmi</i> and <i>engrauliformis</i> live in central and 
southern Caspian only. All can grow to just over  5-1/2 inches, 
<i>engrauliformis</i> a little longer, and are major fish for canning 
in the region. I have also seen some cans of Latvian Baltic sprats 
labeled Kilka, but that isn't right. The photo specimen, which was salt 
pickled, was 5 inches long and weighed 3/4 ounce. The largest in the 
batch was 6 inches and weighed 1-1/8 ounces.</p>
<p>Caspian stocks have recently dropped 50% due to an American comb jelly 
named <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> eating all their food, so the fishery is 
now endangered. This also happened to the Black Sea but another American 
jellyfish  named <i>Beroe ovata</i> came along and ate most of the 
Mnemiopsis. This solution is likely to be applied in the Caspian. 
<i>Beroe</i> eats mainly other Comb Jellies, and disappears when they 
are all eaten.

<h2>Thread Herring</h2>

[Pacific Thread Herring;  <i>Opisthonema libertate</i> &nbsp; - 
&nbsp; Atlantic Thread Herring; <i>Opisthonema oglinum</i>]
<p>
These fish are named for the last ray of the dorsal fin which reach 
near the end of the tail. Unfortunately this thread doesn't survive 
freezing and handling, so there is only a short stub on market fish.
The Pacific species is found from San Pedro (Los Angeles) California 
south to Peru, but is rare on the outer coast of Baja California.
The Atlantic species is found from Maine through the Caribbean and 
Gulf of Mexico to northern Brazil. The Pacific can grow to nearly 
12 inches, but the photo specimen, purchased from a Philippine 
market in Los Angeles, was 10 inches long and weighed 5-1/4 ounces. 
The Atlantic can grow about an inch longer.

<p>
These three fish are all but indistinguishable one from another. They 
are highly commercial Indo-West Pacific fish found from the Persian 
Gulf to the South China Sea and the Java Sea, these fish can grow to 
over 23 inches inches (14 inches for kelee) but the Hilsa specimen in 
the photo was 10 inches and weighed 6 ounces. These shad are marketed 
fresh and dried and are not considered threatened. Farming Ilish / 
Hilsa is in the development stages in India (2012 - 2014). This is 
considered a very desirable fish in West Bengal and Bangladesh, 
and is the national fish of Bangladesh.

<p>
Tunsoy is the Philippine name for various Indo-Pacific herring. The 
photo specimen, from a package of salted and dried herring obtained 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, was rehydrated by soaking 
in water for 20 hours (yes it took that long to soften it up). It 
was 4-3/4 inches long and weighed 0.35 ounce rehydrated. This fish 
was eviscerated before drying in compliance with California health 
law. &nbsp; <a href="sf_tunsoyz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.
