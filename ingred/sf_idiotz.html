<h1>Idiot Fish</h1>

[Shortspine Thornyhead (fishbase), <i>Sebastolobus alascanus</i>]
<p>
This is a variety of Scorpion Fish particularly adapted to the deep 
"oxygen minimum" layer of the ocean where most fish can not thrive. It 
has a huge head, both long and wide, housing very large gills. It lives 
in the North Pacific, some as far south as the Mexican border but mostly 
Northern California, Washington State, Canada and Russia, as far south as 
northern Japan. This fish can grow to 31 inches and 20 pounds but the 
photo specimen was 21 inches and 4-3/4 pounds, towards the large end of 
market size.</p>
<p>Living under very sub-optimal conditions the Idiot Fish grows slowly 
and has a slow propagation rate. The U.S. fishery is tightly regulated 
under Federal fisheries programs to avoid overfishing, consequently it's 
not found far from the Pacific coast. Of course it's strange spiny 
appearance is sort of off-putting for many people anyway, which is just 
as it should be because there will be more for me.  Outside the U.S. 
Pacific coast regulation may be deficient and the IUCN Red List status 
is EN (Endangered) due to its slow propagation.</p>

<p>Idiot flesh is very tender and very white, with a fairly thick darker 
layer under the skin. The darker layer does not have a strong flavor but 
it is different in texture - being a bit gelatinous it does not flake at 
all. This would help hold chunks together if used in soup. The rest of 
the flesh is also slightly gelatinous and breaks apart as much as it 
flakes. All in all, Idiot has a subtle but interesting flavor, 
particularly when poached, and is sweeter than other rockfish.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Idiot Fish can often be found in Asian markets 
in Los Angeles, though I don't remember seeing it in those that serve a 
primarily Philippine community. It is a premium fish, selling for 2014 
US $4.69 and higher for whole fish.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Idiot Fish is covered with small thin scales 
that scrape off easily and do not fly about at all.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There's a lot of stuff inside one of these, and 
up at the head end it won't pull so you need to cut it off with kitchen 
shears. The gills are huge, have prickly gill rakers and are strongly 
attached. You'll need to cut them out with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The Idiot Fish is fairly easy to fillet, though its 
limpness does cause a little trouble. First cut off the head, turing the 
knife steeply under the gill covers to get the maximum amount of flesh. 
When I get to the ribcage I cut the 
ribs loose from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the 
fillet with long nose pliers. There are a few substantial centerline 
spines up near the front of the fish that need to be pulled. 

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is moderate due to the huge head and heavy 
bones. A 4-3/4 pound fish yielded 1 pound 11-3/8 ounces of skin-on 
fillets (36%) and 1 pound 9-7/8 ounces skin-off (34%). There will still be 
a lot of flesh on the carcass, particularly the collar, which can not be 
removed except after a short simmer.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The Idiot Fish's skin shrinks severely when cooked 
so it should be removed for any method of cooking. It is very thin but tough 
and fairly easy to remove using the standard long knife and cutting board 
method. Very little flesh should be lost.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Due to the huge head and severe skin shrink this 
fish is not suitable for cooking whole. Fillets can be pan fried or 
poached and hold together very well. Like other rockfish, Idiot will curl 
a bit to the skin side, even though the skin has been removed. When 
poaching it is best to cut the fillet in half lengthwise so the pieces are 
long rather than wide. This is a good fish for cutting into chunks for fish 
soup as the chunks will hold together well.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a medium flavored fish 
stock suitable for soups and stews, and because the head is huge and fleshy 
it will make quite a bit of stock. The stock does have a fair amount of 
oil which needs to be separated out - use your gravy separator. When you 
start making stock make sure you have plenty of water and bring to a boil 
uncovered. A large amount of slime and foam will rise to the surface as 
it comes to a boil - remove it with a skimmer.</p>
