<h1>Japanese Amberjack / Hamachi</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_jackja02g.jpg" alt="Whole Japanese Amberjack" class=mrg>
[<i>Seriola quinqueradiata</i> | similar: Yellowtail Amberjack; 
<i>Seriola lalandi</i>]
<p>
The Japanese Amberjack is called <i>Hamachi</i> when it has grown to 
about 6 pounds, and <i>Buri</i> when it has reached 10 pounds, but it 
can grow to about 5 feet and 80 pounds. The photo specimen was 19 inches 
long and weighed 3 pounds 2 ounces. This fish is most common along 
the coasts of Japan and Korea, but is sometimes found as far east as 
Hawaii and Baja California, Mexico. It is very popular in Japan, eaten 
both raw and cooked particularly in winter when it is fattier. It is 
now extensively farmed, but this is done done by capturing juveniles in 
the wild, not an ecologically ideal method.</p>

<p>This fish is very like the <a href="sf_jackytz.html">
<b>Yellowtail Amberjack</b></a> but doesn't grow as large and has a much 
more restricted range. They can usually be told apart by coloration, 
but definitively, the upper jaw of the Japanese is very squared off 
right under the eye, whereas on Yellowtail it is more rounded.</p>

<p>Flesh of this fish is medium in color, with a deep strip of very 
dark meat down the centerline, but this dark meat doesn't differ 
greatly from the lighter flesh in taste or oiliness. It's not a fish 
for those who want "fish lite", but is highly prized by those who 
actually like fish.</p>
<p>While raw <i>Hamachi</i> is very popular in sushi bars, it is also 
very fine cooked. The flesh becomes quite firm when baked, steamed 
or poached, but is easily broken into large flakes. It holds together 
well enough for fish stews. </p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found these in Philippine and Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, California. In season they can be quite 
economical. I bought the photo specimen, and a couple more, for 
US $1.99/pound. These markets also often have California Yellowtail 
Amberjacks, which are pretty much interchangeable with the Japanese, 
except a whole lot larger.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; These are tiny and easy to scrape off with only 
moderate flying around.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; The main problem here is size. There are 
a lot of membranes and such that are not easy to pull out without 
using your long nose pliers. Be sure to scrape through the long swim 
bladder and scrape off the blood works above it. Use kitchen shears 
to cut both ends of the gills to make them easier to pull out.<p></p> 

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is very easy to fillet. When you 
get down to the rib cage don't bother trying to follow the bones with 
your knife. Just use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone 
and pull them from the fillets with your long nose pliers. They pull 
easily and take almost no flesh. The skirt is thick and meaty on these 
fish.
<p>There are substantial centerline spines for the front half of the 
fish. They are easy to find - just pull them out straight forward.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 3 pound 2 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 13-3/8 
ounces of skin-on fillet (59%) and 1 pound 10-1/2 ounces skin-off (53%).
This fish can be used skin on.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has very little shrink when fried or 
poached. The flavor is a little oilier than that of the flesh, but not 
unpleasantly so. Cubes cut for stew can be left skin-on. For Baking or 
steaming a full fillet, you should make a few diagonal cuts just through 
the skin for better appearance. Skinning fillets is quite easy, but for 
so large a fish it is best to split them along the centerline, even if 
your knife is long enough for the full width.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a very 
serviceable nearly clear stock of medium flavor. There is a fair 
amount of oil which should be removed before us (use your gravy 
separator). For details see our
