[Jackfish <i>Caranx  caninus</i> (Pacific) <i>Caranx hippos</i> 
(Atlantic)]
<p>
The Pacific and Atlantic fish may actually be the same species. The 
Pacific, is found from Southern California to Peru and may grow to 
almost 40 inches and almost 40 pounds but the photo specimen was 11 
inches and 11 ounces. Atlantic fish are found from Nova Scotia to Uruguay 
and have grown to over 48 inches and 70 pounds.</p>

<p>This is a "dark meat, almost mackerel strength" fish, so it will not 
be thought ideal by neophytes who want their fish white and pale in 
flavor.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish is not a good candidate for cooking 
whole because of the severe skin shrink. As with other Jacks, the flesh 
stays quite firm, even with wet cooking, but is easily broken into large 
flakes.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Crevalle Jack scales are small and easy to 
scrape off, and there aren't many of them.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish fillets easily with a coherent bones 
structure to follow. When you get to the rib cage, cut the ribs from 
the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with 
long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has shrinks so severely it will actually 
tear fillets, so it needs to be removed for any method of cooking. The 
standard long knife and cutting board method works fine. The bothersome 
row of hard scutes along the lateral line come off with the skin.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A  9 ounce fish yielded about 4 ounces of 
bone-free skinless fillet (44%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; No recent test available, but will probably be 
a bit a little strong.</p>
