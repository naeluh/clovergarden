<p>
The Yellowtail Amberjack has a worldwide distribution along the coasts 
extending from north subarctic to south subarctic but preferring warmer 
waters. It can grow to nearly 8-1/4 feet long and 213 pounds but is more 
commonly a little less than 3 feet long. The photo specimen was 27 
inches and 7.44 pounds. It is a prized sports fish and there is a small 
commercial catch, mainly to supply sushi bars with "hamachi" and 
yellow tail collar.</p>

<p>While this fish is currently fairly plentiful, it is becoming 
somewhat depleted along the California coast due to fishing ships 
from Japan. Farming is being considered, but unlike the 
<a href="sf_jackjaz.html">Japanese Amberjack</a>, juveniles can't 
be easily captured in the wild. Establishing a captive breeding 
operation will be required.</p>

<p>This is a medium and dark meat fish with a distinct but pleasant 
flavor. It's not a fish for those who want "fish lite", but is highly 
thought of by people who actually like fish. The dark strip down the 
center runs quite deep, but it does not differ greatly in flavor or 
oiliness from the lighter flesh. The flesh becomes quite firm when 
baked, steamed or poached, but is easily broken into large flakes. It 
holds together well enough for fish stews.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I find these in Philippine and Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, California. In season they can be quite economical. 
These markets sometimes have Japanese Amberjacks (Hamachi), which are 
pretty much interchangeable with the Yellowtail.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; These are tiny and easy to scrape off with only 
moderate flying around.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; The main problem here is size. There are 
a lot of membranes and such that are not easy to pull out without 
using your long nose pliers. Be sure to scrape through the long swim 
bladder and scrape off the blood works above it. Use kitchen shears 
to cut both ends of the gills to make them easier to pull out.<p></p> 

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is very easy to fillet. When you 
get down to the rib cage don't bother trying to follow the bones with 
your knife. Just use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone 
and pull them from the fillets with your long nose pliers. They pull 
easily and take almost no flesh. The skirt is thick and meaty on these 
fish.
<p>There are substantial centerline spines for the front half of the 
fish. They are easy to find - just pull them out straight forward.</p>

<p>Of course, right behind the head is the famous "yellowtail collar" 
which is oiled and broiled and sold at a high price in sushi bars. This 
can be a special treat for the cook.<p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The 7.44 pound fish in the photo yielded 4.3 
pounds of skin-on fillet (58%). 4.0 pounds skin-off (54%).<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has very little shrink when fried or 
poached. The flavor is a little oilier than that of the flesh, but not 
unpleasantly so. Cubes cut for stew can be left skin-on if you wish. 
Skinning fillets is quite easy, but for so large a fish it is best to 
split them along the centerline, even if you knife is long enough for 
the full width.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a stock that is  
quite clear, with medium flavor, excellent for soups and stews. 
There is a fair amount of oil which needs to be removed (use your 
gravy separator). For details see our
