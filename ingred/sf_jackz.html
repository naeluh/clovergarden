<p>[family <i>Carangidae</i>, Genus <i>Caranx</i>, various species &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
  Genus <i>Seriola</i> (amberjacks) &nbsp; | &nbsp; others]
</p><p>
Common names within family <i>Carangidae</i> are very disorderly, including 
Jacks, Amberjacks, Pompanos, Trevally and Scads, without clear differentiation 
as to which are which. This page deals with those most commonly called 
Jacks and Trevally, which tend to be some of the larger of the 
<i>Carangidae</i>, without too much regard to what genus they belong to. 
With 30 genera, the naming mess is impossible to make orderly. For other 
fish in this family see

<a href="sf_scadz.html">Scad</a> and

and from Nova Scotia, Canada, to northern Brazil, including 
the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. They can grow to nearly 28 inches

<h2>Yellowtail Horse Mackerel</h2> - [<i>Trachurus novaezelandiae</i>]

[<i>Trachurus declivis</i>]
<br><img src="img/sf_ytmac04e.jpg" alt="Yellowtail Mackerel" class=mrg>
<p>These two very similar fish are found around New Zealand and southern 
Australia. The far more numerous Yellowtail is often confused with 
the related Yellowtail Scad. It is more slender, the fins are slightly 
different, and the row of scutes turns more steeply upward. For prep 
and cooking, our 
<a href="sf_scadytz.html"><b>Yellowtail Scad</b></a> page should 
work fine.
