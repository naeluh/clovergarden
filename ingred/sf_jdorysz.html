<h1>Silvery John Dory</h1>

[Sailfin Dory; <i>Zenopsis conchifer</i>]
<p>
This fish is not the famous John Dory of European cuisine, though 
looks a lot like it except for color. Silvery John Dory is native to 
both sides of the Atlantic, from sub-Arctic down to Argentina and 
South Africa. It is also found in the Indian Ocean from South Africa 
around to Indonesia and northwest Australia. It is not found in the 
Pacific at all. This fish can grow to 31-1/2 inches long and 7 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 21 inches long and 3-1/2 pounds, a typical 
size. Silvery John Dory is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated) but is 
not considered threatened. It has no scales, so is not kosher.</p>
<p>Silvery John Dory is not a good swimmer and catches it's prey by 
sneaking up on it. It then suddenly extends its mouth into a long 
tunnel and sucks the pray in. It is distinguished by a row of hard 
bony scutes along the bottom edge for the full length of the body 
cavity, and hard bony bucklers, each with a thorn on it, for the 
full length of the bases of the dorsal and anal fins.</p>

<p>The flesh of skinless fillets is white and cooks well for both 
wet and dry cooking methods. It is firm enough for poaching and flakes 
apart easily on the plate. The taste is, however, rather bland, so I 
don't recommend poaching. Dusting it with rice flour and pan frying in 
pure or pomace olive oil until light blonde in color gives it enough 
flavor to be enjoyable.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is hardly ever seen in the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, probably because it is not found in the 
Pacific Ocean at all. The photo specimen was purchased at a Philippine 
market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2016 US $1.99 per pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish has no scales at all. It does have 
hard bony scutes along the bottom edge for the full length of the body 
cavity , and hard bony bucklers along the bases of the dorsal and anal 
fins, but these don't count for being kosher because they can't be 
scraped off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; To clean this fish, I cut in from both sides 
of the row of scutes and pull them off. This completely opens the body 
cavity. The cavity is large and filled with a lot of messy stuff. The 
throat is very large and needs to be cut off with kitchen shears. Then 
cut away the head. I do not pull the gills because the head is of no 
use. With the head off it is easy to finish cleaning up the body 
cavity.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The main impediment for filleting is the rows 
of bony bucklers. I cut under them from both sides with my filleting 
knife, from the side opposite the fin. I then bend them outward and 
cut off the bucklers and fins with strong kitchen shears. At this 
point, the fish is easy to fillet, as there are good fin rays and 
bones to follow. When I cut forward to the body cavity, I cut it from 
the backbone with kitchen shears. The fillet skirts have lines like 
they have ribs, but there are no ribs in them. There are some sharp 
centerline pinbones to be located and pulled for the length of the 
body cavity.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has an oily taste stronger than the 
flesh, and considerable shrink if fried. Even if you don't mind the 
taste, you need to skin fillets, because the skin immediately turns 
to mush and sticks to the pan and your turner, even when powdered 
with rice flour.</p>
<p>Fillets can be skinned rather easily using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but with a few 
preparation steps. First, make a diagonal cut taking off the entire 
skirt. The flesh in this region has no integrity and simply turns to 
mush when skinned. Second, you are going to end up with three fillets 
from one, whether you want to or not, so you might as well make skinning 
easy by separating them now. There is a seam that opens all the way 
through to the skin between the main fillet and the big triangle left 
from cutting off the skirt. There is another for the full length of the 
main fillet, dividing it into a wider upper fillet and a narrower lower 
fillet. Spread these seams and cut through the skin to separate them 
before skinning.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3-1/2 pound fish yielded 1 pound skin-off 
fillet (29%), a low yield because of losing the skirt area. It would 
be 42% skin-on and skirt on, but a skin-on fillet is of no use.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins make a very muddy 
looking stock. I didn't bother tasting it because it was visually 
unacceptable.</p>
