[Kapenta, Matemba (Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe); <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika sardine) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Stolothrissa tanganicae</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika sprat)]
<p>
These fish both originated in Lake Tanganyika, but have been introduced to 
other lakes in Southern Africa. They are an important human food in Zambia, 
Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Forming large schools in open waters, they feed on 
plankton, but come close to shore during breeding season. They are caught 
at night using lights and large dip nets. They are then sun dried on 
screens.</p>

<p>Adult <i>L. miodon</i> average around 4 inches (10 cm) long and adult 
<i>S. tanganicae</i> average about 2-3/4 inches (7 cm).  While still plentiful, 
there is concern of depletion from overfishing, so some countries have banned 
fishing for them close to shore during the breeding season and now require 
licensing. IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; For fresh, you have to be there, but nearly all these 
fish are sun dried. This can be a problem as they are most available in the 
rainy season. The photo specimens were dried with light salt. Since the largest 
in the batch were 1.85 inches (4.70 cm) I presume these were  
<i>S. tanganicae</i>. Fresh are sold near where they are caught. Dried are 
often available on-line in North America from Zim Tuckshop, a Zimbabwe grocery 
specialist. The photo specimens cost 2022 US $1.00 / ounce at 7 ounces weight 
(200 gms).<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The most popular way to use these dried fish is to 
fry them in some oil, then stew them with onions, tomatoes and curry powder. 
They may also be lightly battered and deep fried as a snack. Fresh ones can 
be pan fried with onions, herbs and spices, or lightly battered and deep 
fried.
