[C&aacute; K&egrave;o (Viet): Spiny Goby (market); <i>Pseudapocryptes 
elongatus</i> alt <i>P. lanceolatus</i>]
<p>
This air breathing vegetarian fish, a species of Goby, is found 
from India to Tahiti and north to China. It lives only in brackish waters, 
particularly in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. It can grow to nearly 8 
inches but the photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches and weighed 0.77 ounces. 
It was harvested wild in Vietnam where this fish is quite popular for 
a hot-pot soup named after it.</p>

This fish is generally eaten whole. It may be grilled or fried but is 
more often used in a hotpot soup called <i>Lau C&aacute; K&egrave;o</i>, 
after the fish. This soup requires two essential herbs for the broth, 
<i>la giang</i> (lit. "river leaf"; <i>Aganonerion polymorphum</i> - 
sour) and <i>rau dang</i> (<i>Glinus oppositifolius</i> - bitter). Rau 
Dang is now available in Asian markets here  in Los Angeles, but La 
Giang has apparently not yet received approval. The State of California 
is suspicious of possibly irrigation clogging water weeds. Other states 
have a similar attitude.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, many restaurants keep the fish alive (not difficult since 
they can breath air when they need to). When a customer orders Ca Keo soup 
it is brought to a boil, then the fish are put in live (to prove they're 
fresh), and the soup is eaten when it comes back to a boil. Live fish are 
not obtainable here because the State of California takes a very dim view 
of non-native air breathing fish that are impossible to exterminate once 
established in our waterways, as do Florida, Hawaii and other states.</p>

<p>Fried plain and eaten with a dip (a mix of fish sauce and tamarind 
called <a href="../recipes/sjf_nuocmme1.html">Nuoc Mam Me</a> is often used 
in Vietnam) it's served as an appetizer (photo at left - deep fried with a 
light coating of salted sweet potato starch). The body cavity is mostly 
filled with fat, which sort of disappears during frying but leaves a strong 
slightly bitter taste which I don't really care for, so I clean the fish before 
frying. A Vietnamese ca keo eater might protest that I'm throwing away the 
best part, but even some Vietnamese admit the bitter taste was a bit 
off-putting until they got used to it.</p> 

<p>On first encounter, what I didn't like about this fish was that it has 
a fair number of prickly parts which make eating it less pleasant 
than it might be. The worst of these can be avoided by removing the 
head with a cut behind the fins, but there are a few others.</p>

<p>Then I developed a way to make this fish into an enjoyable appetizer. 
It's a little messy, but, hey, this is an appetizer for guys and beer, 
not society ladies. You will need paper napkins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash the fish to remove slime, using one of those orange peel based 
  cleaners like The Big Orange or Natural Orange.</li> 
<li>Cut off the heads, taking the pectoral and pelvic fins with them.</li>
<li>Split the belly (fillet knife in from the front with sharp edge up) 
  and clean it out.</li>
<li>Dust with salted rice flour, sweet potato starch, or similar. Deep 
  fry 6 or so at a time until well crisped on the outside.</li>
<li>Let cool until the insides are easy to handle. Serve with dip 
  of your choice.</li>
<li>Pick up a fish and use your thumbnails to split the belly all the 
  way to the tail and down to the backbone.  Spread the sides and pull 
  out the backbone. If the fish is reasonably cool it will come out 
  taking almost no flesh.</li>
<li>You now have a fish without the pricklys - ready for the 
  dip of your choice. Eat the crispy tail too.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; These can be found in Asian markets serving 
a Southeast Asian community, generally packed in foam trays in the frozen 
food section, but sometimes on ice in the fish section.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Not done in Vietnam - but easily accomplished 
(see notes above). There are no detectable scales on this fish. It's up to 
you whether you remove the head or not. If you do, cut on a diagonal from 
just behind the head at the top, and behind both the pectoral and pelvic 
fins at the bottom.</p>
