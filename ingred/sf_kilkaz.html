[Kilka, Tyulka (Russ); Black Sea Sprat, <i>Clupeonella cultriventris</i> - 
Similar:  Anchovy Kilka, Anchovy Sprat (fb), <i>Clupeonella 
engrauliformis</i> and (lesser importance) Bigeye Kilka, Southern 
Caspian sprat, <i>Clupeonella grimmi</i>]
<p>
A member of the Herring family (<i>Clupeidae</i>), <i>cultriventris</i> 
is a brackish to fresh water fish native to the Black, Azov and 
northern Caspian Seas and nearby lakes and rivers, while <i>grimmi</i> 
and <i>engrauliformis</i> live in central and southern Caspian only. 
All can grow to just over  5-1/2 inches, <i>engrauliformis</i> a 
little longer, and are major fish for canning in the region. I have 
also seen some cans of Latvian Baltic sprats labeled Kilka, but that 
isn't right. The photo specimen, which was salt pickled, was 5 inches 
long and weighed 3/4 ounce. The largest in the batch was 6 inches and 
weighed 1-1/8 ounces.</p>
<p>Caspian stocks have recently dropped 50% due to an American comb jelly 
named <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> eating all their food and the fishery is now 
endangered. This also happened to the Black Sea but another American 
jellyfish  named <i>Beroe ovata</i> came allong and ate most of the 
Mnemiopsis. This solution is likely to be applied in the Caspian. 
<i>Beroe</i> eats only <i>Mnemiopsis</i> and disappears when they are 
all eaten.</p>

<h3>Canned Kilka:</h3> &nbsp; Kilka is mostly canned in oil or tomato 
sauce or smoked and canned in oil. The major exporter is Iran, so you 
aren't likely to see much of it in the U.S. until the current sword 
rattling is a thing of the past.

<p>Meanwhile some Latvian Baltic sprats are roasted and made up in tomato 
sauce, and even labeled "Kilka". I've had them and they're quite edible. 
Of course the bulk of sprats are smoked and canned in oil. These fish 
are so closely related substitution is not a problem.</p>

<h3>Salt Pickled Kilka:</h3> &nbsp; This form is available in some 
markets serving a Russian community - the photo specimen came from Jon's 
Marketplace in Glendale CA. Salt pickled kilka are much like salt 
pickled herring, just nearly an ounce, rather than nearly a pound.
<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Like herring, salt pickled Kilka should be 
soaked in water for some hours before eating or using in a recipe 
to cut salt content. 6 hours should be fine, even less if you reduce 
it to fillets.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; 1-1/4 pound yielded 11-1/4 ounces of fillet 
(55%).

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; You may wish to fillet this fish rather than 
eat it "head guts and feathers", especially for use in recipes  This is 
easier than you might think. When doing this procedure it is fastest to 
do one step on all the fish before going to the next step. I do the 
filleting before soaking to reduce salt.

<ol>
<li>Pull the fin out of the back.</li>
<li>Cut off the tail.</li>
<li>Behind the head cut downwards 2/3 of the way, then pull the head away 
from the body. It will take some of the guts with it.</li>
<li>Take your filleting knife and  insert it into the body cavity from the 
head end, all the way to the tail end and cut outward. This will open the 
body and tear the hard keel loose.</li>
<li>Rinse out the body cavity, removing any remaining guts and any parts 
of the hard keel that remain attached.</li>
<li>Set the fish on its back. Holding down the flesh on both sides of the 
backbone, pull the backbone up, working from front to the back.</li>
</ol>
