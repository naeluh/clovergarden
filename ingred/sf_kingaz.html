[Kingfish; <i>Scomberomorus cavalla</i>]
<p>
Largest of the fish called mackerel, this Spanish Mackerel can weigh 
nearly 100 pounds, measure up to 6 feet long and live for over 20 
years. It is found along the Atlantic coast of the Americas from 
the U.S. / Canada boarder almost to Argentina. Sports fishing brings 
in well over twice the catch of commercial fishing. The photo specimen 
weighed about 13 pounds.

<p><b>Prep &amp; Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This being an Atlantic fish, and 
mostly caught in sport fishing, I have no direct experience with it. On 
the other hand, the larger members of the Spanish Mackerel tribe are 
quite close in characteristics, so our <a href="sf_sierraz.html"><b>
Pacific Sierra</b></a> page should be quite relevant to this fish - 
it even has a wavy lateral line like the Kingfish.</p>

<p>If you are from India, both the Atlantic King Mackerel and the 
Pacific Sierra should make fine substitutes for 
<a href="sf_surmaiz.html"><b>Seerfish</b></a>, also a Spanish 
Mackerel.</p>
