[<i>Synodus scituliceps</i>]
<p>
Native to the eastern Pacific from the southern tip of Baja California 
to Chile and the Galapagos Islands, this lizardfish is not famous like 
the Bombay Duck, but does occasionally show up in Asian Markets here in 
Los Angeles, at least at 168 Market. Many of its characteristics are 
quite similar to the Duck, but handling is a bit different. 
My identification of the photo specimen as <i>S. scituliceps</i> is not 
certain, but the best match I could find. <i>Saurida tumbil</i> is 
similar but its pectoral fins attach high againsr the lateral line. 
This fish was 10-5/8 inches long and weighed 3-1/2 ounces, 2014 US 
$1.99 / pound.</p>

<p>Pan fried with a powdering of rice flour, and eaten with my standard 
lemon, white wine and butter sauce, this fish was surprisingly 
delectable, with a light, non-fishy flavor. Preparation was a bit tedious 
though.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Any wet method of cooking will turn this fish 
into mush - it's almost mush to start with. It can be lightly powdered 
with rice flour (a little heavier on the skin side to prevent sticking) 
and pan fried until very lightly browned.
</p>
 
<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I have purchased this fish from 168 Market on 
Valley Blvd. in Alhambra CA (LA county) - they have had it multiple 
times, but it's not a regular item.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Unlike the Bombay Duck, this is completely 
covered with tiny scales with moderate adhesion. The main problem scaling 
this fish is that it is so limp. Start by scaling the top, then go to the 
bottom, because the belly is likely to break open and be messy. If you 
find a few more scales during preparation, you can easily remove them
with a thumbnail.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is very thin and has almost no shrink 
at all in cooking. Don't try to remove it, it's what's holding the 
fillets together.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning and Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This fish is easy to clean and 
fillet, but it's done a bit different from most fish, more like you would 
prepare a Bombay duck. The main differences are that this fish must be 
scaled, and the backbone is better calcified (harder). for more details 
see our <a href="sf_lizshx.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>
<ol>
<li>Scale the fish (see note above).</li>
<li>Cut the head off diagonally passing just aft of the pectoral 
  fins.</li>
<li>Cut off the tail.</li>
<li>Cut off the strange little platform the pelvic (bottom) fins are 
  attached to</li>
<li>Slit the belly all the way back to the tail. Insert you fillet 
  knife into the body cavity sharp edge out and cut outward.</li>
<li>Pull out all the innards. There isn't much, unless there's a large 
  fish being digested inside. Scrape off the dark blood works on the 
  backbone. Unlike the Duck, the backbone will now be fully exposed and 
  the fillet will open out flat.</li>
<li>Find the anal fin near the tail, it will be on one side of the fillet, 
  and cut it away. There is also a tiny fin on the dorsal side just in 
  front of the tail. You can grab hold of that and just pull it out, if 
  you want to bother.</li>
<li>Make a shallow "V" cut from each side of the backbone so you can 
  get under it and cut it out.</li>
<li>Set the fillet skin side up and make a cut on each side of the dorsal 
  fin. Pull it out.</li>
<li>Trim off any skin-thin areas along the edges.</li>
<li>Rinse the fillets and drain.</li>
<li>Roll the fillets back up skin side out and gently wring out excess 
  water. This is not as effective as with the Duck.</li> 
</ol>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Pretty good, actually. A batch of 10 fish weighing 
1 pound 12 ounces yielded 14-7/8 ounces of trimmed fillets (52%), 
after wringing out excess water.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; You've got to be kidding - you'll end up with a 
pot of slime.</p>
