<h1>Lizardfish Family</h1>

[family <i>Synodontidae</i>]
<p>
These rather strange fish are voracious predators, sometimes swallowing 
fish 2/3 their own length. Their large mouths have multiple rows of needle 
sharp teeth, and they even have rows of needle teeth on their tongues. 
They are mainly ambush predators. Their flesh is strangely soft, almost 
gelatinous, and their bones are incompletely calcified. The most famous 
is the Bombay Duck, very popular in India, Southern China and Vietnam, 
both fresh and dried.

<h2>Shorthead Lizardfish</h2>

[<i>Synodus scituliceps</i>]<p>
Native to the eastern Pacific from the southern tip of Baja California 
to Chile and the Galapagos Islands, this lizardfish is not famous like 
the Bombay Duck, but does occasionally show up in Asian Markets here in 
Los Angeles, at least at 168 Market. Many of its characteristics are 
quite similar to the Duck, but handling is a bit different. 
My identification of the photo specimen as <i>S. scituliceps</i> is not 
certain, but the best match I could find. <i>Saurida tumbil</i> is 
similar but its pectoral fins attach high against the lateral line. 
This fish was 10-5/8 inches long and weighed 3-1/2 ounces, 2014 US 
$1.99 / pound.

<h2>Bumalo / Bombay Duck</h2>

[Bummalow, Bombil, Bumla (India); Lutia (Bengal); Loitta 
(Bangladesh); Luli (Malay); Latia, Kh&ocirc; c&aacute; Khoai 
(Vietnam); Long tou yu (China); <i>Harpadon nehereus</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish is native to the Gulf of Arabia, around India 
and through Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. It shares many 
characteristics of fish living at great depth: gaping jaw with many needle 
sharp teeth, translucent, almost gelatinous flesh, uncalcified bones and 
nighttime phosphorescence, so it may be a deep benthic fish that returned 
to shallower waters. It does, in fact, have deep sea relatives in family 
<i>Bathysauridae</i>. this fish inhabits moderate depth water along the 
coasts and sometimes enters estuaries. This fish is currently abundant, 
IUCN NE (Not Evaluated).</p>
<p>This fish is considered a delicacy, particularly in India and parts of 
southeastern China. Bumalo can grow to 16 inches but are commonly 10 
inches or less. The photo specimen was 11-1/4 inches long and weighed 
5-1/8 ounces, but at least 1/2 ounce of that was two tiny squid and a 
small fish it had just swallowed, which is why this one looks a little 
pot bellied.</p>
<p>Salted and sun dried, this fish is called "Bombay Duck". Origin of 
that name is uncertain, but usually associated with the rank smell of 
cars in the Bombay mail train (Bombay Daak) during monsoon season. 
Unfortunately that can't be true, the name predates the railroad.
