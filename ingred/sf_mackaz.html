[Norwegian Mackerel; Saba (Japan); <i>Scomber scombrus</i>]
<p>
This North Atlantic mackerel is most commonly found off the European 
coast and in Japanese sushi bars  - large quantities are exported 
to Japan from Norway. There are also strong populations off the U.S. 
Atlantic coast and it is also found in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea 
and off the coast of Morocco. This fish can grow to 23-1/2 inches, but 
the photo specimen was 15 inches long and weighed 1-1/4 pounds before 
being cleaned, stuffed and baked. This fish is kosher, though I'm not 
certain how.</p>

<p>In California sushi bars Atlantic mackerel is often called "Saba" 
or "Japanese Mackerel" and served lightly pickled in a style the 
Japanese picked up from the Portuguese a few hundred years ago. 
Other mackerel, including Japanese mackerel, are also served as "Saba", 
depending on what's available.</p>

<p>Atlantic mackerel is used in many European and some American recipes 
for stuffing and baking. It is also often pickled or smoked commercially, 
and also sold canned.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Mackerel is not often found in American fish 
markets, except canned, pickled or smoked. It is not a popular fish with 
Americans, but is extremely popular in most of the rest of the world. It 
can usually be found in Asian fish markets. I get it from one or another 
of the Philippine markets here in Los Angeles, usually for about 
2016 US $1.99 / pound. If they don't have Atlantic mackerel, they 
usually have another variety that will work (see 
<a href="sf_mackz.html"><b>Mackerel Family</b></a>).</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Supposedly mackerels have enough scales to be 
kosher. Perhaps you have to be a hungry rabbi with sharp eyes to find 
them, because I never have.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There is nothing unusual about cleaning a 
mackerel, except <u>the flesh is extremely tender</u> so handle gently. 
Break through the membrane at the top of the body cavity to scrape out 
the blood works just below the backbone. For stuffing, the backbone is 
often cut at the head and tail end and pulled out with all the ribs. 
This is very easy as the bones practically fall out of the flesh. Photo 
instructions will be found on our recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/gmf_mackstuff1.html">Stuffed Mackerel</a></p>

<p><b>Filleting</b> &nbsp; This is very easy, but again, the flesh is 
<u>extremely tender</u> so handle gently and do not bend it sharply. 
At the rib cage just cut the ribs off the backbone with your kitchen 
shears and pull them from the fillet - they practically fall out. There 
are centerline pinbones for almost full length of the fish, but they are 
extremely easy to find and pull out - but go deep with the points of 
your long nose pliers. The top end breaks off easily leaving most of 
the bone still in the flesh.</p> 

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 15 inch 1 pound 1-1/2 ounce fish yielded 
10-1/2 ounces of skin-on fillet (60%), an excellent yield.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Don't even try to skin this fish. The skin may be 
tender, but it's all that's holding the fillet together. It has little 
shrink in cooking and does not have a strong or "off" flavor.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Atlantic mackerel is considered too oily and too 
strong in taste to make a usable fish stock.</p>

<p><b>Health &amp; Nutrition:</b> &nbsp; This fish is very high in 
Omega-3 fish oils, and it is not a mercury problem. Certain supplement 
peddlers shrilly declare <u>all</u> fish to be mercury problems despite 
strong evidence to the contrary. After all, how could they sell their 
expensive krill oil if you knew you could just go out and buy a mackerel?
</p>

<p>Mackerel is delicate and perishable. It should be bought fresh or 
frozen, kept well refrigerated and cooked promptly. If mishandled it 
could be subject to bacterial action resulting in production of 
histamines. An overload of histamines causes tingling of the lips and 
mouth, skin rashes, vomiting and other symptoms that may last for as 
long as 12 hours. In most cases it is not dangerous, but in the case 
of persons with allergy to bee and wasp stings it can be serious. Such 
persons should be careful about the fish they eat and should carry 
anti-histamine tablets.</p>
