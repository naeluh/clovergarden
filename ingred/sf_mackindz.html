[Alumahan (Philippine); <i>Rastrelliger kanagurta</i>]
<p>
This is a highly commercial Indo-West Pacific mackerel found from the 
Red Sea and Madagascar to Samoa, these fish can grow to over 13 inches, 
but photo specimen was 9 inches and weighed 5-1/4 ounces. This fish 
is not considered threatened and is sold fresh, frozen, canned, 
dried-salted, smoked and made into fish sauce. It has just enough 
scales to be kosher.</p>

<p>This is a fairly meaty fish with fairly light flesh that is milder
than most mackerel, but definitely could not be called "fish lite". 
There is a substantial streak of dark meat under the skin along the 
lateral line. The flesh stays firm for all methods of cooking but 
breaks up easily on the plate into large flakes. My favorite way to 
enjoy these is to fry them with a light powdering of rice flour and 
eat with a simple sauce. The flavor of the flesh works well fried.</p>

<p>Small bony fish like this take a little special handling to be easily 
edible and not take too much time to prepare. The instructions below 
will produce good results with minimum effort. They will also work with 
other small bony fish.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is particularly available from 
Philippine markets, both on ice and dried, and from other Asian 
markets serving a Southeast Asian community. From the ice, I have paid 
2014 US $1.99 / pound. Frozen 4 to a bag from a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles (San Gabriel), I paid 2017 US $1.35 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; As with most mackerels, this one has only a 
few scales right behind the gill covers, just enough to be kosher. They 
scrape off easily.<p></p>

<h3>Clean:</h3> &nbsp; Nothing unusual here. You won't be using the 
heads, so no need to pull the gills.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; As with other mackerels, the skin is too thin and 
delicate to remove. Leave it on for all methods of cooking. It's flavor 
is stronger than the light flesh, but milder than the dark. It has no 
significant shrink during cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; These fish fillet quite easily. The ribs just 
pull right out of the flesh. There will be tiny centerline pin bones 
for 2/3 of the length, which are easy to find and very easy to remove 
with long nose pliers, several at a time. In smaller fish that are to 
be fried, they will probably just disappear.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp;  A 10-1/2 inch fish weighing 8-1/4 ounces 
uncleaned yielded 4 ounces of skin-on fillet (48%). Smaller fish don't 
yield a lot less.<p></p>

<h3>Method:</h3> 

<ol>
<li>First scale and clean the fish the normal way. The method is on our  
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html">Cleaning &amp; Filleting Round Fish</a> page 
(even though this fish is a bit flat).</li>
<li>Make a cut to the backbone behind the collar on both sides.</li>
<li>Use your kitchen shears to cut through the backbone.</li>
<li>Use your kitchen shears to cut off the skirts diagonally (there's 
  little meat there anyway).</li>
<li>Find all the rib bones, full length or cut short with the skirts, 
  and pull them out with your long nose pliers. You can easily find them 
  with a finger tip, and they pull easily.</li>
<li><b>Options:</b> &nbsp; At this point you could fillet the fish if 
  you desire, they fillet easily - or you can follow the steps here and 
  fry as pan dressed. You could also poach, steam or bake the pan 
  dressed fish instead of frying, but the fins are then more trouble 
  to pull out because they fall apart. If you will use the fish in 
  soups or stews, definitely fillet, or the fins will fall apart and be 
  very unpleasant.</li>
<li>Lightly powder with rice or wheat flour and fry (rice flour is 
  lighter in taste and browns lightly). Deep frying is easiest but you 
  can pan fry them in about 1/8 inch of oil. If you pan fry, you can 
  finish brown them by stand them upright, they'll have spread out so 
  they'll stand up. Drain on paper toweling.</li>
<li>Pull the fins, full length, from both top and bottom. This removes 
  all the most pesky tiny bones and just leaves a groove where the fins 
  were.</li>
<li>Serve whole if desired. It's easy to eat the flesh off the main bones.
</li>
<li>Optionally, you can remove the fillets. They'll come off intact, very 
  easily and be entirely bone free.</li>
<li>Warn your guests to watch for bones anyway, just to be safe.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The heads, bones and fins of this fish are a bit 
too strongly flavored to make a good stock. Discard them.<p></p>
