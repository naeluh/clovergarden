<h1>Chub Mackerel</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_mackjap12g.jpg" alt="Whole Japanese Mackerel" class=mrg>
[Pacific Mackerel, Japanese Mackerel California Mackerel; Saba, Honsaba, 
  Masaba (Japan); <i>Scomber japonicus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Blue Mackerel, 
  Southern Mackerel, Spotted Chub Mackerel; Gomasaba, Marusaba (Japan); 
  <i>Scomber australasicus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Atlantic Chub Mackerel; 
  <i>Scomber colias</i>]
<p>
   These three fish are, for all practical purposes, the same 
   fish, occupying tropical to subarctic waters worldwide. <i>S. japonicus</i> 
   and <i>S. australasicus</i> share the Indo-Pacific region and 
   <i>S. colias</i> occupies the North and South Atlantic.
   <i>S. japonicus</i>, the most commercial of the three, grows to 25 inches 
   and over 6 pounds but the photo specimen is 14-1/4 inches and 1 pound. 
   Held in disrespect in North America for being strong flavored and oily, 
   this fish is highly regarded in Japan (though Atlantic Mackerel 
   (<i>S. scombrus</i>) is preferred). Sold fresh, frozen, salted, smoked 
   and canned, these fish are not considered endangered. They are said to 
   have a few scales and are kosher.</p>

<p>This is a dark meat fish with a high oil content and fairly strong 
flavor. The body cavity is quite long, the rib bones easy to remove and 
it bakes well. This makes it a good fish for stuffing. Many recipes 
for this fish originate in Indonesia and surrounding regions. It is 
also sold in sushi bars as "Saba", if Atlantic mackerel is not available.
</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; There said to be a few small scales, just enough 
to be kosher, but I have yet to find them - apparently you have to be 
a hungry rabbi with a sharp eye.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp;  Nothing unusual here, but the body cavity is 
very long and you need to be careful not to dig into the tender flesh 
when scraping stuff out.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet. Remove the head 
and cut down to the backbone from head to tail, then over the backbone at 
the tail and work forward until you get to the rib cage. Use your kitchen 
shears to cut the ribs from the backbone and pull them from the fillet 
with long nose pliers. They are barely embedded and will pull out easily. 
There are substantial centerline spines almost the full length of the 
fish, but they are easy to find in the soft flesh, pull them out straight 
forward.</p>

<p><b> Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound fish yielded 9-1/4 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (58%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Don't try to skin this fish - the skin is all 
that's holding that tender fillet together. The skin is thin, has very 
moderate shrink and isn't much stronger in flavor than the flesh. This 
fish can be baked whole without slashes in the skin.</p>

<p><b>Stock;</b> &nbsp; Dark oily fish of this sort are not generally used 
to make stock (though some Indonesian stew recipes do cook the head along 
with the rest of the fish).</p>
