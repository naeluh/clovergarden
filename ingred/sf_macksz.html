[Australian Spotted Mackerel; Scomberomorus munroi &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Japanese Spanish Mackerel; <i>Scomberomorus niphonius</i>]
<p>
These two West Pacific fish are often confused and can be considered 
interchangeable. The Japanese is found along the coasts of Japan down 
to Hong Kong, and is the most important mackerel in the Japanese market. 
The Australian is found all around Australia, but mostly in the north, 
around the southern islands of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The 
Australian can grow to 41 inches and 24 pounds, while the Japanese can 
grow to 39 inches and 15 pounds. The photo specimen was 9 inches and 
2-3/4 ounces. The Australian is IUCN Red Listed as NT (Near 
Threatened), while the Japanese is Red Listed as DD (Data Deficient).

<p>These fish are usually eaten pan fried, broiled or baked. For small 
fish, as in the photo, pan frying with a light dusting of rice flour 
works very well, either pan dressed or as fillets. Flavor is moderately 
strong.</p>

<p>These instructions apply to small fish as in the photo. Much larger 
fish may have to be handled a little differently.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish shows up in the Asian markets here 
in Los Angeles, usually as small frozen fish. The photo specimen was 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles for 2015 US $1.99 / 
pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Supposedly, mackerels have enough scales to be 
kosher. Perhaps you have to be a hungry rabbi with sharp eyes to find 
them, because I never have.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Cut the belly from vent to chin. Cut off 
the head the usual way, cutting shallowly below the pectoral fins. 
Pull off the head and most of the guts will come with it. Scrape the 
inside of the body cavity down to the backbone.</p>

<p><b>Filleting</b> &nbsp; Make a cut on both sides of the dorsal fins 
for the full length, and also the anal fins from body cavity to tail. 
Pull these narrow strips away from the fish. Cut off the tail. Use 
your fingers to pry the flesh from the bones. Trim off the thin belly 
flap. On a fish this small there are no centerline pin bones to worry 
about.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Don't even try to skin this fish. The skin may be 
tender, but it's all that's holding the fillet together. It has little 
shrink in cooking and does not have a strong or "off" flavor.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; This mackerel is considered too oily and too 
strong in taste to make a usable fish stock.</p>
