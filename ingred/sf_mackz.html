<h1>Mackerel Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_mackatlan04g.jpg" alt="Whole Atlantic Mackerel" class=mrg>
[family  <i>Scombridae</i> (Mackerels, tunas, bonitos)]
<p>
Mackerels are a large family including several genera of economically 
important fish. On this page you will find the oval bodied mackerels.  
They are generally meaty, oily and strongly flavored, ranging from a 
few ounces to nearly 100 pounds. The deep bodied mackerels will be 
found on our <a href="sf_tunaz.html"><b>Tuna Family</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Mackerel should be handled carefully because of the possibility of 
<a href="seafish.html#hist">Histamine Poisoning</a>. After catching, 
it should be immediately chilled to near freezing, frozen or salted. The 
poisoning is not usually dangerous but can be more serious for persons 
with allergy to bee and wasp stings.</p>

<img src="img/sf_mackatlan04e.jpg" alt="Atlantic Mackerel" class=mrg></a>
[Saba (Japan); <i>Scomber scombrus</i>]
<p>
This North Atlantic mackerel is most commonly found off the European 
coast and in Japanese sushi bars  - large quantities are exported 
to Japan from Norway. There are also strong populations off the U.S. 
Atlantic coast and it is also found in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea 
and off the coast of Morocco. This fish can grow to 23-1/2 inches, but 
the photo specimen was 15 inches long and weighed 1-1/4 pounds before 
being cleaned, stuffed and baked. This fish is kosher, though I'm not 
certain how.

<p>
These three fish are, for all practical purposes, the same 
fish, occupying tropical to subarctic waters worldwide. <i>S. 
japonicus</i>  and <i>S. australasicus</i> share the Indo-Pacific 
region and <i>S. colias</i> occupies the North and South Atlantic.
<i>S. japonicus</i>, the most commercial of the three, grows to 25 
inches and over 6 pounds, but the photo specimen is 14-1/4 inches and 
1 pound. Held in disrespect in North America for being strong flavored 
and oily, this fish is highly regarded in Japan (though Atlantic 
Mackerel (<i>S. scombrus</i>) is preferred). Sold fresh, frozen, 
salted, smoked and canned, these fish are not considered endangered. 
They are said to have a few scales, enough to be kosher, but I have 
yet to find any. &nbsp;

<p>
A highly commercial Indo-West Pacific mackerel found from the Red Sea 
and Madagascar to Samoa, these fish can grow to over 13 inches but the 
photo specimen was 9 inches long and weighed 5-1/4 ounces. This fish 
is not considered threatened and is sold fresh, frozen, canned, 
dried-salted, smoked and made into fish sauce. It has just enough 
scales to be kosher.

<h2>Island Mackerel</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_macisl01e.jpg" alt="Whole Island Mackerel" class=mrg>
[<i>Rastrelliger faughni</i>]
<p>
This Indo West Pacific fish is native from India to as far east as Fiji 
and as far north as Taiwan. It can grow to nearly 8 inches long and 
1-1/2 pounds, but is usually smaller. Nonetheless, it supports a 
fishery reported to be over 800,000 tonnes.  I've not seen them 
in Southern California, but they possibly exist here as one of 
small Philippine dried fish (daing) under some other name. 
Philippine fish names are chaotic.  
IUCN Red List <b>DD</b> (Data Deficient).

<img src="img/sf_macshrt06e.jpg" alt="Whole Short Mackerel" class=mrg></a>
[Hasa-hasa (Philippine); Pla thu (Thai); <i>Rastrelliger brachysoma</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the seas of Southeast Asia as far as Fiji, but 
doesn't venture much into the Indian Ocean. It can grow to nearly 13 
inches long, but is more commonly about 8 inches. This fish is very 
important in the cuisines of Thailand, the Philippines and other 
Southeast Asian countries. &nbsp; Note: &nbsp; I have seen fish in 
Philippine markets in Los Angeles labeled "Hasa-hasa" that was 
actually <a href="sf_scadbez.html">Bigeye Scad</a>. As served in 
Thailand, Short Mackerel looks a little strange, because the backbone 
is broken just behind the head, which is bent down so the fish fits 
in the bamboo steamers used to cook it in salt brine. This fish is 
interchangeable with <a href="sf_mackz.html#ind"><b>Indian Mackerel</b></a>. 
IUCN Red List <b>DD</b> (Data Deficient), but seriously depleted in 
the Gulf of Thailand due to overfishing.

Mackerel is also used. For details see

This prized eating mackerel is found in the Indo-West Pacific and 
Persian Gulf. Its range extends north to the southern tip of Japan 
and south through the Java Sea. It can grow to 30 inches but is 
commonly 21 inches. It is distinguished by round dots about 1/4 
inch diameter on the sides above the centerline. Red List 
status NE (Not Evaluated).

<p>The <b>Streaked Seerfish</b> (dashes instead of spots) grows up to 37 
inches but has a moderately narrower range. The <b>Narrow-barred Spanish 
Mackerel</b> (vertical bars all along the sides) grows a lot larger, to

common through most of the range.

[Kingfish; <i>Scomberomorus cavalla</i>]
<p>
Largest of the fish called mackerel, the king mackerel can weigh 
nearly 100 pounds, measure up to 6 feet long and live for over 20 
years. It is found along the Atlantic coast of the Americas from the 
U.S. / Canada boarder almost to Argentina. Sports fishing brings in 
well over twice the catch of commercial fishing. The photo specimen 
weighed about 13 pounds.

This prized eating mackerel is found along the East Central Pacific 
from Southern California to the northern tip of Chile. It can grow to 
39 inches and 18 pounds but the one in the photo was 20-1/2 inches 
long and weighed 1 pound 11-3/4 ounces. Market size around here is 
between 15 and 22 inches. This fish has rows of gold dots about 1/4 
inch diameter, but they are hard to see in the photo. Red List 
status LC (Least Concern).

<p>
These two West Pacific fish are often confused and can be considered 
interchangeable. The Japanese is found along the coasts of Japan down 
to Hong Kong, and is the most important mackerel in the Japanese market. 
The Australian is found all around Australia, but mostly in the north, 
around the southern islands of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The 
Australian can grow to 41 inches and 24 pounds, while the Japanese can 
grow to 39 inches and 15 pounds. The photo specimen was 9 inches and 
2-3/4 ounces, purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles for 2015 
US $1.99 / pound. The Australian is IUCN Red Listed as NT (Near 
Threatened), while the Japanese is Red Listed as DD (Data Deficient).

   <p>
   Not actually a Mackerel, this highly elongated fish is related to 
   Flying Fish and Needlefish. It often skims along the surface of the 
   water, propelled by its submerged tail. It is found in the North 
   Pacific, ranging from Korea to Alaska and as far south as the 
   tip of Baja, Mexico. This fish can grow to 15 inches but the photo 
   specimen was 12-1/2 inches long and weighed 6 ounces. Mackerel Pike 
   is kosher. It is a highly commercial catch, but with a high 
   reproductive rate is not considered threatened. IUCN Red Listed 
   NE (Not Evaluated).

<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h2>

<p>Mackerel are very high in Omega-3 fish oils, and are not a mercury 
problem. Certain supplement peddlers shrilly declare <u>all</u> fish to 
be mercury problems despite strong evidence to the contrary. After all, 
how could they sell their expensive krill oil if you knew you could just 
go out and buy a mackerel?</p>

<p>Mackerel are delicate and perishable. Fresh fish should be kept 
well refrigerated and cooked promptly. If mishandled they could be subject 
to bacterial action resulting in production of histamines. An overload of 
histamines causes tingling of the lips and mouth, skin rashes, vomiting 
and other symptoms that may last for as long as 12 hours. In most cases 
it is not dangerous, but in the case of persons with allergy to bee and 
wasp stings it can be serious. Such persons should be careful about the 
fish they eat and should carry anti-histamine tablets.</p>
