[Kingfish; <i>Scomberomorus cavalla</i>]
<p>
Largest of the fish called mackerel, this Spanish Mackerel can weigh 
nearly 100 pounds, measure up to 6 feet long and live for over 20 
years. It is found along the Atlantic coast of the Americas from 
the U.S. / Canada boarder almost to Argentina. Sports fishing brings 
in well over twice the catch of commercial fishing. The photo specimen 
weighed about 13 pounds.

<p><b>Prep &amp; Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Despite its importance in the 
Philippines and Southeast Asia, I have not yet found whole Short Mackerel 
here in Southern California. I do have detailed pictorial instructions 
for the nearly identical <a href="sf_mackindz.html">
<b>Indian Mackerel</b></a>, so refer to that page. for normal prep.</p>
<p>In Thailand, this fish is usually served whole, having been gutted 
through the gill slots or by bending the head back.</p>

The photo to the left shows a preparation method used in Thailand. The 
fish are gutted through the gill slots and by bending the head back. The 
Head is then bent forward so they can be fit in the small boiling  
baskets used. Usually this is three fish per basket, but These were 
probably cooked two fish to a basket because all were bent the same. 
They are boiled in heavily salted water. This method allows the fish, 
once boiled, to be held for two days before needing to be re-boiled, 
and it will keep refrigerated for a week or more.</p>

<p>Short Mackerel processed as in the previous paragraph are normally 
fried and served with a dip (see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/smf_fshfrysm1.html"><b>Fried Short Mackerel</b></a>). 
Thais also serve these fish whole and straight on an oval plate doused 
in a curry sauce. In the Philippines, these fish are often fried whole 
and served on an oval plate with dips and sauces. These fish were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 
2020 US $3.99 / pair.

Here is another form, prepred the same way as in the previous paragraph, 
but with the tail bent instead of the head. These were frozen in the 
baskets they were cooked in and bagged in plastic for sale. The fish were 
8-1/2 inchs long in an 8 inch basket. They weighed 8 ounces each. These 
were purchased from the same store as those in the photo above, for 
2020 US $1.49 / basket on special sale.
