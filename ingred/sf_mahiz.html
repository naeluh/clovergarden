[Dolphin, Dolphin-fish, Dorado <i>Coryphaena hippurus</i>]
<p>
This large fish is unrelated to the sea mammal also called "Dolphin" so 
the Hawaiian name Mahi-Mahi is now widely used to avoid confusion. This 
fish is found in tropical and subtropical seas the world around, 
including the deep ociean where few other fish venture. They are a short 
lived fish and are usually caught at about 20 pounds, though they can 
grow to 90 pounds. The flesh is firm and fine grained, and generally cut 
into steaks or fillets. It is often used as a kosher substitute for 
swordfish, IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish can be found in most markets that have 
a decent selection of fish, and will always be sold as steaks. It will 
generally be frozen, and if not, will have been thawed. Better to buy 
frozen - less urgency to use it.</p>
