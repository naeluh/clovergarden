<h1>Mandarin Fish</h1>

[Chinese Perch; <i>Siniperca chuatsi</i>]
<p>
A fresh water fish native to China and the Amur River basin, Mandarin 
Fish is an aggressive predator feeding entirely on the young of other fish 
species.  This fish is called for in many Chinese fish recipes but is very 
rare here in Southern California - and rather expensive when it is available. 
Now farmed as well as caught wild, this fish can grow to nearly 28 inches 
and 17 pounds, but the photo specimen was 11-1/4 inches long and weighed 
15-5/8 ounces. USDN Red List status: Not Evaluated.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; .This fish has flesh of a rather delicate taste. 
For this reason I recommend against pan frying because you'll mainly taste 
you oil and whatever you dusted the fillets with. It is very good poached 
and served with a delicate sauce that does not overwhelm (I use 1/3 lemon 
juice, 2/3 white wine with a just little butter and a little chili).</p>
<p>The flesh of this fish remains firm enough for most wet cooking methods. 
It can be used in soup, but add it near the end. Fillets tend to split 
lengthwise along the seams, but doen't flake apart much until you want them 
to. Flakes are quite large.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I have purchased whole, uncleaned fish at a very 
large Asian market (San Gabriel SuperStore) in Los Angeles. I have seen 
it nowhere else, and at U.S. $6.99 per pound for whole, uncleaned fish it 
is among the very highest price fish in the Asian markets.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with small scales that have 
good adhesion so some vigor is needed to scrape them off. Some won't scrape 
and will need to be shaved off with the sharp edge of your prep knife..</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The guts and membrains inside this fish are 
tough and relatively hard to pull. You'll need to use your kitchen shears 
more than with most fish, and especilly to cut out the gills which are 
in hard.</p>

<p><b>Fillets:</b> &nbsp; The skin is a bit tough, but otherwise this 
fish fillets fairly easily. Cut down to the backbone, then over the 
backbone at the tail end and forward to the rib cage. Cut the ribs from 
the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long 
nose pliers. They pull a bit hard but take almost no flesh. There are 
quite a few centerline spines but they're in tight and too soft to pull. 
They don't seem to be a problem after cooking. </p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; I recomend removing the skirt to the extent of the 
inside membrane because it can have an "off" taste. You only loose 3/8 ounce 
per fillet by doing so. A 15-5/8 ounce fish yielded 6-1/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (39%) and 5-5/8 ounces skin-off (36%). Both yields are with 
the skirt cut off. The yield is low because of a large head and heavy 
bones. Use those to make stock.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is fairly strong and will curl fillets. 
It does not have a strong or "off" taste, but is a bit stronger than the 
flesh. The skin is quite tough, so it's easy to remove using the standard 
long knife and cutting board method.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head (split), fins and bones, simmered  slowly 
for 30 to 40 minutes, make a very nice almost clear stock with mild 
flavor. Very usable.</p>
