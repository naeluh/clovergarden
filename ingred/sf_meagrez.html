[Croaker, Jewfish, Shade-fish, Sowa, Kir, Corvina, Salmon-bass, Stone bass; 
<i>Argyrosomus regius</i>]
<p>Native to the East Atlantic coasts, Mediterranean, and Black Seas, this 
fish has also invaded the Red Sea. It is found from Norway south to 
Congo, but is scarce north of France. It can grow to 90 inches and 
227 pounds, but is more commonly 59 inches. </p>
<p>This fish is harvested commercially, but is also caught in recreational 
fishing. The main fisheries are Mauritania, Morocco, and Egypt, accounting 
for 80% of the catch. European catches are relatively small, in Spain, 
Portugal, and France. Aquaculture is still developing along the Mediterranean 
coasts of Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.
IUCN Red List status LC (Least Concern).

<p>The flesh of this fish is very mild, and should not offend those who are 
not fish aficionados, but may disappoint those who are. I have found no 
recipes using Meagre for soups or stews, so I presume it is too tender for 
wet cooking, similar to some other Drums and Croakers.</p>

<h3>Cooking</h3> &nbsp; This fish can be quite large, so is most often 
cooked as fillets - some recipes asking for "skin-on". Pan frying and 
baking are popular. Smaller fish are also available and may be cooked 
whole, mostly by oven roasting with vegetables, but can also be grilled,
<p></p> 

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This is an East Atlantic fish, so I have no personal 
experience with it, but (at least smaller ones) are probably similar to the
