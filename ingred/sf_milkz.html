<h1>Milkfish / Bangus</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_bangus56g.jpg" alt="Whole Milkfish" class=mrg>
[Bangus (Philippine); <i>Chanos chanos</i>]
<p>
This Indo-Pacific warm water fish is very difficult to catch in 
the wild. They're extremely suspicious, very sensitive to motion, strong 
and lightning fast - characteristics enabling them to survive since the 
Cretaceous when dinosaurs still ruled.  All commercially available 
milkfish is farmed.</p>

<p>Milkfish is an important food fish in India, Southeast Asia and and 
particularly in the Philippines where it is the "National Fish". While 
they can grow to almost 6 feet and over 30 pounds in the wild, farmed 
milkfish is generally marketed at 18 inches and smaller.  The photo 
specimen was 17-1/4 inches and 1 pounds 14 ounces. "Baby milkfish" less 
than 11 inches long are common in fish markets serving a Philippine 
community.</p>

<p><b>Milkfish</b> (Bangus) is a delicious fish. Its nearly white flesh 
is neither too strong nor too mild, and many Filipinos consider all other 
fish inferior. There is a thin dark layer just under the skin and a dark 
strip down the center but the dark parts are still quite mild.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Bangus is always cooked skin-on for reasons 
which are fully explained below. The skin has no shrink during cooking. 
The flesh cooks firm and and this fish can be cooked by any method, but 
is not cooked whole (except "baby bangus"), also for reasons explained 
below. When frying you need a light dusting of rice flour to keep the 
skin from sticking to the pan and/or turner, peeling off and making a 
mess.</p>

<p>Bangus is excellent poached in a court bouillon 
(see <a href="../recipes/gmf_fishpoach1.html"><b>Poaching Fish</b></a> - 
I use the #3 court bouillon (with variations). Poach skin-on and slip off 
the skin before serving if you don't want it, but I recommend eating it 
with the skin for best flavor.</p>

<p>Baby bangus is often deep fried, or cooked in oil "sardine style". 
They are commonly served with head and tail intact, though the heads can 
be removed if you desire. They should be quite small or the pin bones 
won't cook soft and will be a problem.</p>

<p>A popular cooking method in the Philippines is Daing na Bangus. Here 
the Bangus is butterflied, cutting from the top, leaving the belly 
intact. It is deboned (or not) marinated in vinegar and garlic, and 
fried. Often served for breakfast.</p> 

<p><b>Pin Bones:</b> &nbsp; For people not accustomed to eating Carp, Bangus 
has a major problem - the flesh is shot through with about 180 thin 
pin bones. These are part of the fish's sensory system, allowing it to 
detect tiny changes in the water column. Fortunately, the pin bones are 
in bundles so you don't have to deal with each one individually. Unlike 
the Bangus' distant relative, the Carp, these pin bones can be removed 
before cooking.</p>

<p>You'll find some bangus recipes cook the fish with plenty of vinegar 
to soften the pin bones to edibility, but that only works with the "baby 
bangus" size fish. For larger fish and other recipes the pin bones need 
to be removed or dealt with at the table. In the Philippines people at 
the markets make their living deboning bangus but we don't have that 
option here - you're on your own. See our instructions for 
<a href="sf_milkb.html"><b>Deboning a Bangus</b></a>. Philippine 
markets always carry pre-deboned bangus in the frozen food section if 
you're not up to doing it yourself.</p>

<p>Given the number of Philippine  recipes calling for sections of bangus 
cut crosswise, Filipinos are clearly accustomed to dealing with pin bones 
at the table, just as people worldwide (except in North America) do with 
carp. I recommend never cutting sections less than about 2 inches long or 
the pin bones will get unmanageable. You can debone the sections by 
feeling the cut surface and pulling the pin bones but this is very 
tedious because the pin bone bundles have been cut into a lot of little 
pin bone pieces. I suggest deboning the whole bangus and use slices of 
fillet if you don't want to deal with pin bones at the table.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Bangus is completely covered by small 
silver scales with good adhesion - thus it takes vigorous scraping to 
remove them and they'll be flying about. For some recipes that fry the 
fish crisp on the skin side, the scales are not removed and are eaten 
with the skin.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Bangus an easy fish to clean, and the gills 
pull out fairly easily. When all cleaned out, the belly part 
will have a thin black lining. This is normal. In some cases the fish 
is split from the top and cleaned, leaving the belly intact.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; Bangus is an easy fish to fillet, but it's 
often done a bit differently from other fish. See the early steps in 
<a href="sf_milkb.html"><b>Deboning a Bangus</b></a> for details. 
However you do it, you definitely want to cut the ribs from the backbone 
with kitchen shears, then use your long nose pliers to pull the ribs 
from the fillet - they pull easily. If using it separately, you can cut 
the belly from the rest of the fillet before or after deboning. If 
before, there will be a few short pin bones to pull from it. The head, 
bones and fins make a very light fish stock with only a little oil.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Because of it's small head bangus has a high 
yield. A 17 inch 1 pound 14 ounce fish yielded skin-on fillets (including 
the belly fat) of 1 pound 3 oz (63%). With the belly portion cut off for 
other uses it was still 15-1/8 ounces (50%). You can expect about 3 
ounces of belly from each bangus.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin of this fish does not have a strong or 
"off" flavor and has no shrink with any method of cooking. The skin is 
not difficult to remove by the regular long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a> - but don't remove it. By 
time you get all the pin bones out you need the skin to hold the fillet 
together. Bangus is almost always cooked skin-on. When frying you need 
a light dusting of rice flour to keep the skin from sticking to the pan 
and turner, peeling off and making a mess. This is not needed if the 
fish is fried scales-on.</p>

<p><b>Belly Fat</b> &nbsp; There's an unusual thick layer of belly fat on 
the lower walls of the abdominal cavity. This scrapes off easily, but that 
wouldn't be done in the Philippines. Bangus belly with this fat is wildly 
popular there and the bellies are often sold separately from the rest of 
the bangus (at a higher price) or in combination with the head (used for 
soup stock). There are many recipes that exploit this cut, particularly 
for smoked or fried bangus belly, but for normal fish recipes the fat 
can be scraped off leaving the underlying flesh.</p>
