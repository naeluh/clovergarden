<h1>Mantis Shrimp</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_mntamta03d.jpg" alt="Mantis Shrimp, side view" class=mrg>
[Class <i>Malacostraca</i>; Subclass <i>Hoplocarida</i>; Order 
<i>Stomatopoda</i>; Family <i>Squillidae</i>]
<p>
These assassins of the coastline are not even as closely related to 
regular shrimp as are crabs and lobsters, having branched from a common 
<i>Malacostraca</i> ancestor about 410 million years ago.  While they 
are very common along all tropical and subtropical coastlines, and a few 
live in temperate regions, they are little known because they spend most 
of their time in deep burrows. Most only come out at night to prey upon 
other crustaceans, small fish, and anything else that moves. The largest 
on record was 18 inches long, from the Indian River of the southeastern 
United States.</p>

<p>The claws of these crustaceans are either clubs or spears. They kill 
their prey by projecting these claws at about 75 feet per second, and 
even if they miss, the prey may be stunned by the collapse of cavitation 
bubbles caused by the high velocity movement. They can cause painful 
injury to humans who are not careful in handling them. They cannot be 
kept in an aquarium because of their habit of killing and eating all 
the other creatures, even ones quite larger than themselves.</p>

<p>They have very complex eyes that can move independently, but they 
have depth perception in both eyes independent of each other. They 
also have up to 16 different color receptors, while humans have only 
three, and they can see light from deep ultraviolet to far red, as 
well as polarized light. We cannot even imagine how colorful the world 
looks to these critters.<p>

<p>Study of the unique properties of the Mantis Shrimp club claw is 
proceeding with the expectation it can help create a new generation of 
ultra strong composite structural materials and body armor.

<h2>Shako</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_mntask04g.jpg" alt="Shako Mantis Shrimp" class=mrg>
[Shako (Japan); Be be, T&ocirc;m t&iacute;t, B&agrave;an Chai (Viet); 
L&agrave;i ni&agrave;o xia, Laaih niu ha (Cantonese); Tatampal, 
Hipong-dapa, Alupihang-dagat (Philippine); <i>Oratosquilla oratoria</i>]
<p>
This Mantis Shrimp is popular in East and Southeast Asia, growing to 
about 7.3 inches long, but the longest in the batch I purchased was 
6-1/4 inches and weighed 1-1/4 ounces. The flesh tastes more like lobster 
than like shrimp, but there's very little of it to eat. This critter is 
mostly armor and legs, and the tail may be filled with orange eggs (which 
you eat along with the flesh.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have found Mantis Shrimp frozen in trays 
in a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra). They cost 2019 
US $3.99 for a 1 pound tray. Of course, most of that weight is shell 
and internal water. 
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Japan, Shako are boiled and served as a 
topping for sushi rice. In Vietnam, they are steamed, boiled, or grilled, 
and eaten with one or another of the popular dips. In Southeast China, 
they are usually deep fried, and in the Philippines are cooked like 
regular shrimp.<p></p>

<h3>Shelling <small>&amp;</small> Eating:</h3> &nbsp; These have far 
harder shells than regular Shrimp. Here's the procedure I use:
<ol>
<li>Drop the Mantis into boiling water - <b>Do Not Overcook</b> or the 
  flesh will fall apart and you will not be able to get it out of the 
  shell. About 3 minutes should be plenty.</li>
<li>Break off the first joint of the claws. Break off the claw end and 
  pull the flesh out and eat it.</li>
<li>Twist off the head and discard.</li>
<li>With kitchen shears - cut the tail off from the last segment, then 
  pull off the two flippers just in front of it.</li> 
<li>With kitchen shears - cut off both edges, taking off about 1/8 inch. 
  This will free the top and bottom shells from each other.</li>
<li>Pull off the legs and all the swimmerets on the bottom side. Don't 
  pull too many at once or you'll have problems.</li>
<li>Peel off the top shell. You'll have a little trouble with the last 
  segment in front of the tail as it is quite stiff.</li>
<li>Starting from the big end, carfully pry the flesh off the bottom 
  shell. If you haven't over-cooked the Mantis, it should come off in 
  one piece.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; This is an item you eat for entertainment, not 
for nutrition - yield is irellevant - but, I've measured it anyway, 
at 34% edible.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Heads and shells can be simmered slowly for about 
40 minutes. The stock will be stronger and sweeter than from regular 
shrimp, and there probably won't be a lot of it, but it can be a good 
addition to a fish stock.<p></p>

[<i>Squilla mantis</i>]
<p>
This is the only Mantis Shrimp caught commercially in the Mediterranean, 
as it is by far the most common. Most are caught on the Italian side of 
the Adriatic Sea, but they are also caught in the Ionian Sea, around 
the island of Sardinia, along the coast of Catalonia, and the Balearic 
Islands. It does, however, live also on the Atlantic coast, from the 
Gulf of C&aacute;dz in southern Spain, on south to Angola, and around 
the Canary Islands and Madeira. It is particularly abundant in areas 
that have runoff from major rivers. These Mantis Shrimp can grow to 
about 8 inches long.

<h2>American Mantis</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_mntaamr01g.jpg" alt="Whole American Mantis Shrimp" class=mrg>
[<i>Squilla empusa</i>]
<p>This Mantis Shrimp is native to the Western Atlantic, from Cape Cod 
to the Gulf of Mexico.  It is also reported from Brazil and the 
Mediterranean. This crustation can grow to 12 inches long, possibly 
longer.  I know of no commercial harvest in North America.
