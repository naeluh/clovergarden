<h1>Monkfish</h1>

[Angler; Queue de Lotte (French); <i>Lophius americanus</i> (North 
America), <i>Lophius piscatorius</i> (Europe)]
<p>
Monkfish is not a swimmer, but an ambush hunter that blends into the sea 
floor. It is mostly a huge, ugly, inedible bony head with a small tail 
sticking out the back side of it. This explains why you'll never see a 
whole monkfish in the fish market - only the tail is sold. The American 
Monkfish can grow to 47 inches and 57 pounds, the European to 78 inches 
and 127 pounds but these figures are meaningless since most of the fish 
is inedible.</p>
<p>The European Monkfish is found from the Arctic seas north 
of Finland and around Iceland, down through the Mediterranian and along 
the west coast of Africa as far south as the northern border of Angola. 
Some have been reported from the coast of New England. The American is 
found from northeastern Florida to Newfoundland, Canada, but is rare 
south of North Carolina or north of Quebec. The European is considered 
heavily over-fished, though still IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern), 
while the American is IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated).
Monkfish makes no effort whatever to be kosher.

<p>Monkfish is highly sought after for the unique characteristics of it's 
flesh. It somewhat resembles lobster in flavor and stays firm and solid 
even if overcooked. This makes it excellent for grilling on skewers, 
because it won't crumble and fall off. It is a costly fish, tails 
selling for 2006 US $6.00 / pound in Korean markets here in Los Angeles. 
</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1.3 pound monkfish tail yielded 15 oz of clean 
flesh (72%).</p>
<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The bones, skin, fins, membranes etc. make a 
very nice mild soup stock, but one fish isn't going to make a whole 
lot of it so blend with other mild fish stock if you need more.</p>

<p>Monkfish is very easy to process because most of the work has already 
been done.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull the skin off over the tail and cut off the tail.</li>
<li>With your fillet knife follow the fins and heavy backbone from top 
to bottom being careful to take all the flesh.</li>
<li>With the help of your fillet knife pull off all loose membranes, 
cutting wherever they threaten to pull away any of the flesh. I'm not 
sure what those two darker lumps up at the front are but I pull them off 
and toss them in the stock pot with all the skin, membranes, bones, fins, 
etc.</li>
<li>At this point you have two thick fillets. Most recipes will call for 
them to be cut into chunks crosswise. Any remaining membranes will 
shrink when cooked but cut this way they aren't a problem.</li>
</ol>
