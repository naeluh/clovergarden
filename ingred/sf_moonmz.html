[Mexican Moonfish,<i>Selene  orstedii</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
Hairfin lookdown; <i>Selene brevoortii</i>]
<p>
Both the species listed above are sold as "Mexican Moonfish" in the 
markets, though <i>S. brevoortii</i> is officially Hairfin Lookdown 
(fishbase). They are easily confused, but <i>S. brevoortii</i> grows 
a little larger (15 vs 13 inches) and has very tiny pelvic fins - 
barely visible in the photo directly down from the pectoral fin root. 
<i>S orstedii</i> has small pelvic fins but not tiny.</p>
<p>These fish are Related to Jacks and Pompanos, and are found along the 
East Pacific coast from Baja California to Ecuador in South America. 
The photo specimen (<i>S. brevoortii</i>) was 13-1/2 inches long and 
weighed 1 pound 0 ounces. Mexican Moonfish reproduce well and are not 
considered threatened. They are not kosher due to lack of removable 
scales.</p>

<p>
The flesh of this fish is medium colored and medium flavored, much like 
the related Jacks. There is a narrow dark strip down the sides of the 
backbone but it is not unpleasant in taste. I do not, however, like the 
taste of the skin.</p>

<p>I have eaten this fish most successfully poached, either as skinned 
fillets or as a "pan dressed" fish. This fish holds together well and can 
be managed on the plate where I gently scrape off the skin before eating.
</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish shows up very occasionally in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Los Angles. It's not a fish you can just 
go out and buy, you deal with it when you see it. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 
2019 US $3.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; There are no scales. There are supposedly some 
"scutes", which are modified scales along the lateral line near the tail. 
While the line can be easily seen, the scutes are difficult to detect. 
While scutes are technically scales, they can't be scraped off without 
damaging the skin, so this fish remains "unkosher".<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; The best way to handle this fish is to remove 
the head as shown in the photo to the left. This allows very easy removal 
of the innards which is difficult by any other means. The throat opening is 
very high and rather small, and the keel bones run full length so you'd have 
to make an incision on one side. The body cavity is very short and elongated 
vertically. To use the heads for stock you need to remove the gills, best 
done with a sturdy pair of long nose pliers.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet. The bone 
structure is complete, sturdy, and very easy to follow with a knife, 
and the flesh is firm. I usually cut off the bottom 1/2 inch of the fish 
to remove the keel and make filleting easier. When you get to the rib 
cage, just cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears. The ribs 
are very long, but few. Pull them with your long nosed pliers. They will 
take some flesh, but there's very little flesh to take, except for the 
last two. Just cut off the skirt where it has no flesh left, There are 
a few centerline spines that should be pulled out forward for the length 
of the body cavity.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; the skin is very thin, but also strong and very 
elastic. It has a lot of shrink on a pan fried fillet, but doesn't give 
a problem with poaching. I don't like the taste and recommend removing it. 
Though surprisingly "stretchy", the skin can be removed using the usual 
long knife and cutting board  <a href="seafishsr.html">
<b>Method</b></a>. If you end up with a couple modest patches of skin 
left on the fillet (I usually do), they are difficult to remove, but 
won't be a problem. If you poach "pan dressed" fish the skin can be 
gently scraped off on the plate, working from the centerline to the edges.
<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 9-7/8 ounce fish yielded 4-3/4 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (48%) which were 4-1/8 ounces skin removed (42%).<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The flesh of this fish remains firm enough that 
skinned fillets, though thin, can be poached without breaking up. Baking 
and similar methods will also work fine, though I recommend using skinless 
fillets for most purposes.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Heads, bones, and fins make a quite usable stock 
simmered for 1/2 hour. There will be little oil, but it should still be 
separated off using your gravy separator. I suggest not using the skins.
