[<i>Mene maculata</i> of family <i>Menidae</i>]
<p>
This Indo - Pacific fish is found from the eastern coast of Africa through 
the South Pacific islands and as far north as the southern tip of Japan. This 
species, the only member of the Menidae (Moonfish) family, can grow to nearly 
12 inches but the photo specimen was 8-1/4 inches and weighed 7.7 ounces. In 
its home range moonfish is often dried and can be dried without salt. Having 
no scales it is not kosher and is not listed as threatened.</p>

<p>This is a weirdly built fish, but more edible than you might expect for 
something that flat and bony. The flesh is moderately flavored, is firm 
raw and remains quite firm when cooked by any method.</p>
<p>Gutting this fish neatly is a bit of a problem because the body cavity is 
small and vertical, only about 1/4 inch wide at the bottom of the fish. I find 
the best plan is to just cut off the head, taking the body cavity and 
innards with it as shown. You're not going to be losing much edible doing 
this. Use a combination of your filleting knife and kitchen shears to do 
this.</p>
<p>You can fry this fish "pan dressed" with just a dusting of rice flour 
and it's not that hard to disassemble on the plate because the bones are 
pretty much fused to the fins at the edge of the fish. Start from the 
outside edges and work inward.</p>
<p>It's less easy to eat if steamed because the bones and fins tend to fall 
apart and make a mess that's difficult to recover the flesh from.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's surprisingly easy to fillet this fish becaue the 
flesh is so firm. Almost no edible flesh will be lost if you're careful. 
Filleting makes eating this fish a lot neater 
and less trouble, or the fillets can be used in recipes. Yield is surprisingly 
good with a 4.6 ounce fish yielding 2.3 ounces skin-on (50%) and 2.0 ounces 
skinless (43%).</p>
<p>The skin shrinks very little when fried so can be left on even for frying 
fillets. While very thin the skin is reasonably strong so it can be removed 
by the usual long knife and cutting board method.</p>
