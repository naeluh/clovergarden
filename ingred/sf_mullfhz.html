<h1>Gray Mullet</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_mulletg08g.jpg" alt="Whole Gray Mullet" class=mrg>
[Flathead Mullet, Striped Mullet, Black Mullet; Aguas, Banak, Gisaw 
(Philippine); Manla, Kasmeen, Boita, Tirutha, Bhoita, Ain (India); 
<i>Mugil cephalus</i>]
<p>
Found world wide in tropical and subtropical coastal waters, estuaries, 
and even rivers, these fish are mainly vegetarians, and thus are prey 
for just about everything else. They can grow to 47 inches and 26 pounds 
but the photo specimen was 15-1/2 inches, weighing 1 pound 6-1/2 ounces. 
Very tiny "baby mullet" are also sometimes found in the fish markets. 
Mullet are caught wild and farmed, and are not considered threatened. 
They are not often seen in North American markets except along the 
Southeast Coast and in Asian fish markets in Southern California, but 
are a very important commercial fish in many parts of the world. It is 
a good medium flavor eating fish - look for it in Philippine and 
Southeast Asian fish markets.</p>

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; Gray Mullet has medium colored flesh and 
good medium flavor, a bit stronger skin-on.  There is a wide but thin 
region of darker meat under the skin, and a deep dark band at the 
centerline. The dark meat is part of the flavor of the fish because 
there is too much of it to remove. Mullet should be purchased as fresh 
as possible and eaten or frozen the same day.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Because of its broad head, mullet is most 
suitable for use as fillets, or "pan dressed" for baking or steaming. 
The flesh is soft and beaks apart randomly rather than in orderly flakes, 
and isn't firm enough to use in soups or stews. It is too tender to lift 
a whole fillet from a baked or steamed fish. For baking or steaming, 
cut a few diagonal slashes through the skin so it doesn't tear the 
flesh.

<p>Fillets are good for pan frying and you can fry fillets skin-on, 
producing a nice crisp skin. Dust both sides with salted rice flour and 
fry the inside first, then flip skin side down. Hold the fillet down 
with your turner for a few seconds until the skin relaxes.</p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Gray Mullet is covered with very large strong 
scales that take a bit of energy to scrape off, and they fly around a 
lot.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp;  Nothing unusual here except the body cavity 
is large and can be filled with really yucky stuff, and there may be 
two large pouch of roe. The gills pull out fairly easily, but are not 
easy to get at. This is not really a problem since you will probably 
not be using the head, as this is not a good fish for stock.<p></p>

<h3>Roe:</h3>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_mulroe02e.jpg" alt="Gray Mullet White Roe" class=mrg>
In the autumn, mullet may be carrying two pouches of roe. This may be 
"Yellow Roe" (eggs) or "White Roe" (sperm). You will not be finding 
fish with yellow roe at your fish market, as it is quite valuable.  
Fish containing it will be factory cleaned, with the roe immediately 
shipped to Italy or Asia.
<p>The white roe is of little value, but is consumed locally. It is 
usually seasoned, dusted with flour and pan fried, then eaten with a 
squeeze of lemon. It may also be made into patties with eggs and 
scallions. The photo to the left shows White Roe from two 2 pound 
fish. These pouches were about 7-1/2 inches long and weighed about 
3 ounces per fish.</p>
<p>Durring "mullet runs" in Florida, asshole opportunists join the 
fishing. They check the fish for roe, and thousands of white roe fish 
are tossed overboard dead. This is unacceptable behavior.</p> 

<h3>Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; This fish fillets quite easily, but treat it 
gently as the flesh is soft. When you get to the rib cage, cut the ribs 
from the backbone with kitchen shears and then pull them from the fillet 
with your long nose pliers - they are large, few, and pull easily. There 
are also a few centerline pin bones that are a lot larger than pins, but 
they are easy to find and pull. Once you have pulled the ribs, you can 
easily peel off the black lining of the body cavity with your long nose 
pliers.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 6-1/2 ounce fish yielded 9-5/8 oz of 
skin-on fillet (43%) and 8-1/4 oz of skinless fillet (37%). Results 
with a couple of 2 pound fish were quite similar, but skin-off yield 
was just a little higher. Yield is moderate due to the fish's heavy 
head.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has a flavor just a bit stronger than 
the flesh. It has very moderate shrinkage in cooking, and quickly 
relaxes. It can sometimes be peeled off by hand but the usual long knife 
and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a> works well. For smaller 
fish, You may lose most of the belly when skinning, but there really 
won't be much there to lose.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Heads, bones and fins, simmered for about 
40 minutes, make a murky, oily, medium flavored stock that isn't one 
of my favorites.<p></p>
