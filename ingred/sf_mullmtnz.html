<p>
While most Mullets are salt water fish, this one spends its adult life in 
fresh water - juveniles are sometimes found in brackish waters. It is found 
in rivers from sea level to over 2000 feet, from North Carolina around the 
Gulf of Mexico to Venezuela, and on the Islands of the Caribbean. It can grow 
to 14 inches and is a non commercial subsistence catch. IUCN Red List LC 
(Least Concern), but overfished in Costa Rica.

<h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is considered a delicacy in Jamaica and 
is quite popular in Costa Rica. Its main problem is lots of small bones. 
This mullet is very much like the <a href="sf_mullfhz.html"><b>Gray 
Mullet</b></a>, so that page should be valid for preparing this fish, 
though the flavor will be a bit different.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Jamaica, this fish is often wrapped in buttered 
paper and fried, to be sent to the table in the paper. It can also be fried 
plain or poached. Mullet doesn't hold together well in wet cooking such as 
soups or stews.
