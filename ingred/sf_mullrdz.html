[Yellow Spot Goatfish, <i>Parupeneus indicus</i>]
</p><p>
   This tropical Indo/Pacific Goatfish is found from the east coast of Africa 
   to the southwest coast of Mexico and as far south as the northern coast of 
   Australia. It adopts a number of color schemes but is often marketed in its 
   red form as "Red Mullet". All have the round dark spot at the tail and a 
   large yellow spot at the lateral line between the two dorsal fins - but in 
   the red form that spot is only faintly visible.</p>

   <p>Be aware that this is not the "Red Mullet" called for in European 
   recipes. Those fish, the <a href="sf_mullsrz.html"><b>European Red 
   Mullets</b></a> are related but usually sold smaller, between 2-1/2 and 
   8 ounces.</p>

   <p>This is a superb eating fish, but not common here in Southern 
   California. They can grow to nearly 18 inches but fish in my test batch 
   were about 12-1/2 inches long weighing 1 pound. The photo specimen is a bit 
   smaller because the idiots at the market had broken the tails of all the 
   larger fish to fit them in a foam tray that was too small - an outrage 
   that would never happen in the Philippine and Southeast Asian markets here. 
   Red list status: Not Evaluated.

<p><b>General:</b> &nbsp; Indian Goatfish is a very fine eating fish with 
mild, firm white flesh suitable for most method of cooking. It easily 
breaks up into large flakes on the plate.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; I don't recommend cooking this whole, because 
the many large centerline spines, other small bones associated with the 
fins, and difficulty making sure all the transparent scales have been 
removed make it difficult to eat. Fillets are easily made bone and 
scale free. Also the skin shrinks quite a bit which is not desirable in 
a fish steamed or baked whole. On the other hand, skinless fillets poach 
very nicely and pan fry even better. Just dust lightly with rice flour 
and fry in pure olive oil.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with very large but 
rather thin scales that take moderate energy to scrape off. Some will 
simply fold over, but are easy to pull off with your fingers. The fish 
is easy to clean but the throat is so strong you'll have to cut it with 
shears. The gills pull out fairly easily.</p>

<p><b>Fillets:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet but the short rib 
cage is difficult to follow. When you get to the rib cage just use your 
shears to cut the ribs from the backbone and use long nose pliers to pull 
them from the fillet. There are also many very significant centerline spines 
which need to be pulled for the front half of the fillet. Pull forward with 
long nose pliers.</p>

<p>Fillet yield is moderate due to the fish's large head, a 1 pound 
fish yielding about 7-1/8 oz of skinless fillet (45%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin of this fish does not have a strong or 
"off" flavor but it does shrink quite a bit when cooking so is 
best removed. The skin is thin but tough so it's easy to remove by the 
long knife and cutting board technique.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head fins and bones make a light 
flavorful stock with very little oil, one of the finest and most usable 
fish stocks you can have.</p>
