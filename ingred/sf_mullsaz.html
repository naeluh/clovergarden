[Harder (Afrikaans); <i>Liza richardsonii</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to costal waters around the southern tip of 
Africa and off the west coast of Madagascar. It can grow to 18 inches 
but is more commonly around 12 inches. It was much used by early 
Dutch settlers in South Africa, but was probably already much used 
by the natives. It is fished commercially, and IUCN listed as NE 
(Not Evaluated).

<b>General:</b> &nbsp;  This mullet is very much like the 
<a href="sf_mullfhz.html">Gray Mullet</a>, so that page should be 
valid for this fish.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; In South Africa this fish is most often 
salted and dried, whence it is called "Bokkom", and it is sometimes 
smoked. I also have a recipe from the early Dutch settlers of South 
Africa that pickles it as "Herring".
