[<i>Mullus surmuletus</i> (striped red mullet) &nbsp; | &nbsp; also 
<i>Mullus barbatus</i> (red mullet)]
<p>
<i>M. surmuletus</i> and <i>M. barbatus</i> are nearly identical, and 
both come in various color schemes, not always red. The photo is of 
<i>M. surmuletus</i>. These are the "Red Mullet" called for in European 
cookbooks, but you're unlikely to find them in North America. 
<i>M. barbatus</i> can grow to 13 inches and 1-1/2 pounds. It is found 
mostly in the western Mediterranean and along the coast of Morocco. 
<i>M. surmuletus</i> can grow to 15 inches and 2 pounds. It is also 
found in the Western Mediterranean and the coast of Morocco, but is 
most common around the British Isles and in the North Sea. Both are 
usually marketed at between 2-1/2 and 8 ounces. Both are IUCN Red List 
LC (Least Concern)

<p><b>General:</b> &nbsp; These Red Mullet are considered very fine 
eating fish in Europe, but are largely unavailable in North America. The 
"red mullet" sold here is generally the <a href="sf_mullrdz.html">
<b>Indian Goatfish</b></a>, which is a quite suitable substitute.</p>
