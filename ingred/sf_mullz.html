[Mullet; Family <i>Mullidae</i>]
<p>
Mullets are a fairly large family of mostly salt water fish, They have 
always been very popular in the Mediterranean area and costal Europe but 
little used in North America. They are now very common in the Asian markets 
here in Southern California. Confusingly, the best know "mullet", the Red 
Mullet, is not a mullet at all but a

Found worldwide in coastal waters, this fish can grow to 47 inches and 
26 pounds but the photo specimen was 15-1/2 inches, weighing 1 pound 
6-1/2 ounces. They are caught wild and farmed and are not considered 
threatened. They are not common in North American markets except along 
the Southeast Coast, but are a very important commercial fish in many parts 
of the world. It is a good eating fish - look for it in Philippine and 
Southeast Asian fish markets.

This fish is native to costal waters around the southern tip of 
Africa and off the west coast of Madagascar. It can grow to 18 inches 
but is more commonly around 12 inches. It was much used by early 
Dutch settlers in South Africa, but was probably already much used 
by the natives. It is fished commercially, and IUCN listed as NE 
(Not Evaluated).
