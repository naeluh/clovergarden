This very large perch is native to the large rivers of East Africa, 
Central Africa and Ghana in West Africa. It has been introduced to 
Lake Victoria with considerable disruption of the lake ecology. It 
can grow to 6 feet 6 inches and weigh 440 pounds. Nile Perch is a very 
important food fish in the parts of Africa where it is found, and is 
also exported to Europe. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern)- considered 
a serious invasive in some regions.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is not available in North America, 
but suitable substitutes are available. It is fairly available in 
Europe.</p>

<p><b>Prep:</b> &nbsp; You can follow the details for 
<a href="sf_barrz.html"><b>Baramundi</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; This fish is very similar to and closely related 
to the Indo-West Pacific <a href="sf_barrz.html"><b>Baramundi</b></a>, 
which is also a large river fish. Baramundi is quite available in the 
Asian Markets here in Southern California as "Giant Perch", and is 
farmed in a number of countries. If not available, Walleye can be used 
in North America or Zander in Europe, though Nile Perch is often 
available there.
