<h1>Cooking Large Octopus</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_octo26g.jpg" alt="A Large Octopus" class=mrg>
<p>
Large octopus in Southern California markets range from about 1-1/2 pounds 
to 4-1/2 pounds - but when buying remember that it shrinks a great deal when 
cooked.</p>
<p>The photo specimen weighted 2.2 pounds at purchase with a tentacle span of 
about 59 inches, but by time I finished photographing it so much water had 
drained out it was down to 1.8 pounds. It continued to drain overnight in 
the fridge and was down to 1.5 pounds in the morning. By time it was 
cooked long enough to eat (about 1-1/2 hours) it was down to 10 ounces.

<p>Select your octopus for the intended purpose. If you are going to serve 
with the skin and sucker disks intact, 3-1/2 pounds is about as large as 
you want to go. Larger and you'll have to cook it so long the skin will 
be coming off and it'll look ugly.</p>
<p>If you will be rubbing off the skin and disks to get smooth white 
cylinders, select an octopus 3 pounds or larger, so the tentacles 
are still a reasonable size and you don't have to overcook to get the 
disks to rub off.</p>
<p>It is best if your octopus has been frozen which tenderizes it to some 
extent. Refreezing won't hurt either,</p>

<ol>
<li>Octopus sold in Southern California markets is already cleaned but if 
yours isn't, make a cut under the back of the head where it joins the 
body and pull out all the innards, turning the head inside out as needed. 
Force the beak back from the center of the tentacle star until you can cut 
it out and cut out the eyes.<p></p></li>

<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil - it needs to be deep because of the 
way the octopus will curl up. In Italy where much octopus is cooked 
they put one or two wine corks in the water to help tenderize the beasts. 
There's no scientific explanation for this and I know of no rigorous 
testing, but I have the corks so I toss 'em in. In other octopus 
intensive areas they put in half an onion so I toss that in too.
<p></p></li>
<li>Put the octopus in the boiling water and watch it curl up. Bring the 
water back to a boil quickly and simmer for as long as it takes. You can test 
doneness by inserting the point of a small skewer through the thickest part 
of a tentacle. When the point goes through without finding rubbery resistance 
at the center it's done. Here's my test results from a 2-1/2 pound octopus.

  </table>
<p></p></li>
<li>If you cook to the "Tender enough" point, leaving the skin and sucker 
disks on (my recommendation), the skin will become firmer and adhere better 
when the tentacles have cooled. Octopus gets a bit stiff and has less flavor 
when chilled so you always want to bring it to room temperature for 
serving.</li>
