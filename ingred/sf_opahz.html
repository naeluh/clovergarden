 This very large pelagic fish is found worldwide in tropical and temperate 
waters, most commonly at about 1200 feet depth, but down to 1600 feet. It 
is the only known full body warm blooded fish. It is often caught as 
by-catch in deep water Tuna fisheries, but there is currently no 
established market for it, so most is wasted. The U.S. National Marine 
Fisheries Service has issued grants to build a commercial market for 
this fish, as it is considered an excellent eating fish. This fish is 
IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

<p>A sushi chef using Opah says, "It's like seven fish in one". 
The Abductor Muscle behind the head is red meat similar to that of 
land animals. The Top Loin is red-orange and similar to Ahi Tuna. 
Some have called it like a cross between Tuna and Salmon. The Belly 
meat is pink, fatty and particularly good for grilling or roasting. 
The bones make and excellent fish stock.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Opah Top Loin and Opah Belly are available 
from Catalina Offshore Products - <u>when they have it in stock</u>. 
They have been granted funds by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries 
Service to promote this fish, but supply is still erratic (late 
2018).</p>
