[Butterfish (Asian Market - wrong); <i>Piaractus mesopotamicus</i> 
(fb Pacu) &nbsp; | &nbsp;  similar <i>Colossoma macropomum</i> 
(fb Cachama)]
<p>
Native to the rivers of South America, these fish are of the Piranha 
family (yes, they can bite), and related to Carp and Milkfish at the 
superorder level. The photo specimen was found in the frozen fish cases 
of a large Asian market here in Los Angeles, labeled "Butterfish", 
though it is entirely unrelated to the Butterfish family or to any 
other fish so called.</p>
<p><i>P.mesopotamicus</i> can grow to 21 inches and 44 pounds, but the 
largest specimen I have purchased was 12-3/4 inches long and weighed 1 
pound 12-3/4 ounces. <i>C. macropomum</i> looks a lot like 
<i>P. mesopotamicus</i> but has very wide gill covers and can get up to 
42 inches and 88 pounds. Both species are farmed, as is 
<a href="sf_pacurbz.html"><i>Piaractus brachypomus</i></a> also. All 
three are considered non-threatened (though threatening).</p>

<p>There are stories of these fish mistaking the testicles of skinny 
dipping men for their normal food, biting off said danglies, with 
sometimes fatal results. Others say these stories are not true, but 
a large pacu certainly could do that (see teeth, photo at left).</p>

<p>The flesh of this fish is firm, medium flavored and pleasant. There is 
a small dark strip down the center under the skin which tastes just a bit 
oily, but not unpleasantly so.  The flesh holds together well in all forms 
of cooking and can be cooked skin-on or skin-off. The belly, thin on most 
fish, is thick, stiff and fatty, as it is on a milkfish.</p>

<p>On the downside, there are scattered branching spines in the flesh, as 
in most other Carp related fish. There is no way to remove them, so they 
must be dealt with on the plate and in the mouth. While this is not a 
problem for most of the world, Americans are not accustomed to dealing 
with these, so are missing out on some very delicious fish.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; One large Asian market here in Los Angeles had 
a good supply of these in the frozen fish cases, made up in trays of two 
fish each - but mislabeled "Butterfish". This was in mid 2011, but I 
haven't found any since.
</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with tiny but 
rather stiff scales that take a lot of energy to remove. Normal scraping 
won't work - the entire fish has to be shaved with the sharp edge of a 
strong prep knife, working vigorously and from various angles. This is 
about as hard to scale as fish come. On the other hand, if cooking a 
whole fish, you could probably cook it scales on and then peel off the 
skin after cooking. </p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish has a hard keel running from the head 
back to the anal fin, so you can't cut straight into the belly. There is 
also a hard ridge at the top from the head to the dorsal fin.  Easiest is 
to cut off the head. Pull it straight forward and just about all the 
innards pull off with it. Split the belly on both sides of the keel back to 
the vent (just in front of the anal fin) with kitchen shears. If you need 
the fish head-on, knife cut on both sides of the keel from chin to vent 
and pull it out with long nose pliers, including the pelvic fins. This 
will give you easy access to the body cavity, which is large and filled 
with stiff fat deposits. Pull the gills with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish fillets very nicely and has an easy to 
follow bone structure. Cut along both sides of the anal fin and across 
the tail. From the front back, cut down to the backbone, than over the 
backbone at the tail and work forward to the body cavity. Cut the ribs 
from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with 
long nose pliers. They are many and long, but pull out fairly easily, 
taking little flesh. There are scattered spines in the flesh, but they 
are too fragile to pull and stuck in hard.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 12-3/4 ounce fish yielded 13-1/2 ounces 
of fillet skin-on (47%) and 12-1/8 ounces skin-off (42%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor. Cooked it 
is a little gelatinous. Slowly heated as in steaming or baked the skin 
actually expands, so no cuts through it are needed. Pan fried, shrink is 
fairly severe, but the skin very soon blisters away from the flesh and the 
fillet can be gently patted down flat. For poaching it is best to use  
skinless fillet. The skin will curl the fillet into a roll upon hitting 
the poaching liquid, though it will then relax and the fillet can be 
flattened. Raw, the skin is very tough and can be removed cleanly and 
easily using the standard long knife <a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads, bones and fins, simmered slowly for 40 
minutes, make a light, nearly clear and very serviceable stock.</p>
