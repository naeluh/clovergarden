<p>American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi / Missouri / Ohio 
drainage basin north of Arkansas. They can grow to over 7 feet and 200 
pounds but are commonly 48 inches long. They have recently been found 
in the Danube, probably escaped from fish farms during floods, and have 
been seen in restaurant holding tanks in southern China. Chinese paddlefish 
were native to rivers in northern China and grew to nearly 10 feet and 
660 pounds. They are now thought extinct due to dam building, pollution 
and over harvesting. The American paddlefish is IUCN rated VU 
(Vulnerable) but are still allowed as a sports fish in many locations.

<p>While still fairly common, the American Paddlefish is under 
serious pressure from poachers due to a criminal market for it's caviar. 
This caviar is shipped to Russia and reshipped by Russian crime 
syndicates mislabeled as Russian Caviar. Unfortunately, the Russians 
learned everything they know about Capitalism from B grade gangster 
flicks. In 2013 more than 100 people were rounded up and arrested or 
given federal citations for participating in a paddlefish poaching 
ring.</p>

<p>Unlike their cousins, the Sturgeons, Paddlefish are plankton eaters, 
cruising around with their big mouths open to scoop up microscopic and 
near microscopic prey. Electrical sensors on their paddle alert them 
to the presence of prey. They are now extinct in Lake Erie and its 
drainages and cannot be restored there because of the invasive zebra 
mussels. These are also filter feeders and keep the water too cleaned 
of plankton for paddlefish to have enough to eat. Unfortunately the 
equally invasive round gobies aren't eating enough zebra mussels to 
clear them out.</p>

<h2>Paddlefish Caviar</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_cavpad01c.jpg" alt="Paddlefish 'Caviar'" class=mrg>
This fish is related to the sturgeon, and produces Caviar that is quite 
similar, and is allowed by U.S. regulations to be labeled as Caviar. It 
is a bit smaller than Sturgeon caviar, smoother in texture, and the eggs 
have a bit less "pop". Color varies from steel gray to brownish gray. 
Given the high price of sturgeon caviar, there is considerable interest 
in farming this fish, both for meat and eggs, but also "ranching" them 
(stocking reservoirs where they feed themselves). Paddlefish caviar 
sells on-line for around 2016 US $24 per ounce, plus overnight shipping.

<h2>Paddlefish Meat</h2> 
<br>The flesh of paddlefish has a texture much more like pork than like 
like regular fish.  It is well liked in the region where paddlefish are 
are native, and appreciated for being boneless. Study is underway on 
the economic viability of paddlefish aquaculture for meat.<p></p>
