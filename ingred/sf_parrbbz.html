The name "Blue-barred" is a bit deceptive, because only very young 
fish have the three blue bars. This fish ranges throughout the 
Red Sea and Indian Ocean, down to South Africa, and also in the 
Pacific as far north as southern Japan, all through Indonesia and 
as far east as the Gulf of California, and down to Ecuador.</p>
<p>These fish can grow to almost 36 inches (TL), but the photo specimen 
was 18-1/4 inches long and weighed 3.33 pounds. This Parrotfish is 
fished commercially in various regions, and is IUCN Red Listed LC 
(Least Concern) - but their numbers are critically important to the 
health of Coral Reefs.</p>

<p>As you can see below, Parrotfish is a little more hassle than 
some fish to prepare, so why deal with Parrotfish? Well, because they 
have a unique combination of taste and texture. Parrotfish flesh is 
pure white in color, with no dark strip down the center under the skin. 
It's flavor is mild, but sufficiently interesting to be enjoyed by the 
fish connoisseur - yet not so assertive as to offend those who want 
their fish "white and lite".</p>

<p>The flesh stays firm enough for any mode of cooking, but on the plate, 
can be flaked apart into unusually thick firm textured flakes.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish needs to be cooked as skinless 
fillets, as its skin shrink is too severe to be controlled. For pan 
frying, I use just a dusting of rice flour and fry in a light oil so 
the true taste of the fish can be enjoyed. It also poaches very well. 
In both cases, use a very light sauce. This fish cooks firm enough it 
can be used in fish soups and stews.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Parrotfish show up fairly regularly in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Southern California and occasionally 
in other Asian markets. It's not a fish you go out to buy, it's a fish 
you buy when you see it. The photo specimen, 3 pounds, 5-1/4 ounces, 
was purchased from a Philippine fish market in Los Angeles for 2015 US 
$3.99 / pound.</p> 

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with very 
large, stiff scales that have a lot of tight overlap, making them 
difficult to scrape off, and impossible to scrape off on a larger fish. 
For a 3-1/2 pound fish I had to pull them off in clumps with my long 
nose pliers and fingers. Fortunately, they were so big (1-1/2 inches 
wide), that there weren't that many of them.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to clean as 
there are some tough membranes that aren't easy to pull out, and the 
gills are hard to get to. Use your long nosed pliers. You will find 
a set of millstones in the throat, used to crush coral pebbles into 
sand to extract food.</p>
 
<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The fish is fairly easy to fillet with an easy 
to follow bone structure. When you get to the rib cage, it is easiest 
to cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet. Pulled lengthwise they slip out easily taking almost no flesh 
with them. There are some substantial sharp centerline pinbones for the 
full length of the rib cage. Pull these out straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks very severely when heated, it 
doesn't let go, and it doesn't soften until the damage is done. Trying 
to hold a fillet flat when it's turned skin side down is futile, the 
skin just pulls the fillet into a lump. Fortunately, the skin is tough, 
enough to be easily removed cleanly using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skin does not 
have a strong or "off" flavor, but I do not use it in the stock pot 
because it will color the stock oddly.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is moderate due to the large head and 
heavy structure. A 3 pound 5-1/2 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 6-1/2 
ounces of skin-on fillet (42%) and 20 ounces skin off (38%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a fairly clear 
light flavored stock with almost no oil at all. It may have some color 
even if the skins are not used. For details see our
