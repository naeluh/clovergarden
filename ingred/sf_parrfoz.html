[Forsten's Parrotfish, <i>Scarus forsteni</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the Western Pacific, around the Philippines, 
Indonesia, northern Australia, and as far east as the Pitcairn Island 
group. It can grow to almost 22 inches (TL) and 5-1/2 pounds, but the 
photo specimen was 12-3/4 inches long and weighed 1.1 pounds.</p>
<p>These fish are fished commercially in the region, and are IUCN Red 
Listed LC (Least Concern) - but their numbers are critically important 
to the health of Coral Reefs.<p>

<p>As you can see below, Parrotfish is a little more hassle than 
some fish to prepare, so why deal with Parrotfish? Well, because they 
have a unique combination of taste and texture. Parrotfish flesh is 
pure white in color, with no dark strip down the center under the skin. 
It's flavor is mild, but sufficiently interesting to be enjoyed by the 
fish connoisseur - yet not so assertive as to offend those who want 
their fish "white and lite".</p>

<p>The flesh stays firm enough for any mode of cooking, but on the plate, 
can be flaked apart into unusually thick firm textured flakes. The 
heads, bones, fins and skins make a very good, fairly mild stock, 
suitable for soups and stews. This fish cannot be cooked skin-on.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Parrotfish show up fairly regularly in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Southern California, and occasionally 
in other Asian markets. It's not a fish you go out to buy, it's a fish 
you buy when you see it. Cost is usually  around 2016 US $3.99 / pound.
</p> 

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with very 
large stiff scales that have a lot of tight overlap, making them 
difficult to scrape off, and they fly around a lot as you do. For a 
larger fish (more than 2 pounds) you will have to pull the scales off 
in clumps with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to clean as 
there are some tough membranes that aren't easy to pull out, and the 
gills are hard to get to. Use your long nosed pliers.</p>
 
<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The fish is fairly easy to fillet with an easy 
to follow bone structure. When you get to the rib cage, it is easiest 
to cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet. Pulled lengthwise they slip out easily taking no flesh with 
them. There are some substantial sharp centerline pinbones for the full 
length of the rib cage. Pull these out straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks very severely when heated, it 
doesn't let go, and it doesn't soften until the damage is done. Trying 
to hold a fillet flat when it's turned skin side down is futile, the 
skin just pulls the fillet into a lump. Fortunately, the skin is tough, 
enough to be easily removed cleanly using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skin does not 
have a strong or "off" flavor, but I do not use it in the stock pot 
because it will color the stock oddly.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 3oz (1.2 pound) fish yielded 8 ounces 
of skinless fillet (42%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a moderately 
flavored stock with almost no oil at all. For details see our
