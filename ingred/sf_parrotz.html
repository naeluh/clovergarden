<h1>Parrotfish Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_parrot08g.jpg" alt="Whole Blue-barred Parrotfish" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Scarus</i> of family <i>Scaridae</i>]
<p>
Parrotfish are a fairly large family of at least 10 genera, found in reef 
environments in the Indo-Pacific region and also the Caribbean region. 
They are of critical importance to the reef environment, because they 
clean the coral of algae and sponges on both the sea side and the land 
side. Only a few species are fished commercially.</p>

<p>Identification of parrotfish species is very difficult. They change 
face and tail shape with maturity, and change from dull colored female 
to bright colored male at a particular length. Their colors and patterns 
seem to be whatever the individual fish wants. For instance, the Red 
Parrotfish is seen in all bright red, but also in all blue. Patterns 
a fish is named for may not be seen in all individuals. My 
identifications below are the best I could do, and I think they are 
pretty good, but don't depend on them absoltely. Fortunately, it makes 
little difference as far as eating them is concerned.</p>

<p><h3>Please Note:</h3> &nbsp; While few Parrot Fish are IUCN rated 
Endangered, they have all been found extremely important to the health 
of Coral Reefs, which are almost universally rated "Endangered". So far, 
only one island in the Caribbean has made it illegal to harm Parrot 
Fish (they are almost always taken by spear fishers) but other 
governments are seriously considering this move. The more Parrot Fish, 
the better for Coral Reefs, and their numbers have been seriously 
reduced in the Carribean, Australia, and other regions. Best not to 
eat them.<p></p>

<h2>Forsten's Parrotfish</h2>

<img src="img/sf_parrot03e.jpg" alt="Parrotfish" class=mrg></a>
[Mol-mol, Mul-mul (Philippines); <i>Scarus forsteni</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the Western Pacific, around the Philippines, 
Indonesia, northern Australia, and as far east as the Pitcairn Island 
group. It can grow to almost 22 inches and 5-1/2 pounds, but the 
photo specimen was 12-3/4 inches long and weighed 1.1 pounds. 
It is fished commercially in the region, and is IUCN Red Listed 
LC (Least Concern).

<h2>Blue-barred Parrotfish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_parrbbz.html">
<img src="img/sf_parrot08e.jpg" alt="Parrotfish" class=mrg></a>
[Mol-mol, Mul-mu, Loro, Luro (Philippines); <i>Scarus ghobban</i>]
<p>
The name "Blue-barred" is a bit deceptive, because only very young 
fish have the three blue bars. This fish ranges throughout the 
Red Sea and Indian Ocean, down to South Africa, and also in the 
Pacific as far north as southern Japan, all through Indonesia and 
as far east as the Gulf of California, and down to Ecuador. 
It can grow to almost 36 inches, but the photo specimen was 18-1/4 
inches long and weighed 3.33 pounds. This Parrotfish is fished 
commercially in various regions, and is IUCN Red Listed LC (Least 
Concern).

<h2>Singapore Parrotfish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_parrspz.html">
<img src="img/sf_parrot12e.jpg" alt="Whole Singapore Parrotfish" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Scarus prasiognathos</i>]
<p>
These Indo-West Pacific fish are found in reef environments, mainly 
in the West Pacific, but some are found as far west as the Maldives. 
They are not usually all blue like the photo specimen. They range as 
far north as the Ryukyu Islands, as far south as the northern tip of 
Australia, and all through Indonesia and around Papua New Guinea. 
They can grow to almost 28 inches, but the photo specimen was 14-1/8 
inches long and weighed 1 pound 13-3/8 ounces.  This Parrotfish is 
fished commercially, and is IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).

<h2>Ember Parrotfish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_parrebz.html">
<img src="img/sf_parrot15e.jpg" alt="Whole Ember Parrotfish 15e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Scarus rubroviolaceus</i>]
<p>
These Indo-Pacific fish have a very wide range, found in reef and 
rocky environments from Durban, South Africa to the Ryukyu islands 
of Japan, the Hawaiian Islands, the Gulf of California and the 
Galapagos Islands. They range as far south as the northern coast of 
Australia. They can grow to almost 28 inches, but the photo specimen 
was 20-1/4 inches long and weighed 2 pounds 15-3/4 ounces. They change 
from female to male at 14-3/4 inches long and develop a bulbous nose 
and often a deeply lunate tail. Color schemes and patterns can vary 
radically. This Parrotfish is fished commercially, and is IUCN Red 
Listed LC (Least Concern).

<h2>Rivulated Parrotfish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_parrrvz.html">
<img src="img/sf_parrot20e.jpg" alt="Whole Rivulated Parrotfish 20e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Scarus rivulatus</i>]
<p>
These West-Pacific fish are found in reef environments from 
Sri Lanka to New Caledonia and Tonga, north to the Ryukyu Islands, 
Japan, and south to New South Wales, Australia. These fish can grow to 
about 18 inches (TL), but the photo specimen was 13-5/8 inches long 
and weighed 1 pound 8-1/4 ounces.  Color schemes and patterns can vary 
radically. Young female fish are gray, but when they get larger and 
turn male they get a color scheme something like in the photo. The 
other fish packaged with this one was nearly black. This Parrotfish 
is fished commercially, and is IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).
