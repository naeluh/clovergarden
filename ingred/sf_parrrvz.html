[<i>Scarus rivulatus</i>]
<p>
These West-Pacific fish are found in reef environments from 
Sri Lanka to New Caledonia and Tonga, north to the Ryukyu Islands, 
Japan, and south to New South Wales, Australia. These fish can grow to 
about 18 inches (TL), but the photo specimen was 13-5/8 inches long 
and weighed 1 pound 8-1/4 ounces.</p>
<p>Color schemes and patterns can vary radically. Young female fish are 
gray, but when they get larger and turn male they get a color scheme 
something like in the photo. The other fish packaged with this one was 
nearly black. This Parrotfish is fished commercially, and is IUCN 
Red Listed LC (Least Concern)  - but their numbers are critically 
important to the health of Coral Reefs.</p>

<p>As you can see below, Parrotfish is a little more hassle than 
some fish to prepare, so why deal with Parrotfish? Well, because they 
have a unique combination of taste and texture. Parrotfish flesh is 
pure white in color, with no dark strip down the center under the skin. 
It's flavor is mild, but sufficiently interesting to be enjoyed by the 
fish connoisseur - yet not so assertive as to deeply offend those who 
want their fish "white and lite".</p>

<p>The flesh stays firm enough for any mode of cooking, but on the 
plate, can be flaked apart into unusually thick firm textured flakes. 
</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish needs to be cooked as skinless 
fillets, as its skin shrink is too severe to be controlled. For pan 
frying, I use just a dusting of rice flour and fry in a light oil so 
the true taste of the fish can be enjoyed. It also poaches very well. 
In both cases, use a very light sauce. This fish cooks firm enough it 
can be used in fish soups and stews.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Parrotfish show up fairly regularly in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Southern California, and a little less 
commonly in other Asian markets. It's not a fish you go out to buy, 
it's a fish you buy when you see it. The photo specimen, 1 pound 8-1/4 
ounces, was purchased from the freezer cases (pack of 2) from an Asian 
market (Viet / Chinese) in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US $2.99 
/ pound.</p> 

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with very 
large, stiff scales that have a lot of very tight overlap and fairly 
strong adhesion, but they are flexible enough to be scraped off with 
some effort, though you may need to pull a few with long nose pliers. 
They will fly around a lot.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to clean as 
there are some tough membranes that aren't easy to pull out, and the 
gills are hard to get to. Use your long nosed pliers. You will find 
a set of millstones in the throat, used to crush coral pebbles into 
sand to extract food.</p>
 
<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is fairly easy to fillet, with an 
easy to follow bone structure. When you get to the rib cage, it is 
easiest to cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull 
them from the fillet. Pulled lengthwise they pull out easily taking 
almost no flesh with them. There are some substantial sharp centerline 
pinbones for the full length of the rib cage. Pull these out straight 
forward. The lower belly is very thin and lined with soft fat. Best 
to cut the thin part off to make skinning easier.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks very severely when heated, it 
doesn't let go, and it doesn't soften until the damage is done. Trying 
to hold a fillet flat when it's turned skin side down is futile, the 
skin just pulls the fillet into a lump. Fortunately, the skin is tough, 
enough to be easily removed cleanly using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skin does not 
have a strong or "off" flavor, but I do not use it in the stock pot 
because it will color the stock oddly.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is a bit better than some parrotfish. 
A 1 pound 8-1/4 ounce fish yielded 10 ounces of skin-on fillet 
(41%) and 8.3/4 ounces skin off (36%). Yield is a bit low because 
the head is large compared to the body.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a stock with 
almost no oil, but it has a greenish color, is a little murky, and 
I'm not real fond of the flavor.</p>
