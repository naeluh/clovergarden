[<i>Scarus prasiognathos</i>]
<p>
These Indo-West Pacific fish are found in reef environments, mainly 
in the West Pacific, but some are found as far west as the Maldives. 
They are not usually all blue like the photo specimen, and the big 
patch on the chin is usually green in adult males. They range as 
far north as the Ryukyu Islands, as far south as the northern tip of 
Australia, and all through Indonesia and around Papua New Guinea.</p> 
<p>These fish can grow to almost 28 inches (TL), but the photo specimen 
was 14-1/8 inches long and weighed 1 pound 13-3/8 ounces.  This 
Parrotfish is fished commercially, and is IUCN Red Listed LC (Least 
Concern) - but their numbers are critically important to the health 
of Coral Reefs.

<p>As you can see below, Parrotfish is a little more hassle than 
some fish to prepare, so why deal with Parrotfish? Well, because they 
have a unique combination of taste and texture. Parrotfish flesh is 
pure white in color, with no dark strip down the center under the skin. 
It's flavor is mild, but sufficiently interesting to be enjoyed by the 
fish connoisseur - yet not so assertive as to deeply offend those who 
want their fish "white and lite".</p>

<p>The flesh stays firm enough for any mode of cooking, but on the 
plate, can be flaked apart into unusually thick firm textured flakes. 
</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish needs to be cooked as skinless 
fillets, as its skin shrink is too severe to be controlled. For pan 
frying, I use just a dusting of rice flour and fry in a light oil so 
the true taste of the fish can be enjoyed. It also poaches very well. 
In both cases, use a very light sauce. This fish cooks firm enough it 
can be used in fish soups and stews.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Parrotfish show up fairly regularly in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Southern California and occasionally 
in other Asian markets. It's not a fish you go out to buy, it's a fish 
you buy when you see it. The photo specimen, 1 pound 13-3/8 ounces, 
was purchased from a Philippine fish market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) 
for 2016 US $3.99 / pound.</p> 

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with very 
large stiff scales that have a lot of tight overlap, making them 
difficult to scrape off, and impossible to scrape off on a larger 
fish. For a 1-7/8 pound fish I had to pull them off in clumps with 
my long nose pliers and fingers. Fortunately, they are so big that 
there aren't that many of them.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to clean as 
there are some tough membranes that aren't easy to pull out, and the 
gills are hard to get to. Use your long nosed pliers and strong 
kitchen shears. You will find a set of millstones in the throat, used 
to crush coral pebbles into sand to extract food.</p>
 
<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The fish is fairly easy to fillet with an easy 
to follow bone structure. When you get to the rib cage, it is easiest 
to cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet. Pulled lengthwise they pull out taking little flesh with 
them. There are some substantial sharp centerline pinbones for the 
full length of the rib cage. Pull these out straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks very severely when heated, it 
doesn't let go, and it doesn't soften until the damage is done. Trying 
to hold a fillet flat when it's turned skin side down is futile, the 
skin just pulls the fillet into a lump. Fortunately, the skin is tough, 
enough to be easily removed cleanly using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skin does not 
have a strong or "off" flavor, but I do not use it in the stock pot 
because it will color the stock oddly.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is a bit better than some parrotfish. 
A 2 pound 15-3/4 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 3 ounces of skin-on fillet 
(40%) and 1 pound 1/4 ounce skin off (34%). Yield is a bit low due to 
the large heavy head.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a light 
flavored stock with almost no oil, but the stock will be distinctly 
green in color. For details see our
