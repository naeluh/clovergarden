<h1>Crab Pastes / Sauces</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
While not used as widely as Shrimp Pastes / Sauces, Crab Pastes / 
Sauces are very important in Vietnam, Laos and Issan Thailand. Some 
forms are easily available in Asian markets, usually from Thailand, 
but the one most important in Laos and Issan you need to make yourself. 
Fortunately, the ingredients are now available in North America, though 
frozen rather than live.  Instructions will be found below.</p>

<h2>Philippine Crab Paste</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_cbpaste02h.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Philippine Crab Paste" class=mrg>
[Taba ng Talangka, Aligue (Philippine)]
<p>This product is made from the eggs (roe) of tiny crabs, which are 
inexplicably called "crab fat" in the Philippines. It is a very popular 
condiment / sauce used im various ways, especially on appetizers and in 
sauces for rice and pasta recipes. It definitely has the taste of crab 
eggs, not of fat. It takes countless thousands of tiny female crabs to 
produce this paste, but there is no shortage of the crabs in Southeast 
Asia.</p>
<p>Razon's <i>Aligue</i> and Navarro's <i>Taba ng Talangka 100%</i> 
are prferred brands in the Philippines, but the brand available here in 
Los Angeles is Tropica, which is a 100% brand. It is also distributed 
in San Francisco. Keep it refrigerated at all times. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a large Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) 
for 2019 US $4.69 for an 8 ounce jar. Ingred: "crab fat", soya oil, 
palm vinegar, pepper, annatto seed extract, FD&C Yellow #6 (Sunset 
Yellow).

<h2>Thai Crab Paste</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp06h.jpg" alt="Small Bowl of Crab Paste with Oil" class=mrg>
[Gach Cua Xao Dau An]
<p>
This is a typical Thai crab paste by a leading Thai brand, 
Pantai. According to the label, the crabs were caught in the Pacific 
ocean. The bits of crab in the paste were surprisingly firm.
&nbsp;  Ingr: Crab meat (60%), soya bean oil (28%), garlic, salt, pepper, 
flavor enhancers (monosodium glutamate E621, disodium 5'inosinate E631, 
disodium 5'guanylate E627) color (paprika oleoresin E160c)

<h2 class=lrg>Paddy Crab Pastes / Sauces</h2>

<p>In Laos and the Issan region of Thailand, the rice paddies are 
infested with tiny freshwater crabs. They are disliked by farmers, 
because they eat young rice shoots. They are hard to get rid of because, 
when the paddies are dry, they just tunnel into the mud and hibernate 
until the water returns. On the other hand, they do provide a significant 
supplementary income for the rice farmers. The crabs are captured, salted 
and ground up into a seasoning paste that is well liked in Laos, 
Northeastern Thailand, and southern Vietnam. This paste is usually 
locally made and isn't much available in North America. These crabs are 
also sold fresh and unsalted for use in Vietnam's famous Bun Rieu Cua 
soup.</p>

<h2>Rice Crab Sauce for Bun Reiu Soup</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabs02c.jpg" alt="Commercial Bun Reiu Sauce" class=mrg>
<p>[Gia Vi Cua Nau Bun Rieu (Viet)]
</p><p>
So important is the Bun Rieu Soup, mentioned above, that pre-made sauces 
are exported for use by Vietnamese in other countries where the raw 
ingredients are hard to find. This sauce was made in Thailand, rather 
than Vietnam, but this is reasonable. Thailand is a major manufacturer 
of canned and bottled sauces and similar products for export, while 
Vietnam is more known for exporting whole natural products. Ingred: 
Water, onion, crab meat (18%), garlic, soybean oil, peanut, lemon 
grass, chili, sugar, modified cornstarch E1422, monosodium glutamate 
E621, salt, paprika natural color E160c.

<h2>Rice Crab Sauce</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp20h.jpg" alt="Commercial Crab Sauce" class=mrg>
[Nuoc Cot Cua Dong (Viet)]
<p>
This is a commercial product that recently showed up in the same freezer 
case with the whole crabs and chopped crabs with sauce that were used 
in the development described below. The white plastic tub held 1-1/2 cups. 
Of that, 1-1/4 cup was water (83% water), and 1/4 cup was sediment, about 
half very fine and half somewhat gritty. Made in Vietnam, Ing: Crab, 
pure water. In my opinion, my homemade sauce is superior.

<h2 class=lrg id=paste>Making Rice Crab Pastes / Sauces</h2>

<p>I've found incomplete information on making these pastes. I suppose 
the writers expect an English speaker would not want to do this and/or 
be unable to get the ingredients. Having studied everything I've found, 
I believe my procedures are adequately accurate, and I have made these 
pastes and sauces.</p>
<p>So, you ask, what does it taste like? In my opinion it tastes pretty 
good - fairly inoffensive, and definitely more crab flavored than similar 
murky fish sauces. My office assistant noticed a sort of "fishy" smell 
when I was concentrating the Laotian paste, but didn't find it 
objectionable.

   <h2>Rice Paddy Crab</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_cbpads03e.jpg" alt="Salted Paddy Crab, whole" class=mrg>
   [Boo Kem, Bpoo Kem (Thai, salted); Ba Kh&iacute;a Nguy&eacute;n Con 
   (Vietnam, salted)]
   <p>
   This is a salted rice paddy crab. I bought a tray with 14 ounces of 
   them from the freezer cases of a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
   (San Gabriel), 2017 US $3.56 / pound. They are up to 1-3/4 inches 
   across the shell. For use in Green Papaya Salad and the like, the 
   top shell is pried off and discarded along with the gills under it. 
   The rest of the crab is broken up and added to the salad. For pastes 
   and sauces, the whole crab is ground up. For details see our 
   <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_cbpadz.html"><b>Rice Paddy Crabs</b></a> page. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Frozen Minced Crab</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp07h.jpg" alt="Chopped up Paddy Crabs" class=mrg>
   [Ba Khia]
   <p>
   Some weeks after I bought the whole frozen salted crabs, the market 
   added 14 ounce tubs of "Frozen Minced Crab" to the same freezer case, 
   2017 US $3.41 / pound. "Minced" is hardly the word,  they were just 
   very coarsely hacked apart as they would be for salads. These were 
   from Vietnam, and had quite a bit of sauce (or salad dressing) 
   included. Ing: Crab, water, salt, sugar, chili, garlic, vinegar. 
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h3>Decisions</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>The tub of chopped crab didn't look to be enough for paste, and 
       there was too much sauce - so I decided to grind together the 14 
       ounce tub and the 14 ounces of whole crabs.</li>
     <li> Suggestion: Use heavy wire cutters or similar to cut off the 
       white teeth from inside the claws. They are extremely hard and 
       difficult to grind.</li>
     <li>You need a powerful high speed blender for the grinding. A 
       food processor just doesn't have what it takes. An Indian 
       wet grinder (used to grind rice for idli cakes) would probably 
       be ideal, but those are scarce and expensive in North America.
       </li>
     <li>In Laos the Crabs are pounded with Lemon Grass and Guava 
       Leaves (<i>Mak Sida</i> - from real guavas, not pineapple 
       guavas).  Lacking Guava Leaves, I decided to just use the liquid 
       sauce from the tub of chopped crabs for flavoring, though there 
       wasn't enough to make much difference. I certainly could have 
       added Lemon Grass, but decided to leave that to be added to 
       recipes separately.</li>
       </ul>


   <h3>Grinding</h3>
   <br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp13h.jpg" alt="Ground Paddy Crabs" class=mrg>
   In Laos, the crabs would be pounded in a mortar, a project taking a 
   lot of time and energy, so I used mechanical means. The specimen to the 
   left in this paragraph was ground in a powerful food processor, but 
   was just too gritty, so it had to be reground in a blender. As the 
   blender grinds, you will need to add more and more water so it doesn't 
   bog down and get overloaded. Smoke coming from the blender base is 
   not a good sign. The resulting paste will always be a little gritty, 
   but the grit should be very fine. Commercial products are a bit finer, 
   but still gritty.
   <br class=cll><p></p>
   
   <h3>In Vietnam</h3>
   <br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp09h.jpg" alt="Liquid from Ground Paddy Crabs" class=mrg>
   <img src="img/sf_pdcrabp11h.jpg" alt="Solids from Ground Paddy Crabs" class=mrg>
   In Vietnam and parts of Thailand, this is as far as the process might 
   go. The loose paste is strained to produce a liquid sauce (left photo), 
   and the finely ground debris (right photo) is often used to make crab 
   cakes. I wrung out the photo example in a strong muslin bag, making a 
   very fine liquid with no grittiness, but strainers not quite so fine 
   may also be used.
   <p>The difference from making the broth for Bun Rieu 
   soup in Vietnam is that fresh crabs are used rather than salted and 
   frozen. Salted and frozen are the only ones we can get in North 
   America (California rice growers are <u>very</u> adverse to having 
   these crabs in their paddies). You could desalt the crabs by soaking, 
   but Unsalted crab juice needs to be used right away as it will spoil 
   quickly.
   <br class=cll></p> 

   <h3>In Laos <small>and</small> Issan Thailand</h3>
   <br><img src="img/sf_pdcrabp16h.jpg" alt="Partially Dehydrated Paddy Crab Paste" class=mrg>
   [Nam Bpo]
   <p>
   In the countryside it is desired to have a crab paste that will last 
   a long time without refrigeration, as the crabs are not readily 
   available much of the year. For this reason, the ground crab paste 
   is allowed to ferment overnight, then cooked <u>very slowly</u> in 
   kitchen embers for about 24 hours, or until most of the water has 
   evaporated and the paste is dark and very stiff.</p>
   <p>Not having kitchen embers available, I put the paste in an 
   open saut&eacute; pan and cooked over very low heat, stirring often 
   and carefully regulating the temperature. It should be kept above 
   165&deg;F/75&deg;C, but below 205&deg;F/95&deg;C. If it goes 
   much above 205&deg;F in the early going it will bubble and splatter 
   without mercy, and in the later going it might burn. The object here 
   is not to fry the paste, but to dehydrate it. It should be a dark, 
   rather stiff paste, but should be taken off the heat and packed 
   before it becomes so dry it breaks up into crumbs. With precise 
   temperature control and frequent stirring it should take less than 
   6 hours. Kept in a sealed container, the paste needs no refrigeration. 
   My paste didn't come out nearly as dark as it often does in Laotian 
   homes, probably because of very precise temperature control.
