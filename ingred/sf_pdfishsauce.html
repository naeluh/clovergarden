<h1>Fish Sauces</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Fish sauce is made by packing small fish and/or fish blood 
and innards into large barrels or jars layered with salt, and setting the 
barrels out in the hot sun for around a year. The fish is digested by its 
own digestive enzymes and a clear salty liquid is eventually drained off 
and bottled. It is quite essential to several cuisines, particularly 
those of Southeast Asia today and of the Roman Empire in the past.
</span><p></p>

<span class=bg>Today, fish sauce is an important component of the "Pacific Rim Cuisine" 
rooted in Southern California, and is slowly entering the North American 
mainstream, particularly through innovative chefs who have found it a 
wonderful flavoring ingredient.</span>

   <h2 id="rome">Roman Fish Sauces</h2>
   <p>
   <img src="img/sf_pdcoin01c.jpg" alt="Roman Coin" class=mrg>
   Fish sauce was so important to the cuisine of the Roman Empire that 
   almost all known Roman recipes call for it. People attempting to 
   recreate dishes from those times often suggest substituting anchovy 
   paste, an ingredient certain to ruin the dish entirely - then tell 
   you it must be "an acquired taste".</p>
   <p>Actually, quite suitable fish sauces made by methods very similar to 
   those of ancient Rome are easily available in any market catering to a 
   Southeast Asian community. Also, a fish sauce called 
   <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html#colat">Colatura di Alici</a> is produced in Italy today, 
   though it's more concentrated than the original Roman or Southeast 
   Asian products.</p>
   <p>Originally, a fish sauce called "garos" was brought from Greece to 
   Rome. The Romans took to it and established factories to produce it in 
   quantity. This became a major industry, particularly in Spain, just as 
   it is in Thailand and Vietnam today. Some fish sauce was still being 
   made in Spain during Moorish times. Whether there is any connection 
   between the Greek fish sauce and Southeast Asian products can not be 
   known, but the naturalness of its development from salt preserving 
   fish requires no such technology transfer.</p>
   <p>The basic difference between the Roman fish sauce and the current 
   Thai product is the Thai practice of using only fresh whole anchovies. 
   The Romans sometimes used other fish and enhanced the mix with extra 
   fish blood and guts, or for higher grades may have used mostly the 
   blood and guts. This would produce a faster fermenting product of 
   higher concentration. Note that in southern Thailand a fish sauce 
   called <b>Tai pla</b> is made entirely from mackerel entrails - and 
   it is definitely stronger than regular Thai fish sauce.</p>

   <p>The Romans had different grades of fish sauces and used several 
   names for them. To the best of current knowledge this is how it shakes 
   out: </p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>Garum:</b> &nbsp; A high grade fish sauce made from the guts 
       and blood of a single kind of fish, generally anchovies, mullet or 
       mackerel. <u>Subst:</u> use a premium brand Thai fish sauce like 
       Squid or Tra Chang.</li>
     <li><b>Liquamen:</b> &nbsp; This name appears in the 4th century CE 
       and detailed recipes have been found. Whole fish is used with 
       added blood and guts. It is not definitively known if liquamen 
       denotes a difference in formula or simply a change in name over 
       time, but some think liquamen denotes the everyday sauce and Garum 
       the costly extra-premium product. <u>Subst:</u> use an everyday 
       Thai fish sauce like Tiparos.</li>
     <li><b>Muria:</b> &nbsp; An ordinary quality sauce made from tuna 
       guts, or a third quality sauce made from any fish or shellfish 
       that had no other use at the time. In the Roman provence of Judaea 
       certified kosher versions were made excluding all shellfish or 
       fish without scales. <u>Subst:</u> Philippine Patis fish sauce.
       </li>
     <li id="allec"><b>Allec:</b> &nbsp; This was a paste 
       formed in the bottom of the barrels, a byproduct of making fish 
       sauce. Allec was not used for cooking but served as a condiment. 
       <u>Subst:</u> try the Philippine sauces 
       <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html#dilis">Bagoong Monamon</a> or 
       <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html#dilis">Bagoong Terong</a> - if you dare - or Vietnamese 
       <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html#mamnem">Mam Nem</a> for something a bit less pungent. 
       We really don't know which is closer.</li>
     <li><b>Oxygarum:</b> &nbsp; Garum mixed with vinegar, similar to 
       Southeast Asian dipping sauces.</li>
     <li><b>Meligarum:</b> &nbsp; Garum mixed with honey.</li>
     </ul>

<h2 id="colat">Colatura di Alici</h2>
<p>
<img src="img/sf_pdcolatur01c.jpg" alt="Colatura" class=mrg>
This fish sauce is made in Italy today, but it's not known if by an 
ancient process or one just a few hundred years old. It does differ 
substantially from the original Roman product where the end objective 
was fish sauce.</p>
<p>The name means "filtration of anchovies" and it's a byproduct of 
salting anchovies in barrels. Made this way the quantity is small and it 
is highly concentrated and quite expensive. A price of about $7.50 an 
ounce makes it quite attractive to chefs at fancy restaurants, but that 
isn't to say it isn't worth it. Just a couple of drops per serving will 
do in any case.</p>
<p>Thai fish sauce is of similar strength as drawn from the barrels, but  
is diluted to about 20% when bottled. &nbsp; <small>Photos

<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="seasia">Southeast Asian Clear Fish Sauce</h2>

<p>
<img src="img/sf_pdnampla02k.jpg" alt="Fish Sauces" class=mrg>
<img src="img/sf_pdfshsau01k.jpg" alt="Fish Sauces" class=mrg>

These sauces are heavily used in Thailand and Vietnam taking the place 
soy sauce holds in China and Japan. It is both a flavoring element and 
provides the salt for the dish it is included in. The great majority of 
Thai and Vietnamese recipes include at least some fish sauce.</p> 

<p>This type of fish sauce is also important in the Philippines, but is 
less used in other countries of Southeast Asia. Fermented shrimp paste, 
fish paste and other similar condiments are more prevalent in those 
countries.</p>

<p><u>Subst:</u> There is no truly satisfactory substitute for fish sauce. 
A fermented yellow bean sauce is about as close as you can get, and that 
would be suitable for strict vegetarians, but it is not clear. Lacking 
that, you would have to use plain salt but an important flavor element 
will be missing.</p>

<p>Thai fish sauce is now common in Southern California because of the 
many Asian communities here, but it's also being adopted into the famous 
"California cuisine" -  expect it to spread. Here are the national 
names for it, as best I could find them, anyway.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>California - nampla (easier to say than nuocmam)</li>
  <li>Thailand - nam pla</li>
  <li>Vietnam - nuoc mam</li>
  <li>Philippines - patis</li>
  <li>Cambodia - tuk prahoc</li>
  <li>Malaysia - budu</li>
  <li>Burma (Myanmar) - ngan byar yay</li>
  <li>Japan - shottsuru</li>
  <li>China - yu lu</li>
  </ul>

<p>Fish sauce is made by layering salt and freshly caught anchovies in 
large barrels or crocks and setting the barrels out in the hot sun for 
a year or up to two years. The fish are digested by their own digestive 
enzymes. The clear fish sauce is then drained through a tap at the bottom 
of the barrel, filtered and diluted with water to the desired strength, 
usually about 20%, and bottled. Some bottles carry designations like 
30&deg;N, 40&deg;N, 50&deg;N. This is a measure of the nitrogen content, 
which correlates with the amount of protein in the fish sauce. Lower 
numbers indicate a lighter sauce.</p>

<p>The "first extraction" provides the top grade sauce. The barrels may 
then be refilled with salt water for a second extraction but that 
"cooking grade" product isn't commonly exported to the US. The process 
of making fish sauce is time consuming and expensive, so some 
manufacturers add hydrolized wheat protein, acids, MSG and other 
additives to speed digestion and mask defects. Check the label.</p>

<p><u>Buying:</u> Look for a perfectly clear light amber color and an 
ingredient list including only Anchovies, water, salt and sugar. Most 
shipped to North America has some sugar, which may not be included in 
the same brand as sold in its home market. Price as a guide is rather 
unreliable here in Southern California, so it's probably even less 
reliable elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are probably at least 30 brands sold in Los Angles. Most come 
from Thailand and the Philippines but Vietnamese is becoming more common. 
Some Thai sauces are "Vietnamese style" and have Vietnamese lettering 
along with Thai. This is said to indicate they are slightly lighter 
and less salty than normal Thai practice.</p>

<p> Philippine fish sauces are considered heavier and undesirable for 
Thai and Vietnamese cooking. They are generally made from a number of 
different fish rather than just anchovies, harking back to the Roman 
practice of using a single fish species for the top grades and just 
about any fish for the lower grades.</p>

<p>Here are a few notable brands.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Red Boat 40&deg;N:</h3> &nbsp; This is a newcomer (2015), 
    heavily marketed as a super-premium Vietnamese fish sauce. It is 
    sold by Trader Joe's and other high end markets at a super-premium 
    price - 2016 US $4.49 for 8.45 ounces ($0.53 / ounce) at Trader 
    Joe's, and the same price at the large Asian market where I buy most 
    of my fish sauces, but higher at Sur le Table and Whole Foods. 
    Vietnamese fish sauces are supposed to be lighter and less salty 
    than Thai brands, but Red Boat is noticeably darker, stronger and 
    saltier than any Thai fish sauce I have on hand, and tastes to me a 
    little harsh. Comparing to Golden Shell and Newtown (see below), I 
    seriously question if this sauce is actually suitable for Vietnamese 
    cuisine. I also question how a tiny "family secret" can go into huge 
    volume production almost overnight. Nonetheless, it is seriously 
    challenging Three Crabs as darling of the foodie set.</li>
  <li><h3>Megachef:</h3> &nbsp; Another newcomer (2015), a super-premium 
    30&deg;N Thai fish sauce developed by the people who make Squid 
    brand. It sells in Los Angeles for a reasonable price, 2016 US $2.95 
    for 23.6 ounces ($0.13 / ounce). In my opinion it is smoother and 
    less harsh than Red Boat, and light enough for Vietnamese cuisine 
    as well as Thai. I have recently been using this sauce in dips and 
    other places where the fish sauce itself is emphasized.</li>
  <li><h3>Tra Chang:</h3> (Scale) &nbsp; A top premium brand from Thailand, 
    considered one of the very best by experienced Thai cooks. Not the 
    easiest to find here in Los Angeles. I will comment more when I 
    find some.</li>
  <li><h3>Golden Boy:</h3> &nbsp; Another Thai premium brand that's highly 
    recommended by experienced cooks, but a little hard to find here 
    in Los Angeles.</li>
  <li><h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp;  This is a well regarded premium brand from 
    Thailand that is very available. I have used this product for years, 
    as it's widely accepted by Thai cooks, available, and attractively 
    priced: 2016 US $0.06 / ounce at the Asian markets (or an incredible 
    $0.44 / ounce plus shipping from Amazon). The only real downside is 
    that the thoroughly American label lacks exotic mystique. It's a 
    shaker bottle, very inconvenient for me, so I run the point of a 
    small knife around the plastic restriction to remove it.</li>
  <li><h3>Tiparos:</h3> &nbsp; A widely available fish sauce by one of 
    Thailand's leading food companies. It's put up in cheap seeming 
    plastic bottles, but is considered a very good fish sauce. It's 
    a big seller in Thailand and its "trade dress" is widely imitated 
    by knock-offs. Tiparos is very modestly priced at 2016 US $06 per 
    ounce.</li>
  <li><h3>Golden Shell:</h3> &nbsp; This premium Vietnamese fish sauce is 
    "100% pure first press extra virgin", made from Anchovies and Salt, 
    no other ingredients. It is a lot lighter and less salty than 
    Red Boat, but Vietnamese fish sauces are supposed to be lighter and 
    less salty than Thai. It costs 2016 US $0.12 per ounce at an Asian 
    market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), vs $0.53 for Red Boat.</li>
  <li><h3>Newtown:</h3> &nbsp; This premium Vietnamese fish sauce is 
    "100% fresh first native extraction", made from Anchovies and Salt, 
    no other ingredients. It is a lot lighter and less salty than 
    Red Boat, but Vietnamese fish sauces are supposed to be lighter and 
    less salty than Thai. It costs 2016 US $0.09 per ounce at an Asian 
    market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), vs $0.53 for Red Boat.</li>
  <li><h3>Thai Kitchen:</h3> &nbsp; This fish sauce is put up in small 
    bottles at a high price, and is not considered in the top ranks - 
    but it may be the only fish sauce available in some regions. Thai 
    Kitchen is an American brand that's been well marketed and is 
    carried by many grocery chains. The 7 ounce bottle in the photo 
    above cost more than the liter of Squid, a better fish sauce.</li>
  <li><h3>Three Crabs</h3> &nbsp; This one has had a cult following in 
    North America for having been recommended by some TV chef or other. 
    Part of its appeal is doubtless the exotic Asian label, but its 
    flavor is quite decent. Among actual Asian cooks, it is more 
    favored by Vietnamese than Thai, and it is recommended by Korean 
    cooking maven Mangchi. On the other hand, it says "Product of 
    Thailand" and "Processed in Hong Kong", and it contains fructose 
    and "hydrolized wheat protein" (a "concealment name" for 
    <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sa_msgh.html">Monosodium Glutamate</a> (MSG)). All this 
    indicates the possibility it is manufactured by chemical hydrolysis 
    rather than natural digestion. In any case, it's kind of hard to 
    fully trust anything "processed" in the land of lead and melamine. 
    The manufacturer has several other brands (Flying Fish, Flying Lion, 
    etc.) with similar fine print on the label. The price is above 
    average at 2016 US $0.14 per ounce in the Asian markets. </li>
  <li><h3>Rufina Patis</h3> &nbsp; A typical Philippine fish sauce made 
    from various scads, herring, sardines, mackerels, water, salt and 
    Sodium Benzoate added as a preservative.</li>
  <li><h3>Vegetarian Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; These come from Vietnam, which 
    has a stricter form of Buddhism than Thailand. They are not easy to 
    find in Southern California, which is just as well, because the ones 
    I've sampled were truly awful. If you don't need a clear sauce, use 
    Yellow Bean Sauce (Healthy Boy is good), and if you need clear, just 
    use salt, or perhaps soy sauce.</li>
  </ul>

<p>I would like to point to a comparison of 13 fish sauces on a Web 
site named "Our Daily Brine". There were only two tasters, neither 
with any Asian credentials, nearly all their comparisons were straight 
from the bottle, and their results are very much at odds with expert 
Thai and Vietnamese cooks. They placed Red Boat at the top, and brands 
preferred by highly experienced Asian cooks (Golden Boy, Squid and 
Three Crabs) at the bottom. I suggest this review be disregarded.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other Fish Sauces</h2>
<p></p>


<h3 id="worch">England &nbsp; - &nbsp; Worcestershire Sauce</h3>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdworces01m.jpg" alt="Bottle" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a blend of ingredients apparently intended to bring Asian flavors 
to England in a convenient to sell and use bottled form. It appeared about 
1830 but several cute stories of its creation are in conflict with each 
other and with history. All are probably false.</p>
<p>Since the first real ingredient after vinegar and sweeteners is 
"anchovies", actually salt digested anchovies, I'm including it here in 
the fish sauce category. The current Lee &amp; Perrins ingredient list 
is: vinegar, molasses, sugar, anchovies, water, hydrolyzed soy and corn 
protein ("concealment names" for MSG), onions, tamarinds, salt, garlic, 
cloves, chili peppers, natural flavorings, shallots.</p>
<p>Fish sauce, tamarind, chilis and shallots are often used in various 
combinations with each other in Southeast Asia, though never put up in a 
single sauce.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="dilis">Philippines</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Bagoong Monamon Dilis 
  <small>&amp;</small>  Bagoong Terong
<br><img src="img/sf_pddilis02k.jpg" alt="Monamon Dilis" class=mrg>
<p>
This sauce is very popular in the Philippines, particularly the northern 
Iloco region. It is pretty much what's left in the bottom of the barrels 
after the patis fish sauce is drained off. It might be similar to the 
Roman <a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html#allec">allec</a> but we're not sure. It may be ground 
smooth or it may have whole anchovies in it as the photo specimen does. 
Monamon Dilis is made from anchovies but Bagoong Terong is made from a 
fish called "bonnet mouth fish".</p>
<p>This sauce is very strong, extremely salty and the smell is way 
stronger and fishier than regular fish sauce. Now we're definitely 
getting into that "acquired taste" space.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="mamnem">Vietnam</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Mam Nem / Mam Nem Phu 
  Quoc
<br><img src="img/sf_phuquoc01h.jpg" alt="Bowl of Mam Nem Phu Quoc " class=mrg>
<p>
This Anchovy sauce is very similar to that used in Cambodia and Burma, 
differing from Laos in that freshwater fish is used there. It is thick, 
almost a paste, and very pungent. The most famous producer of this sauce 
is the island of Phu Quoc off the far southwest corner of Vietnam (and 
contested by Cambodia). It is usually sold in tall narrow 7 ounce bottles 
(front center bottle in photo at top). It is particularly used in a 
dipping sauce (also called <a href="https://clovegarden.com//recipes/sjf_mamnem1.html">Mam 
Nem</a>), made with pineapple and other ingredients. Ingred: fish, water, 
salt.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3> 
Cambodia</h3> - <i>Prahok</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp;  <h3>Vietnam</h3> - 
<i>Mam C&aacute;</i> (fish name) &nbsp; | &nbsp; <h3>Laos</h3> - 
<i>Pa Daek</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <h3>Thailand, Issan</h3> - 
<i>Nam Pla Raa</i>
<br><img src="../recipes/img/sjf_tukprah02c.jpg" alt="Jar of Mam C&aacute;" class=mrg>
<p>
This very pungent sauce is made by fermenting various saltwater and 
freshwater fish for a few months to 3 years. Asian markets here in 
Los Angeles carry many varieties made from different fish, whole or 
in chunks. Ingredients are generally Fish, Salt, Sugar, Powdered 
Grilled Rice, Sodium Benzoate (or another preservative). This is a 
very important fish sauce in Cambodia, where the Cambodian clear fish 
sauce, Tuk Prahok, is made from Prahok. For more information, more 
photos, and the method for making Tuk Prahok, see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//recipes/sjf_tukprah1.html"><b>Tuk Prahok Sauce</b></a> 
recipe page.</p>

<p>Fermented fish, fish chunks and pastes are also made in Laos 
(<i>Pa Daek</i>) and Issan, Thailand (<i>Nam Pla Raa</i>), always 
with fresh water fish as Laos and Issan have no access to the sea. 
The Lao use Rice Bran instead of Powdered Grilled Rice found in the 
commercial versions from Vietnam, but its basically the same. 
Vietnamese versions made with Gourami or Mud Fish (Snakehead) should 
be good for Laotian and Issan cuisine. <br class=cll></p>
