<h1>Fish Products</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Fish have been on the human menu for as long as there have been 
humans (about 315 million years) and probably for our pre-human 
ancestors as well. Fish, however, are extremely perishable. Efforts 
to preserve them for longer periods have resulted in some very 
interesting products which have long outlived the necessity for 
preservation.

<h2 id="fish">Fish Sauce</h2>
<br><a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html">

  [Nam Pla (Thai); Nuoc Mam (Viet), Patis (Philippine); Garum, 
  Liquamen, Muria, Allec (Roman); Garos (Greek)]
<p>
<b>Fish sauce</b> is essential to several cuisines, particularly those 
of Vietnam and Thailand today and of the Roman Empire. Fish sauce is 
made by packing small fish or fish blood and innards or a combination 
of both into large barrels or jars layered with salt and setting the 
barrels out in the hot sun for around a year. The fish is digested by 
its own digestive enzymes and a clear salty liquid is eventually drained 
off and bottled. The paste left in the bottom of the barrels is also 
bottled and sold as a different kind of fish sauce. For types and 
culinary details see our 
<a href="sf_pdfishsauce.html"><b>Fish Sauce</b></a> page.</p>
<p><u>Subst:</u> there is no true substitute for fish sauce. If you 
are a strict vegetarian a fermented yellow bean sauce is about as close 
as you can get. Lacking both you must resort to just salt.

<h2>Fish - Dried, Salted <small>&amp;</small> Smoked</h2>
<br><a href="sf_pdfshdry.html">
<img src="img/sf_fshsalt03k.jpg" alt="Dried Whole Fish" class=mrg></a>
<p>For thousands of years, fish have been dried, salted and smoked as a 
means of preserving a very perishable product. These products remain 
important to all countries worldwide that have a seacoast, and some 
that don't. Even in regions where freezing and fast transportation make 
such preservation unnecessary, they are still in high demand because of 
the unique flavors they impart to many recipes. For types and culinary 
details see our 
<a href="sf_pdfshdry.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted &amp; 
Smoked</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Smoke Dried Fish</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_fshdsmkz.html">
<img src="img/sf_fshsmka01c.jpg" alt="Smoke Dried Fish in Market" class=mrg></a>
In West Africa and other regions without widely available refrigeration, 
fish is smoked until very dry. This product is very different from our 
Western smoked fish, which still need refrigeration. Fish that have gone 
through this smoking are tough, brittle, and need extensive soaking 
before use in recipes.	For details and examples see our 
<a href="sf_fshdsmkz.html"><b>Smoke Dried Fish</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Fish - Canned, Pickled, etc.</h2>

<p>
Some fish are particularly suitable for processing in a wide variety of 
ways.</p>

<h2>Fish Eggs <small>&amp;</small> Caviar</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_eggsz.html">
<img src="img/sf_cavlump02h.jpg" alt="Lumpfish Caviar, red and black" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Fish eggs (roe) have been on the human menu for thousands of years, 
prepared and eaten in various ways. According to the United Nations, 
other international groups, and the U.S. Customs Service, the term 
"Caviar" can only be used for the roe of Sturgeons and Paddlefish. 
Despite this, in common usage, the eggs of other fish eggs that 
have been salted and aged as sturgeon caviar is, are often also 
called "caviar", clarified with the name of the fish the eggs came 
from. For types and culinary 
details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_eggsz.html"><b>Fish Eggs &amp; 
Caviar</b></a> page.

<h2>Fish Pastes</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_fbackp02h.jpg" alt="Block of Featherback Paste" class=mrg>
Fish pastes are important for making fish cakes, fish balls, and 
similar items. Some fish are easy to make into pastes at home, and 
some are not. Most important in the "not" category is the 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_fbackz.html"><b>Featherback</b></a>. This fish is nearly 
impossible to eat and difficult to make into paste - but the texture 
of its flesh is unique, making the very finest fish cakes. For this 
reason, Featherback paste is made on an industrial scale and can be 
found in the frozen food cases of markets serving a Southeast Asian 
community, in blocks or tubs. The block in the photo was purchased 
from a large Asian market in San Gabriel, 14 ounces for 2018 US $4.69 
(5.36 / pound). Other "difficult" fish, such as Dace are also 
processed this way.

<h2>Shark Fin - Artificial</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_shrkfa.html">
<img src="img/sf_shrkfa02h.jpg" alt="Shark Fin, Artificial" class=mrg></a>
Because real Shark Fin is illegal in civilized regions, due to the horrid 
inhumane practices of the East Asian shark fin industry, artificial shark 
fin has been made available, and is much easier to use then the real thing. 
Unfortunately, while there's little actual difference, it is not 
suitable for the famous Shark Fin Soup offered at Chinese banquets - it's 
not nearly costly enough. "Incredibly high cost, 1000 times enjoyment", 
old Chinese saying (also valid for Japan). For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_shrkfa.html"><b>Shark Fin - Real and Artificial</b></a>
