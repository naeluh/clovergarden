<h1>Fish - Dried, Salted <small>&amp;</small> Smoked</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>For thousands of years, fish have been dried, salted and smoked as a 
means of preserving a very perishable product. These products remain 
very important to all countries worldwide that have a seacoast, and some 
that don't. Even in regions where freezing and fast transportation make 
such preservation unnecessary, they are still in high demand because of 
the unique flavors they impart to many recipes.<p>

<h2>Cold Smoked Fish / Hot Smoked Fish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_fshsmkz.html">
<img src="img/sf_maccsmk06e.jpg" alt="Cold Smoked Mackerel" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Cold Smoked Fish is a raw fish product that (except for Salmon) needs 
to be cooked before consumption. Hot Smoked fish is ready to eat or use 
as a snack or in recipes such as salads. Both are made by preparing with 
a salt cure, then smoking at a controlled temperature. For details and 
examples see our <a href="sf_fshsmkz.html"><b>Smoked Fish</b></a> 
page.

<h2>Smoke Dried Fish</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_fshdsmkz.html">
<img src="img/sf_fshsmka01m.jpg" alt="Smoke Dried Fish in Market" class=mrg></a>
<p>In West Africa and other regions without widely available refrigeration, 
fish is smoked until very dry and crumbly. It needs a long soak before use. 
This product is very different from our Western smoked fish and has it's own 
<a href="sf_fshdsmkz.html"><b>Smoke Dried Fish</b></a> page.

<h2>Salt Cod</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/sf_codsaltz.html">
<img src="img/sf_codsalt02e.jpg" alt="Salted Cod Fillet" class=mrg></a>
[Bacalao (Basque, Spanish); Baccala (Italian); Bacalhau (Portuguese)]
<p>
Salt Cod was once an important staple in Europe, particularly Spain, 
Portugal, and Italy. The fishery, off the coast of Newfoundland, 
was discovered by Basque whalers, and they invented the salting 
technique still used today (the Norwegian Vikings freeze dried their 
cod).</p>
<p>While fish can be transported and stored frozen today, the 
unique flavor of salt cod is still much favored in the cuisines of 
Spain, Portugal and Italy, as well as Canada and Brazil. The photo 
specimen was 19-1/2 inches long, 7 inches wide and 1-1/2 inches 
thick at it's thickest point, and weighed 2.3 pounds. It was 
purchased from an Italian market in Los Angeles, for 2013 US $ 11.99 
per pound. &nbsp;

<h2>Vobla</h2>   
<br><a href="sf_voblaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_vobla02e.jpg" alt="Dried Caspian Roach Vobla" class=mrg></a>
This fish is most often Caspian Roach, but other fish of the Carp family 
are also used. Vobla are a very popular snack item in Russia, Ukraine 
and Armenia, so are very common in ethnic markets here in Southern 
California. These fish are very dry, heavily salted, flat, thin, 
completely covered with large, hard, unremovable scales, full of bones 
and stiff as a board - so how can you eat this thing? Well, we have 
instructions on our <a href="sf_voblaz.html"><b>Vobla</b></a> page.

<h2>Asian Moist Salted Fish</h2>   
<br><a href="sf_fshsaltz.html">
<img src="img/sf_fshsalt03h.jpg" alt="Asian Salted Fish" class=mrg></a>
This form of salted fish is used through Southeast and East Asia. It is 
salted without drying, so is moist and must be kept refrigerated or 
frozen. The traditional form shown in the photo is now rare. Today it is 
most commonly found in the frozen fish case, neatly packaged in flat 
plastic bags with heads, fins and bones removed. Mackerel is the most 
common and easily recognized from its blue color and broad stripes. 
<p>The photo specimens were purchased from a bulk bin at a local Korean 
market. They were 11 inches long and weighed a shade over 1/2 pound each.

<h2>Asian Dry Salted Fish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_fshdsaltz.html">
<img src="img/sf_croakyd02h.jpg" alt="Asian Dry Salted Yellow Croaker" class=mrg></a>
This form of salted fish is particularly popular in China, and can be 
very expensive, depending on type of fish and especially size. It is 
fully dried so it need not be refrigerated or frozen.

<h2 id=bflake>Bonito Flake / Shaved Bonito</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdbonflake01k.jpg" alt="Shaved Bonita Flakes" class=mrg>
[Katsuobushi (Japan)]<p>
Bonito Flakes are extremely important in Japanese cuisine and are also 
used in Korea. They are used both to make soup stock and sprinkled on dishes 
as a condiment. Bonito fillets are smoked, fermented 
and dried to the hardness of a board, then shaved extremely thin. This is 
quite similar to the process of making 
<a href="sf_pdfshdry.html#mald">Maldive Fish</a> except for the final shaving. Similar flakes 
(sababushi) are made from mackerel.
<br class=cll><p>

<h2>Mackerel Flakes / Shaved Mackerel</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
[Sababushi (Japan)]
<br>This is similar to <a href="sf_pdfshdry.html#bflake">Bonito Flakes</a> but made from 
mackerel instead. Since bonito are members of the Mackerel/Tuna family the 
difference is not great.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id=mald>Maldive Fish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdmaldiv01h.jpg" alt="Maldive Fish" class=mrg>
[Hiki-kandu mas]<p>
Producing this dried fish product, made from fresh bonito, is the major 
industry of the Maldive Islands southwest of Sri Lanka (Ceylon). It is as 
essential to the cuisine of Sri Lanka as fish sauce is in Thailand. Bonito 
fillets are boiled, smoked and sun dried until hard as a board. They will 
then keep indefinitely stored in a dry place.</p>
<p>Traditionally this fish was sold by the piece. For use it was pounded 
in a large mortar until broken into tiny slivers. Today it is more often 
sold chipped or pre-pounded in plastic bags. The photo shows chips as 
I purchased them on the left and after pounding in my large stone mortar 
on the right.</p>
<p><u>Subst:</u> Japanese bonito flakes are made by a similar process but 
shaved rather than splintered. They are much less dense so use a larger 
measure -or- Philippine Tinapang Durog, a very similar pounded product 
made out of round scad can be substituted in the measure the recipe calls 
for.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Tinapang Durog</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdtinapang02k.jpg" alt="Philippine Pounded Fish" class=mrg>
This dried, smoked, fermented and pounded fish product is similar to 
<a href="sf_pdfshdry.html#mald">Maldive Fish</a> but made in the Philippines from round 
scad instead of Bonito. The samples I purchased were not completely dried 
and were sold from a refrigerated case in small plastic bags. While it 
could be dried more completely for room temperature storage it's not a 
big deal to keep it in the freezer compartment.
<p><u>Subst:</u> Japanese bonito flakes are made by a similar process but

<h2>Dried Anchovies</h2>
<br><a href="sf_anchodz.html">
<img src="img/sf_anchod01e.jpg" alt="Dried Anchovies, small and large" class=mrg></a>
This form of dried fish is used very widely in East and Southeast 
Asia. They come in many sizes, the photo showing some of the smallest 
(0.68 inch long) and largest (2.5 inches long) common sizes. These 
were purchased at a Korean market in Los Angeles. The small ones are 
often crushed to paste with some water to make an impromptu fish sauce 
for use in soups, stir fries and the like. The larger are used to make 
Korean Anchovy Stock, a very important basic ingredient.

<h2>Kapenta</h2>
<br><a href="sf_kapentaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_kapenta05e.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Sardines" class=mrg></a>
[Kapenta, Matembia (Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe)  <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika Sardine) <i>Stolothrissa tanganicae</i> (Lake Tanganyika 
Sprat)]<p>
These two closely related fish are native to Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi. 
The Sardine can grow to 6 inches (15 cm), but is usually around 3-1/2 inches 
(9 cm). The Sprat is smaller, growing to 4 inches (10 cm), but commonly 2-3/4 
inches (7 cm). They are both freshwater sardines, and are of considerable 
nutritional value to people in the region. For details see our 
<a href="sf_kapentaz.html"><b>Kapenta</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Dagaa / Silver cyprinid</h2>
<br><a href="sf_dagaaz.html">
<img src="img/sf_dagaa01e.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Silver Cyprinids" class=mrg></a>
[Lake Victoria Sardine, Omena (Kenya); Dagaa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania); 
Mukene (Uganda); <i>Rastrineobola argentea</i>]
<p>This fish is native to the Lake Victoria drainage, including the Victoria 
Nile, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Nabugabo. It is the only fish native to Lake 
Victoria that survives in great numbers after introduction of Nile Perch and 
Nile Tilapia. This fish can grow to just over 3 inches (8 cm) long. It looks very 
much like the Kapenta, but is a Carp while they are Herrings. It is a major 
commercial fishery and important to human nutrition, in the region. IUCN 
Red List LC (Least Concern). For details see our <a href="sf_dagaaz.html">

<h2>Stockfish</h2>

<img src="img/sf_stockfsh01h.jpg" alt="Stockfish Bits" class=mrg></a>
[Stoccafisso (Italy);  Baccal&agrave; (Venice); Bakalar (Croatia); 
Okporoko (Nigeria)]
<p>
Stockfish is fish dried without salt, by cold air and wind while hanging 
on racks. Some fermentation from cold tolerant bacteria also takes place. 
This can only be done in regions with the right climate. The most common 
fish used is Cod, but Haddock, Pollock and Cusk are also used. Stockfish 
is much used in Iceland, Portugal, Italy and Nigeria. Without salt to 
hold water, stockfish is very hard and dry. It takes at least 24 hours 
of soaking (water changed periodically) to soften it for recipes. &nbsp;

[Philippine Salt Dried Fish]
<p>
Tiny salted and dried fish are a very popular ingredient in 
Philippine cooking. Many different fish are treated this way. They 
are used both as an ingredient and as a flavoring, particularly with 
rice, mung beans or other dishes that need a little flavor boost. The 
photo specimens, Yellowtail Scad, were purchased from a Philippine 
market in Los Angeles. The fish were about 5 inches long and weighed 
0.33 ounce each. &nbsp;

<h2 id="kusaya">Kusaya</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_kusaya01s.jpg" alt="Jar of Kusaya" class=mrg>
Developed on the Izu islands, this Japanese fermented and dried fish is 
famous for it's amazing stench, but it takes a distant second place to 
the <a href="sf_herrpicz.html#sustrom"><b>Surstr&ouml;mming</b></a> 
of Sweden. The stench, in both cases, is caused by fermenting with too 
little salt to properly preserve the fish - probably due the the very 
high cost of salt in ancient times. 
<p>Scad, Flying Fish and similar small fish are washed many times in 
clear water, then stay 8 to 20 hours in a stinky brine that may have been 
maintained for generations. The fish is then dried in the sun for about 
2 days and put up in jars. The flavor is mild, and kusaya is often eaten 
while drinking sake or shochu.  &nbsp; <small>
