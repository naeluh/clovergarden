<h1>Shellfish Products</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Shellfish have been on the human menu for as long as there have been 
humans (about 315 million years) and probably for our pre-human 
ancestors as well. Shellfish, however, are extremely perishable. Efforts 
to preserve them for longer periods have resulted in some very 
interesting products which have long outlived the necessity for 
preservation.

<h2>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html">

<p>
<b>Shrimp paste</b>> is very important to sauces and dishes 
throughout Southeast Asia and Southern China. Basically it's shrimp, 
usually very tiny shrimp, salted, fermented, and dried until it breaks 
down into a paste which may be bottled or pressed into cakes. 
Much has been made of the overpowering smell and strong salty taste, 
but I haven't noticed these to be a problem, at least in high quality 
bottled products. Now the pressed block products are another matter 
entirely, you're going to want to seal them up tight in a jar. For details 
see our <a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce Page</b></a>.

<h2>Shrimp - Dried</h2>
<br><a href="sf_shmpdryz.html">
<img src="img/sf_shmpdy14k.jpg" alt="Various Dried Shrimp" class=mrg></a>
[Hibi (Philippine); Ebi (Indonesia); Ebi (Japan (fresh or dried)); 
Kung Haeng (Thai); Tom Kho (Viet)]
<p>
Dried and Smoked shrimp have been important since mankind first learned 
to go to sea in boats, and make nets from local fibers. They are 
important as a powerful flavoring element in almost every country that 
has a seacoast, and to some that do not. For types and culinary details 
see our <a href="sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Shrimp - Dried</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Crayfish - Dried <small>&amp;</small> Smoked </h2>
<br><a href="sf_crayafz.html">
<img src="img/sf_craya03k.jpg" alt="Whole and Ground Smoked Crayfish" class=mrg></a>
<p>[<i>Nematopalaemon hastatus</i> (Estuarine Prawn) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Exhippolysmata hastatoides</i> (Companion Shrimp) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Macrobrachium vollenhoveni</i> (African River Prawn)]
</p><p>
<u>Confusion</u>! &nbsp; West African "Crayfish" are 
freshwater Shrimp (or Prawns, depending on your preferred terminology) 
and are not closely related to North American Crayfish, which are 
fresh water lobsters. The catch is predominantly of the three species 
listed above. West African Crayfish are usually smoked, which is why 
you will find recipes listing both "Dried Crayfish" and "Dried Shrimp".  
For details see our 
<a href="sf_crayafz.html"><b>Crayfish - Dried &amp; Smoked</b></a> 
page.

<h2>Crab Paste / Sauce</h2>
<br><a href="sf_pdcrabsc.html">
<img src="img/sf_pdcrabp01k.jpg" alt="Crab Pastes" class=mrg></a>
[Gach Cua Xao Dau An (Thai) &nbsp; | &nbsp; (Rice Paddy Crab sauces) 
Ba Khia, Nuoc Cot Cua Dong, Gia Vi Cua Nau Bun Rieu (Viet); Nam Bpo 
(Thai); Taba ng Talangka, Aligue (Philippine)]
<p>
<b>Crab Pastes</b> are not as widely used in Southeast Asia 
as Shrimp Pastes, but rice paddy crab sauces and pastes are very 
important in Laos and Issan, Thailand, where there is no access to the 
sea, and are also used in Vietnam. A entirely different crab paste is 
very popular in the Philippines, made not from crab meat or ground up 
crabs, but from the eggs of tiny crabs. For details, including how to 
make some of these sauces and pastes, see our 
<a href="sf_pdcrabsc.html"><b>Crab Paste / Sauce</b></a> page.  
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="scald">Scallops - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvscaldry01h.jpg" alt="Small Dried Scallops" class=mrg>
[Conpoy (Cantonese)]
<p>
This is a popular and well though of flavoring for soups and similar 
dishes. It is the dried adductor muscles that close the scallop's shell. 
Small ones run about 2021 US $61 per pound, while larger ones, about 3/4 inch 
diameter, will be over 2021 US $100 / pound. They are sold by size in grams, 
1G, 2G, 3G, 4G. 2G is a popular size, but the photo specimens are 1G, 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra). The flavor is 
quite powerful, so just a few small ones will usually do the job. They can 
be crushed and added to recipes without soaking, but are often soaked and 
then shredded. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Scallops - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvscaldry03h.jpg" alt="Scallop Mantle Meat" class=mrg>
This product is not the scallop's adductor muscle, but the mantle that 
surrounds the body. It is a substantial piece of the scallop and has a 
flavor similar to the adductor, but the texture is different. Chopped up 
in soup, it doesn't really matter. The photo specimens were purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) in a 6 ounce 
package for 2019 US $26.64 / pound, about half what the smaller adductor 
muscles fetch.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Clams - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvclmdry01h.jpg" alt="Dried Clams" class=mrg>
Faced with a West African recipe that asked for Dried Clams, I found 
my usual Asian market didn't have them. So, I bought a 14 ounce bag 
of frozen Asian littleneck clams for 2018 US $3.76 / pound. I salted 
them for a couple hours, drained them and put them in my electric 
dehydrator set to medium. In a few hours I had dried clams. The 14 
ounce bag of frozen clams yielded 2-1/4 ounces of dried clams, or 
2018 US $23.34 per pound.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Mussels - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvmsldry01h.jpg" alt="Dried Mussels" class=mrg>
[Qing kou g&agrave;n (China)]
<p>
Yet another dried shellfish used in Asia to add flavor to soups and 
sauces. These have a stronger, darker flavor than the dried clams. The 
photo specimens were purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) in a 3 ounce package for $25.01 / pound.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Oysters - Dried</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_bvoysdry01h.jpg" alt="Dried Oysters" class=mrg>
[H&aacute;o sh&igrave; (China)] <p>
Dried Oysters are used to flavor soups and sauces, and are also featured 
at Chinese New Years, combined with 
<a href="al_fatchz.html">Fat Choy / Black Moss</a>, both due to their 
names suggesting words for good fortune. Fat Choy, a dry land 
cyanobacteria, has no redeeming culinary or nutritional value, may be 
toxic, and its harvest is ecologically damaging. The oysters are, 
however, edible, with a strong dried shellfish flavor. Chinese consider 
the best to be big ones from Korea and Japan. I have ordered Chinese 
ones on-line for 2018 US $27.57 / pound with free shipping.

<h2>Cuttlefish Ink / Squid Ink</h2>
<br><a href="sf_pdcrabsc.html">
<img src="img/sf_cuttlink01c.jpg" alt="Jar of Cuttlefish Ink" class=mrg></a>
<p>Available in small jars and tiny 4-gram packages (and probably some 
in between) this product is important as a black food coloring in Spain 
and Italy. It is easily available from on-line sellers of Spanish food 
products. In Italy it is often used to dye pasta black. While Cuttlefish 
Ink is most common, Squid Ink is also sometimes used.
