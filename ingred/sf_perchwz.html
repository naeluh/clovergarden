[<i>Morone americana</i>]
<p>
Not actually a Perch but a Bass, this fish is native to the North 
Atlantic coast, living in salt, brackish and fresh water, and is an 
invasive species in the Great Lakes. It is a good eating fish and can be 
cooked in various ways. The White Perch is not considered threatened, in 
fact it is considered a nuisance in some areas. It can grow to a little 
over 19 inches and 4-3/4 pounds, but the photo specimen was 10 inches 
long and weighed 11 ounces, toward the high end of typical market size.</p>

<p>This fish can be filleted and pan fried, pan fried whole or pan dressed, 
steamed, baked, grilled, or poached whole. When steamed there is so little 
skin shrink slashes are almost unneeded. The flesh is off white with a thin 
darker layer just under the skin. It has a pleasant flavor by any means of 
cooking, but, like other bass, it is not suitable for soups and/or stews.
</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish can often be found in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, for as little as 2010 US $1.29 / pound. Of course 
that's a "no cut, no clean" price, so it's all up to the purchaser.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales on this fish are medium size and scrape 
off quite easily with little flying around.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There are no particular problems gutting this 
fish, and the gills pull out fairly easily, but you may want to use 
kitchen shears to cut them loose at the bottom end.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet. When you get to 
the rib cage just cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and 
pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers - they pull fairly easily.
</p>

<p><b>Skin: </b> &nbsp; The skin has modest shrink, but enough to curl a 
fillet in a frying pan. If you press the fillet back flat with your turner 
the skin quickly looses its grip and the fillet will continue to fry flat. 
Fillets can be skinned quite easily with the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but it does not have a 
strong or unpleasant flavor, so can be left on for most forms of cooking.
</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 10-7/8 ounce fish yielded 4-1/4 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (39%) and 3-3/4 ounces skin off (34%). This is not a bad yield for 
so small a fish.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a pleasant usable 
fish stock with almost no oil, but what oil there is should be removed, 
using you gravy separator. For details 
see our recipe <a href="../recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
Stock</b></a>.</p>
