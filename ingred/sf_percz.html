<h1>Perch Families</h1>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_wall04d.jpg" alt="Whole Walleye Perch" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Perca</i> species; also <i>Latidae</i> (Lates perches)]
<p>
"Perch" is the prototype for Order <i>Perciformes</i> (Perch-like fishes) 
to which most of our familiar fish belong. Perch are properly fresh water 
fish of which Walleye, Zander, and Yellow Perch are the most well known. 
</p>
<p>There are a number of other fish called "Perch" that are not actually 
perch, but there are also a number of other families that are officially 
called "Perch" (with qualifiers), and those are included here The Perch 
Families are fairly closely related to the Bass Families.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Fresh Water Perch</h2>

<p>Family <b><i>Percidae</i></b> &nbsp; These are "Perch proper". They 
are fresh water fish and do not venture into salt water - well, the 
Zander does that a little, but not much.</p>

   <h2>Walleye</h2>
   <br><a href="sf_wallz.html">
   <img src="img/sf_wall04e.jpg" alt="Walleye, whole" class=mrg></a>
   [Yellow Pike, American Zander, <i>Sander vitreus</i> &nbsp;  | &nbsp; 
   similar Sandre Canadien, Sand pickerel; <i>Sander canadensis</i>]
   <p>
   Pronounced "Wally", this largest member of the true perch family in 
   North America and can grow to 42 inches and 25 pounds, but the photo 
   specimen was 18-1/2 inches and 2-3/4 pounds. This freshwater fish is 
   found in the great lakes and in most major rivers in the Northeast of 
   the U.S. and Canada. It is found in the Mississippi river basin as far 
   south as Arkansas. Commercial aquaculture is in the development stages 
   but large numbers are hatched for restocking lakes and rivers. 
   Red List status "Not Evaluated".

   [Pike Perch, Jack Salmon; <i>Sander lucioperca</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   very similar - Volga Pikeperch; <i>Sander volgensis</i>]
   <p>
   This elongated perch is native to Eastern an Central Europe, Sweden, 
   Finland and Western Asia, but has been introduced into England and other 
   countries as a popular angling fish. It can grow to 39 inches and 44 
   pounds, but is commonly around 20 inches and is considered a very good 
   eating fish. Red List status is "Least Concern". Restaurants in Minnesota 
   have been busted for serving imported Zander as <a href="sf_percz.html#wall">Walleye</a> 
   (from which it is indistinguishable on the plate), so see Walleye for 
   <a href="sf_wallz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

   <h2>Yellow Perch</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_perchy01e.jpg" alt="Two Live Perch swimming" class=mrg>
   [<i>Perca flavescens</i>]
   <p>
   This North American native lives mainly in northern lakes and rivers, 
   but a few are found as far south as South Carolina. It can grow to 
   nearly 20 inches and 4-1/4 pounds, but is commonly quite a bit 
   smaller. Red List status "Not Evaluated".

   <h2>Egli / European Perch</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sf_percheu02h.jpg" alt="European Perch" class=mrg>
   [<i>Perca flaviatilis</i>]
   <p>
   Very similar to the North American Yellow Perch, but not yet proven to 
   be the same species. This perch infests the ponds, rivers and streams 
   of Europe and most of Siberia, except Spain and Italy which are too 
   warm for it. In Europe they grow to about 10 pounds, but they have been 
   introduced to New Zealand and Australia where the record is 23 pounds. 
   They are commonly marketed at around 10 inches. Considered an excellent 
   eating fish, caught wild and farmed. IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).

<h2 class=lrg>Temperate Perch</h2>

<p>Family <b><i>Percichthyidae</i></b> &nbsp; Australia is the 
center for this Perch Family, but some are found in East Asia and 
the southern reaches of South America. Most are strictly fresh water, 
but some venture into brackish waters.</p>

   [Chinese Perch, <i>Siniperca chuatsi</i>]
   <p>
   A fresh water fish native to China and the Amur River basin, Mandarin 
   Fish is an aggressive predator feeding entirely on the young of other 
   fish species.  This fish is called for in many Chinese fish recipes 
   but is very rare here in Southern California - and rather expensive 
   when it is available. Now farmed as well as caught wild, this fish 
   can grow to nearly 28 inches and 17 pounds, but the photo specimen 
   was 11-1/4 inches long and weighed 15-5/8 ounces. Red list status: 
   Not Evaluated.

<h2 class=lrg>Latis Perch</h2>

<p>Family <b><i>Latidae</i></b> &nbsp; These fish include fresh water 
species, saltwater species, and some that live in both salt and fresh 
water. They are Indo-West Pacific fish.</p>

   Pla kapong (Thai); Siakap (Malay); <i>Lates calcarifer</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   very similar, Japanese Barramundi; Akame (Japan); <i>Lates japonicus</i>]
   <p>
   This Indo-Pacific fish is very important in Southeast Asia and northern 
   Australia, and also much appreciated in West Bengal and Bangladesh. 
   Both wild and farmed, it is a sought after fish that fetches 
   a premium price. It can grow to 78 inches and 132 pounds, but the 
   photo specimen was 17 inches long, weighed 2 pounds 14 ounces. It 
   probably came from from a fish farm in Thailand, but a growing number 
   are farmed in North America. They are also farmed in Indonesia, 
   Malaysia and Australia, with smaller operations in the UK and Holland.

   Chenku (Tanzania); Capitaine (French Africa); Am'kal (Egypt, Sudan); 
   Giwan Ruwa (Hausa (water elephant)); <i>Lates niloticus</i>]
   <p>
   This very large perch is native to the large rivers of East Africa, 
   Central Africa and Ghana in West Africa. It has been introduced to 
   Lake Victoria with considerable disruption of the lake ecology. It 
   can grow to 6 feet 6 inches and weigh 440 pounds. Nile Perch is a very 
   important food fish in the parts of Africa where it is found, and is 
   also exported to Europe. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern) - considered 
   a serious invasive in some regions.
