[Brill; <i>Eopsetta jordani</i>]
<p>
   This righteye flounder is native to the North Pacific coastal region 
   from Southern California at the Mexican border and north around the 
   Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It can can grow to 27 inches long and 8 
   pounds but the photo specimen was 18-1/2 inches and 3 pound 5 ounces, 
   a little larger than typical market size. This fish is mainly an 
   incidental catch off the Pacific coast from northern Baja to the 
   Bering Sea coast of Alaska, but there is a designated fishery in 
   Oregon.  It is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>LC</b> 
   (Least Concern), but in 2009 it was declared overfished off the 
   US coast.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Petrale Sole (actually a flounder) is considered 
one of the best eating fish on the California coast so fetches a fairly 
high price. It's flesh is white, mild and very tender and flaky. It makes 
a good substitute for European sole, but keep the cooking simple and the 
sauces unaggressive or you might as well save your money and use Tilapia. 
It is definitely not a soup or stew fish - it would just fall apart.

<p>Petrale is often pan fried, slowly in butter, or broiled or baked. 
It can be steamed or lightly poached, but the pieces should be kept 
moderate and poaching time very short (4 minutes) or it will break up 
in handling.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These fish are often to be found in the 
large Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles. I suggest buying whole 
fish, as fillets could be anything - mislabeling is rampant for the 
more expensive fish, even in sushi bars.  The photo specimen was 
purchased from a large Chinese / Vietnamese market in Los Angeles for 
2019 US $3.99 / pound. It was sold as "Gray Sole" (a much smaller fish), 
but I don't think that was a mistake.  It was just the only Petrale 
they had, so they tossed in with the other flounders.

<h3>Cleaning <small>&amp;</small> Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; You will find 
complete instructions on our  
<a href="seafishcf.html"><b>Cleaning &amp; Filleting Flat Fish</b></a> 
page. That page features the very same fish pictured on this page.
<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin of this fish has very little shrink, and 
doesn't have a strong flavor, so it can be left on for most methods of 
cooking.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen yielded 50.2% skin-on fillets, 
which would be about 40% skin-off. This fish had an unusually large 
amount of innards, so some will yield a couple percent more. A factory 
cleaned fish would yield up to 66% skin-on.
