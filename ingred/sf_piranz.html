<h1>Piranha Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_pacu04g.jpg" alt="Whole Paku Fish" class=mrg>
[family <i>Characidae</i>]
<p>
This family of fish are native to the rivers of South America and 
Africa. The South American ones have a very bad reputation for biting 
(and stripping cows to bare bones in a few minutes - not actually true), 
but several fish in the Pacu part of the family are farmed for sale in 
the markets, and they are really rather good eating. Pacus do bite, and 
one has a reputation for biting off the balls of skinny dippers, but 
they don't run in shoals like the famous Red-Bellied Piranha, which may 
also end up on the dinner plate. The African ones don't bite.</p> 
<p>Piranha/Paku are related to Carp and Milkfish at the suborder level, 
and are also very fine eating - for anyone accustomed to eating fish 
who's flesh is infested with thread like spines - a skill very much worth 
developing, as some of the most delicious fish are this way.

<h2>Pacu / Caranha</h2>

  (fb Cachama)]
<p>This is the Pacu with the reputation for biting the balls off skinny 
dippers, mistaking them for some of the floating nuts it normally 
feeds on. this fish can get to 21 inches and 44 pounds, and, whether 
the stories are true or not, it has teeth to do that. The photo 
specimen was found in the frozen fish cases of a large Asian market 
here in Los Angeles, labeled "Butterfish", though it is entirely 
unrelated to the Butterfish family or to any other fish so called.

<p>
This fish is not as toothy as it's relative, the Caranha (see 
above) which has the reputation as a ball biter, but enough that 
Fishbase lists it as "Traumatigenic", able to inflict serious bites - 
but it is not to be confused with the Red Bellied Piranha, which has 
an underbite jaw and sharper teeth. This fish is found in Brazil and 
Argentina, and farmed in South America and Asia. This fish can 
grow to 35 inches and 55 pounds, but the photo specimen was 13 inches 
long and weighed 1 pound 6-1/4 ounces. It was purchased off the ice 
at a Philippine fish market in Los Angeles, in early 2014.

<h2>Red Piranha</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_piranrd01e.jpg" alt="Live Red Piranha Fish" class=mrg>
[(fb), Red Bellied Piranha; <i>Pygocentrus nattereri</i>]
<p>
These fish do run in shoals, but defensively, not for hunting. 
Generally they are minor predators and scavengers. They are not usually 
aggressive, but during times of food shortage they have been known to 
kill people, though usually they just bite off a few fingers and toes. 
They are much more often eaten by people rather than eating people.
Stories of them stripping cows to bare bones in minutes have not stood 
up to examination. This fish can grow to over 20 inches and 8-1/2 
pounds. They are not considered endangered and are not currently 
farmed. &nbsp; <small> photo by Gregory Moine distributed under

<h2>Lutefish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_citharus01e.jpg" alt="Drawing of Lutefish" class=mrg>
[Genera <i>Citharinops</i>, <i>Cithardium</i>, <i>Citharinus</i>]
<p>
Lutefish can be found in all the major rivers of West, Central and 
East Africa. They are filter feeders, and unlike the Piranhas, do 
not bite. They are common enough to be significant food fish, but 
not much detailed information is available. They all look pretty 
much like the drawing, but the lower fins are often red. 
These fish can grow to about 33 inches and 40 pounds. They are not 
considered endangered and are not currently farmed.
