<h1>Pollock - Alaskan / Norway</h1>

[Walleye Pollock; <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> formerly <i>Theragra 
  chalcogrammus</i>]
<p>
Native to the North Pacific through the Sea of Japan, around Alaska and 
down to Carmel, California, Alaska Pollock are the largest fish harvest 
in the world at 3 million tons per year. Most is made into sirimi 
(artificial crab meat) and McDonald's fish sticks. This fish can grow 
to 35 inches and 8-1/2 pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-1/4 inches 
and 1 pound 4 ounces. Alaska Pollock is considered a sustainable catch 
by marine ecologists, IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated). Norway Pollock 
is a very rare fish and considered near threatened. It is genetically 
the same as the Alaska Pollock but has a few minor differences in 
appearance.</p>
<p>Actually, the major threat to Alaska Pollock is the mass harvesting 
of krill for the highly profitable manufacture of Omega-3 fatty acid 
supplements currently in fad status. This fish (and many whales) subsist 
mostly on krill, a tiny shrimp-like animal. Actual benefits of Omega-3 
supplements are still rather uncertain (except according to those selling 
the pills), and excessive use has been linked to aggressive prostate 
cancer in male humans, so it's best to leave plenty for the fish and 
whales.</p>

<p>This is a perfect fish for those who don't like fish - you can't taste 
it. Aside from being very bland, it is limp, eats low on the food chain, 
has little internal integrity, a weak stomach, and disintegrates entirely 
when exposed to heat. I'd propose it's name be changed to "Congress Fish" 
except for one discrepancy - it has a backbone.</p>

<p>Pan frying is not a good idea. Fillets dusted with rice flour and 
fried in very shallow oil, as I usually do, can be disastrous. When 
turned skin side down, the skin instantly becomes glue and sticks to the 
pan, even through a heavy dusting. Then, when you try to move it, it 
disintegrates. Perhaps frying can work if the fillet is heavily battered 
and deeper oil is used. I normally recommend against that method because 
you end up tasting only batter and oil, not fish. With this fish, though, 
that's all the flavor you'll get anyway.</p>

<p>Briefly poached, half fillets holds together well enough to carefully 
remove to a plate, but it's not easy to eat because it disintegrates when 
you touch it. All in all, I think McDonalds has the right idea - grind it 
up, mix it with plenty of binders and extenders, and use it for machine 
made "fish sticks".</p>

<p><b>Salted Pollock:</b> &nbsp; Goya, a distributer of mostly Hispanic 
foods, is currently (2018) selling salted pollock fillets from China in 
one pound packages, presumably as a low cost substitute for salted Cod. 
The photo specimen was 12-3/4 inches long and weighed 5-3/8 ounces. 
Soaked for 12 hours to remove salt it weighed 6-3/8 ounces. Flavor was 
similar to salted Cod but noticeably lighter, and the texture was much 
finer and softer. It could take only 5 minutes simmering before it 
started to flake apart. It was purchased from a multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles (Sunland) for 2017 US $5.49 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Fresh fish are often available in markets serving 
a Korean community. I suspect they use it to make fish balls or something 
like that. Dried pollock is very common in just about all Asian 
markets, but particularly Korean. Frozen pollock fillets are widely 
available, even in regular supermarkets. It's very inexpensive and worth 
at least half that. Frozen Pollock fillets from China are packed with 
a "moisturizer" (sodium tripolyphosphate), so those fillets will shrink 
<u>a lot</u> in cooking by any method.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is incompletely covered with scales 
that are tiny and thin. They scrape off easily as a gray slush with no 
flying about.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is full of mushy stuff, and the 
belly is so weak it often breaks, spilling gooey guts all over the place. 
The body cavity extends well behind the vent. Gills pull out fairly 
easily, but the collar will probably pull apart when you do that - that's 
not a problem since you're either going to discard the whole head or 
break it apart anyway.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is not real easy to fillet because it's 
bone / fin structure is discontinuous and not easy to follow, it's very 
limp which makes it clumsy to handle, and the flesh is soft and prone 
to fall apart. I've had the best success with this method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut off the head.</li>
<li>Make a cut on each side of the ventral (bottom fins) and pull the fins 
  out.</li>
<li>Make similar cuts on each side of the dorsal (top) fins and pull them 
  out. This exposes the real bone structure so you can find it and follow it.
  </li>
<li>Set the fish on it's belly and cut down to the backbone on both sides. 
  Then work across the backbone at the tail and work forward.</li>
<li>When you get to the rib cage, cut the ribs from the backbone with 
  kitchen shears and pull them from the fillets with long nose pliers. 
  They are short and very thin, but easy to locate in the soft flesh. 
  There are also some centerline pin bones for the length of the body 
  cavity which should be pulled out straight forward.</li>
<li>The front lower part of the skirt is coated with a jelly like substance. 
  I make a diagonal cut leaving only the part with normal flesh attached to 
  the fillet.</li>
</ol>
 
<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 4 ounce fish yielded 9-1/4 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (46%) and 8-5/8 ounces skin-off (43%).</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has very moderate shrink, but quickly 
turns to sticky goo when heated. It does have a somewhat stronger taste 
than the flesh, you can actually taste it. Raw skin is quite tough, and 
the flesh very tender, so it's easy to skin with no flesh lost using 
the standard long knife and cutting board

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins, simmered slowly for 30 
to 40 minutes, make a serviceable stock with inoffensive flavor 
and almost no oil. Remove what there is using your gravy separator. For
