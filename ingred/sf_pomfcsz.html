[Silver Pomfret; Pompano (Philippine); Butterfish; <i>Pampus argenteus</i> 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; similar: Chinese Silver Pomfret <i>Pampus chinensis</i>]
<p>
This tropical Indo-West Pacific fish is found near coasts from the 
Persian Gulf to Borneo, and as far north as mid Japan, but not as far 
south as Australia. It is not actually a pomfret but a butterfish. It 
can grow to 23 inches but the photo specimen, wild caught in India, was 
10 inches and weighed 9-1/2 ounces, a typical market size here in Los 
Angeles. This is a major commercial catch within its range. IUCN rated 
"Not Evaluated", White Pomfret is not considered threatened. It is, in 
fact, expected to have extended its range by 2050.</p>  
<p><i>Pampus chinensis</i> is very similar but the tail is generally not 
so deeply forked. It is smaller, has a smaller range and is a minor 
commercial catch.</p>

<p>"Pomfret" is one of the most sought after fish in India and Southeast 
Asia due to it's delicate white flesh with subtle "non-fishy" flavor. The 
flesh breaks up easily on the plate but not along distinct flake lines. 
It holds together well enough to poach fillets (skin off) but that isn't 
a usual way to prepare this fish. Fillets are too thin and tender for 
soup.</p>

<p>Steamed whole with a few diagonal slashes through the skin, this fish 
remains attractive and is quite manageable on the plate compared to 
many. The fin rays hold together fairly well and there are few ribs to 
deal with. It will also bake very nicely with the same diagonal 
slashes through the skin.</p>

<p>This fish is often deep fried whole, but must be handled carefully 
to avoid breaking up. A half pounder fits well in a wok with oil 
about 1-1/2 inch deep in the center or in a skillet with oil about 3/4 
inch deep. Heat oil to 375&deg;F and fry 5 minutes on one side, turn 
carefully and fry 3 minutes on the other side.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish can often be found in Asian fish 
markets serving Philippine, Chinese and Southeast Asian communities. 
This is a premium fish, but the price has declined with rising supply 
and is now around 2016 US $3.99 / pound as whole, uncleaned fish in 
Philippine fish markets in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish may be covered with minute bright 
silver scales, but they rub off so easily there may be only patches. 
Fish marketed here in Los Angeles generally have only a small patch 
protected by the pectoral fins, if that.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This would be easier with the head off, but 
this fish is often used head-on. Make an incision from the vent 
(almost directly below the root of the pectoral fins) forward to under 
the chin. There is a stiff keel, so you may need to cut just a tiny bit 
off center. This will give enough access to get a couple fingers in to 
scrape out the innards, which extend very high and a little aft of the 
vent. Scrape the gills loose at the bottom through the body cavity and 
pull them out through the gill slits with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; While this fish is most often used whole, it is 
not difficult to fillet, if that's what you want, and yield is good. 
Remove the head and outline the fillet by cutting through the skin top, 
bottom and over the tail. Cut from top front to back, then over the tail 
and work forward. When you get to the rib cage, just pull the fillet off 
the ribs. Examine it carefully for remaining ribs and fin rays. There may 
be one or two centerline pin bones.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 10 inch 9-1/2 ounce fish yielded 6 ounces 
skin-on (63%) and 5-1/4 ounces (55%). Yield is quite good due to the 
very small head.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Fillets are difficult to skin because the skin 
has very good adherence, and it is difficult to feel the divide between 
skin and flesh. Fortunately it would need to be removed only for poaching, 
which is not a usual use for this fish. The skin has a stronger taste than 
the flesh, but not annoyingly so. Skin shrink is definite, but fillets, 
lightly dusted with rice flour, can be pan fried skin-on. When the fillet 
is turned skin-side down, press it down with your turner. The skin will 
soon soften and the fillet will remain flat (though thicker than it 
started out). After cooking, particularly frying, the skin can easily be 
peeled off if desired, but there's really no reason to do so.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The heads, bones and fins, simmered slowly for 
40 minutes, make a very usable mild stock, almost clear and with 
just a hint of color. For details see our recipe
