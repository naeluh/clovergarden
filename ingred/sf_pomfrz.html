<h1>Pomfret</h1>

[Family <i>Bramidae</i>]
<p>Yes, there actually are real pomfret, but the fish called "Pomfret" 
in the market aren't. They're <a href="sf_butterz.html">Butterfish</a> and 
<a href="sf_pompanz.html">Pompano</a>. The "Black Pomfret" sold in fish 
markets is actually a Pompano, but there is a real Black Pomfret 
(<i>Taractes rubescens</i>). There's also Atlantic Pomfret 
(<i>Brama brama</i>) and Pacific Pomfret (<i>Brama japonica</i>).</p>

   <h3>Pomfret, Black (Gray)</h3> - see under Pompanos 
   <a href="sf_pompanz.html">Black Pomfret</a>. There is actually a 
   Black Pomfret that's a real Pomfret (<i>Taractes  rubescens</i>), 
   but the pompano is what you'll find called "black pomfret" in the 
   markets.<p></p>

<h2>Pacific Pomfret</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_pompacz.html">

[<i>Brama japonica</i>]
<p>
This is a real Pomfret, not something just called "Pomfret" - and a very 
strange fish it is. It infests most of the Pacific, from Vietnam to 
Peru, from Alaska to below Peru. It stays near the surface, but also 
stays well offshore. It can grow to 24 inches TL (total length) and 6 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-3/4 TL and weighed 1 pound 7-14 
ounces. This is a difficult fish to deal with, but we have methods on 
our <a href="sf_pompacz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a> page.

<h2>Sickle Pomfret</h2> 
<br>
<img src="img/sf_pomsyc01e.jpg" alt="Whole Sickle Pomfret" class=mrg>
[Monchong (Hawaii); <i>Taractichthys steindachneri</i>]
<p>
This is an Indo-Pacific fish found from Madagascar through Indonesia, 
on east to Hawaii and Southern California. It ranges from as far north 
as Japan and as far south as the North Island of New Zealand, but always 
stays within the edge of the continental shelf. In Hawaii, it is popular 
in restaurants under the name Monchong. It can grow to 24 inches TL 
(total length). Note the trailing edge of the tail fin is white or 
translucent on this fish. IUCN NE (Not Evaluated).

<h2>Atlantic Pomfret</h2> 
<br>
<img src="img/sf_bramab01e.jpg" alt="Whole Atlantic Pomfret" class=mrg>
[Angelfish (South Africa market); Ray's Bream; <i>Brama brama</i>]
<p>
This fish is found in the Atlantic from Iceland south to Patagonia, in 
the Indian Ocean, and in the South Pacific, worldwide, but especially 
around Australia and New Zealand. It can grow to 39 inches and 13 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 20 inches, a more common size. It resides 
near the surface and only occasionally approaches the shoreline. It is 
usually bycatch from other fisheries, especially in South Africa, where 
it is marketed as "Angelfish", which it is not. IUCN LC (Least Concern).
