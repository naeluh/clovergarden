<h1>Pompano Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_pompg12g.jpg" alt="Whole Florida Pompno" class=mrg>
[family <i>Carangidae</i> (Jacks &amp; Pompanos)]
<p>These are fairly deep bodied ocean fish of family <i>Carangidae</i> 
(Jacks and Pompanos). and are prized eating fish worldwide. The family 
is, however, a bit confusing because some pompanos are called 
<a href="sf_butterz.html">Butterfish</a> and <a href="sf_pomfrz.html">
Pomfret</a> while some fish from those families are called "Pompano".

<h2>Black Pomfret</h2>

<img src="img/sf_pomfbk15e.jpg" alt="Whole Black Pampano" class=mrg></a>
[<i>C. Parastromateus niger</i>]
<p>
Actually not a Pomfret but a Pompano (the two families look a lot alike), 
this is an Indo-West Pacific fish ranging from the north coast of Australia 
to southern Japan and from Africa to Borneo. It can grow to 29 
inches but the photo specimen was 10-1/2 inches and weighed just over 
15 ounces, toward the large size seen in the markets. Black pomfret vary 
in darkness - the photo specimen is darker than many. Though highly 
commercial this is a fast breeding fish and not considered threatened.

<h2>Florida / Golden Pompano</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_pompcz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pompg12e.jpg" alt="whole Florida Pompano" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Trachinotus carolinus</i> (Florida Pompano, Common Pompano); 
<i>Trachinotus blochii</i> (Golden Pompano, Asian Pompano)]
<p>
These Pompano are highly preferred eating fish. The specimen in the 
photo was marketed as "Golden Pompano" which is supposed to be 
<i>T. blochii</i> but it looks more like Florida Pompano 
<i>T. carolinus</i>. <i>T. blochii</i> has a much longer dorsal fin. Both 
can vary in shape because they tend to get more elongated as they become 
older and larger. Florida wild caught pompanos are very expensive 
(actually this fish is found from Massachusetts to Brazil). Both species 
are farmed commercially and I wouldn't be at all surprised at hybrids of 
the two. <i>T. carolinus</i> can grow to 25 inches and <i>T. blochii</i> 
to 43 inches, but the photo specimen was 12-1/4 inches and weighed 1 
pound 9 ounces, at the high end of market size here in Los Angeles.

<h2>Paloma Pompano</h2> 
<br><a href="sf_pomppz.html">
<img src="img/sf_pompp02e.jpg" alt="whole Paloma Pompano" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Trachinotus paitensis</i>]
<p>
The Paloma Pomapno is a highly desirable eating fish, but not well known 
due to its limited range, and that it is not currently farmed. It is 
found close to the coast from Southern California to Peru, and around 
the Galapagos Islands. It is a minor commercial catch through this range. 
All three of the specimens I purchased had a slight golden 
blush along the lower flank, typical of the species, but not visible 
in the photo.This fish can grow to 20 inches, but are commonly 12 
inches. The photo specimen was 14 inches and weighed 15-1/4 ounces.

<h2>Great Pompano</h2>

<img src="img/sf_pompgrt01e.jpg" alt="Live Great Pompano" class=mrg></a>
[Old Wife, Banner Pompano, Palometa, Cobbler, Gafftopsail (Caribbean); 
<i>Trachinotus goodei</i>]
<p>This fish is native to the West Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to 
Argentina, including Bermuda, the Caribbean Islands, and Gulf of Mexico. 
It can grow to 19-1/2 inches and 1-1/4 pounds, but is commonly 14 inches.
It is primarily a game fish. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).
