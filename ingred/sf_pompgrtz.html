<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; There are minor commercial fisheries in the 
Caribbean region, so it is probably available in local fish markets there. 
It is totally unavailable here in Southern California.<p></p>

<h3>Health:</h3> &nbsp; In reef areas, there have been reports of 
ciguatera poisoning.<p></p>
