[Silver Pompano (market, incorrect); <i>Trachinotus paitensis</i>]
<p>
The Paloma Pomapno is a highly desirable eating fish, but not well known 
due to its limited range, and that it is not currently farmed. It is 
found close to the coast from Southern California to Peru, and around 
the Galapagos Islands. It is a minor commercial catch through this range. 
All three of the specimens I purchased had a slight golden blush along 
the lower flanks, typical of the species, but not visible 
in the photo.This fish can grow to 20 inches, but are commonly 12 
inches. The photo specimen was 14 inches and weighed 15-1/4 ounces.</p>

<p>This pompano is a medium flavor fish with flesh that holds together 
well enough for most modes of cooking, but should go into soups and 
stews near the end. The flesh is near white except for a darker strip 
down the centerline right under the skin, but that dark flesh does not 
have a strong or oily flavor. The flesh breaks up easily on the plate, 
but is fine grained and doesn't flake in an orderly way. My favorite 
way to eat this fish is to dust fillets with lightly salted rice flour, 
pan fry gently, and eat with a dip of

Fish</b></a>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is a minor commercial catch and not 
farmed, so it is not commonly found in fish markets - it's a "buy it 
when you see it" fish. The photo specimen was 14 inches long and weighed 
15-1/2 ounces. It was purchased from a Philippine fish market in Los 
Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2019 US $2.99 / pound (on ice). The price is 
modest (Golden Pompano was $3.99) because this fish is unfamiliar to 
most of the customers. The fish was sold as "Silver Pompano", which 
is not correct.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Paloma Pompano has only an incomplete covering 
of tiny scales that scrape off as a slush without making a mess. They 
are mainly on the aft 1/3 of the fish.
<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp;  This is a somewhat Deep Bodied Fish, but it 
has no hard keel, so work with it by our instructions for 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and Filleting Round Bodied 
Fish</b></a>. The body cavity extends a little beyond the vent, but is 
not difficult to clean out. The gills pull rather hard, and tend to 
break up, so a strong pair of long nose pliers is a great help. There 
are also grinding stones in the throat for crushing shells, and the 
pliers help here too. There is a tough membrane at the top of the body 
cavity that has to be scraped out to get at the blood works just under 
the backbone.<p></p>

<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; This is about as easy a fish to fillet as 
you're going to find. The bone structure is complete and easy to follow 
with the knife and you can end up with a "see through" skeleton with 
almost no flesh on it. Cut from the top down to the backbone, then 
hop the backbone at the tail and work forward. When you get to the rib 
cage, just cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears. The ribs 
pull fairly easily and quite cleanly with long nose pliers, but do 
tend to break a bit. There is also a row of substantial centerline pin 
bones for the length of the body cavity - pull them straight forward. 
Go deep, because they are mostly near the skin, and they break up a 
lot, so feel for fragments.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin is fairly strong and feels a little 
leathery, but has no strong or off flavor. It has fairly severe shrink 
when fried or poached, but quickly looses its strength and adhesion. 
When frying skin-on, do the skinless side first, then turn and gently 
press the fillet flat. Poaching skin-on, the fillet will curl sharply, 
but will flatten out completely when placed on the plate.
<p>If you wish a skinless fillet, the standard long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a> works fine. Add the skins 
to the stock pot with the heads, bones and fins. The skin is easily 
peeled from a cooked fish if you desire to do that. I usually use this 
fish skin-on. For baking or steaming, make a few shallow diagonal cuts 
just through the skin.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 15-1/4 ounce fish yielded 9 oz of fillet skin-on 
(59%), 7.92 ounces skinless (52%) - a very good yield.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones, fins and skins make a very nice 
fairly light soup stock. There will be little oil, but remove what there  
is using your gravy separator. See
