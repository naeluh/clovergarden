Ponyfish) &nbsp; | &nbsp; similar - <i>Leiognathus equulus</i> (Common 
Ponyfish)]
<p>
These tropical Indo-Pacific fish is found from the east coast of Africa 
to the Pacific Islands, as far south as the north coast of Australia, 
and as far north as Japan. The fish get their name from their strange 
extensible mouths, which look like a pony's nose when extended.</p>
<p>The Striped Pony Fish (photo) can grow to 8 inches and the Common 
to 11 inches, but the photo specimen was 8 inches and weighed 5-3/4 oz, 
caught wild off Thailand. Living near river mouths and in mangrove areas 
they are both caught wild and farmed, and sold both fresh and dried. 
They have no scales I could find so are probably not kosher, but they're 
IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).</p>

Pony Fish flesh is medium in flavor and stays fairly firm when cooked.
This fish is very bony, but the bones are mostly fused together at the 
fin bases so it's not real hard to eat. A 9 oz Pony Fish will yield about 
4 oz of edible flesh (44%). The skin shrinks severely when cooked, so If 
you steam this fish whole, the body skin comes off in shreds, and since 
the whole head end is just skin over bone, it comes apart and looks 
really ugly. Not recommended.</p>

<p>My favorite way to eat these is to cut off the head behind the collar 
(which makes cleaning very easy), lightly dust them with rice flour and 
pan fry them - then pour a little lemon butter sauce over and eat them 
off the bones. That's most easily done with chopsticks, which is how I 
always eat fish. The fillets come clean off the skeleton and the only 
bones you have to deal with are a very few long thin ribs up at the 
front. Not too much trouble at all, and when they're on sale 
for 2006 U.S. $0.99/# at a Philippine fish market, why not?</p>
