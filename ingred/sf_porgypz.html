<p>
This is a very desirable eating fish. It is a West Pacific fish found 
from northern Vietnam up the coast to southern Japan and Korea, but is 
not found around the Philippines. It can grow to 39 inches, but is most 
commonly around 12 inches. The photo specimen was 13-3/8 inches long and 
weighed 1 pound 3-5/8 ounces. This fish is IUCN Red Listed as LC (Least 
Concern). It is caught wild, but is also extensively farmed. This is the 
second most heavily farmed fish in Japan.</p>

<p>Red Seabream is a very prestigious fish in Japan, served on many 
important occasions and sold at a high price. It is also very popular 
in Taiwan. The flesh is near white, with a moderately light and quite 
pleasant taste. It is pan fried, steamed, broiled and baked. for cooking 
as whole or pan dressed fish, the skin must be slashed with diagonal 
cuts about 1 inch apart, because skin shrink is severe.<p> 
<p>I usually prepare this fish as skinless fillets and pan fry with a 
light dusting of rice flour. To best enjoy the excellent flavor of this 
fish, it should not be heavily battered, and should be eaten with a 
lightly flavored sauce. I use a light white wine, lemon juice and butter 
sauce. Skinless fillets can be gently poached, but that's about all the 
wet cooking this fish can take.</p>
<p>If you want to make a really good fish soup or stew (for which the 
flesh of this fish is useless) you could buy a few, fry up the fillets 
for supper and use the heads, bones, fins and skins to make stock. See 
our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish Stock</b></a> 
page for how to keep the stock for weeks without clogging your freezer 
compartment.</p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Red Seabream (Pink Porgy) occasionally appears 
in the Asian fish markets here in Southern California. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock, 
actually) as "Pink Porgy" for 2016 US $2.99 / pound. It's said to be 
much more expensive in Japan.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is covered with large scales with 
medium adherence - not real hard to scrape off but they will fly around 
quite a bit. They are thin, and some will capsize or otherwise need to 
be pulled off with long nose pliers. They are also invisible, so it's 
hard to tell if you got them all.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is a little more difficult to clean 
than some because of tough membranes in the body cavity. The gills 
pull a bit hard and are hard to get at because the gill slits are small. 
You'll be glad you have a sturdy pair of long nose pliers.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Skin shrink is extreme and relentless. It doesn't 
let go until fully cooked. Fillets must be skinned for any method of 
cooking. The skin is tough, so it's fairly easy to remove using the 
standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skin does not have a 
strong flavor and should be added to the stock pot along with the 
heads, fins and bones to add body to the stock. If you steam, bake, 
broil or grill this fish, make shallow diagonal cuts through the skin 
about 1 inch apart so it doesn't tear itself up and look ugly.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This is a fairly easy fish to fillet with a 
coherent, easy to follow bone structure. There is a hard bone at the 
back of the body cavity that attaches hard to the front tip of the anal 
fin and can be in the way. Cut down to the backbone, then over the 
backbone at the tail and forward. When you get to the rib cage, use 
kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone, then pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers. There are very substantial centerline 
pin bones which must be pulled for a little more than the length of the 
body cavity, but they are easy to find in the soft flesh and pull 
easily.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Yield is good, but not spectacular because of 
the heavy head and bones, which is what you would expect from a fish 
that makes its living crushing mollusks and crustaceans. A 1-1/2 pound 
fish will yield abut 10.2 ounces of skin-on fillet (43%) or 8.9 ounces 
skin-off (37%). On the other hand, all that "scrap" makes an awesome 
fish stock.<p></p> 

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones, fins and skin make an excellent 
light colored stock with a medium light flavor. It is so good it needs no 
other flavoring except a little salt. Remove the small amount of oil using 
your gravy separator. For details see our
