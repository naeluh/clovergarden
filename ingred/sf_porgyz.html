<h1>Porgy / Seabream Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_sheepb02g.jpg" alt="Sheephead Seabream" class=mrg>
[family <i>Sparidae</i>]
<p>
Porgies and Seabreams are deep bodied fish that subsist mainly by crushing 
shellfish and crustaceans. On the east coasts of North and South America 
the "Common Seabream", is the Red Porgy (<i>Pagrus pagrus</i>). 
<i>Pagrus pagrus</i> is also found on the coasts of southern Europe and 
North Africa, but the "Common Seabream" in Europe is the Blackspot 
Seabream (<i>Pagellus bogaraveo</i>). Here in California the familiar 
Porgies and Seabreams are all from Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Our 
Pacific Porgy (<i>Calamus brachysomus</i>) is not common in the markets.

This is a very desirable eating fish. It is a West Pacific fish found 
from northern Vietnam up the coast to southern Japan and Korea, but is 
not found around the Philippines. It can grow to 39 inches, but is most 
commonly around 12 inches. The photo specimen was 13-3/8 inches long and 
weighed 1 pound 3-5/8 ounces. This fish is IUCN Red Listed as LC (Least 
Concern). It is caught wild, but is also extensively farmed. This is the 
second most heavily farmed fish in Japan.

Found along the West Atlantic from Nova Scotia around along the 
northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, this fish is not found around 
the Caribbean islands. It can grow to almost 36 inches and 21 pounds 
but the photo specimen was 12-1/2 inches and weighed 1-1/2 pounds. 
It's an ocean fish but it freely enters brackish water and 
sometimes even fresh water. It is considered an excellent eating 
fish and fished commercially, but is not threatened.

[Pink Snapper, New Zealand Snapper, Australian Snapper, Squirefish; 
<i>Pagrus auratus</i>]
<p>
This Porgy is often sold in North America as "New Zealand Snapper" or 
"Pink Snapper", though it isn't a snapper nor closely related to them. 
It is found off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. A distinctly 
separate population is found from northern Vietnam to southern Japan. 
Farming this fish is in the development stages (2015) so some market 
fish may be farmed. This fish can reach 51 inches and 44 pounds, but is 
more commonly around 16 inches. The photo specimen was 12 inches 
long and weighed 1 pound 1 ounce. This fish is IUNC listed as DD 
(Data Deficient), but is not considered threatened.  &nbsp; 
<b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; The name "Snapper" allows this fish to be sold at 
a premium price, but it's not a snapper. It has very good flavor, but 
has limitations that may make it not worth the price to you. For details

[Silver Bass (suggested market name); <i>Stenotomus chrysops</i>]
<p>
This fish is found on the Eastern Seaboard of North America, from 
Nova Scotia, Canada down to Florida USA, but is not common south of 
North Carolina. It can grow to nearly 18 inches and a little over 
4-1/2 pounds, but is commonly a around 10 inches and 1 pound. This 
has long been held as a "trash fish", but is now getting some attention 
in the seafood market due to declining availability of the more popular 
fish. The flavor is light, and liked by many people, but it is not 
suitable for wet cooking and is usually pan fried, broiled or baked, 
often whole. Skin shrink is severe, so it must be slashed or removed for 
cooking. Some is exported to Japan. It was considered overfished, but 
regulations are in place and populations are recovering. It is IUCN 
Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated).

<p>
This is a very important food fish in the Northeast Atlantic. It is 
found from the coast of Morocco into the western Mediterranean and 
north to Iceland and Norway, even into the Arctic Circle. It is 
particularly common around the British Isles and along the western 
coast of France. It can grow to nearly 28 inches and nearly 9 pounds, 
but is commonly about 12 inches long. This fish is sold fresh and 
frozen, to be pan fried, broiled or baked. It does not appear in the 
fish markets in Southern California, so I have no further information.
