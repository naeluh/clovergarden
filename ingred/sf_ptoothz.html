  [Chilean Seabass, Merluza Negra (spanish), Mero (japan) <i>Dissostichus 
  eleginoides</i>]
</p><p>
A large fish (up to 250 pounds) living at great depths in the 
southern oceans from Uruguay to the Antarctic Circle. It has very white 
flesh with a high fat content but rather little flavor. A single large fish 
can sell for $1000 in Japan. Though marketed as "Chilean Sea Bass" in the 
U.S. it is not a bass at all nor is it specific to Chile.</p>
<p><u>This fish is endangered</u> by pirate fishing and it's slow rate of 
maturing. While there is some properly licensed commercial fishing, 
the pirate take is thought to be five times as large. It is not possible 
to tell legal from pirated fish so consuming this fish should be avoided.

<p>Patagonian Tothfish flesh is white, very mild flavored (insipid) and 
tender. It is almost always sold as steaks because of the size of the 
fish.</p>
<p>The company that originally marketed it found no takers because of 
its excessively mild flavor - until there was shortage of some other 
fish. In Japan, once the price got high enough to improve the flavor, 
it became all the rage and now they'll pay any price.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; If you really must have this fish, buy it from 
a legitimate source, such as Trader Joes, that certifies it comes from a sustainable harvest 
region. It's still not certain due to fraud in the 
fish business, but at least a try..</p>
