<p>
Found in tropic seas from the east coast of Africa to the South Pacific 
islands, the Java Rabbitfish is a vegetarian living on algae. It can grow 
to 20 inches but the photo specimen was 14 inches and 1.9 pounds, near the 
high end for market fish. Predatory fish that feed on rabbitfish can 
concentrate ciguatera toxins but rabbit fish themselves have not been 
implicated as a risk. Rabbit Fish reproduces quickly and is not listed as 
endangered (IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated)). They have no conventional 
scales so are not kosher.

These two Rabbitfish are very closely related and can interbreed. 
They also vary tremendously in coloration so are hard to tell apart. 
The Virgate ranges from the east coast of Africa to the South 
Pacific islands while the Barred ranges from southern India across the 
Pacific to the coast of Central America and northern South America. They 
both go as far south as the northern coast of Australia and as far north 
as the northern tip of the Philippines. Both are vegetarian, living on 
seaweed (algae). The Virgate can grow to nearly 12 inches and the Barred 
to almost 10 inches. Rabbitfish reproduce quickly and are not listed 
as endangered (IUCN Red List NE (Not Evaluated)). They have no 
conventional scales so are not kosher.</p>

<p>Rabbitfish is an excellent eating fish with a good, moderate flavor 
throughout. The flesh stays very firm when cooked by any method and it's 
good for curries. It flakes apart very easily if poached, so care is 
needed.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Java Rabbitfish can almost always be found in fish 
markets serving a Philippine community, always as whole fish and at an 
economical price. Virgate Rabbitfish is very rarely seen here in Southern 
California.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish has no scales to scrape off and presents 
no particular problem for cleaning. The body cavity extends way farther back 
than the vent but the bottom cut will be long enough to get in there and 
remove the innards. Handle carefully because some of the spines may be 
mildly venomous.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong flavor but it's fairly thick 
and will shrink enough to curl fillets when fried so it should be removed 
using the usual long knife and cutting board method.</p> 

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Rabbitfish is very easy to fillet with an easy to 
follow bone structure. You will lose the least flesh if you cut the ribcage 
from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull the ribs from the fillet with 
long nose pliers. They come out easily and cleanly. The centerline spines 
are softer than on most fish but should be pulled for the length of the body 
cavity, particularly on larger fish.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 14 inch 1.9 pound fish yield 12 oz of skinless 
fillet (40%).</p> 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones make a slightly oily 
stock that is stronger flavored than you'd probably want for soup.</p>
