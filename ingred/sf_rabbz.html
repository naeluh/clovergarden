<h1>Rabbitfish / Spinefoot Family</h1>

[Samaral (Philippine); family <i>Siganidae</i>]
<p>
Rabbitfish are tropical reef dwelling fish that, unlike most fish, are 
vegetarian, living on seaweeds (algae). Incidental to their diet they 
eat bacteria and other organisms adhering to the seaweed, and some of 
these contain ciguatera toxins. Predatory fish that eat Rabbitfish can 
concentrate these toxins to a dangerous degree, but Rabbitfish themselves 
contain only low, non-dangerous levels.</p>

(Philippine); <i>Siganus javus</i>]<p>
Found in tropic seas from the east coast of Africa to the South 
Pacific islands, the Java Rabbitfish is a vegetarian living on algae. It 
can grow to 20 inches but the photo specimen was 14 inches and 1.9 pounds, 
near the high end for market fish. Rabbitfish reproduces quickly and is 
not listed as endangered (IUCN NE (Not Evaluated)). They have no 
conventional scales so are not kosher.

</p><p>
These two Rabbitfish are very closely related and can interbreed. 
They also vary tremendously in coloration so are hard to tell apart. 
The Virgate ranges from the east coast of Africa to the South 
Pacific islands while the Barred ranges from southern India across the 
Pacific to the coast of Central America and northern South America. They 
both go as far south as the northern coast of Australia and as far north 
as the northern tip of the Philippines. Both are vegetarian, living on 
seaweed (algae). The Virgate can grow to nearly 12 inches and the Barred 
to almost 10 inches. Rabbitfish reproduce quickly and are not listed 
as endangered (IUCN NE (Not Evaluated)). They have no 
conventional scales so are not kosher.
