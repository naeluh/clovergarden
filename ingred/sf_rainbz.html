[<i>Oncorhynchs mykiss</i>]
<p>
   Rainbow / Steelhead was reclassified from <i>Salmo</i> to 
   <i>Oncorhynchs</i> in 1989, so it is now officially a Pacific Trout and 
   considered identical with the Russian trout of the same name. Rainbows 
   are native to the west coast of North America from the Mexican border 
   north and around across the Aleutian Islands to Russia, and as far south 
   as northern Japan. Rainbow trout are now farmed worldwide because the 
   supply of native trout is totally insufficient to meet demand.</p>

   <p>Rainbows are generally between 12 and 18 inches long unless they go 
   to sea and become <a href="sf_steelz.html">Steelheads</a>. Their bright 
   rainbow colors fade quickly upon death so are not evident in the fish 
   markets. The farm raised rainbow in the photo was 18-1/2 inches long 
   and weighed 2 pounds 5-1/4 ounces factory cleaned, rather larger than 
   average market size. It's flesh was a bright salmon color indicating it 
   was fed a diet including the dye fed to farmed salmon.</p>

<p>Rainbow Trout are now heavily farmed worldwide and U.S. farm 
production is over 70 million pounds per year (2010). A single farm in 
Idaho produces over 20 million pounds of that. Aside from farming, they 
are stocked in rivers and lakes worldwide for recreational fishing, 
particularly in Europe.</p>

<p>Trout is particularly liked in Europe, but the rivers and lakes there 
cannot come close to filling the demand. Europeans now eat mostly farmed 
Rainbows, just as we do here. Some people consider the taste of farmed 
rainbows or rainbows from lakes inferior and insist on wild river fish. 
Of course there's no chance wild rivers can deliver that extra 70 million 
pounds. Without farmed trout every last fish caught would be shipped air 
express to Japan where paying astronomical prices is thought to greatly 
enhance flavor and enjoyment.</p>

This fillet is from the photo specimen fish above. Clearly it was on the 
"salmon diet" to have that color. The dye used is the same dye that colors 
salmon and steelhead in the wild and does not affect flavor. The white 
areas of fat deposits which add richness to the fillet. This was one 
delicious trout, fried simply with a light dusting of salted rice flour 
and eaten with my simple <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html">
<b>Lemon Wine Sauce for Fish</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Because it's an oily fish, trout is suitable 
for fast high temperature cooking such as frying, broiling or grilling, 
but is too fragile for rough treatment. Small Rainbows are often fried 
whole or pan dressed. They may also be boned and butterflied for frying. 
Larger fish are most often fried as skin-on fillets. What you want to do 
with trout is preserve the excellent flavor. Dust lightly with flour (I 
use salted rice flour) rather than using batters, and use simple 
seasonings and sauces that enhance flavor, rather than overpower it. 
Do not skin the fish because much of the flavor is right under the 
skin.</p>

<p>Rainbow trout is particularly good for stuffing because the body 
cavity is long and capacious, and the backbone and ribs are easy to 
remove. Stuffed fish are generally baked. One stuffing method, 
particularly popular in Europe, isn't available with factory cleaned 
fish. In that method the fish is cut from the top, the backbone is 
removed and the innards taken out through the top. The ribs are then 
pulled out and the fish is stuffed from the top and baked in it's natural 
upright position.</p>

<p>Trout may also be baked without stuffing, with slashes on the sides to 
absorb an herb dressing. Roll-ups are also made by wrapping fillets from 
small trout around a stuffing, and these too are baked. Trout is often 
smoked, which works exceptionally well because it's such an oily fish.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Here in Los Angeles the Asian fish markets don't 
always trout, but specialty markets serving a more European community 
certainly do. It is a premium fish and sells at somewhere around 2010 US 
$3.99/pound for large whole fish.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Rainbow trout are covered with very small thin 
scales - so small and thin that only larger fish need to have them scraped 
off. Probably any over 14 inches should be scraped. You may have to shave 
the scales off with the sharp edge of your prep knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; In North America all the farmed fish is shipped 
"factory cleaned", and I haven't seen a wild trout since childhood. 
Consequently, I can't tell you much except that with a body cavity that 
large there's got to be a lot of stuff in there.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; The only problem filleting this fish is that 
there are no bones to follow from the top until you get near the backbone. 
As you cut down from the top of the fish you will meet resistance just 
before the backbone. This is a row of numerous pin bones you must cut 
through or break away from the backbone. Once you get over the backbone 
the ribcage is unusually easy to follow with the knife and you can shave 
the fillet from the rib cage with almost no flesh left behind.</p>

<p>Once you have the fillet free, set it skin side down and deal with 
the pin bones. They are easy to locate by feel and pull very easily and 
cleanly. Pull them out straight forward with your long nose pliers. They 
become too soft to worry about as you approach the back end of the body 
cavity.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Fillets are exceptionally easy to skin using the 
long knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. 
The skin is thin, and enhances the flavor, so rainbows are most often 
cooked and eaten skin-on. Fillets can be fried skin-on because the skin 
has very little shrink, and then relaxes.  Fry the skinless side first 
to stiffen the fillet, then flip. You'll see some shrink, but just pat 
it down with your turner and it will relax.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Rainbow trout is a very high yield fish. The 2 
pound 5-1/4 ounce photo specimen yielded an amazing 1 pound 11-3/4 ounces 
of fillet (75%) and others have given similar yields. Of course that yield 
is from a factory cleaned fish, one caught live with all the guts in won't 
yield that high but it'll still be pretty good.</p>
 
<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Despite being an oily fish, trout heads, fins and 
bones make a serviceable soup stock, made by our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Remove all oil 
using a gravy separator.</p>
