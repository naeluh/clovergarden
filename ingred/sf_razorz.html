<h1>Razorfish</h1>

[<i>Iniistius baldwini</i> alt <i>Xyrichtys baldwini</i> of family Labridae 
(wrasses)]
<p>
This is a Pacific fish, ranging from the Pacific side of Sumatra through 
Hawaii to the Gulf of California and along the tropical west coasts of North, 
Central and South America. It is found most intensely around Borneo and the 
north central coast of Australia, but ranges as far north as the southern 
tip of Japan.</p>
<p>This is a small fish. The largest in the batch was about 7-1/2 inches 
long and weighed 2-7/8 ounces, about as big as they get. This fish is 
amazingly thin, the 7-1/2 inch fish being only 0.7 inches thick. Colors and 
patterns varied but most had the black and white spot displayed by the 
center specimen.</p>
<p>I presume the large fancy colored one with the top knot is a male. The 
male of most animal species is flashier to attract females - except for 
humans. The reason is, as any marriageable woman will tell you, there are 
plenty of males but not so many suitable as mates, so the competition 
is fierce. Unfortunately, most human females are irresistibly attracted 
to men that aren't the most suitable - probably obsolete hormones. 
Razorfish and other wrasses, incidentally, change sex during life, with 
the most successful individuals ending up as dominant males.</p>

<p>Razorfish have a white, mild but distinct tasting flesh that remains 
quite firm during cooking. Cooking and eating them does provide some 
challenges, though, as explained below.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Here we run into some unusual problems. Dusted 
with rice flour and fried, you will find the flesh so firm it's difficult 
to disassemble on the plate. Could we fillet it? Not advised. It's 
remarkably difficult to fillet - too much effort for so small a fish 
<u>and</u> the skin shrinks so strongly the fillets will curl up into a 
tube before you even get to turn them skin side down.</p>

<p>Well then, we could poach them - but a normal 8 minute poach leaves the 
flesh still way too firm. I suggest poaching or steaming for 20 to 25 
minutes  Then you will have a delectable little morsel that's not too 
challenging to eat.</p>

<p><b>Eating:</b> &nbsp; I find the best way to eat these fish is with 
pointy Japanese style chopsticks - the Chinese ones are too blunt and 
clumsy. As with other tiny long-finned fish, you need to be careful not 
to break up the fins as you remove the flesh. With a little practice you 
will end up with a bare skeleton with fins intact top and bottom. A light, 
simple sauce of lemon juice, white wine and butter is ideal for this kind 
of fish.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; There is no razorfish fishery, so you can't just 
go out and buy them. They're something you may come across accidentally, 
most likely in a market serving a Philippine community.</p>

<p><b>Scaling:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with scales 
that are very large for the size of the fish, but they're thin and scrape 
off easily with very little flying about.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Should you wish to cook these "head on", you 
would need to pull the gills with small long nose pliers, and they don't 
pull at all easily. Their attachment is much stronger than the gills, 
which just break up into small pieces.</p>
<p>I suggest cutting off the head. Make one cut on each side behind the 
pectoral and pelvic fins and use kitchen shears to cut through the 
backbone. Pull the head off, then split the belly and scrape out what 
little didn't come off with the head.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is very thin and would be very difficult 
to remove, but this is not necessary. Skin shrink during cooking is 
extreme, making fillets impractical even if you had the patience to 
fillet this fish (not easy).</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 7-1/2 inch fish weighed 2-7/8 ounces. Cleaned 
and head removed it was 2 ounces (70%). After eating, 0.38 ounces 
remained, so the edible yield was 1.62 ounces (56%) which is pretty 
good yield, especially for a fish that cost me 2010 US $1.99/pound.</p>
