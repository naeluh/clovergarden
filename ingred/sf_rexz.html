<h1>Rex Sole</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_rex08g.jpg" alt="Whole Rex Sole" class=mrg>
[<i>Glyptocephalus zachirus</i>]
<p>
This righteye flounder is caught in the North Pacific from Southern 
California to the Russian coast and down to Taiwan. The can grow to 23 
inches and a bit over 4 pounds, but the photo specimen was 15-5/8 
inches long and weighed 1 pound 1-1/4 ounces, typical in the markets 
here. Rex Sole and Gray Sole are often confused in markets, but the 
rex has a very long pectoral fin and the gray a very short one. The 
population is not considered threatened, Red List status <b>NE</b> 
(Not Evaluated).

<p> The flesh of Rex Sole is white, tender, fine grained and mild. 
This fish is an excellent substitute for the once common Sanddab, a 
lefteye flounder that lives in shallower water, but is now scarce in 
markets due to fishery regulations aimed at protecting rockfish.</p>

<p>Because it's inconvenient to fillet small fish, rex sole is usually 
sold either whole or "pan ready" (head, innards, tail and fins removed). 
Our <a href="sf_rexz.html#ready"><b>Pan Ready Method</b></a> covers making fish 
"pan ready" and cooking them in that form.</p>

<p>For some uses a pan ready fish is fine if properly handled, but for 
other recipes a pan ready fish just won't work - it'll fill the food with 
hundreds of tiny bones. for these uses you must fillet. Rex Sole isn't 
difficult to fillet but get the biggest fish you can to make it easier - 
<a href="sf_rexz.html#fillet"><b>Fillet Method</b></a>.

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 1-1/4 ounce fish yielded 8-1/2 oz of 
skin-on fillet (49%), 4-5/8 ounces from the eye side and 3-7/8 ounces 
from the blind side. This fish yielded 6-1/2 ounces skin-off. Don't 
attempt to skin fillets, you'll likely just break them up. The skin is 
very thin and normally left on. If you pan fry a fillet "skin-on" the 
skin will shrink a little but then relax as it cooks.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head bones and fins make a fairly substantial 
soup stock due to the gelatinous nature of the fin area. It is moderate 
flavored and usable There's a fair amount of oil which should be removed 
using your gravy separator.</p>

<h2 id="fillet">Fillet Method <small>for</small> Rex Sole</h2>

<p>Note that the photos in the left column are actually Gray Sole, but 
the Rex and Gray are totally interchangeable (and often wrongly labeled), 
so they are valid for both fish.</p>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish. Rex sole is covered with very tiny scales and the 
shape of the fish makes it difficult to scrape with the back of a knife 
as for other fish, but I find the toothy edge of a grapefruit spoon works 
just fine.</li>
<li>Clean the fish. Make a small cut on the blind (white) side and use your 
littlest finger to pull the innards out <b>- OR - </b> just remove the 
head with the innards as shown in the procedure for <a href="sf_rexz.html#ready">Pan 
Ready</a></li>
<li>Make a cut along the centerline deep enough to cut all the way to the 
backbone. The fillet is going to break in half anyway so we might as well 
make our work easy. Make the usual cuts under the front fins and collar 
to release the fillet from the head, and make a cut at a very shallow 
angle along the fin edges as shown.</li>
<li>Fillet from the centerline out following the bones. Should you 
accidentally get under the fin rays at the transition (quite likely 
on the thinner blind side) you can just deepen your fin edge outline cut 
until it meets the main cut.</li>
<li>You should end up with 4 long narrow fillets and bones with very little 
flesh adhering to them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ready">Pan Ready Method <small>for</small> Rex Sole</h2>

<p>Note that the photos in the left column are actually Gray Sole, but 
the Rex and Gray are totally interchangeable (and often wrongly labeled), 
so they are valid for both fish.</p>

<ol>
<li>Scale the fish as per <a href="sf_rexz.html#fillet">Fillet Method</a>.
<li>Make a cut under the collar and front fins as you would for fillet. 
Then take your kitchen shears and cut the backbone from the top just 
behind the head.</li>
<li>Pull the head away and it'll pull out all the innards with it.</li>
<li>Use your kitchen knife to cut off the fins, cutting just within the 
margin. No, you can't just cut in farther and remove the fin rays at this 
point, they overlap the main bones. Cut off the tail if you wish.</li>
<li>You are now ready to cook the fish by any appropriate method. Shown in 
the picture is steaming and pan frying but broiling would work well too.
</li>
<li><b>If steamed or poached:</b> the skin is likely broken up and 
unsightly. To remove it just press a paper towel over it, the skin will 
peel up with the towel. Do not attempt to remove the bottom skin, it's 
very thin, white, on the underside anyway and traditionally left on.</li>
<li>You could now serve the cooked fish and let the diners deal with the 
bones, but they'll appreciate not having to. With the fish on your cutting 
board, best side up, use your kitchen knife to scrape the fin rays away 
from the fish. Yes, you'll lose a little flesh but the flesh 
there is kind of gelatinous which some people don't like.anyway.</li>
<li>Serve in whatever way you please. The backbone and it's bones will 
still be in the fish but they will stay together and be very easy to deal 
with. There will be no loose bones at all.</li>
