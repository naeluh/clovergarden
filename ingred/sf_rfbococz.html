[<i>Sebastes paucispinis</i>]
<p>
This rockfish is found from along the Aleutian Islands of Alaska down to 
at least the Mexican border. It can grow to nearly 36 inches and 21 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 21 inches and 4 pounds, a little larger than 
average market size. This is a prized eating fish but it's IUCN Red Listed 
as CE (Critically Endangered) and the catch is restricted in California. 
Commercially Bococcio fillets are often mixed in with fillets of other 
rockfish.</p>

<p>Bococcio flesh is tender, nearly white and has excellent flavor, light 
but not insipidly so. There is a thin layer of darker flesh right under 
the skin, mainly at the tail end, which is not noticeably stronger in taste.
</p>
<p>The flesh holds together well for most types of cooking. It holds together 
well enough for light poaching, but will break up fairly quickly simmered in 
soup, but the flakes are very large so this may not be a problem. It is 
excellent poached or lightly powdered with rice flour and pan fried. It is 
not suitable for "whole fish" recipes because of skin shrink.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Bococcio is highly restricted but can sometimes 
be found in Asian markets in Los Angeles. It is a premium fish, but can 
sometimes be found on sale at as low as US $2.99 per pound. In other markets 
it may be sold as fillets mixed with other rockfish.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Bococcio is covered with medium size scales 
that scrape off fairly easily and fly about only moderately.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There's nothing unusual in cleaning this fish, 
but the throat is quite strong, so cut it off with kitchen shears. The 
gills are large and fairly firmly attached, so cut them out with kitchen 
shears also. Do be careful with the dorsal spines, they are exceedingly 
sharp and reputed to be venemous.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Bococcio is fairly easy to fillet with an easy 
to follow fin and bone structure, and the flesh holds together well. First 
cut off the head, turning the knife steeply under the gill covers to get the 
maximum amount of flesh. Outline the fillet by cutting through the skin along 
the top, across the tail and especially along the bottom. Cut from the top 
down following the bones to the backbone. Hop over the backbone at the tail 
and work forward. When you get to the ribcage just cut the ribs loose from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long nose 
pliers. They pull fairly easily and take almost no flesh. There are some 
very substantial centerline spines for the length of the body cavity but 
they are easy to locate. Pull them straight forward and they will come out 
fairly easily and cleanly. <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 4 pound fish yielded just over 2 pounds of 
skin-on fillets (50%) and 1 pound 14 ounces skin-off (47%). Fillet weights 
include the skirt which is fleshy and quite usable (if your fish was fresh).  
There will still be some flesh around the pelvic (bottom) fins which can't 
be removed until after a short simmer.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is fairly strong and doesn't release from 
the flesh easily.  Chunks of fillet can be pan fried skin-on by letting them 
cook almost all the way through before turning skin side down, then hold flat 
with the turner. The skin has no strong or "off" flavor. The skin is thin but quite 
strong, and it's adhesion is poor. You can almost peel it off so it's very 
easy to remove by the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Almost no flesh should be lost. 
I do recommend cutting off the skirt area and skinning it separately, 
otherwise the fillet is very wide.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones simmered slowly for 30 to 
40 minutes make a fairly light colored stock with moderate oil, but I 
didn't like the flavor. If you do use the stock, remove the oil using your 
gravy separator.</p>
