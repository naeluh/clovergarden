[<i>Sebastes macdonaldi</i>]
<p>
This rockfish is found from Santa Barbara, California, down to the tip 
of Baja California, Mexico, and in the Gulf of Mexico. It can grow to 
26 inches and 6 pounds, but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 1 
pound 14-3/4 ounces. This excellent eating fish and popular game 
fish is IUCN Red listed NE (Not Evaluated) and not considered 
endangered.</p>

<p>Mexican Rockfish flesh is tender, off white and has light but 
interesting flavor. There is a thin layer of darker flesh right under 
the skin, but it is not noticeably stronger in taste than the lighter 
flesh.</p>
<p>The flesh holds together well for most types of cooking. It holds 
together well enough for poaching, and flakes apart well on the plate. 
For soup it should be put in near that last few minutes or it will 
start to break up into flakes. It is excellent poached or lightly 
powdered with rice flour and pan fried. This fish is not suitable for 
"whole fish" recipes because of its large head and skin shrink.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Mexican Rockfish occasionally appears in the 
Philippine fish markets here in Los Angeles, but is probably not common 
far from the coast, as the rockfish fishery along the Pacific coast is 
tightly controlled. The photo specimen was bought from a large Philippine 
market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock), sold as Empire Snapper, which it 
most certainly isn't. Cost was 2016 US $2.99 per pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with very small scales that 
scrape off fairly easily and do not fly about much.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There's nothing unusual in cleaning this fish 
(see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Method</b></a>), but the esophagus 
is large and quite strong, so cut it off with kitchen shears. The gills 
are large and fairly firmly attached, but need not be pulled as the head 
is of no use.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Mexican Rockfish is fairly easy to fillet, with 
an easy to follow fin ray and bone structure, and the flesh holds together 
well. First cut off the head, turning the knife steeply under the gill 
covers to get the maximum amount of flesh. Outline the fillet by cutting 
through the skin along the top, across the tail and especially along the 
bottom - cut a little deep and you can just pull the anal fin out. Cut 
from the top down following the bones to the backbone. Hop over the 
backbone at the tail and work forward. When you get to the ribcage just 
cut the ribs loose from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them 
from the fillet with long nose pliers. Hold the flesh with your fingers 
on each side of the rib so it doesn't tear the flesh. There are some 
very substantial centerline pinbones for the length of the body cavity 
but they are easy to locate. Pull them straight forward, again holding 
the flesh in place. <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is severe, and it doesn't release 
from the flesh even when when cooked into jelly. The skin is thin but 
quite strong, and it's adhesion is poor. You can almost peel it off, 
so it's very easy to remove by the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Almost no flesh should 
be lost. I recommend simply cutting off the thin part of the skirt 
before skinning, as it will not contribute much flesh, and the 
unremovable membrane on the inside will cause it to curl strongly.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is not high, because so much of this fish 
is head. A 1 pound 14-3/4 ounce fish yielded 11-1/4 ounces of skin on 
fillets (37%), but they usually need to be skinned, which would be 9-1/8 
ounces (30%), presuming the thin part of the skirt is cut off.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones, simmered slowly for 40 
minutes, produced a murky stock with a strong smell and taste. I recommend 
you don't bother.</p>
