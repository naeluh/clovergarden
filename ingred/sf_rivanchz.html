[River Anchovy (marketing); Ca Com Song (Viet); Trey bawndol ampeou 
(Khmer); <i>Corica laciniata</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to rivers, estuaries and lagoons opening into the 
Gulf of Thailand, also in the Mekong Basin and in rivers of southern 
Borneo, Indonesia. It can grow to 2-3/4 inches, but the photo specimen
was 2.16 inches. Largest in the batch was a giant, 2.4 inches long.</p>
<p>These fish are extremely delicate, and it was difficult for me to 
find a specimen in the tray without its belly burst open. I did not try 
to extend the pelvic fins, which you can see the tips of at the back end 
of the belly, for fear of bursting it open.</p>

<p>The main use for these fish is to make Prahoc, a fermented fish 
sauce, usually made from fresh water fish.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimens, from Vietnam, were 
purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), 
frozen in a 14 ounce tray for 2018 US $3.29.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; I certainly couldn't make Prahoc with so few 
fish, so I just spread them in my electric dehydrator and dried them 
for use as dried anchovies.<p></p>
