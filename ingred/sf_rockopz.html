[Longjaw Rockfish, Pacific Ocean Perch; <i>Sebastes alutus</i>]
<p>
This Pacific rockfish, easily recognized by the nubby protrusion on it's 
lower lip (no, it isn't a cold sore) is found from the northern tip of 
Japan all the way around and down to San Diego, California but is most 
opulous along the south coast and islands of Alaska and around the 
Kamchatka Peninsula. This fish can live for about 100 years and can grow 
to 21 inches and 4.6  pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-1/4 inches 
and weighed 1 pounds 15 ounces.</p>
<p> This fish can occasionally be found in Asian fish markets in Southern 
California. As with all rockfish it is wild caught and this fish is 
currently considered severely overfished. IUCN Red List NE (Not 
Evaluated)</p>

<p>Pacific Ocean Perch is an excellent eating fish (when fresh) with near 
white, moderately flavored flesh that is tender but holds together well 
with any cooking method. It separates into large flakes and it's easy to 
eliminate all bones.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; No particular problems cleaning this fish. The 
scales are fairly large and easy to scrape off without a lot of flying around. 
There are a few that stick hard on the lateral line and would need to be 
pulled off with long nose pliers only if you intend to leave the skin on.</p>
<p>Use your filleting knife, sharp edge out, to cut from the vent to the 
fins, then your kitchen shears to cut from the fins up to the chin. You 
will have to use your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus and the bottom 
end of the gill arches.</p>

<p><b>Fillet: </b> &nbsp; Ocean Perch is rather easy to fillet, with easy 
to follow fin rays and bones.</p> 

<ol>
<li>The head is large and wide and I prefer to remove it before filleting. 
When you make the cut around the collar tilt the knife steeply under the 
collar to get as much flesh as possible. Go behind the pectoral fins and 
in front of the bottom (pelvic) fins (cut them from the fillet later). 
There is one rib you will need to cut below the pectoral fins. Cut the 
backbone with kitchen shears going in from the underside of the fish.
</li>
<li>Make the cuts on either side of the anal fin and the top cut down to 
the backbone. Free the fillet from the tail forward to the body cavity, 
use your kitchen shears to cut the rib cage away from the spine so you 
can deal with the ribs on the fillet.</li>
<li>Pull the ribs up and a little forward with long nose pliers using 
your fingers to hold the flesh in place. They pull out a little harder 
than some other fish, but I still think this is the best plan. Once 
you've pulled the ribs from the fillet you'll find a row of substantial 
pin bones down the centerline from the front for the full length of the 
body cavity. Use your long nose pliers to pull these out forward and a 
little down..</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is strong, thick and gelatinous, but 
doesn't have a strong or unpleasant taste. Unfortunately it shrinks very 
severely when heated and it'll curl your fillets into a tight roll. 
Fortunately it's a very easy fish to skin using the long knife and 
cutting board method. Keep the knife edge tilted a little more toward 
the skin than with a fish with a more tender skin.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 15 ounce fish yielded fillets weighing 
15-1/8 ounces skin-on fillet (49%), 13 ounces skin-off (42%), which is very 
good for a large head fish like this. A smaller fish will yield a bit less, 
a larger fish a bit more.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a moderate flavored 
stock suitable for soup. The skins would probably also be usable as they don't 
have a strong taste. Use plenty of water and bring it to a boil in an 
open pot. As it nears boiling use a skimmer to remove the heavy foam. Once 
it's boiling set it to a low simmer for 1/2 hour.</p>
