[Red Bandit, <i>Sebastes babcocki</i>]
<p>
This Pacific rockfish is found from the northern tip of Japan all the way 
around and down to San Diego, California but is most populous along the 
south coast and islands of Alaska. It can grow to 25 inches and almost 10 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 3 pounds. It is sold in 
Asian markets in Southern California, often labeled "Red Bandit". Colors 
may be lighter than on the photo specimen. A slow growing fish of 
moderate population, it's mainly an incidental catch and unlikely to be 
found in markets far from the Pacific Coast. &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

<p>Redbanded Rockfish is an excellent eating fish (when fresh) with white, 
moderately flavored flesh that is tender but holds together well with any 
cooking method. It separates into large flakes and it's easy to eliminate 
all bones.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; No particular problems cleaning this fish. The 
scales are fairly large and easy to scrape off without a lot of flying around. 
There are a few that stick hard on the lateral line and would need to be 
pulled off with long nose pliers only if you intend to leave the skin on.</p>
<p>Use your filleting knife, sharp edge out, to cut from the vent to the 
fins, then your kitchen shears to cut from the fins up to the chin. You 
will have to use your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus and the ends of 
the gill arches, and a few other spots, mainly because this is a 
large fish.</p>

<p><b>Fillet: </b> &nbsp; Redbanded Rockfish is rather easy to fillet, with 
easy to follow fin rays and bones.</p> 

<ol>
<li>The head is large and wide and I prefer to remove it before filleting. 
When you make the cut around the collar tilt the knife steeply under the 
collar to get as much flesh as possible. Go behind the pectoral fins and 
in front of the bottom fins (cut them from the fillet later). There is one 
rib you will need to cut below the pectoral fins. Cut the spine with kitchen 
shears going in from the underside of the fish.</li>
<li>Make the cuts on either side of the anal fin and the top cut down to 
the backbone. Free the fillet from the tail forward to the body cavity, 
use your kitchen shears to cut the rib cage away from the spine so you can 
deal with the ribs on the fillet.</li>
<li>Pull the ribs up and forward with long nose pliers using your fingers 
to hold the flesh in place. Once you've pulled the ribs from the fillet 
you'll find a row of substantial spines down the centerline from the front 
for the full length of the body cavity. Use your long nose pliers to pull 
these out straight forward.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks severely when heated (as does the 
membrane lining the body cavity) but it's a very easy fish to skin using 
the long knife and cutting board technique. While skin must be removed from 
fillets so it will not destroy them, you can bake a moderate size fish whole, 
but do make a few diagonal slashes half way through the flesh so the skin 
won't tear it up and make it look really ugly. Those cuts will open up wide, 
but that just lets the sauce in.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound ounce fish yielded fillets weighing 
1 pound 3 ounces of skin-off fillet (39%), which is not bad for a large 
head fish like this. A smaller fish will yield a bit less, a larger fish 
a bit more. There's a couple more ounces of flesh with the head and fins 
but you'd need to do a short simmer to recover it.</p>
