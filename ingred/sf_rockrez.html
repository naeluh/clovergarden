[Blacktip Rockcod; <i>Sebastes aleutianus</i>]
<p>
This Pacific rockfish is found from the northern tip of Japan all the way 
around and down to San Diego, California but is most populous along the 
south coast and islands of Alaska and off the coast of Washington state. 
It gets its name from a row of tiny spines found right under the eyes. 
This fish can live for over 140 years and can grow to 38 inches and 19 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 19 inches and 3 pounds 4 ounces. It 
can often be found in Asian groceries in Southern California. Fishing 
regulations for rockfish are quite strict, limiting supply, so they are 
unlikely to be found in markets far from the Pacific Coast. </p>

<p>Rougheye Rockfish is an excellent eating fish with white, moderately 
flavored flesh that is tender but holds together well with any cooking 
method. It's easy to eliminate all the bones, and on the plate it separates 
easily into large flakes.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; No particular problems cleaning this fish. The 
scales are fairly large and easy to scrape off without a lot of flying around. 
There are a few that stick hard on the lateral line and would need to be 
pulled off with long nose pliers only if you intend to leave the skin on.</p>
<p>Use your filleting knife, sharp edge out, to cut from the vent to the 
fins, then your kitchen shears to cut from the fins up to the chin. You 
will have to use your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus and the ends of 
the gill arches, and a few other spots, mainly because this is a 
large fish.</p>

<p><b>Fillet: </b> &nbsp; Rougheye Rockfish is rather easy to fillet, with 
easy to follow fin rays and bones.</p> 

<ol>
<li>The head is large and wide and I prefer to remove it before filleting. 
When you make the cut around the head tilt the knife steeply under the 
collar to get as much flesh as possible. Go behind the pectoral fins and 
in front of the pelvic (bottom) fins - cut them from the fillet later. 
There is one rib bone below the pectoral fins you will need to cut with 
kitchen shears, and of course the backbone, going in from the underside 
of the fish.</li>
<li>Make the cuts on either side of the anal fin and the top cut down to 
the backbone. Free the fillet from the tail forward to the body cavity, 
use your kitchen shears to cut the rib cage away from the spine so you can 
deal with the ribs on the fillet.</li>
<li>Pull the ribs up and forward with long nose pliers using your fingers 
to hold the flesh in place. Once you've pulled the ribs from the fillet 
you'll find a row of substantial spines down the centerline from the front 
for the full length of the body cavity. Use your long nose pliers to pull 
these out straight forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the skirt area often has a strong "off" flavor, particularly if 
the inside lining is dark and muddy looking. If so, it should be discarded.
</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks severely when heated (as does the 
membrane lining the body cavity) but it's a very easy fish to skin using 
the long knife and cutting board technique. While skin must be removed from 
fillets so it will not destroy them, you can bake a moderate size fish whole, 
but do make a few diagonal slashes half way through the flesh so the skin 
won't tear it up and make it look really ugly. Those cuts will open up wide, 
but that just lets the sauce in.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish holds together well enough for all common 
methods of cooking. If you poach fillets, even though they have been 
skinned they will curl fairly strongly to the skin side. It is best to 
split them in half lengthwise and have long pieces rather than wide pieces. 
If pan frying, keep in mind these fillets, especially at the head end, are 
very thick, so fry over rather low heat so they're cooked through by time 
they're browned.
</p>


<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 3-3/4 ounce fish yielded fillets weighing 
1 pound 8-1/4 ounces skin-on fillet (47%), 1 pound 6-1/8 ounces skin-off 
(43%), which is very good for a large head fish like this. A smaller fish 
will yield a bit less, a larger fish a bit more.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a light flavored stock 
that would be quite desirable, except it's murky and a gray-brown color that 
isn't at all attractive.</p>
