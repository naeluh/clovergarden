[<i>Sebastes reedi</i>]
<p>
This Pacific rockfish is found all along the Aleutian Island chain down 
   to northern California, living in deep water over rough bottoms. It can 
   live to 100 years and can grow to 22 inches, but the photo specimen was 
   18-1/2 inches and 3 pounds 6 ounces. This fish is rather rare in the 
   Asian markets here in Southern California. Fishing regulations for 
   rockfish are quite strict, limiting supply, so they are unlikely to be 
   found in markets far from the Pacific Coast. &nbsp;

<p>Yellowmouth Rockfish is an excellent eating fish with white, moderately 
flavored flesh that holds together well with any cooking method - 
sometimes a little too well. It flakes apart reluctantly into very large 
flakes and it can be almost a little chewy. Definitely it'll hold up in 
soups. As an overall impression, it is much like cod.</p> 

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish holds together very well, so is 
suitable for all common methods of cooking. If you poach fillets, even 
though they have been skinned they will curl moderately to the skin side. 
It is best to split them in half lengthwise and have long pieces rather 
than wide pieces. If pan frying, keep in mind these fillets, especially 
at the head end, are very thick, so fry over rather low heat so they're 
cooked through by time they're browned. Coat lightly with rice flour to 
prevent sticking to the pan.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are medium size with fairly good 
adhesion. They scrape off with a bit of effort and fly around moderately. 
In some spots the scales may simply fold over rather than scrape off. In 
these areas just pull them off with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; 
<p>Use your filleting knife, sharp edge out, to cut from the vent to the 
fins, then your kitchen shears to cut from the fins up to the chin. You 
will have to use your kitchen shears to cut the esophagus and the ends of 
the gill arches, and a few other spots because this is a large fish and 
the gills are large and pull rather hard.</p>

<p><b>Fillet: </b> &nbsp; Yellowmouth Rockfish has a complete and orderly 
bone structure making it very easy to fillet.</p> 

<ol>
<li>The head is large and wide and I prefer to remove it before filleting. 
When you make the cut around the head tilt the knife steeply under the 
collar to get as much flesh as possible. Go behind the pectoral fins and 
in front of the pelvic (bottom) fins - cut them from the fillet later. There 
is one rib bone below the pectoral fins you will need to cut with kitchen 
shears, and of course the backbone, going in from the underside of the fish.
</li>
<li>Make the cuts on either side of the anal fin and the top cut down to 
the backbone. Free the fillet from the tail forward to the body cavity, 
use your kitchen shears to cut the rib cage away from the spine so you can 
deal with the ribs on the fillet.</li>
<li>Pull the ribs up and forward with long nose pliers using your fingers 
to hold the flesh in place. The ribs pull rather hard and try to tear up 
the flesh. Once you've pulled the ribs from the fillet 
you'll find a row of substantial spines down the centerline from the front 
for the full length of the body cavity. Use your long nose pliers to pull 
these out straight forward.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> The skirt area is best cut off and used separately because 
the inside membrane shrinks severely and cannot be removed. While fairly 
meaty, it can have an "off" flavor, depending on the condition of the 
fish, If the lining is glossy gray-black it is likely OK, but if muddy 
looking it should be discarded.
</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin does not have a strong or off flavor, but 
it shrinks severely when heated. This is, however, a very easy fish to 
skin using the long knife and cutting board technique. It is best to skin 
the skirts (if used) separately as they make the fillet very wide. While 
skin must be removed from fillets so it will curl them into a sausage 
shape, you can bake a moderate size fish whole, but do make a few diagonal 
slashes half way through the flesh so the skin won't tear it up and make 
it look really ugly. Those cuts will open up wide, but that just lets the 
sauce in.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 6 ounce fish yielded fillets weighing 
1 pound 8-3/8 ounces skin-on (45%), 1 pound 6 ounces skin-off (41%), which 
is very good for a large head fish like this. A smaller fish will yield a 
bit less, a larger fish a bit more.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins (the skins could also be 
used), simmered slowly for 1/2 hour,make a light flavored stock that is 
quite usable, but is not quite clear so it should not be used for 
applications requiring a very clear stock. The stock has a moderate amount 
of oil which should be removed using your gravy separator.</p>
