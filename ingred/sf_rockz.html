<h1>Rockfish / Scorpionfish Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_idiot11g.jpg" alt="Whole Idiot Fish" class=mrg>
[Rockfish, family <i>Scorpaenidae</i>, family <i>Sebastidae</i>]
<p>
Some biologists lump all these fish under <i>Scorpaenidae</i>  
(Scorpionfishes) and some assign a number of genera to <i>Sebastidae</i>, 
a family not recognized at all by the first group. They are mostly 
venomous (poisoned spines) ranging from extremely to not much. 
Fortunately those off the Pacific coast of California fall in the "not 
much" range.</p>
<p>Popularly, rockfish are called names like "Sculpin" and "Rock Cod" but 
none are members of those families. They are popular eating fish ranging 
from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to the tip of Baja California, 
Mexico, though each species has a more limited range.</p>

<h2>Acadian Redfish</h2>
<img src="img/sf_acadred01e.jpg" alt="Whole Acadian Redfish 01e" class=mrg>
[<i>Sebastes fasciatus</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to shallow waters in the North Atlantic. It is 
most common from Maine, USA north around Nova Scotia, but lesser 
populations are found as far south as Virginia, and off southern Greenland 
and around Iceland. It grows to about 12 inches long, and was not 
previously considered a prime commercial catch. There is now some effort 
to market it, as the Cod and Haddock fisheries decline. It is IUCN Red 
Listed EN (Endangered). It was seriously overfished, but with regulation 
in place, stocks have largely recovered.

<img src="img/sf_rfbococ03e.jpg" alt="Whole Bococcio Rockfish 03e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Sebastes paucispinis</i>]
<p>
This rockfish is found from along the Aleutian Islands of Alaska down to 
at least the Mexican border. It can grow to nearly 36 inches and 21 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 21 inches and 4 pounds, a little larger than 
average market size. This is a prized eating fish but it's IUCN Red Listed 
as CE (Critically Endangered) and the catch is restricted in California. 
Commercially Bococcio fillets are often mixed in with fillets of other 
rockfish.

<img src="img/sf_rfmexi03e.jpg" alt="Whole Mexican Rockfish 03e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Sebastes macdonaldi</i>
<p>
This rockfish is found from Santa Barbara, California, down to the tip 
of Baja California, Mexico, and in the Gulf of Mexico. It can grow to 
26 inches and 6 pounds, but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 1 
pound 14-3/4 ounces. This excellent eating fish and popular game 
fish is IUCN Red listed NE (Not Evaluated) and not considered 
endangered.

<img src="img/sf_scorpion11e.jpg" alt="Whole California Scorpionfish 11e" class=mrg></a>
[Sculpin, <i>Scorpaena guttata</i>]
<p>
Commonly called "Sculpin" (which it is not), this fish is found from the 
central coast of California to the central cost of Baja California and 
the northern half of the Gulf of California, a rather short range as fish 
go. It can grow to 17 inches but the photo specimen was 14 inches and 
weighed just under 2 pounds 2 ounces.

<img src="img/sf_rockcan07e.jpg" alt="Whole Canary Rockfish 07e" class=mrg></a>
[Orange Rockfish, Rockcod, <i>Sebastes pinniger</i>]
<p>
One of the many varieties of deep water rockfish caught all along the 
Pacific coast, Canary Rockfish is found from Baja California to the 
Gulf of Alaska. They can grow to 29 inches and 10 pounds, but the photo 
specimen was 23 inches and 5 pounds 12-1/8 ounces. This fish is 
sometimes more orange than the one in the photo, and sometimes more 
yellow.

<h2>Idiot Fish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_idiotz.html">
<img src="img/sf_idiot11e.jpg" alt="Whole Idiot Fish 11e" class=mrg></a>
[Shortspine Thornyhead, <i>Sebastolobus alascanus</i>]
<p>
A variety of Scorpion Fish particularly 
adapted to the deep "oxygen minimum" layer of the ocean where most fish can 
not thrive. It has a huge head, both long and wide, housing very large gills. 
It lives in the North Pacific, some as far south as the Mexican border 
but mostly Northern California, Washington State, Canada and Russia, but as 
far south as northern Japan. This fish can grow to 31 inches and 20 pounds 
but the photo specimen was 21 inches and 4-3/4 pounds, towards the large 
end of market size.</p>
<p>Living under very sub-optimal conditions the Idiot Fish grows slowly and 
has a slow propagation rate. The U.S. fishery is tightly regulated under 
Federal fisheries programs to avoid overfishing, consequently it's not found 
far from the Pacific coast. Of course it's strange spiny appearance is sort 
of off-putting for many people anyway, which is just as it should be because 
there will be more for me.  Outside the U.S. Pacific coast regulation may be 
deficient and the IUCN Red List status is EN (Endangered).

<h2 class=lrg>Ocean Perch</h2>
<p>The fish in this subcategory are commonly called "Ocean Perch", but 
this name is not valid, these fish are all Rockfish in family 
<i>Sebastidae</i> and are not related to actual Perch. Strangely, the
<a href="sf_rockz.html#acad">Acadian Redfish</a>, while closely related to the 
Atlantic Ocean Perch and Beaked Redfish, and sharing part of their 
range, is not called "Ocean Perch".

   [Longjaw Rockfish, Pacific Ocean Perch; <i>Sebastes alutus</i>]
   <p>
   This Pacific rockfish, easily recognized by the nubby protrusion on it's 
   lower lip (no, it isn't a cold sore) is found from the northern tip of 
   Japan all the way around and down to San Diego, California but is most 
   populous along the south coast and islands of Alaska and around the 
   Kamchatka Peninsula. This fish can live for about 100 years and can grow 
   to 21 inches and 4.6  pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-1/4 inches 
   and weighed 1 pounds 15 ounces.</p>
   <p> This fish can occasionally be found in Asian fish markets in Southern 
   California. As with all rockfish it is wild caught and this fish is 
   currently considered overfished. IUCN Red List status is "Not Evaluated".

   [Golden Redfish (fishbase); Rose Fish, Atlantic Redfish, Norway 
   Haddock, Red Perch, Red Bream, Hemdurgan; <i>Sebastes norvegicus</i>; 
   <i>Sebastes marinus</i> (in error)]
   <p>
   This deep water fish is native to the far north of the North Atlantic. 
   In the West Atlantic it ranges from Labrador, Canada, south to New 
   Jersey, USA, then around southern Greenland and Iceland. In the East 
   Atlantic, it ranges from Portugal north to Spitsbergen and 
   Novaya Zemlya. It can grow to 39 inches and 33 pounds, but is commonly 
   about 18 inches long. The main fishery region is between Iceland 
   and Greenland. It is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated), but it is 
   considered severely overfished in that region, and it is uncertain 
   if stocks can recover. This fish is most commonly sold as frozen 
   fillets. There have been reports of ciguatera poisoning from this 
   fish.

   <p>
   This deep water fish is native to the far north of the North Atlantic, 
   from Baffin Bay, Canada, south to Nova Scotia, around southern Greenland 
   and Iceland, east to Norway and north to Spitsbergen. It can grow to 
   almost 23 inches long, and is fished mainly by Norway and Russia. IUCN 
   Red Listed LC (Least Concern), but stocks have been depleted to the 
   point Norway has banned taking this fish except as by-catch.

[Red Bandit (Asian markets); <i>Sebastes babcocki</i>]
<p>
This Pacific rockfish is found from the northern tip of Japan all the way 
around and down to San Diego, California but is most populous along the 
south coast and islands of Alaska. It can grow to 25 inches and almost 10 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 17 inches and 3 pounds. It is sold in 
Asian groceries in Southern California labeled "Red Bandit". Colors may be 
lighter than on the photo specimen. A slow growing fish of moderate 
population, it's mainly an incidental catch and unlikely to be found in 
markets far from the Pacific Coast.

<p>
This Pacific rockfish is found from the northern tip of Japan all the way 
around and down to San Diego, California but is most populous along the 
south coast and islands of Alaska and off the coast of Washington state. 
It gets its name from a row of tiny spins found right under  the eyes. 
This fish can live for over 140 years and can grow to 38 inches and 19 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 19 inches and 3 pounds 4 ounces. It 
can occasionally be found in Asian groceries in Southern California. Fishing 
regulations for rockfish are quite strict, limiting supply, so they are 
unlikely to be found in markets far from the Pacific Coast.

[<i>Sebastes ovalis</i>]
<p>
This rockfish is found in the east Pacific from San Francisco south to 
northern Baja California, Mexican, but is rare north of Santa Barbara. 
It can grow to nearly 22 inches and 2 pounds, but the photo specimen 
12-1/2 inches and 14-3/4 ounces. This is a prized eating fish 
and is IUCN Red Listed as NE (Not Evaluated), as with other rockfish, 
the catch is regulated by the state of California. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, labeled 
"Gother Cod", a misspelling of "Gopher Cod" (rockfish are often called 
"rock cod"), but it wasn't a Gopher Rockfish either, though of similar 
appearance.

This rockfish is found from along the Aleutian Islands of Alaska down 
to the tip of Baja California, Mexico, but is not common south of the 
Canadian border. It can grow to 28 inches and a little over 10 pounds, 
but the photo specimen, purchased from a large Asian market in 
Los Angeles, was 14-3/4 inches and weighed 1 pound 3-1/4 
ounces. This is considered a very fine eating fish  IUCN Red Listed 
as NE (Not Evaluated). As with all rockfish, the catch is regulated 
in California and probably in the northern states as well. This fish 
is often tossed in with other rockfish of similar color, and this fish 
was mixed with Speckled Rockfish described above, but neither one was 
"Gother cod" as labeled.

This rockfish is found from mid British Columbia, Canada south to mid 
Baja California, Mexico. It can grow to nearly 36 inches and 15 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 17-1/2 inches and 3-1/2 pounds, about normal 
market size. It's a prized eating fish, but, as with other rockfish, 
the fishery is tightly regulated so it is available mainly along 
the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Canada.
