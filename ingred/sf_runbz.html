[Bluestripe Jack, Hardtail Jack, Egyptian Scad; <i>Caranx  crysos</i>]
<p>
Belonging to the same family as Pompanos, Blue Runners are found 
close to coasts and reefs on both sides of the Atlantic and in the 
Mediterranean. They range from the southern tip of England to Angola, 
and from Nova Scotia, Canada, to northern Brazil, including 
the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. They can grow to nearly 28 inches 
and 11 pounds, but the photo specimen was fairly typical at 14 inches 
and weighing 1 pound 1-1/2 oz. This fish is a minor commercial catch, 
and is IUCN rated LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p>Blue Runner is not considered a prime market fish, due to the high 
amount of dark meat, and dealing with the scutes, so it is available at 
a very good price. The majority of the flesh is medium color and has a 
good medium flavor, but the dark streak down the center is both wide 
and deep, with a stronger flavor. While I find this quite acceptable, 
it will not be favored by neophytes who want their fish "white and 
lite".</p>

<p>The flesh is very tender raw, but firms up with cooking, so it's 
suitable for wet cooking. The flesh flakes apart easily on the plate. 
Fillets work fine pan fried skin-on with a light dusting of rice 
flour, but for poaching I prefer fillets skinned, as the skin 
becomes mushy with wet cooking.</p> 

<p><b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; The row of hard scutes along the lateral line at 
the tail needs to be cut away before cooking - just the straight part, 
they are no bother from the start of the curve forward. If not removed, 
they will come loose in cooking and make your eating experience much 
less enjoyable. They will also interfere with skinning if you wish to 
skin fillets.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is often available in the Philippine 
markets. Filipinos are quite accustomed to dealing with fish others may 
consider difficult. The photo specimen was purchased from a Philippine 
market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2016 US $1.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Blue Runner scales are tiny and easy to scrape 
off without any flying about.  I suggest cutting out the hard scutes at 
the tail at this point. Make a shallow cut under them from both sides 
and peel off as a strip.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp;  Nothing unusual here, except the body 
cavity extends a ways aft of the vent.  The throat is tough and will 
have to be cut with kitchen shears. Use your long nose pliers for 
pulling the gills.</p> 

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish fillets easily, having a coherent 
bone structure to follow. Handle gently, as the flesh is very tender 
when raw. I start by cutting off the head, as this fish will not 
usually be cooked head-on. When you get to the rib cage, cut the ribs 
from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet 
with long nose pliers - they will almost fall out of the tender flesh. 
There are substantial centerline pin bones for the length of the body 
cavity, which must be pulled out straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has little shrink when heated, so fillets 
can be fried skin-on. Fillets can even be poached skin-on, but I prefer 
not, as the skin becomes mushy. The skin is easy to remove using the 
standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The main problem is the 
skin at the tail end will be cut in half by removing the scutes, making 
it fragile and very difficult to hold on to. Consider starting skinning 
from the top point of the front.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1-1/2 pound fish yielded about 12.2 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (51%), and 11 ounces of skinless fillet (46%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Head bones and fins make a good medium flavored 
stock with little oil. I have not included skins when making stock from 
this fish. Remove what oil there is using your gravy separator. For 
details see our

<p><b>Health &amp; Nutrition</b> &nbsp; In the Virgin Islands reef 
environment, larger fish, probably well over 14 inches, have been 
reported to cause ciguatera poisoning.</p>
