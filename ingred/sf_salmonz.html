<h1>Salmon</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_salmon09g.jpg" alt="Salmon, cut for sale" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Salmonidae</i>, Genus <i>Oncorhynchus</i> (Pacific) and 
<i>Salmo</i> (Atlantic) species]
<p>
Salmon are large seagoing Trout. Actually all Trout are Salmonidae but 
we've broken out those not called Salmon to a <a href="sf_salmonz.html#trout">Trout</a> 
heading for clarity, Salmon live most of their lives in the deep oceans 
but return to the river of their birth to spawn - and then die. Why they 
die I do not know, other fish of the same genus, even seagoing ones, 
survive spawning (so are classed as Trout). Atlantic salmon have a high 
mortality at spawning but some survive.</p>

<h3 id="var">The Main Species of Salmon</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Chinook / King</b> &nbsp; (<i>Oncorhynchs tshawytscha</i>) which 
    is the largest, fattiest, and most flavorful may weigh up to 125 
    pounds. Flesh may vary from ivory to deep red depending on diet.
  <li><b>Jack Salmon</b> &nbsp;  A Chinook that has returned to fresh 
    water a year or two early and is still a smaller size. Note that in 
    Europe this name is used for a pike perch similar to our walleye.</li>
  <li><b>Chum</b> &nbsp; (<i>Oncorhynchus keta</i>) are smaller salmon 
    weighing up to 10 pounds with creamy pink to medium red flesh that 
    has a mild, delicate flavor.</li>
  <li><b>Pink</b> &nbsp; (<i>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</i>) is the smallest 
    salmon, weighing up to 5 pounds and the most plentiful. The flesh is 
    light pink and delicate in flavor.</li>
  <li><b>Coho</b> &nbsp; (Silver, <i>O. kisutch</i>) weighs up to 15 
    pounds with a medium lean firm flesh with a fine texture and 
    consistently red color.</li>
  <li><b>Sockeye</b> (Red, <i>O. nerka</i>) weighs up to 7 pounds at 
    maturity. It is highly sought after for its very lean deep red flesh.
    </li>
  <li><b>Masu</b> &nbsp; (yamame, <i>O. masou</i>) - Asia only.</li>
  <li><b>Amago</b> &nbsp; (biwamasu, <i>O. rhodurus</i>) - Asia only.</li>
  <li><b>Seema</b> &nbsp; (<i>O. masou</i>) - Asia only.</li>
  <li><b>Atlantic</b> &nbsp; (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is no longer marketed 
    wild in any quantity, the population having been decimated on both 
    sides of the Atlantic by pollution and overfishing. It is the 
    preferred farm salmon on the West Coast of North America, as it is 
    more tolerant of crowded conditions.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Pink Salmon</h2>
<br><a href="sf_salmpkz.html">
<img src="img/sf_salmpk02e.jpg" alt="Whole Pink Salmon" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</i>]
<p>This is the smallest, and most numerous, of the Wild Salmon. It 
inhabits the Arctic Ocean from above western Canada, Alaska and eastern 
Siberia. It is most numerous on the south side of Alaska, and extends 
down to Korea in Asia, and the Sacramento River in California, and 
sometimes farther south.

<h2 id="wild">Wild Salmon</h2> 
<p>Leaner and with a more complex flavor than 
farmed salmon, wild is in short supply and will cost at least three times as 
much per pound as farmed salmon. Keeping the price and flavor in mind you 
should not use complex recipes that will mask the flavor and texture of the 
fish or you might as well use farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon may be caught in rivers and estuaries in nets or at sea 
on troll lines. Troll fishermen say their fish are handled more carefully 
than netted so are more consistent in quality.</p>
<p>Wild salmon vary considerable om size,even within a species because 
they reach sexual maturity at a variety of ages. There is also a quality 
difference within each species depending on which river they are 
associated with, but information on that is currently very unreliable.</p> 

<h2 id="farm">Farmed Salmon</h2>

<p>Salmon are both fast growing and in great demand by consumers, which 
makes them prime subjects for fish farming. Farming does have ecological 
impacts, particularly from escaped fish (greatly reduced in recent years) 
and an economic impact from reducing the price wild salmon can fetch.</p>
<p>Many food writers campaign against farmed salmon and urge you to 
buy only wild salmon - but lets look at reality. The wild catch, 
worldwide, is less than 1 million tons. Worldwide farm production 
is well over 2 million tons. Without farmed salmon wild salmon would 
be so expensive it would all be shipped to Japan where an absurdly 
high price is considered a major enhancement to dining pleasure.</p>
<p> Farmed salmon are predominantly Atlantic salmon, even in Pacific 
coast farms, because they are less aggressive than Pacific salmon and 
produce a higher yield. A fair amount of Pacific salmon is still farmed 
and is considered preferable because ecological damage from fish 
escaping into the Pacific is very small.</p>
<p>Salmon flesh is normally a light gray color, but consumers demand the 
red color of returning ocean fish. To achieve this the farms add 
carotenoid dyes to the feed of maturing fish. These are the same dyes 
wild fish acquire from eating crustaceans.</p>
<p>For grilling, many people prefer farmed salmon over wild because it 
is fattier and easier to grill.  Farmed salmon is generally free of 
tapeworms, nematodes and other parasites.</p>


<h2 id="gmo">Genetically Modified Salmon</h2>

<p>The company AquaBounty Technologies of Maynard, Massachusetts has 
developed a "transgenic" farmed salmon that grows twice as fast normal 
salmon by modifying its genetic code. They have been growing these fish 
at an inland farm in Panama that can produce only about 100 tons a year.
</p>

<p>The FDA has not yet (October 2018) approved these fish for sale in 
the United States, but approval is expected soon, despite strong public 
protest. Sale was approved in Canada May 2016. The FDA has rated these 
fish safe for consumption - but there is simply no data on the long term 
effects of GM foods.</p>

<p>A major concern is ecological. Should these fish escape into the 
oceans, they could very severely effect, even destroy, wild stocks. 
For this reason, only inland farms are likely to be approved in the 
United States - but AquaBounty intends to sell eggs to China, where 
regulation is a joke. They'll be in the oceans within months.</p> 

<p>Fortunately, reproductive success in the wild is rather questionable. 
Even evolutionary scientists have finally (very reluctantly) come to 
realize that sexual preference is perhaps the most powerful factor in 
"survival of the fittest". It is unlikely female salmon will choose 
these rather weak fish, unable to develop the hooked jaw and 
red color that indicate readiness to spawn.</p>

<h2 id="cook">Preparing <small>&amp;</small> Cooking Salmon</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Color</h3>
<br>Salmon are noted for the strong pinkish red color of 
their flesh, the result of carotenoid dyes acquired from a diet of 
crustaceans. While intensity of this color has very little relationship 
to quality, consumer perception is that it is the primary quality marker 
so carotenoid dyes are added to the feed of farm raised salmon.<p></p>

<h3>Raw Salmon</h3>
<br>Raw Salmon is extremely popular in sushi bars, but problems with 
<a href="seafish.html#worm">parasitic worms</a> should be kept in mind. 
Nematode worms can't live long in humans but can cause considerable pain 
for a short time. Tapeworms (from wild river caught salmon) can live 
for years.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<br>Salmon are generally quite large so are usually sold as steaks or 
fillets rather than whole fish. Some of the Asian markets here in Los 
Angeles sell whole "salmon" up to about 30 inches long, but these are 
mostly farmed steelhead trout that have never been to sea. I have, 
however, purchased whole wild Pink Salmon from a Philippine market here 
in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). Split salmon heads are also sold in Asian 
markets for soup stock, and some provide the head along with all the 
fins and bones the fillets have been removed from. The head and bones 
provide a very substantial salmon flavored stock with a large amount of 
oil. When the oil is separated the stock is without any of the orange 
salmon color.<p></p>
<p>Because of its oiliness, salmon is often broiled or grilled, but it 
is also poached for many recipes.</p>
