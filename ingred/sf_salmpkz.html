<h1>Pink Salmon</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_salmpk02g.jpg" alt="Whole Pink Salmon" class=mrg>
[Humpy, Hump Back; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha]
<p>
This is the smallest, and most numerous, of the Wild Salmon. It inhabits 
the Arctic Ocean from above western Canada, Alaska and eastern Siberia. 
It is most numerous on the south side of Alaska, and extends down to 
Korea in Asia, and the Sacramento River in California, and sometimes 
farther south. They were accidently introduced to the American Great 
Lakes, and have established populations there.</p>
<p>Aside from commercial 
catch, these fish are a very popular for sports fishing. The record 
weight is 15 pounds, but they are normally about 20 inches and a little 
under 4 pounds. The photo specimen, a nearly ready to spawn  male, 
wild caught in Canada, was 22 inches long and weighed 4 pounds 3 ounces.
</p> 
<p>These salmon live only two years, spawning and dieing in their second 
year. They are caught mainly during their spawning period (July to 
September) when they return from the sea to fresh water. There are odd 
and even year populations. Sometimes Pink Salmon cross breed with 
Chum Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus keta</i>), producing sterile hybrids called 
Miko Salmon.</p>

<p>The flesh of Pink Salmon is lighter than larger salmon, tender and 
delicate, with a lot less oil. It holds together well for any method of 
cooking. When poached it flakes apart easily at the table into moderately 
thick flakes. When pan fried, it more breaks apart rather than flaking, 
but still does so easily. It is less suitable for grilling than fattier 
salmon. The skin can be left on for any method of cooking. Color will 
vary with the fish's diet, and has no effect on flavor or quality.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I have found whole fish in one of the Philippine 
markets here in Los Angles (Eagle Rock). The photo specimen was 22 
inches long and weighed 4 pounds 3 ounces. It was purchased in late 
August for 2019 US $2.99 per pound, wild caught in Canada. You will 
find only males in the market - the females have been harvested of 
their eggs, then sold as fillets. Only the males get a hump back when 
ready to spawn.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are tiny, soft and thin, scraping off 
almost as a gray slush. I have found it more effective to shave them off 
with the sharp edge of my prep knife rather than scraping in the usual 
manner.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Nothing particularly difficult here except 
the length of the body cavity. There is a long membrane that has to be 
broken through and scraped out, along with the blood works between it 
and the backbone. The gills pull a bit hard and tend to break up, but 
since you're unlikely to cook this fish head-on, you might as well 
remove it right away, dipping the knife under the collar to get the 
most flesh.</p>

<p><b>Ribs:</b> &nbsp; Once you have the fish cleaned, the body cavity 
will open up wide. The ribs are many, thread thin, and long, but they 
are very easy to find and remove. With long nose pliers, just give them 
a little twist to break them from the backbone and pull 
them out. They will give little resistance.</p>

<b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Except for the size, this is not a difficult 
fish to fillet in the usual manner. When you jump over the backbone at 
the tail and work forward, when you get to the body cavity, the ribs 
have already been removed, so just cut the fillet away from the 
backbone. Now for the bad news. There is a row of pinbones for the 
first 2/3s of the fish. You can see them as tiny white dots on the 
fillet. They are a good inch long and almost horizontal pointed toward 
the tail. Fortunately, they are easy to find and pull straight forward 
very easily, taking no flesh.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has a more intense flavor than the 
flesh, but is not at all offensive. It has very little shrink, so pieces 
of fillet can be pan fried or poached skin-on with little or no 
distortion, much like Rainbow Trout. While there is little need to 
remove the skin, it is easily removed using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. It is thin, but 
strong, and can be removed with very little loss of flesh.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 4 pound 2 ounce fish yielded 2 pounds 7 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (66%), very high for a fish. Skin-off that would be 
about 2 pounds 2-1/4 ounces (52%), still decent yield.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins made a lightly flavored 
stock, almost clear with no salmon coloration. There will be quite a bit 
of oil, which you need to remove - use your gravy separator. See our 
recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">Making Fish Stock</a> for 
method, and how to store it.</p>

<p><b>Health &amp; Nutrition:</b> &nbsp; Pink salmon is high in long 
chain omega 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.</p>
