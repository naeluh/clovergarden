[Sailfin Sandfish, <i>Arctoscopus japonicus</i>]
<p>
This fish is found in sandy-muddy bottom areas of the Asian side of the North 
Pacific. In Japan these fish are cultured in captivity, then released for the 
fishery. They grow to as long as 11 inches and 7 ounces. The photo specimen 
was by far the largest from a tray of frozen fish purchased from a Korean 
grocery and was 10 inches long and just over 4 oz.</p>

<p>The distinctly flavored sandfish flesh remains firm even when steamed 
but flakes easy into largish flakes. Once the head and gill covers are 
removed it is mercifully free of the problem bones that plague many small 
fish.</p>

<b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish can occasionally be found in the large 
Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly Hawaii Supermarket which 
has a lot more unusual items than the other Asian markets along Valley 
Boulevard in Alhambra - Sam Gabriel.<p></p>
