<h1>Sardine Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_sardcal07g.jpg" alt="Whole California Sardines" class=mrg>
[family <i>Clupeidae</i> (Herrings)]
<p>
There are many varieties of Sardine, all members of the 
<a href="sf_herrz.html"><b>Herring Family</b></a>, and each variety is 
likely to be known by a number of local names.  Larger fish may be sold 
fresh but many millions are canned every year, packed in water, oil, 
mustard sauce and tomato sauce, with and without hot chilis. Morocco is 
the largest producer of canned sardines in the world, providing 41% of 
the world's exports. Unfortunately, in my opinion, those canned just 
about anywhere else are better.</p>

<h2>Spanish Sardine</h2>
<br><a href="sf_sardspz.html">
<img src="img/sf_spansard03e.jpg" alt="Sardine" class=mrg></a> 
[<i>Sardinella aurita</i>, Round Sardninella (fishbase) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
<i>Sardinella maderensis</i>, Madeiran Sardinella (fishbase)]
<p>
Spanish Sardine is supposed to be <i>S. aurita</i>, but the photo 
specimen, sold as such, looks more like <i>S. maderensis</i> to me.
<i>aurita</i> lives all along both Atlantic coasts, the Caribbean and 
the Mediterranean in both tropical and temperate zones. 
<i>Maderensis</i> is an East Atlantic and Mediterranean fish. While 
both species can grow to over 12 inches, the photo specimen was 
10-1/2 inches long, 3 inches high, 1-1/4 inches thick and weighing 
7-1/2 ounces. These fish are doing reasonably well and do not have 
an at-risk rating, though the Madeiran may be over-fished.

<h2>California Sardine</h2>

[South American Pilchard, <i>Sardinops sagax</i>]
<p>
California is fortunate in having a good supply of these sardines sold 
fresh, but they are also found along both Pacific coasts, in the 
Indian Ocean and on the Atlantic side of South Africa. The photo 
specimens are about 7 inches long and weigh about 2 ounces each.

<h2>Brisling Sardine</h2>
<br><a href="sf_spratz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sprate01e.jpg" alt="European Sprat" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>]
<p>
This fish is not technically a Sardine, thought closely related. European 
Sprats, canned in the same style as Sardines, are called "Brisling 
Sardines" to differentiate them from the heavily smoked canned fish 
widely known as "Sprats".
&nbsp; The <a href="sf_spratz.html"><b>Sprat genus</b></a> 
now has it's own page.

<h2>Canned Sardines</h2>
<br><a href="sf_sardcanz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sardcan02e.jpg" alt="Canned Sardines" class=mrg></a>
There are many varieties of Sardine, all members of the 
<a href="sf_herrz.html"><b>Herring Family</b></a>, and each variety is 
likely to be known by a number of local names. Larger fish may be sold 
fresh but many millions are canned every year, packed in water, oil, 
mustard sauce and tomato sauce, with and without hot chilis.<p></p>
<p>Morocco is the largest producer of canned sardines in the world, 
providing 41% of the world's exports. Personally, I find Moroccan 
sardines often harsh, and prefer those canned just about anywhere else. 
Though the flavor is not always bad, Moroccan sardines are often still 
covered with scales and can range from crumbly to mushy.</p>
<p>I have had excellent canned sardines from Portugal, Spain, Canada, 
Poland and Southeast Asia. Those I use most are from Poland. The two 
brands common around here are Bumblebee and SeaCliff. I prefer Bumblebee 
as SeaCliff are a little too mild for my taste.</p>
<p>Norway was once a major exporter of very fine sardines, but the major 
fishing and packing centers have been replaced by oil refineries since the 
discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea.

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_kapenta05e.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Sardines" class=mrg></a>
[Kapenta, Matembia (Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe)  <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> 
(Lake Tanganyika Sardine) <i>Stolothrissa tanganicae</i> (Lake Tanganyika 
Sprat)]<p>
These two closely related fish are native to Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi. 
The Sardine can grow to 6 inches (15 cm), but is usually around 3-1/2 inches 
(9 cm). The Sprat is smaller, growing to 4 inches (10 cm), but commonly 2-3/4 
inches (7 cm). They are both freshwater sardines, and are of considerable 
nutritional value to people in the region. For details see our

<h2>Philippine Dried Sardine</h2>
<br><a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_daingz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sardda03e.jpg" alt="Whole Dried Sardines" class=mrg></a>
[Tuyo; genus <i>Sardinella</i>]<p>
Many small and tiny fish are salted and dried in the Philippines and 
are generally called <i>Daing</i>, but sardines are important enough 
to have their own name, <i>Tuyo</i>. It is often simply fried whole 
until almost crisp and served with a vinegar dip. Accompanied with 
rice it is a very popular breakfast. &nbsp; For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_daingz.html"><b>Daing, Tuyo</b></a> page.
