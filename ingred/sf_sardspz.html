<i>Sardinella maderensis</i> (fb Maderensis Sardinella)]
<p>
Spanish Sardine is supposed to be <i>S. aurita</i>, but the photo 
specimen, sold as such, looks more like <i>S. maderensis</i> to me.
<i>aurita</i> lives all along both Atlantic coasts, the Caribbean and the 
Mediterranean in both tropical and temperate zones. <i>Maderensis</i> is 
an East Atlantic and Mediterranean fish. While both species can grow to 
over 12 inches, the photo specimen was 10-1/2 inches long, 3 inches high, 
1-1/4 inches thick and weighing 7-1/2 ounces.</p>

<p>This is a rather tasty fish, but almost inedible. It's a very bony fish 
with not a lot of flesh on it, and what there is all full of long, sharp, 
almost invisible pinbones - and it has scutes near the tail as well. I 
suppose this is why they only charge 2008 U.S. $1.29/pound at the local 
Philippine fish market - and that was factory cleaned - gills and guts 
removed.</p>

<p>So what is to be done with such a fish? Well, it's somewhat oily and 
medium strong in flavor, so it's suitable for pickling. An acidic pickle 
will soften all those pinbones into edibility.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with large scales 
that are easy to scrape off without flying around too much.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; The filleting method we use on most fish is 
difficult because all the pinbones resist cutting. The practical way is 
the "one stroke" method. Make a cut behind the head and from there just 
shave the fillet off from head to tail. Go deep at the top and forget 
about anything below the centerline - there's nothing there.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 7-1/2 oz fish yielded only 3 oz (40%), but at 
60 cents per fish it's not that expensive.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin shrinks severely when cooked by any 
method, but if steamed it will soon come loose and can be pulled off 
if desired.</p>

<p><b>Stock</b> &nbsp; The head and bones make a somewhat strong but 
not unpleasant fish stock. There will be a significant amount of oil to 
be separated from the stock - use your gravy separator.</p>
