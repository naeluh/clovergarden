<p>
  This is a "circumtropical" fish found all the way around the world above 
  and below the equator, but its interpretation of the "tropical" part 
  is a bit loose, since it's found as far north as Nova Scotia. It's a 
  nocturnal fish traveling in schools of hundreds of thousands and can 
  grow to 27 inches, but the photo specimen was 11 inches and weighed 9 
  ounces. This fish is kosher and is not threatened. A highly 
  commercial fish, It is both fished wild and farmed.</p>
  <p><i>Selar Boops</i>, which has the same Philippine name, looks a lot 
  like <i>S. crumenophthalmus</i> but is quite a bit smaller (to 11 
  inches) and is restricted to the Southeast Asian region.</p>

<p>This is a highly valued food fish in Asia and the Pacific, but in 
the Caribbean it is used more for bait to catch much larger fish.  
It is a medium flesh fish, not light but very much milder than most 
mackerel. The flesh is tender but it holds together well for all methods 
of cooking if it's not abused. There is a report of possible ciguatera 
poisoning in the Virgin Islands area.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is common in Philippine markets here 
in Los Angles, but it is a fairly expensive for a scad. The photo 
specimen, from Hawaii, was purchased from a Philippine market in 
Eagle Rock for 2016 US $6.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; There are very few scales on this fish and they 
scrape off easily without flying about.</p>

<p><b>Scutes:</b> &nbsp; As with most scad there are hard scutes along 
the lateral line near the tail. They should be cut out before cooking.
<p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; When cleaning you might as well just remove 
and discard the head, as this fish is too strong tasting to make a good 
stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; This is a fairly meaty fish so yield is decent 
with a 9.0 oz fish yielding 4.63 oz of fillet (51%). That's skin-on, but 
the skin is very thin and fragile so better to leave it on as with 
mackerel. A group of fish weighing between 9 and 6.38 ounces yielded 
50%.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Frying a skin-on fillet, the skin shrinks 
noticeably but not enough to cause problems.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp;  This fish is easy to fillet.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scale and clean the fish. Make a cut from the top just behind 
  the head, around the pectoral fins and under the chin. Cut though 
  the backbone using your kitchen shears and remove the head. Note 
  that there is a pair of nasty spines a little forward from the anal 
  fin, so be careful not to get stabbed.</li>
<li>Cut away the pelvic fins using your kitchen shears.</li>
<li>Cut away the scutes in the straight portion of the lateral line. 
  Don't bother with the ones in the arched portion, they're too small 
  to matter. The scutes adhere well so make a very shallow cut under 
  them from both sides and peel off with the attached skin.</li>
<li>Make a cut on each side of the anal fin from the tail to the body 
  cavity.</li>
<li>Cut down to the backbone from the top, from head to tail, and 
  continue the cut below the backbone from behind the cavity to meet the 
  cut you made from the bottom.</li>
<li>Now just peel the fillet off the ribs which will stay with the 
  backbone. For fish larger than 10 inches you may want to use your 
  kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone and pull them from 
  the fillet individually with your long nose pliers. </li>
<li>You'll notice substantial pin bones along the centerline for the 
  length of the body cavity. Use your long nose pliers and pull them 
  straight forward to avoid tearing the flesh.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; This fish is considered to have too strong a 
taste to make a good soup stock.</p>
