[Salay-salay (Philippine); Ca Ngan (Viet); <i>Atule  mate</i>]
<p>
This Indo-Pacific fish is found from the east coast of Africa to Hawaii. 
These fish can grow to nearly 12 inches, but the photo specimen was 
9-1/4 inches and weighed 8 ounces. This is a minor commercial 
catch and is IUCN Red Listed NE (Not Evaluated).
</p>

<p><b>Yellowtail Horse Mackerel</b> (<i>Trachurus novaezelandiae</i>) is 
often confused with this fish, and visa versa, as they are related and 
very similar. I have purchased Yellowtail Scad labeled Yellowtail 
Mackerel. The main visible difference is the Horse Mackerel's lateral 
line descendinb much more abruptly to the forward end of the scutes. 
The instructions given here should work fine with the Yellowtail 
Mackerel. That fish is found around New Zealand and southern Australia, 
most used as bait, but also considered a good eating fish.</p>

<p>This is a delicious fish. My favorite way to eat it is fillets lightly 
powdered with salted rice flour (needed to prevent sticking), pan fried 
in olive pomace oil, and served with my usual 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html"><b>Lemon Wine Sauce</b></a>  
sauce. Note that the flesh, while extremely tender raw, becomes very 
firm with any method of cooking. If you have very small fish, see 
alternatives on our page for

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Like other scads, Yellowtail Scad is found 
mostly in Philippine fish markets. Here in Los Angeles we have one of 
those near every major hospital complex, because our health care system 
runs mainly on Filipino immigrants. Other Asian markets may have them 
in the freezer cases. The photo specimen was purchased at 
a large Philippine market in Eagle Rock, for 2016 US $2.99 / pound.

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; This fish has a modest number of very small 
scales up at the head end. They scrape off easily with no flying around.
<p></p>

<h3>Scutes:</h3> &nbsp; As with other "hard tail" fish, if you are 
going to leave the skin on, you must remove the strip of hard 
"scutes" along the lateral line near the tail. Make a shallow cut just 
through the skin on each side of the scutes for the straight part of 
the lateral line (the curved part is not a problem). Get the tip of 
your fillet knife under the strip at the forward end. Pull it up as 
you shave it off.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Larger fish can be cleaned in the normal 
manner. The gills are not hard to pull, but tend to break up - use 
your long nose pliers. If you aren't cooking the fish head-on, cut 
from the top of the head down behind the pectoral fin and around 
under the chin. Cut through the backbone with your kitchen shears 
and pull the head off. Cut the belly from the vent, forward to under 
the chin, or where the head was if you cut it off. The body cavity 
actually goes farther aft than the vent, but is not too deep to clean 
out easily. Cut off the pelvic fins.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; You can fillet this fish quite easily, as it 
has a coherent, easy to follow bone structure. Remove the head and cut 
off the tail. Make cuts on both sides of the anal fins from the tail end 
forward to the body cavity. Cut down to the backbone, then over it at the 
tail to meet the bottom cuts. When you get forward to the rib cage, for 
small fish you can just pull the fillet off the ribs. For larger fish, 
cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers.  There are centerline pinbones that 
should be pulled out straight forward for the length of the body cavity. 
They are easy to find and easy to pull. Fillets are difficult to skin - 
best to leave the skin on.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin is thin and difficult to remove, and it's 
about all that's holding the tender flesh together. It has significant 
shrink but poor adhesion. If pan frying, when you flip it skin side down, 
immediately (and gently) push the fillet flat with your turner 
for a few seconds. It will remain flat. The skin is not much of a 
problem with poaching either, though you may want to cut the fish in 
half along the centerline.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; The 6-1/2 ounce scad in the top photo yielded 
3.19 ounces of skin-on fillet (49%), a pretty decent yield for a small 
fish, due to it's small head and light bones.I got about the same 
yield from an 8-5/8 ounce fish.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a reasonably clear 
stock which has a distinct but not unpleasant flavor and very moderate 
oil. Use your gravy separator to remove the oil. For details see our
