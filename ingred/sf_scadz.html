[Several genera of family <i>Carangidae</i>]
<p>
"Scad" is a name of convenience for several genera of smaller fish 
within the  huge and very diverse <i>Carangidae</i> family (Jacks, 
Amberjacks, Trevely, Pompano, Moonfish, Jack Mackerels, etc.). 
They resemble mackerel in flavor, but milder and without so much oil. 
These fish are popular in Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, 
so in North Ameica are most available from Philipine markets, though 
they also appear in other Asian markets.

<p>
This is a "circumtropical" fish found all the way around the world 
above and below the equator, but its interpretation of the "tropical" 
part is a bit loose since it's found as far north as Nova Scotia. 
It's a nocturnal fish traveling in schools of hundreds of thousands 
and can grow to 27 inches, but the photo specimen was 11 inches and 
weighed 9 ounces. This fish is kosher and is not threatened.

<i>Decapterus macarellus</i>]
<p>
This fish, found worldwide, is not related to Mackerel, but can be 
treated    similarly except when the Mackerel's oiliness is important 
(smoking, pickling). This fish can grow to 18 inches but the photo 
specimen was 14-3/4 inches long and weighed 1 pound 2-3/8 ounces. 
These fish have just enough scales to be kosher.
