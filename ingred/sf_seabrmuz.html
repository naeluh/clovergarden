<h1>Gilt-head Seabream</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_seabrm03g.jpg" alt="Whole Gilt-head Seabream" class=mrg>
[Dorata (Spain); Orata (Italy); Dorade royale (France); 
<i>Sparus aurata</i> of family <i>Sparidae</i>]
<p>
This fish is native to the Mediterranean, Black Sea and East Atlantic 
from southern Morocco to southern Norway. It is considered a prized 
eating fish throughout its range. Gilt-head comes from the the gold bar 
that extends from one eye to the other, visible in the photo. The photo 
specimen was 12-3/4 inches long and weighed 1 pound 3-3/8 ounces. This 
fish is now farmed, so market fish may come from far outside its 
natural range.

<p>The flesh of this fish is white, with a light and quite pleasant 
taste. There is a narrow darker streak along the centerline right 
beneath the skin. It's texture is a bit different, but the flavor 
not noticeably stronger than the white flesh. Because the flavor is 
quite light, I recommend poaching or steaming this fish, skin-on or 
skin-off. It should be eaten with a lightly flavored sauce or dip. 
I use my standard <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html"><b>Lemon 
Wine Sauce</b></a>. This fish makes an excellent fish stock.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is not common here in Southern 
California, though other Seabream and Porgys are. The photo 
specimen was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2019 U.S. $4.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with thin medium size 
scales with moderate adherence. They are not hard to scrape off and 
don't fly about much.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is a little more difficult to clean 
than some, because of tough membranes and a swim bladder in the body 
cavity. The gills don't pull really hard, but aren't easy to get at, 
so use your long nose pliers. Break the tough membrane at the top of 
the body cavity so you can scrape out the blood works just below the 
backbone. The pliers can also be helpful pulling out membranes.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is an exceptionally easy fish to fillet, 
with a coherent, easy to follow bone structure. Cut down to the backbone, 
then over the backbone at the tail and forward. When you get to the rib 
cage, use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone, then pull 
them from the fillet with long nose pliers. There are short but 
substantial centerline pin bones which must be pulled for the length of 
the body cavity. They are easy to find, but dive the points of your long 
nose pliers fairly deep into the flesh because the top end breaks off 
easily.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin does not have a strong, oily or off 
flavor. Skin shrink is initially strong, but not persistent. When 
pan frying fillets, you can flip them over skin side down and just hold 
them flat for a few seconds and they will stay flat. For poaching 
skin-on, I cut the fillets into two narrow ones so the curl is limited 
and I don't need the water to be too deep. After poaching, the fillet 
can be placed on the plate skin side down and it will be completely flat. 
If you desire to skin fillets, the skin is thin but tough when raw, so 
it can be easily done using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Since the skin does not 
have a strong flavor it should be added to the stock pot along with the 
heads, fins and bones to add body to the stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 3-3/8 ounce fish yielded 9-5/8 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (50%). Skin off that would be 9.1 ounces (47%). 
</p> 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones, fins and skin make an excellent 
light colored stock with a medium light flavor. It is so good it needs no 
other flavoring except a little salt. Remove the small amount of oil using 
your gravy separator. For details see our
