<h1>Sharks</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_shark01g.jpg" alt="Swimming Shark" class=mrg>
[class <i>Chondrichthyes</i> subclass <i>Elasmobranchii</i> superorder 
<i>Selachimorpha</i>]
<p>
Sharks are very different from other fish. When the modern fish (teleosts 
- bony fish) came on the scene, they rapidly pushed their predecessors 
toward extinction. Under severe stress some of these older fish back 
evolved features of their own primitive ancestors while adding some very 
advanced features as well. So successful were these adaptions the 
following era is called "The Age of Sharks" and modern fish had to 
struggle to survive.

</small>.</p>
<p>Sharks have much larger brains than modern fish and a much more complex 
social structure, not dissimilar to mammals. They are even observed to have 
play behavior, something not seen outside of mammals and birds (so we suspect 
it might have been present in other dinosaurs). Sharks generally give live 
birth instead of laying eggs and some are at least partially warm blooded 
and very energetic. They have no bones, but a skeleton of light weight 
cartilage, allowing them to grow very large and still float. They can rise 
and sink through the water column quickly, as they have no swim bladder. 
Actually sharks don't swim like fish, they fly through the water like our 
nuclear submarines, and will sink if they stop moving. Their scales are 
formed like teeth rather than the removable flakes on modern fish 
(thus shark is not kosher).</p>
<p>Many sharks are now IUCN Red Listed as VU (Vulnerable) due to slow 
birth rates and Chinese demand for shark fins. Finning sharks is illegal 
in US waters and posession of shark fins or shark fin products is now 
illegal in California, Hawaii, and New York, states with the largest 
Chinese communities.</p>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Culinary Varieties <small>of</small> Sharks</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Spiny Dogfish</h2>
<br><a href="sf_spindogz.html">

[Piked Dogfish, Mud Shark, Spurdog; Cape Shark (market); Palombo (Sicily); 
<i>Squalus acanthias</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Pacific Spiny Dogfish; 
<i>Squalus suckleyi</i>]
<p>
There are many small sharks called "Dogfish", but the Spiny Dogfish has 
always been the most common and perhaps the most common of all sharks. It 
inhabits cooler waters worldwide, except the North Pacific, where the 
very similar <i>S. suckleyi</i> replaces it. This fish can grow to a 
little over 5 feet long and 20 pounds but it is commonly a little over 3 
feet. This fish is IUCN Red Listed as VU (Vulnerable) worldwide, and CR 
(Critically Endangered) in Northern Europe, where effective controls are 
late being implemented.

<h2>Thresher Shark</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sharkthr01e.jpg" alt="Whole Thresher Shark on Beach" class=mrg>
[Common Thresher; <i>Alopias vulpinus</i> | Big Eye Thresher; 
<i>Alopias superciliosus </i> | Pelagic Thresher; 
<i>Alopias pelagicus</i>]
<p>
Common Thresher is found in temperate and tropical waters worldwide and can 
grow to nearly 25 feet and over 760 pounds. It is a warm blooded shark, thus 
very energetic, and that tail is used to herd and stun prey. Thresher is 
fished commercially and commonly sold as frozen shark steaks. There was a 
major fishery in California in the 1980s but populations 
collapsed within a decade from overfishing. Now under strict fisheries 
regulation the populations are recovering, but most thresher is now caught 
as bycatch from other fishery operations. Due to the California experience, 
all three Thresher sharks are now IUCN Red Listed as VU (vulnerable). &nbsp;

<p>Big Eye Thresher and Pelagic Thresher are tropical and subtropical 
fish and not warm blooded. The Big Eye, a night hunter, is found worldwide, 
while the Pelagic is an Indo Pacific fish absent from the Atlantic. Both 
are caught primarily as bycatch from other fishery operations.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Great White Shark</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sharkgw01e.jpg" alt="Live Great White Shark" class=mrg>
[<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>]
<p>
This is one of a very few sharks where the eating can go the wrong way. 
Great whites don't consider humans particularly edible, but in the surf 
or murky waters they can mistake a person for something tastier. They 
live in temperate and tropical waters worldwide and can grow to nearly 
26 feet and nearly 7500 pounds. This is quite large, but dwarfed by the 
extinct <i>C. megalodon</i> which grew up to 55 feet and over 121,000 
pounds (it ate mostly whales). How closely the Great White and Megalodon 
are related is currently subject to fierce scientific debate. Great 
White Sharks can be used for human consumption just like any other shark 
- their fins are in demand in China, their livers by the supplement 
industry and their hides by fashion houses. IUCN Red Listed as VU 
(vulnerable).

<h2>Blue Shark</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sharkbu01d.jpg" alt="Live Blue Shark" class=mrg>
[<i>Prionace glauca</i>]
<p>
Blue Sharks have the widest range of any animal, inhabiting all oceanic 
waters between the arctic circles. They can grow to 13 feet and 450 
pounds. This is the most widely caught shark in commercial fisheries, 
usually as bycatch in other fisheries, and a major source of shark fins. 
They are known to occasionally attack humans, probably mostly by mistake. 
IUCN Red Listed as NT (near threatened).

<h2>Tiger Shark</h2>]
<br><img src="img/sf_sharktg01d.jpg" alt="Live Tiger Shark" class=mrg>
[<i>Galeocerdo cuvier</i>
<p>
This is one of the most dangerous sharks. While a Great White may bite 
and say "Yuk!", a tiger shark is more likely to actually eat a human, 
because they eat just about anything, including things that are not 
edible. This shark inhabits warmer waters worldwide, staying pretty 
close to shore, and may even be found in river estuaries. Growing to 
nearly 25 feet and 1780 pounds, Tiger Shark is fished commercially for 
its fins, meat, hide, cartilage and liver. IUCN Red Listed as NT (near 
threatened).

<h2 id="cook" class=lrg>Prep <small>&amp;</small> Cooking</h2>

<p><img src="img/sf_sharkth02e.jpg" alt="Shark Steaks" class=mrg>
Shark does not cook at all like other fish. Modern bony fish cook so 
quickly and flake apart because they have very little of the connective 
tissue land animals have. Shark has connective tissue, distributed 
differently from land animals, but connective tissue it is. Shark stays 
firm when cooked, so firm you may need a knife to slice it. The texture 
is more like pork than like fish, and the flavor somewhere between pork 
and fish. The steaks shown in the photo are from thresher shark.

<img src="img/sf_shrkfin01h.jpg" alt="Pile of Shark Fins, Taiwan" class=mrg></a>
<h3 id="fins">Shark Fins:</h3> &nbsp;  Do not buy shark fins or order 
shark fin soup. "Finning" sharks is inhumane, very wasteful, illegal in 
US waters, and some of the sharks used are rated "threatened". Possession 
of shark fins and shark fin products is now illegal in California, Hawaii, 
Guam, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Illinois, New York, Deleware, Maryland, 
New Jersey, and Rhode Island - over howls of protest from Chinese restaurants 
that were serving Shark Fin Soup for 2011 US $80 to over $100 <u>per</u> 
<u>bowl</u>. Prices from $300 to $750 per bowl have been reported from 
Hong Kong. The sole purpose of shark fin soup is the cost, so hosts can show 
off their wealth - the shark fin contributes no flavor, just some texture, 
to the soup. For details see our <a href="sf_shrkfa.html"><b>Shark Fins - 
Real &amp; Artificial</b></a> page.

<h3>Catching:</h3> &nbsp; Shark must be bled as soon as caught. 
Commercially caught shark is generally handled correctly, but if you 
catch one yourself keep this in mind. Cut off the tail, preferably 
still alive, and when the bleeding slows cut off the head and gut the 
fish immediately. Scrape the blood works and green spleen from the under 
side of the backbone. Rinse well and keep the body from contact with 
blood. Keep the head and tail so the game warden can measure your fish. 
Shark meat that has not been properly bled will smell of urine and 
ammonia.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp;  In North America shark is most commonly sold in 
the form of steaks, about 1-1/2 inch thick. Shark spoils rapidly so use 
it right away or freeze immediately, or more likely, buy it frozen. As 
with the related skates and rays you can tell freshness by smell. If 
there's a distinct smell of ammonia it's not fresh. If there's just a 
faint trace of ammonia, a soak in milk or water acidulated with citric 
acid will clear it up, but really fresh shark is better.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Shark must be skinned. The skin is completely 
covered with tiny teeth rather than scales, and they don't scrape off. 
Some cultures use shark skin as sandpaper.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Shark is generally broiled, baked or grilled. It 
is considered less desirable for steaming, boiling or frying. Because of 
the connective tissue it contains, it can take significantly longer 
cooking time than other fish.

Being bitten by a shark can be hazardous to your health, and may result 
in disability or even death. For this reason, exposure to large live 
sharks, particularly in murky or turbulent water, should be limited to 
the extent practical. Most sharks, including Great Whites, don't much 
like the taste of people and usually bite by accident, but the tropical 
Tiger Shark is much more dangerous, as it will (and does) eat anything, 
including things that are not edible.

<p>Sharks, being top predators, tend to have a higher mercury content than 
prey fish. This is considered a danger mainly to the fetuses of pregnant 
women, though the FDA admits their recommended limits are a shot in the dark 
without substantial relevant scientific data. The only substantial data I 
know of is the Seychelles Study (<a href="sf_sharkz.html#s01">1</a>) where no effect on 
child development was found in a population that eats 10 times as much fish 
as Americans do. There may also an issue with high concentrations of the 
<b>neurotoxin BMAA</b>, found in shark fins, and which may contribute to 
Dementia.</p>

<p>Shark liver oil from cold water sharks has long been harvested for 
dietary supplements and has long been a primary source of vitamins A and 
D. It is also a source for alkylglycerols (also found in mother's milk and 
bone marrow), pristane, squalene, omega-3 fatty acids, triglycerides, 
glycerol ethers, and fatty alcohols. Studies of possible anti-cancer 
benefits are under way, but nothing conclusive so far.</p>

<p>Shark cartilage has been claimed to fight cancerous tumors by slowing 
the growth of new blood vessels needed to supply the tumor. Most studies 
on this have been informal and inconclusive. Better studies are under way 
but most have so far shown no benefit. One study reported that a liquid 
extract had a positive effect but solid forms did not.</p>
