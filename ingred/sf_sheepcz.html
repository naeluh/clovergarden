[<i>Semicossyphus pulcher </i>]
<p>
Found only from Monterey, California south to mid Baja California, this 
fish can grow to almost 36 inches and 35 pounds but the photo specimen 
was 16-1/2 inches and 2-1/2 pounds. The black coloration of the head and 
darkening tail indicates this fish was completing the transition from 
female to male (females are mostly red) which happens when a female 
reaches a length of 12 inches. This long lived slow reproducing fish is 
IUCN red listed as VU (Vulnerable) due to declining population.</p>

<p>California Sheephead flesh is very white and delicate of flavor. It's 
also very fragile when cooked, falling into small flakes if you stare at 
it too hard. Fry it with at least a powdering of rice flour, or poach in 
modest size pieces. It's completely unsuitable for soups.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is occasionally available in Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, always in its male coloration. It's probably 
not common outside of Southern California because the fishery is tightly 
regulated.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with medium size scales 
that are not very hard to scrape off - but there are a whole lot of 
them. They are very thin and stick to everything and are invisible 
until they dry and curl.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is not the easiest fish to clean because 
its internal membranes are very tough, it has a set of grinding stones 
in its throat (to crush hard shelled prey) and the gills don't pull 
easily at all. Use your kitchen shears and long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; this fish is not too difficult to fillet, 
with an easily followed bone structure - except for the ribcage, 
which is a problem. Fillet half way down the ribs, then cut them off 
with kitchen shears and pull the remaining part from the fillet with 
your long nose pliers, starting from the front of the fish. You'll be 
able to feel a row of substantial centerline pinbones for the full length 
of the body cavity. They pull hard. Use your long nose pliers and pull 
them straight forward.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; For a big headed fish, yield is reasonable. 
A 2-3/4 pound fish yielded 1-1/4 pound of skinless fillet (45%). 

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin removes quite easily using the long 
knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html">Method</a>, and it 
must be removed. It's too strong flavored for the delicate flesh and 
skin shrinkage during cooking is extreme.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, bones and fins make a good light soup 
stock with moderate oil - stronger if you use the skins. Remove the oil 
using your gravy separator.</p>
