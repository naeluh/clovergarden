<p>
These shrimp are native to the Atlantic coast of South America, from 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands.
They can grow to over 8 inches long (head-on, tip of rostrum to tip of 
tail) and the head-on photo specimens were up to 8 inches and weighed 
up to 2-1/8 ounces each. The head-off photo specimens were 
typically 4-1/2 inches long and weighed 0.66 ounces each. These shrimp 
are red because they lack the coating of gray-green protein many other 
shrimp have.</p>

<p>The flesh of these shrimp is tender, even after cooking. While most 
shrimp are firm when cooked, the flesh of these shrimp "shatters" 
into longitudinal strips. This texture can be seen in the raw state. 
In my opinion, the flavor of these shrimp is less "shrimpy" then the 
flavor of some other shrimp.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These shrimp occasionally appear in Yuppie 
oriented markets such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market. They 
also occasionally appear in the Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles. 
It's not a shrimp you can just go out and buy, it's a shrimp you 
may want to buy when you see it. The photo head-off specimens were 
bought from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (Alhambra) for 2016 
US $6.08 / pound. Two months later, the head-on specimens were 
bought at the same market for $6.99 / pound. Usually head-on is 
cheaper than head-off, so perhaps the yuppies are driving the price 
up.<p></p>

<h3>Shelling:</h3> &nbsp; These are a little more difficult to shell 
than regular White Shrimp due to thicker shells, but not by a lot.
<p></p>

<h3>De-veining:</h3> &nbsp; The gut is large and tender, but can, 
with care, be removed without breaking the skin at the top. The most 
successful method is to break the gut at the tail, then get hold of 
it at the front end and pull it out forward.
<p>De-veining the regular way is a bit harder. With many shrimp you can 
just peel off the "V" shaped strip of flesh above the gut, but not so 
easy here (until after they are cooked). The skin is tough, the flesh 
fragile, and the "V" doesn't break off naturally, so it tends to tear 
up. If the gut breaks trying to pull it out, the best strategy is to 
insert your skewer or a thin pointed knife into the front and break 
through the skin at the top far enough back that you can get hold of 
the gut again and pull it out forward.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; For head-on shrimp 15.6 ounces yielded 6-1/8 
ounces of shell-off tail meat (39%).<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Heads and shells from head-on shrimp, simmered 
slowly for about 40 minutes, make a rather good shrimp stock. Heads and 
shells from 1 pound of shrimp will make up to 4 cups of stock. It is 
rather murky, but, placed in a jar in the refrigerator, the solids will 
soon settle to the bottom, leaving an almost clear stock.<p></p>
