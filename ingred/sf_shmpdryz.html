<b>Dried Shrimp</b> are used throughout Asia, Mexico, Central and South 
America, much of Africa, and Louisiana in the United States. In most 
cases they are ground to powder or soaked and mashed to paste for use in 
recipes, but they may simply be fried whole (often in Africa) and can be 
eaten as is as a snack (Louisiana).</p>

<p>The photo shows typical examples of dried shrimp found in markets 
here in Southern California. We have included our infamous red kidney 
bean for scale.</p>

<p><b>Camaron Entero:</b> &nbsp; These large shrimp, to the right in the 
photo, are typical of dried shrimp sold in Mexican and Central and South 
American markets. They are lightly salted with good shrimp flavor. The 
photo specimens were purchased from a large multi-ethnic market in 
Los Angeles in a 1.5 ounce package for 2016 US $2.66 per ounce.</p>

<p><b>Asian Dried Shrimp:</b> &nbsp;  Top left in the photo are dried 
shrimp of the size and type most found in markets serving Korean, 
Chinese and Southeast Asian Asian communities. Much smaller ones are 
also often available. Unless otherwise stated, this is the kind of shrimp 
to use in Asian recipes. They are usually moderately salted. Soaking them 
seems to accentuate their prickliness, not soften it. The prickles go 
from powdery to firm. When used in stocks, these shrimp are usually 
strained out. I recommend running them to powder in your spice grinder 
for uses where they will not be removed.</p>

<p><b>Papery Dried Shrimp:</b> &nbsp; The Chinese name translates to 
"Shrimp Skins".  These always tiny shrimp are shown in the lower left of 
the photo, and can be found in larger Asian markets serving a Chinese 
community. They have been boiled before drying and are firm-soft with 
no prickly parts.</p>

<p><b>Tom Moi:</b> &nbsp; These tiny dried shrimp from Vietnam (bottom 
center in photo) have been beheaded, peeled, and possibly dyed before 
drying. They were dried quite firm, but not totally dry, and were not 
heavily salted, so they were sold from the frozen cases. Frozen is how 
you should store them. They have decent, though not intense, shrimp 
flavor, are lightly chewy, and have no pricklys at all - they can be 
used whole, and would probably go well with eggs. These were purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2016 US 
$6.99 / pound.</p>

<p>Dried shrimp are strong flavoring ingredients. Not so intense as 
the shrimp sauces and pastes - but you still need to use them with 
discretion.</p>

<h3>Measures:</h3> &nbsp; Dried shrimp, particularly the common 
Asian type, are a notorious measurement problem. They are bulky, nearly 
weightless, size varies widely, and the quantity needed is usually small. 
Recipes often call them out in Tablespoons, with no other information, 
but they usually don't fit in a tablespoon. The best strategy is to 
measure them coarsely crushed and lightly packed, and that's how they 
are called for on the Clovegarden site. Lightly crushed, 1 Tablespoon 
is about 3 grams or 0.10 ounce.<p></p> 

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Basically, follow the recipe - but - I strongly 
recommend a change in many recipes. Most Asian recipes call for simply 
soaking dried shrimp, or soaking and crushing. Problem: Americans, 
including myself, are not accustomed to, nor appreciative of, prickly 
things in our food. Even an hour soaking and some cooking will not 
soften those pricklys. For this reason, I strongly suggest running 
the dried shrimp to powder in your spice grinder and adding it with 
other seasonings - you get the flavor without the pricklys.<p></p>

<p>An alternative: if you really want whole shrimp in the recipe, use the 
"Papery Dried Shrimp" which are not prickly.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Look for dried shrimp that are still mostly 
intact, with some flexibility and good color - but if the color is 
unnaturally bright, they've probably been dyed in processing.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Fully dried shrimp can be stored like whole 
spices, in a sealed container away from heat and sunlight. Like spices, 
they will slowly degrade, and should be used in less than a year. An 
ammonia smell is an indication they should be discarded. Incompletely 
dried, low salt shrimp, such as the Vietnamese Tom Moi (bottom center 
in the photo), should be kept frozen.<p></p>
