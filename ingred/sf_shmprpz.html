<i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i>]
<p>
These shrimp spend their larval period in brackish water and then move 
to fresh water for the rest of their lives. They are native to the rivers 
of the Indo Pacific region, particularly from West Bengal through 
Indonesia and northern Australia. These can be found in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles, but not always. They are noted for their blue color, 
especially on their very long clawed forelimbs. Shrimp farmers break 
off the swinging side of the claws to keep them from tearing each 
other apart. These shrimp can grow to a length of 12 inches (not 
counting the long arms) and are both fished wild and farmed.
