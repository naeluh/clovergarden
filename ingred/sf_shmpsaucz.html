<span class=bg>Shrimp paste is very important to sauces and dishes 
throughout Southeast Asia and Southern China. Basically it's shrimp, 
usually very tiny shrimp, salted, fermented, and dried until it breaks 
down into a paste which may be bottled or pressed into cakes.</span>
<p></p>
<span class=bg>Much has been made of the overpowering smell and strong salty taste, but 
I haven't noticed these to be a problem, at least in high quality bottled 
products. Now the pressed block products are another matter entirely, you're 
going to want to seal them up tight in a jar.</span><p></p>

<h2>Burma</h2>
<br>
<br><h3>Pazun Ngapi</h3>, Burmese shrimp paste, is said by some sources 
to be much like the Thai, but a little softer. Other sources say it's more 
like the Malaysian. Well, Burma is northwest of Thailand and shares a long 
border, so I'd say <a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html#thain"><b>Thai- Northern</b></a> shrimp paste 
is a good bet, lacking othere evidence.<p></p>
<br>

<h2>China</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shmpchin01k.jpg" alt="Shrimp Paste" class=mrg>
<h3>Hom ha / Hay koh</h3> is used in southern coastal 
China for stir fries, with vegetables (particularly Ong Choy) and pork, 
but not a lot elsewhere in China. It is ground smooth, darker, more 
pungent, less shrimpy and saltier than most shrimp sauces but not so dark 
and salty as the Malaysian. The photo sample is Koon Chun brand, made in 
Hong Kong and widely available in Southern California.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>

<h2>Indonesia</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_shmpindo05e.jpg" alt="Roasted Blocks" class=mrg>
<h3>Terasi</h3> is made similar to <a href="sf_shmpsaucz.html#bela"><b>Belacan</b></a> (and 
may even be labeled "Belacan") but varies buy region of manufacture as to 
exact composition. Color ranges from reddish-purple to dark brown and it 
may be made of a mixture of shrimp, fish and vegetables. It is pressed 
into blocks, and as with Belacan it is roasted before use. It is also 
sometimes available as pre-roasted slices individually wrapped, as in the 
photo.
<p>The best way to roast is in a dry pan, crumbling it as it roasts. many 
recipes say to wrap it in foil and hold over a burner flame until aromatic, 
which smells up the kitchen less. Appartment dwellers sometimes resort to 
roasting it in the oven, because ovens generally vent to the outdoors. 
This product can be kept at room temperature for many months if tightly 
wrapped and kept dry. You'll want it tightly wrapped in any case to confine 
the distinctive odor. It's best kept in a tightly capped jar.

<h2>Korea</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_shmppk01e.jpg" alt="Korean Salted Shrimp" class=mrg>
<h3>Saeujeot</h3> is an important ingredient in Korean cuisine, these shrimp 
are whole and very salty but only mildly fermented so they have very much 
less flavor (and aroma) than the similar looking Malaysian Cincalok. 
Saeujeot is used as a general condiment and seasoning, sometimes in 
place of plain salt, and particularly in kimchi.

<h3>Cincalok</h3> (say chin-cha-lo) is a pinkish paste of whole tiny 
shrimp, salt and rice flour popular in Malaysia as a dipping sauce mixed 
with lime juice and shallots 
(<a href="../recipes/sjf_sambalcinc1.html"><b>Sambal Cincalok</b></a>). 
It is also used in marinades for pork, as an ingredient in omelets and 
in steamed vegetable recipes. A required ingredient for Nonya cooking in 
Singapore, it's sold in glass bottles. It has a  notably pungent aroma 
and taste, considered an acquired taste even by some Malaysians.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<br><h3>Petis Udang</h3> is a black shrimp paste with the consistency of 
molasses and made from fermented shrimp, salt, sugar and flour, similar 
to Chinese shrimp sauce. It is served as a condiment and added to soups.
<p></p>

<br><img src="img/sf_pdblachen01e.jpg" alt="Block of Belachan" class=mrg>
<h3>Blachan</h3> is the most common Malaysian shrimp paste. It is tiny shrimp 
mashed and fermented for a couple of months. It is then fried and pressed 
into cakes. It is always roasted before use in recipes. I have also found 
this product "pre-roasted", consisting of 1/4 inch thick slices from the 
block individually wrapped.

<h2>Philippines</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_pdbagoong01k.jpg" alt="2 Bagoongs" class=mrg>
<h3>Bagoong Alamang</h3> (also spelled Bagoong Aramang) is tiny shrimp or 
krill salted, fermented dried and crushed into a paste. The pink version 
is as fermented, but the color may vary because it is colored with Red 
Dye #3, sometimes more than excessively. To be honest, the bright pink 
versions dye food such a horrid unappetizing color I recommend using the 
brown fried version, or a shrimp paste from some other culture. It is 
used as an ingredient and as a table condiment.<p></p>
<h3>Bagoong Guisado / Ginisang Bagoong</h3> is the brown version. It 
is Bagoong Alamang that has been mixed with other ingredients, typically 
Oil, Vinegar, Sugar, Onion and/or Garlic, and then fried. Available in 
Regular, Sweet and Spicy versions, it is used as an ingredient and as 
a table condiment.

<h3>Thai - With Soy Oil</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kapi, Gapi]
<br><img src="img/sf_shmppt02e.jpg" alt="Blob of Kapi w/Oil" class=mrg>
<p>
<h4>Kapi</h4> is still made in fishing villages and collected by agents 
for packing companies. Basically it's just whole tiny shrimp salted and 
dried (larger shrimp will be fermented before drying). Some sources say 
this is not made from shrimp, but a similar crustacean, but there is no 
true scientific definition of "shrimp" or "prawn", so call it what you 
will. In any case it is made from genus Acetes (most) or genus 
Mesopodopsis. The packing company may add other ingredients, typically: 
soybean oil, garlic, salt, pepper, paprika oleoresin. It is often 
roasted before use - wrapping in foil and holding over a burner flame 
until aromatic works well.<p></p>
<p><u>Buying</u>: Pantainorasingh and Tra Chang are quality brands widely 
available in the US. Pantainorasingh is the brand I usually have on hand. 
The small 3.2 ounce jar is adequate for most of us. While properly made 
kapi may last for weeks at room temperature it's best to refrigerate it 
once opened, where it will keep indefinitely.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Thai - Without Soy Oil</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kapi, Gapi]
<br><img src="img/sf_shmppt04e.jpg" alt="Blob of Kapi wo/Oil" class=mrg>
<p></p>
This form of <h4>Kapi</h4> is made just as described above from genus 
Acetes (most) or genus Mesopodopsis - except, tor this type, the packing 
company does not add oil or other major ingredients. It is often roasted 
before use - wrapping in foil and holding over a burner flame until 
aromatic works well.<p></p>
<p><u>Buying</u>: This form is very uncommon compared to the form with 
oil, and I found only two brands in one of the largest Asian markets 
in Los Angeles, and none in others. The photo specimen is Nang Fah (Tue 
Kung) brand, which contains only shrimp and salt. Pantainorasingh is 
also available but has some other ingredients and is sweetened with 
saccharin. Recommended storage is "in a cool dry place", but it's best 
to refrigerate it once opened, where it will keep indefinitely. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="thain">Thai- Northern</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kapi Kung]
<br><a href="../recipes/sif_kapikung1.html">
<img src="img/sf_shmppnt02e.jpg" alt="Faked up Kapi Kung" class=mrg></a>
The Shrimp Paste of northern Thailand is not currently available in 
North America, even in Los Angeles. Andy Ricker, who is extremely fussy 
about true Thai taste, suggests faking it up from Korean salted shrimp and 
a little regular Thai Kapi (the kind without oil).  &nbsp;

<h2>Vegetarian</h2>
<br><a href="../recipes/sip_tuanao1.html">
<img src="../recipes/img/sip_tuanao18c.jpg" alt="Bowl of Tua Nao" class=mrg></a>
Probably the best solution, often called Shan Gapi (Shan Srimp Paste), is 
Shan <a href="../recipes/sip_tuanao1.html"><b>Tua Nao - Soybean Paste, 
Disks</b></a>, (Burmese), which is easy to make. You can use Thai 
Yellow Bean Sauce which is easily available and made of fermented 
soybeans and salt. Chinese 
<a href="bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black Beans</b></a> can be 
crushed to a paste and used.

<br>

<h2>Vietnam</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sf_shmpviet01k.jpg" alt="Blob of Shrimp Paste" class=mrg>
<h3>Mam Ruoc / Mam Tom</h3> is made similarly to Thai Kapi, but the 
process is a bit more complex and it ends up much darker and a more purple 
color. It's generally ground smooth and packed in jars or small tubs. 
Mam tom is the name in North Vietnam, Mam ruoc in Central and South Vietnam. 
The photo sample is made by Gia Minh in Saigon (yes I know it's Ho Chi Minh 
City now, but, like Leningrad, that will pass.
