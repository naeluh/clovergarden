<h1>Shark Fin - Real <small>&amp;</small> Artificial</h1>

Shark Fin Soup has been an essential for Chinese banquets for over 800 years. 
The reason is simple - the cost. It has been a way for the very wealthy to 
boast of their wealth. Here in California, Chinese restaurants were serving 
Shark Fin Soup for 2011 US $80 to over $100 <u>per</u> <u>bowl</u>, and in 
Hong Kong prices ranging from 2011 US $300 to $750 per bowl have been 
reported. See our 2011 article <a href="../news/110402.html">

<p>This has been very hard on the sharks, especially given the methods used 
in Asia for harvesting, just cutting off the fins and tossing the shark 
back to die. This has caused a backlash against shark fin soup in just about 
the whole world, except, of course, China.</p>

<p>Today, in California, Hawaii, Guam, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Illinois, 
New York, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island,if you get caught 
in posession of Shark Fin, or serving Shark Fin Soup, you may not be finned, 
but you certainly will be fined, and heavily. In all US fisheries, if you are 
caught with shark fins that are not attached to a shark you intend use all of, 
you are in deep trouble.</p>

<p>Consequently, artificial Shark Fin has been developed and is quite 
available. This is easy, because the shark fin provides no flavor to the 
soup, just some texture. Unfortunately, the artificial product is not at 
all acceptable for the banquet dish, because it is not outrageously 
expensive.</p>

<h3>Real Shark Fin:</h3> &nbsp; I cannot inform you where to purchase Real 
Shark Fin, because that might make me an accessory to the crime - besides, 
I don't know. Also, the seller might be an undercover agent for the 
California Fish and Game Commission - big trouble right there.

<h3>Artificial Shark Fin:</h3> &nbsp; This product may be made of Gelatin 
or Agar-agar. The Artificial Shark Fin in the photo above was sold in the 
form of a frozen slab weighing 1 pound (0.45 kg) for 2021 US $3.99. This 
is significantly less costly than Real Shark Fin, even if you don't consider 
the added cost of court fees and fines if you get caught. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel). 
Product of Taiwan. Ingred: gelatin, water, sucrose, salt, sodium 
alginate.

Most folks, including street vendors in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, 
use Bean Thread Noodles. I found one Singapore recipe recommending "Korean 
Glass Noodles", which suggested to me she could mean thin Korean Sweet Potato 
Noodles. I had those on hand (where I live has evolved into a Korea Town), 
and found them far superior to Bean Threads in size, color and flavor. They 
are shown in the photo, and are 0.060 inch (1.5 mm) in diameter. 
</p>

<p>These substitutes are not quite the right texture, as real shark fin 
is said to be both gelatinous and brittle. More accurate substitutes have 
been made experimentally, but are not considered worth the added cost. 
Today, nobody except an eco-criminal would detect the difference.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Preparation of Fresh Shark Fin is long and tedious, 
so it is usually purchased in prepared and dried form. This still needs a 
three hour soak and simmering in several changes of water to make it recipe 
ready.<p></p>

<p>Artificial Shark Fin is a lot easier. That in the photo at the top of this 
page can just be thawed and rinsed and put into the soup any time, as it is 
quite firm, and still quite firm after an hour of simmering, possibly a bit 
too firm.</p>

<p>For Bean Threads, just a soak in cool water until softened, and then 2 
minutes in the broth before serving. Korean Sweet Potato Noodles should be 
soaked somewhat longer, then added to the soup for about 8 minutes of final 
cooking.  Bean Threads are fairly durable in cooking, and Sweet Potato 
Noodles even more so, so timing is not real critical.</p>
<br>

<h2>Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>

<p>The Chinese hold that Shark Fin improves dong endurance, prevents cancer 
and heart disease, improves skin quality, provides energy, and a whole lot of 
other things. Scientific investigation has been able to confirm none of 
these, but cautions that high concentrations of <b>Neurotoxin BMAA</b> found 
in shark fin may contribute to Dementia. Also, shark, being a top predator, 
Mercury concentration is an issue, and too much Shark Fin is suspected of 
causing male sterility.</p>

<p>Artificial Shark Fin offers none of these health impacts, but it's like in 
Japan with Fugu. Fugu fish can be raised without the deadly toxins, but 
without the deadly toxins, the Japanese are uninterested. The excitement 
of the risk of death, and the extremely high cost of Fugu prepared by a 
licensed chef contribute essential elements to flavor and enjoyment.</p>
