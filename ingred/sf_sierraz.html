[Sierra, Spanish Mackerel, <i>Scomberemorus sierra</i>]
<p>
This prized eating mackerel is found along the East Central Pacific from 
Southern California to the northern tip of Chili. It can grow to 39 inches 
and 18 pounds but the photo specimen was 26 inches long and weighed 
3 pounds 1-3/4 ounces. Market size around here is between 15 and 26 
inches. This fish has rows of gold dots about 1/4 inch diameter below 
the lateral line until it descends, but they are often hard to see and 
never show up well in photos. Red List status LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p>Pacific Sierra is a prized eating fish, milder even than Atlantic 
mackerel and with excellent flavor - similar to Jacks but more delicate 
- but perhaps still a little too strong for the baby spinach set. It's 
not good for recipes like pickled mackerel that depend on oiliness and 
strong flavor, but it does make good 
<a href="../recipes/xaf_ceviche1.html">Ceviche</a>. Of course it sells 
at a higher price than other mackerels. The photo specimen was sold at 
2017 US $2.49 / pound at an Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel), 
but it can be higher, often $2.99 / pound, while other mackerels 
sell at $1.99 / pound or less in these stores.</p>

<p>This fish is mild enough to be used in recipes other than those 
specifically for mackerel. Pan fried fillets work well, skin-on or 
skin-off, with just a light dusting of rice flour or sweet potato 
starch. Of course, you fry the flesh side first, then turn i skin 
side down. It holds together well enough for wet cooking, if the 
cooking isn't too long.</p>

<p>If you poach half or quarter fillets skin-on, they will curl quite 
a bit, then relax a bit as they poach. Serve skin side down and they 
will flatten out completely. This is an excellent fish for baked stuffed 
mackerel recipes. In California sushi bars, Pacific Sierra is often 
served raw as "Spanish mackerel", but several other varieties are used 
under that same name as well - just depends on what they can get. </p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; You'll have to be a hungry rabbi with really 
good eyesight to find any scales on this fish, though it is listed as 
kosher.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems for 
cleaning, but watch out for the sharp teeth - dead fish do bite. The body 
cavity is small and there's not a lot in it, but you will have to cut the 
esophagus off with kitchen shears. You'll also want to use shears to cut 
the end of the gills loose under the chin, they pull rather hard.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is thin but fairly strong. When pan 
fried it shrinks moderately, pulling the fillet thicker, then loosens 
and blisters. By this time the fillet has taken a set and will remain 
thicker. Unlike other mackerels, the skin is fairly strong, so it's 
possible to remove it using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, and almost no flesh will be 
lost. Most mackerel recipes are skin-on, because the skin helps keep 
the tender flesh from flaking apart. The skin does not have a strong or 
"off" flavor.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is easy to fillet because it has a 
logical and easy to follow fin and bone structure. I find it easier with 
the head removed before filleting. Tilt the knife sharply under the gill 
covers to get the maximum amount of flesh. Work gently with a minimum 
of bending as the flesh is very tender. The rib cage bones rake sharply 
back and are very thin and fragile, and tend to pull out of the flesh 
as you clean the fish.</p>
<p>When you've filleted down to the backbone, work steeply over the 
backbone at the tail and forward to avoid losing flesh. When I get 
to the rib cage I just cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen 
shears and pull them from the fillet - if they haven't already 
fallen out.</p>
<p>You'll find a row of centerline pinbone bundles that need to be pulled 
for nearly one third the length of the fillet. They pull a little hard 
so hold the tender flesh in place with your fingers and pull straight 
forward with your long nose pliers. Beyond the first third you can still 
feel them but they're too soft to worry about.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 1-3/4 oz fish yielded 2 pound 7/8  
ounces of skin-on fillet (66%). That's extraordinarily high, but 
consistent even with smaller fish I've filleted. Skin off it would 
still be about 1 pound 14 ounce (61%). The thin skirt area can 
sometimes have a slight bitterness, but if you choose to cut it 
away, it is small and you won't lose much.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Unlike most mackerels, the heads fins and bones 
make an reasonably inoffensive soup stock (see 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>). It may still 
be a little "fishy" for some tastes, but fine for others. There will 
be little oil, but do carefully remove what oil there is - use your 
gravy separator.
