<p>
Found in the rivers of Southeast Asia, including Borneo and Indonesia, 
these are very tiny carp, growing to 4.7 inches long, but are commonly 
shorter. While primarily river fish, they will invade flooded rice 
fields. They are most known as an aquarium fish, but are also eaten, 
especially in Vietnam, where the fish is highly regarded.

This fish is highly regarded in Vietnam. It is usually prepared with the 
head and tail removed, briefly stewed with aromatic herbs and chilis.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The tray of frozen prepared C&aacute; L&ograve;ng 
Tong in the photograph was purchased from a large Chinese / Vietnamese 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $3.29 for 14 ounces 
($3.76 / pound). The prepared fish were typically 2-1/8 inches long.
