<h1>Icefish / Noodlefish / Silverfish</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_nfsilv02f.jpg" alt="Whole Small Silver Fish" class=mrg>
<p>[Family <i>Salangidae</i> (Icefishes, Noodlefishes) of Order 
  <i>Osmeriformes</i> (Smelts)]
</p><p>
These fish are related to trout, salmon and smelts, but remain very 
small and most species live no more than a year. They retain larval 
features, including lack of color, uncalcified bones and no scales. 
They are found in salt, brackish and fresh water along the East Asian 
coast from Korea south to Viet Nam, in Chinese rivers and lakes, and 
around Japan and the Philippines. They are generally nearly transparent 
when alive, but turn milky white upon death. They are economically 
important in China, and popular culinary fish in China, Japan and the 
Philippines.</p>

<p>There are quite a few species, but little information is available 
to me on many of them. They pretty much all look like the ones I've 
written up here, and most species are probably caught and similarly 
eaten, at least locally. I have lumped them as small, medium and large.
</p>

<h2>Chinese Icefish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_silver07h.jpg" alt="Froze Block of Chinese Silver Fish" class=mrg>
[Silver Fish;<i>Neosalanx tangkahkeii</i>  &nbsp; | &nbsp;  also  Chaohu, 
Bai Fan Yu (China); <i>Neosalanx pseudotaihuensis</i>]
<p>
These fish are native to freshwater lakes and reservoirs in eastern and 
central China and have been introduced to other regions. They are  
economically important in the regions where they are harvested. They can 
grow to 3 inches, but the largest in the photo above was 2-5/8 inches 
long. They live for one year, spawning in the spring and then dying. 
These fish are IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).</p>

<p>These fish are sold in Asian markets, usually in frozen blocks of 
random sized fish from 1/2 inch to 2-1/2 inches long - usually labeled 
"Silver Fish" or "Silverfish". They're also sold dried in tubs or bags 
labeled "Silver Anchovy", but they are not at all related to anchovies.
</p>

<p>These fish don't have a lot of flavor, but they're an interesting 
addition to thin soups. To use them, run warm water over one corner of 
the block with a mesh strainer below. Run the water until as many fish 
as you want have fallen off the block into the strainer. Wrap the block 
and put it back into the freezer compartment. Toss the fish into the 
soup just before you take it off the heat.

<p>In China, they are often mixed with eggs to make a pan fried omelet. 
Large ones are also lightly battered and deep fried for use as a topping 
for Asian salads.

<h2>Japanese Icefish</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_nfjap01d.jpg" alt="Japanese Icefish" class=mrg>
[Silver Fish; Dulong (Philippine); Shira-uo (Japan); Lapsha-ryba (Russia); 
<i>Salangichthys microdon</i>]
<p>
This fish is a bit longer than those described above (growing to 
nearly 4 inches). They are a saltwater species, so available 
around Japan and the Philippines, but also as far north as the  
Russian Far East. They enter rivers to spawn.</p>
<p>These fish can be prepared the same as Chinese Icefish or Chinese 
Noodlefish, depending on size. They are very popular in Ilocos in the 
northern Philippines, for omelets eaten for breakfast or to accompany 
beer, and are also dried. In the Philippines they are also used for a
simmered dish with various seasonings and vinegar, eaten with rice. 
In Japan, both large and small Icefish are eaten as sashimi 
(raw fish). They are kept alive so they can be served in their 
translucent state, as they turn milky white soon after death.

<h2>Chinese Noodlefish</h2>

<i>Salanx chinensis</i>]
<p>
This is a saltwater fish, but it also lives in brackish waters and enter 
fresh water to spawn. It can be found from temperate China south to 
northern Vietnam. In China, it has been stocked in some lakes and 
reservoirs with varying results. This fish can grow to 6-3/8 inches long, 
but the largest of the photo specimens was 5-3/8 inches, just about 
average for this fish. The photo specimens were purchased from an Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) frozen in an 8 ounce tray. Cost was 
2016 US $5.50 per pound. Chinese Noodlefish is IUCN Red Listed DD 
(Data Deficient).</p>
<p>In China, these fish are often lightly battered, deep fried and 
eaten with a dip. In Japan, large Icefish are eaten as sashimi 
(raw fish). They are kept alive so they can be served in their 
translucent state, as they turn milky white soon after death.
