[Order <i>Rajiformes</i>, family <i>Rajidae</i> (Skates) &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; Order <i>Myliobatiformes</i> <i>Suborder Myliobatoidei</i> 
(Stingrays)]
<p>
Skates and Rays are members of the shark family that have pectoral fins 
so exaggerated they are called "wings". This allows them to lie flat on 
the ocean floor and disappear into the sand. They eat mainly crustaceans 
and other invertebrates they find on the ocean floor, but occasionally 
take small fish. While most people in North America never encounter skate 
on their dinner plate, it is served in areas like New England that have 
a strong fishing and seafood tradition, is popular in France, and in 
the Indo-West Pacific region. The photo specimen, a whole Skate Wing, 
was 14 inches from tip to base and weighed 4.6 pounds.</p>

<h3>Skate Wing</h3> flesh is quite mild, but, like shark, has a lot of 
connective tissue in it, while bony fish have almost none. The texture 
is firm, and the flavor, again like shark, is between pork and fish. 
Unlike shark, it is in the form of a lot of narrow strips. Skate Wing 
cooks very quickly and if overcooked breaks up along the corrugations 
into separate strands.<p></p> 

<h3>Stingray Wing</h3> is the same a Skate Wing (though they evolved 
from sharks separately) but may Skates are rather small, especially 
those caught as bicatch in Southeast Asia. Small wings can be cooked 
whole, after skinning, My experience with the wing tips of Skate 
suggest it is still better to fillet them, because the cartilage 
strands become fragile and break up as you try to scrape the flesh 
off of them. Unfortunately, I can't get any of these Stingrays here 
in Southern California to experiment with.<p></p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3>  &nbsp; Skate wing is fairly common in the larger 
Asian markets here in Southern California, and may be found near fishing 
ports in other regions of North America. Skates are generally by-catch 
when fishing for other kinds of fish.

<p>Skate wing is generally sold in triangles weighting from 1 to 2 
pounds. These triangles are half a wing, so there would be four from 
a skate - but I've also found them as whole wings. The 4.6 pound photo 
specimen at the top of this page was purchased from a large Asian market 
in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2019 US $2.49 / pound.</p>

<p>The #1 key to successful skate wing cooking is for the wings to be 
very fresh. Since they're cut from the skate you don't have the usual 
methods to judge fish freshness, but smell will always tell. If it 
smells like household ammonia it is not fresh and should be 
rejected. If the smell is faint, you may be able to refresh the 
meat (see below).</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Because freshness is a big issue, you want 
to keep skate wings as cold as possible and use them as soon as possible 
- like immediately. If you must hold them, skin and fillet them and 
freeze the fillets.<p></p>

<h3>Refresh:</h3> &nbsp;  Skate wings that smell of ammonia will taste 
like ammonia. If the smell is strong, toss them out or suffer the 
consequences - it won't taste good and the dead fish odor may hang around 
for days. If you've got wings with just a hint of ammonia smell you can 
refresh them. Skin them, fillet them and prepare them ready to cook, then 
soak the pieces in strongly acidulated cold water for half an hour. 
Preferably acidulate with citric acid (1 T to 2 quarts water). Ammonia 
is alkaline and will be neutralized by the acid. The pieces of skate 
should now have a light fish smell and be much more edible.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Exact yield depends a little on how the wing was 
cut. The photo specimen was cut with a ridge of cartilage at the root, 
so one cut without that ridge would yield a little more. The photo 
specimen (photo at top of page) weighed 4.59 pounds. The main wing 
yielded 2.7 pounds 11 ounces, with another 9 ounces cut from the base 
of the wing. The yield was 71%. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Skinning</h2>

<p>Skate skin must be removed. It's basically shark skin and shark skin 
is gritty with scales that are built more like teeth than like regular 
fish scales. They don't scrape off. Male skates may also have some sharp 
spines out on the wings. There are several ways to go about this.</p>

<h3>"Easy Peel" Skates:</h3> &nbsp; Some Skate Wings are easy to skin. 
Usually, you have them cut tip to base as half wings, so you have a nice 
sharp point to start pealing from.
<ol>
<li>Lay out your wing on the cutting board, thick side up. If it is a 
  whole wing, cut it from tip to base so you have a nice sharp point at 
  the thick end. Also cut off an cartilage at the base end. The best 
  way to cut skate wing is with a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife 
  driven by a soft faced mallet.</li>
<li>Pry up a corner of the skin at the thick corner and carefully scrape 
  flesh away from the skin until the skin pulls clean without taking any 
  flesh.The skin will now pull off, but takes some strength and it's 
  slippery, so grasp it with your long nose pliers and pull right off 
  the thin edge.</li>
<li>Do the thin side the same way, if it is thick enough to use.
</ol>

<h3>Not so "Easy Peel:</h3> &nbsp; I've found, by buying some, and 
reading on-line pages, that some skates don't skin nicely and cleanly 
like the photo to the left. A thin skin pulls off, but leaves a white 
layer of connective tissue (silver skin) over the meat rather than 
pulling it off. Experienced chefs say this should be removed, but this 
layer is rather difficult to remove once the skin is pulled.<p></p>

<p>You can skin this kind of Skate wings with a fillet knife, but it 
take more skill and patience than the ones described above. </p> 
<ol>
<li>Remove the thin edges and tip - you'll have no meat from them anyway, 
  but they'll cause trouble. Make sure both leading and trailing edges 
  are cut away.</li>
<li>If a whole wing, cut it in half from tip to base. Also cut away any 
  cartilage at the root end so only fin ray ends are exposed.</li>
<li>Make a cut just under the skin at the root end.</li>
<li>Bend the skin over and start pulling it towards the point end. 
  Follow right behind, right where the skin is pulling the flesh up, 
  with a razor sharp filleting knife, leaving as little flesh on the 
  skin as you can without cutting through the skin.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Skinning the Easy Way:</h3> &nbsp; 
<ol>
<li>Set up a steamer. I use a wok with a steamer rack in it so it has 
  plenty of room.</li>
<li>I usually steam a half wing with the tip cut off so it will fit 
  in the steamer.</li>
<li>Put water in the steamer, somewhat below the rack. Bring it to 
  a full boil, checking that it doesn't overflow the rack.</li>
<li>Place the Skate Wing on the rack, thick side down. Cover, and steam. 
  <b><u>Time carefully</u>!</b> 2-1/2 minutes for a large wing, 2 
  minutes for a small one. Pull out of the steamer immediately and 
  cool on your cutting board.</li>
<li>Peel the skin off. It will pull very evenly, without breaking up 
  much unless you have over-cooked it.</li>
<li>The Skate Wing is still raw, and can now be filleted and cooked by 
  whatever method you want to use.</li>
</ol>
  
<h3>Filleting:</h3> &nbsp; Skinned by whatever method you use, you will 
now be able to filet the thick side from the cartilage layer quite 
easily, and with practically no flesh left behind. Keep your filleting 
knife at a very shallow angle to avoid cutting into the cartilage, which 
is quite soft.  <u>Note</u>: not all recipes require filleting. Skate 
may be grilled with the fin rays in, and for some recipes you flake 
the meat off the rays after poaching.

<p>Depending on the species of skate and size of your wing, the thin 
side may have enough flesh to be useful and can be filleted just like 
the thick side. In some cases, you may run out of flesh about 2/3 the 
way across so the fillet will be smaller and a lot thinner than from 
the thick side.</p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The cartilage structure and offcuts, simmered for 
a few hours (unlike regular fish stock which should be no more than 40 
minutes) makes a fairly mild stock with no oil whatever. Let it settle a 
while before decanting. This should work well blended with other fish 
stocks. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Cooking Skate Wings</h2>

<p> Most recipes for skate call for it to be pan fried, though some call 
for poaching. In either case, keep in mind that the skate filet is not 
only thin but it's deeply grooved, which allows fast heat penetration. 
Take care not to overcook, particularly when poaching, or your fillet may 
fall apart on the corrugations. The photo shows a filet pan fried without 
batter. For this dish, very popular in France, see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/fmf_skate1.html"><b>Skate Wing with Capers</b></a>.
</p>

<p>You can grill skate wings leaving the fin rays in and serve it that 
way. Use a rub or sauce suitable for grilled fish. Hearty eaters may eat 
it rays and all (depending on size), though the finicky may flake the 
meat off.</p>

<p>Note that you'll want to serve skate wings corrugated side up (the 
skin side), so you'll want to fry that side first. When you turn the 
fillet over with the cut side down it will curl some toward that side. 
This will tend to emphasize the corrugations.
