<h1>Skates <small>&amp;</small> Rays</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_skateb01d.jpg" alt="Whole Big Skate" class=mrg>
[order <i>Rajiformes</i> (skates):  family <i>Rajidae</i> (Skates) 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; Order <i>Myliobatiformes</i> (Rays)]
<p>
These mostly bottom dwelling fish are really sharks, but have pectoral 
fins so enlarged they are referred to as "wings". Like all sharks 
(<i>elasmobranks</i>), skates have no bones, but a skeleton of flexible 
cartilage.  Some skates are listed as endangered (Common Skate, Thornback 
and Roker) but it's nearly impossible to tell in the market what skate 
they are selling if it's just wings. No skate or ray is kosher.</p>

<p>Skates and Rays were formerly listed in order <i>Rajiformes</i>, but 
genetic studies have shown the Rays to have developed their winged form 
independently of the Skates, so now have their own order 
<i>Myliobatiformes</i>. For how to tell Skates from Rays see <a href=

<p>When modern bony fish first came on the scene they started eating all 
the previous type of fish, placing them under severe evolutionary 
pressure. Most perished, but some back-evolved features from the 
primitive fish they themselves had eaten, plus some features much more 
advanced than those of modern fish. These include live birth, larger 
brains, a social structure, and in some cases partial warm bloodedness. 
These adaptation were so successful the following era is called "the 
age of sharks", and modern fish had to struggle to stay relevant.</p>
<p>Skates and Rays evolved from regular sharks but dropped some of the 
more advanced features in favor of special adaptions for bottom living. 
Manta Rays and Eagle Rays later returned to a life of free swiming.</p>


<h2>Skate Wings</h2>

<img src="img/sf_skate41e.jpg" alt="Skate Wing" class=mrg></a>
Skate is generally sold as cuts from the wings and is prepared quite 
differently from other fish . I haven't seen ray for sale anywhere but 
skate wing, and sometimes whole skate can be found (erratically) in 
Asian fish markets.

<h2>Big Skate</h2>

[<i>Raja binoculata</i>]
<p>
Big Skate is found from the Bering Sea to the Mexican border, and 
is the most important commercial skate on the west coast of North 
America. It is also the largest skate found anywhere around North America, 
growing to 96 inches and 200 pounds, but the photo specimen was quite 
small at 14-1/2 inches across, 18 inches long and weighed 1.6 pounds. It 
was purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles that serves a mixed 
Chinese - Vietnamese community. This skate is IUCN Red List status NT 
(Near Threatened) but not enough is known about it to be certain one 
way or the other.

<h2>Little Skate</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_skatel01h.jpg" alt="Big Skate" class=mrg>
[<i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>]
<p>
This electric skate is found from Nova Scotia, Canada to North Carolina.  
Little Skate is used for punching fake scallops out of its wings, but the 
main commercial use for it is for baiting lobster traps. It is a small 
skate, growing only to 21 inches. Little Skate is IUCN Red 
List status NT (Near Threatened).

<h2>Rays <small>&amp;</small> Stingrays</h2>

[Order <i>Myliobatiformes</i>; Suborder <i>Myliobatoidei</i> (stingrays)]
<p>Rays are related to the sharks, but developed their winged nature 
separately from the Skates, so are not as closely related as was once 
thought. Stingrays are the most numerous and diverse of the Rays, and 
are distinct in having one or more toxic spines, about a third of the 
way out their long, whip-like tails. Rays now have their own
