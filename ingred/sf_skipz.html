<h1>Bonito / Skipjack Tuna</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_skipjack10g.jpg" alt="Whole Skipjack Tuna Fish" class=mrg>
[Katsuo (sushi); <i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>]
<p>
These small tuna can grow to over 43 inches and over 76 pounds, but 
the photo specimen was 18-1/2 inches and 3 pounds 13 ounces, about average 
in Southern California markets. Skipjack is found worldwide in tropical and 
warm-temperate seas but not in the Eastern Mediterranean or Black Sea.

<p>Commercially Skipjack is sold fresh, frozen and canned, with a small 
amount sold smoked and dried. This fish is not considered endangered. IUCN 
Red List status NE (Not Evaluated). Monterey Bay Aquarium lists pole and troll taken as 
"Best Choice", purse seine and US Longline "Good Alternative" but imported 
longline as "Avoid". Now how you're supposed to tell how a frozen bonito 
in an Asian fish market was caught, I haven't a clue.</p>

<p>Some sports fishermen say Bonito tastes like a "grilled football", and 
others say it's delicious. Clearly the difference is in how it's cooked. 
Bonito are very well regarded in regions that know how to cook fish, 
particularly Japan, Southeast Asia and Spain.</p>

<p>In all prep and cooking matters this fish is practically identical to 
the coastal Indo Pacific <a href="sf_skipiz.html">Bonito / Tongal 
Tuna</a> (<i>Euthynnus affinis</i>). The flesh is dark red, darker than 
any beef, nor does it want to be served with white wine but rather a 
substantial red. The flesh is very tender raw but becomes quite firm when 
cooked. Use where fresh tuna is called for and you don't mind it being 
dark meat, or use in place of mackerel (it's a bit milder). Commercially, 
this fish is sold canned or frozen, and sometimes dried, salted and 
smoked.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish is usually available in the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles and is quite economical, often selling for 
2010 US $1.99/pound. If Skipjack isn't available Tongal probably is.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish has a few scales, up at the head end and 
supposedly by the dorsal fin though I've only found them near the head. 
Just these few are sufficient to make the fish kosher.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This is a very messy fish to clean - there 
will be blood, dark blood, and lots of it. Far more blood than you'd ever 
expect from a fish - have plenty of cold running water to rinse it away. 
The gill arches hold pretty hard so it's convenient to cut them away at 
the ends. The innards will need to be cut off at the head end as they 
don't pull out easily. The gills are very large but soft and cut out 
fairly easily with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Skipjack is not particularly difficult to 
fillet, except for all that blood. There are bones to follow, but you'll 
need to cut around the hard surround at the dorsal and anal fins. I first 
cut off the head - slant your knife strongly under the collar to get as 
much flesh as possible. When I get to the rib cage I cut the ribs from 
the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long 
nose pliers, they rake back very sharply so need to be pulled out almost 
straight forward. There are lots of centerline pinbones that should be 
pulled, quite long at the very front but getting very short and soft as 
you work toward the tail. As you do, you'll notice prominent tendons - 
something you don't see in most fish. They can be left in.</p>

<p>Some instructions say to cut out the "blood line", the darker, 
stronger tasting flesh along the centerline - but if you do you won't 
have much fish left. If you don't like the strong flavor, use a different 
fish.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has moderate shrink and blisters off the 
flesh, so it can be left on for pan frying, where it's relatively high oil 
content and stronger flavor are an asset rather than a liability. For 
other cooking methods it should be removed. It is relatively thick at the 
tail end and becomes very thick at the head end. It does not adhere well 
over most of the fish so it's not hard to remove using the usual long 
knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. It 
is soft in the middle so the knife has to be held at as neutral an angle 
as can be managed without taking off significant flesh. Skin will remain 
on the skirt, it's thin and adheres very well there.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 13 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 15 ounces 
skin-off (51%). Counting the skirts it was 2 pounds 3/4 ounce (54%). The 
skirts are small and thin, and the lining membrane shrinks severely and 
unrelentingly, so I usually cut them off and toss them in the soup pieces 
bag in the freezer or just fry them up as a small snack.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones, after initial ugliness, 
make a surprisingly clear and very fine soup stock. Bring to a boil in an 
open pot. As it comes to a boil there will be a lot of ugly reddish brown 
scum which you should skim off. Simmer for 1/2 hour, then strain and 
separate the oil using your gravy separator.</p>

<p><b>Health and Nutrition:</b> &nbsp; There have been reports of 
ciguatera poisoning in tropical reef regions. Since it's a small tuna 
it doesn't pose a mercury hazard.</p>
