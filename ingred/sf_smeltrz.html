These smelt, native to the rivers, bays and some lakes of eastern North 
America, from Labrador, Canada south to New Jersey, are the smelt 
most eaten in North America. From a lake in Maine, they were introduced 
into the Great Lakes, and became a major commercial catch there. Their 
numbers have been rather small in recent times, though possibly starting 
to recover. This smelt, and the closely related European smelt, are noted 
for their cucumber-like smell. As with the related rainbow trout, the 
pretty colors fade rapidly upon death, and with rough handling after 
freezing (they are usually just loosely bagged) they also loose most of their tail 
fins. This fish can grow to 14 inches, but is usually around 6-1/2 
inches.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; In North America, These fish can be found 
loosely bagged even in supermarkets in the frozen food cases. The Asian 
markets in Los Angeles often have them on ice, but you can be pretty 
sure they were previously frozen (if the tail fins are broken, they have 
been frozen). They can be found "head-on" and "head-off".</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; The traditional way to prepare these fish is 
to batter them lightly and fry them lightly browned. They are then eaten 
whole, "heads guts and feathers", often with a vinegar dip. I confess I 
usually gut them because you never know what they've 
been eating these days - but I wouldn't think of removing the heads or 
tails. If you want to remove the heads and guts, see 
<a href="sf_smeltdz.html"><b>Surf Smelts</b></a> for method.</p>

<p>
The European smelt is nearly identical to the Rainbow Smelt, including 
the cucumber-like smell, and is used in the same ways. It can grow to 17 
inches, though it is commonly around 6-1/2 inches. It is native to the 
White Sea (far northwest corner of Russia), through the Baltic Sea, and 
down the Atlantic coast to as far south as Bordeaux, France. It is 
usually found in estuaries, but some populations are found in fresh 
water lakes and streams.
