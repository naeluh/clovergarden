This excellent eating fish is sold as "Mudfish" in Southern 
California's Asian fish markets, and is one of the most important food 
fish in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. It's also very popular in 
Central Asia, India and the Philippines. Both wild and farmed snakeheads 
are sold live in Asia, and will stay alive for several days in a basket 
of wet straw - but if you get caught with a live Mudfish here in 
California, it'll be you that's in very deep (legal) mud.</p>
<p>The Northern Snakehead (<i>C. argus</i>), which can stand 
cooler temperatures, now infests some parts of the United States, 
including the Potomac, Charles River, and the Mississippi Basin, 
introduced by brain dead aquarium owners, poorly educated Asians and 
careless fish farmers.</p>
<p>"Spotted Channa" is the name chosen by the Charles County, Maryland, 
Commissioners in a contest to find a more appetizing name for this fish 
for use in restaurants and fish markets. Given that, we should call the 
one in the markets here in Southern California (<i>C. striata</i>) 
"Streaky Channa", but we don't have a live fish problem here. All 
Snakeheads are voracious predators and are not in any way threatened - 
they're more on the threat side - so eat as many as you'd like, 
they're delicious!</p>
<p>Snakeheads can grow to 40 inches and 6.6 pounds but the photo specimen, 
wild caught in Vietnam, was 18-3/4 inches and 2 pound 12-5/8 ounces. It's 
a fresh water fish preferring muddy water, and like the notorious 
<a href="sf_catabz.html"><b>Walking Catfish</b></a> can survive extreme 
conditions. It can travel long distances over land to exploit new ponds 
and rivers.</p>

large page).

<p>Snakehead flesh is pink or nearly white depending on cooking method, 
with an  attractive flavor - most people should like it. Wet cooked, the 
flesh is tender, fine grained and does not flake apart, making it 
excellent for soups, stews and curries. It is also used to make 
fermented fish sauces, especially <i>Pa Daek</i> in Laos and 
<i>Nam Pla Raa</i> in Issan, Thailand where only freshwater fish are 
used. For details see our 
<a href="../recipes/sjf_tukprah1.html"><b>Tuk Prahok Sauce</b></a> 
page.</p>
<p>This fish is extremely slimy, making it rather difficult to hold on to 
until it is scaled, beheaded, cleaned and rinsed several times. Scaling, 
cleaning, filleting and skinning a whole fish will take 20 min to 25 
minutes depending on your skill level and tools.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is a popular fish in Southeast Asia, so is 
available in most Asian fish markets here in Southern California. The 
photo specimen, 18-3/4 inches long, weighing 2 pounds 12-5/8 ounces, was 
purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angles (Eagle Rock, actually) 
for 2016 US $3.99 / pound. Some of the large Asian market also have 
this fish already scalled and partially cleaned in the frozen food 
cases.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Snakehead scales are very large but not 
difficult to scrape off, with just moderate flying about.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Cleaning is a little different from most 
fish - there's lots of innards running from the head all the way to the 
tail. After making the usual incision from vent to under the jaw, make a 
cut into the body cavity on each side of the long bottom fin and pull it 
out. The innards are tough and well attached up at the head end. Use 
kitchen shears to cut them loose from the head (and immediately rinse off 
the green stuff that may spurt out). The gills are difficult to pull, you 
would need to cut them loose at the ends with kitchen shears, then pull 
them with long nose pliers. This is a waste of time as I do not recommend 
the head for stock, just cut the whole head off and toss it.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin has almost no shrink, and becomes 
quite tender when cooked. Fillets can be pan fried skin-on with no 
problems, and I recommend it that way. A skin-on fillet dropped into hot 
poaching liquid will curl only slightly. The skin has no strong or off 
flavor, but can be easily removed using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. In Asia, the skins are often 
sold separately from the fish, and are valued for making stock.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Filleting this fish is not hard, even though the 
the body cavity runs all the way from head to tail, with ribs all the 
way. At the front end they are very short, but attached to substantial 
centerline spines. Cutting in from the top you'll not find any bones to 
guide you until you're almost to the backbone.

<p>Once down to the backbone I usually just cut the ribs from the backbone 
with kitchen shears, all the way to the tail.  Up at the head 1/3, the 
ribs are very short, around 3/4 inch, but are attached to very 
substantial centerline pin bones (which go all the way out to the skin). 
I pull all these bones with long nose pliers, holding the flesh firmly to 
keep the bones from tearing it up. By time you have pulled all the pin 
bones, you'll have pulled all the ribs as well. You may still feel some 
prickliness along the centerline way out by the skin, but these bits will 
soften with cooking.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A fish 18-3/4 inches long and weighing 2 pounds 
12-5/8 ounces yielded 1 pound 8-1/4 ounces of skin-on fillet (54%) and 
1 pound 6-1/2 ounces skinless (50%). A smaller fish will yield a somewhat 
lower percentage. In some cases Snakehead is sold factory cleaned, which 
will give a yield of around 59% skin-on.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  Poaching, pan frying, roasting, baking, chunks 
in soups, stews and curries - this fish works very well for all these 
methods, and offers excellent flavor. It isn't at all oily, so it's 
probably not very good for grilling or smoking.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The skins make an excellent light stock with 
plenty of body and almost no fishy taste, explaining why the skins can 
sell at a higher price than the fish. Bones should be OK, but I do not 
recommend using heads and fins as they produce a strong flavored murky 
tan stock. See <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>.
