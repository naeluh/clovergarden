<h1>Snake Mackerel Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_snoek01g.jpg" alt="Whole Snoek Fish" class=mrg>
[family <i>Carangidae</i>]
<p>
This is a modest size family, with about 25 species, only a few of which 
are commonly eaten. The Snoek is considered favorably, especially in 
South Africa, but a couple others are quite notorious.

<h2>Snoek</h2>
<br><a href="sf_snoekz.html">
<img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_snoek01d.jpg" alt="Whole Snoek Fish" class=mrg></a>
[Zeesnoek (old Afrikaans); Barracouta (Australia); 
<i>Thyrsites atun</i>]<p>
This fish is found in the subtropical regions of the southern seas around 
the world, but only the continental shelf.  it can grow to as much as 78 inches 
and 13 pounds, but is typically 30 inches. 
When early Dutch settlers came to South Africa, they depended a lot on 
fish, as they had little access to meat animals. This fish reminded them 
of the fresh water Snoek (Snook) they knew in Holland, but this was a 
salt water fish, so they called it Zeesnoek. In South Africa, it is 
only found on the west coast. IUCN listed NE (Not Evaluated).

<img src="img/sf_escol01e.jpg" alt="Whole Escolar Fish" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Lepidocybium flavobrunneum</i>]
<p>
This fish is found on tropical and subtropical continental shelves 
worldwide.  It can grow to 78 inches and 99 pounds, but is commonly 
around 59 inches. This often mislabeled fish is outstandingly 
delicious, but is also a "problem fish" - for details see

<h2>Oilfish</h2>
<br>
<img src="img/sf_oilfish01e.jpg" alt="Whole Oilfish" class=mrg>
[Ruvettus pretiosus]<p>
This fish is found near the shores throughout the tropical and 
subtropical regions of all the world's seas.  It can grow to almost 
118 inches and 140 pounds, but is commonly around 60 inches. It is 
not fished deliberately, but shows up in by-catch. This fish has a 
pleasant rich oily taste, which has tempted stores and restaurants 
to mislabel it, which causes the same distressing problems as the 
very similar Escolar, so for details see
