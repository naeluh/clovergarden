<p>
This true Red Snapper is found from Mexico to Peru in the Eastern Pacific. 
It can get up to 37 inches long and up to almost 13 pounds but the photo 
specimen was 15-1/4 inches and weighed 1 pound 14 ounces, a bit larger 
than average market size. This snapper is a premium fish and fetches a 
premium price. Pacific Red Snapper is IUCN rated NE (Not Evaluated) but 
is not considered threatened.</p>
<p>We presume the information below is also correct for the very closely 
related Northern and Southern Red Snappers from the East Coast. Those 
are not found in fish markets here in Southern California.</p>

<p>Pacific snapper is an exceptionally well behaved and tasty fish for all 
methods of cooking and this has made it rather expensive. Most of the fish 
I buy cost between US $1.99 and $3.99 per pound at the local Philippine 
fish market, but the snapper in the photo was 2013 US $6.99 per pound. 
Is it worth the premium price? It pains my frugal** soul to say it, but 
yes, it can be, particularly for making soup - but, if it's just too 
painful, see <a href="sf_snapcdz.html">Cardinal Snapper</a> and 
<a href="sf_snapplz.html">Lane Snapper</a>.</p>

<p>The flesh is near white with a couple darker streaks just under the 
skin. It is flavorful enough for fish lovers but not so strong as to 
deeply offend those who prefer their fish white and flavorless. This fish 
is featured in our article on 
<a href="../recipes/gmf_fishbake1.html"><b>Baking Fish</b></a></p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This is a fine fish for just about any method of 
cooking: pan fried, steamed whole, baked, poached or in soup. Skinless 
fillets hold together well enough that whole fillets from fish weighing up 
to 1-1/2 pounds can be poached and served without breaking up. Fillets can 
be pan fried skin-on. Fry the non-skin side first to stiffen the fillet, 
then flip over and pat the fillet down flat with the turner. Once 
flattened it will stay flat.</p>
<p>This is <u>not</u> the fish used for Blackened Redfish. That's the 
<a href="sf_drumrz.html">Red Drum</a>, which is often not actually 
red.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are of medium size and strong, but 
scrape off rather easily with only moderate flying about. Unlike most 
fish, a fair amount of the red color is in the scales so it'll be a 
lighter red when they are scraped off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems in 
cleaning. Unless the fish is very large you can pull out the gills with 
just your fingers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a very easy fish to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. There should be almost no flesh left behind. I 
usually remove the head before filleting. Tilt the knife to get under the 
gill covers to get as much flesh as possible. There will be a couple small 
bones you'll need to cut with kitchen shears, and then the backbone. 
When filleting, minimize bending the flesh as it tends to flake apart.</p>

<p>The rib cage looks easy to follow, but when I get to it I just cut 
the ribs away from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers. They pull easily and cleanly. There is 
a row of substantial centerline spines which need to be pulled, extending 
from the front cut to the end of the body cavity.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor and shrink 
is quite moderate so steaming and baking whole fish works well, even 
without slashes through the skin for moderate sized fish.  Fillets can be 
pan fried skin-on. The skin is thin, but fairly strong, so fillets can be 
skinned easily using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. You will loose a small 
lump of flesh from the skirt, which can be used for some 
other purpose. The skins can be included with heads, bones and fins for 
making stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 14 ounce fish yielded 15-5/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (52%), and 14-1/4 ounces skinless (48%). A smaller 1 pound 
1 ounce fish yielded 8-1/2 ounces skin-on (50%) and 7-1/2 ounces skin-off 
(44%). This is a fairly good yield.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins make a very fine nearly 
clear soup stock - and you can even toss in the skins for better yield. 
There is little oil, but what there is should be removed - use your 
gravy separator. This stock is so good that to make a fine fish soup a 
shake of salt is all the ingredients you need. For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a> page.</p>

<p><b>**</b> &nbsp; <b>Frugal:</b> &nbsp; This is a polite word to use 
when what you really mean is "cheap, totally cheap, I mean really 
painfully cheap". It has replaced "a bit Scotch", which is both 
grammatically and politically incorrect.</p>
