<h1>Snapper Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_snappr05g.jpg" alt="Whole Pacific Red Snapper" class=mrg>
[family <i>Lutjanidae</i> (Snappers)]
<p>
Snappers, particularly the Pacific and Northern Red Snapper, are very 
highly regarded as food fish and demand a premium price. For this reason, 
various other fish, many not even in the Snapper family, are marketed as 
"Snapper" and even as "Red Snapper". If you buy "Red Snapper" as fillets, 
there's no telling what you're getting, and in fancy restaurants you're 
even less likely to get the real thing - "substitution" is rampant.</p>

Often marketed as "Snapper from New Zealand", this fish is not really 
a Snapper at all, but a Porgy - see 
<a href="sf_squirez.html"><b>Silver Seabream</b></a>.

[<i>Lutjanus peru</i>]
<p>
This true Red Snapper is found from Mexico to Peru in the Eastern 
Pacific. It can get up to 37 inches long and up to almost 13 pounds but 
the photo specimen was 15-1/4 inches and weighed 1 pound 14 ounces, a bit 
larger than average market size. This snapper is a premium fish and fetches 
a premium price. Pacific Red Snapper is IUCN rated NE (Not Evaluated) 
and is not considered threatened.

<img src="img/sf_snapslk02e.jpg" alt="Whole Silk Snapper 02e" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Lutjanus vivanus</i>]
<p>
This Snapper is found along the coast of the Western Atlantic, from 
North Carolina to S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, but is most common around 
the Antilles and Bahamas. It can get up to almost 33 inches long and 
18 pounds but the photo specimen was 12-3/4 inches and weighed 1 
pound 1-7/8 ounces. It looks almost identical to the Pacific Red 
Snapper but its cooking properties are a little different. There have 
been reports of <a href="seafish.html#cigu">ciguatera poisoning</a> 
from eating this fish from tropical reef environments. Silk Snapper 
is Red List rated NE (Not Evaluated) but is not considered threatened.

<h2>Northern Red Snapper</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_snapredn01e.jpg" alt="Drawing of Northern Red Snapper" class=mrg>
[<i>Lutjanus campechanus</i>]
<p>
This popular fish is found in the Gulf of Mexico and off the Western 
Atlantic coast to Massachusetts but is rare above North Carolina. It can 
grow to 39 inches and 48 pounds. There have been reports of 
<a href="seafish.html#cigu">ciguatera poisoning</a> from eating this fish  
from tropical reef environments. The body of this fish is deeper than 
the Pacific Red Snapper and the face more tapered to a point. This fish 
was badly over-fished, but the fishery is now better managed and 
populations have been recovering. We presume the culinary characteristics 
of this fish are very similar to its close relative, the Pacific Red 
Snapper, so refer to <a href="sf_snapprz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a> for that fish. &nbsp; <small>Drawing by U.S. Federal

West Atlantic from North Carolina to southern Brazil. It can grow to 24 
and nearly 8 pounds but is commonly around 10 inches. The photo specimen 
was 13 inches and weighed 14-5/8 ounces. This snapper is less well known 
than the Pacific Red Snapper so sells at a significantly lower price

fish caught in tropical reef environments. This fish.is IUCN rated NE

market it was selling at 2013 US $2.99/pound, while the better known 
"True Red Snapper" was selling at $6.99/pound. Cardinal Snapper is 
IUCN rated NE (Not Evaluated) and is not considered threatened.

[C&aacute; hong do (Viet); <i>Lutjanus erythropterus</i>]

This is what an Australian would probably have in mind as a Red Snapper. 
This species inhabits the Indo-Pacific region and is particularly 
common on the northern coast of Australia and in Indonesian waters, 
though it extends as far north as southern Japan. It is both caught 
wild  and farmed. It can grow to 32 inches long but is commonly around 
17 inches, and farmed fish will be smaller. Not considered threatened.
