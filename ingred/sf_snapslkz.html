This Snapper is found along the coast of the Western 
Atlantic, from North Carolina to S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, but is 
most common around the Antilles and Bahamas. It can get up to almost 
33 inches long and 18  pounds but the photo specimen was 12-3/4 
inches and weighed 1 pound 1-7/8 ounces. It looks almost identical 
to the Pacific Red Snapper but its cooking properties are a little 
different. There have been reports of <a href="seafish.html#cigu">
ciguatera poisoning</a> from eating this fish from tropical reef 
environments. Silk Snapper is Red List rated NE (Not Evaluated) but 
is not considered threatened.</p>

<p>Silk Snapper flesh is so tender it is unsuitable for wet cooking, 
and rather than flaking apart, it just sort of crumbles on the plate. 
The flavor is rather light and will not deeply offend people who like 
their fish "white and lite". There is a dark band down the center under 
the skin that is both wide and deep, but it doesn't taste much stronger 
than the white meat.</p>  

<p>The photo specimen was purchased from a local Philippine market 
here in Los Angeles for 2014 US $3.99 per pound. The same market usually 
asks $6.99 per pound for Pacific Red Snapper.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This fish can be pan fried with a light 
powdering of rice flour, skin on if you start them skin side up, then 
pat the fillet down flat after turning. Because the skin doesn't shrink 
strongly this fish can be baked whole. If desired the skin can be easily 
slipped off after baking. Skinless fillets are rather fragile but can be 
poached if small and carefully handled. For poaching, fillets must be 
skinned, because, though the skin shrink isn't strong, the flesh is 
extremely weak and skin shrink will roll the fillet up into a tube.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are of medium size and strong, but 
scrape off rather easily with only moderate flying about. Scrape gently 
on the belly, it is thin and liable to break open. Unlike most 
fish, a fair amount of the red color is in the scales so it'll be a 
much lighter red when they are scraped off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems in 
cleaning. The esophagus is a bit tough so you may want to cut it with 
kitchen shears. The gills pull fairly easily with long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a very easy fish to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. There should be almost no flesh left behind. I 
usually remove the head before filleting. Tilt the knife to get under the 
gill covers to get as much flesh as possible. There will be a couple small 
bones you'll need to cut with kitchen shears, and then the backbone. 
When filleting, treat it gently and minimize bending the flesh as it 
is very tender. For full method see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html">Cleaning and Filleting Round Fish</a> page.</p>

<p>When you get to the rib cage, just cut the ribs away from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long 
nose pliers. They pull easily, but hold the flesh in place with your 
fingers so it doesn't tear apart. There is a short row of substantial 
centerline spines which need to be pulled for the length of the body 
cavity. Pull straight forward, and, again, hold the flesh in place 
with your fingers or it will tear. </p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor and shrink 
is quite moderate so baking whole fish works well, even without slashes 
through the skin for moderate sized fish. The skin is thin, but fairly 
strong, so fillets can be skinned fairly easily using the long knife and 
cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but keep the 
angle of the knife quite shallow. You will loose a small lump of flesh 
from the skirt, which can be used for some other purpose. The skins can be 
included with heads, bones and fins for making stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 1-7/8 ounce fish yielded 9-1/8 ounces of 
skin-on fillet (51%), and 8-1/2 ounces skinless (48%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins make a nearly clear 
soup stock that is very mild in flavor, perhaps even too mild. you can 
toss in the skins for better yield and perhaps a little more flavor. 
There is little oil, but what there is should be removed - use your 
gravy separator. For details see our
