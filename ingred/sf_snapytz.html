[<i>Ocyurus chrysurus</i>]
<p>
This true Snapper is found from Massachusetts (rarely) through the 
Caribbean and along the nortneastern coast of South America as far 
south as northern Brazil. It can get up to nearly 34 inches long 
and 9 pounds, but is commonly around 16 inches. The photo specimen was 
16 inches and weighed 1 pound 6-3/4 ounces. This snapper is a premium 
fish and fetches a premium price. Yellowtail Snapper is not considered 
threatened, IUCN Red List rated <b>NE</b> (Not Evaluated). Some fish 
are now being farmed. There have been reports of ciguatera poisoning 
from fish caught in a tropical reef environment.</p>

<p>Yellowtail Snapper, besides its striking color, is an exceptionally 
well behaved and tasty fish for all methods of cooking, and this has 
made it rather expensive. The photo specimen was purchased at a 
Philippine market in Los Angeles for 2014 US $7.99 per pound.

Snapper</a> and <a href="sf_snapplz.html">Lane Snapper</a>.</p>

<p>The flesh is near white with a couple darker streaks just under the 
skin. It is flavorful enough for fish lovers but not so strong as to 
deeply offend those who prefer their fish white and flavorless.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This is a fine fish for just about any method of 
cooking: pan fried, steamed whole, baked, poached or in soup. Skinless 
fillets hold together well enough that whole fillets from fish weighing up 
to 1-1/2 pounds can be poached and served without breaking up. Fillets can 
be pan fried skin-on. Fry the non-skin side first to stiffen the fillet, 
then flip over and pat the fillet down flat with the turner. Once 
flattened it will stay flat. If you use it in soup, put it in for the 
last 5 to 10 minutes or it will fall apart.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are medium size with moderate 
adhesion, so they scrape off fairly easily with moderate flying about. 
Unlike most fish, a fair amount of the coloration is in the scales so 
it'll be a lighter color when they are scraped off.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems in 
cleaning. The gills pull a little hard, so use long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a very easy fish to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. There should be almost no flesh left behind. I 
usually remove the head before filleting. Tilt the knife to get under the 
gill covers to get as much flesh as possible. There will be a couple small 
bones you'll need to cut with kitchen shears, and then the backbone. 
When filleting, minimize bending the flesh as it tends to flake apart.</p>

<p>The rib cage looks easy to follow, but when I get to it I just cut 
the ribs away from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet using long nose pliers. They pull easily and cleanly. There 
is a row of substantial centerline spines which need to be pulled, 
about 7 of them, extending from the front cut to the end of the body 
cavity.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor and shrink 
is quite moderate so steaming and baking whole fish works well, even 
without slashes through the skin for moderate sized fish.  Fillets can be 
pan fried skin-on. The skin is thin, but fairly strong, so fillets can be 
skinned easily using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. You will loose a small lump 
of flesh from the skirt, which can be used for some other purpose. 
The skins can be included with heads, bones and fins for making stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1 pound 6-3/4 ounce fish yielded 12-5/8 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (55%), and 11.62 ounces skinless (52%).  This is a 
pretty good yield.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins make a very fine nearly 
clear soup stock - and you can even toss in the skins for better yield. 
There is moderate oil, which should be removed - use your gravy 
separator. This stock is so good that to make a fine fish soup a shake 
of salt is all the ingredients you need. For details see our
