[Yellow Pargo (Sports fishing); Pargo amarillo, Huachinango (Spanish); 
<i>Lutjanus argentiventris</i>]
<p>
This true Snapper is found in the Eastern Pacific, from Southern 
California (just a little above the Mexican border), south to Peru. 
It can grow to 28 inches and 28 pounds, but the photo specimen was 
18-1/2 inches and weighed 3 pound 8-3/4 ounces.  Yellow Snapper is 
IUCN Red List rated <b>LC</b> (Least Concern). Aquaculture is in 
experimental stages.</p>

<p>The flesh is off white with a darker streak for most of the length, 
The dark streak is slightly different in flavor and texture, but not 
enough to be really noticeable. The flavor of this fish is enough for fish lovers but not so strong as 
to deeply offend those who prefer their fish white and light. This fish 
does not flake easily but is easily broken up on the plate.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Yellow Snapper is not a common fish here in 
Southern California due to its restricted range, though aquaculture is 
being developed. It's a "buy it when you see it" fish. The photo specimen 
was purchased from a Philippine fish market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock, 
actually) for 2015 US $4.99 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Due to large size and skin shrink, this fish 
should be cooked as skinless fillets. Fillets hold together well enough 
that pieces up to 6 inches long can be poached and served without 
breaking up. If you use it in soup, put it in for the last 10 to 15 
minutes.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are large, hard and have good 
adhesion, so they take some effort to scrape off, and fly about quite 
a bit. Some will capsize and have to be picked off with long nose 
pliers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems in 
cleaning, but the gills pull very hard and will have to be cut away with 
kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is a very easy fish to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. There should be almost no flesh left behind, except 
in the head. I remove the head before filleting. Tilt the knife to get 
under the gill covers to get as much flesh as possible. There will be a 
couple small bones you'll need to cut with kitchen shears, and then the 
backbone.</p>

<p>The rib cage looks easy to follow, but when I get to it I just cut 
the ribs away from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet using long nose pliers. They pull a little hard, but cleanly, 
except the last one or two, which pull quite hard and take a little 
flesh. There is a row of nasty centerline spines for the length of the 
body cavity, and these need to be pulled.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor, but it 
is tough, shrinks strongly, and does not let go in during cooking. The 
skin is moderately thick, but very tough, so fillets can be skinned 
easily using the long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. The skirt is meaty and 
quite usable, but with a fillet this wide it is best to cut it off and 
skin it separately. The skirt weighs about 1-3/8 ounces from 13-3/8 ounce 
fillet (10%). The skins should be included with heads, bones and fins for 
making stock.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3 pound 8-3/4 ounce fish yielded 1 pound 10-3/4 
ounces of skin-on fillet (47%), and 1 pound 6 ounces skinless (43%). This 
is a fairly decent yield.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins and skins make a nearly 
clear, medium light and very usable soup stock. There is a fair amount of 
oil, which should be removed - use your gravy separator. For details see
