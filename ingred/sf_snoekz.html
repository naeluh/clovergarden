[Zeesnoek (old Afrikaans); Barracouta (Australia); <i>Thyrsites atun</i>]
<p>
This fish is found in the subtropical regions of the southern seas around 
the world, but only on the continental shelf.  it can grow to as much as 
78 inches and 13 pounds, but is typically 30 inches. When early Dutch 
settlers came to South Africa, they depended a lot on fish, as they had 
little access to meat animals. This fish reminded them of the fresh water 
Snoek (Snook) they knew in Holland, but this was a salt water fish, so 
they called it Zeesnoek. In South Africa it is only found on the west 
coast. IUCN listed NE (Not evaluated).

This fish is marketed in the regions where it is found, fresh, frozen, 
canned and smoked. It can be cooked by practically any method, but most 
frequently by frying, grilling or smoking. It is sometimes used for fish 
and chips, and in Japan it is used for fish cakes. It is popular with the 
Cape Malay of South Africa for many dishes. In subsistence fishing 
communities of South Africa it is commonly salted and dried, then used 
much as salt cod is used.
