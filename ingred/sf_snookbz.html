[Robalo, Black Snook 
  <i>Centropomus nigrescens</i> (west coast), Common Snook <i>C. 
  undecimalis</i> (east coast), family <i>Centropomidae</i> (Snooks)]
<p>The Common Snook, found on the eastern coast of the Americas from North 
Carolina to Brazil, grows to 4-1/2 feet and 53 pounds. Black Snook, found on 
the western coast of the Americas from southern Baja California to northern 
Columbia, grows to 4 feet and 57 pounds, but the photo specimen was 16-3/4 
inches and 1-1/4 pounds (factory cleaned). These two snooks look very similar 
except the Black is darker above the centerline.

<p>Snook has a moderate but distinct flavor. Fillets hold together well 
enough for poaching but I don't care for it cooked that way. I think the 
flavor works much better dusting lightly with rice flour and frying.</p>

<p>This fish is completely covered with smallish scales that scrape off 
easily and fly about only moderately. The gills are firmly attached and a 
bit spiny so you'll probably want to use kitchen shears to remove them.</p>

<p>Snook presents no particularly filleting problems. This is a meaty 
round fish so yield is good with a 1-1/4 pound fish yielding 11.4 ounces 
of skinless fillet (57%) - but that was from a factory gutted fish so you'll 
get a little less from one with a full set of innards.</p>

<p>The skin does not have a strong flavor 
but it does shrinks a lot when fried so should be removed using the usual 
long knife and cutting board method. Head fins and bones make a strongish 
stock which I don't much care for with a fair amount of oil.</p>
