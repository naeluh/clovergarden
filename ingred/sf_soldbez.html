[<i>Myripristis berndti</i>]
<p>
   This is an Indo-Pacific fish, ranging from the east coast of Africa 
   through the Pacific Islands, as far as the Galapagos Islands, but is 
   not found around Easter Island. It can grow up to nearly 12 inches 
   long, but is commonly around 9 inches. This fish is not considered 
   threatened, IUCN Red List rated <b>NE</b> (Not Evaluated). It is a 
   commercially exploited fish within its range</p>

<p>The pure white flesh of this fish has a good mild flavor. It holds 
together well during wet cooking, so it's good for soups and stews. It 
can only be used as skinless fillets, because skin shrink during cooking 
is extreme.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This is not at all a common fish here in 
Southern California, but it may be considered very desirable in the 
Philippines, which would explain the price. The photo specimen was 
purchased at a Philippine market in Los Angeles for 2014 US $9.99 per 
pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The scales are rather large and very stiff. They 
scrape off a little hard, but with only moderate flying about.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish presents no particular problems in 
cleaning. The gills do pull a little hard, and the esophagus is tough, 
so use long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is an easy fish to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. I usually remove the head before filleting. 
When you get to the rib cage, just cut the ribs away from the backbone 
with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet using long nose 
pliers. There are a few substantial centerline spines which need to be 
pulled, and they pull a little hard.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or "off" flavor, but 
shrink is extreme, and it does not weaken or let loose during cooking. 
Since the 
skin is so tough, fillets can be skinned rather easily using the long 
knife and cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 12-1/8 ounce fish yielded 5-3/8 ounces 
of skin-on fillet (44%), and 4-3/4 ounces skinless (39%).</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The head, bones and fins make a very usable 
soup stock (I didn't use the skins). There is quite a bit of yellow 
colored oil, which should be removed - use your gravy separator. For 
details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a>
