<h1>Sole / Common Sole</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_solea01g.jpg" alt="Whole Common Sole Fish" class=mrg>
[Common Sole, Dover Sole <i>Solea solea</i>]
<p>
"Sole" without a qualifier means Common Sole, a fish also known as 
"Dover Sole" that's very popular in Europe. Unfortunately there's another 
by that name - see <a href="sf_doverz.html"><b>Dover Sole</b></a> for 
an explanation of the confusion and subterfuge created by that name. This 
fish is native to the North Atlantic from Norway to the northwest coast of Africa, and is 
most numerous around the British Isles, the north coast of Germany and the 
coast of France. To a lesser extent it inhabits the Mediterranean and parts 
of the Black Sea. This fish can grow to 27 inches and 6.6 pounds but is 
more commonly about 12 inches.</p>
<p>In North America a number of flounders are called "Sole" to make 
them seem more sophisticated and European. While there are other true 
soles, Common Sole is most common and preferred when available. The Marine 
Stewardship Council has certified the Hastings Fleet Dover Sole fishery as 
sustainable, but that may not apply to other fisheries. This fish is now 
also being farmed.  As a Pacific Coast substitute use 
<a href="sf_petrz.html"><b>Petrale Sole</b></a> (actually a flounder). 
<b>DO NOT</b> try to use the fish sold as <a href="sf_doverz.html"><b>
Dover Sole</b></a> in western North America - its real name is Slime Fish.

<p>This fish is mild and holds together well for any method of cooking. It 
is highly thought of by chefs in Europe.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I'm sure some of the gourmet emporiums up around 
San Francisco have this fish as frozen fillets, at amazing prices - but 
I don't shop at places like that.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Most methods of cooking will work fine with this 
fish.</p>
