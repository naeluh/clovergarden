The Pacific and Atlantic spadefish are difficult to tell apart, because 
both are so variable their characteristics overlap. I believe the photo 
specimen is Pacific, but am not certain. The Eastern Pacific is found 
from San Diego, California south to Peru, while the Atlantic is found in 
the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA south through the Gulf of 
Mexico and on to the far south of Brazil. The Atlantic can grow to 
36 inches and 20 pounds, while the Pacific can grow to 26 inches. The 
photo specimen was 13 inches and weighed 1 pound 13-1/4 ounces. The 
Atlantic is a minor commercial catch and some aquaculture. The 
Atlantic is IUCN listed NE (Not Evaluated) and the Pacific LC (Least 
Concern).</p>

<p>The flesh of these fish is off-white, tender and mild, but with 
sufficient flavor to be interesting. There is a moderate amount of 
darker meat under the skin along the center. It is a little different 
in texture, but not significantly stronger in taste than the rest of 
the flesh. Fillets can take a light poaching, but not more severe wet 
cooking. I prefer it lightly dusted with rice flour, pan fried in 
a neutral oil, and eaten with my usual lemon juice, white wine and mild 
chili sauce.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish appears very rarely in the Asian 
markets here in Los Angeles, and is likely mislabeled "Angelfish". It 
is a "buy it when you see it" sort of fish. The photo specimen was 
purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angles (Eagle Rock) for 
2016 US $2.49 / pound.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with small
stiff scales with fairly good adhesion. They take a little energy 
to scrape off and fly around some.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp; While this is a deep bodied fish, it is 
built like a round bodied fish and is cleaned like one. Some stuff 
doesn't pull out easily until the gills are removed. They pull out 
fairly easily, but break up, and the aperture is small, so use 
your long nose pliers. Removing the head makes cleaning much easier, 
but If you want to cook this fish head-on, you have to do some digging. 
The head has a short bony projection at the top you need to avoid.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This fish is a little more difficult to 
fillet than many, because the fillet is so thin at the top and 
bottom, and there's a big bone at the back of the body cavity that 
gets in the way. When you cut forward to the body cavity, just cut 
the ribs from the backbone with kitchen shears. The ribs are large 
and strong, and pull hard at the top end, but most of their length 
comes out easily and clean with very little pull. There are short 
centerline pinbones for the length of the body cavity - some of which 
may have come out when the ribs were pulled.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is moderate, but soon relaxes. For 
pan frying, a skin-on fillet, when turned skin side down, can just be 
held flat for a few seconds and it will stay flat. The skin does not have 
a strong or "off" flavor, so can be left on, or removed and tossed into 
the stock pot. Fillets can be skinned using the usual long knife and 
cutting board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>, but they 
are very wide and of uneven thickness. It is best to cut the fillet 
into two right down the centerline to make skinning much easier. You 
will lose some flesh in the body cavity area because it is too tender 
to hold together without the skin.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 13 inch 1 pound 13-1/4 ounce fish yielded 13 
ounces of skin-on fillet (44%). Skin-off would be 9.6 ounces (33%). This 
low yield results from losing flesh in the body cavity area, but that 
flesh can go into the stock pot. </p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp;  The heads, fins and bones, simmered or 40 
minutes, make an almost clear stock, but with an unexpectedly green 
color. It is, however, quite usable as soup stock.</p>
