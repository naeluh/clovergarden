<p>
Spiny Eels are a separate order (<i>Synbranchiformes</i>) from eels proper 
and eels improper (<i>Anguilliformes</i>). There are a fair number 
of spiny eel species but this one, found in the rivers of Vietnam and 
Southeastern Thailand, is commercially significant (and a popular aquarium 
fish). Infesting freshwater rivers, streams, rice paddies and flooded 
forests they can grow to almost 12 inches but the photo specimen was 7.5 
inches and weighed 1.1 ounces, the largest in a tray of frozen eels from 
Vietnam. The "spiny" part is tiny sharp stickers along the back and a 
couple on bottom just in front of the fin.

<p>This fish would be a perfect candidate for dusting with rice flour, 
deep frying and eating "head, guts and feathers" - except for the spines 
which are mildly annoying. If you do go this route there's no need to clean 
them since there's almost nothing in them. On the other hand, if you're a 
little squeemish about that go ahead - nothing's lost because they split 
open during frying anyway. Only a severe sissy would cut off the heads 
though.</p>

<p>You can cut off the tips of the spines with kitchen shears before frying 
but that doesn't help much, they go deep, and the frying will crisp the 
points off anyway.</p>
