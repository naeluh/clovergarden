[Spot, Norfolk spot, Virginia spot; <i>Leiostomus xanthurus</i>]
<p>This fish is found mostly in estuarian waters close to the shore, but 
is also found in salt waters. It ins native to the coasts of the Atlantic 
and Gulf of Mexico from Massachusetts all the way down to the tip of the 
Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula.</p>

<p>This fish is very important to recreational fishing, but is no longer 
harvested commercially due to bans on gill nets along the coast. It is a 
small fish, which can grow to 14 inches, but is commonly 10 inches or 
smaller. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern).

<h3>Prep &amp; Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This is an East Coast fish, so I have 
no experience with it, but, due to its small size it is almost certainly 
scaled, cleaned, and pan fried, whole or pan dressed. Otherwise, its 
characteristics are probably similar to the larger
