<h1>Sprats</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_sprate01g.jpg" alt="Whole European Sprat" class=mrg>
[family <i>Clupeidae</i> (herring family); Genus <i>Sprattus</i>]
<p>
Sprats are small schooling fish similar to, and closely related to, 
Sardines, but a bit smaller and different enough to have their own genus 
and be called "Sprats". By far the most economically important sprat is 
the European (see below) but it is not the only one. There is also a 
a commercially fished sprat (Falkland Sprat; <i>S. fuegensis</i>) off 
the southern coast of Argentina and around the Falkland Islands. There 
is also a commercially fished Sprat off the coast of Tasmania, Australia 
(Australian Sprat; <i>S. novaehollandiae</i>). There are two all around 
the coasts of New Zealand (New Zealand Sprat; <i>S. muelleri</i> and 
New Zealand Blueback Sprat; <i>S. antipodum</i>) but these are not 
fished commercially, only in subsistence fisheries.

<h2>European Sprat</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sprate01e.jpg" alt="Whole European Sprat 01e" class=mrg>
[Brisling, Bristling, Skipper; Sprotos (Lithuania); 
<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>]
<p>
This is the most economically important Sprat. They are found in great 
quantity in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, and all around the 
British Isles and the North and Northwest coasts of France. They are 
less common along the west costs of Spain and Morocco, but are fairly 
common in the Black Sea, though that fishery has seriously declined.
This fish can grow to 6-1/4 inches long, but is commonly about 4-3/4 
inches. The photo specimen was 4-1/3 inches long. The Sprat fishery 
is particularly important to Latvia, but also Estonia, Lithuania and 
Poland.

<h2>Smoked Baltic Sprats</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_spratsk03d.jpg" alt="Baltic Sprats, Smoked" class=mrg>
[Rukytos Sprotos (Lithuania); <i>Sprattus sprattus</i>]
<p>
These Sprats are smoked, but not beheaded and canned. Each has a hole at 
the back of the head where a rod was stuck through to hang them for 
smoking. They measured from 6-1/2 to 4-1/2 inches long and weighed an 
average of 0.3 ounces each. They go very well with Beer. I just snap off the head 
and eat them right down to the tail. These were from Lithuania, 
purchased from Jon's market in Gelendale, CA, in a half pound tub at 
2019 US $6.99 / pound.	Ingred: herring, salt.

<h2>Riga Sprats / Baltic Sprats</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sprat02e.jpg" alt="European Sprats, Smoked and Canned" class=mrg>
[konservetas sprotes (Latvia); konservuoti sprotai (Lithuania); 
<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>]
<p>
This is the form in which 
most people know Sprats. They are smoked, beheaded (to fit in the can 
better) and packed in 4 inch diameter by 1 inch high cans with sunflower 
seed oil and salt. Some larger ones are put up in jars. These are enjoyed 
by persons of taste, but are definitely too strong for the baby spinach 
set. They go exceptionally well with ice cold vodka and strong Russian 
tea. Fortunately plenty are now exported to North America, particularly 
from Latvia, and I keep a good stock. They should be eaten within about 
4 years, because some of the cans eventually start to leak.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Swedish "Anchovies"</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_anchswd02e.jpg" alt="Can of Swedish 'Anchovies'" class=mrg>
These are Sprats, canned in a special 
spiced brine flavored with Cinnamon and Cloves, and called 
<i>Ansjovis</i> in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Countless attempts to 
make the famous Swedish dish 
<a href="../recipes/vaf_temptjan1.html"><b>Jansson's Temptation</b></a> 
(<i>Janssons Frestelse</i>) have been totally ruined by following 
recipes that translated "Ansjovis" to "Anchovies" without further 
discussion. These fish are also very common on the 
Swedish Sm&ouml;g&aring;sbord.
<p>Ingred: Sprats fillets, sugar, salt, vinegar, sodium benzoate and 
spices. I used to get these from the food section at IKEA, but they 
don't have them now. They are currently available on-line for about 
2018 US $5.49 plus $5.99 shipping (perishable item), but the cans are 
pink, not blue, and hold 4.4 ounces rather than the blue can's 3.5 
ounces. Fortunately, with the fall of the Soviet Empire, we don't 
have to depend on Sweden any more (see next entry).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Baltic Sprat Fillets:</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_spratlf01e.jpg" alt="Dish of Baltic Sprat Fillets" class=mrg>
These Sprats are pickled in a 
spiced brine very much like that of the Swedish "Anchovies" (see above), 
and would be perfectly suitable for Jansson's Temptation except they are 
packed in light oil rather than brine. Details for using these will be 
found on our <a href="../recipes/vaf_temptjan1.html"><b>Jansson's 
Temptation</b></a> recipe page. The photo specimens, from Lithuania, 
were purchased from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 
2018 US $4.49 for 6 ounces, packed in a flat plastic serving tray ready 
for appetizer use (Bandi brand). Ingred: Baltic Sprat Fillet 
(<i>Sprattus sorattys baltica</i>), salt, sugar, spices, sorbic acid, 
sodium benzoate, polysorbate80, rapeseed oil.

<h2>Brisling Sardines:</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sardbris02e.jpg" alt="European Sprats, Canned as Sardines" class=mrg>
This form of European Sprats is so 
named to differentiate these Sardine style Sprats from the heavily 
smoked fish widely known as "Sprats". They are, or course, a different 
genus from true "Sardines", but this confusion is for the sake of 
clarity.
<br class=cll><p></p>


<h2>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Sprats are very high in Omega 3 fatty acids, which are currently 
thought to be very beneficial for cardiovascular, mental and neural 
health. At least as high as Atlantic Salmon. They are also high in 
other minerals and vitamins.</p>
<p>Sprats, like other herrings, are high in purine content, so might be  
avoided by people with gout or high uric acid in their blood.</p>
