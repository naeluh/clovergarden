[Squirefish, Pink Snapper, New Zealand Snapper, Australian 
Snapper; <i>Pagrus auratus</i>;  invalid <i>Chrysophrys auratus</i>]
<p>
This Porgy is often sold in North America as "New Zealand Snapper" or 
"Pink Snapper", though it isn't a snapper nor closely related to them. 
It is found off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. A distinctly 
separate population is found from northern Vietnam to southern Japan. 
Farming this fish is in the development stages (2015) so some market 
fish may be farmed.</p>
<p>This fish can reach 51 inches and 44 pounds, but is 
more commonly around 16 inches. The photo specimen was 12 inches 
long and weighed 1 pound 1 ounce. This fish is IUNC listed as DD 
(Data Deficient), but is not considered threatened.  &nbsp; 
<b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; The false name "Snapper" and reddish color allows 
this fish to be sold at a premium price, but it's not a snapper. It has 
excellent flavor, but has limitations that may make it not worth so 
high a price to you.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it may be labeled, this fish is not a snapper. 
It's flavor is very good, but it's cooking characteristics are not 
the same as a real Snapper. it's flesh is mild with excellent flavor, 
but the flesh is so tender it cannot be used for many forms of cooking.
</p>

<p>Any kind of wet cooking is out of the question, the flesh will just 
fall apart. Skin shrink is sufficiently severe, and the flesh so tender, 
it must be skinned for applications like pan frying, but the skin may be 
all that's holding the fillet together.</p>

<p> This fish can be baked or steamed whole or pan dressed, but the head 
is very large so pan dressed would be better.</p> 

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is quite common in the Asian markets 
here in Southern California, usually sold as "Pink Snapper", "New Zealand 
Snapper" or "Snapper from New Zealand". The photo specimen, purchased 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, was 2016 US $7.99 / pound, and 
low yield exaggerates that high price.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with moderate 
size scales with medium adhesion. They will fly about a fair amount 
when scraping them off.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Nothing unusual here, except handle the fish 
very gently because of the tender flesh. The gills are a little 
hard to get at, so use your long nose pliers.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin shrinks strongly when cooked, so it must 
be removed from fillets or they'll curl up - but the flesh is so tender 
the skin may be all that's holding a fillet together. It does soften 
by time cooking is complete. For baking, broiling or steaming or 
grilling, make diagonal slashes through the skin every inch or so.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This is a fairly easy fish to fillet with a 
coherent, easy to follow bone structure - but, the tender flesh can 
take no abuse at all, so be very gentle. Cut down to the backbone, then 
over the backbone at the tail and forward. When you get to the rib cage, 
use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the backbone, then pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers. There are a few substantial centerline 
pin bones which must be pulled for the length of the body cavity. The 
skirt will probably pretty much fall apart, so just cut it from the fillet 
and toss it in the stock pot.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 1 ounce fish yielded just 6-3/8 oz of 
skink-on fillet (38%) because of its heavy head and bone structure. 
Skinless this was 5-7/8 ounces (35%). Low yield is to be expected in a 
fish that makes its living grinding up starfish, sea urchins and 
crustaceans.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The heads, bones, fins and skins make an 
excellent light stock suitable for soups, needing no other flavor than 
a little salt, though it is somewhat cloudy. Remove the small amount of 
oil using your gravy separator. For details see our
