<p>
Some <a href="sf_rainbz.html">Rainbow Trout</a> stay in the lakes and 
rivers and are rainbows their entire lives. Others, even from the same 
batch of eggs, are rainbows for only for only one or two years, then lose 
their rainbow coloring and head out to sea to become Steelhead. A year or 
more later they return to the river of their birth to spawn, regaining 
their rainbow color. After spawning they turn silver gray again and head 
back to sea.</p>

<p>Nobody knows why some rainbows join the Navy and others stay at home, 
but those that do go to sea grow larger, live nearly twice as long (to 11 
years) and spawn over twice as many times (to 8 times). Steelhead can 
exceed 40 inches and 50 pounds but most are nearer 24 inches and 8 to 11 
pounds. They are considered threatened by habitat destruction.</p>

<p>At sea Steelhead eat a diet similar to what salmon eat so they take on 
the same orange-red color. Fish farms are now producing ersatz steelhead 
by moving rainbows to salt water pens. These may or may not be fed dye to 
produce a salmon color. The farm raised photo specimen was 27 inches long 
and weighed 6.91 pounds factory cleaned. It's flesh was not noticeably 
dyed.</p>

<h3>Please Note:</h3> &nbsp; The information here is based on a single 
specimen of farm raised steelhead. It is not likely typical of wild 
steelhead - but your chances of getting one of those are probably remote.  
Farmed steelhead are becoming rather common.<p></p>

<p>Having bought the large and fine looking specimen shown in the photo, 
I was looking forward to an enjoyable fish dinner - but ended up eating 
corn on the cob instead. The flesh was too tender to cook by most methods 
and rather insipid in flavor as well. I did broil and eat the skin for 
breakfast and snacks the next day, but the flesh I rolled up into lumps 
and froze for use in making fish balls and patties, a use for which it 
is suitable.</p>

<p>The skin can be handled as salmon skin is in sushi bars. It is broiled 
moderately crisp, generally on an oiled foil in a toaster oven. It can be 
eaten as a snack or made up with rice and nori as salmon skin rolls are.
</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Farmed steelhead are now common in Asian fish 
markets in Southern California, always labeled "Baby Salmon". The photo 
specimen was factory cleaned, but with the gills still in.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; The photo specimen had no obvious scales.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; These fish will generally be factory cleaned, 
but with gills still in. The body cavity is rather large, so if you get 
an uncleaned fish expect to remove a lot of stuff. The gills are soft 
but large, and can be easily cut out with kitchen shears.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; This is not so easy, not only because the size 
of the fish makes it difficult to handle but also because it is very limp 
and lacks an easy to follow bone structure. The skin is also rather tough 
and difficult to cut through, but the flesh is so tender it must be 
handled with considerable care lest it come apart. I suggest removing the 
head and tail immediately to make it easier to handle.</p>

<p>When you get to the rib cage, just cut the ribs away from the backbone 
with kitchen shears and pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers. 
There are also substantial centerline pinbones to pull for the length of 
the body cavity, again with the long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is thick, strong and easy to remove by 
the usual long knife and cutting board method. You should cut off the 
thin skirt area to make the fish narrower, then skin the skirts 
separately. The skin needs to be removed for any cooking method, but 
can be used on its own (see below).</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A fish weighing 6 pounds 15 ounces factory cleaned 
yielded 3 pounds 11 ounces skin-off fillets (53%) plus 12 ounces of skin.</p>



<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head (split and gills removed), fins and 
bones made a very fine and usable soup stock.</p>
