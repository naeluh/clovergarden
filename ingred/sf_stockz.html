Stockfish is fish dried without salt. It is particularly important in 
Iceland, Portugal, Italy and Nigeria. It is dried by cold air and wind 
while hanging on racks. Some fermentation from cold tolerant bacteria 
also takes place. This can only be done in regions with the right 
climate. The most common fish used is Cod, but Haddock, Pollock and Cusk 
are also used. Without salt to hold water, stockfish is very hard and 
dry. It can take several days of soaking (water changed periodically) 
to soften it.</p>

<p>Stockfish is relatively rare today in most of the world, because it 
has been much replace by salted fish. This was made possible in the 17th 
century by the great salt pans of Aveiro, Portugal, which brought the 
price of salt down to where salting fish was economical. The critical 
climate requirements for stockfish are not so strict for salted fish. An 
indoor method for producing quality stockfish was developed in 2015 
with European Union funding.</p>

<h3>Italy:</h3> &nbsp; Italy is a major importer of stockfish from 
Norway, most of which is either whole fish or the prime parts. Recipes 
call for soaking 24 hours, then removing skin and scales before 
cooking, which will involve moderately long simmering. Norwegian 
stockfish entered Italian cuisine before 1500.<p></p>

<h3>Nigeria:</h3> &nbsp; Nigerians are major consumers of stockfish. 
It entered the country's cuisine around 1969 as famine relief donated 
by Norway, and is now considered a kitchen essential. While Nigeria 
does buy some whole fish, most of what they buy is less expensive heads, 
collars and offcuts. Since it's universal in Nigeria, nobody gives any 
instructions - except one authoritative cookbook I posess. It is put 
in a pot of water and brought to a boil, then taken off the heat and 
allowed to sit in the water overnight. Then it is deboned and made 
recipe ready. I've read they don't remove the bones because they chew 
them up for calcium, but I've found even the smallest bones to be 
unchewable.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This is not an easy product to find, except 
on the Internet. The photo specimens of "Stockfish Bits" were purchased 
from an African market in Los Angeles (North Hills) for about 2018 US 
$11.33 / pound. It was produced in Canada.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Keep dry in a very tightly sealed container. 
It should be good for at least a year.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; Depending on thickness, Stockfish will take 
at least 24 hours of soaking to be recipe ready. I put it in a heat 
sealed 2-mil polyurethane bag in the refrigerator. I refill once by 
cutting a corner off, draining and refilling, then re-seal. In the 
fridge, soaking takes longer than the Nigerian method give above.
