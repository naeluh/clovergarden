<h1>Sturgeon Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturg05i.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Sturgeon" class=mrg>
[Family <i>Acipenseridae</i> of order <i>Acipenseriformes</i>]
<p>
Sturgeon is an ancient fish, highly successful and little changed for 
something like 200 million years. The related Paddlefish is a little 
younger, having been around for only 100 million years (that we know of). 
Of the 25 living species of sturgeon, most are near to extinction due to 
the absurd prices show-offs and "gourmets" will pay for their eggs 
(caviar). This pricing encourages criminal activities, which are made 
worse by pollution and degradation of habitat. </p>
<p>Pacific White Sturgeon and Lake Sturgeon  are the only commercially 
important sturgeon not IUCN Red List "Threatened", "Endangered" or 
"Critically Endangered". The Pacific White is now heavily farmed in 
California for caviar and meat. The Lake Sturgeon are caught wild, 
mostly in Canada, though the fishery is now highly restricted.</p> 
<p>Sturgeon are the largest fish found in fresh water, with the Russian 
Beluga (<i>A. Huso huso</i>) reaching 19 feet and and over 3400 pounds, 
while the more slender Pacific White Sturgeon 
(<i>A. Acipenser transmontanus</i>) reaches 20 feet and 1800 pounds.
The specimen in the photo, smoked whole, was 27 inches long and 1.6 
pounds. Sturgeon are not kosher.</p>

<h2>Pacific White Sturgeon</h2>
<br><a href="sf_sturwz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sturg05e.jpg" alt="Live Pacific White Sturgeon" class=mrg></a>
[California White Sturgeon; <i>Acipenser transmontanus</i>]
<p>
This is the third largest sturgeon in the world, growing to 20 feet 
and 1800 pounds. While considered LC (Least Concern) in the wild, 
it is heavily farmed in California for production of caviar, with 
meat as a byproduct. Experts say the quality of California caviar 
has improved to the point it is difficult to tell it from the 
Russian.

<h2>Shovelnose Sturgeon / Hackleback</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_sturgsn01e.jpg" alt="Live Shovelnose Sturgeon" class=mrg>
<p>[Sand Sturgeon, Switchtail; <i>Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</i>]
</p><p>
This is the most abundant sturgeon in North America, found in the 
Missouri River and Mississippi River systems. While it is considered 
an excellent eating fish, it is also now valuable for production of 
caviar. It is the smallest North American sturgeon, but fast maturing.  
It can reach a maximum length of 42-1/2 inches and 10-3/4 pounds, but 
is more commonly 28 inches long. It is the only sturgeon caught 
commercially in the United States, and aquaculture is in the early 
experimental stages. The caviar is sold as "Hackleback" - apparently 
"Shovelnose" didn't sound like a good marketing name. It sells for 
around 2016 US $19.50 / ounce.  IUCN Red Listed VU (Vulnerable).

<h2>Lake Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturg09e.jpg" alt="Illustration of Lake Sturgeon" class=mrg>
[<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>]
<p>
This fish was once extremely common in the lakes and rivers along 
the US / Canada border near the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. 
Back in the days before "over regulation" about 4 million pounds 
a year were taken until around 1900 when the fishery collapsed due 
to no fish left. Today, taking this fish is highly restricted, though 
there is still a small commercial take allowed in the St Lawrence 
region of Canada. There is a restocking hatchery in Michigan serving 
mostly inland waters, but this fish is a long ways from recovering.

<h2>Atlantic / Gulf Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturg08e.jpg" alt="Illustration of Atlantic Sturgeon" class=mrg>
[Atlantic; <i>Acipenser oxyrhynchus oxyrhynchus</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Gulf; 
<i>Acipenser oxyrhynchus desotoi</i>]
<p>
This North American Sturgeon was where Europe got its caviar from 
1870 to thd beginning of the 20th century. The United States and 
Canada were not yet "over regulated" and the sturgeon were overfished, 
causing Europe to turn to the East for caviar. The Atlantic sturgeon 
ranged from New Brunswick, Canada to the east coast of Florida, but is 
now extinct in some of its range and threatened elsewhere. It is still 
sufficiently populous to be IUCN rated NT (Not Threatened). The 
essentially identical Gulf sturgeon ranges from eastern Louisiana to 
the west coast of Florida and is IUCN rated VU (Vulnerable).  These 
sturgeons can grow to 15 feet and 800 pounds. They are not currently 
harvested for caviar.</p>
<p>Efforts are under way to restock the Baltic Sea region, currently 
devoid of sturgeon, with Atlantic sturgeon. It was recently found 
that the sturgeon that formerly lived there were Atlantics, not a 
European variety.

<h2>Huso Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgeon07e.jpg" alt="Live Huso Sturgeon" class=mrg>
[Beluga; <i>Huso huso</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; Kaluga; <i>Huso dauricus</i>]
<p>
These related Sturgeons are the largest in the world, and unlike most 
others are not bottom feeders but aggressive predators of other fish. 
The Kaluga, which lives in the Amir river which separates Russia from 
China, grows to nearly 19 feet and 2200 pounds. The Beluga, inhabiting 
the Caspian and Black Sea, can grow to 24 feet and 3400 pounds. Both 
these fish are IUCN listed as CR (Critically Endangered) due to 
intensive overfishing for their high value caviar. Trade in their 
caviar is controlled mainly by Russia's murderous organized crime 
syndicates. For these reasons, Beluga and wild Kaluga should not be 
purchased or consumed. Kaluga is now being farmed in China.

<h2>Danube Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgdu01e.jpg" alt="Live Danube Sturgeon 01e" class=mrg>
[<i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i>]
<p>
This is the sturgeon from which Russian Osetra caviar is produced. 
It is native to the Black Sea, Sea of Azov and Caspian Sea, and 
enters all the rivers that drain into those seas. It has been 
severely overfished, and international trade is restricted by CITES.  
Its caviar is, however, available in North America because it is 
being farmed very successfuly in Israel. IUCN Red Listed CR 
(Critically Endangered).

<h2>Starry Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgst01e.jpg" alt="Drawing of Starry Sturgeon 01e" class=mrg>
[Sevruga; <i>Acipenser stellatus</i>]
<p>
This is the sturgeon from which Russian Sevruga caviar is produced. 
It is native to the Caspian, Black, Azov and Aegean Seas, and has 
been introduced to the Aral Sea. It enters all the rivers that drain 
into those seas. This fish can grow to 7 feet and 176 pounds, but is 
commonly 4 feet long.It has been severely overfished, and international 
trade is restricted by CITES. Its caviar is, however, available in 
North America because it is being farmed in Bulgaria, and possably 
elsewhere.  IUCN Red Listed CR (Critically Endangered).

<h2>Siberian Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgsb02e.jpg" alt="Live Siberian Sturgeon" class=mrg>
[<i>Acipenser baerii</i>]
<p>
This sturgeon is native to all the north draining rivers of Siberia. 
While it is seriously overfished in its natural habitat it has become 
of considerable interest as a farmed fish, because it tolerates the 
farm environment well. It is now used for caviar production in a number 
of countries. This fish can grow to about 79 inches and 463 pounds but 
is more commonly about 48 inches long, weighing 140 pounds.  IUCN Red 
Listed EN (Endangered) and international trade is restricted by CITES.

<h2>Sterlet</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sterlet01e.jpg" alt="Live Sterlet Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>]
<p>
This relatively small sturgeon is native to the large rivers that 
flow into the Black Sea, Asov Sea and Caspian Sea, and north flowing 
rivers in Siberia as far east as Mongolia.  It is considered 
vulnerable because of overfishing for meat, caviar and isinglass 
throughout its range, but restocking efforts are ongoing and 
significant aquaculture has been established. It is very much liked 
for food in Russia and Hungary.

<h2>Sturgeon Caviar</h2>
<br><a href="sf_eggsz.html">
<img src="img/sf_sturgeon06c.jpg" alt="Bowl of Sturgeon Caviar" class=mrg></a>
The most prestigeous (and expensive) caviar in the world is that of 
Sturgeons. Caviar is not simply harvested from the fish and sold. It 
is carefully graded, lightly salted and aged for two to three months 
under tightly controlled conditions, then carefully packed for 
shipment and sale. For details on types, grades and costs see our 
<a href="sf_eggsz.html"><b>Fish Eggs &amp; Caviar</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Smoked Sturgeon</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturg05f.jpg" alt="Smoked Whole Sturgeon" class=mrg>
As sturgeon aquaculture increases, the question comes up as to what to 
do with the male sturgeons, who take up space and eat food, but will 
never produce caviar. One solution is to turn them into products like 
smoked sturgeon. Though purchased in Los Angeles, the specimen in the 
photo to the left is not a California grown Pacific White Sturgeon (nose 
is too sharp). It may be an Atlantic sturgeon,  
(<i>A. Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus</i>)) but I'm not sure. It was 
27 inches long and 1.6 pounds, typical for whole smoked sturgeon found 
in markets serving Russian communities here.<p></p>
   
<h2>Isinglass</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_sturgis01e.jpg" alt="Swim Bladder" class=mrg>
Isinglass is a substance originally made from the swim bladder of a 
sturgeon, though some is now also made from cod. It is important for 
"fining" (making clear) certain types of beer, a process that makes 
those particular beers unsuitable for vegans (there may be traces of 
isinglass left in the beer). It is also a very important adhesive 
for restoration of ancient parchment documents and other conservation 
tasks. The photo is not a sturgeon swim bladder as no photo of one 
was available.
