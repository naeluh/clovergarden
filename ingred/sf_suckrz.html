<h1>Sucker Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_suckwt01g.jpg" alt="Live White Sucker swimming" class=mrg>
[family <i>Catostomidae</i>]
<p>
This family, related to Carp in order <i>Cypriniformes</i>, contains 
about 78 species, all except two confined to North America. They are 
small fish, most averaging about 12 inches, except the Buffalo Fish.
While several species other than the Buffalos are eaten as incidental 
catches, only a few have any commercial value or potential. They are 
most used as bait for catching the large predator fish that prey on 
suckers.

<h2>Buffalo Fish</h2>
<br>

Bigmouth Buffalo <i>Ictiobus cyprinellus</i>, Black Buffalo 
<i>Ictiobus niger</i>]
<p>
Of the three Buffalo Fish, the Smallmouth is of greatest commercial 
interest. It is already one of the most sold freshwater fish in 
North America and appears to be quite suitable for aquaculture. 
It can grow to about 40 inches and 80 pounds, but is commonly 24 
inches. A bottom feeder, it lives on a wide variety of foods including 
algae, crustaceans, mollusks and insect larvae. It is widespread 
through the Mississippi drainage basin and other river systems in 
North America, and has recently been found in California aqueducts.
</p>
<p>Buffalo Fish flesh is white and mild, but like Carp, the flesh 
of the Buffalo Fish is shot through with thread bones. While the rest 
of the world has learned to deal with these at the table, most 
North Americans have not. For this reason, the most eaten part is 
the rib cage, cut into strips parallel to the ribs and deep fried.
Personally, I always eat fish breaking it up with pointy chopsticks, 
so I can see and remove most bones easily.</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Occasionally, people have come down with 
Haff Disease, a potentially deadly poisoning, from eating Buffalo 
Fish from some areas, though it is more common from Crayfish. While 
it is a serious condition, most victims recover completely. This 
toxin is thought to come from Water Hemlock roots consumed by the 
fish.

<h2>White Sucker</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_suckwt01e.jpg" alt="White Sucker" class=mrg>
[<i>Catostomus commersonii</i> &nbsp; -also- &nbsp; Northern Hogsucker 
<i>Hypentelium nigricans</i> (smaller)]
<p>
The White Sucker is very widespread in North American rivers, from 
North Carolina to Alaska. It can grow to 25 inches and over 6 pounds, 
but is commonly 16 inches. It is a minor commercial catch and farmed 
to some extent. It (and the Hogsucker) are often caught by "Gigging" 
(spearing) at night aided by lights. Like all fish of the Carp family, 
the flesh of this fish is shot through with thread bones that most 
North Americans have not learned to deal with at the table. Fillets 
of this fish being fairly small, a common strategy is to score 
partially through the flesh at less than 1/2 inch intervals deep 
enough to cut the thread bones. These will then be exposed to hot 
oil during frying and crisped into edibility.
