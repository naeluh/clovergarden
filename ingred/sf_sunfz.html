[family <i>Osmeridae</i> several genera]
<p>
This family of freshwater fish is native to North America. Most members are 
called something else, particularly "bass" and "perch". Some species of 
Black Bass (genus <i>Micropterus</i>) have been introduced worldwide and 
are both caught wild and farmed. Japan has been attempting to erradicate 
Black Bass which have been introduced there, but so far without success.

</p><p>These famous fresh water fish, native to North America, are not 
actually bass at all but a variety of Sunfish. This fish can grow to 38 
inches and 22 pounds, but is more commonly around 16 inches. The photo 
specimen was a 13 inch Largemouth Bass weighing 1-1/2 pounds. 
Largemouth Bass is now heavily farmed and is not considered threatened, 
but it can become a pest in non-native waters.
