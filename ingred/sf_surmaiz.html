   This Spanish Mackerel is found in the Indo-West Pacific and 
   Persian Gulf. Its range extends north to the southern tip of Japan 
   and south through the Java Sea. It can grow to 30 inches but is 
   commonly 21 inches. It is distinguished by round dots about 1/4 
   inch diameter on the sides above the centerline. Red List 
   status NE (Not Evaluated).

   <p><b>Streaked Seerfish</b> (dashes instead of spots - sometimes) 
   grows up to 37 inches but has a narrower range (India to Borneo and 
   north to North Vietnam). IUCN Red Listed LC (Least Concern).</p>
   <p><b>Narrow-barred Spanish Mackerel</b> (vertical bars all along 
   the sides) grows a lot larger, to 94 inches, and has the same range 
   as the Indo-Pacific, but is less common through most of the range. 
   It is ICUN Red Listed NT (Near Threatened), and there have been 
   reports of ciguatera poisoning.</p>

<p>These Spanish Mackerel are prized eating fish in their native range, 
much milder than Atlantic mackerel and with excellent flavor. None of 
them are currently available in North America.</p>

<p>If you are on the Pacific Coast of North America, the very 
similar Spanish Mackerel, <a href="sf_sierraz.html">
<b>Pacific Sierra</b></a> is a very suitable substitute. It is similarly 
mild, easily available, and even has spots like the Surmai.</p>

<p>If you are on the East Coast of North America, the 
<a href="sf_kingaz.html"><b>Atlantic King Mackerel</b></a>, a larger 
Spanish Mackerel of similar characteristics to the Narrow Barred 
Spanish Mackerel, would be your best substitute.</p>

<p><b>Prep &amp; Cooking:</b> &nbsp; See our <a href="sf_sierraz.html"><b>
Pacific Sierra</b></a> page. This fish and the Seerfish are so similar 
that page should be valid for them.</p>
