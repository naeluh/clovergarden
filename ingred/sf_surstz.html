<p>
Surstr&ouml;mming is reputed to be the most putrid stinking substance 
consumed by mankind - note that the can in the photo was opened outdoors, 
which is where it's most often eaten. A seasonal delicacy in northern 
Sweden, it's only competitor for stinkiness is said to be Japanese 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfshdry.html#kusaya"><b>Kusaya</b></a>, Both are 
produced by fermenting fish in insufficient salt to properly preserve 
them. This, in both cases, appears to stem from ancient times when salt 
was very expensive.</p>
<p>Baltic herring are first fermented in tubs for one or two months, then 
put up in cans - but the fermentation continues in the can, causing the 
cans to swell noticeably. Surstr&ouml;mming is normally eaten on bread 
along with potatoes and chopped red onions.</p>
<p>I ordered a can of Surstr&ouml;mming from Sweden, and now have my 
own experiences (2020) published as a pictorial epic (see 
<a href="../recipes/vaf_surs1.html"><b>Surstr&ouml;mming 
Adventure</b></a>) but I have also retained the fine essay you will 
find below.</p>

<p>This product is normally eaten in the outdoors, and in the Autumn. 
Sales start in late August. The manufacturers recommend a method of 
handling the stench. They say all partakers (and anyone else who expects 
to hang around) cluster around the can as it is opened (cover with a 
cloth - the can is under high pressure). Once it is open, take a deep 
breath. This is reported to stun the olfactory senses to the point the 
stench is no longer noticed. In my experience, this doesn't work, and 
the taste is just like the smell.</p>
<p>That said, here we have a first party testimonial from Christian 
Conrad (published here by permission), now residing in Finland, who has 
had direct exposure to the product several times. These comments were 
first published on UseNet but are now on

recent comments that follow.
<blockquote>
<p>Ah well. You asked for it. Repeatedly.</p>

<p>Surstr&ouml;mming is the most noxious substance known to Mankind,
luckily known only to a small, isolated and isolationist sub-arctic 
subset of it so far, but since you ask, I'm in the process of proving 
the dangers of too well-developed communications systems. Like this 
"disinformation supertrackway" we're ab^H^Husing now.</p>

<p>You see, I strongly suspect even the <u>knowledge</u> of this wonder 
of putrefaction will form one of those "meme" brain-virus thingies in
your sub-conscious and leave you, Dear Reader, a gibbering psycho,
an empty husk of a person, twitching, slobbering, and spreading the
contagion ever onwards through your maniacal rantings.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe that wouldn't make such a big difference at all.
And since you, Malka, asked so nicely and persistently, and I'm such
a swell guy I just can't say no, prepare to be ass^H^H^Henlightened.</p>

<p>Surstr&ouml;mming is fish too, just like lutfisk. It is, or rather was
when it was alive, an ordinary str&ouml;mming, which is a kind of small
herring, too small to be a sill. I'm not sure, though, whether it is
a separate  species / variant /race, or just too young to be fully
grown. As it even has scales (and many other traits) to distinguish
it from the really much less harmful common or garden variety shrimp,
it would AFAIK be perfectly kosher. Now if there ever was a motive
of protecting the public health behind the formulation of the kashrut
rules, it must be stated openly: They've failed sadly, in this case.</p>

<p>And like lutfisk, surstr&ouml;mming gets its name from the method of
preservation and preparation (and preparation for preservation etc,
of course). In direct opposite to its caustic cousin, though, the
dreaded surstr&ouml;mming is acidic -- no, Malka, <u>not</u> "C/Hassidic"!.
Acidic as in acid, LSD, HappyHappyJoyJo -- Oops, I mean, acidic as
in acid, sourness, vinegar and lemon juice and so forth.</p>

<p>The first bit, "sur", means "sour" in Swedish. Like other sour foods,
notably sauerkraut (now <u>there</u>'s a delicacy!) it is sealed up 
airtight for a rather long while, and the microbes do their thing. Some 
of you might think that this is in effect <u>rotten</u> herring, but the 
Swedes(some of them) claim that it's not. I guess one would have to say 
they are right, <u>technically</u>. Otherwise they'd counter-claim that 
reallygood fermented stuff is bad: Sauerkraut is "rotten cabbage", beer 
is"rotten barley water", wine is "rotten grape juice", etc... </p>

<p>Surstr&ouml;mming is mainly enjoyed in the northern parts of Sweden, 
but unfortunately for me, they had a pretty generous definition of "north"
where I grew up in the middle of Sweden. It is a seasonal "delicacy",
unless the law's been changed recently. As for crayfish, which could
only be sold after the second thursday in August, this was set free
some years ago, since the market consisted mainly of frozen American and 
Turkish products anyway. (<u>Catching</u> is still restricted AFAIK.)
But I haven't heard of the official sale start for surstr&ouml;mming 
being rescinded, so for all I know it's still the third Friday in 
August.Possibly stipulated so no vendor would be tempted to put 
not-yet-ready merchandise up for sale just to beat the competition. 
The fish in question is <u>last</u> year's catch, of course. Takes 
<u>time</u> to ripen...</p>

<p>You think there seem to be a lot of excuses for partying in August? 
Yes, as the bright but oh-so-short summer comes to an end, the Swedes 
go into ever more of a party frenzy, and the atmosphere turns more or 
less orgiastic. It's probably an effect of their being at heart a rural 
people, with massive-scale urbanization having taken place only in the 
last couple of generations or so. And when they sit in their summer 
cabins, watching the verdant lushness wilt, I think they are all, men 
and women alike, acutely reminded of that biological clock that, albeit 
on a somewhat longer time-scale, is commonly associated with women only.
</p>

<p>The "correct" way to enjoy this ultimate dethronization of rotten 
eggs (commonly believed to be the most potent source of H2S. Ha! What 
a misconception!), is like most of traditional Swedish "haute cuisine":
with boiled potatoes, and no sauce. Except of course, to you Merkins,
the "sauce" could mean another liquid, which indeed <u>does</u> flow 
freely: Alcohol, clear distilled spirits, AKA schnapps (Sw. "snaps") or 
vodka.The favorite make is "skogsstjaernan", "Forest Star", a little 
flower that grows mainly in remote and peaceful parts of Swedish forests.
But you won't find that in any of the state monopoly liquor stores. It's 
a code - or nickname, it's just that in Swedish, the light of the moon 
has nothing to do with it...</p>

<p>The menu does of course have <u>some</u> items besides 
surstr&ouml;mming and potatoes. There's the thin bread of northern 
Sweden, preferably in both of its (totally taste-free) varieties, soft 
(Swedish chapatti) and crunchy (edible Plexi-glass). The potatoes should, 
for purists anyway, be of the "almond potato" kind. This is a kind of 
small and oblong potato, that actually <u>does</u> have an aroma (and 
shape) that is slightly reminiscent of almonds. The surstr&ouml;mming 
is most often eaten on bread, or even wrapped <u>in</u> it if it's the 
soft kind, with sliced potatoes, chopped red onions, and sour cream.</p>

<p>I tried to <u>eat</u> a bite once, at age 13 or so, and I just 
<u>couldn't</u>. I think my dear little mother summed it up best, at 
the same occasion:

<blockquote>  "It tastes just like shit!"</blockquote>

<p>When confronted with the logical implications of this statement
(Wouldn't <u>you</u> have, at 13?), she did of course amend it to be
"Tastes just like one would assume from the smell that shit does.",
but that just doesn't have the same ring to it, now does it?!?</p>

<p>I have actually had pieces in my mouth later, for a part of my
"initiation" at university was like apple-bobbing, only we were
supposed to catch pieces of surstr&ouml;mming out of a basin full 
of flour. The main purpose was of course to get us all silly-looking
and full of flour. Points were awarded for how many pieces you
found, and bonus points for actually swallowing them. Needless to
say, I didn't even <u>try</u> for the latter, but almost vomited 
anyway.</p>

<p>Now depending on vintage, KJ's armory could actually be about
to self-destruct. If you don't eat a can of surstr&ouml;mming the year
after it's made, it just <u>goes</u> <u>on</u> fermenting away, and 
becomes an even worse stink-bomb (inconceivable as that may seem...). 
These are normal, or perhaps even on the sturdy side of normal, tin 
cans. But mere metal cannot withstand the forces at play here. Old 
surstr&ouml;mming cans <u>swell</u>. At first, the top and bottom just
bulge slightly, but after a few years the enormous pressure that builds 
up in there forces the whole vessel into spherical shape. That is, 
blows the can up like a ball! (<u>Not</u> kidding.)</p>

<p>I have no idea where most of these cans go, unless Sweden exports
them to some country with a facility for dismantling nuclear weapons.
But some few get carelessly thrown away in the forest etc, and these
can be near-mortal traps for curious youngsters who find them.
Happened to a friend of mine when I was little. "Wow, what's this?!?
Dad, can I borrow hammer and chisel?". Being naturally cautious I
stood well back, which is how I happened to survive the resulting
explosion with only <u>mental</u> scars. <u>Not</u> something I 
recommend.</p>

<p>And now Christian's recent comments</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a footnote needs to be added: You know how people's tastes 
change, as they get older...? Yup -- I had some surstr&ouml;mming, a few 
years ago (Summer of '07, IIRC). Perhaps it was the onions and sourcream 
and potatoes and things that helped, and of course the schnapps probably 
didn't hurt either, and it certainly wasn't the greatest thing I've ever 
eaten... (and CERTAINLY not the greatest thing I've ever SMELLED!) 
But... I had me some, and it wasn't actually all that bad.</p>
