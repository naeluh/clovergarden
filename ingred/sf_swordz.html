[Xiphias gladius]
<p>
Swordfish are large, ferocious predatory fish that use their long sharp 
beak as a weapon to spear prey, which includes even Orcas, and to defend 
against Maco Sharks, the only predator big enough, fast enough and 
ferocious enough to take on a swordfish.</p>

<p>This is a worldwide fish, found in deep waters from the Arctic Circle 
to the Antarctic Circle. They grow to 14 feet and over 1000 pounds. 
Swordfish have scales, but not the kind that scrape off, so they are not 
kosher. IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern - 2011) in most regions.

Swordfish flesh is firm and holds together very well during cooking. It 
is a very large fish, so is generally cut into steaks, which are often 
grilled. <a href="sf_swordz.html#merc">Mercury content</a> is a concern and the FDA 
recommends no more than one serving per week, and 1/4 that for pregnant 
women. Because swordfish is not kosher, many restaurants serve 
<a href="sf_mahiz.html"><b>Mahi-Mahi</b></a> instead, using similar 
recipes.
