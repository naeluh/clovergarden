<h1>Threadfin Bream Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_thrdgt01g.jpg" alt="Whole Golden Thread Fish" class=mrg>
[family <i>Nemipteridae</i>]
<p>
This medium size family of tropical Indo-Pacific fish can most commonly be 
found in the West Pacific and around Malaysia, extending from the northern 
coast of Australia up to southern Japan. Some species are found instead in 
the Indian Ocean from East Africa to Malaysia, while a few species extend 
across both ranges, in whole or in part. The family gets its name from 
many species having a thread extending from the top of the tail (length 
varies). While small (up to about 13 inches), some of these fish are 
important food fish in the West Pacific region.</p>

[Golden threadfin bream; Bisugo (Philippine); Pla Sai Dang (Thai); 
<i>Nemipterus virgatus</i>]
<p>
This small West Pacific fish is commercially important in the East and 
South China Seas and is common in Asian markets in California. It is 
aso sold as <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_daingz.html"><b>Daing</b></a> (dried fish) 
in Philippine markets. While these fish can grow to a little over 13 
inches, the photo specimen, caught wild in Vietnam, was 10-1/2 inches 
long and weighing 8 ounces. The name comes from a yellow thread 
extending an inch or so from the top tip of the tail but this will 
be missing by time the fish is in the  market, due to handling while 
frozen.
