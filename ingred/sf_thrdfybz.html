   This small West Pacific fish is commercially important in the East and 
   South China Seas and is common in Asian markets in California. While 
   these fish can grow to a nearly 8 inches, the photo specimen, split, 
   salted and dried, was 7-1/4 inches long. This fish is commonly sold 
   salted and dried in the refrigerated cases of Philippine markets.</p>

<p>I have not yet studied the use of this dried fish in Philippine
