<h1>Threadfin Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_threadp01g.jpg" alt="Whole Paradise Threadfin" class=mrg>
[family <i>Polynemidae</i>]
<p>
A family of fish where several rays of the pectoral fins are detached 
and elongated, sometimes greatly elongated. These "pectoral rays" are 
thought useful for feeling out food. Threadfins are found in the Indo 
Pacific and the Atlantic, several along the east coast of the U.S.. Most 
are salt water fish but a few live in rivers and others may enter 
rivers at times.</p>

<h2>Fourfinger Threadfin</h2>

[Blue Threadfin (Aust.), Giant Threadfin, Ca Chet (Viet), 
<i>Eleutheronema tetradactylum </i>]

This Indo-West Pacific fish is common from the Persian Gulf to Papua New 
Guinea and along the north coast Australia. It enters freshwater during 
the breeding season so it's sometimes listed as a freshwater fish. It can 
grow to 6-1/2 feet but the photo specimen was 13 inches and weighed 
11 ounces. This fish is highly commercial, both wild catch and 
aquaculture, and frozen ones from Vietnam are found in Asian markets in 
Los Angeles. Packages I've purchased were labeled "Threadfin Bream" which 
they clearly are not.

[<i>Polynemus paradiseus</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish is found from Pakistan to Vietnam. It enters 
freshwater during the breeding season so it's sometimes listed as a freshwater 
fish. It can get over 10 inches long but the photo specimen was 8-1/4 inches 
and weighed 3.3 ounces. Another in the package of frozen fish from Vietnam 
was 10-1/2 inches and 7.9 ounces but was not photographed because the tail 
fins had been clipped to fit the package.
