This Indo-West Pacific fish is common from the Persian Gulf to Papua New 
Guinea and along the north coast Australia. It enters freshwater during 
the breeding season so it's sometimes listed as a freshwater fish. It can 
grow to 6-1/2 feet but the photo specimen was 13 inches and weighed 
11 ounces. This fish is highly commercial, both wild catch and 
aquaculture.</p>

<p>This is an excellent eating fish with mostly white flesh of good flavor. 
It is excellent for frying, baking and steaming, though I prefer it fried 
skin-on with a light dusting of rice flour and salt.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish can be found frozen from Vietnam in 
Asian markets in Los Angeles. Packages I've purchased were labeled 
"Threadfin Bream" which they clearly are not.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Fourfinger Threadfin is completely covered with 
small scales that scrape off easily.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There are no special problems in cleaning 
except that you may have to use long nose pliers to pull the gills from 
smaller fish.</p>

<p><b>Filleting</b> is easy, though smaller fish could be fried whole or 
pan dressed. You can shave the fillet off the rib cage with very little 
flesh left behind - when you get to the tips of the ribs just pull the 
fillet off. There will be a few centerline pinbones worth pulling, 
depending on the size of the fish.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; While the skin is easily removed using the 
standard long knife and cutting board technique, there is no reason to 
do so. Skin shrink in frying is minimal and the skin is thin with no 
strong or oily flavor. The heads,</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is good with a 13 inch 11 ounce fish 
yielding 5 ounces of fillet (54%). The fillet weight is skin-on because 
I see no reason to skin this fish.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; fins and bones make an excellent fish stock for 
soups with very little oil.</p>
