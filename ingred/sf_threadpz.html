[<i>Polynemus paradiseus</i>]
<p>
This Indo-West Pacific fish is found from Pakistan to Vietnam. It enters 
freshwater during the breeding season so it's sometimes listed as a 
freshwater fish. It can get over 10 inches long but the photo specimen 
was 8-1/4 inches and weighed 3.3 ounces. Another in the package of frozen 
fish from Vietnam was 10-1/2 inches and 7.9 ounces but was not 
photographed because the tail fins had been clipped to fit the package.

<p>This is an excellent eating fish with mostly white flesh of good 
flavor. It is excellent for frying, baking and steaming, though I prefer 
it fried skin-on with a light dusting of rice flour and salt.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Threadfins are common in the Asian fish markets 
here in Los Angeles, smaller ones in bags in the frozen food cases, 
larger ones frozen in bulk or on ice.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Paradise Threadfin is completely covered with 
small scales that scrape off easily.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp;  There are no special problems in cleaning 
except that you may have to use long nose pliers to pull the gills from 
smaller fish.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> is easy, though this small fish could be fried 
whole or pan dressed. The rib cage is no problem because it barely has 
any ribs. The fillet can just be pulled off when you get down to the 
ribs.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; While the skin is easily removed using the 
standard long knife and cutting board technique there is no reason to 
do so. Skin shrink in frying is very little and the skin is thin with 
no strong or oily flavor.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Yield is decent, with a 3.3 ounce fish yielding 
1.4 ounces (42%). The fillet weight is skin-on because I see no reason 
whatever to skin this fish.</p>
