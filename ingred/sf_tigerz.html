[<i>Unidentified</i>]
<p>At first this fish looks a lot like the common Tilapia, but you'll 
quickly notice it's comparitively thick and rather heavy. This fish was 
grown in Taiwan and purchased at an Asian market in Los Angeles labeled 
"Tiger Fish". It was 12 inches long and weighed 1-1/2 pounds.</p>

<p>The flesh of this fish is fine grained and tender. It has a slightly 
gray tint but not to the extent of making in unappetizing. It holds together 
well enough for most methods of fish cooking. Flavor is pleasant and moderate 
but distinct, so it's best for people who like fish.</p>

<p><b>Prep & Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This fish is covered with large stiff 
scales with moderate adhesion. They scrape off with moderate effort and 
don't fly around too badly. The body cavity is short so there's not a 
whole lot in it, but at the top is a large and rather tough swim bladder.
You'll need kitchen shears to cut the gills loose and there  are substantial 
grinding stones in the throat.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This fish has an easy to follow bone structure, 
excpet for the rib cage. The ribs are short but thick, sharply curved and 
very difficult to follow. When you get to the ribcage, cut it from the 
backbone with kitchen shears and deal with it on the fillet. The ribs 
cannot be pulled with pliers, and the bones go all the way out to the skin, 
so just cut that part off the fellet and cut the fleshy belly from the bottom 
of the ribs (it's quite usable). Toss the ribs into the stock pot.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is very tough and easy to remove using the 
long knife and cutting board method. It has moderate initial shrink when 
it is heated, but quickly relaxes. The skin does not have an "off" or bitter 
flavor.
.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 1.5 pound fish yielded 9-3/4 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (41%). Including the belly pieces it was 10-1/4 ounces (43%). 
Skin-off it was 8-3/4 ounces with the belly pieces (36%).</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Because the fillets are very thick at the front 
end, this is not a good candidate for pan frying. It poaches quite well 
with just enough integrity to so whole fillets can be poached without 
breaking up. </p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Heads, bones and fins make a quite serviceable fish 
stock that has a slightly tart flavor. There is a moderate amount of oil 
which you should remove using your gravy separator.</p>
