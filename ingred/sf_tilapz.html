<h1>Tilapia</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_tilap10g.jpg" alt="Whole Tilapia Fish" class=mrg>
[Sato (Tanzania); Mojara (Spanish);  Izumi-Dai (Japan); Nile Tilapia; 
<i>Oreochromis niloticus niloticus</i>]
<p>
This fish, native to the Nile, can grow to 23 inches but is generally 
marketed here at about between 10 and 13 inches and 1 to 2 pounds pounds, 
like the photo specimen. Tilapia was already being farm raised in Egypt 
probably over 4000 years ago. It has since been transported to fresh 
water rivers and lakes in many countries. Tolerant of poor water quality, 
fast growing, cheap to feed and tasty to eat, Tilapia is an ideal 
aquaculture fish for warmer climates. It is produced in quantity in 
Southern California and Arizona, but most still comes from Mexico,  
South America and Asia.</p>

<p>Tilapia flesh is mild, light in color, and contains moderate oil. 
It is firm and remains intact with just about any cooking method, 
including ceviche. It is a little delicate for soups and stews, but it 
works well enough. Most fish recipes on this site were made with Tilapia 
for their first test run, and sometimes after as well. This economical 
fish is available by the cart load, live, whole, and as frozen fillets. 
Frozen fillets are great for many uses, and I always keep some on hand.
</p>

<p>A while back Tilapia was featured in fancy restaurants - until people 
caught on they could get it inexpensively at any ethnic market. High 
priced chefs just can't live with that, so they now ridicule it every 
chance they get. I consider it a fine medium flavored multi-purpose fish 
almost everyone will like.</p>

<p>Most tilapia are grey but there are some red ones and white ones 
available at a somewhat higher price. The skin is often not eaten, 
because some say it is slightly bitter, and if not removed may discolor 
the flesh. This is not my experience, and I do see plenty of recipes 
cooking whole fish skin-on.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fish is very common both as frozen fillets 
and whole fish (usually cleaned, but not scaled). Buy whole fish only 
if you want to use parts other than fillets. With whole fish you'll 
pay the same for fillets but have to work for them.  The frozen fillets 
are very distinctive, so you will be getting real tilapia. The photo 
specimen above was purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles 
for  2014 US $1.99 / pound. Frozen fillets are as high as 2019 US $3.29 / 
pound, but are often on sale for as low as $1.99 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; Tilapia is completely covered with fairly large 
scales which scrape off easily with moderate flying about.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Despite being a rather deep bodied fish, 
Tilapia can be cleaned like a round fish because there is no bony keel. 
Just cut from the vent forward. There's a substantial swim bladder to 
break through to get to the blood works just beneath the backbone. The 
gills pull out more easily than with many fish. For details see our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and Filleting Round Fish</b></a> 
page.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Tilapia fillets fairly easily with plenty of 
fin rays and bones to follow. The rib cage has a lot of ribs. You can 
carefully follow them, shaving the fillet from the ribs. Actually, when 
I get to the rib cage I cut the ribs from the backbone with kitchen 
shears and pull them from the fillet with long nose pliers. You will 
feel what seems to be a row of substantial centerline pin bones but you 
need pull only the first three or four. The rest are soft and will not 
be noticeable when cooked.<p></p>

<p>The skirt is wide and quite thin, so the fillet will break off 
there, but it expands again at the belly where it's stiff and fatty. Cut 
these belly parts off - they are reserved for the cook. Lightly dust them 
with rice flour and frying skin-on in a lightly flavored olive oil. The 
heat causes the fat to liquify. Eat these cuts hot with some salt and 
lemon juice - fish oil is good for you (high in omega-3). This is sort 
of like with milkfish in the Philippines - the fatty belly is often sold 
separately at a higher price.</p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 5 ounce tilapia yielded 8-1/2 ounces 
of skin-on fillet including the belly fat (40%), 7-1/2 ounces skin-on 
belly trimmed (36%) and 6-3/4 ounces skinless (32%). This is pretty good 
yield for a low cost fish.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Tilapia skin shrinks very little when fried, so 
fillets can be fried skin-on. Some say the skin will make the flesh 
somewhat bitter, but I have not found that to be true. In any case, the 
skin is easy to remove using the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Tilapia head, fins and bones produce a very 
usable, moderately flavored and slightly sweet stock with moderate 
oil. I've also tossed in the skins and still had very good results - 
no bitterness or overly strong flavor. Use your gravy separator to 
remove all fat. For details see our
