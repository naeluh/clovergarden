[<i>Caulolatilus princeps</i>]
<p>
This East Pacific fish is found from Vancouver Island, Canada to 
Peru (though rare north of Central California) and can grow to over 40 
inches and over 12 pounds. The photo specimen was 17-1/2 inches and 
1-1/4 pounds but I have bought them up to 21 inches and 4-1/2 pounds. 
The FDA tilefish mercury warning does not apply to this fish, it is 
safe and an all around excellent eating fish.</p>

<p>Ocean Whitefish is an excellent eating fish with mild attractively 
flavored flesh that holds together well for dry cooking but flakes apart 
easily on the plate into large firm flakes. It can be poached, but will 
come apart with longer wet cooking. If used in soups, it should go in 
a few minutes before serving.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Ocean Whitefish is often available in Asian 
fish markets here in Los Angeles, though less commonly in the Philippine 
markets. My most recent purchase was at 2016 US $2.39 / pound at an 
Asian morket in Los Angles (San Gabriel). It is probably not common on 
the East Coast as it is a strictly Pacific fish, but the Great Northern 
Tilefish is, now sold as Golden Snapper or Golden Bass due to the 
mercury fiasco, which actually applies only to the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with smallish 
scales with medium adhesion, so they take only moderate energy to scrape 
off and don't fly around a whole lot. You may have to shave some off with 
the sharp edge of your knife.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> The Whitefish is a little more difficult than some 
fish, because the body cavity goes well aft of the vent, and there's 
stuff you need to scrape out of there (not a problem if you're going 
to fillet the fish). There's a fair amount of tough membranes you may 
wish to use your long nose pliers to pull out. Use your kitchen shears 
to cut out the gills.</p>

<p><b>Filet:</b> Ocean Whitefish is pretty easy to fillet with easy to 
follow bone structure. Start by removing the head. After cutting down to 
the backbone full length, hop over it at the tail and work forward until 
you get to the rib cage. Use kitchen sheers to cut the ribs from the 
backbone and pull them from the fillet. I cut the thin limp belly from 
the fillet and toss it in the stock pot.</p>
<p>There are substantial centerline pinbones from the front to well aft 
of the body cavity. Use your long nose pliers and pull them out straight 
forward. The problem is, they break easily and you have to dive deeply 
into the flesh to get at the strong part. They pull hard because the tips 
are anchored to the skin.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin has no strong or unpleasant flavors, 
so it can be used in the stock pot with the head, bones and fins. It 
shrinks very strongly when heated, and will curl a fillet severely if 
left on, even for frying. The skin adheres tightly, but is much stronger 
than the flesh, so it is easily removed using the long knife and cutting 
board <a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; This is a meaty fish so yield is quite good. A 
2-1/4 pound fish yielded 1-1/4 pounds of skinless fillet (56%) and a 
4-1/2 pound fish yielded 2 pounds 4-1/8 ounces (50%). 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones and skin, simmered for 
40 minutes, make an excellent cleanly flavored stock with little oil - 
but remove what there is using your gravy separator. For details see our
