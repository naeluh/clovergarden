[<i>Barbonymus altus</i> (Red Tailed Tinfoil (photo)), 
<i>B. schwanenfeldii</i> (Tinfoil Barb), <i>Poropuntius malcolmi</i> 
(Goldfin Tinfoil)]
<p>
Found in the rivers of Southeast Asia these are very small carp. The 
photo specimen (<i>B. altus</i>) is 10 inches and weighed 1 pound but most 
are smaller, while <i>B. schwanenfeldii</i> (black edges on the tail) can 
get 13 inches. The Goldfin doesn't tolerate aquaculture and is only sold 
locally in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>This is one of the most delicious fish I know. It has one problem - 
it's a carp, so you have to deal with a number of branching spines in the 
flesh. My favorite way of eating it is skin-on fillets dusted with rice 
flour and fried in olive oil but it is very good steamed or baked whole 
or as fillets.</p>

<h3>DO NOT</h3> <b>cut this fish crosswise</b> or cut scores through the 
skin for any method of cooking. The spines are quite manageable full 
length but if you cut them into pieces they are not. A fragment of spine 
embedded in your throat is not particularly dangerous but it can be 
uncomfortable.<p></p>

<h3>Scales:</h3> &nbsp; The scales are large, tough, deeply overlapping 
and have strong adhesion making it fairly difficult to scrape them off. 
You may have to pull some off with your long nose pliers.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; Cleaning is fairly easy. Though the body cavity 
is large the innards pull out easily. The gills pull loose easily enough 
but are hard to get at due to the very small gill slits. You can pull 
them out with your pliers or you can poke them back into the main cavity 
and remove them from there.<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This fish fillets easily but the skirt area is 
quite thin. I find more flesh is retained by cutting the ribcage from the 
backbone and pulling the ribs from the fillet. They're very long so pull 
them outwards rather than lengthwise as with most fish.<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Skinning this fish is a bit trickier than usual, 
but the skin shrinks very moderately and doesn't have a strong flavor so 
bits of it left on are not a problem - in fact the skin can be left on 
entirely for many recipes.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Yield is modest with a 1 pound fish yielding 6.1 
ounce of skinless fillet (38%).<p></p>
