These three fish are all but indistinguishable one from another. They 
are highly commercial Indo-West Pacific fish found from the Persian 
Gulf to the South China Sea and the Java Sea, these fish can grow to 
over 23 inches inches (14 inches for kelee) but the Hilsa specimen in 
the photo was 10 inches and weighed 6 ounces. These shad are marketed 
fresh and dried and are not considered threatened. Farming Ilish / 
Hilsa is in the development stages in India (2012 - 2014). This is 
considered a very desirable fish in West Bengal and Bangladesh, 
and is the national fish of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>As of 2 July 2014, Ilish is in very short supply in West Bengal and is  
now priced out of reach for much of the population. The fish should have 
come in with the monsoon, but have not. Some are blaming this on 
El Ni&ntilde;o.  Due to a disagreement, Bangladesh has forbidden exports, 
so frozen fish is being imported from Burma at high cost.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In India this fish is very often cut into 
steaks 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick for cooking. Many Americans are not 
accustomed to dealing with very bony fish on the plate, so you may 
wish to consider fillets instead. In Bengal the head will often be 
fried crisp and served with rice.<p></p>

<h3>Cleaning:</h3> &nbsp; This fish has the tips of the ribs fused to a 
keel bone all along the bottom, so there's no entry point. I cut off a 
little less than 1/4" with kitchen shears all along the bottom, after 
which it can be opened and cleaned as shown in 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and Filleting Fish</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h3>Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Despite their small size these fish are easy to 
fillet - there's lots of bones to follow.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 5 oz fish will be just over 4 ounces cleaned 
and will yield 2 oz of fillet (40%).<p></p>

<h3>Skin:</h3> &nbsp; The skin shrinks quite a bit when cooked but is 
easy to remove. Actually, if you make a shallow cut along the top of the 
fish in preparation for filleting it, you can pry up the corner at the 
head end and then just peel the skin off the fish. Don't worry about the 
silver color left, it's not a problem.<p></p>

<h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Herring heads and bones make a stock that still 
tastes strong and oily even after you've removed the substantial amount 
of oil. Not recommended.<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; Particularly in eastern North America, there are 
Shad available that are similar in taste and characteristics to Hilsa 
shad. The large American Shad can be used but is more closely related 
to European shad.<p></p>
