<h1>Tonguesole</h1>

[<i>Cynoglossus bilineatus</i> (Fourlined tonguesole); 
  <i>Cynoglossus arel</i> (Largescale tonguefish); and Others]
<p>
These Indo-Pacific fish are not actually sole, but Tonguefish (family 
<i>Cynoglossidae</i>). There is a very similar looking fish from the 
same Indo-Pacific region, (<i>Synaptura commersonnii</i>), also sometimes 
called "tongue sole" that is actually a sole (family <i>Soleidae</i>). 
That one can be recognized by having an actual tail (though tiny) and 
eyes very close to the front.</p>

<p>Tonguesole can grow to around 16 inches are more commonly around 
12 inches.The photo specimens were very like <i>C. bilineatus</i>, but I'm not 
completely confident that's what it is. The upper specimen was 14-1/2 inches 
long, 4-1/2 inches wide, 7/8 inch thick and weighed 10 ounces.</p>

<p>The flesh of this fish is white and light in flavor, but still 
satisfying. It is very delicate so needs to be handled carefully. The 
main problems with this fish are its small size, and as with all other 
fish of this flat form, the fin rays along the edges just about all the 
way around.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; The flesh of this fish is quite delicate, but 
with a light dusting of rice flour fillets can be pan fried successfully. 
Poached, fillets will curl a bit in a spiral manner. 5 minutes poaching 
is more than enough. Fillets can be used in recipes that do not disturb 
them, such as in casseroles, but not in soups where they will pretty 
much disintegrate. This fish should only be cooked as fillets, because 
dealing with the fin rays on the plate is not a delight.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This fish shows up now and then in the 
Asian fish markets here in Los Angeles. It's not a fish you can just go 
out and buy, you deal with it when you see it.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Scales vary in size by species, but scrape off 
fairly easily with moderate flying about. You will have to shave some of them 
off with the sharp edge of your knife, particularly around the edges.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; The skin is thin, but has poor adhesion. You can 
cut through it around the edges just where the fin rays meet the body, 
and then simply peel it off. Start at the front with just a little 
scraping to get it going, then pull it back. The skin has a fair amount 
of shrink when heated, but due to poor adhesion it can be left on for 
frying fillets. In a poaching bath it will curl the fillet, but not too 
badly. I do recommend removing the skin for poaching because its flavor 
and texture, though not unpleasant, will interfere some with the delicate 
taste of the flesh. Skin off, the fillets will still curl during 
poaching, but in a spiral.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; The best way to handle this fish is to remove 
the head. This allows very easy removal of the innards which is difficult 
otherwise. To use the heads for stock you need to remove the gills, best 
done with a sturdy pair of long nose pliers.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; As with other fish of this form, the only 
practical way to fillet it is to make a cut down to the backbone along 
the centerline. Then fillet by shaving the flesh from the bones working 
from the backbone out to the edge, making sure the fin rays stay with the 
skeleton. If any come loose scrape them from the edge of the fillet. How 
neat the fillets are depends on your patience and the individual fish.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 10 ounce fish yielded 5-3/4 ounces of skin-on 
fillet (58%) which were 4-3/4 ounces skin removed (48%). This is good 
yield, but the fillets will be small.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Heads, bones, and fins made a quite usable stock 
simmered for 1/2 hour. There is almost no oil.</p>
