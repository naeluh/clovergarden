[<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>]
<p>
This trout is famous among fly fishermen in eastern North America. Brook 
Trout live along most of the east coast of Canada and down to Georgia in 
the United States, including the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River 
drainage basin. They can grow to 34 inches and 20 pounds 
but are more commonly around 10 inches.  Brook trout are now being farmed 
to some extent, and sold fresh, frozen and smoked. They are also raised in 
hatcheries for restocking streams and lakes, and have been introduced to 
other parts of the world. They are environmentally sensitive so are much 
used for envronmental research.

<p>This fish is similar to other trout, so the cooking information for 
<a href="sf_rainbz.html">Rainbow Trout</a> should work.</p>
