[European Trout, Caspian Trout; <i>Salmo trutta</i>]
<p>
This trout is endemic to Europe and the Caucasus, but has been 
introduced to much of the world, including North and South America, 
Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Hatcheries are widespread to 
restock rivers and lakes for sports fishing, particularly fly fishing. 
This trout is not much farmed, because it's a lot fussier about food 
and conditions than the Rainbow Trout.

<p>This fish is found in lake and river populations, but also in 
estuarian and saltwater populations, as in the Caspian Sea. In large 
bodies of water this trout can grow to 39 inches and 44 pounds, but in 
smaller bodies it is more commonly around 2.2 pounds. Spawning mortality 
is high for both males and females.</p>

<p>This fish is similar to other trout, so the cooking information for 
<a href="sf_rainbz.html">Rainbow Trout</a> should work.</p>
