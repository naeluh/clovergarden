[Ishkhan (Armenia); <i>Salmo ischchan</i>]
<p>
Four varieties of this relative of the Brown Trout are endemic to 
Lake Sevan in Armenia and one has been introduced to Issyk Kul lake in 
Kyrgyzstan. The largest variety can grow to almost 36 inches and 33 
pounds, but the photo specimen (var Gegharkuni) was 19 inches long 
and weighed 2-1/2 pounds.
<br class=cll></p>
<p>    
Winter bakhtak (var ischchan) - the largest, to 35.5 inches, 33 pounds.
<br>Summer bakhtak (var aestivalis)
<br>Gegharkuni (Salmo ischchan gegarkuni) - the photo specimen
<br>Bojak (var danilewskii) - dwarf, to 13 inches, 8.8 oz.

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Because of its large size, this fish is usually 
cooked as fillets. Because it's a moderately oily fish, it is suitable 
for fast high temperature cooking such as frying, broiling or grilling. 
The flesh is quite sturdy compared to Rainbow Trout, and it holds together 
very well in poaching. For frying, dust lightly with flour (I use salted 
rice flour) rather than using batters, and use simple seasonings and 
sauces that enhance flavor rather than overpower it. Do not skin the 
fish because much of the flavor is right under the skin.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; The photo specimen was purchased off the ice 
from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Altadena) for 2018 US $8.99 
/ pound. This market is within a couple of miles of Glendale, the 
Western Capital of Armenia.</p> 

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; In North America all the farmed trout are 
shipped "factory cleaned", and that's the way this fish was shipped. 
The gills still needed to be pulled.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This trout, like other trout, has very small 
thin scales - so small and thin that only larger fish need to have them 
scraped off. The specimen fish did not seem to have been scraped, but 
I was only able to find a very few tiny scales that could be scraped off
</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Fillets are easy to skin but the skin is thin and 
enhances the flavor, so this fish can be cooked and eaten skin-on. 
Fillets can be fried skin-on because the skin has very little shrink, 
and then relaxes.  Fry the skinless side first to stiffen the fillet, 
then flip. You'll see some shrink, but just pat it down with your 
turner and it will relax. I have poached fairly large pieces of fillet, 
and the skin hardly shrunk at all.</p>

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; The only problem filleting this fish is that 
there are no bones to follow from the top until you get near the backbone. 
As you cut down from the top of the fish you will meet resistance just 
before the backbone. This is a row of numerous pinbones you must cut 
through or break away from the backbone. I had trouble following the 
rib cage, so I just cut it from the backbone with kitchen shears and 
pulled the ribs out with long nose pliers. They pulled very easily.</p>

<p>Once you have the fillet free, set it skin side down and deal with 
the pin bones. The fillet feels very prickly, but the pin bones are so 
soft you only need to pull them up near the front of the fillet. The 
rest disappear in cooking.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; Trout is a high yield fish. The 2-1/2 pound 
specimen fish yielded 1 pound 9-1/4 ounces (63%). Of course that was 
from a factory cleaned fish.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Despite being a modeately oily fish, the heads, 
fins and bones make a serviceable soup stock, made by our 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Remove all oil 
using a gravy separator.</p>
