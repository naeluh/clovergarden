<h1>Trout Family</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_trout19g.jpg" alt="Whole Rainbow Trout" class=mrg>
[family <i>Salmonidae</i> Genus <i>Salmo</i> (Atlantic), 
<i>Oncorhynchus</i> (Pacific)]
<p>
Only <i>Salmo</i> and <i>Oncorhynchus</i> are officially trout, but a 
number of related fish are called "trout" (see below).</p>

<p>Among <i>Oncorhynchus</i> are Pacific Salmon, Apache trout (Arizona), 
Cutthroat trout (western North America), Gila trout (Arizona, New Mexico), 
Rainbow trout / Steelhead (western North America, northeast Asia and 
introduced everywhere).</p>

<p>Among <i>Salmo</i> are Atlantic Salmon, Adriatic trout, Brown trout 
(Europe and Asia), Marble Trout (southeastern Europe), Ohrid trout 
(Macedonia, Albania), Sevan trout (Armenia (native) and Kyrgyzstan 
(introduced)).

<h2>Rainbow Trout</h2>
<br><a href="sf_rainbz.html">
<img src="img/sf_trout19e.jpg" alt="Whole Rainbow Trout" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Oncorhynchs mykiss</i>]
<p>
Rainbow / Steelhead was reclassified from <i>Salmo</i> to 
<i>Oncorhynchs</i> in 1989, so it is now officially a Pacific Trout and 
considered identical with the Russian trout of the same name. Rainbows 
are native to the west coast of North America from the Mexican border 
north and around across the Aleutian Islands to Russia, and as far south 
as northern Japan. Rainbow trout are now farmed worldwide because the 
supply of native trout is totally insufficient to meet demand.</p>

<p>Rainbows are generally between 12 and 18 inches long unless they go 
to sea and become steelheads. Their bright rainbow colors fade quickly 
upon death so are not evident in the fish markets. The farm raised rainbow 
in the photo was 18-1/2 inches long and weighed 2 pounds 5-1/4 ounces 
factory cleaned, rather larger than average market size. It's flesh was 
a bright salmon color indicating it was fed a diet including the dye fed 
to farmed salmon.

<h2>Steelhead</h2>

[Baby Salmon (marketing); <i>Oncorhynchs mykiss</i>]
<p>Some rainbow trout stay in the lakes and rivers and are rainbows their 
entire lives. Others, even from the same batch of eggs, are rainbows for 
only one or two years, then lose their rainbow coloring and head 
out to sea to become Steelhead. A year or more later they return to the 
river of their birth to spawn, regaining their rainbow color. After 
spawning they turn silver gray again and head back to sea.</p>

<p>Nobody knows why some rainbows join the Navy and others stay at home, 
but those that do go to sea grow larger, live nearly twice as long (to 11 
years) and spawn over twice as many times (to 8 times). Steelhead can 
exceed 40 inches and 50 pounds but most are nearer 24 inches and 8 to 11 
pounds. They are considered threatened by habitat destruction.

<h2>Golden Trout - California</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/img/sf_troutcg01e.jpg" alt="Whole California Golden Trout" class=mrg>
[Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita]
<p>
This is the California State Fish,  which is found only in the Kern 
River drainage area of California - except the photo specimen, which was 
caught outside its native range. Actually, this fish has been introduced 
to a number of lakes and streams, but either dies out or quickly 
hybridizes with other species of trout. It is currently near threatened. 
The State of California is currently working to keep this fish alive 
and pure in its native habitat.

<h2>Golden Rainbow Trout</h2>
<br><a href="sf_troutgz.html">
<img src="img/sf_troutg04e.jpg" alt="Fresh Fish" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Oncorhynchs mykiss</i>]
<p>This is a color variant of the Rainbow Trout, developed by the fish farms 
and is <u>not to be confused</u> with the real California Golden Trout.

<h2>Brook Trout</h2>
<br><a href="sf_troutbz.html">
<img src="img/sf_troutb01e.jpg" alt="Live Brook Trout" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>]
<p>Actually a Char, not a Trout, but it's included here because it's what 
everyone east of the Mississippi calls a "Trout".  Brook Trout live 
along eastern Canada and down to Georgia in the United States, 
including the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage basin. 
They can grow to 34 inches and 20 pounds but are more commonly around 
10 inches.  Brook trout are now being farmed to some extent, and sold 
fresh, frozen and smoked. They are also raised in hatcheries for 
restocking streams and lakes, and have been introduced to other parts 
of the world. They are environmentally sensitive so are much used 
for environmental research.

<h2>Brown Trout</h2>
<br><a href="sf_troutez.html">
<img src="img/sf_troute01e.jpg" alt="Live Brown Trout" class=mrg></a>
[European Trout, Caspian Trout; <i>Salmo trutta</i>]
<p>
This trout is endemic to Europe and the Caucasus, but has been 
introduced to much of the world, including North and South America, 
Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Hatcheries are widespread to 
restock rivers and lakes for sports fishing. This trout is not 
much farmed, because it's a lot fussier about food and conditions 
than the Rainbow Trout. Europeans protest that this trout is far 
superior to Rainbow Trout, but mostly they eat farmed Rainbows, 
which are in much better supply.

<h2>Sevan Trout</h2>
<br><a href="sf_troutsz.html">
<img src="img/sf_troutls02e.jpg" alt="Whole Lake Seven Tout" class=mrg></a>
[Ishkhan (Armenia); <i>Salmo ischchan</i>]
<p>
Four varieties of this relative of the Brown Trout are endemic to 
Lake Sevan in Armania and one has been introduced to Issyk Kul lake in 
Kyrgyzstan. The largest variety can grow to almost 36 inches and 33 
pounds, but the photo specimen was 19 inches long and weighed 2-1/2 
pounds. &nbsp; <a href="sf_troutsz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Smoked Trout</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_troutsmk05d.jpg" alt="Whole Smoked Fish" class=mrg>
[<i>Oncorhynchs mykiss</i>]
<p>
Trout is a very oily fish so is suitable for smoking.  Smoked trout can be 
eaten skin-on, unlike smoked Whitefish (heavy scales) or smoked Mackerel 
(tough skin). The hot smoked photo specimen was 14-1/4  inches long and 
weighted 1 pound 3-3/8 ounces. Rainbow Trout, salt, brown sugar, natural 
wood smoke.
