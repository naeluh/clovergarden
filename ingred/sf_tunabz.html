   Bluefin Tuna is the most prestigious sushi / sashimi fish in Japan, and 
   the Japanese are eating them to extinction. Bluefins are listed as 
   <b>Critically Endangered</b> in all conservation lists, but the Japanese 
   simply don't care - the scarcer they are the more they'll pay, because 
   the higher the cost of a fish the better it tastes to the Japanese. It has 
   been reported that A single 
   large Atlantic Bluefin can now fetch as much as US $100,000 in the Japanese 
   fish markets. <b>Do not eat this fish</b>, and strongly discourage others 
   from eating it.</p>
   <p>Note that "farmed" is not an acceptable alternative, in fact for 
   Atlantic Bluefin (the most threatened) farming, which depends on wild 
   fish captured before reproductive maturity, is a major cause of depletion.
   For Pacific and Southern Bluefin, there has recently been some success in 
   captive breeding, but this is still in early experimental stages and is in 
   no way able to impact the market at this time.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Don't. In sushi bars avoid <b>Hon Maguro</b> (True 
Maguro), <b>Minami Maguro</b> (Southern Bluefin), and <b>Kuromaguro</b>. 
Discourage others from buying these items.</p>

<p><b>Acceptable:</b> &nbsp; Any called simply <b>Maguro</b> or <b>Toro</b> 
and reasonably priced are probably Ahi / Bigeye Tuna, but it doesn't hurt 
to ask what kind. Acceptable are Shiro Maguro (Albacore), Mebachi Maguro 
(Albacore). Binnaga Maguro (Albacore), Ahi (Big Eye), Kihada Maguro 
(Yellowfin).</p>
