<h1>Tuna Family</h1>

[family <i>Scombridae</i> (Mackerels)]
<p>
Tuna include the largest members of the Mackerel family. Unlike those 
called "Mackerel", tunas have deep flattened bodies. Most have scales 
only in a few places but that's enough to be kosher. Bluefin Tuna (all 
varieties) is to be avoided as all Bluefins are critically endangered. 
Yellowfin, Bonito, Tongal, Skipjack, Bigeye and Albacore are acceptable 
for eating.</p>

This small Indo Pacific  tuna is found from the east coast of Africa 
to Hawaii and is an important commercial fish. Unlike the Skipjack proper 
(<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) it stays fairly close to shore.  It can grow to 
39 inches and over 30 pounds, but the photo specimen was 19-1/2 inches and 
3-1/4 pounds, about typical for Southern California markets. This fish is 
not currently considered endangered, IUCN Red List status is 
NE (Not Evaluated).

<p>
These small tuna can grow to over 43 inches and over 76 pounds, but 
the photo specimen was 18-1/2 inches and 3 pounds 13 ounces, about average 
in Southern California markets. Skipjack is found worldwide in tropical and 
warm-temperate seas but not in the Eastern Mediterranean or Black Sea.</p>
<p>Commercially Skipjack is sold fresh, frozen and canned, with a small 
amount sold smoked and dried. This fish is not considered endangered. IUCN 
Red List status NE (Not Evaluated).

[Kuromaguro, Hon Maguro, Toro (Japan); <i>Thunnus thynnus</i>

<p>
Bluefin Tuna is the most prestigious sushi / sashimi fish in Japan, and 
the Japanese are eating them to extinction. Bluefins are listed as 
<b>Critically Endangered</b> in all conservation lists, but the Japanese 
simply don't care - the scarcer they are the more they'll pay, because 
the higher the cost of a fish the better it tastes to the Japanese. It has  
been reported that a single large Atlantic Bluefin can now fetch as much 
as 2010 US $100,000 in the Japanese fish markets. <b>Do not eat this 
fish</b>, and strongly discourage others from eating it.</p>
<p>Note that "farmed" is not an acceptable alternative, in fact for 
Atlantic Bluefin (the most threatened) farming, which depends on wild 
fish captured before reproductive maturity, is a major cause of depletion.
For Pacific and Southern Bluefin, there has recently been some success in 
captive breeding, but this is still in early experimental stages and is in 
no way able to impact the market at this time (2010).
