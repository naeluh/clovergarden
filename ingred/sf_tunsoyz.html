[Genus <i>Sardinella</i> various species, and <i>Dussumieria acuta</i>]
<p>
Tunsoy is the Philippine name for various Indo-Pacific herring. The 
photo specimen, from a package of salted and dried herring obtained 
from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, was rehydrated by soaking 
in water for 20 hours (yes it took that long to soften it up). It 
was 4-3/4 inches long and weighed 0.35 ounce rehydrated. This fish 
was eviscerated before drying in compliance with California health 
law.</p>
