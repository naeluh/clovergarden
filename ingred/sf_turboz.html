<p>
Turbot and Brill are flat fish called for in many European recipes, but 
none of these fish get any farther west than Iceland. They inhabit the 
coasts of Europe below the arctic circle, thorugh the Mediterranean, into 
the Black Sea and on the northwest corner of Africa. Suggested substitute, 
Petrale Sole (called "brill" in western Canada).
