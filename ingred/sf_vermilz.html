[Red Rock Cod; <i>Sebastes miniatus</i>]
<p>
This rockfish is found from mid British Columbia, Canada south to mid 
Baja California, Mexico. It can grow to nearly 36 inches and 15 pounds, 
but the photo specimen was 17-1/2 inches and 3-1/2 pounds, about normal 
market size. It's a prized eating fish, but, as with other rockfish, 
the fishery is tightly regulated so it is available mainly along 
the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<p>Vermilion flesh is tender, nearly white and has excellent flavor, 
light but not insipidely so. There is a thin layer of darker flesh right 
under the skin, mainly at the tail end, which is a bit stronger but not 
annoyingly so.</p>
<p>The flesh holds together well for any type of cooking, but does start 
to break into large flakes if simmered in soup. It is excellent poached 
or lightly powdered with rice flour and pan fried. It is not suitable for 
"whole fish" recipes because of skin shrink.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Vermilion can often be found in Asian markets in 
Los Angeles. It is a premium fish, but can sometimes be found on sale at 
as low as US $2.99 per pound. In other markets it may be sold as fillets 
mixed with other rockfish.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; Vermilion is covered with fairly large thin 
scales that scrape off fairly easily and fly about only moderately.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; There's nothing unusual in cleaning this fish, 
but the throat is quite strong, so cut it off with kitchen shears. The 
gills are large and fairly firmly attached, so cut them out with kitchen 
shears also.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> &nbsp; Vermilion is fairly easy to fillet with an easy 
to follow fin and bone structure, and the flesh holds together well. First 
cut off the head, turning the knife steeply under the gill covers to get 
the maximum amount of flesh. Outline the fillet by cutting through the 
skin along the top, across the tail and especially along the bottom. Cut 
from the top down following the bones to the backbone. Hop over the 
backbone at the tail and work forward. When I get to the ribcage I cut 
the ribs loose from the backbone with kitchen shears and pull them from 
the fillet with long nose pliers. They pull fairly easily and take almost 
no flesh. There are some very substantial centerline pin bones for the 
length of the body cavity but they are easy to locate. Pull them straight 
forward and they will come out fairly easily and cleanly.

<p><b>Yield:</b> &nbsp; A 3-1/2 pound fish yielded 1 pound 11-1/2 ounces 
of skin-on fillets (49%) and 1 pound 9-1/2 ounces skin-off (46%). fillet 
weights nclude the skirt which is fleshy and quite usable (if your fish 
was fresh). There will still be some flesh around the pelvic (bottom) 
fins which can't be removed until after a short simmer.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is extreme and unrelenting - it 
doesn't release from the flesh at all and will curl even thick fillets 
into a tight cylinder. It should be removed for any method of cooking. 
This is a shame since it has no strong or "off" flavor, but it can be 
tossed into the stock pot with the bones. It is thin but quite strong so 
it's easy to remove by the standard long knife and cutting board 
<a href="seafishsr.html"><b>Method</b></a>. Almost no flesh should be 
lost.</p>

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; The head, fins and bones simmered slowly for 30 
to 40 minutes make an excellent, almost clear stock with a light, 
pleasant flavor - it just needs a touch of salt to make soup. The stock 
will have a bit of oil which needs to be separated out - use your gravy 
separator.</p>
