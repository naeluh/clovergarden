<h1>Whitefish</h1>

[genus <i>Coregonus</i>: <i>C. clupeaformis</i> (N.America); 
<i>C. lavaretus</i> (Europe) and other species]
<p>
Whitefish is an Arctic and subarctic estuary, river and lake fish related 
to the salmon. Whitefish can grow to about 30 inches and about 20 pounds 
but the photo specimen was 19-3/4 inches and weighed 2-1/2 pounds factory 
cleaned. They are generally caught wild but are also farmed.

Whitefish are often smoked but are also an important fresh fish 
in the Frozen North, particularly in Russia, Alaska, Canada and the U.S. 
Great Lakes region. The roe is valued as a pretty good "caviar".</p>

<p>Whitefish flesh is is very mild and breaks up easily into medium size 
flakes. The skin side of the fillet is darker, particularly along the 
center, and slightly stronger in flavor but still mild. Fillets hold 
together well enough for poaching. Use a fairly delicate saucing to avoid 
overwhelming the fish.</p>

<p>I've been assured by a person with Native Alaskan experience that 
whitefish is good in chowders but best eaten as frozen chunks dipped in 
<a href="oils.html#seal">Seal Oil</a>. Unfortunately, seal oil's pretty 
scarce (and illegal) in Southern California.</p>

<p><b>Scales:</b> &nbsp; This fish is completely covered with shiny, 
medium size scales that scrape off quite easily.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; Like any relative of the trout, the body 
cavity is quite long, so there's a lot of stuff in it. On the other 
hand, like trout, this fish as sold in the United States is generally 
factory cleaned, with only the gills left in.</p> 

<p><b>Filleting:</b> &nbsp; This is not difficult, but there are not 
enough fin rays nor are they long enough to guide you from the top of the 
fish to the backbone, so you'll just have to pay attention. Be gentle with 
the filleting because the flesh is tender and tends to break apart with 
rough handling.  As you get to the backbone you'll have to break through a 
substantial row of centerline pinbones.</p>

<p>The rib cage is very long with lots of ribs and is pretty easy to 
follow with your filleting knife. Start by freeing the top and over the 
backbone at the tail, then shave the fillet from the ribs starting at the 
back. You could also just use kitchen shears to cut the ribs from the 
backbone. They pull easily and cleanly from the soft flesh of the fillet. 
In either case, also pull the centerline pinbones, straight forward as 
usual. They're easy to feel out in this fish and they pull easily 
and cleanly.</p>

<p><b>Skin:</b> &nbsp; Skin shrink is quite moderate and relaxes with 
cooking so fillets can be fried skin-on. Like other Trout relatives, 
Whitefish is most often cooked skin-on.</p>

<p><b>Yield:</b>  &nbsp; Yield is pretty decent. A 19-3/4 inch 2.5 pound 
(factory cleaned) fish yielded 1.7 pounds of skin-on fillet and 1.5 
pounds skinless (60%). Of course it won't be quite that good for a fish 
that hasn't been factory cleaned. 

<p><b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Whitefish heads, bones and fins make a light, 
very serviceable stock for soup, but with quite a bit of oil. Remove 
the oil using your gravy separator.</p>
