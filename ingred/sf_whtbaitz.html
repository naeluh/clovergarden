<h1>Whitebait</h1>

Whitebait is a non-specific term used for completely different fish in 
different regions of the world. The term is little used here in North 
America, but in most cases it indicates fish that are in the early 
juvenile stage. Many unrelated species are included in the term. Only 
the Chinese Whitebait are mature fish, but they maintain juvenile 
characteristics their entire lives. Whitebait are generally fish that 
can be caught in the juvenile stage in very large numbers. This capture 
has had deleterious effects on adult fish populations.

<h2>British / Northern European Whitebait</h2>

[Family <i>Clupeidae</i>, Sprats &amp; Herring]</p>

<p>Unlike the Whitebait of most of the world, those most common in the 
British Isles appear in the form of adult fish, just very small, up to 
about 3 inches, and quite thin. They are usually floured or lightly 
battered, deep fried and served "heads, guts and feathers", with a 
sprinkling of lemon juice. They are almost always purchased frozen, 
as they are quick frozen on the ships, immediately upon capture.</p>
<p>Some fisheries in the Baltic are considered sustainable due to the 
extremely high fecundity of the particular species, but other fisheries 
are having a deleterious effect on stocks of adult fish.

<h2>Australia / New Zealand Whitebait</h2>
<br><a href="sf_whtbanz.html">

<p>
[Family <i>Galaxidae</i>, mostly genus <i>Galaxias</i>]</p>
<p>
These fish are harvested as transparent juveniles, up to 2 inches long.  
In Australia there was once a significant fishery, but depletion of the 
adult fish populations from harvesting jeveniles was so severe commercial 
fishing is now banned. Recreational fishing for Galaxias is severely limited. 
In New Zealand, the commercial catch is severely limited, and recreational 
fishing is under strict controls. They are still in demand by gourmets, so 
the cost is very high. The photo is of an adult fish, about 4 inches long.

<h2>Chinese Whitebait</h2>
<br><img src="img/sf_nfsilv02e.jpg" alt="Chinese Whitebait" class=mrg>
[Silver Fish, Chinese Icefish, Chinese Noodlefish; Chaohu, Bai Fan Yu 
(China); C&aacute; Ngan Trung Hoa (Viet); Family <i>Salangidae</i> 
(Icefishes, Noodlefishes) of Order <i>Osmeriformes</i> (Smelts)]
<p>
These fish may be found in fresh water, saltwater, and brackish water, 
but most spawn in fresh water. Varieties vary from 1-1/2 inch to just 
over 6 inches long. They maintain their juvenile form through their 
entire life, which is usually 1 year, or at most 2 years. The longest 
in the photo was 2-5/8 inch long, and the ones in the photo at the top 
of the page grow to a little over 6 inches long.  Various sizes are 
to be found frozen in Asian markets here in Southern California.</p>
<p>These are in good supply, not endangered, cultured in ponds, lakes, 
and rivers, and quite affordable. They are often used in soups, but 
the big ones can be deep fried. The smaller ones would be a good choice 
for faking up New Zealand Whitebait Fritters, but, as any gourmet 
(especially an Asian gourmet) will tell you, without the high price 
they just can't taste very good - the cost is the most important  
flavor enhancement. For more on these fish see our
