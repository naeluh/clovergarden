<h1>Whitebait - Australia / New Zealand</h1>
<br><img src="img/sf_whtbglx05g.jpg" alt="Common Galaxias, Juvenile" class=mrg>
[Inanga, Inaka, Common Galaxias (Australia / New Zealand); Puye (Chile); 
Puyen (Argentina); <i>Galaxias maculatus</i> of family <i>Galaxidae</i>, 
(and many other Galaxias species)]
<p>
Here we will describe only the Common Galaxias (<i>Galaxias maculatus</i>) 
as it dominates the catch. Of the 117 known species of Galaxias, many are 
endangered, critically endangered, inconvenient to catch in quantity, or 
don't live in the region. Photo to the left is of Juvenile fish, as harvested 
for culinary use in New Zealand.

<p>This fish is found around Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, the coasts 
of South America from Chile around to southern Argentina, and the 
Falkland Islands. This species is IUCN Red List LC (Least Concern). 
It can grow to 7.48 inches, but is normally below 4 inches. As caught 
for culinary uses it is in a juvenile state and around 2 inches. These fish 
live in regions were rivers empty into the sea, and migrate into the rivers 
to spawn.</p>

<p>In Australia and Tasmania, commercial fishing for Whitebait is forbidden, 
and non-commercial is highly restricted by catch and season. There is some 
highly controlled commercial fishing around New Zealand. There the season 
is carefully timed to catch only Common Galaxias and not the other Galaxias 
which are more threatened. Even so, catch is declining due to destruction 
of habitat. It is illegal to catch adult fish except for native peoples, 
and even they are under restrictions.

<p>The Common Galaxia (and others when caught) are sold freshly caught when 
in season. A few are frozen for later, if they aren't all sold out. The 
favorite way to serve these in New Zealand is as "Whitebait Fritters". It 
is a kind of omelet, but properly only egg whites are used to avoid masking 
the taste of the very expensive fish. Retail cost in 2013 was around 
NZ $130 / kilogram (US $100 / pound), and there's a 25% tax on top of that.
