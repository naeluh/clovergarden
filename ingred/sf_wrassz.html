[family <i>Labridae</i>]
<p>
Wrasses are generally tropical and subtropical fish that appeared about 
65 million years ago just after extinction of the dinosaurs. Many smaller 
wrasses are "cleaner fish" which establish "cleaning stations" larger fish 
stop at to get parasites removed from inside their mouths and gills and from 
their skins. Some other "cleaner wrasses" make house calls to service shy 
fish or fish that don't travel much. Larger wrasses live on sea urchins, 
mollusks, lobsters, crabs and other hard shelled bottom creatures.</p>

[<i>Iniistius baldwini</i> alt <i>Xyrichtys baldwini</i>]
<p>
This is a Pacific fish, ranging from the Pacific side of Sumatra through 
Hawaii to the Gulf of California and along the tropical west coasts of North, 
Central and South America. It is found most intensely around Borneo and the 
north central coast of Australia, but ranges as far north as the southern 
tip of Japan.</p>
<p>This is a small fish. The largest in the batch was about 7-1/2 inches 
long and weighed 2-7/8 ounces, about as big as they get. This fish is 
amazingly thin, the 7-1/2 inch fish being only 0.7 inches thick. Colors and 
patterns varied but most had the black and white spot displayed by the 
center specimen.

<h2>California Sheephead</h2>
<br><a href="sf_sheepcz.html">

[<i>Semicossyphus pulcher </i>]
<p>
Found only from Monterey, California south to mid Baja California, this 
fish can grow to almost 36 inches and 35 pounds but the photo specimen 
was 16-1/2 inches and 2-1/2 pounds. The black coloration of the head and 
darkening tail indicates this fish was completing the transition from 
female to male (females are mostly red), which happens when a female 
reaches a length of 12 inches. This long lived slow reproducing fish is 
IUCN red listed as VU (Vulnerable) due to declining population.
