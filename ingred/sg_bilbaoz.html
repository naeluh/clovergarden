[Spain - Basque Region &nbsp; | &nbsp; Philippines]
<p>
</p>
This is the semi-cured cooking chorizo most available in North America, 
especially here in Southern California. There are several North 
American manufacturers of both Spanish and Philippine versions. 
They can be used interchangeably if necessary, though the Spanish 
version has a lot more paprika.<p>
<p>This style of semi-cured sausage originated in the Basque region 
of northern Spain. It's mildly spicy, and excellent in stews, soups, 
paella and with rice or lentils. It can be sliced and holds its 
shape well when wet cooked.</p>
<p>The photo specimens were made by <a href="http://www.donajuana.com">

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These sausages can be ordered on-line from 
Spanish emporiums, but around here, they are much more conveniently 
purchased from the frozen food cases of Philippine markets. We have 
one near every major hospital center, because health care in California 
runs on Philippine immigrants.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The Spanish variety can be kept a few weeks 
in it's unopened vacuum package, but should be used within a week or 
so after opening. The Philippine ones are always frozen, and will 
keep up to a year in the freezer compartment.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Remove the casing (if present) and cut to 
size for the recipe. They can tolerate fairly long cooking without 
falling apart.<p></p>
