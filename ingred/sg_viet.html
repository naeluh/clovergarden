<h1>Vietnamese Sausages</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>A part of French Indochina for about 150 years, Vietnam adopted a few 
items from French culinary culture, interpreting them in a uniquely 
Vietnamese way. One of these is Charcuterie, including the making of 
sausages. Some of these sausages are very important on both the appetizer 
platter and in the making of Vietnam's famous 
<a href="../recipes/swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Mi Sandwiches</b></a>. The 
word Gio in some of them refers to the multi-use pork paste on which 
they are based.</p> 
<p>Given the huge Vietnamese populations now established in Los Angeles 
and Orange Counties, California, many are available from Asian 
markets, particularly San Gabriel Superstore on Valley Blvd. in 
San Gabriel. They are all made in California, to the exacting 
standards of the community.  For those not fortunate enough to have 
these available, Andrea Nguyen's books <i>The Banh Mi Handbook</i> 
ISBN 978-1-60774-533-4 (hc) &amp; ISBN 978-1-60774-534-1 (ebook) and 
<i>Into the Vietnamese Kitchen</i> ISBN 978-1-58008-665-3 have recepies 
for several, including a few not listed here.

<h2>Gio Lua </h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Silky Pork Roll]
<br><img src="img/sg_vgiolua02e.jpg" alt="Cut Viet Gio Lua Sausage Roll" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the most widely eaten sausage in Vietnam, sometimes called 
"Vietnamese mortadella". It is typically 2-7/8 inches diameter and 
4 inches long, weighing 12 ounces. It was Purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $2.50 each - on Sale, 
probably usually around $3.49. Ing: Pork, modified tapioca starch, 
water, anchovy flavored fish sauce, corn starch, monosodium glutamate, 
sugar, sodium tripolyphosphate, egg white, baking powder, potato starch, 
pepper, garlic.

<h2>Gio Bi Sausage</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Pork Meat Loaf with Pork Skins Added]
<br><img src="img/sg_vgiobi02e.jpg" alt="Cut Viet Gio Bi Sausage Roll" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a popular pork sausage. The photo specimen, made in the 
traditional way, wrapped in banana leaf was 2-3/4 inches diameter 
and weighed 12 ounces. Pork skins are included in a number of Vietnamese 
sausages, adding a firm gelatinous texture which I rather like. 
It was Purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) 
for 2017 US $3.99 each. Ing: Pork, pork skin, modified tapioca starch, 
water, anchovy flavored fish sauce (water, anchovy extract, salt, 
sugar) cornstarch, monosodium glutamate, sugar, sodium tripolyphosphate, 
salt, baking powder, potato starch, pepper, garlic.

<h2>Gio Thu Sausage</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Vietnamese Head Cheese]
<br><img src="img/sg_vgiothu02e.jpg" alt="Cut Viet Gio Thu Sausage Roll" class=mrg>
<p>
Head Cheese is quite popular in Vietnam, but made a bit differently 
from in Europe and North America. It has less gelatin and includes pork 
ears with crunchy cartilage (white streaks). The photo specimen was 
2-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 13 ounces. It was Purchased from a 
large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $3.99 each. 
Ing: Pork ears, pork snouts, pork, water, sugar, potato starch, 
monosodium glutamate, salt, garlic powder, pepper, curing salt (salt, 
sodium nitrite 6.25%, FD&amp;C #40), black pepper, shallot, sodium 
tripolyphosphate, sodium erythorbate, spice, FD&amp;C red #40.

<h2>Thit Doi Heo</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Cured Pork Roll]
<br><img src="img/sg_vthitdoiheo02e.jpg" alt="Cut Viet Thit Doi Heo Pork Roll" class=mrg>
<p>
This Pork Roll is based on ham (cured pork) rather than Gio paste. 
Vietnamese do like to include pork skin in sausages, and in this case 
the sausage not only includes it, it's wrapped in it.  I like these 
because I do like the firm gelatinous texture of pork skins, and this 
one has plenty. It is a little more difficult to eat in Banh Mi 
sandwiches though, because the skin is a little tough and needs a 
firm bite. The photo specimen was 2-7/8 inches diameter and weighed 
13 ounces.Ing: Pork, pork skin, water, potato starch, tapioca flour, 
sugar, monosodium glutamate, salt, garlic powder, dried onion, black 
pepper, white pepper, curing salt (salt, sodium nitrite 6.25&, FD&amp;C 
red #40) sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium erythorbate, spice, food 
color FD&amp;C red #40.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Thit Nguoi</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Fully Cooked) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Chopped Ham with Natural Juices]
<br><img src="img/sg_vthitnguoi02e.jpg" alt="Cut Viet Thit Nguoi Sausage Roll" class=mrg>
<p>
This is another sausage based on ham rather than Gio paste. The photo 
specimen was 2-3/4 inches diameter and weighed 12 ounces. Ing: 
Pork, water, sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, cornstarch, cooking 
wine (water, rice, wheat, salt caramel), sodium tripolyphosphate, 
modified tapioca starch, Prague powder (salt, sodium nitrite max 6.25%, 
FD&amp;C red #40), white pepper, garlic, nutmeg, sodium erythorbate.
<br class=cll></p>  

<h2>Nem Chua</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Semi-Cured) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Nam Sausage]
<br><img src="img/sg_nemchua04e.jpg" alt="Two Viet Nem Chua Sausages" class=mrg>
<p>
This small sausage has a firm, slightly gelatinous texture due to 
pork skin included. It is fairly garlicky with a distinct chili taste, 
but very little heat. It needs to be cooked before consumption and is 
probably used as an ingredient in stir fries and the like, very 
similarly to Chorizo de Bilbao in the Philippines (also a semi-cured 
sausage). The photo specimens were 4-1/8 inches long and 1.2 inches 
diameter, weighing 2 ounces each. Ing: Pork, pork rinds, sugar, salt, 
monosodium glutamate, garlic, potato starch, baking powder, sodium 
tripolyphosphate, pepper, chili, glucono delta lactone, sodium 
erythorbate, sodium nitrite.
