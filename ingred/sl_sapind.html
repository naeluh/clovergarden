<p><i>Sapindales</i> is a large order, containing 9 families (APGII) 
some of which are of very great economic and culinary value. The 
culinary families each have their own page. While those family pages 
will usually be accessed directly, this page serves to organize them 
and show the diversity of the order. The photo is of a young Sugar 
Maple Tree (<i>Acer saccharum</i>) which belongs to the Soapberry Family.

The highly aromatic <i>Rutaceae</i> family (named for the bitter herb 
<a href="hb_ruez.html">Rue</a>), is most familiar from the genus 
<i>Citrus</i> and often called the Citrus family. Several other genera 
have a less prominent role in culinary affairs. The common edible citrus 
varieties are all tropical or subtropical and of Asian origin. The

The Soapberries are a diverse family of temperate to 
subtropical trees, shrubs and lianas (vines), a few of which have some 
significance as food - and others as cleansing agents. &nbsp;

</p><p>
The Cashews are a medium sized family of resinous trees 
and plants, mostly tropical but some temperate. Some provide highly 
prized edible fruit, but many have an irritant in their sap which causes 
rashes in humans, poison ivy being the most notorious.

The Torchwood family is a modest sized family of very resinous trees. 
Many are famous for resins used medicinally, as incense and for various 
industrial purposes, but the family does provide a few culinary items

</p><p>
The Mahogany family is more familiar for wood used in boats and fine 
furniture than as food, but a few varieties are of culinary value. A 
number of these trees bear edible fruit, which is enjoyed in the 
regions where the trees grow, but is seldom exploited commercially, 
and even then mostly on a local scale.
