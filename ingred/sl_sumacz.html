  [Sicilian sumac, Tanner's sumach; <i>Rhus coriaria</i> of family 
  Anacardiaceae (Cashew family)]
<p>
This is a very popular, though fairly mild, souring agent widely used in 
the Levant and Middle East. It is sold alone, and as a component of herb 
mixes, particularly with thyme (Za'atar). It is used in place of lemon in 
dry spice mixes, as lemon is not dry. <b>Caution:</b> Don't try to make 
this at home. North American Sumac is not the same species and can cause 
allergic reactions and poisoning. Sumac is available in just about any 
market serving a Levantine or Middle Eastern community.
