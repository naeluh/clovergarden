<h1 class=s>Balsamic Vinegar - "True" &amp; "Industrial"</h1>

<p>
Balsamic Vinegars have become essential cooking ingredients and condiments 
in Italy, and have spread to Europe and the Americas. It comes in two 
very different versions, <i>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale</i> and 
<i>Balsamico Industriale</i>. The two versions are used very differently, 
<i>Industriale</i> as an important ingredient in many recipes, and 
<i>Tradizionale</i> is used as a prestigious (and very expensive) 
condiment.</p>
<p>Both are made in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, with 
"True" balsamic restricted to the provinces of Modena and Reggio Emilia. 
Imitations of "Industrial" balsamic may be made in other regions, but 
the bulk of production is in Emilia-Romagna.

<h2>Balsamico Tradizionale DOP</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_dop01c.jpg" alt="DOP Seal" class=mrg>
<p>This Balsamic Vinegar is <u>not</u> used in recipes, except a 
drop or two as a garnish. It is most used for sipping or as a condiment. 
It is, by law, made only in the Modena and Reggio provinces of northern 
Italy. It is made on a relatively small scale by artisan producers, and 
no producer's product is quite the same as any other. Quality is 
certified by two consortia, and approved products are packaged by the 
consortium in the two bottle styles in the photo above. The bottle on 
the left is for the balsamic of Reggio, and the one on the right is 
for the balsamic of Modena.</p>
<p>Production is in a series of barrels, three minimum and up to seven, 
each differing in size. Mature vinegar is tapped from the smallest 
barrel, which is topped up from the next largest, and on up the line. 
The largest barrel is topped up with concentrated cooked and naturally 
fermented grape must. Unlike the other grades, no wine vinegar is 
included in the process.</p>
<p>This vinegar must be aged for at least 12 years (Vecchio). 
A 6-tablespoon (100-ml / 3.4 US oz) bottle of Vecchio can be had for 
less than 2019 US $70, and Extra Vecchio (25-year) can be had for under 
2019 US $200, but if you want the 50-year, it's gonna cost ya. It's 
impossible to accurately judge the age of vinegar from a continuous 
process like the barrel line, so the age rating is a subjective 
judgement by the consortium.</p>
<p>Vinegars that don't meet the strict requirements, or are simply made 
outside the DOP region, are sold in different shape bottles, often 
labeled <i>Condimento</i>. They may have widely differing amounts of 
age, and sell at widely variable prices, but good ones are normally 
around 2019 US $40 for a 500ml bottle and can be a good deal.</p>
<br>

<h2>Balsamico Industriale IGP</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_igp01c.jpg" alt="IGP Seal" class=mrg>
<p>This is the Balsamic Vinegar used in recipes and salads. It is 
probably the product <i>Balsamico Tradizionale</i> evolved from, wine 
vinegar sweetened with grape must (juice and pulp). Most is made in the 
Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Ingredients are generally 
wine vinegar, concentrated grape must, caramel color (E150D) and an 
antioxidant (like E224). Unsulphured versions (no E224) may be found.
</p>
<p>Processes and quality vary widely with manufacturer, as does the 
ratio of wine vinegar to grape must. There is no way to know the 
qualities of a product except to buy it and taste it. Even price is 
not a reliable guide, but look for the letters IGP on the label, 
along with the round blue and gold seal. This is a certification of 
origin and adherence to some controls. Fortunately, the price is more 
reasonable, ranging upward from 2019 US $2.59 for a 500 ml (16.9 US oz) 
bottle. This product is sold at 6% acidity as required for the IGP 
seal.</p>
<br>

<h2>Aged Balsamic Vinegar IGP</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_igp01c.jpg" alt="IGP Seal" class=mrg>
<p>This is an "in-between" product, made from vinegar and grape must 
like industrial, but aged in wooden barrels to improve its complexity 
and viscosity. The minimum age required by the IGP is 3 years. Some is 
aged in a multi-barrel line like the "traditional" balsamic, others in 
a single barrel, and aging time may vary, from 3 to 18 years. Pricing 
can be from 2019 US $7.50 for a 500 ml (16.9 US ounces) bottle to $50 
for a 250 ml (8.5 US oz) bottle. Aged Balsamic is usually 6% acidity. 
Some is sold at 4.5% to make it more like the "traditional", but this 
does not qualify for the 1GP seal which requires 6%.</p>
<br>

<h2>Condimento Bianco</h2>
<br>This is a variation of <i>Balsamico Industriale</i> for uses where 
the dark color of regular balsamic is not desired. It is made from 
white wine vinegar, white grape must, and an antioxidant such as 
E224. It is filtered to remove color and may be either perfectly 
clear, or a light amber. Price varies widely, from 2019 US $6.00 to 
$30 for a 500 ml (16.5 US oz) bottle. Unsulphured (no E224) versions 
can be found.<p></p>
