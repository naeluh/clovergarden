This is the "vinegar" of the Kodava (Coorg) people in southwest India. It 
is made from slightly fermented juice of <a href="cl_kokumz.html">
Gummi-Gutta</a> fruit, simmered down to a very dark reddish-purple syrup 
- very sour, but also fruity. It is on hand in just about every Kodava 
kitchen, and sold commercially in the region, but not much elsewhere. 
&nbsp; <span class=sm>Image from 
<a href="http://coorgshoppe.com/">Coorg Shoppe</a> (they ship 
internationally)</span>.</p> 
<p>This is made by piling very ripe Gummi-Gutta fruit in a straining 
basket and setting it out over a pan for a few days until all the juice 
has seeped out of the fruit and into the pan. The amber juice is them put 
in a very deep (because it foams a lot) clay pot and simmered down until 
it reaches a syrup consistency. By this time it will have become a dark 
red-purple color. It is then put up in glass jars or bottles.</p>

The photo to the left shows ripe <a href="cl_kokumz.html">Gummi-Gutta</a>
(<i>Garcinia gummi-gutta</i> formerly <i>Garcinia cambogia</i>) fruit 
(shape varies). This fruit is also dried and used as a souring agent in 
Kerala to the southeast of Coorg.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; This product is pretty much 
unavailable in North America. Same for the fruit, which is deep tropical 
and can't be grown reliabey even in southern Florida - and it's pretty 
picky about where it grows in the deep tropics too. Bottles can be 
ordered on-line from Coorg sources, and may get through U.S. Customs.</p>
<p><b>Storing:</b> &nbsp; Once you have some, it will last for years in 
a sealed bottle. It slowly looses its fruitiness, but the sourness stays 
with it.</p>
<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Kachampuli is used mainly for meat (especially 
pork) and fish dishes. It is usually added near the end of cooking.</p>
<p><b>Substitutes:</b> &nbsp; These have been suggested. The Essential 
Kodava Cookbook was written by two Kodava ladies who were brought up in 
Kodagu (Coorg). <a href="http://www.acookeryyearincoorg.com/">Shalini</a> 
lives there and has made Kachampuli from ripe fruit.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Malt Vinegar: &nbsp; (The Essential Kodava Cookbook). Use best 
  quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Dried Gummi-Gutta: &nbsp; (Shalini) Known as "fish tamarind" or 
  kudampuli in Kerala state. Soak in hot water 1/2 hour and use the 
  water. Adjust water in recipe to compensate. - or - Soak in hot water 
  until softened, then grind and strain. Simmer down until you get a 
  syrup. Not as fruity as the real thing, but similarly colored and sour.
  </p></li>
<li><p>Lime Juice: &nbsp;  (Shalini) No color, but pretty good 
  substitute for finishing meat dishes.</p></li>
<li><p>Tamarind Extract: &nbsp; (Shalini) Good for vegetable and fish 
  dishes.</p></li>
<li><p>Malt or Cane Vinegar: &nbsp; (Shalini) Good for drier meat dishes 
  that don't contain coconut.  I would strongly recommend Datu Puti 
  Sukang Iloco Native Vinegar (sugarcane juice vinegar) from the 
  Philippines. It has excellent flavor and a good dark color, available 
  in just about all Philippine markets. Note that you should use 1-1/2 
  times as much vinegar as Kachampuli as it is not as strong.</li>
<li><p><a href="cl_kokumz.html">Kokum:</a> &nbsp; (Shalini). Soaked 
  and reduced to paste and strained as for dried Gummi-Gutta (above), or 
  simply cook dried chunks in the recipe and remove them before serving. 
  Good for fish and vegetable recipes. Black Kokum is easily available 
  in Indian markets here in North America.</li>
