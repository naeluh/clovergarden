<h1>Sapote</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Sapotes (<i>Sapotaceae</i>) have long been important trees in the 
tropical Americas, Africa and Southeast Asia. They have provided sap of 
industrial importance, fruit and wood - hard to extremely hard wood. They 
range from small to rather large trees, like the one the balata log being 
cut in Guyana came from (wood so hard it does not float and can't be 
nailed). &nbsp; <small>Photo by Jesseknight contributed to the 
public domain.</small>

<p>Note that some fruits called "sapote" are not actually 
<i>Sapotaceae</i>, because "zapote" derives from Nahuatl "tzapotl", a 
general word for soft sweet fruit. Two important non-sapotes are linked 
from here.</p>

[Abio; Abieiro (Portugal), Yellow Star Apple (Trinidad); Camio, Caimito 
amarillo (Colombia); Luma, Cauje (Ecuador); Temare (Venezuela); 
<i>Pouteria caimito</i>]
<p>
This yellow - green fruit is native to the headwaters of the Amazon (Eastern 
Peru, western Brazil, southern Venezuela). They are now grown to some extent 
in southern Florida and northeastern Queensland, Australia. The fruit tastes 
much like Sapodilla but has a smoother texture. It is mostly eaten fresh but 
is also used to flavor ice cream and yogurt and other light flavored dishes.

<h2>Argan</h2>
<br><img src="img/oi_argan02e.jpg" alt="Argan Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Argania spinosa</i>]
<p>
This tree, native to semi-desert regions of Morocco and Algeria,
bears pointed oval fruits up to 1-1/2 inches long. The peel is bitter. The 
thin flesh has an attractive sweet aroma but unpleasant taste. Of interest 
is the large hard seed, source for Argan Oil. Until recently, this oil was 
almost unknown outside Morocco where it is used as a dipping oil and as a 
cooking oil substituted for olive oil, It is also important in cosmetics, 
having a very high vitamin E and phenol content. This oil is now much more 
widely known due to conservation efforts, and is now exported as a high 
value product, making properly managing the trees economical.

This tree is native to southern Mexico and Central America but is now 
grown in Brazil, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The fruit grows to about 2.8 
inches long with sweet flesh having a texture likened to cooked egg yolk.

<h2>Chicle</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_chicle01k.jpg" alt="Tree" class=mrg>
[<i>Manilkara chicle</i>]
<p>
This tree, native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is famous as 
the original source of chewing gum. Today few gum makers still use natural 
chicle, most now use butadiene-based synthetic rubber. The gum is 
harvested by tapping the trees the same as rubber trees. Because they 
have been over harvested, a lot of the natural gum now comes from 
<i>Manilkara zapota</i> (Sapodilla) or <i>M. bidentata</i> (Balata, 
once famous for golf ball coverings).

<h2>Gutta-percha</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_gutap01h.jpg" alt="Drawing" class=mrg>
[Genus <i>Palaquium</i> species]
<p>
This tree is native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The sap, 
also called Gutta-percha, was a very important electrical insulator, 
particularly for telegraph cables from about 1845 until the invention of 
modern plastics. In more recent times it has had important surgical and 
dental uses as it is biologically inert and has a convenient melting 
point. Its use as the core of golf balls revolutionized the sport. Today 
it is less used, and sometimes replaced by a similar but less expensive 
sap called balata from a similar and related tree (<i>Manilkara 
bidentata</i>) that grows in the Caribbean region. The fruits of a 
number of <i>Palaquium</i> species are edible and may be up to 2-3/4 
inches long but are not of commercial importance.

<h2>Lucuma</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_lucuma01k.jpg" alt="Whole Fruit" class=mrg>
[<i>Pouteria lucuma</i>]
<p>
Native to the Andean region of Peru, this large, very nutritious fruit has 
rather dry bright yellow, sometimes fibrous, flesh with the texture of 
cooked egg yolks and a flavor similar to maple and sweet potato. It has 
been grown successfully in Southern California but is not yet a 
significant crop here, though it is now a significant crop in Laos and 
Vietnam. It has recently found a market as a dried flavoring ingredient.

<h2>Mamey Sapote</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_mamey06e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Fruit" class=mrg>
[PLU 4310; <i>Pouteria sapota</i>]
<p>
This tropical tree is native to southern Mexico but is now grown 
in Central and parts of South America, Southeast Asia and southern 
Florida. The fruit is ripe when the flesh yields to the press of a thumb, 
a bit softer than for a ripe avocado - you really don't want to even try 
eating one that isn't fully ripe.</p>
<p>Ripe ones are eaten raw and also used 
to flavor milkshakes, smoothies, ice cream and fruit bars. The texture 
is soft and slightly fibrous. The fruit is aromatic, almost like a 
cherry filled chocolate. The larger of the photo specimens, grown in 
USA, was 7-3/4 inches long, 4-1/8 inches diameter and weighed 2 pounds. 
The price has been coming down, and I've recently seen it for 2019 
US $2.29 / pound in a large multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles 
(Altadena).

<h2>Miracle Fruit</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_miracle01h.jpg" alt="Miracle Fruit on Tree" class=mrg>
[Sweet berry; Agbayun,Taami, Asaa, Ledidi (West Africa); 
<i>Synsepalum dulcificum</i>]
<p>
Native to West Africa, this fruit, when consumed, causes substances as 
sour as lemon or lime juice to taste sweet. The fruit itself is just 
mildly sweet. The effect is from a protein called <i>miraculin</i> which 
apparently binds to the sweetness receptors of the tongue causing them 
to sense sour rather than sweet and report sweet to the brain. The effect 
can last up to 60 minutes. Commercial exploitation has seen minor success, 
and the fruit is now grown in Ghana, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, and South 
Florida, but <i>miraculin</i> is now being produced commercially using 
genetically altered tomato plants. The fruit is highly perishable, 
lasting only 2 to 3 days, and <i>miraculin</i> is destroyed by even 
moderate heating, so the flesh is usually distributed in freeze dried 
form, which lasts 10 to 18 months depending on storage conditions.

<h2>Sapodilla</h2>

California, Florida); Chicoo, Sapote (India, Pakistan); Hong xiem, 
Lang mirt, Xa po che (Vietnam); Lamoot (Thai, Laos, Cambodia); 
<i>Manilkara zapota</i>]
<p>
Native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, this popular 
fruit is now grown in the Philippines, India and Pakistan. The flesh is 
soft, moderately sweet and almost gritty in texture and has been compared 
to a candied pear in flavor. The cut photo specimen is nowhere near ripe 
enough to eat and will be very astringent due to the saponin content. 
The flesh, when fully ripe is a darker brownish orange. They do not 
ripen on the tree, only after being picked.  The photo specimens, 
purchased from an Asian market in Los Angeles were typically 3.6 inches 
long, 2.75 inches diameter and weighed 8-1/2 ounces  
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Shea Nut</h2>
<br><a href="so_sheaz.html">
<img src="img/so_shea02h.jpg" alt="Whole Shea Nuts" class=mrg></a>
[Shi Tree; Gonja (Niger-Congo); <i>Vitellaria paradoxa</i> obs. 
<i>Butyrospermum parkii</i>]
<p>
This fruit tree is native across equatorial Africa (not quite touching 
the coast on either east or west), but Turkey is now also a major grower. 
The flesh of the fruit (about 2-1/4 inches long) is tart, edible, and 
nutritious, but rather thin, surrounding a large seed. The seed is the 
primary interest, as it yields a large amount of oil. This oil, very high 
in saturated and monosaturated fats, is called shea butter. It is 
solid at a cool room temperature, but this solidity is quite variable 
depending on the saturated / monunsaturated ratio provided by individual 
trees. Some separates, so liquid oil (mostly monounsaturated oleic acid) 
can be siphoned off.</p>
<p>Unrefined Shea Butter has an antioxident content similar to olives, 
with a profile similar to green tea. In the West, shea butter is used 
mainly for cosmetics, but in equatorial Africa it is a major cooking 
oil, and is also used to make soap. IUCN Red List VU (Vulnerable).

[Vu sua (Vietnam); Cainito, Caimito, Abiaba, Pomme du Lait, Estrella, 
Milk Fruit, Aguay. Golden Leaf Tree; <i>Chrysophyllum cainito</i>]
<p>
Native to lowland Central America and the Caribbean, this fruit is now 
popular in Vietnam as well. The fruit comes in three colors: purple 
(right photo), brownish green (left photo), which has a thinner skin and 
juicier flesh, and a rare yellow version. The flesh of both is soft, 
sweet and interestingly aromatic, but there's not a lot of it due to the 
1/4 inch thick rind. The photo specimens were from Vietnam, purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel). The 
largest green one was 3.33 inches diameter and weighed 11.2 ounces, 
67% edible. Cost was 2020 US $5.98 / pound. The largest purple one was 
3.06 inch diameter and weighed 8.5 ounces, 68% edible. Cost was 
2020 US $2.99 / pound.

<p>
This tree is native to Southeast Asia from Thailand to Papua New 
Guinea and northern Queensland, Australia. The fruits are a traditional 
food of the Torres Strait Islanders (between the tip of Queensland and 
Papua New Guinea). Note: the photo is actually of <i>M. zapote</i> 
because no usable <i>M. kauki</i> photo was found. In Australia 
<i>M. kauki</i> is often used as a grafting root stock for 
<i>M. zapote</i> so you can imagine the photo specimens have 
<i>M. kauki</i> roots.
