This fruit tree is native across equatorial Africa (not quite touching 
the coast on either east or west), but Turkey is now also a major grower. 
The flesh of the fruit (about 2-1/4 inches long) is tart, edible, and 
nutritious, but rather thin, surrounding a large seed. The seed is the 
primary interest, as it yields a large amount of oil. This oil, very high 
in saturated and monounsaturated fats, is called shea butter. It is 
solid at a cool room temperature, but this solidity is quite variable 
depending on the saturated / monounsaturated ratio provided by individual 
trees. Some separates, so liquid oil (mostly monounsaturated oleic acid) 
can be siphoned off.</p>
<p>Unrefined Shea Butter has an antioxidaent content similar to olives, 
with a profile similar to green tea. In the West, shea butter is used 
mainly for cosmetics, but in equatorial Africa it is a major cooking 
oil, and is also used to make soap. IUCN Red List VU (Vulnerable).

Shea butter is traditionally made by hand, a very labor intensive process. 
The seeds are shelled out of the fruit, then cleaned, followed by 
crushing and grinding, then separation by simmering water. While this 
is still done in the villages of Africa, commercial processing for export 
is increasingly mechanized and often uses hexane extraction.

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; Cans, Jars and Bags of Shea Butter are easily 
purchased on the Internet. It is available in Virgin and Naturally 
Refined varieties. Most is specifically sold for use as an emollient  
for cosmetics and as a body lotion and moisturizer, but better grades 
could also be used for cooking.</p>

<p><b>Storing:</b> &nbsp; Given its composition, this should be a very 
stable oil, so, stored in a sealed container away from heat and sunlight, 
it should last a year.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Given its composition, this should be a 
fairly high temperature frying oil with good durability.</p>

<p><b>Soap:</b> &nbsp; In its native range, and by artisan soap makers, 
this oil is used as an ingredient in soaps, usually as a minor 
constituent because it as a fair amount of unsaponifiable components 
that would make the soap softer and reduce its cleaning power.

<p>There is a proposed grading system. Personally, I'd probably 
choose Grade B for cooking, unless I was deliberately replicating 
African village cooking.</p>
 
<ul>
<li><b>A &nbsp; Raw:</b> &nbsp; Unrefined and extracted with water. This 
  will look like whipped butter, but may have a grayish cast. It has a 
  nutty aroma.</li>
<li><b>B &nbsp; Refined:</b> &nbsp; This grade would be lighter in color 
  and with less aroma.</li>
<li><b>C &nbsp; Highly Refined:</b> &nbsp; This grade would be pure white 
  with no noticeable aroma, no contaminants and almost no vitamins. 
  Hexane or other solvents will have been used for extraction.</li>
<li><b>D &nbsp; Lower Grade:</b> &nbsp; The lowest grade without 
  contaminants.</li>
<li><b>E &nbsp; Lowest Grade:</b> &nbsp; This grade will have 
  contaminants.</li>
</ul>
