<h1>Vinegars <small>&amp;</small> Souring Agents</h1>  
<hr class=hr2>
<span class=bg>Sourness is one of the basic flavors we perceive, and is 
caused by acidity. It can provide lightness and interest to food that 
would otherwise be heavy or bland - note the radical difference adding a 
little lemon juice to a bean soup makes. Of course sourness can also be 
an indicator that food is going bad - vinegars and the like are made by 
carefully controlled spoilage.</span>

<h2 class=h1 id="vin">Vinegars</h2>

<p>Vinegars are made by fermentation from many foods that have a high sugar 
or starch content. Fruits and other sugar sources go through a double 
or triple fermentation: from sugar to alcohol (by yeast) then alcohol to 
acetic acid (by bacteria). Starchy foods go through either malting (barley) 
or a starch to sugar fermentation (rice), then sugar to alcohol, alcohol to 
acetic acid. High grade vinegars will then be aged in wooden barrels or 
pottery jars to mature the flavors.</p>

<p>With the exception of White Distilled Vinegar, vinegars carry a distinctive 
flavor from the ingredients used, and are affected by the quality of those 
ingredients, so taste will not be uniform brand to brand.</p>

<p>Many health and healing claims are made for vinegars, particularly apple 
cider vinegar, but actual medical research seems to be pretty scarce so the 
evidence is all "hear-say".</p>

<p>Vinegars. like oils, are very important cooking ingredients and a well 
prepared kitchen stocks <b>Apple Cider</b>, <b>Rice</b>, <b>Balsamic</b> 
(Industrial), <b>White Distilled</b> and <b>Wine</b> vinegars, with others 
added according to individual taste and ethnicity of the cuisine.</p>

<h2>Apple Cider Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Aceto di Mele (Italy); 
Apfelessig (German)]
<br><img src="img/so_apple06m.jpg" alt="Glass of Apple Cider Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
Made from apples fermented into hard cider, this vinegar is quite popular 
in North America - but <b>beware!</b> Most of what tries to pass as 
"Apple Cider Vinegar" in the stores is nothing of the kind. Look 
carefully and you will find it's made from white distilled vinegar with 
apple juice added - it's just "apple flavored" vineger. Even the leading 
brand, Heinz, is real in quart bottles or smaller, and fake in larger 
containers.</p>
<p>Apple cider vinegar has a large cult following among the health 
conscious, and many extreme claims are made for it. Unfortunately, little 
actual medical research has been done, but that which has been done shows 
<u>modest</u> healthful effects. In any case, it's not likely to do you 
any harm, unless you over-do it, and many say it helps them. Personally, 
I'm a great fan of natural vinegars, but not just Apple Cider Vinegar.
</p> 
<p>Cider vinegar's flavor may not work well with some recipes, and it 
may not be appropriate for some ethnic cuisines. Some older ethnic 
cookbooks in English call for cider vinegar because they presume you 
can't get the right kind. On the other hand, many cultures do use it, 
even in regions not noted for apples. The most common in North America 
is Heinz brand, available just about everywhere (quart size or smaller). 
The photo specimen is Bragg brand, certified organic raw apple cider 
vinegar and purified water, 5% acidity, product of USA. This product 
is unfiltered and includes sediment (mother of vinegar) in the bottom 
of the bottle. Flavorful cider vinegars are also made in France, Italy 
and Turkey.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=balsami>Balsamic Vinegar: &nbsp; "True" <small>&amp;</small> "Industrial" </h2>
<br><a href="so_balsamz.html">
<img src="img/so_balsam01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Industrial Balsamic Vinegar" class=mrg></a>
<p>What is now called "Industrial" Balsamic was probably the original 
version from ancient times, wine vinegar sweetened with grape must. It 
has evolved into the very expensive <i>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale</i>, 
made in a series of barrels and aged at least 12 years. "True" Balsamic 
is made only in Modena and Reggio provinces in northern Italy, and most 
"Industrial" is also made in that region. "Industrial" balsamic is used 
throughout Italy and the world as an important recipe ingredient. "True" 
balsamic is used by the drop as a special condiment.</p>
Condimento Bianco is a variation of "industrial" balsamic made from white 
wine vinegar and white grape must, and filtered. It may be clear or 
light amber, and is used in salads and other applications where the dark 
color of Balsamic is not desired. Balsamic vinegars are so important they 
now have their own  
<a href="so_balsamz.html"><b>Balsamic Vinegar</b></a> page.<p></p>

<h2 id=sukang>Cane Vinegar</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_cane01k.jpg" alt="Glasss of different Cane Vinegars" class=mrg>
This vinegar is made wherever sugar cane is grown, but commercially 
exported from the Philippines, a land where good vinegar is really 
appreciated. Cane juice is fermented as if to make rum, but instead of 
distilling, it is fermented into vinegar. Quality and flavor vary by 
brand.
<p>To the left in the photo is a natural cane vinegar that is my favorite 
vinegar. I use it anywhere the color won't be a problem. Datu Puti brand 
Sukang Iloco (Native (natural) Vinegar). The ingredient list is: 
"Naturally fermented from sugar cane juice". It was purchased from a 
Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2017 US $1.69 for 25.4 
ounces.</p>
<p>The sample to the right is Datu Puti brand Sukang Maasim. Ingredients: 
cane vinegar, water. I suspect an unstated clouding agent is included in 
that vinegar - Filipinos seem to expect vinegars to be slightly cloudy. 
The light vinegar is harsher with a less distinct flavor compared to the 
dark. Both are 4.5% acidity.</p>

<p>Note that in the Philippines, the famous Iloco vinegar is often 
flavored with the leaves of <a href="sr_spurge.html#samak">samak</a> 
(Macaranga), but the FDA may object to that version here as 
<i>Macaranga</i> are spurges, and spurges are commonly toxic. Sukang 
Iloco is an ingredient in Vigan Longanisa sausage as well as in many 
other regional recipes, and as a dip, and for medicinal purposes 
(disinfectant and on the forehead for fevers). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=china>Chinese Vinegars</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_china01d.jpg" alt="Glasses of various Chinese Vinegars" class=mrg>
Chinese vinegar comes in three basic varieties, Black, Red and White.  
All can be made from rice, but the black may also be made from other 
grains. Quality variations for Chinese products are extreme. Check the 
ingredient labeling but be aware it is often as wrong as the grammar in 
the instructions you get with Chinese products. Best strategy, find a good 
brand and stick with it.
<p><b>Black Rice Vinegar</b> [Brown Rice Vinegar, Chinkiang Vinegar, Chekiang 
  vinegar, Chenkong vinegar, Zhejiang vinegar]  is particularly popular in 
southern China. Brands made in Chinkiang (Zhejiang) province are considered 
the best. Like Balsamic it is dark and has a deep flavor, but the taste is 
very different. Black vinegar is often used as a dipping sauce. 
Gold Plum is often recommended as the best brand of Chinkiang and is the 
one I usually use. Ingredients: water, glutinous rice and salt, 5.5% 
Acidity.</p>

<p><b>Ladchen Vinegar</b> is an example of other dark vinegars. The one I 
have on hand, from China, is made from sorghum, barley and peas. Flavor is 
quite similar to the Chinkiang, but a shade lighter.</p>

<p><b>Red Rice Vinegar</b> [Red Rice Vinegar] doesn't look a whole lot 
redder than the black, but the flavor is much lighter and almost spicy. 
It is used as a dipping sauce and in soups, with noodles and in seafood 
dishes. Often recommend brands are Pearl River Bridge and Koon Chun but 
the one in the photo is Pat Chun. Ingredients: water, glutinous rice, 
salt, FD&amp;C red #40. Acidity 2.5%.</p>

<p><b>White Rice Vinegar</b> [Rice Wine Vinegar] is similar to the 
Japanese and is used in stir fries, pickles and  sweet-and-sour dishes. 
It has a more delicate flavor than the others. It is available in regular 
and "Gourmet Aged" grades in markets serving an East Asia community. The 
photo specimen is the darker "Aged" version, which I hold is very much 
worth the higher price, from Kong Yen Foods, Taiwan. Ingredients: rice, 
malt. Acidity above 6%.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Coconut Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Sukang Niyog (Philippine)]
<br><img src="img/so_coconut01k.jpg" alt="Glasses of Coconut Vinegars" class=mrg>
<p>
Coconut vinegar is used in India and Southeast Asia, including the 
Philippines. It is mild with a somewhat musty flavor. The photo shows a 
naturally fermented vinegar that has an almost smoky flavor. Ingredients: 
coconut water.  The sample on the right has a less distinct flavor. 
Ingredients: natural vinegar, water, 4% acidity. I suspect there is also 
an unstated clouding agent, as Filipinos seem to expect vinegars to be
somehat cloudy. Both are products of the Philippines. Coconut vinegar 
can be found in markets serving a Philippine community (around here 
there's one near every major hospital). 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Coconut Sap Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sukang Tuba (Philippine)]
<br><img src="img/pm_cocon02m.jpg" alt="Glass of Coconut Sap Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
This vinegar is naturally fermented from the same flower sap that coconut 
sugar is made from. The cloudiness is natural, and there is some sediment 
(mother of vinegar) in bottom of the bottle. This is a premium vinegar, 
to be used as a dip and in salad dressings. It is aromatic and has a 
vague sweetness. It was purchased from a Philippine market in Los 
Angeles (Eagle Rock) for 2019 US $3.99 for 25.4 ounces (750 ml). 100% 
Pure Suka Tuba. Mr. Pinakurat brand, product of the Philippines.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Date Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; This vinegar is popular in the 
Near East, but I haven't noticed it here in Los Angeles - I'm sure it's 
here somewhere, I'll just have to look more carefully.<p></p>

<h2>Flavored Vinegars</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_tarag01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Tarragon Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
These are generally white or red wine vinegar with herbs and spices added 
to the bottle, or infusions added to the vinegar. The objective is to capture 
the flavors in an easily usable form. Tatragon vinegar is probably the 
best known. Since the flavor of tarragon doesn't survive drying, vinegar is 
a way to deliver that flavor when fresh tarragon isn't available. Note that 
there are health risks to doing these yourself, so it's generally better 
to purchase them. The photo sample is Heinz Tarragon Vinegar. Ingredients: 
distilled white vinegar, malt vinegar, spice oil (tarragon), water, 5% 
acidity.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Fruit Vinegars</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_pineapp01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Pineapple Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
Since vinegar can be made from anything with sufficient sugar, and since it 
takes on flavors from the ingredients from which it is made, the field is 
wide open for production of specialty vinegars. Examples are Pomegranate, 
Orange and Raspberry vinegars. The photo sample is Pineapple vinegar, 
very nice for salads
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=grape>Grape Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Raisin Vinegar]
<br><img src="img/so_grape01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Grape Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
This is wine vinegar made in Islamic countries where you'd roast in 
Hell for eternity if Allah saw you were making wine - but you can't make 
vinegar without making alcohol first. Some of it's pretty good wine 
vinegar too. Somehow the Turks got a special dispensation from Allah 
because they make and consume alcoholic beverages (either that or they're 
all going straight to Hell with the rest of us), but for the rest of 
Islam it's forbidden.</p>
<p>This vinegar is generally made in a single multi-stage process so the 
makers can't be accused of making wine. Note that during the (long, long 
passed) height of Islamic culture, wine was made and enjoyed in countries 
where you'd be flogged or beheaded for it today. The photo specimen is 
from Syria. Ingredients: grape vinegar, water. As to the strength, the 
label says "Natural %", obviously not designed by an English speaking 
person.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Kachampuli</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Kaachambuli]
<br><a href="so_kaachz.html">
<img src="img/so_kach01m.jpg" alt="Bottle of Kachampuli" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This is the "vinegar" of the Kodava (Coorg) people in southwest India. It 
is made from slightly fermented juice of <a href="cl_kokumz.html">
Gummi-Gutta</a> fruit, simmered down to a very dark red-purple sour, but 
also fruity, syrup. It is on hand in every Kodava kitchen, and sold 
commercially in the region, but not much elsewhere. Details and suggested 
substitutes can be found on our <a href="so_kaachz.html"><b>Details and 
Cooking</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Lemon Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Lemon Sirkesi]
<br><img src="img/so_lemon01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Lemon Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
Yes, even lemons have enough sugar to ferment into vinegar. This product 
definitely has a lemon flavor, but also a vinegar flavor. The photo sample 
was made in Turkey. Ingredients: lemon vinegar, acid regulator (citric acid), 
lemon emulsion, antioxidant (sodium metabisulfite), natural lemon flavor.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Malt Vinegar</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_malt01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Malt Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a premier dipping vinegar (as in English fish and chips) because its 
effect is less harsh than other common vinegars. I used to use a lot of it 
before I settled on the naturally fermented <a href="sours.html#sukang">Sukang Iloco</a>, 
but I still use it for specific recipes. Malt vinegar is properly made by 
malting (sprouting) barley (and perhaps other grains) to turn the starches 
to sugar. The malt is then fermented into ale, and the ale fermented into 
vinegar. Here in Los Angeles very few markets carry it, but many restaurant 
supply stores do - to supply British style restaurants. The photo sample, 
from Smart and Final, boasts ingredients: malt vinegar, water, 5% acidity.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Palm Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sukang Paombong (Philippine)]
<br><img src="img/so_palm01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Palm Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
Sukang Paombong is another of the fine vinegars made in the Philippines. 
with a rich flavor and 4.5% acidity. Ingredients: fermented nipa palm sap, 
water, cloudifier. Interesting, though "cloudifier" is mentioned, it is much 
less cloudy than other Philippine vinegars that do not declare one. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Raisin Vinegar</h2> - see <a href="sours.html#grape"><b>Grape Vinegar</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h2>Rice Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Rice Wine Vinegar]
<br><img src="img/so_rice01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Rice Wine Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
In the U.S. this generally means Japanese or Japanese style white rice vinegar 
of "Industrial" quality (see also <a href="sours.html#china">Chinese Vinegars</a> for red, 
black and white versions). Rice vinegar is made by fermenting rice into beer 
which ferments into vinegar (though it's a single continuous process that 
doesn't make drinkable sake).<p>
<p>In Japan top grade rice vinegar is made in small batches in clay jars, 
but that commonly available in the U.S. is an undistinguished industrial 
product. It's good enough for many common uses and has the advantage of 
being affordable by mortals - but the photo specimen is Aged Chinese white 
rice vinegar which I much prefer (the common product is lighter in color).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Spirit Vineger</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_palm01m.jpg" alt="Glass of White Spirit Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
This product is the same thing as American "White Distilled Vinegar", 
but in Europe it is often sold at an acidity of 25%. That most available 
in North America is from Germany, sold as Essig Essenz 25%, available 
for on-line ordering and from some Central or Eastern European delis. 
Higher than 5% strength is required by some recipes for pickled herring, 
and this can be achieved by diluting the 25% with water. It is made 
from 95% (190 proof) alcohol, usually produced from sugar beets, but 
many other sources may be used, such as sugar cane, corn and other grains.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>White Distilled</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_palm01m.jpg" alt="Glass of White Distilled Vinegar" class=mrg>
<p>
This product, called "Spirit Vineger" outside North America, is made 
from alcohol (ethanol) which has been distilled to 95% (190 proof), or 
it can be produced by industrial means from ethylene gas. The USDA 
requires that any vinegar sold for human consumption be naturally 
fermented from the alcohol, but does not specify what the alcohol is 
made from (sugar beets, sugar cane, corn sugar, grains, etc.). After 
fermentation, the vinegar (acetic acid) is diluted with water, properly 
to 5% acidity. Some cheap vinegars may be 4%, the lowest allowed by 
law (and not satisfactory for most uses). It's purely an industrial 
product, but a good choice for many uses (in the water for poaching 
eggs, for instance) because of it's purity, lack of flavors other 
than acetic acid, and very low price. White Distilled Vinegar also 
finds a wide variety of household cleaning and deodorizing uses.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=wine>Wine Vinegars</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_winerw01k.jpg" alt="Glasses of Red and White Wine Vinegars" class=mrg>
As the name implies, these vinegars are 
made from wine. Naturally, they vary greatly with the quality of the wine 
used and the process. Once again we have that contrast between traditional 
(good wine and aged in oak barrels) and industrial production, and this is 
reflected in the price. High grade wine vinegars are made in Italy, Spain 
and in the wine growing regions of California. Many California wine vinegars 
are "artisanal" single varietal products so tend to be a bit upscale, 
pricewise. I've seen none from France around here. I'm sure they fetch a 
good price over on the West Side, San Francisco and New York - but I see 
WalMart sells some for around US $28 for 500ml - that's a lot more than 
most of the California vinegars.
<br class=cll>

<h3>Red &amp; White Wine Vinegar</h3>
<br>Under these names are general purpose wine vinegars for every day use. 
They vary considerably in quality, with major brand name products from 
American manufacturers generally at the bottom of the barrel, so to speak. 
Select a brand you like that you can get consistently in bottles of 
appropriate size for you usage. For general everyday use I buy L'Aretino, 
an Italian import that's pretty good at an acceptable price for both red 
and white. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Champaign, Merlot, Cabernet, etc.</h3>
<br>Single varietal wine vinegars are generally traditionally made and 
exhibit the qualities of the wines they are made from. California wine 
vinegars are predominantly of this type. They are, of course, at a higher 
price, so should be reserved for more sophisticated sauces and dressings 
where their distinctive qualities will be evident.<p></p>

<h3>Chianti Vinegar</h3> - an excellent and quite distinctive deep red 
varietal wine vinegar (at least the brands I've tried have been). It is made 
of Chianti D.O.C.G wine and is generally shipped at an acidity of around 7.5%, 
considerably higher than most wine vinegars so adjust recipes to suit.
<p></p>

<h3>Sherry Vinegar</h3>
<br><img src="img/so_sherry01m.jpg" alt="Glass of Sherry Vinegar" class=mrg>
Once this was given away by embarrassed sherry wine makers when a batch went 
bad, then somebody decided it could be sold. Now it's considered the king of 
wine vinegars, is highly prized and will carry a certificate of origin logo. 
It's also more expensive than most other wine vinegars. Like balsamic, it 
goes through a series of barrels, but that's in the wine stage. It will have 
further aging in barrels after being converted to vinegar. <b>Caution:</b> 
sherry vinegar is usually about 8% (8&deg;) acidity, considerably stronger 
than other vinegars which tend to average 4% to 5%. Adjust your recipe 
whenever substituting one for the other.
<br class=cll>

<br><hr class=hr2s>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=h1 id=other>Other Souring Agents</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id=lemon>Lemon Juice - Lime Juice</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_lemlim02e.jpg" alt="Lemon and Lime, cut" class=mrg>
Lemons and Limes provide sourness through their content of citric acid. 
Their flavors do, however, differ somewhat, so the appropriate citrus should 
be used in recipes. Limes are a tropical and subtropical fruit. Lemons are 
a subtropical and temperate fruit. Which one you should use depends on the 
climate of the cuisine's origin. Many older cookbooks specify lemon juice 
where lime juice would be more appropriate because in times past limes were 
not nearly as available in North America. Persian (Tahiti) limes and Key 
Limes are effectively the same, except you get a lot more juice out of a 
Persian.
<br class=cll>


<h2 id=citric>Citric Acid</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_citacid02k.jpg" alt="Citric Acid Crystal Powder" class=mrg>
Citric acid, in colorless crystalline form, is easily available and cheap. 
For uses were flavor is not an issue, as in the water that keeps cut 
apples and artichokes from browning (don't use it for potatoes, acid 
hardens them), it is much more convenient than actual lemons. Note that 
citric acid is much more effective than vinegar for preventing browning 
and similar uses.
<br class=cll><br>

<h2 id=mango>Amchur</h2>
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Amchur powder, Green Mango; <i>Mangifera indica</i>]
<br><img src="img/so_amchur01k.jpg" alt="Amchur (Green Mango) Powder" class=mrg>
<p>
This is a popular souring agent in India, particularly in dry regions 
where lemons and limes cannot be had. Being dry it has the advantage of 
being easily stored and transported. Called for by many recipes from 
northern India, it is very sour with a slight sweetness and just a bit 
resinous. Use it for marinades where it has the same tenderizing effect 
as lemon juice (1 teaspoon amchur powder is equivalent to 3 tablespoons 
lemon juice) and in curries. It is available both in powdered 
form as shown, and as dried chunks of mango. It is available in markets 
serving an Indian community.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=plum>Sour Plum</h2>
<br><img src="img/ro_sourplum04e.jpg" alt="Whole Sour Plums" class=mrg>
Sour plums are the sweet / sour of choice in Georgia (former 
Socialist Republic). Apparently they have purple ones there, but the sour 
plums seasonably available here in Los Angeles are green. I like to snack on 
them, crunchy and moderately juicy, sweet and sour. Dried ones, which 
are available for a longer season, are about the color of unsulfured apricots. 
<p>
Peak availability of fresh sour plums in California is in May. They are 
picked unripe, but fully hardened seed and tendency to ripen to yellow 
demonstrate these are not simply regular plums picked while still very small. 
They are typically between 1 inch and 1-1/2 inches in diameter and weigh 
about 3/4 ounce each.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id=sumac>Sumac</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_sumac01k.jpg" alt="Sumac Powder" class=mrg>
This is a very popular, but fairly mild, souring agent in the Near East, 
sold alone and as a component of herb mixes, particularly with thyme (Zatar). 
<b>Caution:</b> Don't try to make this at home. American Sumac is not the 
same variety and can cause allergic reactions and poisoning. Sumac is 
available in markets serving a Near or Middle Eastern community.
<br class=cll><br>

<div class=ts id=tam>Tamarind</div>
<br><img src="img/bp_tamar12k.jpg" alt="Forms of Tamarind" class=mrg>
Tamarind is from a large bean pod born by the Tamarind tree. The large brown 
seeds are surrounded with a sticky paste that is both sweet and sour. Though 
of African origin, it is immensely popular in India and Southeast Asia.  
It is also used in Africa, and now in Mexico and Central America as well. 
It is easily available in several forms in just about any Asian or Latin 
American market. For more information on this important tree see our 
<a href="bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><br>

<h2 id=ume>Umeboshi Vinegar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Umezu, Ume su (Japan)]
<br><img src="img/so_ume03m.jpg" alt="Glass of Ume su" class=mrg>
<p>
Technically not a vinegar, but a pink brine with a sour-fruity taste. This 
is a by-product from manufacturing Japanese pickled plums (umeboshi), 
which are themselves extremely sour. Basically, it is a nearly saturated 
solution of sea salt, made sour and given a lightly fruity flavor from 
preserving unripe plums in it. It is given a light reddish color by sisho 
(perilla) leaves. It can be used much as a vinegar would (keeping the 
high salt content in mind). It's considered good for use in salad 
dressings, and especially for flavoring steamed vegetables.</p>
<p>Umeboshi Vinegar has been adopted by the Michio Kushi Macrobiotics 
sect and by several other health food sects as a miracle health 
ingredient - if you can consider anything that salty to be healthy (1 
teaspoon contains 44% of the recommended daily value for sodium). The 
Macrobiotics people say it's very popular in Japan, a point which my 
23 Japanese cookbooks have apparently all missed, completely.

Not vinegar, but used in a similar way, verjuice is the juice of unripe 
grapes. It is essential for reconstructing Medieval and Renaissance recipes 
from before vinegar production was reliable. It used to be almost 
impossible to find in the U.S. but is now being turned out by California 
wineries.
<p>The photo specimen was made by me from unripe grapes purchased from a 
multi-ethnic market serving Anatolian, Caucasian and Near and Middle Eastern 
communities. The grapes were simply ground up in a food processor, strained 
and frozen for future use. It is very sour and somewhat fruity. &nbsp;
