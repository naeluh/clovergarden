<h1>Achiote / Annatto</h1>
<br><img src="img/sp_annatto05f.jpg" alt="Seeds and Oil" class=mrg>
[Aploppas; Achiotl (Nahuatl); Bijol; Bija (Caribbean); Recado Rojo 
  (Mexico); Atsuete (Philippines); piment&atilde;o doce (Spanish); 
  <i>Bixa orellana</i> of family <i>Bixaceae</i>]
<p>Seeds of he Achiote shrub, probably native to Brazil, have a pleasant 
but subtle aroma and flavor, but it is for their color they are most widely 
used. Aside from ethnic cuisines, the intense red-orange pigment, annatto 
(E160b), is used to color cheddar cheese, margarine, smoked fish, custard 
powder and other foods. It includes two pigments, one oil soluble 
which is more red, and one water soluble which is more yellow. The photo 
shows seeds (about 0.2 inch long) and oil extracted color.</p>
<p>The seeds are used in cooking in the Philippines, Mexico, Central 
America, the Caribbean and northeastern parts of South America. Seeds, 
Leaves and other parts are used medicinally for a number of conditions. 
Sap from the (inedible) fruits is used to treat type 2 diabetes and fungal 
infections. The red pigment has long been used by tropical American Indians 
as body paint and hair dye.</p>

<p>Both color and flavor are used in the cuisines of the Philippines, 
Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and northeastern parts of South America. 
It is also used to some extent in India and Southeast Asia. Three forms 
are used: oil extracted color, water extracted color and ground seeds.</p>

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; The whole seeds are sold in plastic 
packets in the spice section of markets serving communities as listed 
above. In a sealed jar, stored in a cool place away from light, the seeds 
will last up to a year. They slowly lose their red color and should be 
discarded when noticeably faded to brown.<p></p>

<h3>Annatto Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In a pan place 1 part Annatto seeds and 2 
parts Oil. Pure and pomace olive oil (not virgin) work well and are 
stable. Heat the oil carefully and stir continuously until the desired 
color has been reached. Be careful not get it too hot or both color and 
flavor will be destroyed. Strain and store in a tightly sealed jar where 
it will have about the same shelf life as the type of oil used.<p></p>

<h3>Annatto Water:</h3> &nbsp; In a mortar, place 1 part Annatto 
Seeds and 2 parts Water. Let soak 20 minutes. Crush the seeds to release 
more color and let soak another 10 minutes. Strain out the seeds and 
discard them.<p></p>

<h3>Atsuete:</h3> &nbsp; This is simply seeds ground to a powder. In the 
Philippines recipes often call for "1 atsuete", meaning one packet. A 
packet contains 10 grams / 1/3 ounce, the weight of 1 level tablespoon of 
seeds. Just put a tablespoon of seeds in your spice grinder and reduce to 
powder.<p></p>
