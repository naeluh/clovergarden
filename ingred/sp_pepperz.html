  [<i>Piper nigrum</i>]
<p>
Pepper originated on the Malabar (west) coast of India, but major 
plantations were later established in Indonesia for trade with the Dutch. It 
is now grown also in Brazil and several Southeast Asian countries. Pepper 
has never been popular in Indonesia despite being grown there, but has long 
been used in India and parts of Southeast Asia, particularly before chilis 
were brought from South America. In Europe it has been the most important 
spice since the Roman Empire and was extremely expensive until the 18th 
century due to trade monopolies.</p>

<p>In more recent times pepper has spread to just about every cuisine, 
particularly since the price has fallen so much and growing area has 
increased. Pepper use has increased in Southeast Asia due to it being 
grown there now, and Thailand has taken a liking to fresh green 
peppercorns. The photo specimens are: brined <b>Green Peppercorns</b>

<i>piper nigrum</i> pepper vine, just picked at different stages of 
ripeness and processed differently.</p>

<p>Few spices fade as quickly as peppercorns once ground, so you should 
always use fresh ground pepper. That can be a real hassle so I grind up 
about 2 teaspoons of black peppercorns every week and store it tightly 
capped in one of those tiny "must be useful for something" jars 
"sampler set" jams and jellies come in.</p>

<p>Pepper added to a recipe while it cooks will have a rather different 
effect than pepper applied at serving time.</p>

<p>Peppercorns of all colors are from the same <i>piper nigrum</i> pepper 
vine, just picked at different stages of ripeness and processed 
differently. Here are the main types: </p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Black Peppercorns</h3> are berries taken just before they are 
mature and sun dried with the green outer skin and flesh still 
surrounding the seed. The closer to mature at harvest the better the 
product, but the more risk, so a higher cost.</li>
<li><h3>Tillicherry pepper</h3> is the highest grade of black pepper as 
the berries are picked at the ripest point they can still be made into 
black pepper - actually Tillicherry is more a dark brown. It comes from 
Tillicherry (Tellicherry or Thalassery) on the Malabar coast of Karala 
state in India.</li>
<li><h3>White Peppercorns</h3> are fully matured red berries that are 
processed so the outer skin and flesh are rotted off. This provides the 
full pungency but little of the unique pepper flavor. White pepper is 
used in European cooking to keep white sauces pure white - considered 
important in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when "purity = white" 
was as important as "natural" is today. White peppercorns are also 
favored in China and somewhat in Southeast Asia - but I generally use 
the more flavorful black anyway.</li>
<li><h3>Green Peppercorns</h3> are a lot more herbal in flavor than black 
peppercorns. They are either fresh (available only in pepper growing 
areas), force dried, pickled, or packed in brine. Dried green peppercorns 
are the correct item to use in Western dishes like pepper steak that use 
large amounts of peppercorns.
<br>If you have a recipe asking for fresh green peppercorns and don't 
know somebody at a pepper plantation you can used brined (a decent 
substitute) or you can soak force dried green peppercorns in water to 
reconstitute them (not the same but better than none). Pickled green 
peppercorns are considered too acidic for most recipes. 
<br><u>Special Handling:</u> The brine green peppercorns are packed in 
starts turning color immediately on opening. It will be black within 
hours, even refrigerated. Remove the strings of peppercorns, rinse and 
place them in plastic bags with water to cover (to prevent freezer burn) 
and freeze.</li>
<li><h3>Red Peppercorns</h3> are fully ripe with skin on. They are only 
available pickled much beyond the pepper plantations and are very rare 
even there.</li>
<li><h3>Pink Peppercorns</h3> are not pepper at all, but seeds of a New 
World tree related to cashews and sumac. See <a href="cw_pprpz.html">
<b>Pink Peppercorns</b></a>.</li>
<li><h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> are not pepper at all but tiny seed pods 
from a Prickly Ash tree. See 
<a href="sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b></a>.</li>

</ul>
