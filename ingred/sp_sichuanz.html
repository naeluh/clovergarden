  [Szechwan Peppercorns, Flower Pepper, Prickly Ash (English); Teppal 
  (India); Jiao (China) <i>Zanthoxylum bungeanum</i>, 
  <i>Z. piperitum</i>, <i>Z. simulans</i> and others (citrus family)]
<p>
These "peppercorns" are dried fruits of prickly ash trees. They are 
essential to the famous Sichuan cuisine of China and are used in other 
cuisines. The Chinese variety come in red (left in photo) and green 
(right in photo), but the green are still very rare here in North America 
(2020). The two are very similar, though the green has a touch of lime 
peel flavor and may be just a little stronger. Its use only started in 
Sichuan in 1998, and it is now favored for river fish, eels and rabbit.
</p>  
<p>The empty seed pods are used, the seeds themselves are hard, have 
little flavor, and are discarded. These pods are quite unique with a 
remarkably sharp, citrusy flavor and a numbing anesthetic effect on the 
tongue. Other countries, particularly Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet, use 
related species with flavors that vary more or less from the Chinese. 
Some of these are listed below.</p>

Sichuan Peppercorns were banned in the U.S. from 1968 to 2005 as a 
possible carrier of citrus canker, but real enforcement didn't start 
until 2002 - then supplies started to dry up. They are now legally 
available again and in good supply. Current regulations require heating 
the peppercorns to 160&deg;F/70&deg;C after which they will be somewhat 
less red in color. There has been debate about how much this affects the 
flavor, but Sichuan recipes generally call for them to be toasted before 
use anyway, so this debate seems irrelevant.</p>

<p>The empty fruit shells are much used in Sichuan China and in the 
Himalayan region (Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan). In Japan, young leaves are 
also used as a flavoring for fish, soups, and vegetables. In general 
the fruits are dry roasted and then ground before adding to the recipe, 
usually near the end of cooking.</p>

<p><u>Subst</u>: There is no real substitute, but if you can't get them 
use this formula: Grind together 1/2 t black peppercorns 
and 2 t coriander seeds. Add grated zest of 2/3 lemon (yellow only). This 
will fill in for about an equal measure of whole sichuan peppercorns. While 
it lacks the important numbing effect it will fill in for the flavor.

<h2>Varieties</h2>

<p><b>China:</b> &nbsp; Shanjiao, Jaio, Fajiu (Canton) 
(<i>Z. bungeanum</i>, <i>Z. simulans</i>), are used mostly in Sichuan 
provence but also feature in Five Spice Powder, used throughout 
China and Southeast Asia.</p>
  
<p><b>Nepal:</b>  &nbsp; Timur (<i>Z. alatum</i>) is a species important 
to the cooking of Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It's flavor differs a bit 
from the Chinese in being less citrusy and more spicy, but it's pretty 
much unavailable in North America, so use Chinese.</p>

<p><b>Korea:</b>  &nbsp; Sancho (<i>Z. schinifolium</i>) is used in 
Korea. It is smaller than Chinese, green in color and has little 
pungency. Koreans also use Chopi (<i>Z. piperitum</i> - see Japan).</p>

<p><b>Japan:</b>  &nbsp; Milder species are used in Japan, particularly 
Sansho (<i>Z. piperitum</i> syn. <i>Z. sansho</i>). Young leaves 
(kinomie) are also used as garnish for fish and as a flavoring in soups. 
They are said to have a flavor somewhere between lime and mint. They 
are also crushed with miso, then used in salads and with seafood and 
vegetables. Green berries are often steeped in soy sauce and used with 
fish. Inuzansho (Dog Sansho; <i>Z. schinifolium</i>) is also used.</p>

<b>India:</b>  &nbsp; (photo to the left) Tirphal, Teppal, Tilfda, 
Tippal, Tirphul (<i>Z. rhetsa</i>), is much larger than other species, 
and green in color. It has much less of the tongue numbing effect than 
the Sichuan species.</p>

<p><b>Indonesia:</b>  &nbsp; Andaliman (<i>Z. acanthopodium</i>) is 
smaller than the others and often sold as clusters. It is less pungent 
than the Chinese and very citrusy.</p>

<p><b>Tibet:</b>  &nbsp; g.yer ma (<i>Z. alatum</i>) is one of the few 
spices available in the Himalayan region. It is used with yak meat and 
yak innards.</p>

<p><b>U.S.</b>  &nbsp; Prickly ash (<i>Z. americanum</i>) has not been 
used as a seasoning but its anaesthetic properties have been applied in 
toothache potions.  
&nbsp; <b>U.S.</b>  &nbsp; Fagara (<i>Z. bungeanum</i>) an obsolete 
market name for Sichuan peppercorns, apparently a corruption of the 
Cantonese Fajiu. Most Chinese immigrants in the 19th to the mid 20th 
centuries were from the Canton region.</p>
