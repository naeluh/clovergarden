<h2 class=lrg id="gen">History</h2>

<p>Most of our well known spices are grown in tropical coastal regions of 
India and Southeast Asia, but a few are from the tropics of the 
Americas. From ancient times, spices have been a major article of trade to 
Europe and the Mediterranean region. The trade was long controlled by 
Arab and Venetian monopolies, making spices absurdly expensive.</p>

<p>Medieval recipes call for many spices but fail to give any quantities. 
These recipes were written for professional cooks who learned how much in 
their apprenticeship. Many writers presume these spices were used with a 
heavy hand. Others say the many spices may have been used judiciously in 
sophisticated mixes, as it is done in India. Unfortunately, amounts 
recorded in trade records, divided by the number of people who 
could actually afford spices, indicates a heavy hand.</p>

<p>Many writers claim that the heavy hand with spices was to hide the 
taint of spoiled meats. This is certainly false. Given the very detailed 
instructions to staff on daily shopping that have come down to us, it is 
clear those who could afford spices were not eating spoiled meat - and 
those who had to eat spoiled meat could not afford spices that cost more 
than the meat.</p>

<p>The reason spices were used with a heavy hand is simple. They were very 
costly, so using lots of spices was a display of wealth and prestige.
<p>

<p>The high cost of spices was a major factor in European development of 
the highly sophisticated sailing ship technology that made world conquest 
and the colonial era possible. Ironically, these ships were so efficient 
and so effective at breaking the trade monopolies, the cost of spices 
plunged. As costs plunged, so did usage - they were no longer a display 
of wealth when everyone could afford them. Today, most European countries 
use few spices, and little of those they do use. The only one still 
costly is labor intensive saffron.</p>

<p>Today, every time our government is thrown out of a country it invaded 
or has been meddling in, all the collaborators move to Los Angeles and 
many open restaurants. Naturally, they send home for ingredients as soon 
as they can. Specialty markets are soon opened and new crops are planted 
on farms. The happy result is that nearly every spice used in the world 
is available here in Southern California.</p> 

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="work">Working <small>with</small> Spices</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Buying Storing &amp; Preparing Spices</h3>
<br>The most important factor in successful spice usage is freshness. Flavor 
depends on oils which will evaporate and/or turn rancid in time. This process 
is accelerated by many times when the spice is ground.

<p><img src="img/ke_spicegrind01.jpg" alt="Grinder" width="120" height="183" class=mrg>
The best place to buy spices is from an ethnic grocer or importer who 
services a large community that uses those spices. Supermarket spices 
may have been years getting to you. Comparing ground turmeric from your 
local supermarket with that from an Indian market will be a revelation.
</p>
<p>Since ground spices degrade so rapidly it is better to buy them whole 
and grind as needed.A small whirling blade coffee grinder does a remarkable 
job of grinding spices in just seconds. Gun it a few times, then turn it 
upside down and whack it with the palm of your hand to shake the spice into 
the lid.</p>

<p>Store spices, whole or ground, in tightly sealed containers in a cool 
dark place. Direct sunlight is very destructive to spices. Buy in quantities 
that will be used up in about a year for whole spices, 6 months or less for 
ground.</p>

<p>Black pepper declines very rapidly after grinding but is used so 
frequently I don't want to grind it every time. I grind a tablespoon or 
so every week and keep it in one of those ultra-tiny "must be good for 
something" gift basket jam jars, to be spooned out as needed.</p>

<h3>Roasting Spices</h3>
<br><img src="img/ke_tavalodge1.jpg" alt="Pans" width="200" height="131" class=mrg>
Particularly in India and Southeast Asia, but also in North Africa and 
other regions, spices are prepared for grinding into spice mixtures by 
dry roasting. The Indian <i>tava</i> (also used for making flatbread) 
is the traditional pan for this. It is slightly concave and works great 
on a clay stove or over a bucket of charcoal, but it doesn't work on our 
gas burners or electric elements. The absolutely perfect pan to use is 
the Lodge L90G3 10" round griddle. Both items are shown in the photo, 
though our wood handled tava is a bit "upscale" compared to the pounded 
disk of sheet iron you'd find in an average Indian household.

<p>When roasting spices, do them one at a time because their timing is 
so different. Of course, in India, experienced cooks know the order and 
timing by which to add them to the pan so they are all done at once, 
but you probably don't have that level of experience.</p>
<p> Heat them over high heat stirring and shaking the pan frequently 
until they start releasing their characteristic fragrance and start to 
darken just a touch, then pour them out onto a plate to cool well before 
grinding. I always start with cumin since it is so distinctive it'll let 
me know when the pan is hot enough for the others. I also do all this 
before handling dried chilis or I may not be able to smell anything at 
all.

<h2 class=lrg id="dry">Dried Spices</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id=annatt>Achiote / Annatto</h2>
<br><a href="sp_annattz.html">
<img src="img/sp_annatto05h.jpg" alt="Seeds and Oil" width="220" height="178" class=mrg></a>
[Bijol; Bija (Caribbean); recado rojo (Mexico); Atsuete (Philippines) 
Piment&atilde;o doce (Spanish); <i>Bixa orellana</i>]
<p>Seeds of he Achiote shrub, probably native to Brazil, have a pleasant 
but subtle aroma and flavor, but it is for their color they are most widely 
used. Aside from ethnic cuisines, the intense red-orange pigment, annatto 
(E160b), is used to color cheddar cheese, margarine, smoked fish, custard 
powder and other foods. It includes two pigments, one oil soluble 
which is more red, and one water soluble which is more yellow. The photo 
shows seeds (about 0.2 inch long) and oil extracted color.</p>
<p>The seeds are used in cooking in the Philippines, Mexico, Central 
America, the Caribbean and northeastern parts of South America. Seeds, 
Leaves and other parts are used medicinally for a number of conditions. 
Sap from the (inedible) fruits is used to treat type 2 diabetes and fungal 
infections. The red pigment has long been used by tropical American Indians 
as body paint and hair dye.

<h2 id="ajwain">Ajwain</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_ajwan02h.jpg" alt="Fruits containing seeds" width="240" height="163" class=mrg>
[Ajowan, Carom seed, Bishop's weed, Ajowan caraway; Vaamu (Telugu - India), 
Omam (Tamil - India); Nech azmud (Ethiopia); <i>Trachyspermum ammi</i>]
<p>This member of the Parsley family is native to India, Pakistan 
and the Near East, and is used as a spice through the region. It has a 
flavor much like thyme, because, like thyme, it contains thymol. It is 
stronger than thyme and needs to be used with discretion. In India it is 
considered helpful to digestion, and often included in dishes thought 
hard to digest. The part used is the dried fruits, which contain the 
seeds. The photo specimens (whole fruits) were quite small, typically 
0.122 inch long by 0.033 inch wide (3.0 x 0.8 mm).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="allsp">Allspice</h2>
<br><img src="img/my_allsp02h.jpg" alt="Fruits containing seeds" width="240" height="175" class=mrg>
[Jamaica pepper, Myrtle pepper; Pimenta, Pimento (Spanish); English pepper 
(Hebrew); <i>Pimenta dioica</i> of family <i>Myrtaceae</i>]
<p>Native to the Caribbean, southern Mexico and Central America, this spice 
is produced by a tree that can grow to 60 feet tall. The name comes from 
the English, who thought the dried fruits tasted like a combination of 
cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. The tree has now been planted in tropical 
climates around the world. Allspice is very important in Caribbean 
cuisine, and has been enthusiastically adopted in the Levant. In Germany 
it is used in sausages.</p>
<p> This spice should always be bought as whole dried fruits, as it declines 
rapidly if ground. It is soft and easily ground. In the growing region the 
leaves are also used as a flavoring, but they become worthless when dried, 
so are not a commercial item. The photo specimens vary considerably in size, 
with the largest 0.330 inch diameter and the smallest 0.227 inch diameter 
(8.4 to 5.8 mm).
<br class=cll></p>

  

<h2 id="mango">Amchur</h2>
<br><img src="img/so_amchur01k.jpg" alt="Powder" width="200" height="139" class=mrg>
[Amchur powder, Green Mango; <i>Mangifera indica</i>]
<p>This is a popular souring agent in India, particularly in dry regions 
where lemons and limes cannot be had. Being dry it has the advantage of 
being easily stored and transported. Called for by many recipes from 
northern India, it is very sour with a slight sweetness and just a bit 
resinous. Use it for marinades where it has the same tenderizing effect 
as lemon juice (1 teaspoon amchur powder is equivalent to 3 tablespoons 
lemon juice) and in curries. It is available both in powdered 
form as shown, and as dried chunks of mango. It is available in markets 
serving an Indian community.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="anise">Anise</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_anises01h.jpg" alt="Seeds" width="220" height="144" class=mrg>
[Nketenkete, Osukone (Ghana); <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>]
<p>The fruits of this potent member of the parsley family are used to 
provide a "licorice" flavor to many drinks and candies, though it is 
unrelated to the root from which "true licorice" is obtained. In the U.S. 
anise is used mostly in cookies and other baked goods while the related 
but less "licoricy" fennel fruits are used more for cooking.</p>
<p>The bulbs and fronds sold as "Anise" or "Sweet Anise" in the groceries 
are actually <a href="py_fennz.html"><b>Fennel</b></a>. See also 
<a href="sp_staraz.html"><b>Star Anise</b></a> for another unrelated spice 
with a similar flavor. Anise fades rapidly if ground so you should keep 
whole "seeds" (actually a dried fruit) and grind them as needed.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Asafoetida</h2>
<br><a href="py_asafoz.html">
<img src="img/py_asafo01h.jpg" alt="Powdered resin" width="220" height="194" class=mrg></a>
[Hing (india), <i>Ferula assa-foetida</i> (Parsley family)]
<p>Dried sap from roots of this parsley family herb native to Central Asia 
was used in Europe from the time Alexander until the 16th century. It was 
important in Roman cuisine as a substitute for 
<a href="py_silphz.html">Silphium</a> which was very expensive. It is still much used in India, particularly as 
a substitute for onions and garlic by Indian Brahmins for whom those are 
forbidden. The flavor is not the same but it adds a similar sophistication.
Asafoetida is used mainly with vegetable dishes but it can also add an 
interesting flavor to meat.</p>
<p>Food writers have struggled to describe the foul smell of the raw resin - 
struggled because food writers aren't familiar with SAE 90W hypoid gear 
oil which contains similar sulphur compounds. Fortunately the odor is 
subdued by cooking. This product is sold in two versions, pure resin (which 
may be in powdered form) and Hing powder, which has powdered resin cut with 
rice flour and other substances. I strongly recommend the pure resin.</p>
<p>Asafoetida resin <u>must</u> be fried in hot oil briefly before other 
ingredients are added to the pan. For pure resin powder this is just a couple 
of seconds but will be a little more for coarser resin. Hing powder is 
supposed to not need this step but I disagree.

<h2 id="ataik">Ataiko</h2>
<br><img src="img/gg_ataiko02h.jpg" alt="Ataiko Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Otaiko, Atariko, Rohojie, Rohoji, Rigije, Orima; <i>Aframomum subsericeum</i> 
<p>Native to Nigeria and Cameroon, and south into D.R. Congo, this plant is 
of the Ginger family. Its seeds are used as a spice in soups in Nigeria, 
particularly Banga (Palm) and Pepper soups. These seeds taste similar to 
Green Cardamom seeds but the flavor is not as bright. The photo specimens 
were about 0.075 inch diameter and 0.210 inch long (2 x 5.3 mm). They were 
purchased from a US vendor of West African foods for 2021 US $4.87 per ounce.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Calabash Nutmeg / Ehuru</h2>

<p>The seeds of this plant were once used as a low cost substitute for 
Nutmeg, but use has greatly declined because the price difference is 
now the other way around, except for where it grows, mainly West Africa.

<h2 id="caraw">Caraway</h2>
<br><img src="img/py_caraways01h.jpg" alt="Seeds" width="220" height="147" class=mrg>
[<i>Anethum graveolens</i>]
<p>Native to western Asia and Europe the dried fruits of this plant are 
used mostly in the cuisines of Central and Northern Europe to flavor bread, 
sauerkraut, cheeses, liquors, casseroles and other foods. They also have a 
long history of medicinal use. The roots may be cooked as a root vegetable 
but are not grown commercially for that purpose.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Caraway, Black</h2>
<br>This name generally refers to <a href="rn_nigelaz.html"><b>Nigella</b></a>

<h2>Cardamom - Green</h2>
<br><a href="gg_cardomz.html">
<img src="img/gg_cardgrn07e.jpg" alt="Green Cardamom Pods and Seeds" width="260" height="170" class=mrg></a>
[White Cardamom, True Cardamom; Elaichi (India); Hel (Persia, Hebrew); 
Hayl (Arabic); <i>Elettaria cardamomum</i> (Ginger Family)]
<p>Green Cardamom is native to India and Malaysia. India produces nearly the 
entire world's commercial supply (and consumes most of it). The seeds are 
highly aromatic with a sharp brilliant flavor.  White cardamom is green that 
has been bleached. This is the cardamom to use whenever black is not 
specifically called for by name or region. It is the cardamom commonly 
available in Europe and North America and used in sweets, coffee and tea 
in the Arabic regions, Persia and India.

[Black Cardamom, Brown Cardamom; Kali Elaichi, Moti Elaichi (India); 
th&aacute;o qu&aacute; (Vietnam); <i>Amomum subulatum</i> (India), 
<i>Amonum costatum</i> (China) (Ginger family)]
<p>Black Cardamom is not interchangeable with green cardamom. While the green 
is sharp and brilliant the black is dark and smoky with high tones of 
camphor and mint. It is the cardamom used in China and Vietnam, and in India 
it is often included in Garam Masala mixes and certain curries, particularly 
in the northern regions.

<h2>Cassia Bark</h2>
<br>[<i>Cinnamomum cassia (aromaticum)</i>]
<br>An aromatic bark largely interchangeable with (and often confused 
with) Cinnamon. Cassia is used in China, Southeast Asia and the United 
States, Cinnamon most other places. See our 
<a href="ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon</b></a> page for details and 
how to tell them apart.<p></p>

<h2>Celery Seed</h2>
<br><a href="py_celseedz.html">
<img src="img/py_celseed02h.jpg" alt="Seeds" width="240" height="154" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Apium graveolens</i> var <i>graveolens</i>]
<p>Another aromatic seed from the parsley family, Celery Seed (actually very 
tiny fruits) is produced from "Wild Celery" rather than the common Pascal 
variety. Much of what is sold as "celery seed" is mixed with or even entirely 
<a href="py_lovagez.html">Lovage Seed</a>. Apparently lovage is a better 
seed producer, but is very closely related to and very similar to wild 
celery. Celery seed has been used for thousands of years, both as a flavoring 
spice and for its medicianal properties.  For details see our 
<a href="py_celseedz.html"><b>Celery Seed</b></a> page.

[genus <i>Capsicum</i>, 30 or more species]
<p>An important and prolific member of the Nightshade family (<i>Solanaceae</i>),
chilis produce varieties of fruit that are used as spices, fresh or dried, 
and others that are used as vegetables. Originating in Central and South 
America, they were spread throughout the world by European traders and are 
now essential to many cuisines. They are so diverse and so important we 
have a separate (and rather extensive) <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">

<h2>Cinnamon</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [<i>Cinnamonum verum (zeylanicum)</i>]
<br><h2>Cassia Bark</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [<i>Cinnamomum cassia

<br><a href="ll_cinnz.html">
<img src="img/ll_cinnamon01c.jpg" alt="Cinnamon and Cssia Bark" width="211" height="140" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and the Malabar coast of India, 
but now grown also in the West Indies and South America. Cassia is native to 
Burma and is grown in China, Vietnam and Indonesia, with Vietnamese 
(<i>Cinnamomum loureiroi</i>) considered the highest quality. The 
aromatic bark of both these trees is peeled and dried for use as a spice. 
The two are easily confused but pretty much interchangeable in recipes.</p>
<p>Shown are long Cinnamon sticks (top), standard U.S. Cassia sticks (center), 
broken Cinnamon common in Indian groceries (right) and ground Cinnamon/Cassia 
(left). Preference for and availability of these spices is a mater of region. 
Cassia predominates in the U.S. but Cinnamon predominates in Mexico. 
Cassia is difficult to find in Europe where Cinnamon predominates. China 
and Southeast Asia use Cassia almost exclusively, but Cinnamon is used in 
India and Sri Lanka. Cinnamon generally has a cleaner, sweeter flavor 
and Cassia has a touch of bitterness.

[Laung (hindi);  Nelke (German); Kanafuru (Hausa); <i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>]
<p>Cloves are flower buds of a myrtle family tree native to Indonesia. To 
maximize quality they must be harvested just before opening into flowers, 
and then immediately dried. Cloves have been in great demand in Europe since 
the Roman Empire and were very expensive considering they had to come all the 
way from Indonesia. They were not grown elsewhere until recently. Despite 
demand abroad, cloves have never been an important spice in Indonesia, 
where the major use is in cigarettes.

<p>These "seeds" are actually dried fruits containing the seeds. While not 
now used in Europe to anywhere near the extent they were in Medieval times, 
coriander seeds are still used in pickling and sausage making. In India they 
are used in vast quantity for all manner of curries and spice mixtures, 
almost always with Cumin at a ratio of about 1 T Coriander to 1 t cumin. 
This combination was also popular in Imperial Rome and is used in Africa 
and the Middle East. Coriander seeds from India are larger and lighter than 
those from Europe. Coriander greens, known here as Cilantro, are also a major 
food flavoring. The photo specimens, from India, were typically 0.140 inch

<p>Cumin is another member of the aromatic parsley family. What are called 
"cumin seeds" are actually the dried fruit, and they contain the seeds.
<br><b>White Cumin</b> is the regular cumin. The term "white" is 
sometimes used in India to specifically differentiate it from Black 
Cumin. The photo specimens were typically 0.188 inch long by 0.060 inch 
wide (4.8 x 1.5 mm). For details see our <a href="py_cuminz.html">
<b>Cumin</b></a> page.
<br><b>Black Cumin</b> &nbsp; [Kala Jeera] &nbsp; is a cumin relative 
(different genus) used for some particular spicings in northern India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Iran. The seeds are 
much smaller than white cumin and the flavor much more aromatic (and the 
cost much higher). These seeds are generally not ground. Substituting 
with White Cumin is distinctly imperfect. The photo specimens were 
typically 0.220 inch long by 0.020 wide (5.6 x 0.5 mm). For details

<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> (Parsley family)]
<p>
Native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, Fennel is unusual 
in being used not only a spice (dried fruits) and as an herb (leaves) 
but also as a vegetable (swollen stem bases). It grows easily 
in any temperate climate and is grown throughout the world, often 
becoming a weed. The yellow-beige fruits (left in photo) are now used 
as a dried spice through most of the world, especially for flavoring 
fish and meat, soups, sweets, drinks and curries. The fruits are similar 
to  <a href="spices.html#anise"><b>Anise</b></a> but notably sweeter. 
The variety of fennel used for spice is not the same variety used as a 
vegetable but they are closely related. The photo specimens were typically 
0.285 inch long by 0.080 inch wide (7.2 x 2 mm). &nbsp;

<p><b>Lucknow Fennel</b>, to the right in the photo, is a variety grown in 
northern India. It has much smaller seeds with an even sweeter more 
aromatic licorice flavor. This fennel is called for in many dishes 
originating in northern India and can be found in Indian markets (at a 
much higher price than regular fennel). The photo specimens were 
typically 0.233 inch long by 0.063 inch wide (5.9 x 1.6 mm).</p>

<p>This bitter aromatic bean, tiny and angular compared to common beans, 
is used extensively in India, where it is generally roasted to bring out 
the flavors before grinding for spice mixes like garam masala. It is 
also used in Greece, the Near East, Persia and Southeast Asia.
Fenugreek Leaves are also used as a slightly bitter fresh herb in the 
cooking of Persia, parts of India and the Near East, and as a dried 
herb in Georgia. In North America, seeds are used as a flavoring to make 
imitation maple syrup. The photo specimens were typically 0.170 inch 
long by 0.105 inch wide (4.3 x 2.7 mm).

<p>This plant is grown widely in South and Southeast Asia, including 
Indonesia. Its highly aromatic seeds are use in curries, and in some 
parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh replace mustard seed in the Bengali 
spice mix Panch Phoron. It smells similar to parsley seed, but must be 
used with considerable discretion as it is very strong and can overpower 
a dish. The seeds are generally fried in oil until aromatic and crackling 
before adding other ingredients. The herb can also be used fresh and is 
reported to be so used in Thailand. The photo specimens, purchased from 
an export house in India at US $9.99 / 100 gms (3.5 ounces) were about 
0.040 inch diameter.

[<i>Crocus sativus</i>]
<p>
The only plant in the Iris family of culinary importance, the Saffron 
Crocus, does not appear in nature - it is sterile, so must have been 
the result of human intervention. It may have originated in Bronze 
Age-Crete, but is now harvested as a crop from Spain through India 
and North Africa. The only part of the plant with culinary use is the 
stigmas, thread like components of the flower. These are used as a 
flavoring and coloring in many cuisines. They must be dried, causing 
chemical changes, before they are effective.</p>

<p>It takes 150 flowers to make 1 gram (0.035 ounce), which is about 
1/2 tablespoon of very loosely packed threads. These threads must be 
carefully harvested by hand. In North America, a single gram can cost 
between US $2.00 and $16.00, depending on size of the package, grade 
of saffron, point of origin and what the retailer thinks he can get 
from his customers. The photo to the left shows 1 gram of Spanish 
saffron, with our ubiquitous red kidney bean for size comparison.

purposes as those peppers, but is much more aromatic. It is native to 
much of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal across to Ethiopia, and as 
far south as Tanzania, with Ghana the largest producer. It is thought 
to have originated in Ethiopia, but is particularly important in 
Senegal on the coast of West Africa.

<p>This plant is native to both India and Africa, with many wild relatives 
in both regions. It is now grown through much of the tropics for its 
seeds, used both as a spice and a source of cooking oil. Burma is the 
largest producer, but India is the largest exporter, and Japan the 
largest importer. Sesame is not much grown in the United States due 
to the labor cost in harvesting, though this is being worked on.</p>
<p>There are thousands of varieties of this plant, producing seeds in 
many colors, but the most commonly available in North America are White 
and Black. The brown seeds in the center of the photo are white seeds 
that have been toasted, a very common way sesame seeds are used. White 
seeds dominate in India, and black in China and Southeast Asia, so 
naturally the color used in those regions matches the color grown.</p>
<p>In Europe and North America, sesame seeds are much used as toppings 
for baked goods, including hamburger buns (McDonalds buys 75% of Mexico's 
crop). In other regions, usage is much more diverse, including many 
sweets like halva, and also tahini (like peanut butter, but sesame).

and desertification. While the leaves were sometimes used as an herb and 
stalks as a vegetable the main use was for drops of dried resin obtained 
by slashing the roots or stalks. This resin was highly prized and very 
expensive, but the only similar product available today is 
<a href="py_asafoz.html">Asafoetida</a> which was considered inferior

<p>An essential for Chinese cooking, this spice is also grown and used in 
Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, and India. These licorice flavored seed pods 
grow on a tree native to Vietnam and southern China. The hard seeds which 
may be present in the pods can be ground with the pods or discarded - 
they lack flavor. Star Anise is almost always sold as whole or broken 
pods to be used whole or ground just before use. In the West it is used 
as a flavoring in a number of alcoholic beverages. In the early 2000s, 
most of the harvest went to processors for extraction of a chemical used 
in manufacturing the drug Tamiflu&reg; This tree belongs to the Basal

<p>This powder is ground from steamed and dried turmeric roots. The dried 
powder is commonly used in India, and is ground weekly from dried roots 
whenever possible. The North American spice trade considers Turmeric nothing 
more than a coloring, so the dried powder is likely old with inferior flavor 
and no aroma. That found in Indian markets has far better flavor and aroma 
because both turnover and expectations are much higher.

<p>Vanilla beans are long seed pods containing thousands of seeds, but the 
seeds are of no importance. The pods are picked green and then killed, 
usually by heat or sun drying. They are then fermented for 7 to 10 days 
at high temperature and humidity allowing enzymes to convert substances 
in the beans into vanillin and something like 200  other flavoring 
components. The beans are then dried and sorted by quality. &nbsp;

[mostly powdered horseradish <i>B. Armoracia rusticana</i>, not actual

<p>The one thing you should not expect in "Wasabe Powder", is a detectable  
amount of wasabe root. It's nearly all powdered horseradish, with a little 
green coloring - because powdered wasabe root is pretty much worthless (and 
very expensive). This powder is almost flavorless dry. It is mixed with 
enough water to make a paste, then allowed to sit for 10 minutes or so until 
enzymes have produced the pungency. It should be used within an hour or less 
because the pungency fades rather quickly.</p>
<p>The photo specimen, From Japan, is not as garishly green as 
some. It lists as ingredients: Horseradish, Japanese wasabe root, 
gardenia. The gardenia is, no doubt, for the green color, and the 
wasabe root is probably just enough to list ahead of the gardenia. 
These powders can claim to be Wasabe whether or not they contain any 
wasabe root, because Wasabe is also the word for horseradish in Japan.

   wood hard.  Galangal is more earthy, with flavors of citrus, pine and 
   camphor.</p>
   <p>Fresh root is increasingly available in the US, with some now grown

nearly so bright a green as the fake. It's also very expensive and the 
flavor is extremely perishable.</p>

<p>Imported "wasabi" purchased as tiny cans of dried powder or tubes

horseradish under the name "wasabi" because the Japanese name for

<h2 class=lrg id="health">Health Considerations</h2>

<p>In general, the quantity of spices used in everyday cooking is not 
sufficient to have either a positive or negative effect on health. On 
the other hand, extracts of many spices are highly medicinal, and a few 
are toxic. Some spices, particularly nutmeg, which are harmless to 
people can be deadly to dogs, cats and other animals.</p>
