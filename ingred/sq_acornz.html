This popular winter squash is available year round throughout North America. 
It's Generally a very dark green with an orange patch where it rested on the 
ground (#4750) but White (#4752) and Gold (#4751) varieties are also 
recognized. See also the Carnival Squash which is 
basically a highly colorful acorn squash. This squash is popular for baking, 
stuffing and soup, but don't overcook or it can become mushy. The green 
photo specimen was 4-5/8 inches in diameter and weighed 1-1/2 pounds.

<p><b>Buy:</b> &nbsp; Best from July through November, squash should be hard, heavy 
for their size and under 3 pounds (larger may be stringy). The skin should be 
very dark green and there will be a patch of orange on one side (orange 
mottling indicates age). Skin should be smooth and silky but not shiny which 
indicates picked unripe and there should be no soft spots whatever.</p>

<p><b>Cook:</b> &nbsp; Cut in half lengthwise and remove seeds and strings. 
If you are not strong you may need a large knife or Chinese cleaver knife you 
can drive in with a soft face hammer. <i>Cooks Illustrated</i> recommends 
microwaving for about 20 minutes at high power - otherwise, bake cut side 
up at 400&deg;F/200&deg;C until soft through - generally about 1 hour 15 
minutes. Steaming and boiling are necessary for some recipes but must be 
done with care to minimize damage to flavor and texture.</p>

<p><b>Store:</b> &nbsp; Do not refrigerate. It will keep up to a month in a cool 
dark place. Once cut it must be refrigerated and used quickly.</p>
