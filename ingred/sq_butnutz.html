<p>
This medium size (2 to 5 pounds) bottle shaped winter squash 
has very sweet orange flesh. The flavor is described as somewhat like 
sweet potato, and it can substitute for sweet potato in recipes. It's 
one of the most widely available squash in North America, appearing in 
most produce markets and supermarkets all year. </p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Butternut squash is widely available at 
supermarkets and vegetable stands throughout North America most of 
the year. Select squash heavy for its size and without any soft spots 
or bruises. The more orange the flesh, the riper it is.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Do not refrigerate. They'll keep in a cool dry 
place for a month or so. Once cut they should be refrigerated and used 
within a few days.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> As with most winter squash, the most common ways of 
cooking are roasting and in soup, but butternut, due to its sweetness 
and availability, is used in a larger range of recipes than other winter 
squash, especially since it can substitute for sweet potato.

<p>This squash is often simply split lengthwise, the seeds scooped 
out, lightly oiled, and roasted in a 400&deg;F/200&deg;C oven, on 
foil, cut side down, for about 45 minutes or until soft. It may also 
be peeled, cut into chunks, tumbled with oil and perhaps spices, and 
roasted 25 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks.
