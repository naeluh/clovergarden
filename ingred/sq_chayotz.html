<p>
Pronounced chy-O-tay, this vegetable is technically not a squash because 
it belongs to genus <i>C. Sechium</i> not <i>C. Cucurbita</i>, but it's 
normally called a squash. An odd squash it is - it looks like a giant 
seed. Each "squash" consists of a very large embryo within a smooth but 
very soft and thin seed coat, and a thick layer of flesh over that. A 
notch is left at the wide end through which the seed sprouts. Native to 
Central America, chayotes are now grown worldwide. they are  quite 
popular in India and Southeast Asia, but the two biggest exporters are 
Costa Rica (mostly to Europe) and Veracruz Mexico (mostly to the U.S.).
</p>
<p>The photo shows two regular Chayotes, which average about 3 inches 
across, 4-3/4 inches long and weight about 9 ounces each. There is also a 
smaller rounder variety with a dark green skin that has better flavor but 
is very rarely seen here. There are also yellow varieties (Perulero) 
and very dark green ones (Guisquil) grown in Guatemala. The big 2 
pound spiky chayote in the back has excellent flavor, but you won't see 
them in most regions. Grocery people hate them because they'll stab you 
right through bags and lightweight gloves. Food writers have been 
endlessly puzzled by early reports that the chayote was "like a 
porcupine" because they were unaware of this variety. There are also 
a lot of small spiky varieties which are not in the commercial market.

<h2>White Chayote</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_chayow05f.jpg" alt="Whole, Cut White Chayote" class=mrg>
[Perulero, Yellow Chayote; <i>Sechium edule</i>]
<p>
This variety started showing up at a large Latino market here in Los 
Angeles (Burbank) in 2014, selling as Perulero at a premium price of 
$2.14 / pound. The name Perulero  means "from Peru", but these are 
mostly grown in Guatemala, probably near the town of El Perulero. 
Their flavor is mild, but very similar to the regular light green ones. 
The photo specimens, grown in the USA, were from the same market 
in 2017, for US $0.99 / pound. The one to the left in the photo was 
4.4 inches long, 3.8 inches wide and weighed 1 pound 5/8 
ounce. 

<br class=cll></p><hr class=hr2>

<p>The flavor of chayote fruit is often described as a blend of zucchini, 
green bean and cucumber, which is fairly accurate. The flesh is starchy 
and stays reasonably firm when cooked. Chayote is rich in vitamins C and 
B6, folate, potassium, magnesium and fiber.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Chayotes are available in all markets serving 
Latin American communities and often in markets serving Southeast Asian 
or Indian communities. Look for smooth fresh appearance and no bruises, 
soft spots or discoloration. If you can find a variety with dark green 
skin it will probably be more flavorful but the light green variety 
dominates the markets. The big spiky variety is available in some 
markets that serve a Central American community.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; They'll keep a few days at room temperature 
or about a week refrigerated. They need fairly high humidity so they 
won't shrivel.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If your chayotes are mature with thick skins you 
need to peel them, The toughest skins are easy to remove after cooking, 
and very young chayotes with tender skins can be eaten skin-on. In the 
middle are most of them, the ones with skins too tough to eat but too 
tender to pull off easily.

<p>Most of the skin can be removed with a vegetable peeler, but that in 
deep grooves needs to be cut out with a sharp knife. once you have split 
the Chayote in half lengthwise on the seam, it is easy to take a 
diagonal slice off the big end to remove the skin there (see top photo 
bottom right).</p>

<p>I've often read that if you peel them raw they exude a sticky 
substance that's difficult to wash off your hands. I've peeled plenty 
of fresh Chayotes with a vegetable peeler, but have failed to experience 
this substance.</p>

<p>Inside are two large embryonic leaves (cotyledon). If these are 
large, they are a tasty morsel with a lightly nutty flavor, generally 
eaten by the cook as soon as the chayotes are done, and seldom getting 
to the table. The seed coat that surrounds the embryo is soft so need 
not be removed.</p>

<h3>Prickly Chayotes:</h3> &nbsp; First you want to disarm them by 
blasting them with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane 
Torch</b></a>. They'll still have some stubble but won't stab you. 
The vegetable peeler is useless, you have to carve the skin off with 
a sharp vegetable knife.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Chayote chunks or slices can be put into soups 
and stews raw if simmering time will be at least 20 minutes. Otherwise, 
steam or simmer until done, about 20 to 25 minutes, and add to the 
recipe when it is almost done.

<p>Chayote is sometimes grated or sliced into thin strips and added to 
salads raw, but they are most often cut into cubes or slices and cooked, 
even if they will appear on a raw salad plate. They are popular this way 
in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2 id="green">Chayote Greens</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_chayo03g.jpg" alt="Fronds of Chayote Greens" class=mrg>
[pucuk labu (Malay); Long xu cai, Dragon Whiskers Vegetable (Chinese)]
<p>
These are rather pleasant greens, though a touch coarse, with a basic 
flavor similar to the Chayote squash, but, well, greener. They are 
suitable for soups and stews as they don't turn to mush within a 
reasonable cooking time. I definitely prefer these to Long Bean or 
Squash leaves, also found in the Philippine markets.</p>

<p>In Southeast Asia these may be stir fried with garlic, but more 
commonly with garlic and dried anchovies or dried shrimp. They are 
also prepared with shiitake mushrooms in Vietnam.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are easiest to find in a large Philippine 
market, of which we have plenty here in Southern California - because 
our entire health care system runs on Philippine immigrants. My local 
market puts out bundles of greens on Friday or Saturday morning for sale 
over the weekend.

<p>Do not depend on the sign. Various greens tend to get jumbled in the 
markets, and they presume their customers know what they're buying. 
Note the many straight and curled tendrils (the "dragon whiskers"). The 
leaves are medium size, fairly thin, devoid of fuzz, and have a sandpaper 
feel on the dark side.</p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Loosely wrapped, these greens will last several 
days in the fridge, if they were in good shape to start with.<p></p>

<h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp;  Strip the leaves and tender tips from the tough 
stems, discarding the stems. You can use stems at the tip to the point 
where they will snap off cleanly. The tendrils can be used, though they 
will make your dish a bit coarser, but not the stems they originate from. 
Unlike many greens, the leaf stems are not as tough as the main stems, 
and those of smaller leaves can be used, again, to the point where they 
snap off cleanly.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Simmering time should be about 10 minutes, 
though the leaves will still hold together well and are not mushy at 
20 minutes. Steaming should be a little longer.<p></p>

<h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; A 1 pound 10 ounce bunch yielded 14 ounces 
edible (54%), but your bunches may vary. One recipe called for "2 
bunches, about 300 grams". Here in Los Angeles, a single bunch can 
run 800 grams, so I have no idea what the yield from her bunches 
would be.

<h2 id="root">Chayote Roots</h2>

[Ichintal]
<p>
The tuberous part of the chayote root is starchy and edible, used 
similarly to yams, but for some reason has attracted little attention as 
a potential agricultural crop.  Perhaps farmers prefer to leave them in 
the ground to grow more greens and fruit.
