<h1>Kabocha Squash</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
  [Japanese Pumpkin (Australia / New Zealand); Auyama (Spanish); Fak Thong 
  (Thai); Danhobak (Korea); Cambodia Ab&oacute;bora (Portugal); Kabocha, 
  Bobora (Japan);  Red Pumpkin (India); <i>Cucurbita maxima</i>]
<p>
This excellent winter squash is the one to use when a recipe calls for 
"Pumpkin". While all squash originated in the Americas, this one was 
taken to Japan from Cambodia by Portuguese sailors. "Kabocha" is a 
Japanese corruption of "Cambodia". They may have come to Cambodia from 
India where closely related "pumpkins" are very popular, and those probably 
came from the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Though Kabocha is <i>C. maxima</i>, while  West Indian Pumpkin (Auyama) 
is <i>C. moschata</i>, it is considered a fine substitute for that squash. 
It is the same shape with almost exactly the same internal color, flavor 
and cooking properties.</p> 

<p>Kabocha may range from 1-1/2 to 8 pounds, but average around 2-1/2 pounds 
in markets here in Los Angeles. Farms in California started growing them 
for export to Japan, but the Japanese only wanted the largest ones, so 
the smaller were sold in Los Angeles. Soon they were grown by many farms 
(seeds come with every squash) and are now one of the most common squash 
here in the Southland. Eventually, the Japanese decided the smaller ones 
were better, but had to keep taking big ones, as the small ones were all 
being sold here.</p>

<p>Today, these squash are grown as far afield as South Africa, Tasmania 
and Chile. Most of the crop from California, Colorado, Tonga and New 
Zealand is exported to Japan. This I have to say; given the tonnage 
in markets here in California, if most of our crop goes to Japan, 
that's one huge pile of squash.</p>

<p>The larger of the photo specimens was 6-1/2 inches diameter, 4 inches 
high and weighed 3-1/4 pounds. The smaller was 5-1/4 inches diameter, 
3-1/2 inches high and weighed 1-1/2 pounds.</p>

<p>Once aged (see "Growing") Kabocha flesh is very sweet and intensely 
orange. It is even tasty eaten raw.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; In Japan, this squash is often used for 
<i>Nimono</i>, simmered in a stock of dashi, soy sauce and sake until 
tender and the stock has simmered down. It is also much used for 
vegetable tempura. This is a prime squash for soups and stews, and for 
recipes that call for "Pumpkin", whatever nationality the recipe may 
be. It holds its shape well in cooking and has excellent favor. It may 
also be oven roasted like Acorn Squash. In Jamaica, it is used in 
Chicken Foot Soup.

<p>Note that when doing ethnic recipes where "pumpkin" presumes a local 
type, as it always does, you may have to add a little water to the recipe. 
Our Kabochas, having been aged for months to improve flavor and texture, 
have rather dry flesh. If the recipe calls for sweating the pumpkin in 
it's own juices, you will have to add a little water.</p> 

<h3>Growing:</h3> &nbsp; These squash are easy to grow, but are rather 
dry and bland at harvest. Once removed from the vine, they are stored in 
a warm place (around 77&deg;F) for 13 days while starches convert to 
sugars. they are then moved to a cool place (around 50&deg;F) for 
another month, or as long as 2-1/2 months.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California these are available 
in practically every produce market and supermarket. They should be a 
matt green color with light green spots and streaks (a patch of orange 
won't hurt). They should be hard and heavy for their size, and without 
bruises. The stems should be dry and shriveled, showing they have been 
aged. Here in Los Angeles, produce markets usually charge about 2016 
US $0.98 / pound, but the photo specimens were purchased from a large 
Asian market in San Gabriel for $0.69 / pound.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; They'll keep in a cool dry place for a couple 
of weeks. Once cut they should be refrigerated and used 
within a few days.<p></p>

<h3>Peeling <small>&amp;</small> Prep:</h3> &nbsp; The best way to peel this 
squash is with a "Y" shaped vegetable peeler <u>going around the squash</u> 
not up and down. The skin is thin and edible, so you don't 
need peel deep, or peel it at all except for color. The best way to cut this 
rather hard squash is to place it on the cutting board, position a razor 
sharp Chinese cleaver knife on it, and drive it through with a soft faced 
mallet (see <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife &amp; 
Mallet</b></a>).<p></p>
