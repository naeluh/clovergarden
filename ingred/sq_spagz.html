<h1>Spaghetti Squash</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
  [Vegetable Spaghetti;  <i>Cucurbita peppo</i>]
<p>
This squash is quite a curiosity, but is also quite useful for making 
interesting side dishes. Despite the name, it is not a substitute for 
spaghetti, as it is entirely vegetable in taste and texture.</p>

<p>These squash are usually around 8 inches long by 5 inches diameter, 
weighting about 3 pounds, but they can be found up to 5 pounds and even 
over that. The photo specimen was 8 inches long and weighed 4 pounds.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This squash is quite common in markets here 
in Southern California, and since the ship well, probably most places 
in North America. Select squash that is heavy for its size, but entirely 
yellow or ivory. If there is any trace of green, it is not ripe enough.
<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; This squash will keep in a cool dry place for 
a week or so. Seeds inside may sprout, but the squash is still fine if 
firm. Once cut, they should be refrigerated and used within a few days, 
or they will mold.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; This squash is usually cut in half, seeded, and 
then roasted in a 400&deg; preheated oven for 45 minutes, cut side 
down. Don't overcook, the strands should still have a bit of crunch. 
There is no reason this squash couldn't be steamed, but I don't have 
timing on that.<p></p>
