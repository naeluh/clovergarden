Fluted Pumpkin (Nigeria only); <i>Cucurbita ficifolia</i> (sometimes 
called <i>C. pepo</i>)]
<p>
This squash originated either in Mexico or Peru, but is now also grown  
in Southern California, Southeast Asia and all through the warmer parts 
of Central and South America, as well as West Africa. It is popular 
in Mexico, particularly Oxaca, where it is eaten as a squash when 
immature, and used to make squash beverages (sometimes alcoholic) when 
mature. It has also been found to have medicinal uses, particularly in 
treating diabetes.</p> 
<p>The photo specimen was 11 inches long, 8 inches in diameter and 
weighed 16 pounds. Note that color pattern can vary. This is a very 
durable squash - the photo specimen sat on my kitchen floor for about 
6 months and still looked fine, though it lost some weight. Then it 
fairly quickly lost its bright color and dried out to a thin shell. 
I deliberately let it dry out so I could get mature seeds, which look 
like black pumpkin seeds.</p>

<h3><u>Confusion</u>:</h3> &nbsp; In Nigeria, this squash is called 
"Fluted Pumpkin", because of its hollow flute-like stems. What is called 
"Fluted Pumpkin" everywhere else is 
<a href="gd_flutpmpz.html"><i>Telfairia occidentalis</i></a>, which 
is just "Pumpkin" in Nigeria. The influence of the Internet is starting 
to change this, causing even more confusion. In recipes, if it calls for 
"slices of Fluted Pumpkin", it means immature Xilicayota, because the 
other one is not edible (only the seeds and leaves).<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California I have seen this 
squash for sale only once. Seeds are available so you would have to 
grow it yourself or know someone who grows it.<p></p>
