<h1>Zucchini Squash</h1>
<br><img src="img/sq_zuch13g.jpg" alt="Various Zucchini Squash" class=mrg>
[Italian squash; Courgette (UK); Cocozelle (Italy); <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
This is by far the most popular squash in North America, and even in England 
it is eclipsing the <a href="squash.html#vmar"><b>Vegetable Marrow</b></a>. 
Zucchini can be eaten raw in salads, or cooked in many ways.</p>

<p>Seeds for this summer squash came from Italy to the Italian farming 
communities of California. Growers here marketed it as Zucchini 
("little squash") and it became popular in trend setting Los Angeles 
restaurants.  From there it spread to the rest of the world and "Zucchini" 
has pretty much replaced the original name, Cocozelle - except for the 
British who insist on calling it a Courgette.</p>

<p>Zucchini now comes in a variety of sizes, shapes (including spherical) 
and various shades of green and yellow. As is so common with vegetables, 
the yellow varieties have a blander flavor than the green, and I don't 
use them.</p>

<p>Pictured are very young squash, much in demand for Mediterranean  and 
Middle Eastern cooking, a yellow variety and a medium size. Left to grow 
they could all have become the monster zeppelins found in back yard 
gardens. The small are 6-1/2 inches long, 1-1/8 inch diameter and weigh 
a shade over 3 ounces. The medium one was 8-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches 
in diameter and weighed 9-1/2 ounces. They shouldn't be allowed to get 
much bigger unless you intend to stuff them because flavor and texture 
will suffer. Also, if you pick them young you don't end up with that ton 
of zucchini you try to give away every year.

<p>In the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, Zucchinis are often stuffed, 
after removing the seed mass. In the Americas and most of Europe, they are 
more commonly cooked as slices with the seed mass intact.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; It would not be easy to find a produce section in 
a North American market that didn't have Zucchini. Size presented may vary 
by region depending on ethnicity of the local population. Do make sure there 
are no soft spots whatever on the zucchini.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The rule is, <u>don't overcook</u>, you want 
your zucchini slices or stuffed shells intact, cooked through, but still a 
little firm. For this reason, zucchini dishes do not reheat at all well. If 
your recipe will be reheated, use a <a href="gourds.html"><b>Gourd</b></a> 
instead. Opo and Angled Luffa are commonly available in North America, and 
Ash Gourd (Winter Melon) and Fuzzy Melon are very available in Asian markets.
<p></p>

<h3>Health &amp; Nutrition</h3>	&nbsp; Zucchini is very nutritious, with 
a good amount of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It also contains both 
soluble and insoluble fiber, which are good for digestion and gut health.
<p>Raw Zucchini can present some risk, but this is unlikely with commercial 
produce or garden zucchini from commercial seeds. Some zucchini, especially 
wild zucchini, contain dangerous amounts of cucurbitacins, which are toxic, 
but such zucchini will be very bitter. The rule is simple, if the zucchini 
is bitter, toss it. There is also a risk of gas from fermentation of soluble 
fiber in the gut, but this is rather unlikely in the quantities raw zucchini 
is normally eaten, usually in salads.</p>
