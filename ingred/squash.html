<h1>Squash</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>Squash (genus <i>Cucurbita</i>) are "Cucumbers" 
(Cucurbits or <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>) to the botanist, along with melons, 
gourds and actual cucumbers, To the agriculturist they are all "Vine 
Crops" and they are all fruit, but in culinary practice they are 
"vegetables".</span></p>
<p>Squash are native to North, Central and South America, and were 
unknown in Europe and Asia until about 1500. Seeds were carried worldwide 
by the Portuguese and other European traders, so squash are now familiar 
crops in most countries, and unique varieties have been developed.

</ul>

<h2 id="hist" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Squash have been cultivated in Central America for as much as 10,000 years, 
and in South and North America also from prehistoric times. They are one 
of the three complimentary crops Native Americans planted together, corn, 
beans and squash. This combination provides complete nutrition. In 
particular, squash seeds are high in protein, dietary fiber, niacin, 
iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium and phosphorus, and also a good source 
of riboflavin, folate, pantothenic acid and potassium.</p>

There are two broad categories of squash:
<ul>
<li><h3>Summer Squash:</h3> &nbsp; Thin skinned squash picked before full 
  maturity. They are full of pulp and seeds inside, never hollow. They 
  do not mature into winter squash with a hard shell and thick flesh but 
  rather turn yellow and either rot if not picked in time or dry out to 
  a thin hard shell with seeds rattling around inside. Summer squash cook 
  very quickly and are eaten skin-on. Some varieties are eaten raw in 
  salads.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Winter Squash:</h3> &nbsp; Hard shelled squash, generally thick 
  fleshed but hollow in the center where the seeds are. Some are also eaten 
  immature as if summer squash, but most are picked when mature, and "cured" 
  to further harden the shell. The shells are split, the seeds scraped out and 
  the flesh is cooked, either cut from the shell or baked in the shell. 
  Winter squash is often used in soup, either as chunks or as pur&eacute;e. 
  The seeds of some varieties are used as a separate food product.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>There are several species of squash.</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3><i>C. maxima</i></h3> includes most winter squash, for example  
  Hubbard, Buttercup, Kabocha, and some Pumpkins. These are identified by 
  their stems which are spongy and lack ridges.</li>
<li><h3><i>C. pepo</i></h3> includes nearly all the common summer squash 
  like zucchini and yellow crookneck, but also some winter squash, 
  particularly the Halloween pumpkins (not pie pumpkins), spaghetti 
  squash and acorn squash. The stems of these squash are deeply ridged.
  </li>
<li><h3><i>C. moschata</i></h3> includes the butternut squash, the 
  pumpkins used to make pumpkin pie, the West Indian Pumpkin, and a few 
  lesser known varieties.</li>
<li><h3><i>C. mixta</i></h3> is represented by the cushaw varieties.</li>
<li><h3><i>C. ficifolia</i></h3> (figleaf squash), typified by the 
  Xilicayote, it is the least grown of the squash species.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Varieties</h2>

<p>There are many more varieties of squash than shown here but these are 
ones commonly offered in Southern California markets. The purely 
decorative varieties that show up around Thanksgiving, mostly C. Pepo, 
aren't included.</p>

<h3>Note on photos:</h3> &nbsp; Some of the orange fleshed squash 
are much more orange than shown in the photos. The Kodak digital camera 
used for many of the earliest photos did fine with the orange on the 
outside of squash but was totally blind to the orange of the inside, and 
its successor wasn't a lot better. The current Canon model is able to see 
this orange color. There are still a few older photos that haven't 
been replaced yet.<p></p>

<h2 id=acorn>Acorn Squash</h2>
<br><a href="sq_acornz.html">
<img src="img/sq_acorn09e.jpg" alt="Acorn Squash" class=mrg></a>
[#4750/51/52; <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
This popular winter squash is available year round throughout North America. 
It's Generally a very dark green with an orange patch where it rested on the 
ground (#4750) but White (#4752) and Gold (#4751) varieties are also 
recognized. See also the <a href="squash.html#carny"><b>Carnival Squash</b></a> which 
is basically a variegated acorn squash. This squash is popular for baking, 
stuffing and soup, but don't overcook or it can become mushy. The green 
photo specimen was 4-5/8 inches in diameter and weighed 1-1/2 pounds. 
<a href="sq_acornz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Ambercup</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_ambercup1k.jpg" alt="Ambercup Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>
A cross between the <a href="squash.html#butter">Buttercup</a> and 
<a href="squash.html#hubg">Golden Hubbard</a> squash, the Ambercup looks like a small 
pumpkin and generally weighs around 2-1/2 pounds.  An exceptionally sweet 
winter squash, it's considered one of the finest for eating. This squash 
has an extraordinarily long storage life. I have not, however, seen it 
here in Southern California.
<small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0152</a></small>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Banana Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_banana01e.jpg" alt="Banana Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>Growing to about 30 pounds, this is one of the largest squash, so it's 
generally sold cut into pieces. The photo specimen was probably over 18 
inches long and probably weighed around 16 pounds. As the name suggests 
it's a long narrow squash but is more likely pink, gray or even dark gray 
rather than yellow. The flesh of this squash is pleasant, sweet and 
actually quite tasty raw so don't overcook it.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id=butter>Buttercup Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_butcup03e.jpg" alt="Buttercup" class=mrg>
[<i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>
Not to be confused with the popular <a href="squash.html#bnut">Butternut Squash</a>, 
Buttercup is related to the <a href="squash.html#turb">Turban Squash</a> and has a 
bulge on the bottom but not as prominent as on the Turban. The photo sample, 
which exhibits the classic buttercup block shape with bulge on the bottom, 
was 6-1/2 inches diameter and weighed 2-7/8 pounds. This squash is not 
particularly meaty but it has very large seeds good for roasting.</p>
<p>Buttercup is not common commercially in Southern California but some 
show up in early October. It's a popular garden variety in other parts 
of the country. The flesh is creamy orange (much more orange than in the 
photo) and sweeter than most other winter squash but not as sweet as 
Butternut. It can substitute for sweet potato in recipes and is excellent   
baked the same as <a href="squash.html#acorn">Acorn Squash</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

[Butternut Pumpkin (Australia); <i>C. moschata</i>]
<p>
This medium size (2 to 5 pounds) bottle shaped winter squash 
has very sweet orange flesh. The flavor is described as somewhat like 
sweet potato, and it can substitute for sweet potato in recipes. It's 
one of the most widely available squash in North America, appearing in 
most produce markets and supermarkets all year.

<h2 id="carny">Carnival Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_carny02e.jpg" alt="Carnaval" class=mrg>
[#3142, <i>C. Pepo</i>]
<p>
Basically a colorful <a href="squash.html#acorn">Acorn Squash</a> with similar 
characteristics but listed separately here because it's always sold as 
"Carnival", never as "Acorn". It should show a significant amount of green - 
if it goes all orange it's probably beyond its peak flavor. See 
<a href="sq_acornz.html"><b>Acorn Squash</b></a> for cooking details.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cassabanana</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_casaban01c.jpg" alt="Cassabanana Illustration" class=mrg>
[Casbanan, Sikana, Musk Cucumber; <i>Sicana odorifera</i>]
<p>
This "squash" doesn't actually belong here, being of genus <i>Sicana</i>, 
but as the only <i>Sicana</i> species we haven't anywhere else to put it, 
and it belongs to the same family and tribe as squash. It is grown in the 
hotter parts of Latin America and by Cajun people in the far south of 
the United States - it needs considerable heat to ripen. Unripe it can 
be cooked as a vegetable, but it is most valued for the ripe fruit, 
which can be up to 24 inches long. The ripe flesh is aromatic with a 
sweet melon-like taste. It is eaten raw and made into preserves. The 
ripe flesh is always orange, but the skin may be orange, or as purple 
as an eggplant depending on variety.

<h2>Chayote</h2>
<br><a href="sq_chayotz.html">
<img src="img/sq_chayote01e.jpg" alt="Chayotes" class=mrg></a>
[Vegetable Pear, Mango squash (English); Christophene, Cho-cho, Tayota 
(Caribbean); Mirliton, Merliton (Cajun, Creole); Choko (Australia); 
Chouchou (Africa); Sayota (Philippine), Gayota (Latin America); 
PLU #4761, <i>Sechium edule</i>]
<p>
Pronounced chy-O-tay, this vegetable is technically not a squash because 
it belongs to genus <i>C. Sechium</i> not <i>C. Cucurbita</i> but we put 
it here because it's normally called a squash and because there isn't any 
other place for it.</p>
<p>An odd squash it is - it looks like a giant seed. Each "squash" 
consists of a very large embryo within a smooth but very thin seed coat 
and a thick layer of flesh over that. A notch is left at one end through 
which the seed sprouts. Native to Central America, chayotes are now grown 
worldwide. It is quite popular in India and Southeast Asia but the two 
biggest exporters are Costa Rica (worldwide) and Veracruz Mexico (to the 
U.S.).</p>
<p>The photo shows two regular Chayotes, which average about 3 inches 
across, 4-3/4 inches long and weight about 9 ounces each. There is also a 
smaller rounder variety with a dark green skin that has better flavor but 
is very rarely seen here. There are also yellow varieties (Perulero) 
and very dark green ones (Guisquil) grown in Guatemala. The big 2 
pound spiky chayote in the back has excellent flavor, but you won't see 
them in most regions. Grocery people hate them because they'll stab you 
right through bags and lightweight gloves. Food writers have been 
endlessly puzzled by early reports that the chayote was "like a 
porcupine" because they were unaware of this variety, or other spiky 
varieties from Central America. Shoots and tender leaves are also edible 
and are a common vegetable in Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. 
The elongated root tubers are starchy and also edible. &nbsp;

<h2>Cushaw Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_goose01e.jpg" alt="Green and White Cushaw Squash" class=mrg>
[Gooseneck Squash, <i>C. mixta</i>]
<p>
Cushaw squash are grown mainly by home gardeners rather than commercially 
- but I found the photo specimen in the Autumn, grown by a Southern 
California producer of mainly decorative squash. They are characterized 
by a bulbous body topped by a long, often curved neck, which may be thick, 
thin or bulbous. A number of varieties are available, white, green 
and striped, and some can grow to around 15 pounds.  The photo specimen 
was a green and white striped variety with deep orange flesh which is 
one of the most popular, and considered a good cooking squash. It was 
13-3/4 inches long, 7 inches diameter and weighed 6 pounds 4 ounces. 
1 named it "Goosey" and let it dry out. It sits upright in a small bowl.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="delic">Delicata Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_delicat07e.jpg" alt="Delicata Squash" class=mrg>
[Sweet Potato squash, Peanut squash, Bohemian squash; <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
This small, very sweet winter squash is seasonably available in 
supermarkets in Southern California, The photo specimen was 6-1/4 inches 
long, 3-1/2 inches in diameter and weighed 1-1/4 pound, a bit above 
average. The skin is cream color with green stripes but when over-ripe it 
is yellow with orange stripes. This recently reintroduced heirloom 
variety is one of the few winter squashes with skin thin enough to be 
eaten. It is similar to the <a href="squash.html#sdump">Sweet Dumpling</a> squash 
except for shape.
<br class=cll></p>




<h2>Eight Ball Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_eight05h.jpg" alt="Eight Ball Squash" class=mrg>
[Tondo di Piacenza, Round Zucchini, <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
Very <a href="squash.html#zuch">Zucchini</a> like despite its different shape. It's 
firmer and less seedy than Zucchini but interchangeable in recipes (unless 
shape is an issue). Not a standard supermarket squash but often available 
at produce markets here in Southern California. The photo specimens are 
quite dark, but varieties the same color as Zucchinis are also common.

<h2>Gold Nugget</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_goldnug02e.jpg" alt="Gold Nugget Squash" class=mrg> 
[Oriental Pumpkin, <i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>
A modest size winter squash ranging from 1 to 3 pounds with thick orange 
flesh. It turns from a bright shiny orange to a dull orange when ripe. 
These can be cooked whole (pierce a couple small holes into the seed 
cavity) or cut in half lengthwise and cooked cut side up. See 
<a href="sq_acornz.html"><b>Acorn Squash</b></a> for method.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="hub">Hubbard Squash</h2>
<br>[<i>C. maxima</i>] &nbsp; A family of large squash weighing up to 30 
pounds that are generally teardrop shaped or may be pointed at both ends. 
Originally these had a warty skin but most sold today are smooth. One 
warty version still sold is Chicago Warted Hubbard. These squash are 
very durable and can be kept up to 6 months if properly stored (50&deg;F, 
70% humidity, stems removed).<p></p>

   [<i>C. maxima</i>]
   <p>
   This squash becomes available in September in Southern California. This 
   variety is a little different from the ones I see in photos from other 
   parts of the country in that it isn't at all pointy at the flower end.
   The photo specimen was 7-1/2 inches in diameter and weighed 4-1/4

[Japanese Pumpkin (Australia / New Zealand); Auyama (Spanish); Fak Thong 
(Thai); Danhobak (Korea); Cambodia Ab&oacute;bora (Portugal); Kabocha, Bobora 
(Japan); Red Pumpkin (India); <i>Cucurbita maxima</i>]
<p>
This excellent winter squash is what you want for recipes calling for 
"pumpkin". This applies worldwide. Kabocha was taken from Cambodia to Japan 
by Portuguese sailors in 1541 - "Kabocha" is Japanese for "Cambodia". They 
may have come to Cambodia from India, where closely related "pumpkins" are 
very popular to this day. They may range from 1-1/2 to 8 pounds, but average 
around 2-1/2 pounds in markets here in California. These squash are now grown 
as far afield as South Africa, Tasmania and Chile. Most of the crop from 
California, Colorado, Tonga and New Zealand is exported to Japan.

<br><img src="img/sq_kamo01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Kamo Kamo Squash" class=mrg>
[Kumi Kumi pumpkin; <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
This is the traditional squash of the Maori people of New Zealand, at 
least traditional since Europeans brought squash to the islands. It is 
a double duty squash, suitable as a summer squash when young, and as a 
winter squash when fully ripe. Ripe, it will have an extremely hard shell, 
and excellent keeping properties, up to a year under the right storage 
conditions. It is an excellent eating squash either unripe or ripe. 
The photo specimen was 5-1/4 inches diameter and 3-3/4 inches high, 
weighing 1 pound 9-1/4 ounces.

This is actually a "winter squash", but it is generally eaten immature, 
as if a summer squash. In this state it is firmer and sweeter than 
Zucchini, They grow up to about 4 inches in diameter and may be spherical 
or sort of avocado shaped. They are also edible as a winter squash. 
This squash is fairly interchangeable with the Aehobak, or 
"Korean Zucchini". The photo specimens were a little over 3 inches diameter

Zucchini. They are juicier, slightly sweet, and taste lightly of Butternut 
or Acorn Squash.</p>

<p>These are getting fairly common in the Korean markets here in Southern 
California, and are being grown commercially in Mexico. They are packaged

<p>A squash related to the <a href="squash.html#zuch">Zucchini</a> grown in 
England. Unlike the zucchini it has a rather firm shell and a soft seed 
mass which is scooped out. They are described as "Overgrown when picked, 
insipid when cooked". Due to bland flavor they are most often stuffed 
with meat mixtures. They can grow to 30 pounds, but are generally 
harvested much smaller. While formerly quite popular in England, they 
are being displaced by the Zucchini (English "Courgette") as the English 
slowly learn to cook.

This common summer squash comes in regular light green, white and yellow 
varieties. Due to its shape it's often hollowed out and used for stuffing, 
sometimes with its own pulp mixed with other ingredients. This is a very 
tender squash with definite sweetness and I consider it among the best 
for use raw in salads and on vegetable plates. Its high ratio of shell 
to seed mass helps it hold together well when cooked. The photo specimen

   They may range from 1-1/2 to 8 pounds, but average around 2-1/2 pounds in 
   markets here in California. In North America, your main option to the 
   Kabocha is the <a href="squash.html#cast"><b>Castile Pumpkin</b></a>, or the 
   <a href="squash.html#hub"><b>Hubbard Squash</b></a> which is much less common here 
   in Southern California.

   <p>This is the favorite "Pumpkin" in much of India. It is very closely 
   related to the <a href="squash.html#kabo"><b>Kabocha</b></a>, which makes a fine 
   and very available substitute. While the Kabocha is green on the outside, 
   so are many "Red Pumpkins" sold in India - they vary from green through 
   orange, to yellow depending on cultivar. They are all the same color as 
   the Kabocha on the inside.

   <h3>Dickinson Pumpkin</h3>
   <br><img src="img/sq_moschap01h.jpg" alt="Moschata Squash, Ukraine" class=mrg>
   [<i>C. moschata</i>]
   <p>This is your pumpkin pie "pumpkin". A proprietary cultivar of this 
   squash is grown by farmers under contract to Libby's, and used for their 
   canned "100% Pure Pumpkin", which holds about 89% of the canned pumpkin 
   pie filling market. They are a light tan color on the outside but the 
   thick, dry flesh is intensely orange on the inside. The photo specimens 
   are actually <i>C. moschata</i> cultivar <i>polianyn</i> grown in Ukraine, 
   but    side by side you wouldn't be able to tell them from the Dickinsons 
   used    by Libby's. Perhaps they are from bootlegged Dickinson seeds.

   [Calabaza de Castilla; <i>C. moschata</i>]
   <p>While the Dickinson's used by Libby's are a proprietary cultivar, this 
   is a widely available "pie pumpkin" you can use at home. It's generally 
   light tan or grayish on the outside but the thick, dry flesh is intensely 
   orange on the inside. These pumpkins have deep sutures in the skin and 
   weigh up to 20 pounds, but the photo specimen was 10-3/4 inches diameter, 
   6 inches high and weighed 11-1/2 pounds. Some stores sell them cut into 
   smaller chunks.</p>
   <p>Commercial varieties include Buckskin, Chelsey and Kentucky. Local 
   varieties are popular in Mexico and the Caribbean. Mochatas are also 
   popular in Japan.

   [<i>C. pepo</i>]
   <p>
   This squash is grown in Mexico primarily for its large seeds (Pepita), 
   which are very popular roasted as a snack. The seeds are also essential 
   in many recipes, particularly Moles (sauces). The photo specimen was 
   7-1/2 inches diameter and weighted 3 pounds 3 ounces.

   [<i>C. maxima</i>]
   <p>These are the pumpkins you grow to win pumpkin growing contests. 
   The photo specimen, grown near Port Elgin, Canada, was 1678 pounds (768 kg), 
   and growers are trying for a ton. The most popular contestant is Atlantic 
   Giant, which is orange, but giant C.maxima come in various shades of green, 
   gray, yellow, orange, and white. Modest size maxima pumpkins are used for 
   food worldwide, and several are listed on this page.

[Orange Hokkaido, Baby Red Hubbard, Uchiki Kuri (Japan), #4774, 
<i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>
A hard shelled winter squash with firm yellow flesh. The flavor is mellow 
and described as tasting somewhat like chestnuts. The photo specimen was 
5-1/2 inches in diameter and weighed 1 pound 11 ounces. They are available 
year round but become common in Southern California produce markets in 
September.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Scalopini</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_scalopini02h.jpg" alt="Scalopini Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
The name "scalopini" is often used as a generic name for patty pan 
squash, but more specifically refers to a very dark green hybrid variety 
that is lightly scalloped and quite high for a patty pan. It has a 
sweet, somewhat nut-like flavor, and a good texture for using raw in 
salads. The largest of the photo specimens was 3-3/4 inches diameter 
and 2-1/2 inches high, weighing about 8 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Spaghetti Squash</h2>
<br><a href="sq_spagz.html">
<img src="img/sq_spaghetti02e.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Squash" class=mrg></a>
[Vegetable Spaghetti, <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
This winter squash variety is unique in that when cooked the flesh 
separates into crisp spaghetti-like strands. The example shown was about 
8 inches long, 5 inches diameter and weighed a little over 4 pounds.</p>
<p>The main variety is yellow as pictured, but an orange variety has been 
developed that is somewhat sweeter. In a University of Florida consumer 
test, consumers preferred the appearance of the orange variety but preferred 
the taste of the traditional yellow variety.

<h2>Squash Blossom</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_blossom02h.jpg" alt="Squash Flowers" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
Squash Blossoms are most used in Mexican and Italian cuisines. Male 
flowers, most often from Zucchini, are used as these will not produce 
squash. They may be stuffed, usually with light cheeses, and fried or 
baked. They are also used in soups and pasta sauces.	 They are valued 
for their sweet floral flavor and aroma, as well as their conveniently 
large size and stuffability. They are generally around 3-1/2 to 4 inches 
long, not counting the stem.	These were purchased from a large 
multi-ethnic Market in Los Angeles (Altadena, actually).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Squash Greens</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_greens02h.jpg" alt="Squash Greens" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo?</i>]
<p>These greens can occasionally be found in Philippine markets here in 
Los Angeles (Filipinos use many kinds of greens not commonly used 
elsewhere). My local market in Eagle Rock puts out greens like these late 
on Friday afternoon or early Saturday for the heavy weekend shopping, as 
they are very perishable. I do not know precisely what kind of squash 
these greens came from, but I was not too impressed with these as their 
fuzziness doesn't go completely away upon cooking.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Sunburst Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_sunburst06e.jpg" alt="Sunburst Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>A common summer squash which can be use anywhere summer squash is 
called for. This is a yellow version of the <a href="squash.html#patty">Pattypan</a>, 
listed separately here because it's always sold under the Sunburst name. 
Dark green with light broken stripes right up until ready to harvest, it 
then turns yellow and is at its peak when there's still some green in the 
center.</p>
<p>In common with yellow varieties of other green vegetables, the flavor 
is a bit bland and it is definitely less sweet than the regular green 
pattypan. Use it where you want a decorative accent but choose the green 
for flavor. The right photo specimen was 3-5/8 inches diameter, 2-1/8 
inch thick and weighed 4-3/4 ounces. This squash is very tender but its 
high ratio of shell to seed mass helps it hold together when cooked.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sdump">Sweet Dumpling Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_sdumpl04e.jpg" alt="Sweet Dumpling Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
Due to its small size and shape this is a favorite squash for stuffing 
and roasting whole for individual portions. Available September through 
December it is sweeter than most <i>C. pepo</i> squash. The photo 
specimen was 4-1/4 inches diameter, 3 inches high and weighed just under 
1 pound but they are often smaller. This squash is very similar to the 
<a href="squash.html#delic">Delicata</a> except for shape.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Yellow Crookneck Squash</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_yellow07e.jpg" alt="Yellow Crookneck Squash" class=mrg>
[<i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
Practically the definitive summer squash until the coming of the 
<a href="squash.html#zuch">Zucchini</a>, this squash can be used in just about any 
summer squash recipe that doesn't require the zucchini's cylindrical 
shape. As with other yellow squash, the flavor is a bit bland compared 
to the green zucchini. The photo specimen was 6-1/2 inches long, 2-5/8 
inches in diameter and weighed 9-3/4 ounces.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Tromboncino</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_tromb10h.jpg" alt="Whole Tromboncino" class=mrg>
[Zucchetta, Zucchino rampicante, Climbing zucchini, Climbing crookneck, 
Trombolino d'albenga, Trombetta, Serpentine squash; <i>C. moschata</i>]
<p>
Originally from Liguria in Italy, this is a popular summer squash there 
and around the world. It is used mainly as a summer squash because when 
mature it is a little more watery than other winter squash. Flavor is 
very good, a little lighter than dark green Zucchini, and it can be used 
wherever a summer squash is called for. The photo specimen was about 
19 inches long, 3 inches in diameter and weighed 1 pound 6 ounces. The 
shaft was about 1-1/4 inches diameter.
<br class=cll></p>

[<i>C. maxima</i>]
<p>
Related to the <a href="squash.html#butter">Buttercup Squash</a> this squash is seen 
at various times of the year in Southern California but becomes quite 
common in September. It is often used as an autumn decoration, but it's 
quite edible with orange flesh described as having a somewhat hazelnut 
flavor. The specimen in the photo, viewed from the flower end, was 
8-1/2 inches in diameter, 6 inches high and weighed 5-1/3 pounds.

[Giraumon, (Caribbean); Joumou (Haiti); Calabaza (Spanish, not unique); 
Auyama (South America, Caribbean, not unique); Ayote (Central America); 
Kalabasa (Filipino); <i>C. moschata</i>]
<p>
This is a very popular squash in the Caribbean and in the Philippines. It is 
also grown in the tropical Americas. There are various cultivars, some more 
squat than the one in the photo, similar to a Kabocha, and color also varies.
As Joumou, it is very important to the national soup of Haiti, also called 
Joumou.</p>
<p>This squash is not common in North America, however, the 
<a href="sq_kabochz.html"><b>Kabocha</b></a> is considered a very suitable 
substitute, even though it is <i>C. maxima</i>, not <i>C. moschata</i>. 
Kabocha is also often called Calabaza or Auyama in regions that use those 
names.

This squash originated either in Mexico or Peru, but is now also grown  
in Southern California, Southeast Asia and all through the warmer parts 
of Central and South America, and even in Africa. The photo specimen was 
11 inches long, 8 inches in diameter and weighed 16 pounds.

[Italian squash; Courgette (UK); Cocozelle (Italy); <i>C. pepo</i>]
<p>
Seeds for this summer squash came from Italy to the Italian farming 
communities of California. Growers here marketed it as Zucchini 
("little squash") and it became popular in trend setting Los Angeles 
restaurants.  From there it spread to the rest of the world, and "Zucchini" 
has pretty much replaced the original name, Cocozelle - except for the 
British who insist on calling it a Courgette.</p>
<p>Pictured are very young squash, much in demand for Mediterranean and 
Middle Eastern cooking, a yellow variety and a medium size. Left to grow 
they could all have become the monster zeppelins found in back yard gardens. 
The small are 6-1/2 inches long, 1-1/8 inch diameter and weigh a shade over 
3 ounces. The medium one was 8-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches in diameter 
and weighed 9-1/2 ounces.

<h2 id="health">Health &amp; Nutrition</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Toxicity:</h3> &nbsp; There is some concern for eating Zucchini and some 
other summer squash raw due to content of toxic cucurbitacins. Eating raw 
with proper washing is not a problem with commercially grown squash. Squash 
from other sources could be a problem. The key here is bitterness. 
Cucurbitacins, like many other toxins, are very bitter, so if you bite into 
a raw Zucchini or other summer squash and it is bitter, best to discard.
<p></p>

<h3>Benefits:</h3> &nbsp; Squash, both Summer and Winter varieties, are 
clearly beneficial to health, low in calories but strong in both vitamins 
and minerals. They are considered excellent for eye health due to high 
Vitamin A content.

<p>Here are some figures for typical Winter (Butternut) and Summer (Zucchini)
