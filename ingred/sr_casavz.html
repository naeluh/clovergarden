<h1>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</h1>
<br><img src="img/sr_cassava03g.jpg" alt="Cassava Roots, whole and cut" class=mrg>
[Manioc; Yuca (Hispanic); Balinghoy, Kamoteng kahoy (Philippine); 
Mogo (Africa);  Mandioca, Tapioca-root (India); <i>Manihot esculenta</i>]
<p>
Cassava / Manioc is native to South America, but is now a critically  
important food crop through the tropical and subtropical regions of 
the world. Nigeria is now the largest producer, and Thailand is the 
largest exporter of dried Cassava products. Roots are rated "sweet" 
(not bitter) if they have a low cyanide content and "bitter" if they 
have a high cyanide content. Bitter Cassava requires special processing 
before consumption, but the FDA doesn't allow that variety to be sold 
in the United States. The largest of the photo specimen was 11-1/2 inches 
long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed just over 1 pound.</p>
<p>Cassava root should not  be eaten raw, but is peeled, chunked and 
boiled to make it edible. It is then drained and used as chunks or 
mashed, similarly to potatoes. South American natives use cassava to 
make a mildly alcoholic beverage, cauim, with fermentation started by 
spitting into the vat, the same method once used to produce sake in 
Japan.

<h3>Buying &amp; Storing:</h3> &nbsp; Cassava is sold in the U.S. mainly 
under the name "Yuca" (not at all related to our southwest Yuccas (two "c") 
which are agaves, not spurges). It is widely available anywhere there are 
Latin American communities. The roots are generally heavily waxed to keep 
them from drying out. Even waxed roots are very perishable, so you should 
buy them from a source with high turnover and carefully check them to make 
sure they are firm, heavy, and with no soft spots whatever. Use them within 
a couple days at most. Unwaxed cassava will go off flavor in two or three 
days even when refrigerated. Roots are extremely sensitive to water loss, 
and spoilage starts with purple streaks internally.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp;  Cassava must be peeled, which will also remove 
the heavy wax coating. After peeling, if it is to be kept more than an hour 
or two, it should be kept under water acidulated with citric acid or lemon 
juice to prevent discoloration. In wet cooking, modest size cubes will keep 
their shape quite well, but some will open up with cracks. Whole cylindars 
of the root, when cooked tender, will split lengthwise into two or more 
pieces. This makes it very easy to pull out the thin fibrous core.<p></p>

<h2 id="gari">Gari</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_casavg01k.jpg" alt="Mound of Gari Granules" class=mrg>
This was a basic travel food of West 
Africa, but is now used for many other occasions. The granules can even 
be eaten dry, but better, simply mix with an equal amount of cold water 
and a little salt. After sitting for 20 minutes or so, it makes a fine 
accompaniment for spicy stews and the like, with an interesting, slightly 
sour flavor. It is also used in a great number of other ways, both as 
a featured ingredient or sprinkled on food as a simple condiment.
<p>Gari is made by peeling and grating or mashing cassava tubers, then 
fermenting the mash for 5 days to remove the cyanide. It is then put in 
porous bags and pressed in a screw or hydraulic press to remove as much 
liquid as possible. After this it is sifted to remove fibers and reduced 
to the desired particle size. Next it is roasted over a wood fire in a 
large iron pan for 20 to 30 minutes, after which it is cooled and 
sieved. Particles that don't pass the sieve can be sold as a lesser 
grade.	Some Gari is processed with Palm or Peanut oil at one or more 
stages of its production.

<h2>Manioc Farina</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_casavfr01k.jpg" alt="Mound of Manioc Farina Granules" class=mrg>
This is the Gari of Brazil, and is manufactured by a similar fermenting 
and granulating process. The most important use is to make the extremely 
popular side / breakfast dish Farofa, where it is roasted with other 
ingredients, particularly butter. For an example, see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/asv_farof1.html"><b>Farofa</b></a>.
<p>This product comes in two versions, "Cruda" (raw) or Torrada (roasted). 
The Torrada has a somewhat nutty flavor. The Cruda is often toasted before 
use. African Gari is easier to find in North America, and pretty much 
identical to the Cruda.

<h2>Cassava Flour / Manioc Flour</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_casavf01k.jpg" alt="Mound of Cassava Flour" class=mrg>
<p><u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; This product is not the same as Tapioca Flour. 
It is dried and ground whole Manioc roots, not just the starch extracted 
from them. It has become very popular in North America because it is as 
close to wheat flour as you can get and still be gluten free. It is 
also nut-free, vegetarian, vegan and grain free, so is acceptable 
to people on the Paleo Diet. Of course, real Paleo humans gathered and 
ate grains any time they were in season.</p>
<p>This product is produced similarly to Gari, but it is not fermented. 
Also, rather than being roasted, it is sun dried, then ground extremely 
fine in a pin mill. This processing reduces cyanide content without 
fermenting.

<h2>Tapioca Flour / Tapioca Starch / Manioc Starch</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_tapio02k.jpg" alt="Mound of Tapioca Starch" class=mrg>
<p><u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; This product is not the same as Cassava Flour. 
Tapioca flour is used as a common thickener worldwide, and in the form 
of tapioca pearls to make puddings and deserts. Tapioca is used to make 
the jelly balls in the boba drinks popular in East and Southeast Asia 
and with children in North America.</p>
<p>Production of Tapioca is more complex than Cassava Flour, because 
there is an extraction step to separate the starch from the other 
components of the flour. It may be formed into granules, or into beads 
of various sizes.

<h2>Sour Tapioca Flour / Acid Manioc Starch</h2> 
<br><img src="img/sr_tapios01k.jpg" alt="Mound of Sour Tapioca Starch" class=mrg>
<p>This product is made from Tapioca flour by Fermenting and Sun Drying 
(only natural Sun Drying works). This process gives the Tapioca Starch 
some unique properties. In baking, it expands without yeast, baking soda 
or other leavening agents. It is used in many specialty baking 
applications, including gluten free breads and pastries. Most of this 
flour is made in Brazil.

<h2>Cassava Leaves</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_casavl01k.jpg" alt="Cassava Leaves on Plant" class=mrg>
Cassava Leaves are edible, after being properly cooked to rid them of 
Cyanide. Cooking time should be at least 10 minutes, with the cooking 
water discarded. The leaves are particularly high in protein for a 
leafy green (3.7%), which is much more than the roots. It is high 
quality protein similar to eggs and soybeans, containing lysine, 
isoleucine, leucine, valine, and  arginine, not common in green leafy 
plants.
<p>Flavor of the leaves is not strong, but taste like a mix of spinach 
and peas. They are usually used in fairly strongly flavored soups 
and stews. Cassava Leaves are a major source of nutrition in Indonesia. 
Dried powdered Cassava leaves are sometimes available from markets 
dealing with African ingredients. Dried and Frozen Cassava Leaves are 
often available in Philippine markets here in Southern California.
