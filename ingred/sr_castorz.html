<h1>Castor Bean</h1>

[<i>Ricinus communis</i>]
<p>
The attractive beans of this highly toxic shrub are used to make 
Castor Oil (which contains no toxins, but it tastes like it does). The 
mash left from oil production contains the super toxin Ricin, of which 
one milligram is enough to kill a man. One bean is said to be sufficient 
to kill a child, if broken or chewed, but if it is swallowed whole it is 
harmless. Believe or Don't: in West Africa Castor Beans are used as a 
food flavoring.</p>
<p>The seeds in the photo tried to kill me. I took a couple branches 
with seed heads home, and set them on one side of the kitchen. It turns 
out, when they dry, they fire the beans with great force. Some sailed 
all the way across my large kitchen and landed on the counter near my 
coffee grinder. At first I thought they were spilled coffee beans and 
almost put them in the grinder, but noticed the different color in 
time.</p>

<p>Castor oil was once used mainly internally as a laxative and to induce 
vomiting. Today it is used mainly externally for various ailments and has 
become highly valuable in the manufacture of plastics and for industrial 
processing.</p>
<p>Castor oil has a very high film strength and slipperiness at high 
temperatures and pressures so is used as a motor oil for race cars 
(Castrol R). Those of us who were enthusiasts back in the days when cars 
were cars can go all nostalgic by splashing a little castor oil 
on a sheet of metal hot enough to make it smoke.</p>

<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; In West Africa Castor Beans are ground and 
fermented to make a flavoring paste called Ogiri-Igbo. Yes, Caster Beans 
are <u>extremely toxic</u>, but 4 days of fermentation is said to 
destroy the toxins - not that I'm going to try that.</p>
