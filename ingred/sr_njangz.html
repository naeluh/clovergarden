<p>
This large tree, growing to about 160 feet, is native to tropical Africa 
from Senegal east to Tanzania and south to Angola and Mozambique. It is 
also found on Madagascar. The part used for food is the seed kernel. The 
kernels are ground and used as a flavoring thickener. They are also pressed 
for oil. Both male and female trees must be present to produce fruit. The 
center for seed kernel production is Cameroon. These seed kernels are used 
primarily in West Africa and Central Africa.</p>

<p>When the fruit is ripe, it falls from the trees and is gathered from 
the ground, then left in big piles to rot. When they have rotted, the 
seeds, about 0.6 inch diameter, are separated out by washing and 
boiling the fruit. The seeds are then soaked overnight in cold water. 
They are then boiled again until the shells crack. The shells are 
removed using a knife, and the seed kernels are set out to 
dry.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I have purchased these on-line under the 
name Djansang for 2018 US $3.50 per ounce, product of Cameroon.
<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Njangsa are pounded to paste before including 
in recipes, since their main purpose is both as a flavoring and 
thickener. They are put in when there will still be a fair amount of 
cooking time to develop their thickening properties<p></p>

<h3>Subst:</h3> &nbsp; These taste similar to Southeast Asian 
<a href="sr_candlez.html"><b>Candlenuts</b></a>, another spurge, but are a 
bit stronger and more resinous. Candlenuts are used very similarly.
