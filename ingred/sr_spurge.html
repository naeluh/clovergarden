<h1>Spurge Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
Spurges (<i>Euphorbiaceae</i>) are a very large and incredibly 
diverse family ranging from large trees to herbs to many forms resembling 
cacti. Many, particularly the cactus-like ones, are used as decoratives 
and the rubber tree is of great economic importance, but only a very few 
are at all edible. Most spurges are somewhat toxic, some are extremely 
toxic and many are allergenic. Some have significant medicinal value. 
This family is so large that botanists divide it into three subfamilies 
containing many tribes and subtribes, but since few are edible we don't 
bother with that here.

<br><img src="img/sr_safbolit01e.jpg" alt="Azafr&aacute;n de Bolita Seeds" class=mrg>
[Azafr&aacute;n, Azafr&aacute;ncillo; <i>Ditaxis heterantha</i>]
<p>
This seed is used as a substitute for saffron in Mexico, for the color 
of course, it can't replace the flavor and aroma. It is used mainly in 
soups, but also in rice. The most famous soup using this spice is 
Menudo Amarillo, which is so well known it is used to describe color, 
but I have yet to find a recipe for it. The photo specimens, purchased 
from a multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles were 0.26 inch diameter.

<h2>Candlenut</h2>

[Kukui nut (Hawaii); Indian Walnut; Buah keras (Malay); Kemiri 
(Indonesia); Lumbang (Philippine); <i>Aleurites moluccana</i>]
<p>
Nuts of a tree native to Southeast Asia, and spread by humans to the 
extent its true origin can not be determined. Polynesian settlers brought 
it to Hawaii where it became very important - the nuts for food and the rest 
of the tree for wood, dye, tanning chemicals, medicines and flowers for leis. 
Unshelled nuts take a gem-like polish and are used to make bead necklaces. 
As Kukui, it is the state tree of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Candlenuts are mildly toxic raw and sometimes used as a purgative.
Shelled nuts are a bit larger than shelled macadamia nuts and have a 
softer, lumpier appearance. The largest photo specimen was 1 inch long, 
7/8 inch across and 5/8 inch thick, typically 10 to the ounce. While 
shelled Macadamia nuts (completely unrelated) are often used as a substitute, 
the flavor is considerably different, though the oil content is similar. 
As a nut, the macadamia is quite superior.

<h2>Cassava</h2>
<br><a href="sr_casavz.html">

[Manioc; Yuca (Hispanic); Balinghoy, Kamoteng kahoy (Philippine); 
Mogo (Africa);  Mandioca, Tapioca-root (India); <i>Manihot esculenta</i>]
<p>
Cassava / Manioc is native to South America, but is now a critically  
important food crop through the tropical and subtropical regions of 
the world. Nigeria is now the largest producer, and Thailand is the 
largest exporter of dried Cassava products.. Roots are rated "sweet" 
(not bitter) if they have a low cyanide content and "bitter" if they 
have a high cyanide content. Bitter Cassava requires special processing 
before consumption. The largest of the photo specimen was 11-1/2 inches 
long, 2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed just over 1 pound.</p>
<p>Cassava is used to make a number of very important products, including 
Gari, Manioc Farina, Cassava Flour, Tapioca Starch, and Sour Tapioca 
Starch. The leaves are also edible.

<h2>Castor Bean</h2>

<img src="img/sr_castor05e.jpg" alt="Whole Castor Beans" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Ricinus communis</i>]
<p>The attractive beans of this highly toxic shrub are used to make 
Castor Oil (which contains no toxins, but it tastes like it does). The 
mash left from oil production contains the super toxin Ricin, of which 
one milligram is enough to kill a man. One bean is said to be sufficient 
to kill a child, if broken or chewed, but if it is swallowed whole it is 
harmless. Believe or Don't: in West Africa Castor Beans are used as a 
food flavoring. The oil has been used medicinally, as motor oil for 
race cars, and as an industrial feed stock.

<h2>Chaya</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_chaya01h.jpg" alt="Green Chaya Leaf" class=mrg>
[Tree Spinach; <i>Cnidoscolus aconitifolius</i>]
<p>
This large shrub is native to northern Mexico to Guatemala and cultivated 
as far south as Peru. It can grow to 20 feet but is usually kept pruned 
to 6 feet for ease of harvesting. Leaves of this plant are more 
nutritious than any other land growing green, and the plants are more 
productive than any other leafy green. The leaves are a popular vegetable 
in Mexico and Central America. There are several cultivars, and the one 
without stinging hairs is most cultivated because it's easier to harvest. 
Raw leaves are toxic (cyanide) and need to be simmered for about 20 
minutes before being served, usually with oil or butter. Simmering also 
destroys the stinging hairs on varieties that have them.

<h2>Inca-peanut</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_incapn01h.jpg" alt="Green Inca-Peanut Pod" class=mrg>
[Sacha Inchi, Sacha peanut, Mountain peanut; <i>Plukenetia volubilis</i>]
<p>
This vine, native to the Peruvian rain forest, has been cultivated for 
hundreds of years in that region. It bears star shaped pods with four 
to 7 points, each point containing a flat oval seed about 3/4 inch long. 
The pods are allowed to dry on the vine, then harvested and the seeds 
are shelled. They are toxic raw but pleasantly flavored when roasted. 
The seeds are about 27% protein, and that protein is well balanced for 
human nutrition. They are about 40% fats.</p>
<p>These seeds have recently entered the health food market because of 
their high Omega 3 content. The effectiveness of vegetable Omega 3 is 
not yet well established, but these nuts are being sold as a healthy 
snack based on that oil content, and the oil as a supplement, 
particularly for people on a vegetarian diet. It should be remembered 
that oils high in Omega 3 are subject to rapid rancidity. Growing and 
harvesting this vine has been bringing money into rural areas where it 
is much needed.

[Indian Acalypha; Poonamayakki, Kuppaimeni (Tamil); Pokok Kucing Galak 
(Malay); <i>Acalypha indica</i> similar: <i>A. bipartita</i>, 
<i>A. fruticosa</i>, &amp; others]
<p>
This herbaceous plant is native to India, Southeast Asia and Oceania. It 
is also found on the Islands of the Indian Ocean and in West Africa, 
probably introduced there. Young leaves and leaf shoots are used as a 
vegetable in those regions, and particularly in West Africa. The plant 
is also an important medicinal throughout its range, and particularly 
to the Tamil people of southern India and Sri Lanka.	 Leaves of 
<i>A. bipartita</i> and <i>A. fruticosa</i> are similarly used in 
West Africa. The leaves are bland to a little bitter and are usually 
chopped up and added to cooking beans and peas. Dried leaves of 
<i>A. fruticosa</i> are used for teas in Ethiopia. The Malay name 
means "Excited Cat Tree", as it has a more powerful effect than 
catnip.

[Samak (Philippine), Parasol Leaf Tree, <i>Macaranga tanarius</i>]
<p>
A small tree native to Southeast Asia used for medicinal purposes 
and in the Philippines as a flavoring ingredient in the famous 
<a href="sours.html#ilocos">Ilocos vinegar</a>. The leaves and bark 
are used in fermented drinks. Its nasturtium-like leaves, with the stem 
entering almost at the center of the leaf, are used as flavoring food 
wrappers in much of Southeast Asia. It is planted as an ornamental in 
tropical regions and is listed by the USDA as a common invasive in 
Hawaii.

<h2>Mongongo</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_mongo01e.jpg" alt="Cracked Mongongo Nut" class=mrg>
[<i>Schinziophyton rautanenii</i>]
<p>
This medium tree (up to 65 feet) is found widely in southern Africa. It 
has provided edible fruit and nuts for local peoples for at least 7,000 
years. The whole fruits are collected from the tree, of just nuts are 
recovered from elephant dung.  Dry fruits are steamed to soften the 
skin, which is peeled to expose the maroon colored flesh. The fruit is 
then boiled until the flesh separates from the nuts. The flesh is eaten 
and the nuts dried and stored for up to a year. Of course, nuts 
recovered from elephant dung need only be washed and stored. The shells 
are cracked to expose the nuts, which may be eaten whole or pounded into 
flour to be used in recipes.</p>
<p>The nuts are about 57% fat, which is 44% polyunsaturated, which means, 
once the nuts are cracked, storage life is limited due to rancidity. 
They are 24% protein and contain significant amounts of vitamin E, 
calcium, manganese, zinc and copper.

<p>
This large tree, growing to about 160 feet, is native to tropical Africa 
from Senegal to Tanzania, south to Angola and Mozambique, an on 
Madagascar. The part used for food is the seed kernel. The kernels are 
ground and used as a flavoring thickener. They are also pressed for 
oil. Both male and female trees must be present to produce fruit. 
The center for seed kernel production is Cameroon.

<h2>Poinsettia</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_poinset02h.jpg" alt="Red Poinsettia Flowers" class=mrg>
[<i>Euphorbia pulcherrima</i>]
<p>
Named for Joel Roberts Poinsett who popularized it to the U.S., this 
decorative spurge is very mildly toxic so should not be eaten and should be 
avoided by those with latex intolerance. This is a tricky plant to grow. 
Making it branch well requires a (formerly secret) grafting process and 
getting multiple buds requires a bacteria infection. They are difficult to get 
to bloom well after the first year due to a need for at least two months of 
uninterrupted very dark nights in autumn.</p>
<p>Red, pink, white and variegated varieties are most common but Mr. Poinsett 
reported seeing a blue one. Extensive searching has not confirmed this. You 
can get a Christmas poinsettia to survive by making sure it's pot is well 
drained and well watered, but it will get quite rangy after the second 
year.

<h2>Rubber Tree</h2>
<br><img src="img/sr_rubber02e.jpg" alt="Rubber Tree Foliage" class=mrg>
[Para Rubber Tree, <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>]
<p>
This tree, Native to Amazonian Brazil, produces nothing edible but is 
interesting as the source of the latex natural rubber is made from. Cultivation 
in its native Brazil has not been satisfactory but successful plantations 
continue to produce in Southeast Asia. The trees stop producing at 25 to 30 
years old and are cut down. The wood (rubberwood) from these trees is prized 
for making high end furniture. This tree should not be confused with the 
common decorative "rubber tree" (<i>Ficus elastica</i>) nor with the tree 
used by the Aztecs for their rubber balls (<i>Castilla elastica</i>), both 
being entirely unrelated.

<h2 id="health" class=lrg>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition</h2>

<p>Spurges are all toxic, to some degree, in whole or in part, and exude 
sap that can be a severe irritant. For those that are used for food, 
cooking instructions should be followed accurately. In particular, those 
high in cyanide need to be cooked in an open pot sufficiently to drive 
off the cyanide gas.</p>
<p>Cyanide, at low levels and with limited exposure is not dangerous. It 
is the distinctive flavoring in almonds.</p>

<p>We definitely do not recommend any spurges be included in a raw foods 
diet, but then we do not recommend a raw foods diet, though I've heard 
it is an effective male anti-fertility strategy (due to malnutrition).
