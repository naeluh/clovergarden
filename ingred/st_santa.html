<hr size="2" noshade>

<p>The Sandlewood Order (<i>Santalales</i>) consists of plants most of 
which are partly or entirely parasitic, including Mistletoe. Most are 
hemiparasites, which means they have chlorophyll and produce some of 
their own energy, but tap water and minerals from other plants. Some 
of the mistletoe members, and a few others of the order, are entirely 
parasitic.

<br>For the famous incense sandlewood (<i>Santalum album</i>) I have 
no mention of food value, but several closely related species do. All 
sandlewoods are hemiparisites, producing sugars by photosynthesis but 
stealing water and nitrogen from host plants, most often acacia species. 
For cultivation both the sandlewood and the host have to be planted 
and maintained together.

   This small tree, or more commonly shrub, is found in scattered 
   populations in all of southern mainland  Australia, from the center 
   of the country on south. The red or sometimes yellow fruit is 
   spherical and about 1-1/2 inches diamter with tart flesh described 
   as tasting like peach, apricot or rhubarb. The flesh is thin, only a 
   little more than 1/10th inch thick, covering a hard nut shell with a 
   convoluted brain-like surface. Within the shell is a nut so high in 
   oil it will burn like a candlenut.</p>
   <p>Both the fruit flesh and the nut are edible, and both were used by 
   the native people of Australia, though more commonly the nut. Fruit 
   was harvested from the tree and could be dried, but nuts could be 
   more easily gathered from emu droppings, passing through the birds 
   with no damage. The fruit of this tree is now being exploited 
   commercially, with most of it exported from Australia into the 
   exotic food market (if it's rare and expensive it must be a 
   "superfood" right?). Pilot projects to farm this tree are under 
   way.

   <br><img src="img/st_mistl01h.jpg" alt="Berries on Shrub" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0">
   </p><p>
   This mistletoe is native to California, Nevada and Arizona in the U.S. 
   and Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California in Mexico. Desert Mistletoe, 
   like all Mistletoes, is a shrub that roots to branches of trees. Like 
   others, it is a hemiparisite, having enough chlorophyll to produce 
   much of its own energy, but sucking water, minerals and other 
   nutrients from the host tree. Like other mistletoes, the plant is 
   very toxic, but unlike the others, the fruits are edible - if the 
   plant is growing on mesquite, ironwood or catclaw acacia.</p>
   <p>American Indians gathered the berries when they became translucent, 
   between November and April. Some ate them raw, others mashed them and 
   cooked them to a paste or pudding consistency. The foliage is reputed 
   to be halucinogenic, but the dosage is impossible to judge, so persons 
   trying it are as likely to end up dead as tripping.

   Native to South Africa, this shrub or small tree is rated as  
   "facultatively hemiparasitic", which means it prefers to suck some 
   of its nutrients from other plants, but it can actually survive 
   on its own if need be.  The fruits, up to nearly 1 inch long and 
   over 1/2 inch diameter are edible. they have been used by the 
   Khoikhoi people both fresh and as dried pulp. The taste has been 
   described as "plumlike", but also as "sour and tingly". An extract 
   boiled from the bark has been used to flavor tea.

   Native to Northern Australia, Indonesia and New Guinea, these shrubs 
   or small trees are rated as a hemiparasite, sucking some of their 
   nutrients and water from nearby plants. The Fruit is a bit strange. 
   The real fruit is a nut at the end of a stem, but during the ripening 
   the stem swells to almost 1/4 inch diamtere and takes color, orange 
   or red. The nut itself is not edible, but the swolen stem is. It is 
   ripe when about to fall off the tree, and may be eaten raw or cooked.

are not as dependent on paracitism as the related sandlewood family.

   These spiny shrubs, growing to 20 feet, are native to Sub-Saharan 
   Africa. They produce fruits about 1.4 inches long and an inch in 
   diameter, which range from orange to red when ripe. The juicy flesh 
   is the same color. They contain a hard nut containing a seed that is 
   valuable for oil, though not cooking oil. The fruit is sour, 
   but edible raw, and best when just a bit over-ripe. It is also used 
   to make jams for storage, and used in deserts.

   This sprawling shrub or small tree is native to tropical woodlands in 
   Florida and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. It can be parasitic on 
   the roots of nearby trees. The yellow or orange fruits, about 1 inch 
   long, can be quite sour, a bit bitter with an almond flavor (cyanide), 
   or pleasant and plum-like in flavor. They can be eaten raw of made 
   into jams and jellies or used in refreshing beverages. In Asia, young 
   leaves are cooked as a vegetable, but need to be cooked well to drive 
   off the cyanide they contain. Oil from the single seed kernel can be 
   used for cooking. The plant is also used medicinallly, particularly 
   for constipation.

   This fairly large tree (to 120 feet) is native to western Africa from 
   Sierra Leone south to Angola and East into Zimbabwe (DR Congo). The 
   fruit is about 1-1/2 inches long with red or green flesh about 0.15 
   inch thick. The nuts have a very hard shell and a kernal that is 
   50% fat, mostly Oleic Acid (monounsaturated). I have seen no mention 
   that the flesh is edible, but the nut kernels are said to have a taste 
   between hazlenuts and chestnuts. They can be eaten raw, roasted or 
   boiled before consumption and are often used mixed with meats in 
   recipes. The oil can be used for cooking.
