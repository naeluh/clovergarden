<h1>Starches, Thickeners <small>&amp;</small> Gels</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>In Medieval times, sauces were made as reductions of 
broths from many ingredients, including beasts, fowl and game of all 
kinds. These broths were boiled down until thickened. Changing 
socio-economic conditions made this unaffordable, and chefs learned 
to make sauces from broths thickened with starches, mostly based on 
wheat flour.</span><p></p>

<span class=bg>In Asia, sauces were made on the fly in the last moments of cooking. 
The long cooking required with wheat flour obviously couldn't work, so 
other, purer starches came into use. These have been widely adopted for 
modern methods here in the West, for sauces, stews, soups and commercial 
products.</span>
<br class=cll><p></p>

<span class=bg>Non-starch thickeners have also come into use for special purposes, 
and some are gaining a presence in home kitchens</span>

<p></p>

<table class=tbl>

<tr><th>Name</th><th>Power</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cornstarch<br>Cornflour</td><td>1.0</td><td>Good 
  all-around thickener, but with relatively strong flavor. It makes 
  sauces glossy but somewhat cloudy. Liquid must be at boiling when 
  added, but long cooking after adding will break it down, as will 
  stirring while re-heating. Make a slurry with twice the amount of 
  water before stirring in to avoid lumps. It does not take well to 
  freezing and doesn't work well with acidic foods. It will do better 
  if taken off the heat before acids are stirred in. 1 teaspoon will 
  thicken about 1/2 cup of sauce.</td>
  </tr>
<tr><td class=nop>Potato Starch</td><td>2.0</td><td>A good, 
  powerful thickener, but its thickening power is quickly weakened by 
  boiling. Add at the end of cooking and avoid boiling. In 
  Chinese recipes, do not substitute for cornstarch where the coating 
  is also the thickener for the sauce or you'll end up with far too much 
  sauce. Potato starch thickened sauces reheat better than cornstarch 
  thickened, but don't bring to a full boil. Potato starch is preferred 
  for baking as it withstands higher temperatures. It is acceptable for 
  Passover.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=nop>Sweet Potato Starch</td><td><br></td><td>
  Sweet potato starch is seldom used for thickening - it is used mainly 
  for coating meats and vegetables for frying where a crisp surface is 
  desired. It is sold in Asian markets as a powder and as granules for 
  this purpose. It is also made into noodles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=nop>Tapioca Starch</td><td>2.0</td><td>Thickens 
  well at lower temperatures than cornstarch. It is often used to correct 
  the thickness of a sauce at the last minute. Freezes well. Add to hot 
  liquids at the last minute because it breaks down with heat faster than 
  potato starch and a lot faster than cornstarch. No flavor and makes a 
  clear but rather glossy sauce. Sub: instant tapioca (grind to powder 
  unless you desire some texture); glutinous rice flour; potato starch (not 
  for freezing).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arrowroot</td><td>1.5</td><td>Flavor neutral and 
  better for thickening acidic foods than cornstarch. Freezes well and is 
  more resistant to breaking down from heat than cornstarch. It will 
  thicken well below the boiling point so can be used for fragile sauces. 
  It produces a clear sauce and the appearance is less glossy than 
  cornstarch. It is relatively expensive but that's not really 
  significant for home use. Arrowroot should not be used in dairy based 
  sauces as it turns them slimy. It should be made into a slurry with 
  cold water before adding to hot liquids.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td>Water Chestnut
  <br> &nbsp; Starch</td><td>2.0</td><td>A starch made from cooked 
  and dried Water Chestnuts. It is much used in South and Southeast Asia as 
  a thickner and coating for frying. It is used to thicken soups when they 
  should remain very clear and it has no flavor. It is quite durable in 
  boiling. It should be made into a slurry with cold water before adding to 
  hot liquids, and should be given a bit more time at temperature than for 
  cornstarch. Do not mistake Water Chestnut Flour (Singoda) for the starch, 
  it is not at all the same.
  </td></tr> 
<tr><td>Glutinous Rice Flour</td><td><br></td><td>Actually 
  "gluten free", this thickener freezes well. Do not confuse it with 
  regular rice flour. This flour can be sprinkled over simmering liquids 
  and stirred in without clumping until you have the right thickness. 
  Sub: tapioca starch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wheat Flour</td><td>0.5</td><td>A good thickener 
  for sauces and gravies which does not make them look glossy (but also 
  they  will not be clear). Very stable and holds about the same as it 
  cools. It thickens at boiling temperature and must be thoroughly cooked 
  before or after adding. Most commonly this is done by cooking in butter 
  to make a roux, but too much cooking will weaken its thickening power. 
  A dark roux has very little thickening power. Cake flour has the most 
  thickening power, bread flour the least, but all purpose flour is 
  usually used.</td>
  </tr>
<tr><td>Beurre mani&eacute;</td><td>0.5</td><td>This is a 
  kneaded mixture of butter and flour, but it isn't pre-cooked, so it must 
  have sufficient cooking time in the soup or sauce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sago</td><td>2.0</td><td>Made from the inner pulp 
  of a palm. Sometimes found in Asian markets. It needs to be cooked 
  fairly long to develop its thickening power, but is thus rather heat 
  stable. There is another Sago starch made from the inner pulp of a 
  Cycad, but it is seldom found in commerce.</td>
  </tr>
<tr><td>Kudzu</td><td>0.7</td><td>Kudzu flour will thicken at 
  room temperature. Rare and expensive - Southerners would rather complain 
  about kudzu than learn to use it. When cooking with kudzu it should 
  be mixed with cold water before stirring into hot liquids and should 
  be stirred well for a while as it has a tendency to sink to the bottom.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sahlab</td><td>1.0</td><td>Made from the root tubers 
  of an orchid grown in Turkey. Export is currently forbidden and most 
  "sahlab" on the market is fake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Instant ClearJel&reg;</td><td><br></td><td>A modified corn starch 
  much used for commercial pie fillings and similar applications. It 
  thickens  without cooking, is acid stable, stable at high temperatures 
  and takes freezing well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ClearJel&reg;</td><td><br></td><td>A modified corn starch much 
  used for commercial pie fillings and similar applications. It is also 
  much used in home canning as the only thickener approved by the USDA 
  for canning applications (Instant ClearJel&reg; is not suitable). 
  Unlike Instant ClearJel&reg; it is not usable where the product will 
  be frozen.</td></tr>

<p></p>

<table class=tbl>

<tr><th>Name</th><th>Power</th><th>Description</th></tr>


<tr><td>Guar Gum</td><td>8.0</td><td>Made from a South Asian 
  bean, it's powerful but clumps like  crazy. Best mixed with sugar or salt 
  (whichever goes into your recipe) and stir briskly while adding. Some add 
  through a salt shaker for better dispersal. Do not attempt to use as a 
  slurry, it will clump. It will thicken at room 
  temperature, but takes a long time so heat is often used. Prevents formation 
  of ice crystals in frozen foods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Xanthan Gum</td><td>3.0</td><td>This non-starch 
  thickener is increasingly popular with the fancy chef set because its 
  high thickening power allows it to be used in very small amounts which 
  do not affect flavor. At room temperature it is an effective thickener 
  at 1% concentration. It looses strength with heat so it's most used 
  in room temperature or cooled applications. It has unique properties 
  that make it particularly useful in salad dressings and chili sauces. 
  It's made by fermenting sugar with a particular bacterium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Agar<br>kanten<br>Agar-agar</td><td><br></td><td>Made from 
  seaweed,  this is similar to gelatin, but stronger and gels without 
  refrigeration. Approved for vegetarians. It can be substituted about 
  1:1 for gelatin. it is available in Asian markets. It does not work 
  well with acid foods, or foods containing oxalic acid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Glucomannan<br>Konjac Flour</td><td><br></td><td>This white 
  powder is a soluble fiber extracted from 
  <a href="am_konjaz.html">Konjac</a> corms. It can gel at room 
  temperature, has 0 carbs, nearly 0 calories, and is diabetic and 
  vegan safe. It firms up more with wet cooking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pectin</td><td><br></td><td>A natural gel agent found in fruit. 
  It's main use is in the production of fruit jellies and jams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carragenan</td><td><br></td><td>Derived from seaweed
  (<i>Chondrus crispus</i> - Irish moss), this gel agent is widely used 
  in commercial products, particularly dairy products such as yogurt or 
  sour cream. This ingredient has been found to cause inflammation, even 
  in the quantities used in commercial products, and it can possibly 
  result in gluten sensitivity. It is best avoided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gelatin</td><td><br></td><td>A natural product of meat and fish 
  released with heat. Commercial gelatin is made by boiling hides and 
  bones of domesticated animals. Commercial gelatin is used mostly to 
  produce gels and aspics. 1/4 ounce will set 16 ounces of liquid.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td>Blood</td><td><br></td><td>Formerly used as a thickener by almost 
  all meat eating peoples (though forbidden by Jewish law),  blood 
  has fallen out of favor in "mainstream" (squeamish) North American 
  societies, and is banned by law in some regions. Here in Southern 
  California, tubs of blood (coagulated and non-coagulated) are widely 
  available in Asian and other ethnic markets.</td>

<h2 id="swork">How Starches Work</h2>

<p>Starches are long chains of glucose molecules. Glucose is a type of 
sugar. Unlike sugars, starches are insoluble in water or alcohol. There 
are two main types of starch produced by plants for energy storage, 
amylose and amylopectin. The animal form, Glycogen, similar to a highly 
branched amylopectin, is not considered here.</p>

<p>Plants store starches in crystalline form in granules. When exposed to 
heat and moisture these granules swell and burst, releasing the starch 
molecules, which unwind from their crystalline form to become amorphous 
and tangled.</p>

<p>Amylose is in the form of very long almost unbranched chains that 
tangle severely when released, thus amylose is a most effective thickener, 
entrapping large amounts of liquid among its tangled chains. When cooled 
amylose tends to become stiff.</p>
 
<p>Amylopectin forms short chains that are highly branched, not as 
effective as a thickener, but more effective at creating gels. When 
cooled, amylopectin does not become as stiff as amylose.</p>

<p>The proportions of these two starches greatly affects the cooking 
characteristics of starchy foods. Also the Glycemic index (of interest 
to diabetics) is lower for amylose than for amylopectin.</p>

<p>Rice, for instance, ranges from long grain with mostly amylose to short 
grain with mostly amylopectin. Long grain cooks up fluffy and relatively 
dry. When cooled it becomes stiff, a good start for fried rice. Short 
grain rice is mostly amylopectin and cooks up rather sticky. "Glutinous" 
or "sticky" or "sweet" rice is entirely amylopectin and cooks up very 
sticky indeed (and contains no gluten).</p>

<p>Potatoes are another example, ranging from russets with mostly amylose 
to round whites, high in amylopectin. Russets stay dry and fluffy, 
excellent for baking and mashing but fall apart with boiling and other 
wet cooking methods. Round whites boil up firm and hold their shape in 
soups and stews. Others are in between.</p>

<p>Starches come from two main sources: seeds (wheat flour, cornstarch) 
and roots or tubers (potato starch, arrowroot). The amylose chains of root 
starches are longer than those of seeds, thus potato starch is a more 
effective thickener than cornstarch.</p>
