<span class=bg>In early times the only sweeteners available were natural 
fruits, and honey robbed from industrious bees. In tropical lands there 
was also sweet wild cane and sweet sap from palm flowers. Once ways were 
found to extract sugar from these sources this "refined" product became 
an important article of trade.</span><p></p>

<span class=bg>Many studies show that sugars are all very damaging to 
health in the amounts most people consume in North America, but 
artificial sweeteners are not likely any safer. The information on this

<h2 id="gen">General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p>Sugar came to Europe during the Crusades. The Arabs had learned of  
cane sugar from their invasion of Persia where Darius had centuries 
before discovered "honey without bees" from his invasion of India.</p>

<p>Sugar cane appears to have been enjoyed by humans in Indonesia 10,000 
years ago but was first exploited as an industrial product in India. 
Because cane grows only in the tropics it was long very expensive 
in Europe due to trade monopolies and luxury taxes - in fact it was so 
expensive it was presumed to be a powerful medicine. Some things just 
never change.</p>

<p>Since sugar was an item of prestige, the stage was set for a sugar 
binge as it became less expensive, just as white rice did in Southeast 
Asia. Just as with white rice health problems followed (ask George 
Washington about his teeth).</p>

<p>The Spanish brought sugar cane to the New World where it grew 
exceedingly well. Molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, became a key in 
the "Triangle Trade". The English bought slaves in Africa and sold them to 
sugar plantations in the West Indies. Molasses was shipped from the West Indies 
to New England for conversion to rum. The English traded manufactured goods 
to New England for rum and raw materials, then sold manufactured goods and 
New England rum in Africa to buy slaves to sell in the West Indies.</p>

<p>While it had been known for over 150 years that sugar could also be made 
from beets, production of beet sugar didn't began until the Napoleonic wars 
when England cut off the cane sugar supply to continental Europe. It is now 
grown and refined widely in North America and Europe.</p>

<h2 id="art">Artificial Sweeteners</h2>
<br><img src="img/sw_artificial01c.jpg" alt="Packets of Artificial Sweeteners" class=mrg>
<p>
Artificial sweeteners have a checkered history. They've been quite 
successful in diet soft drinks, but have been less successful in baked goods 
where baking temperatures destroy them and where sugar does more than 
just sweeten. Research continues.</p>
<p><b>Health &amp; Safety:</b> &nbsp; Whether artificial sweeteners are 
safe has been hotly debated, with cancer the main concern. Now, due to 
improved studies, evidence is mounting that they contribute to an 
<u>imbalance in beneficial gut microflora</u> and cause <u>metabolic 
disruption</u>. The result is that they can actually 
<u>promote obesity</u>, quickly induce <u>pre-diabetic conditions</u>  
and encourage development of <u>type 2 diabetes</u>. This is exactly 
opposite of the presumed benefits to be gained from them. You can read 
more in an article at Science Daily (<a href="sweet.html#s11"><b>S11</b></a>).
<br class=cll></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Acesulfame K:</b> &nbsp; [Ace K, Sweet One, Sunnett, acesulfame 
  potassium] Similar to Saccharin but resistant to baking temperatures, 
  it is now found combined with Sucralose in some baked goods. Studies 
  of its safety have so far been few.</li>
<li><b>AminoSweet:</b> &nbsp; Aspartame rebranded to hide that fact that 
  it's aspartame - see below.</li>
<li><b>Aspartame:</b> &nbsp; [NutraSweet, Equal] was discovered in 1965. 
  It is used in Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi and other products. Aspartame can't 
  be used in baked goods because it can't stand heat. Once listed by the 
  military as a biological warfare agent, this sweetener was approved 
  under heavy political pressure (Dick Cheney was reportedly involved). 
  This was done despite very flawed testing and it remains highly 
  controversial among food scientists (<a href="sweet.html#s8"><b>S8</b></a>). 
  It accounts for more bad reaction complaints than any other FDA 
  approved substance. Among reported negatives: causing brain tumors 
  in rats at relatively low dosages, headache, memory lapses, vision 
  changes, convulsions, hallucinations, behavioral disturbances, nausea, 
  joint pain and degradation of mental function. Studies of multiple 
  artificial sweeteners have found aspartame to be the worst of those 
  tested, and it raises insulin levels as much as sugar does.</li>
<li><b>Cyclamate:</b> &nbsp; [Canadian Sweet 'N Low] was discovered 
  accidentally in 1937 and was the leading artificial sweetener in the 
  U.S. until banned by the FDA in 1970 because massive doses caused 
  cancer in rats. This ban is not in place in most countries and still 
  highly controversial due to the massiveness of the doses. The FDA is 
  considering reconsidering.</li>
<li><b>Dulcin:</b> &nbsp; This sweetener was used during World War I. 
  It was tasty but toxic and was withdrawn after a few children died 
  from it.</li>
<li><b>Neotame:</b> &nbsp; This latest sweetener approved by the FDA is 
  7000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar.</li>
<li><b>Rebiana:</b> &nbsp; A sweetener developed by Cargil derived from 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/stev">Stevia</a>. It got FDA approval in 2008 so is now on the 
  market.</li>
<li><b>Saccharin:</b> &nbsp; [U.S. Sweet'N Low] was discovered 
  accidentally in 1879. it's major marketing problem is an odd lingering 
  aftertaste. In 1977 Massive doses (similar to the Cyclamate study) fed 
  to rats caused cancer, so the FDA was going to ban saccharin, but 30 
  million angry overweight peasants with torches and pitchforks pounding 
  at their door caused them to reconsider. Warning labels were added to 
  saccharin packages but removed in 2000. Saccharin is banned in Canada 
  with U.S. banned Cyclamate taking its place.</li>
<li><b>S6973:</b> &nbsp; This is not actually a sweetener, but a 
  "sweetness enhancer" which makes the sweet receptors in the mouth more 
  sensitive to sucrose. This allows much less sucrose to be used, thus 
  fewer calories in the product. It is made by Senomyx in California and 
  has now received a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) rating from the 
  FDA. It can be used in all manner of baked goods and sweets but not 
  beverages - though a beverage version is being evaluated. It will 
  appear on nutrition labels as "artificial flavor" even though it has 
  no flavor of its own.</li>
<li><b>Sucralose:</b> &nbsp; [Splenda] This sweetener is made by adding 
  chlorine to regular sucrose (cane/beet sugar) making it sweeter and 
  indigestible (0 calories). The FDA approved it in 1998, and competitors 
  immediately sued the makers over the claim "made from sugar, tastes 
  like sugar". Splenda now has 50% of the artificial sweetener packet 
  market.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="agave">Agave Nectar</h2> &nbsp; -  &nbsp; [Agave Syrup]
<br><img src="img/yu_agavnect01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Agave Nectar" class=mrg>
<p>
This is another skillfully promoted food industry deception. The Agave 
Nectar of commerce is made not from agave sap but from agave starch. The 
conversion process is pretty much the same as for manufacturing 
<a href="sweet.html#high">High Fructose Corn Syrup</a> (HFCS), but the fructose content 
is <u>much higher</u> than with HFCS. This stuff is being promoted 
as "natural", as a "Health Food" and a healthy alternative to HFCS.  It 
is now widely sold in markets catering to the yuppie class and is spreading 
to mainstream markets.</p>
<p>Agave nectar is being advertised as having a "low glycemic index", but 
some researchers suspect that depending on low glycemic sweeteners actually 
increases insulin resistance, so what is sold as good for diabetics may 
actually make the problem worse in the long run.</p>
<p>Agave starch consists mainly of inulin (fructosan), a complex form of 
fructose which ends up as 58% to 92% fructose in the final product, with most 
of the rest being glucose. Having up to nearly twice the fructose of High 
Fructose Corn Syrup, it can cause severe health problems if used heavily.</p>
<p>Vegans often use Agave Nectar in place of honey, because honey exploits 
animals (bees). Apparently the poor agave worms crushed to death in the 
process of making agave syrup are not being "exploited". Vitamin B12 
content will depend on the number and quality of the worms crushed.
<br class=cll></p>
<p>My personal opinion is that agave nectar should be used only in 
moderation, preferably after it has been properly fermented, distilled, 
aged and bottled as Tequila.</p>

<h2>Allulose / Psicose</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [D-Psicose, D-allulose, 
  D-ribo-2-hexulose, 
 C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>12</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>] 
<br>This is an almost no-calorie sugar found in nature. A process has 
been developed to produce it from fructose by enzyme action. Taste is  
simmilar to sucrose, it has about 70% of sucrose's sweetness, and it 
behaves much like sucrose for culinary applications. It has little 
effect on glycemic response. It is currently popular in Japan as a 
"rare sugar", and the US FDA has issued a no-objection letter for GRAS 
(Generally Regarded as Safe) rating. It is not yet approved in Europe. 
The main drawback to this sugar is the cost of production, which is 
high.<p></p>

<h2 id="beet">Beet Sugar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sucrose]
<br><img src="img/ch_sugarbeet01c2.jpg" alt="Sugar Beets" class=mrg>
Sugar beet is a major crop in North America and Europe and has the 
advantage that it can be grown much closer to the customers in those areas. 
A molasses is produced by refining beet sugar but it isn't like cane molasses 
and is used for animal feed.
<p>Beet and cane sugar are both 99.95% sucrose, chemically identical and 
interchangeable for many applications, but not for all. In making 
confections, cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, butter cream, cookies and 
cakes they behave differently (<a href="sweet.html#s09">S9</a>) with cane sugar 
definitely superior.

<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Birch Syrup</h2> &nbsp; 
  - &nbsp; [varies but roughly Fructose 50%, Glucose 45%, other sugars 5%]
<br>Birch syrup is made by methods similar to making 
<a href="sweet.html#maple">Maple Syrup</a> but from birch trees in regions so cold 
maple trees dare not go there. Birch syrup is made in Alaska, Siberia, 
Finland and the coldest parts of Canada.
<p>Originally there was only one grade, dark - too dark and too strong to 
pour on pancakes but only used as a flavoring ingredient. Modern methods 
of lower temperature processing have made possible lighter grades similar to 
the grades of maple syrup. Birch syrup is made in quantities so small the 
USDA has been uninterested in regulating so grade names are arbitrary and 
simply made up by individual producers.</p>
<p>Birch syrup is much more difficult to make than maple syrup so costs 
about five times as much. Alaska is considered a large producer but total 
output there is probably under 2000 gallons U.S. per year. In Siberia and 
Finland birch sap is also made into soft drinks, beer and vinegar.</p>

<h2 id="cane">Cane Sugar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sucrose]
<br><img src="img/sw_sugar10e.jpg" alt="Sugar" class=mrg>
The sugar cane, <i>Saccharum officinarum</i>, is now grown throughout 
the tropics. Cane is crushed for the juice from which sugar is extracted 
in several "boilings".
<p>Sugar can be dried and packaged before all the color and "impurities" are 
removed. This may be done for flavor, for a "natural" color, or to satisfy 
"health enthusiasts" who think they're getting a more nutritious product. 
Well, they are, but nutrition in such minute amount as to not matter one 
iota - it's sugar and just as bad for you as any other sugar.
<a href="sweet.html#mol">Molasses</a> is a byproduct of this process.</p>
<p>Cane and Beet sugar are 99.95% chemically identical, but not always 
interchangeable, particularly for making confections, 
cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, butter cream, cookies and cakes where 
can sugar is superior - see <a href="sweet.html#s09">Note-S9</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<p>Cane sugar is sold commercially in several forms:
<ul>
<li><b>Barbados Sugar</b> is the same as Muscovado sugar.</li>
<li><b>Brown Sugar</b> is made by mixing some syrup back into the sugar. 
  Color and consistency depend on how much and what darkness of syrup is 
  used.</li>
<li><b>Castor Sugar</b> is white sugar with a very small crystal size.</li>
<li><b>Confectioner's Sugar</b> is white sugar ground to a fine powder and 
  mixed with cornstarch to keep it from caking. Because of the cornstarch it 
  cannot substitute for other sugars.</li>
<li><b>Demerara Sugar</b> is an "uncontrolled substance" which may be a 
  partially refined sugar with residual nutrients or may be manufactured 
  out of white sugar at a factory in England or Canada. Named for Demerara, 
  Guyana, it is made up of fairly large, slightly sticky crystals with a 
  distinctly yellow tint. In England it is the preferred sugar for coffee.</li>
<li><a href="sweet.html#gold"><b>Golden Syrup</b></a> is a white sugar syrup which 
  has been processed to split some of the sucrose into glucose and 
  fructose to prevent it from crystallizing.</li> 
<li><b>Icing Sugar</b> (see Confectioner's Sugar).</li>
<li><a href="sweet.html#jag"><b>Jaggery</b></a> is partially refined sugar sold in 
  loafs in Indian groceries. Note that some "jaggery" is not cane sugar but 
  one or another variety of <a href="sweet.html#palm">Palm Sugar</a>. Palm is more 
  expensive.</li>
<li><b>Muscovado sugar</b> is properly a dark sticky sugar with a molasses 
  flavor from the first boiling in the refining process. Today it is most 
  likely faked up from refined sugar and molasses at a refinery. It should 
  have a rum and molasses flavor and is available in dark and light 
  versions.</li>
<li><b>Powdered sugar</b> (see Confectioner's Sugar)</li>
<li><b>Preserving Sugar</b> is a white sugar of very large crystal size.</li>
<li><b>Raw Sugar</b> can be just about anything the seller wants it to be, 
  a partially refined sugar or a white sugar some refining byproducts have 
  been added back to. <a href="sweet.html#jag">Jaggery</a> from India is actually a 
  partially refined, thus "raw" sugar.</li>
<li><b>Refiners Syrup</b> - same as Golden Syrup.</li>
<li><b>Rock Sugar:</b> &nbsp; Cane sugar recrystalized from a 
  supersaturated solution, available in various natural and artificial 
  colors. See <a href="sweet.html#rock"><b>Rock Sugar</b></a>.</li>
<li><b>Turbinado Sugar</b> is supposed to be "washed raw sugar" from which 
  some of the surface molasses has been removed but may be faked up at a 
  refinery. It is named after the "turbines" used for the first separation 
  and is similar to Demerara Sugar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coconut Sugar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Gula Java (Indonesia)]
<br><img src="img/sw_cocon02h.jpg" alt="Loaf of Coconut Sugar" class=mrg>
<br>A variety of Palm Sugar, generally darker and with a smokier flavor 
than sugar from the Palmyra Palm.The photo block, from Indonesia, was 
2.3 inches diameter and 2.6 inches high, purchased from a large Asian 
market in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2017 US $2.19 for 9.5 oz. 
It was considerably softer and easier to shave off than regular palm 
sugar. Ingred: coconut sugar, cane sugar (5%).
<br class=cll>

<h2 id="corn">Corn Syrup</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Maize Syrup; Glucose, from 
<i>Zea Maize</i>]
<br><img src="img/gr_corns01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Corn Syrup" class=mrg>
<p>
Corn Syrup, a sugar that's almost entirely glucose, is created by enzyme 
processing of corn starch. It can be further processed into 
<b>High Fructose Corn Syrup</b>. The photo specimen is Karo Light corn 
syrup (they also have a dark, presumably to replace Malt Syrup in baked 
goods). This syrup is very widely available in North America, used as a 
sweetening and glaze. It is often used by Korean expats as a substitute 
for Korean <a href="sw_maltsz.html"><b>Malt Syrups</b></a>, and has 
somewhat replaced real malt syrup in Korea itself, due to being cheaper.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="high">High Fructose Corn Syrup [HFCS]</h2>
<br>This modified Corn Syrup is not generally a consumer product, 
but rather sold to food processors. Corn Syrup is further processed 
by enzymes to convert much of the glucose into fructose (about 42% 
fructose (HFCS 42)). Some is further processed to 90%, then mixed 
back to make a 55% syrup (HFCS 55), about as sweet as sucrose.
<p>The food processing industry is always anxious to reduce costs for 
maximum profit. Corn syrup is very cheap due to government subsidy of 
corn farming. High Fructose Corn Syrup is sweeter than regular corn 
syrup so less needs to be used.</p>
<p>Soft drink manufacturers now use HFCS in beverages that were once 
sweetened with cane sugar. Many consumers prefer cane sugar and pay higher 
prices for the same beverage smuggled in from Mexico where cane sugar is 
still used. The beverage industry has responded not by selling consumers 
what they want but by attempting to stop importation by any means, legal 
or questionably legal.</p>
<p>Health aspects of HFCS have been controversial. Some have claimed it 
increases obesity and diabetes.. The industry, and dietitians under its 
influence, have claimed it's no worse than any other sugar in that respect 
and overall sugar consumption should be blamed. New studies by the  
University of California and Princeton University both point to HFCS 
being more dangerous than other sugars. See the 
<a href="sweet.html#hfcs">Health and Nutrition</a> section for details.</p>

<h2>Date Sugar</h2>
<br>Made by granulating dried dates, this is used as a "finishing sugar" 
for toppings, pastries and fruit. It remains granular rather than 
dissolving easily like other sugars so cannot be used as a substitute 
for them.<p></p>

<h2 id="gold">Golden Syrup</h2> 
<br><img src="img/gr_goldn02k.jpg" alt="Small dish of Golden Syrup" class=mrg>
[Partially Inverted Refiners Syrup]
<p>This is made from a sugar syrup (sucrose) that is a byproduct of sugar 
refining. It is partially broken down into  <a href="sweet.html#invert"><b>Invert 
Sugar</b></a> consisting of 50% sucrose and the rest fructose and glucose. 
This sugar syrup will not crystalize, making it desirable for bakers. It has 
the color and viscosity of honey. Invented by a Chemist at Abram Lyle &amp; 
Sons and first marketed in 1885, it is still made at the Tate and Lyle 
refinery in East London - but the brand is now owned by ASR Group (American 
Sugar Refiners).</p>
<p>A very similar product can be made in the home by dissolving 4 cups of 
sugar in 1-1/4 cups of Water, bringing to a boil and stirring gently. Then 
stir in 2 Tablespoons of Lemon Juice (or 1/2 t Citric Acid) and cook 
uncovered over very low heat, without stirring, until it takes on a honey 
color.</p>

<h2>Gur</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Jaggery, gur (India)]
 - Gur is synonymous with <a href="sweet.html#jag"><b>Jaggery</b></a>.
<p></p>

<h2 id="honey">Honey</h2>
<br><img src="img/sw_honey02h.jpg" alt="Honeycomb" class=mrg>
Zillions of bees visit hundreds of zillions of flowers and suck the nectar 
out of them (which is there to attract pollinating bees).
<p>When they return to their hive they barf it up into wax cells where 
it is mixed with antiseptic substances secreted by the insects, properly 
dehydrated and then capped. Bees are absurdly industrious and 
manufacture far more honey than they actually need.</p>
<p>Beekeepers break into the beehives and remove most of the wax 
"honeycombs" as rent for living in a beehive provided by the beekeeper 
and conveniently prefitted with wax honeycomb bases ready to start 
filling. It's not all that hard on the bees, they really don't have much 
else to do anyway.</p>
<p>Honey varies in flavor depending on the kind of flowers that 
predominate in the area, such as sage and orange blossom honey which 
can be sold at gourmet prices.</p>
<p>Purely natural honey is minimally processed, basically just drained 
off the wax (and sometimes not even that), Most commercial honey, however, 
has been filtered and pasteurized and some of its health benefits may 
have been destroyed. In either case, it's still about 80% sugar and 17% 
water. The main sugars are fructose (38%), glucose (31%), maltose (7%) 
and sucrose (1%), so its sugar profile is slightly better than High 
Fructose Corn Syrup. Whether natural fructose is metabolically different 
from artificial fructose is subject to debate. Honey contains a number of 
vitamins, minerals and proteins but in far too small a quantity to be 
nutritionally significant. It also contains acids, hydrogen peroxide and 
other anti-bacterial substances.</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; A large amount of honey sold in North America 
is from China, and very often it's origin has been concealed by 
"laundering". Chinese honey is noted for contamination with lead 
(apparently China's favorite mineral) and the antibiotic chloramphenicol, 
banned by the FDA, as well as other foreign substances. Much Chinese 
honey is cut with sugars and some is completely fake. If you buy 
processed foods touting "with natural honey" you are likely getting 
Chinese honey, because it costs the processors less. Importation of 
Asian honey is banned in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="invert">Invert Sugar</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Trimoline, Golden Syrup]
<br>Cane sugar (sucrose) processed to break sucrose molecules into one 
glucose and one fructose molecule. This gives the sugar a sweeter, "more 
rounded" flavor, and it won't crystalize, preferred by bakers. 
<a href="sweet.html#gold"><b>Golden Syrup</b></a> is a partially converted syrup.
<p></p>

<h2 id="jag">Jaggery</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [jaggery, gur (India), 
  nam taan oi (Thai)]
<br><img src="img/sw_jaggery04c.jpg" alt="Jaggery" class=mrg>
An unprocessed sugar, generally cane sugar but sometimes palm sugar, 
much used in India and Southeast Asia. It will be cane sugar unless 
marked "palm jaggery" because palm is generally more expensive. The flavor 
of cane jaggery is between dark sugar and molasses. See also 
<a href="sweet.html#palm">Palm Sugar</a>.
<p>Jaggery is commonly molded into blunt cones as in the photo, which may 
be anywhere from a few ounces to 10 pounds. Other shapes are also sometimes 
found. Subst: Mexican <a href="sweet.html#pilon">Piloncillo</a> (closest) or dark 
brown sugar.<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Malt Syrup - Asian</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Mulyeot (Korea); Mizuame 
  (Japan) - Maltose]
<br><a href="sw_maltsz.html">
<img src="img/sw_malts01k.jpg" alt="Malt Syrup" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This syrup is not to be confused with the dark heavy malt syrup used 
by brewers and bakers in North America. It is easily available in Korean 
markets, in both clear and amber varieties. It has the same consistency 
as honey, and the amber has a similar, but much lighter, flavor. They 
are about 1/3 as sweet as honey or sugar. Even the amber is much lighter 
than <a href="sw_ricesz.html"><b>Ssalyeot</b></a> (rice syrup) which is 
100% malted rice.</p>
<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; The closest American substitute is Corn Syrup. 
Not the "High Fructose" variety, but plain corn syrup, like Karo Light. 
The malt flavor of the amber malt syrup won't be there, and Corn Syrup 
is significantly sweeter, but it will work for sweetness and glaze.

<h2 id="maple">Maple Syrup</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Sucrose]
<br><img src="img/sb_maples01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Maple Syrup" class=mrg>
<p>
Maple syrup is a sweetener made by boiling down the sap of a hardwood 
tree of the soapberry family, the Maple (<i>Acer</i>). Maple syrup finds 
wide use  for pouring on breakfast pancakes and as a flavoring ingredient 
in baked goods and candies. The sap is produced only in very cold forest 
areas, mainly Vermont and Canada, both of which claim their maple syrup is 
better than the other. The production season generally lasts for 6 weeks 
in the Spring.</p>
<p>Maple Syrup grades are established by the USDA. Canada adheres to 
similar grading but uses different names. These are not quality grades. 
There are no cheap Chinese sugar maples so we presume all the trees are 
of the highest quality (but fake maple syrups are made). These are usage 
grades, and the makers have little control as to what grades they'll get 
in any particular year, that's pretty much up to the trees.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grade A Light Amber</b> is the lightest grade and has the mildest 
maple flavor. It's usually made early in the season when the weather is 
colder. This grade is preferred for making maple cream and maple candy.</li>
<li><b>Grade A Medium Amber</b> is somewhat darker, and the maple flavor is 
a little more intense. This is the most popular table syrup grade. It usually 
is made about mid-season when the weather warms a bit.</li>
<li><b>Grade A Dark Amber</b> is the darkest grade commonly used as table 
syrup and is normally made late in the season.</li>
<li><b>Grade B</b> is often called Cooking Syrup and is made late in the 
season. It is very dark with a strong maple flavor, but some prefer it as 
table syrup for just that reason. Most use it for baking, and flavoring 
foods.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="mol">Molasses</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Treacle (British)]
<br><img src="img/gr_sugmol01k.jpg" alt="Dish of Molasses" class=mrg>
<p>
Molasses is a black sticky byproduct of refining sugar. At one time it 
was the standard sweetener in the U.S. (now replaced by High Fructose Corn 
Syrup) so many older recipes call for it. If no qualifiers are given, 
presume it's "dark molasses". Cane sugar is refined in several boilings, 
each with its byproducts.
<p>In Colonial times, Molasses was very common in New England, because 
it was part of the "Triangle Trade". African slaves were brought to the 
Caribbean to grow and harvest sugar cane. Molasses was shipped to New 
England, where it was distilled into Rum. This was traded in various 
ways to afford more slaves to take to the Caribbean to grow more sugar 
cane.
<br class=cll></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Unsulfured Molasses</b> is made from sun ripened cane.
<br><b>Sulfured Molasses</b> is made from green cane treated with sulphur 
fumes.</li>
<li><b>First</b> or <b>Light Molasses</b> is a light colored product from the 
first boiling or the cane squeezings and has a high sugar content.</li>
<li><b>Second</b> or <b>Dark Molasses</b> is from the second boiling. Less sweet 
with just a touch of bitterness.</li>
<li><b>Blackstrap Molasses</b> comes from further boilings, is less sweet and 
more bitter. Blackstrap molasses somehow became a "health food" icon even 
though it may concentrate all the impurities and pesticides from the sugar 
cane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monk Fruit</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  [Luo han guo (China); La han qua 
  (Viet); longevity fruit (not unique); <i>Fructus Momordicae</i> 
  (Pharm); <i>Siraitia grosvenorii</i>]
<br><a href="gd_monkz.html">
<img src="img/gd_monk07h.jpg" alt="Monk Fruit, Dried, Split" class=mrg></a>
Native to southern China and northern Thailand, this gourd is related 
to the <a href="gd_bittz.html">Bitter Gourds</a>, but genus 
<i>Siraitia</i>, not <i>Momordica</i>). This fruit has recently become 
much better known in the West. Extracts from this fruit are 300 times 
sweeter than cane sugar, with almost no calories. The US FDA (Food and 
Drug Administration) has recently rated the fruit and extracts from it 
as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), so they can be included as natural 
sweeteners in any number of products. This sweetener has not yet been 
shown to have the serious negative effects of artificial sweeteners, 
but sufficient studies looking for those have yet to be conducted..
<p>This sweetener has not yet been shown to have the serious negative 
effects of artificial sweeteners, but sufficient studies looking for 
those have yet to be conducted. The fruits grow on vines and are 
between 2 to 2-3/4 inches diameter with sweet, fleshy edible pulp 
and many seeds. <a href="gd_monkz.html"><b>Details and Cooking</b></a>.

<h2>Palm Honey</h2>
<br>Palm sap boiled down to a honey like consistency. See 
<a href="sweet.html#palm"><b>Palm Sugar</b></a> for details.
<p></p>

<h2 id="palm">Palm Sugar</h2>
<br><img src="img/sw_palm05c.jpg" alt="Palm Sugar" class=mrg>
A number of <a href="pm_palm.html#sugar">Palms</a> are used to make 
palm sugar. Immature flower buds are pounded and cut to exude a sweet sap 
(sweet toddy) which is collected and boiled down to sugar of various 
consistencies. It is most available in the U.S. as small cakes sold in markets 
serving a Southeast Asian communities and in Indian markets as "Palm Gur" or 
"Palm Jaggery".
<p>This is a very light and flavorful sugar with a lot more 
nutrients left in it than most sugars and is very important in the cuisine 
of Thailand. It is commonly available in the U.S. but if you don't have it 
substitute equal parts of light brown sugar and maple syrup.</p>

<h2 id="pilon">Piloncillo</h2> (variously spelled)
<br><img src="img/sw_pilonciello05c.jpg" alt="Pilonciello" class=mrg>
Mexican Jaggery. It comes in two varieties, light (blanco) and darker 
(oscuro). The loaves are generally pointier and smaller than the product 
from India, weighing between 3/4 ounce and 9 ounces. Similar products are 
made in other Central and South American countries and It's easy to find in 
any grocery that serves a Latin community. Subst: <a href="sweet.html#jag">Jaggery</a> 
(closest) or dark brown sugar (close enough for government work).
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Rice Syrup</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Ssalyeot (Korea); Brown Rice 
  Syrup - Maltose]
<br><a href="sw_ricesz.html">
<img src="img/sw_rices02k.jpg" alt="Dish of Rice Syrup" class=mrg></a>
<p>
This syrup is available in most Korean markets, at least here in 
Los Angeles. Preferably it will be labeled "100% rice" with no other 
ingredients. It has the same consistency as honey but with a lighter 
flavor, and is about 1/3 as sweet as honey or sugar. It has more malt 
flavor than <a href="sw_maltsz.html"><b>Mulyeot</b></a> (malt syrup) 
which is made somewhat differently. Health Food outlets now sell 
"Brown Rice Syrup", mostly from California rice grower Lundberg Farms, 
which is similarly made.</p>
<p><b>Subst:</b> &nbsp; The amber Mulyeot (malt syrup) would be closest, 
just a little lighter flavor. The Lundberg product would be the closest 
American substitute, and next closest is is Corn Syrup. Not the "High 
Fructose" variety, but plain corn syrup, like Karo Light. The malt flavor 
will be missing, and Corn Syrup is significantly sweeter, but it will 
work for sweetness and glaze.

<h2 id="rock">Rock Sugar</h2>
  &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Rock Candy; Misri (India)]
<br><img src="img/sw_sugra02k.jpg" alt="Lumps of Amber Rock Sugar" class=mrg>
<p>
This is regular cane sugar crystalized from a supersaturated solution. 
It originates from Persia and India and comes in various natural and 
artificial colors. Naturally, it comes in Brown, Amber and White, 
depending on the degree of refinement of the original sugar. In China, 
the Amber is the preferred form for use in recipes. In India, the 
White is usually preferred. In several countries, a piece of rock sugar 
is often dropped into the bottom of a cup of tea to slowly dissolve. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sorghum">Sorghum Syrup</h2>
<br><img src="img/gn_sorghum10c.jpg" alt="Sorghum" class=mrg>
Sorghum Syrup is made from sorghum grain, the seed of a grass grown 
worldwide as a major food crop. For syrup a particular cultivar known 
as "sweet sorghum" is used.
<p>Sorghum syrup has long been used in the American South for pouring 
over pancakes, biscuits and corn bread and as a flavoring ingredient much 
as maple syrup has been used up north.  This usage has become much less 
common now that artificial maple syrup and other sweeteners have become 
widely available. It has, however, recently started gaining popularity, 
and there are now some boutique producers of high quality syrup.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="stev">Stevia</h2> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Sweetleaf, Sugarleaf; <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>]
<br><img src="img/dy_stevia04e.jpg" alt="Stevia Plant" class=mrg>
<p>
A Paraguayan herb the leaves of which are extremely sweet. An extract 
from the leaves is hundreds of times sweeter than table sugar, has 
almost no calories and is safe for diabetics. It has been widely used in 
Japan for 30 years to replace artificial chemical sweeteners.
<p>Until 1998 it was not approved as a sweetener in the U.S., Canada, the 
European Union, Australia or New Zealand. Under FDA regulations it was legal 
to own and even sell stevia, but in doing so you had to call it a 
"dietary supplement" and not even mention that it was "sweet". This is still 
the case in Canada and Europe (except France), but it is now approved as a 
sweetener in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>This regulation was not be entirely due to pressure from the sugar and 
chemical industries. While it has proved safe in South America and Japan, 
the FDA pointed out it is  used sparingly there and worried that obsessive 
American dieters would use it to excess, as they do with every other diet 
fad that comes along.</p>
<p>This sweetener has not yet been shown to have the serious negative 
effects of artificial sweeteners, but sufficient studies looking for 
those have yet to be conducted. Some negative reproductive effects have 
been noted from feeding rats and hamsters heavy doses, so they say more 
research is warranted. Of course the danger is probably much less than 
for approved <a href="sweet.html#art">Artificial Sweeteners</a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Syrup</h2>
<br>Any sugar solution or sweetener that is viscous but remains liquid 
and pourable. <b>Simple Syrup</b> is just regular refined sugar cooked 
with some water.<p></p>

<h2>Treacle</h2>
<br>Now mostly a British term, it technically is any syrup made during the 
production of sugar from sugar cane. In current usage "Light Treacle" 
refers to <a href="sweet.html#gold">Golden Syrup</a> and "Black Treacle" refers to 
<a href="sweet.html#mol">Dark Molasses</a>.<p></p>

<p>Starches and sugars are carbohydrates manufactured by plants as energy 
storage. They can be converted one to the other and in some cases are 
further converted into oils. In the case of fruits, that energy is stored 
for animals the plant depends on to distribute its seeds (most plants 
don't travel much). In the case of nuts, seeds and grains, the storage 
is for the use of the plant's own progeny.</p>

<p>Plants convert from one form to another for various reasons. Generally 
when its seeds are fully mature a fruit will "ripen", converting starches 
to sugars to attract seed distributing animals, many of which are partial 
to sweet treats.</p>

<p>We inherited this taste for sweet things from our distant ancestors. 
The problem is, sugars were rare and hard to get for them. Today they are 
easily available and cheap, especially in refined form. We tend to eat 
far too much sugar and in refined forms that our ancestors did not 
consume. This over consumption is not good for our health.</p>

<p>The food industry is not particularly interested in our health but is 
very interested in our willingness to over-consume sweet things, because 
we pay them to obtain those things.</p>

<h2>Fructose</h2>

<p>This sugar is found mainly in fruit. Nutrition researchers have found 
it is metabolized somewhat differently from other sugars, putting heavier 
load on the liver and pancreas. Eating a reasonable amount of fresh fruit 
is considered very good for health, but it can apparently be overdone. 
Juices are particularly bad because they are in a concentrated, processed 
and unnatural form. Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs was a frutarian much 
of his life, drinking large amounts of fruit juices. He died of a type 
of pancreatic cancer that is quite rare, but most common in frutarians. 
This is not proof, but a strong indication that moderation and 
unprocessed foods are the best policy.</p>

<h2 id="hfcs">High Fructose Corn Syrup</h2> 
&nbsp; - &nbsp; [HFCS (US); Isoglucose (UK), Glucose/fructose (Canada)]
<p></p>

<p>High Fructose Corn Syrup is an industrial product produced by a complex 
process involving genetically modified enzymes, fungus, hydrochloric acid 
and caustic soda, and is made from (mostly) genetically modified corn.</p>

<p>A significant number of nutritionists consider HFCS more dangerous than 
other sugars and note an increase in childhood obesity and diabetes that 
parallels the increase in HFCS use in soft drinks, sweets and processed 
foods. The corn processing industry has denied any connection and blames 
high overall sugar consumption (which they promote).</p>

<p>A recent study completed in 2009 by the University of California, the first 
using human test subjects, has come down hard on the side of HFCS and fructose 
in general being seriously more dangerous (<a href="sweet.html#s5"><b>S5</b></a>). The 
corn processing industry has denounced the study as nonsense (without 
presenting any evidence). The study was fairly small so larger studies are 
warranted.</p>

<p>An even newer study from Princeton University backs up the UC study's 
conclusions (<a href="sweet.html#s7"><b>S7</b></a>), so it now appears fully 
warranted to avoid products containing HFCS as much as possible.</p>

<p>What is NOT controversial among health professionals is that Americans 
should greatly reduce the total amount of sugars they consume. The food 
industry, of course, gives lip service to this concept while vigorously 
promoting heavily sweetened products.</p>
