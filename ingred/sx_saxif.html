<h1>Saxifrages</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The order <i>Saxifragales</i> stands with <i>Rosids</i> and 
<i>Astrids</i> among the core eudicots. Saxifrages were once far more 
widespread than they are in recent times, which is probably not a bad 
thing. Unlike <i>Rosids</i> and <i>Astrids</i> which provide a vast 
number of food products for human consumption, the Saxifrages provide 
precious little. One family (<i>Crassulaceae</i>) is, however very 
popular as interesting, low maintenance and highly decorative succulents.

<h2>Gooseberries <small>&amp;</small> Currants</h2>

<p>[genus <i>Ribes</i>] &nbsp; What is a gooseberry and what is a currant 
is rather unclear - it's mainly a matter of tradition. There are many 
wild species of Ribes, even many here in California (a few go as far 
south as the Mexican border), and most produce edible berries, but the 
ones listed here are those in substantial cultivation for culinary use.
</p>

   <h2>Gooseberry</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_gooseb02e.jpg" alt="Dish of Ripe Gooseberries" class=mrg>
   [<i>Ribes hirtellum</i> (North American) | <i>Ribes uva-crispa</i> 
   (European / Asian) and other species]
   <p>
   Native to North America (<i>R. hirtellum</i>) Europe, southwestern 
   Asia (<i>R. uva-crispa</i>), these straggling spiny bushes produce 
   berries that are rather tart. They are usually used to make jams and 
   deserts where the tartness is tempered by sugar, but in Portugal and 
   some other regions they are used in beverages. Gooseberry production 
   is almost entirely within Europe, with Russia the largest producer.
   </p>
   <p> The photo specimens, identifiable as <i>R. hirtellum</i> as there 
   are no bristles on the fruit and from the mix of green and red, were 
   up to 0.66 inches diameter and weighed 15 to the ounce on average. 
   These were obtained at the absurd price of nearly US $1 per ounce 
   from Whole Foods Market. At that pricing you certainly aren't going 
   to make much jam, and that makes them nothing more than a curiosity 
   for yuppies.
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Blackcurrant</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_blkcurr02h.jpg" alt="Ripe Blackcurrant Berries" class=mrg>
   [Cassis, gadellier noir (French); Schwarze Johannisbeere (German); 
   <i>Ribes nigrum</i>]
   <p>
   This small shrub (3 to 5 feet high) is native to central and northern 
   Europe and northern Asia. The fruit is a berry about 1/2 inch in 
   diameter and a mature bush can produce up to 10 pounds during a 
   summer.</p>
   <p>Blackcurrent syrup was the main source of vitamin C in the UK 
   during World War II and has remained a popular flavoring for beverages, 
   particularly "Cider &amp; Black" and to enhance the flavor of Guinness.
   Outside the UK it is much used for jams and to flavor many confections 
   and ice cream as well as liqueurs. In Russia the leaves are also used 
   as a flavoring in teas, preserves and vodka. Black current is also 
   used as a flavoring for many sauces used with meat, often by including 
   jam or jelly.</p>
   <p>Commercial production is almost entirely within Europe, with Russia 
   the top  producer. Production was banned in the United States for 
   almost the entirety of the 20th century, due to fear of white pine 
   blister rust, but production is now legal in a number of states and 
   increasing in New York, Connecticut, Vermont and Oregon. The photo 
   specimens were from Lithuania, purchased frozen from a large 
   multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (Sunland).   
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Redcurrant</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_currantr02h.jpg" alt="Dish of Ripe Redcurrant Berries" class=mrg>
   [Red Currant; Johannisbeeren (Germany); <i>Ribes rubrum</i>]
   <p>
   Native to parts of Western and Central Europe and as far south as northern 
   Spain and Italy, this shrub grows to 3 to 5 feet high and can produce up 
   to 8 pounds of berries in the mid to late summer. Fruit size ranges from 
   0.31 to 0.47 inches diameter. Commercial production is almost entirely 
   within Europe, with Russia the top producer. I presume that in the United 
   States it was subjected to the same ban as for black current. The photo 
   specimens, the largest about 0.4 inches diameter, were California grown 
   and purchased at a certified farmer's market in Pasadena, CA - at the 
   outrageous cost of US $1.25 per ounce.</p>
   <p>Fresh ripe redcurrants are tart-sweet weighted well to the tart side. 
   They may be served raw in salads or as garnishes but most of the production 
   goes to making jams and jellies. In the UK these are served as a condiment 
   with lamb, and may also be included in sauces. In Scandinavia these 
   berries are used in fruit soups.   
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Whitecurrant</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_currantw01h.jpg" alt="Ripe Whitecurrant Berries on Bush" class=mrg>
   [<i>Ribes glandulosum</i>]
   <p>
   This is an albino cultivar of the Red Currant rather than a separate 
   species, but is somewhat smaller and sweeter. It is used, sometimes 
   along with red currents, to make products that are supposed to have a 
   "refined" image. Whitecurrant berries are also often 
   used raw to provide a sweet-tart flavor.

   <h2>Zante Currant</h2>
   <br><img src="img/gp_zante01h.jpg" alt="Dried Zante Currant" class=mrg>
   [raisins de Corinthe sec (French); <i>Vitis vinifera</i>]
   <p>
   These are not actually currants but tiny sweet black seedless grapes 
   dried into raisins. When a recipe, usually a baking recipe, calls for 
   "currants" with no further description, this is what is meant. Dried 
   blackcurrants do exist in Europe but even there are uncommon. 
   California distributors like Sun-Maid call these raisins 
   "zante currants", but in the UK they're called just "currants". Here 
   in California the fresh grapes, both black and white, are sold as 
   "Champaign grapes" (after the bubbles - they aren't used to make 
   Champaign wine).
   <br class=cll></p>

   <h2>Jostaberry</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_jost01h.jpg" alt="Ripe Jostaberrues on Shrub" class=mrg>
   [<i>Ribes x nidigrolaria</i>]
   <p>
   Pronounced "Yostberry" this is the result of a complex cross breeding of 
   several Ribes species performed in Germany. It is midway between gooseberry 
   and blackcurrant in size. When not quite ripe it is much like gooseberry and 
   becomes more currant like when fully ripe. It is propagated by 
   cuttings and is currently available as a garden fruit plant, most commonly 
   in the UK. It is not currently used for commercial products.

   <h2>Currant Jams &amp; Jellies</h2>
   <br><img src="img/sx_jam01h.jpg" alt="Dish of Red and Black Current Jellies" class=mrg>
   [<i>Ribes</i> species]
   <p>
   Currant jams and jellies are often called for in European recipes as an 
   ingredient in sauces or as topping or filling for baked goods. Here in 
   North America they aren't always easy to find when you need them. 
   Fortunately, sealed in their jars, they have very good shelf life. If a 
   jar should get a little mold on top, just spoon it off, discard and use 
   the rest. To the left in the photo is blackcurrant preserve and to the 
   right redcurrant jelly. <u>Subst</u>: sour cherry 
   jam or jelly is a reasonable, though not exact, substitute.

<h2>Jade Plant</h2>
<br><img src="img/sx_jade10e.jpg" alt="Live Jade Plant" class=mrg>
[Friendship Tree; Rubber Tree (Eric Knight); <i>Crassula ovata</i> of 
family <i>Crassulaceae</i>]
<p>
Native to South Africa, this plant is not actually considered edible, but 
I have so many of them growing here, completely without care or 
maintenance even in the heat of a Southern California summer, I figured 
they deserve a place on the Saxifrage page. Wikipedia says, "notoriously 
easy to propagate". No kidding! Keeping them from taking over the world 
is a bit more difficult. Leaves and branches break off very easily, and 
within a few days will have rooted and started a new plant.
