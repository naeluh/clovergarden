<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> History</h2>

<p><img src="img/bd_turk08k.jpg" alt="Wild Turkey" class=mrg>
The turkey is a North and Central American bird. Different varieties were 
domesticated in the American Southwest and in southern Mexico at least 2000 
years ago. Initially they were for ceremonial use and for feathers, but 
around the year 1000 CE game became scarce and they became food.</p>
<p>The North American line of domesticated turkeys is now extinct and our 
Thanksgiving turkeys are descended from those carefully bred by the Aztecs 
in Mexico for plumpness and flavor. The photo, (&copy; 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0040</a>) is of a North American wild 
turkey tom (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>).</p>

<p>When these domesticated birds were introduced to Europe they completely 
displaced the less tasty peacock for important banquets well before the 
Pilgrims sailed. There was, however, great confusion in Europe as to where 
turkeys came from. In French they're blamed on India and in English they 
may be named for the country of Turkey but there are other theories. 
</p>

<p>Historians say if turkeys were served by Pilgrims they were likely 
Mexican turkeys, some of which may have been brought over in 1620. Mexican 
turkeys had been introduced to Europe 100 years before and by then would 
have been considered normal supplies. In their natural habitat wild 
turkeys are extremely difficult to bag even with modern hunting gear, 
never mind the primitive stuff Pilgrims would have had. Their ability to 
elude hunters has been described as "near to genius".</p>

<p>Since the story of the First Thanksgiving was made up entirely 
from scratch during the Lincoln administration (1863) we don't know for 
sure if Pilgrims even ate turkey. The real "First Thanksgiving" upon which 
our "tradition" is based was more of an out-of-control beer bash than a 
religious event. If you don't believe that, ask the Smithsonian, they have 
the details.</p>

<p>Today North American wild turkeys have increased from a low of as few as 
30,000 to millions and have adjusted to suburban living. Having learned that 
it's illegal to shoot them in suburbia they're becoming pests like raccoons 
and deer. Toms, which can stand as high as 4 feet and run at 20 miles per 
hour (and yes, they can fly) are even fighting it out face to face with 
humans for territorial domination.</p>


<h2 id="breed" class=lrg>Types <small>of</small> Turkey</h2>

<p>The main question people ask is: "Is it a tom or a hen?". <b>Toms</b> 
are thought by some cooks to be tastier than hens. Other cooks say there 
isn't a noticeable difference and that's the stance taken by the poultry 
industry. <b>Hens</b> are thought by some cooks to have a higher 
proportion of light meat to dark. Again others say not, no matter how 
many bibles the believer swears upon. Basically, in any batch of turkeys, 
the hens will be the smaller ones and the toms will be the larger ones. 
Aside from weight, don't worry about it.</p>

<h3>Large White</h3> -or- <h3>Broad Breasted White</h3> 
is your supermarket turkey. It is not actually a breed because each major 
producer has created slightly different birds and keeps its own cross 
breeding secret. All are good "factory turkeys", fast growing and 
tolerant of crowded conditions. They are meaty and economical to purchase 
but not particularly flavorful. Breeders have grown toms to around 100 
pounds.<p></p>

<h3>Standard Bronze</h3> is an "heirloom" turkey widely grown on family 
farms until the 1930s. It is now a favorite with boutique growers of 
"free range" and "organic free range" turkeys. At least one farm even has 
a "turkey cam" so you can watch your thanksgiving dinner and his/her pals 
at work and play until the day it's shipped to you Overnight Express. 
You need to reserve these in advance and it's going to set you back 
around $150 for a 16 pound turkey. Of course your average celebrity 
chef will have nothing less.<p></p>

<h3>Bourbon Red</h3> is another "heirloom" turkey that has had its 15 
minutes of fame among the celebrity chefs. It is grown and marketed 
similarly to the Standard Bronze.<p></p>

<h3>Beltsville Small White</h3> is a breed developed to provide a 
"family size" turkey, considerably smaller than the Standard Bronze and 
other turkeys of its day. White feathers were selected for the pale skin 
preferred by consumers. Today this breed is pretty much extinct but lives 
on as the base breeding stock used to develop the Large White of today's 
commerce.<p></p>

<h2>Ocellated Turkey</h2>
<br><img src="img/bd_turko01e.jpg" alt="Ocellated Turkey" class=mrg>
[Pavo, Pavo Ocelado (Spanish); Ucutz il Chican (Mayan); 
<i>Meleagris ocellata</i>]
<p>
This wild turkey only lives in Southern Mexico, Belize and part of 
Guatemala. They are relatively small with hens topping out at 8 pounds and 
toms at 12 pounds. They're listed as "NT" (Near Threatened) which is a lot 
better than many birds and animals are doing these days.
