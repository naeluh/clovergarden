<p><span class=bg>
While it may not please Norman Rockwell fans, our method 
for presenting and carving a turkey is more practical. Few Americans are 
practiced turkey carvers these days, and, as one expert turkey chef 
put it, carving from the bird is awkward and "only looks good on TV".

<h2 id="gen">Objective</h2>

<p>The objective is to cut the turkey up into neat serving pieces, 
presenting it attractively, distributing the skin uniformly while keeping 
it crisp, and above all, avoiding making an awful mess and a fool of 
yourself.</p>

<p>Carving at the table is not a good idea. A big reason is that if you 
screw up you're going to do it right in front of everyone. Another is 
the traditional table method of slicing the breasts puts most of the skin on 
the first slice and little for anyone else, and sliced in that direction 
the breast meat tends to break up. Yet another reason to carve in the 
kitchen is you get to nibble on prize bits of turkey before anyone else 
gets any. If you aren't convinced by now, well, it's your party so go 
for it.</p>

<p>Don't expect to get your slices "gourmet magazine" perfect - for those 
photos they refrigerate the turkey and carve it dead cold. Much more 
manageable that way, but if your objective is eating nice warm turkey 
fresh from the oven you'll have to accept less precision.</p> 

<h2 id="equip">Equipment</h2>

<p>You're going to need a long, ultra-sharp carving knife. A 10 inch blade 
is best for turkey but you're unlikely to find any longer than 8 inches at 
your local kitchen store so that will have to do if you haven't ordered in 
advance. Alternatively, you can use a good quality electric knife. This is 
particularly helpful if you are not expert with a knife, or if you need 
to slice very thin.</p>

<p>A boning knife is helpful for disjointing, and a carving fork with two 
long tines can be useful for keeping a slippery turkey stable while you 
cut it, or you can just grasp it. A good cutting board is, of course, 
essential.</p>

<h2 id="show">Presentation</h2>

<p><img src="img/sv_turk104c.jpg" alt="turkey" class=mrg> 
When your turkey comes out of the oven, allow it to drain for a few 
minutes. Catch any juices for addition to your gravy stock (if you are 
making gravy). Place the turkey on a platter and set it out for all to 
admire. If you know a bag piper you can parade the turkey through the 
dining room.</p> 
<p>Now, tent it loosely with aluminum foil because it has to rest for 
<b>at least 30 minutes</b> or it'll be difficult to carve and be a 
mess. Everyone must be told not to touch it and there must be no dogs 
allowed in the house.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="carve">Carving</h2>

<p><img src="img/sv_turk119c.jpg" alt="Platter of Carved Turkey" class=mrg>
A major objective when carving is to keep the bird upright 
and <i>keep the skin from contacting liquids</i> as much as possible so it stays 
crisp.</p> 

<p>Sharpen your carving knife until it is razor sharp (or plug in your 
electric carving knife).</p>

<p>When the turkey is properly rested,<u>and not before</u>, bring the 
platter into the kitchen and offload the turkey to your cutting board. 
Clean the platter to receive the carved turkey slices and pieces.</p>

<p>Remove as much stuffing as you can from the bird, put it in a bowl. Warm 
it up for serving when needed.</p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve03c.jpg" alt="Cutting Away Wings" class=mrg>
Start with the wings. Bend them out until you can cut them away from the 
breasts, then bend them far enough out to dislocate the joint so you can get 
your knife point into the joint to cut it loose. Set the wings aside 
keeping the skin dry.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve04c.jpg" alt="Cutting Away Legs" class=mrg>
Next the legs. Grab a leg by the knee and pull it far enough out to 
dislocate  the joint with the body. Get the point of your knife into the 
joint and cut the thigh and leg loose. Set the legs aside keeping the skin 
dry.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve05c.jpg" alt="Cutting Away the Breasts" class=mrg>
You want to remove the breast whole. Start by making a cut lengthwise 
right against the keel. Keep it upright - it's shown tilted here just for 
clarity. Now, pulling the breast away from the body as you cut, free the 
breast meat from the keel and ribs, being careful to bring as much meat 
as possible in one big lump, and being careful to disturb the skin as 
little as possible. Set the breasts cut side down to keep the skin dry.
<br class=cll></p>

<p>Wrap the carcass and put 
it in the refrigerator for future reference. More meat will be recovered 
from it later and it will be used to make soup stock.</p> 

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve06c.jpg" alt="Slicing the Breasts" class=mrg>
Set a breast on the cutting board cut side down and slice it crosswise 
like a loaf of bread but at an angle so it looks good on the platter. Try 
to slice with a single stroke of the knife but if more than one stroke is 
needed <u>make them all in the same direction</u>. Sawing will break up 
the meat a lot more. Arrange the slices on the platter (see illustration) 
and adjust any slices of skin that have gone askew. You should be able to 
move the platter close to the board and pick up the whole breast at once. Do the other 
breast and place it in the opposite direction.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve07c.jpg" alt="Slice the Thighs" class=mrg>
Cut the thighs from the legs at the knee joint. Slice the thighs with 
the grain (parallel to the bone) and arrange the slices on the platter 
leaving the bone behind. Dark meat does break up a lot more than white, 
so be prepared for that.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve09c.jpg" alt="Slice the Legs" class=mrg>
Cut shallow slices off the legs until you're down to tendons. Put the 
leg bones with remaining meat and tendons with the carcass for attention 
later.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/turkeycarve08c.jpg" alt="Cut the Wings" class=mrg>
Cut the wing joints apart. The inner joint can be treated like the 
thigh or left whole. The outer joint is best left whole, along with the 
wing tip if it has been left on.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Serve</h2>
<br><img src="img/sv_turk119c.jpg" alt="Carved Turkey Arranged for Serving" class=mrg>
Return leftovers to the refrigerator as soon as possible.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2 id="next">Next Day</h2>

<p>Pull the carcass and the bones out of the refrigerator. Cut away every 
bit of remaining meat that can be removed in useful hunks - and that'll 
be even pretty small pieces if you use them for soup.</p>

<p>Chop up the stripped carcass and put it with the bones and all other 
remaining bits, including any bits of stuffing, into a suitable 
pot. Add water, bring to a simmer and simmer for two or three hours to 
make a tasty soup stock. Strain the stock and remove the fat (use your 
gravy separator). Let any debris settle, then pour the soup off the 
debris.</p>

<p>You can freeze the stock if you will not be using it within the 
next couple of days, but here's the method I use (because my freezer 
compartment is always crammed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare clean heat resistant jars and well fitting lids (the best 
  lids have a dimple in the center). I use pickle or sauerkraut jars and 
  the like.</li>
<li>Put the cleaned and defatted stock in a sauce pan and bring it to a 
  boil uncovered (so you can see when it's boiling and so it won't foam 
  over on the stove).</li>
<li>Take it off the heat and put the lid on. Let it sit just a few 
  minutes so it doesn't shock the jars too bad, but is still at a 
  sterilizing temperature (190 &deg;F/90&deg;C).</li>
<li>Pour the stock into the jars. These should be sized so they are 
  very full. Put the lids on tight.</li>
<li>Leave out on the counter until they completely cooled. If you have 
  dimpled lids you will here the snap down. Otherwise check that they 
  are sucked down tight with no spring.</li>
<li>Put the jars in the fridge. I don't know how long they will keep 
  without spoiling because I discard any that are a year old.</li>
  </ol>
