<h1>Turkey Gravy</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Doing a turkey the traditional way means making gravy.  Many modern 
dinner plans do not require gravy, but to do the whole traditional 
shazam it's expected, and it's tricky - failed gravy is a hallowed 
tradition in many families. It isn't really that hard, though, if you go 
about it systematically. This is a companion page for our complete 
instructions for <a href="turkeyroast.html"><b>Roasting a Turkey</b></a>.

<h2 id="gen">General Discussion</h2>

<p><b>If at all possible</b> have a second person responsible for the 
gravy so you can tend to the potatoes, vegetables or what have you.

<p>There are a number of procedures all of which will produce about the 
same result if done correctly. The procedure given here is, I feel, 
particularly reliable for persons who make gravy just once or twice a 
year.</p>

<p>Thickeners other than flour based roux can be used, such as cornstarch, 
but cornstarch tends to produce an overly shiny "cheap Chinese restaurant" 
effect and isn't tolerant of reheating.</p>

<p>For complete details and procedures for roasting a turkey, see our page 
<a href="turkeyroast.html"><b>Roasting a Turkey</b></a>.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="equip">Equipment</h2>

<p><img src="img/ke_oxofat1.jpg" alt="Gravy Separator" class=mrg>
You can make gravy with no equipment other than pots, pans and spoons 
you already have, but a gravy separator is a <u>huge</u> convenience. It 
is not only useful for gravy but can be used every time you make stock. 
The separator you want is the 4-cup <b>Oxo</b> (illustrated). It has its 
own strainer (though I never use that) and the rubber stopper (inserted 
before pouring stuff in) prevents fat from getting into the spout as 
happens with most separators. It's geometry is such that there's almost 
no loss of liquid. It has one glaring flaw, there isn't a brush included 
for cleaning the spout. You can buy a cheap bulb baster set to get a 
brush that works fine.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="sure">Procedure</h2>

<p>Final gravy making should begin the moment the turkey is set aside to 
rest, but you should have prepared the previous day. Gravy should be 
ready by the time you carve the turkey (25 to 40 minutes).</p>

  <b><u>Notes</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li id="01">
    <b>Giblets:</b> &nbsp; These should be in a bag 
    inside thee turkey. You may need to pour in a little warm water to 
    break them free if embeded in ice. They are supposed to be neck, 
    liver, heart and gizzard, but some packers are sloppy about exactly 
    how many of each go into the bag.</li>
  <li id="02">
    <b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Diners will expect a lot 
    more gravy than can be made with just the Giblets, even if you toss 
    in the wing tips too - so we need stock. If you don't have stock on 
    hand, toss in some chicken wings or whatever you may have to make 
    some. No vegetables, those come from the roasting pan. If nothing is 
    available, use water and three or four Chicken Bouillon Cubes.</li>

<h2><u>Day Before</u></h2> -  Make Roux and Stock
<ol>
<li><h3>Roux:</h3>  &nbsp; This will make plenty of roux to 
  guard against disasters - freeze what's left over for other thickening 
  jobs. Melt the <b>Butter</b> and bring it to frying temperature but do 
  not brown. Add <b>Flour</b> and fry slowly until flour tastes nutty and 
  cooked (but not browned). Careful with your tongue when tasting, this 
  stuff can burn.</li>
<li>Put the <b>Roux</b> in a small bowl in the freezer compartment. As 
  it freezes break it up with a spoon so you end up with a bowl of small 
  to medium frozen lumps.</li>
<li><h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; You need to end up with about 5 cups 
  of stock. This is a lot more than the Giblets alone will yield - See 
  <a href="turkeygravy.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for solutions.</li>
<li>Take the <b>Giblets</b> and <b>Neck</b> from the turkey, and the 
  <b>Wing Tips</b> (if you have elected to cut them off). Chop the neck 
  into several pieces (a sharp Chinese cleaver knife is perfect for this). 
  Cut the <b>Heart</b>, <b>Gizzard</b> and <b>Liver</b> in half. Also 
  cut up the <b>Wing Tips</b> and <b>Tail</b> if used.</li>
<li>In a large sauce pan, put one tablespoon of <b>Oil</b> and fry the 
  <b>Turkey Parts</b>, stirring until lightly browned (about 5 minutes).
  </li>
<li><u>Remove the <b>Liver</b></u>. It won't be used, so you can slice it 
  up and eat it now with a little lemon juice.</li>
<li>Add <b>Stock</b> and enough <b>Water</b> to make 7 cups. Add herbs 
  and Simmer a couple hours, skimming off any foam.</li>
<li>Strain Stock and use your gravy separator to defat it, then let stand 
  a bit and decant, leaving behind the debris that sinks to the bottom.</li>
<li>Pick any recoverable meat off the neck bones and chop it and the 
  giblets quite fine.</li>
<li>Refrigerate stock and chopped giblets (separately) until needed.</li>
</ol>
<h2><u>Turkey Day</u></h2> - Turkey is ready for the oven.
<ol>
<li>Chop <b>Vegetables</b> (see ingredient list above) and put them in 
  the roasting pan under the rack. Add about 3 cups of water to keep 
  stuff from burning until the turkey starts dripping (rather late in 
  the process) Check periodically to make sure pan hasn't become too 
  dry. Vegies should become very well browned but not burned.</li>
</ol>
<b>Turkey is Done and Resting</b>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the Roasting Pan to see if it needs more liquid to pour 
  properly. If so, add some of the stock you made yesterday to the pan. 
  Pour the liquid drippings from the roasting pan through a strainer 
  into your gravy separator. Squeeze the solids with a wooden spoon to 
  recover the liquid they retain. Return solids to the roasting pan.</li>
<li>Let the drippings settle a few minutes, then pour the liquid into 
  your prepared stock, discarding the fat.</li>
<li><b>Deglaze the pan:</b> &nbsp; Place the roasting pan over two 
  burners on the stove top. Set the burners to medium and pour in the 
  1-1/2 cups of <b>White Wine</b>. When it comes to a fast simmer, scrape 
  up the browned bits (fond) stuck to the pan. <b>Note:</b> if you've 
  roasted the turkey by <a href="turkeyroast2.html">Method #2</a> 
  (covered pan) there may be no fond to deglaze, just juice.</li>
<li>Strain the pan juices into the stock, discarding the solids.</li> 
<li>Bring to a fast simmer off to one side of the burner so any scum that 
  rises concentrates in one place and can be easily skimmed off.</li>
<li>Once skimmed, add in the <b>Giblet pieces</b> and start stirring in 
  lumps of frozen <b>Roux</b>. <u>Note</u>: you will end up with plenty 
  of roux left over so don't just dump it in. Keep stirring and adding 
  roux until the gravy has reached the thickness you desire (it should 
  coat a wooden spoon). Keep in mind that it'll thicken a bit more as 
  it cools.</li>
<li>Give it a last skimming as needed. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> 
  and <b>Pepper</b> and serve in a gravy boat.</li>
