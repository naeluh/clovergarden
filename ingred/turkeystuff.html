<span class=bg>Stuffing or Dressing? Science or Tradition?</span> Going 
the dressing route makes the whole roasting process easier and gives you 
better control of the turkey. Somehow, though, it lacks a little of the 
homey atmosphere and culinary tradition a stuffed turkey conveys. Your 
call. This is a companion page for our complete instructions for

<h2 id="gen">General Discussion</h2>

<p>Stuffing and Dressing are made from the same recipes except Dressing 
will have about 2 cups of chicken stock added. Stuffing is stuffed into 
the turkey where it is exposed to juices from the bird. Dressings are put 
in a casserole and baked, getting their juices from the added chicken 
stock.</p>

<p>Critical to producing a wonderfully moist and tender turkey with a 
crisp and tasty skin is precise control of temperature and roasting time. 
Stuffing the turkey makes this more complex and more difficult because it 
may not be up to the recommended minimum temperature (160&deg;F) by time 
the meat has reached it's recommended minimum temperature (165&deg;F - 
thickest part of thigh). With care this problem can be minimized.</p>

<p>Some chefs roast the turkey up to its final temperature, then while 
it's resting scoop the stuffing out into a casserole, add a little stock 
and bake it, first covered, then uncovered for some browning on top. This 
is also a good fall-back method if your stuffing just isn't going to be 
up to temperature. I'd leave the front cavity stuffed because it's sure 
to be up to temperature and removing it would ruin the presentation of 
the roasted bird.</p>

<p>Stuffing generally provides little flavor to the turkey because it just 
doesn't get hot enough to exude aromatic fumes, and liquids drip downward, 
so making it as dressing won't have a noticeable effect on the meat. On 
the other hand, especially if some falls out, it can definitely have an 
effect on the pan drippings, so if you're going to make gravy, and are 
going the dressing route, you might toss a handful of dressing into the 
roasting pan with the vegetables.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="equip">Equipment</h2>

<p>You'll need a copious saut&eacute; pan - 5 quarts is fine, and for dressing 
you'll need a 4 quart baking dish.</p>
<br>

<h2 id=recipe>Recipes</h2>

<p>There are thousands of stuffing recipes, but they all follow pretty 
much the same pattern:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Starch: usually bread or corn bread but sometimes rice or pasta</li>
  <li>Fat: usually provided by butter, sausage or bacon.</li>
  <li>Aromatic Vegetables: onions, celery, carrots.</li>
  <li>Sweetener: apples, raisins, chestnuts etc.</li>
  <li>Herbs & Spices</li>
  </ul>
<p>Here are a couple I've tested, but you'll find hundreds more in cookbooks 
and on the Internet.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../recipes/1jc_saussauer1.html">Sausage Sauerkraut Stuffing</a>
    - savory and aromatic, one of my favorites.</li>
  <li><a href="../recipes/1jc_sauscbread1.html">Sausage Cornbread Stuffing</a>
    - savory and aromatic, one of my favorites.</li>
  </ul>
   <p></p>

<h2 id="stuff">Stuffing Procedure</h2>

<ol>
<li>Get your stuffing all made up in accordance with your chosen recipe, 
except mixing in the bread cubes.</li>

<li>Pull your turkey out of the fridge and let it sit in the kitchen 
uncovered for about an hour to take the chill off it. This is safe because 
only the outside is likely to get above 40&deg;F and that part's going 
to go way over a safe temperature while roasting.</li>

<li>When the turkey is just about to go into the oven, and not at all 
before, bring your stuffing up to a full simmer temperature, take it off 
the heat, mix in the bread cubes and start stuffing as soon as you can 
handle it. Thick rubber gloves can help here - the ones recommended for 
lifting the turkey are fine.</li>

<li>Stuff the front first. Stretch the skin over the stuffing and pin it 
behind the neck with a bamboo skewer. The front of the turkey should now 
have a natural contour as if the turkey had just finished a good meal.
</li>

<li>Stuff the main body cavity of the turkey - not too tight since some 
stuffings expand just slightly while cooking. Some stuffing will be 
exposed between the legs, this isn't a problem, but see that it's firm 
enough so it won't all fall out when you turn the turkey breast side 
down, as you will for the first phase of roasting. See our page 
<a href="turkeyroast.html"><b>Roasting a Turkey</b></a> for complete 
procedures.</li>

<li>When the turkey has reached the target temperature of 160&deg;F, (thickest 
part of thigh), check the stuffing in the center of the main cavity and 
make sure it's at 155&deg;F (both temperatures will rise 5&deg;F while the 
turkey is resting). If it's not up there you're going to have to scoop it 
out, put it in a baking dish with a little stock, and bake it in the oven 
for 20 minutes. Leave the front stuffed as it will certainly be up to 
temperature.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h2 id="dress">Dressing Procedure</h2>

<p>Note that I recommend a hybrid system. Stuff the front cavity of the 
turkey as described above. Set up the rest as Dressing as described 
below. That stuffed into the front cavity won't be a lot, and will 
certainly achieve a safe temperature, and it makes the bird look 
better.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get your dressing all made up in accordance with your chosen recipe, 
just as for stuffing. I recommend doing this in advance, so you can 
use some of it to stuff the front cavity of the Turkey - and, because 
you'll probably have plenty of other stuff to do while the Turkey is 
roasting.</li>

<li>Butter a 4-quart baking dish to get it ready.</li>

<li>When the turkey has reached the target temperature and been brought out 
to rest, mix stock with the stuffing. The amount should be enough to get the 
bread real moist but not disintegrate it into mush, generally about 2 cups.</li>

<li>
Load the dressing into the baking dish, cover it with foil  and put it in the 
oven (you're probably putting a side dish in there at this time too).</li>

<li>Bake for about 25 minutes at 375&deg;F, (apply windage for whatever 
temperature any other side dish needs), then pull off the foil and continue 
to bake another 10 minutes or until crispy on the top.</li>
<li>Serve in a bowl or dished out into individual portions as you desire.</li>
</ol>
