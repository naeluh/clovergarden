<h1>Torchwood Family</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>The Torchwood family (<i>Burseraceae</i>) is a modest sized family 
of very resinous trees in order <i>Sapindales</i>. Many are famous for 
resins used medicinally, as incense and for various industrial purposes. 
particularly Frankincense and Myrrh. 
The photo is of a Gumbo Limbo tree (<i>Bursera simaruba</i>) native to 
the Caribbean region, including southern Florida. Its only culinary use 
is as a windbreak to protect crops from hurricanes. The fruit arils may 
be edible but are too small to harvest, except by birds. The resin is 
used as incense, glue and varnish, and is being studied as an 
anti-inflammatory medicinal.

<h2>Pili Nut</h2>
<br><img src="img/tw_pili02e.jpg" alt="Whole and Split Pili Nuts" class=mrg>
[<i>Canarium ovatum</i>]
<p>
This nut tree is native to the maritime regions of Southeast Asia, 
Papua New Guinea and Australia, but are a commercial crop mainly in the 
Philippines. Currently, the nuts are gathered in the wild, though there 
are a couple of commercial plantations started - the problem is the 
trees are very difficult to propagate reliably. A new variety, 
<i>Poamoho</i>, has been developed in Hawaii which has good production 
quality, and the seeds don't stick hard in the shells.</p>
<p>Raw, these nuts taste much like pumpkin seeds. Roasted they have a 
light nut flavor similar to Brazil nuts but are much softer. The dark 
brown seed coat is too thick to ignore and has to be removed. This is 
easily done if you split the two halves apart.</p>
<p>Pili nuts are about 8% carbohydrates, 12% protein and 70% fats and 
have significant amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and potassium.  Pili 
nut fats are about 50% monounsaturated and 35% saturated. The The main 
markets for these nuts are Hong Kong and Taiwan where they are an 
ingredient in one type of moon cake, but they are shipped all over 
Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.  The photo specimens were 
lightly roasted and were typically 1-1/2 inches long and weighed 13 
to the ounce.

<h2>Atile</h2>

[African Elemi; Atile (Nigeria); Mupafu (Africa, various spellings); 
<i>Canarium schweinfurthii</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; similar 
Buah Dabai (Malay); <i>Canarium odontophyllum</i>]
<p>
This large tree is native to tropical Africa, from Senegal to Ethiopia 
and south to Angola and Tanzania. It bears edible fruit, about 1.4 inches 
long, with a high oil content. Flavor is similar to olives. It is usually 
prepared by soaking in hot water to soften it. The fruit can be crushed 
to produce oil, often used in marinades. The hard seeds also contain 
oils and a useful oleoresin called "elemi". Oils from the seed are also 
edible and sometimes used to replace shea-butter. This fruit is usually 
harvested in the wild. Various parts of the tree are used medicinally.

<h2>Buah Dabai</h2>
<br><img src="img/tw_buah01.jpg" alt="Whole Buah Dabai Fruits" class=mrg> 
[<i>Canarium odontophyllum</i>]
<p>This fruit native to Sarawak, Malaysia, is very similar to the Atile 
(see above), and is also soaked in hot water so it will be edible. The 
green flesh under the black rind is said to taste similar to Avocado, 
and it is usually eaten with salt or soy sauce. As with the Atile and 
Pili Nut, the seed kernel is edible.

<h2>Ube</h2>

[Safou, Nsafu, African Bush Plum / Pear, Bush Butter, Butterfruit; 
Ube (Nigeria); Atanga (Gabon); <i>Dacryodes edulis</i>]
<p>
This large tree is native to tropical Africa, from Sierra Leone east to 
Uganda and south into Angola. Some are now grown in Malaysia. It bears 
edible fruit, about 1.5 inches to 4.7 inches long which can be eaten raw, 
boiled or roasted. The flesh of cooked fruit has a texture similar to 
butter. The fruit can be crushed to produce oil, and the hard seeds also 
contain oils and chemicals of industrial use, particularly Gallic Acid. 
Various parts of the tree are used medicinally. This fruit is both 
harvested wild and grown on plantations.

<h2>Chinese Black Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_chinblk01h.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Olives" class=mrg>
[Wu lan; <i>Canarium pimela</i> syn. <i>C. tramdenum</i>]
<p>
This fruit is preserved in brine and used similarly to black ripe 
<i>Oleaceae</i> olives but is not really an olive at all. It is the fruit 
of a large resinous tree, related to the frankincense tree, native to 
Southeast Asia and southern China. The flesh is relatively thin and the 
seed large and sharply pointed at both ends. Aside from the brined fruit, 
the seed kernels inside the pits of this and related species are sold as 
Canarium nut, Pili nut or Galip nut. The photo specimens were purchased 
from a large Asian market in Los Angeles, packed in brine.

<h2>Chinese White Olive</h2>
<br><img src="img/ol_chinwht01e.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut Olives" class=mrg>
[Nam liap, Samo chin, Kana (Thai); kan-lan (China); buah cana (Malay); 
<i>Canarium album</i>]
<p>
This olive shaped fruit is used similarly to <i>Oleaceae</i> olives but is 
not really an olive at all. It is the fruit of a large resinous tree, 
related to the frankincense tree, native to Southeast Asia and southern 
China. Why it is called "white" is unknown to me. The fruits are used in 
cooking both fresh, where they are somewhat resinous, and preserved by 
soaking in brine and drying. They are particularly popular in Thailand and 
Vietnam. This fruit is also used in Asian herbal medicines and cosmetics.
