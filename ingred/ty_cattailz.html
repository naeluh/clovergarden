<h1>Cattails</h1>
<br><img src="img/ty_cattail02h.jpg" alt="Cattail Plants with Flower Heads" class=mrg>
[<i>Typha latifolia</i> (Common Cattail, Broadleaf Cattail) &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; <i>Typha angustifolia</i> (Narrowleaf Cattail) &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
other species of genus <i>Typha</i> in family <i>Typhaceae</i>]
<p>
Cattails are a dominant feature of many wetland environments worldwide, 
and can be very difficult to control invasives. <i>T. latifolia</i>, 
the most widespread species, is considered a troublesome invasive in 
Hawaii and Australia. <i>T. orientalis</i> is native to all of Australia 
and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Cattail flowers are two part: a male spike at the 
top, and a sausage shaped female flowerhead below it. The female 
flowerhead matures, then bursts into many thousands of wind-born seeds. 
The two most widespread species can easily be told apart if flowering. 
<i>T. angustifolia</i> has a space between the male and female spikes, 
while <i>T. latifolia</i> has no space.

<p>All parts of cattail plants are edible during one or more stages of 
maturity.

<h2>Cattail Stems <small>&amp;</small> Leaf Bases</h2>
<br><img src="img/ty_catstm02d.jpg" alt="Pickled Cattail Stems" class=mrg>
[Bon bon (Viet); "Cossack Asparagus"]
<p>
Stems and leaf bases are edible, prepared in various ways. The Russian 
Cossacks have long eaten them raw or boiled. While called "Cossack 
Asparagus", the flavor has been reported  more like cucumber. The 
photo specimens, "Bon Bon Chua Ngot" (probably <i>T. angustifolia</i>), 
were pickled, a product of Vietnam. They were mild and lightly crunchy. 
Ingred: cattail, water, sugar, salt, vinegar, chili, preservative (E202 
(potassium sorbate)).

<h2>Cattail Rhizomes</h2>
<br>These have been eaten in Europe for at least 30,000 years. They 
are very nutritious with a protein content similar to corn or rice. 
They are often dried and ground into flour, but can be cooked similarly 
to potatoes.<p></p>

<h2>Cattail Flower Spikes</h2>
<br>Pollen from the male spikes is used as a flour enhancer and thickener, 
and in the marshes of southern Iraq in a dessert called Khirret 
(<i>T. domingensis</i>). In Chile, immature female flower spikes have 
long been battered and cooked on the stem, often called "Wild Corn Dogs"
(<i>T. angustifolia</i>). Immature female spikes have been used in many 
other ways in other cultures.<p></p>
 
<h3>Health <small>&amp;</small> Nutrition:</h3> &nbsp; Rhizomes of 
Cattail should not be eaten if they are grown in poluted water, as 
they can concentrate lead, arsenic and pesticide residus. One species, 
<i>Typha domingensis</i>, found worldwide in temperate and tropical 
climates, has been found extremely efficient (to 98%) at removing 
disease causing enterobacteria (from animal intestines) from 
agricultural water.
