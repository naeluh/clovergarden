[Or&eacute;gano Cimmaron, Scented Lippia, Scented Matgrass; 
<i>Lippia graveolens</i> (Verbina family)]
<p>
   This shrub, native to the US Southwest, through Mexico and as far 
   south as Nicaragua, is an important culinary herb in the cuisines 
   of Mexico and Central America. It is also used in the US Southwest, 
   but is still a bit difficult to find here in Los Angeles.</p>
   <p>Some related herbs, particularly <i>Lippia alba</i> (White Lippia) 
   and <i>Lippia palmeri</i> are similarly used.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; While possibly more available in Arizona or 
New Mexico, this herb is very difficult to find in Los Angeles, and 
probably impossible in most regions. It is, however, fairly available 
on-line, but shop for a good price.  Always buy in leaf form and grind 
it yourself, as it is much more durable than pre-ground.

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; In a sealed container with as little air 
space as practical, kept in a cool place and away from direct sunlight, 
this herb should last at least a year, in leaf form. Half that or less 
if powdered.<p></p>

<h3>Substitute:</h3> &nbsp; To me, the Mexican oregano tastes more minty 
than Mediterranean oregano, so perhaps just a touch of dried mint leaf 
with the oregano leaf.<p></p>
