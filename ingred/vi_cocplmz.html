  [Paradise Plum, Icaco; Gbafilo (Nigeria (seeds)); 
  <i>Chrysobalanus icaco</i>]
</p><p>
   Native to the tropical Americas and Caribbean, including southern 
   Florida and the Bahamas, and also tropical Africa, this large shrub 
   can grow over 20 feet tall. Fruit of the coastal variety can be as 
   large as 2 inches diameter, and is usually light yellow with a pink 
   blush, but it can also be dark purple. Fruit of the inland variety 
   is usually 1 inch diameter and dark purple.</p>
   <p>The fruit is eaten raw and made into preserves. The seed kernels 
   are also eaten, either raw or roasted. Dried seed kernels are ground 
   for use in Nigerian Pepper Soup. Opinions on the raw fruit vary 
   from sweet-sour and cottony to soft and sweet. The seed kernels are 
   about 21% oil, which can be pressed and used in place of almond oil, 
   or to make soap and the like. The photo was take in southern Florida.

<p>The photo to the left is of Coco Plum seeds, called Gbafilo in 
Nigeria. One is broken open to show the seed kernel, the part used in 
Nigerian Pepper Soup and other soups. These seeds were 1.37 inches long 
by 1.04 inches diameter (3.5 x 2.6 cm) weighing 0.26 ounces (7.3 gms). 
I found the flavor rather bitter and astringent, but slightly aromatic.
</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; The photo specimens were purchased on-line for 
2018 US $1.40 each plus shipping.</p>


<p><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; This seed is shelled and the kernel ground for 
inclusion in Nigerian Pepper Soups. </p>
