This tree, growing to 130 feet, is native to West Africa from Senegal to 
northern Angola, and southwest through the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. It is a very economically important tree, bearing small, edible, 
mango-like green fruits, particularly valued for the seeds they 
contain. The fruit pulp is made into jams, jellies and drinks, 
sometimes wine.</p>
<p>The single seed is broken open to release the edible endosperm. 
this may be eaten raw or roasted, but is commonly ground for use as 
a flavoring and thickener for soups and stews. The seeds can also be 
pressed for an oil that is solid at room temperature. This oil can be 
used for cooking or made into soaps or cosmetics.</p>

<p><b>Buying:</b> &nbsp; I have purchased the seed kernels on-line from 
JEB Foods for 2018 US $15.47 for 8 ounces, including shipping.</p>

<p><b>Health &amp; Nutrition:</b> &nbsp; The seeds of this plant are 
high in oil (67%) and have significant protein 8.5%.</p> 
<p>In the West, this tree is now very much in vogue for reported weight 
loss benefits from seed extract. This use has not been confirmed by 
clinical trials, but a meta analysis found it may have "some potential 
benefit for weight loss". Side effects are headache, flatulence, and 
difficulty sleeping.
