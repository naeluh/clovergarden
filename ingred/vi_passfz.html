<h1>Passion Fruit</h1>

[Maracuj&aacute; (Portuguese); Maracuy&aacute;, Parcha (Spanish); 
Grenadille, Fruit de la Passion (French); Liliko'i (Hawaiian); 
Mburukuja (Guarani); Markisa (Indonesia); Saowarot (Thai); Chanh Day 
(Viet); Granadilla <i>purple</i>, Guavadilla <i>yellow</i> (South 
Africa); Chinola (Dominican Republic); <i>Passiflora edulis</i> and 
others of Family <i>Passifloraceae</i>]
<p>
These perennial vines are native to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and 
northern Argentina. They are now grown in tropical and subtropical 
regions worldwide, including California and Florida. The fruits are 
eaten fresh in some regions, but their main uses are for juice, used 
in many beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike) and in desserts. 
There are two varieties, the normal purple, and the much larger 
(up to grapefruit size) yellow var <i>flavicarpa</i> which is not as 
popular due to often being more acidic and less aromatic. The yellow is 
sometimes used as vigorous rootstock with the purple grafted on.</p>
<p>The name "Passion Flower" comes from the practice of Catholic 
missionaries using  the characteristics of the flower to enumerate 
features of the Passion (crucifixion) of the Christ to natives they 
were trying to convert.

<h2>Purple Passion Fruit</h2>
<br><img src="img/vi_passion04g.jpg" alt="Purple Passion Fruit, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
<i>Passiflora edulis</i>]
<p>
Varieties characteristic of inland regions produce dark purple fruit 
about about 1 inch diameter, while varieties grown in coastal regions 
may be considerably larger. The photo specimens, grown in USA, were up 
to 3 inches long, 2-3/8 inches diameter, and 2.5 ounces. Yield was 60% 
with seeds - sorry, I ate the seeds along with the pulp so I can't give 
you a yield for just the pulp. The shell and enclosed pith are not 
particularly edible, but the pulp was attractively sweet-tart, aromatic 
and flavorful, a bit more tart than tamarind. At the going price, I'd 
recommend just cutting them in half and eating the pulp with a spoon, 
rather than diluting it in some recipe.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimens were purchased from a 
multi-ethnic market in Los Angeles (La Crescenta) for 2016 US $1.99 
per each (about $14.15 per pound).  They are also available at a lower 
price in some Asian markets, frozen from Vietnam. The frozen taste 
about the same.

<h2>Yellow / Goldern Passion Fruit</h2>
<br><img src="img/vi_passify02g.jpg" alt="Yellow Passion Fruit, whole &amp; cut" class=mrg>
[<i>Passiflora edulis</i> var <i>flavicarpa</i>]
<p>
Yellow Passion Fruits are larger than the purple, and are generally 
more tart, but degree of tartness varies with cultivar and soil.
The photo specimens were up to 2.7 inches diameter and 4.0 ounces, 
but some yellow cultivars can top 4 inches diameter. Yield was 
55% with seeds - sorry, I ate the seeds along with the pulp so I can't 
give you a yield for just the pulp. The shell was not edible. The 
enclosed soft pith was edible, but had almost no flavor. The pulp was 
attractively sweet-tart, with an amazingly aromatic flavor. At the 
going price, I'd recommend just cutting them in half and eating the 
pulp with a spoon, rather than diluting it in some recipe. The 
flavor should be appreciated.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimens were purchased from a 
large market in Los Angeles (Burbank) specializing in Mexican and 
Central and South American foods. They were sold as "Maracuya", at 
2018 US $8.99 per pound - growing region not determined.

<h2>Water Lemon</h2>

[Jamaican honeysuckle, Golden bellapple; Pomme liane (Martinique &nbsp; 
Guadeloupe); Orange lilikoi (Hawaii); <i>Passiflora laurifolia</i>]
<p>
Water Lemon vines are native to the American Tropics but have spread 
to other tropical regions. They are considered invasives wherever they 
grow, but are restricted in range because they can not tolerate any 
frost. They are otherwise very tolerant, but grows best in slightly humid 
environments and like year-round ground moisture. Ripe fruits may be 
orange or green with longitudinal darker green stripes. They are up to 
2 inches diameter and 3 inches long. The fruit pulp is flavorful and 
aromatic, but lacks the tartness of other edible Passion Fruit species.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fruit is not much cultivated, but is found 
in markets in the regions where it can be found wild. It probably can 
be found in southern Florida.

<h2>Badea</h2>

Giant Tumbo <i>Passiflora quadrangularis</i>]
<p>
Badea vines are native to the American Tropics, and are cultivated in 
the Caribbean region and South America.They require a warm moist 
climate and can be damaged if temperatures fall below 50&deg;F/10&deg;C. 
Ripe fruits are green, and up to nearly 12 inches long. The fruit pulp 
is flavorful, aromatic, and lightly tart. Unlike other Passion Fruits, 
the thick pericarp surrounding the seed mass is also eaten, and immature 
fruits are cooked as vegetables. Leaves and roots have medicinal uses, 
but roots are toxic so caution is advised.

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; This fruit is cultivated and harvested wild 
in it's growing region, but requires humidity and a minimum temperature 
of 59&deg;F/15&deg;C to fruit, so it is rarely found outside its 
native region.

<h2>Chulupa</h2>

[Sweet Calabash, Conch Apple, Wild Purple Passionfruit, Sweet Cup; 
<i>Passiflora maliformis</i>]
<p>
This tropical vine is native to the Caribbean, Central America and 
northern South America, and is cultivated in the Caribbean region. 
Fruits may be green, yellow or purple when ripe, and up to 1-3/4 inches 
diamter. The rind is much harder than with other Passion Fruits, but the 
pulp, light gray in color, is flavorful, aromatic, and lightly tart. It 
is used for beverages or eaten raw. This plant grows in warm, wet tropics 
and needs 61&deg;F/16&deg;C when flowering.
