<h1>Violets - Order Malpighiales</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<b><i>Malpighiales</i></b> is a huge order, containing some 
16,000 species, almost 8% of all flowering plants, but for 
edibles, it isn't that big, and it's a bit odd. The family <i>Viola</i> includes the 
Violets and Pansies, familiar house and garden flowering plants. Except 
for this photo of Early Dog-Violet (<i>Viola reichenbachiana</i>) we 
don't discuss <i>Viola</i> here, because there's nothing to eat.

<h2>Spurge Family</h2>
<br><a href="sr_spurge.html">
<img src="img/sr_poinset01h.jpg" alt="Red and White Poinsettia Flowers" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Euphorbiaceae</i>]
<p>
The Euphorbia are a truly vast family with over 8,000 species, almost 
all of which are slightly to extremely toxic, or at least allergenic, 
yet the family includes one very important edible plant (edible so long 
as you eat only the right parts) and some others with significant 
culinary and industrial uses. Many have significant medicinal 
value. The

<h2>Mangosteen Family</h2>
<br><a href="cl_mangost.html">
<img src="img/cl_mangos04k.jpg" alt="Whole &amp; Cut Mangosteen Fruit" class=mrg></a>
[<i>Clusiaceae</i>]
<p><i>Clusiaceae</i> is a modest size family of 14 genera containing about 
595 species, a fair number of which bear edible fruit. Because the 
mangosteen fruit is exotic, expensive and loaded with antioxidants, it 
is being heavily promoted by the "health food" industry as a 
"miracle fruit". When that wears out, there's other members of the family 
to take its place.

<h2>Flax / Flaxseed</h2>
<br><a href="vi_flaxz.html">
<img src="img/vi_flax01h.jpg" alt="Flax Seeds" class=mrg></a>
[Family <i>Linaceae</i>; <i>Linum usitatissimum</i>]
<p>
Common flax is native from the eastern Mediterranean on east to India, and 
has been planted in many other regions of Europe, North America, and Africa. 
It is well known as the source of fiber for making linen cloth, but also has 
a varity of food uses.</p>
<p>Flax seeds are about 1/4 inch long, hard and shiny. They are pressed for  
linseed oil, which has been much used in oil based paints, varnish and 
in the manufacture of linoleum. Edible oil is called Flaxseed Oil and has 
some health benefits, but is quite perishable. Whole Flaxseed has more 
health benefits if freshly ground, but is also perishable in that 
form, so care is needed.

<i>Irvingia gabonensis</i>]
<p>
This tree, growing to 130 feet, is native to West Africa from Senegal to 
northern Angola, and southwest through the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. It is a very economically important tree, bearing small, edible, 
mango-like green fruits, particularly valued for the seeds they 
contain. In the West, this tree is now very much in vogue for reputed 
weight loss from seed extract.

Mangrove; <i>B. sexangula</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>B. cylindrica</i> 
&amp; others]
<p>
All members of this of this genus inhabit mangrove swamps, generally on 
the sea side of the swamp. The photo is of a <i>B. gymorrhiza</i> plant 
with fruit pods developing right out of the center of flowers. The fruit 
pods can be up to 4-3/4 inches long, and contain embryos rather than 
seeds. Ripe pods drip into the mud and the embrios quickly develop 
roots.</p> 
<p><i>B. gymorrhiza</i> is native to southeast Africa and the Maldive 
islands southwest of India. In the Maldives, developing fruit pods are 
peeled, then boiled in water as a vegetable, changing the water at least 
four times. <i>B. cylindrica</i> is native from the Maldives through 
India and Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea and Queensland Australia. 
In Thailand the root tips are much liked, the bark is used as a spice, 
and leaf shoots are cooked as a vegetable. In the Maldives, developing 
fruit pods are used the same as those of <i>B. gymorrhiza</i>, which is 
preferred. <i>B. sexangula</i> is native to Southeast Asia, Australia 
and New Caledonia. Developing fruit pods are soaked, then cooked as a 
vegetable.

<h2>Indian Gooseberry Family</h2>
<br> [<i>Phyllanthaceae</i>] &nbsp; This is a sizeable family of at least 
54 genera. Many species within are well known trees and shrubs with very 
wide distribution.

   <br><img src="img/sr_stargoose06h.jpg" alt="Pickled Star Gooseberries" class=mrg>
   [Otaheite gooseberry, Tahitian / Malay / West India gooseberry, 
   Grosella (Puerto Rico), <i>Phyllanthus acidus</i>]
   <p>
   This tree-like shrub, thought native to Madagascar, was formerly 
   listed as a Spurge (family Euphorbiaceae). It is completely unrelated 
   to actual gooseberries which are in a totally different order, 
   <i>Saxifragales</i>.</p>
   <p>This berry is now grown mainly in Southeast Asia, and judging from 
   the number of brands of pickled ones available in my local Asian 
   markets it is quite popular there. Some are grown in Hawaii for local 
   consumption. Since introduction to Jamaica, it has managed to spread 
   through the Caribbean and to Central and South America. The photo 
   shows pickled ones up to 7/8 inch diameter, 5/8 inch high and weighing 
   8 to the ounce. They are crisp, quite tart but tempered with sugar, 
   and have a single stone (shown to left in photo). They are also cooked 
   with sugar until they turn red and are used to make jelly, or can be 
   crushed for juice used to make beverages.

   <i>Antidesma platyphyllum</i> &amp; many others]
   <p>
   This genus of about 100 species is endemic to Southeast Asia, 
   Queensland Australia, southern China and as far east as Hawaii, with 
   at least one species in Nigeria (probably introduced through trade 
   with South / Southeast Asia). They range from short shrubs to trees 
   nearly 100 feet high. The fruits, about 0.4 inch diameter, are edible 
   but a little hard to harvest because bunches don't ripen evenly. They 
   are sour and astringent when white, sour when red, and sweet-tart when 
   fully ripened to black.

   <p>
   This substantial tree (to 75 feet) is native to South and Southeast 
   Asia and to Australia and Polynesia as well as Taiwan and the 
   southern half of China. An attractive shade tree, it has become 
   invasive in southern Florida, Southern California, and Caribbean 
   Islands. Female trees bear clusters of berries about .35 inch (9 mm) 
   diameter which can be brown, reddish or blue-black when ripe.</p>
  
   <p>The fruit is fermented into wine. The seeds are edible and contain 
   about 40% oil, but that oil is used mainly as a lubricant rather 
   than in cooking. Young leaves are eaten in Laos, dipped in 
   chili sauce, or cooked as a vegetable or used in salads. Roots and 
   bark are used medicinally.

   <i>Emblica officinalis</i>]
   <p>
   Native to tropical South and Southeast Asia, this medium size tree 
   (up to 59 feet) bears greenish yellow spherical fruit, between 1 and 2 
   inches diameter with a single small stone in the center. The fruit is 
   firm, sour, somewhat bitter, astringent and fibrous, and very high 
   in vitamin C. It is not available fresh in Southern California, but 
   Indian markets here have it as dried pieces and dried powder, under 
   the name Amla.</p>
   <p>To eat this fruit fresh, it is steeped in salt water and turmeric 
   or chili, but it is more commonly salt pickled with oil and spices, 
   particularly in southern India where the preserves are popular with 
   dal. In northern India the fruits are given a very long soak in sugar 
   syrup, then incorporated into deserts. The fruit, fresh or dried, is 
   used as a souring agent, sometimes as a substitute for Tamarind. 
   In Indian recipes it is also a common standard descripter for the 
   size of a lump of Tamarind pulp. Various parts of this tree are 
   also of significant medicinal value, with research ongoing.

   These mid-size trees (40 feet or so) are native from India through 
   Malaysia. They bear fruit on long strings that sprout directly from 
   the tree trunks and branches. Fruit can range from 3/4 inch to 2 
   inches diameter and is usually orange when ripe, but Burmese Grape 
   fruit    may be yellow through bright red to purple and between 1 
   and 1.4 inches diameter.</p>
   <p>The taste of these fruits is sweet and 
   tangy, with Tampol being similar to tangerines in flavor. Rambai is 
   cultivated for fruit in Thailand and Malaysia. The fruits are fairly 
   perishable and are often salt pickled for storage. They are also 
   fermented into wine or made into jams. Bark, roots and 
   wood are used medicinally.

These perennial vines are native to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and 
northern Argentina. They are now grown in tropical and subtropical 
regions worldwide, including California and Florida.The fruits are eaten 
fresh in some regions, but its main uses are for juice, used in many 
beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike) and in deserts. There are 
two varieties, the normal purple, and the much larger (up to grapefruit 
size) yellow var <i>flavicarpa</i> which is not as popular due to often 
being more acidic and less aromatic. The yellow is sometimes used as 
vigorous rootstock with the purple grafted on. Other <i>Passiflora</i> 
species are less widely known.

   <p>
   This small tree (to 30 feet high) is native to west central Brazil, 
   where the fruit it bears is quite popular. The fruit are round to 
   oval and about 3 inches diameter, turning bright orange when ripe. 
   They contain 1 to 4 segments in which the same number of seeds are 
   surrounded by an edible pulp. The pulp has a strong taste and aroma 
   described as sweet, fruity and cheesy. It is both eaten raw and 
   cooked as an ingredient in recipes, particularly with rice and 
   chicken. It is also used as an ingredient in beverages.</p>
   <p>The seeds have a lot of prickly spines, which can be scraped off 
   after drying for a few days. The nuts are cracked open and the 
   kernels are roasted with salt and eaten as a snack. Unfortunately 
   this tree is now under pressure due to land clearing for logging, 
   and the planting of eucalyptus, so it is becoming scarce.

   [Genus <i>Salix</i>]
   <p>
   This is a large genus of between 350 and 400 known species - but, 
   sorry, there's nothing at all to eat here. The only culinary 
   application for willows has been for weaving baskets to carry food 
   in. They are, however, noted medicinals, some species containing 
   significant amounts of salicin, source material for the salicylic 
   acid in aspirin.  Back in the days of my childhood we made whistles 
   from willow branches. The bark could be pushed off, the wood carved 
   as needed and the bark pushed back into place.

   This large tree (to 50 feet), often planted as a decorative, is native 
   to East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Female trees 
   are heavy producer of long panicles of edible red fruit between 0.2 and 
   0.4 inch diameter.  The fruit is a bit seedy, but edible either raw or 
   cooked. Both male and female trees must be together to produce 
   significant amounts of fruit. This fast growing tree is listed by 
   <a href="http://www.pfaf.org/user/default.aspx">Plants for a 
   Future</a>.

[Keluak, Keluwak (Indonesia); Kepayang (Malay); <i>Pangium edule</i> of 
family <i>Achariaceae</i>]
<p>
This large tree (to 80 feet high), native to Indonesia, Papua New 
Guinae and Malaysia, bears large round fruit up to 10 inches diameter, 
sometimes called "football fruit". The fruit contains soft yellow pulp 
that is highly aromatic and highly toxic (cyanide), in which are 
embedded seeds about 3/4 inch long, which are also highly toxic.</p>
<p>Fruit are gathered in the wild. The seeds are boiled, then buried 
in ashes, banana leaves and soil for about 40 days to ferment and turn 
black. They are then washed and ground into a black paste called rawon, 
an essential ingredient for a number of popular Indonesian recipes. 
The paste may be dried and ground to powder for longer storage.
