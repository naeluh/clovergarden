<p>
Viri come in many shapes, but are of very similar structure to the 
HIV virus illustrated. All have a form of the Docking Glycoprotein with 
which to penetrate Eukaryote, Archaea and Bacteria cells, as they cannot 
reproduce except by using facilities within those cells. Because they 
cannot reproduce by themselves, they are called "organisms on the edge 
of life" rather than life forms. To reproduce, they subvert the DNA of 
a penetrated cell to use its Ribosomes to generate copies of themselves.
