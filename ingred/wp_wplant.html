<h1>Alismatid Monocots</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
These two Orders, (<a href="wp_wplant.html#alis"><b><i>Alismatales</i></b></a> and 
<a href="wp_wplant.html#acora"><b><i>Acorales</i></b></a>) are considered the 
"Basal Monocots", having branched off the evolutionary path earlier than 
the more modern monocots. They still display some features of plants 
along the path leading to the Eudicots, from which the monocots branched 
off. It is thought the whole <a href="lily.html">Monocot Clade</a> is 
descended from aquatic plants due to a range of unique characteristics.

<h2 class=lrg id=alis>Order Alismatales - Water Plantains</h2>

<p><i>Alismatales</i> consisted of a number of obscure aquatic and 
marine plants of minor culinary interest - until APG II found a 
large and important family of swamp plants, the Arums, belonged to this 
order.

<h2>Arums</h2>
<br><a href="am_arum.html">
<img src="img/am_taro25h.jpg" alt="Growing Arum Plants" class=mrg></a>
[family <i>Araceae</i>]
<p>
This family of plants is of critical importance as food crops in tropical 
regions, growing well where other starchy food crops cannot thrive. 
Leaves of some are also cooked and eaten. Interestingly the Arums produce 
both the largest and the smallest flowers known in nature. One tiny free 
floating aquatic variety, long known for cleaning up fish ponds, is now 
being developed as a nutritious ingredient for food processing. Due to 
their importance as both decoratives and food plants, the 
<a href="am_arum.html"><b>Arum Family</b></a> has its own page.

&nbsp; | &nbsp; Duck Potato, Indian Potato, Broadleaf Arrowhead, Wapato: 
<i>Sagittaria latifolia</i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>Sagittaria trifolia</i>'  
all of family <i>Alismataceae</i>]
<p>
<i>S. sagittifolia</i> is native through most of Europe and Asia, 
from Siberia to Turkey and on to Australia. The foliage of this plant 
is shown in the photo at the top of this page. The tubers are seasonably 
available in Asian markets here in Los Angeles. They can be eaten raw or 
cooked, including fried as chips. They are bland and starchy, much like 
potato, but when cooked are somewhat crunchier. The photo specimens were 
2-1/4 inches diameter and weighed 3 ounces each. They do not keep well 
even refrigerated, so should be cooked within a few days of purchase. 
Boiled tubers figure prominently in both Chinese and Japanese New Years 
celebrations.</p>
<p><i>S. latifolia</i>, native to the Americas, is not sold commercially. 
It was at one time eaten by the North American Indians but today is eaten 
mainly by beavers, porcupines and muskrats.  It is native from southern 
Canada all the way down to northern South America, but has become 
naturalized in much of Europe.<p>
<p><i>S. trifolia</i>, native from Ukraine to Southeast Asia, including 
the Philippines, is cultivated in parts of Asia for its nutritious 
tubers.	 Species not listed here may also be eaten in the regions where 
they grow.

[Waterblommetjie (South Africa), Water Hawthorn, Vleikos: 
<i>Aponogeton distachyos</i>; of family <i>Aponogetonaceae</i>] 
<p>
This pond plant, native to South Africa, is now cultivated there 
and in some other suitable regions. In South Africa, its flower buds have 
been valued as a flavoring since arrival of the first Dutch settlers. 
It is most used in a mutton stew called Waterblommetjie Bredie. This 
plant grows from a tuberous rhizome which goes dormant when the ponds 
(Vleis) dry up, and sprout new foliage when the rains return. Outside 
South Africa it is often used for pond landscaping, from which it has 
escaped and reportedly become naturalized in parts of southwestern 
California.

Family <i>Limnocharis</i>] 
<p>
Native to the tropical Americas, including the Caribbean, this plant has 
become naturalized in wet environments through South and Southeast Asia, 
including southern China. Despite it's America origin, the leaves and 
stems are widely eaten in Asia in soups, curries, salads and stir fries.
In Isan (eastern Thailand) it is often eaten raw with sour chili sauce.
In some regions it is considered food for the poor due to its modest 
flavor.

<h2 class=lrg id="acora">Order Acorales</h2>

<p>This order, consisting of a single family, containing a single genus, 
with only two species, is the oldest surviving monocot order.</p>


<table>
<tr><td class=ind></td><td>


<h2>Sweet Flag</h2>
<br><img src="img/am_sflag01k.jpg" alt="Flowering Plant" class=mrg>
[<i>Acorus calamus</i> (Eurasian species) &nbsp; <i>Acorus calamus</i> 
var <i>americanus</i> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <i>Acorus gramineus</i> (Asian); 
of Family <i>Acoraceae</i>]
<p>
Once placed among the Arums, APG II has placed Acorus not only in its own 
family, but in a separate order, as the last known representative of the 
oldest line of monocots. As a sister group to all other monocots, it may 
be a precursor to the Arums,  or even to all the Alismatales. Not all 
botanists accept this placement. Fossils have been found from the Eocene, 
about 50 million years ago.</p>
<p>The grass-like leaves of this bog plant are common in the northeast 
U.S. and Asia. The rhizomes (underground stems) were eaten by Native 
Americans in times past but it is no longer a significant food plant. 
European settlers planted the Eurasian variety, although the American 
variety (identical to a Siberian variety) was already common in North 
America.</p>
<p>Sweet Flag was long used as a food flavoring and in perfumes, but the 
FDA banned all varieties from food in 1968 when one variety in India was 
found to contain a carcinogen, even though the varieties found here don't 
contain that substance. In areas where Sweet Flag grows, leaves are 
sometimes placed in jars of sugar as a flavoring substitute for vanilla 
bean. Leaves are used for their fragrance and to repel weevils from stored 
grains. The root is used medicinally.
