[Nagaimo, Yamaimo (Japan); Glutinous Yam, Cinnamon vine, Japanese 
Mountain Yam, Chinese Yam; Ma (Korea); Shan yao, Huai shan, 
Huai shan yao (China); Cu mai, Khoai mai (Viet); 
<i>Dioscorea polystachya</i>]

   Native to Southern China this yam has been cultivated in Japan from very 
   early times. Known in the U.S. mainly as an invasive weed, this vine with 
   arrowhead shaped leaves grows large tubers below ground and small tubers 
   above ground. It spreads mainly by dropping these small "air potatoes" 
   and rarely flowers.</p>
   <p>Nagaimo is roughly cylindrical and may be two or three feet 
   long, but the photo specimen was 24 inches long, 2-7/8 inches diameter and 
   weighed 3-1/4 pounds. The skin is tan and the flesh is white and, unlike 
   other yams, sticky and more than a bit slimy.  The two Japanese names, 
   nagaimo and yamaimo (shorter, thicker), are applied depending on the 
   root shape.</p>

<h3>Uses:</h3> &nbsp; In China this yam is widely used in herbal 
medicine, but in Japan it is more used for food. While most yams require 
at least cooking to detoxify them, this yam is eaten raw and shredded 
after being soaked whole in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize 
oxalic acid in the skin. It is also used to make yamaimo soba noodles. 
Tororo, sometimes served over sushi or with rice, is grated yam mixed 
with dashi, shoyu and mirin. Some say this yam is an "acquired taste" 
outside of Japan, but considering the quantities sold in Southern 
California's Chinese and Southeast Asian markets, that taste seems to 
have been rather widely acquired<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These are found in markets serving East Asian 
and Southeast Asian communities. Most often they are cut into segments and 
packaged on foam trays covered with clear shrink wrap, but some markets 
have them loose, full length or cut. They should be a very light tan, a 
reddish color indicates they have been on the shelf too long.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; For a yam, nagaimo is rather perishable. It 
needs to be kept dry, cool and in the dark. For shipping, whole nagaimo 
is often packed in sawdust but you can wrap it in newspaper and keep it 
in the refrigerator or another cool place for about 2 weeks. Cut, it 
should be kept refrigerated and used in less than a week. Raw grated 
nagaimo can be kept frozen in a form that allows it to be broken or 
cut off as needed.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> For most traditional Japanese recipes nagaimo is 
shredded or grated and used raw or lightly cooked. I find the fine 
shredding side of my grater does a good job. You end up with a gooey 
mush that's slimier than snail snot, but do not be discouraged - it 
cooks quite well by various methods, and the result is not slimy.
<p></p>

<h3>Medicinal Uses:</h3> &nbsp; This yam has long been important in 
Chinese herbal medicine and also in Japan. It is used for a variety of 
digestive and respiratory problems, diabetes, lowering blood pressure and 
cholesterol, and male sexual disfunction.<p></p>

<p>It has been reported that in Japan, during the Edo period, slippery 
grated nagaimo was used in the men's baths for purposes beyond the 
scope of this page. For this reason it was considered improper for 
women to eat it.</p>
