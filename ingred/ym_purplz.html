<p>
Native to Southeast Asia, there are many cultivars of this yam, 
varying from deep purple to white. Intensely purple varieties are 
very popular through South and Southeast Asia, particularly the 
Philippines, while most grown in Africa are white. These are the most 
common yam in Africa, but are little available in North American markets, 
even in Los Angeles with our large Philippine population. They are listed 
as noxious weeds in a few southeastern states, particularly Florida. The 
purple color comes from anthocyanin flavonoids, which have antioxidant 
properties, but how well these survive digestion is debatable.

<p>These plants also produce tiny "air potatoes" at the bases of their 
leaves. If these fall to the ground they will start new plants. these 
potatoes are not considered as good as the mature root tubers, but 
are convenient to gather and used where these plants grow in profusion.

<h2>Water Yam</h2>

<p>In West Africa, particularly Nigeria, white varieties (Water Yam) 
are used rather than purple. These are not easy to find in North America, 
but are quite popular in West Africa. They are sweeter and much more 
mucilaginous than the White Yam, so their usage is somewhat different.

<p>The Japanese <a href="ym_nagaimoz.html"><b>Nagaimo Yam</b></a> is 
also mucilaginous, but I don't know if it would be a suitable substitute 
because I haven't acquired a Water Yam yet to compare it to. The 
Nagaimo is easily available in Asian markets here in Los Angeles.

<h2>Purple Yam</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Uses:</h3> &nbsp; Because it is quite sweet, the Purple Yam is often 
used in making confections and desserts, particularly in the Philippines 
and India. The color also works well for these applications. In the 
Philippines it is often grated, mixed with coconut milk and cooked 
down into a bright blue jelly. In Gujarati, India it is used in mixed 
vegetable dishes, and in Vietnam it is used in a popular soup.<p></p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; Purple Yams can now be had from a few on-line 
sources. &nbsp; <b><u>Caution</u>:</b> Philippine markets and some other 
Asian markets have bins of "Purple Yams" with light beige skins. They are 
<a href="mg_okinaz.html"><b>Okanawan Sweet Potatoes</b></a>, not yams 
at all. They are purple inside, but not nearly as intensively as the real 
Purple Yam, and they are not as sweet. Some Philippine markets have 
real Purple Yam chunks in the frozen food cases.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These will store in a cool dark place similarly 
to potatoes, for a month or more.<p></p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Cooked, its purple color darkens to deep 
violet.

<h2>Purple Yam Flour</h2>
<br><img src="img/ym_powd02e.jpg" alt="Purple Yam Powder" class=mrg>

<p>This flour is used in the Philippines as a coloring to produce purple 
Lumpia wrappers, purple ice cream, purple puddings, etc. It is available 
from Philippine markets here in Los Angeles, but at a high price. The 
photo specimen (1/4 teaspoon) came from a 4.05 ounce packet purchased 
for 2019 US $4.99. Ingred: dried purple yam. The store had another brand 
at a little lower price, but it was a much lighter color.
