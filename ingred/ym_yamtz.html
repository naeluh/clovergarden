<h1>Yam, White / Yellow</h1>
<br><img src="img/ym_name02g.jpg" alt="Whole and Cut White Yams" class=mrg>
[Boniato (Spanish), Nyami (Africa); &Ntilde;ame (Panama); 
     <i>D. rotundata</i>, <i>D. cayenensis</i>]
<p>
   True Yams are grown in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Latin 
   America, but are only beginning to take root in North America. Unlike 
   sweet potatoes they have a rough scaly skin, and can grow to as much 
   as 150 pounds, though they are generally marketed at only a few 
   pounds. Both White and Yellow varieties are native to Africa, but 
   now grown in the Tropics worldwide. One variety, Kokoro, is used 
   to make Yam Chips and for drying.</p>

<p>True Yams are not interchangeable with North American "Yams", which 
are orange Sweet Potatoes (and now other colors as well). Flavor, 
texture and cooking properties are all different. Orange Sweet Potatoes 
are far too sweet to use in recipes for real Yams.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; These Yams can be found in markets serving an 
African, South or Southeast Asian, Caribbean or Latin American 
community. White varieties are quite available in North America, but 
I haven't seen the Yellow variety here in Southern California.<p></p>

<h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; These will store in a cool dark place similarly 
to potatoes, for a month or more.<p></p>
