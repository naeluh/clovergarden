<h1>Zygophyllales - Order</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
The order <i>Zygophyllales</i> (Caltrops, Creosote Bushes) stands within 
the huge, economically and nutritionally important, clade <i>Rosids</i>, 
but itself contains only two families, and only a few species significant 
for food.

   <br><img src="img/zy_balaegyp02h.jpg" alt="Ripe Fruit and Sticks" class=mrg>
   [Soap Berry Tree, Thron Tree, Egyptian myrobalan, Egyptian balsam, 
   Zachum oil tree; Lalob, Hidjihi, Inteishit, Heglig, Hijlij (Arabic); 
   Aduwa, Mchunju. Bedena (Africa); <i>Balanites aegyptiaca</i>]   
   <p>
   This shrub or small tree (to 33 feet) is common in Egypt, and all 
   across Africa in the Sahel-Savannah band south of the Sahara. It is 
   also found on the Arabian Peninsula. Though called "desert date" 
   it is not at all related to the date palm. It is known to have been 
   cultivated in Egypt for more than 4000 years. The fruit, about 1 inch 
   long, is somewhat bitter, but is appreciated in dry periods when other 
   food plants are not bearing much fruit.</p>
   <p> Leaves and shoots are eaten raw or cooked during famine times, and 
   the flowers are also eaten. The oily seeds are shelled and boiled to 
   make them less bitter. They are also ground, then boiled in lots of 
   water, and the oil is skimmed from the top to use as cooking oil. 
   The fruit is also fermented to produce an alcoholic beverage. Various 
   parts of the tree are used for medicinal purposes, and processed into 
   soap.</p>
   <p>There are a few other <i>Balanites</i> species that are used 
   similarly, but on a much lesser scale. Their fruit varies from sweet 
   to mildly toxic, and their seeds are moderately toxic, but the oil 
   from the seeds is not toxic.

   <h2 id="punct">Puncture Weed</h2>
   <br><img src="img/zy_punctw01h.jpg" alt="Blooming Puncture Weed" class=mrg>
   [Puncture-vine, goat's-head, bindii, small caltrops, devil's-thorn, 
   devil's-weed, Tackweed. <i>Tribulus terrestris</i> of subfamily 
   <i>Tribuloideae</i>]   
   <p>
   I remember when, 65 years ago, this noxious stuff sprawled all over 
   sidewalks in Burbank, California, puncturing bicycle tires and 
   painfully stabbing feet, even through thin soled shoes. It seems to 
   have been largely eradicated, I haven't seen any for many years, but 
   there's probably still some around. This troublesome weed is native to 
   the Mediterranean region, but has been naturalized to all the warmer 
   regions of the world, all the way up into Canada, and as far south as 
   Australia.</p>
   <p>In East Asia, the leaves and tender shoots are eaten, and the stems 
   have been used to adulterate diluted Buttermilk, making it look like 
   undiluted. Among body builders, an extract is used that is supposed 
   to increase testosterone, but controlled studies have failed to show 
   this, and it has not been proven safe.

<h2 class=lrg><i>Krameriaceae</i> - Family</h2>
<p></p>

   <p>Native to the Americas, the only Genus in this Family, 
   <i>Krameria</i> consists of a number of desert plants that are 
   partially parasitic on other plants. A couple have had minor 
   medicinal uses, and ground roots have been used in Portugal 
   to dye wines ruby red. but I find no evidence of any other use 
   as food.</p>
