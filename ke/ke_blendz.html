A blender is basically a Smoothie making machine. It can also 
pur&eacute;e soups and other very liquid things. I find it suboptimal 
for other tasks, and, since I never make Smoothies, I used mine only 
rarely. This photo of my blender was taken as I prepared to donate it 
to a charity. It has been replaced by a 3 can Indian 
<a href="ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, a far more capable machine 
- and yes, the Mixie can make Smoothies too.

<p>There are many people who practically live on Smoothies, and to them 
a blender is an essential "always ready" appliance - but, real Smoothie 
addicts report Vitamix to be the only brand worth having. Others can't 
stand up to the constant high speed use. Vitamix has added a new "low 
cost" blender at only 2020 US $289. The regular home line runs from 
$389 to over $700. They have a professional version that's over 
$2,000.</p>
