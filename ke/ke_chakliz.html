<h1>Chakli Press / Sev Sancha</h1>
<br><img src="img/ke_chakli03d.jpg" alt="Brass Chakli Press with disks" class=mrg>

<p>[Thenkuzhal, nazhi (Tamil)]

<p>Deep fried snacks and breakfast items are very popular in India. Many 
of them are extruded using a press similar to the one in the photo. This 
press can extrude many shapes, as it comes with a selection of perforated 
disks (Jali) for popular forms and sizes.</p>

<p>The disks are 2.4 inches in diameter, and the unit is 4.5 inches to 
the top center. The body holds 1 cup (250 ml).</p>

<p>These presses and their products are particularly popular in southern 
India, but on the west coast as far north as Gujarat. they are also used in 
Sri Lanka and Indonesia.</p>

<p>Of course, this press can also be used for items that are not deep fried, 
but boiled or baked instead. The multi-hole disk with the largest holes 
would probably also work for German Sp&auml;etzle.</p>

<p>The names and forms of these items are extremely flexible, so don't 
be at all surprised by one form being called by the name given here for 
another form. The mix of flours used does more to define the product 
than the shape. Many forms are also produced by hand, rather than with 
the press, with the names sometimes prefixed by "Kai" (hand).</p>

<h2>Chakli</h2> &nbsp; [Chakkuli (Kannada); Dantkali (Odisha); Murukku (Tamil); 
Chakali (Marathi); Chakri (Gujarati); Chakralu, Jantikalu (Telugu); Chakri, 
Chakkuli (Konkani)]
<p>These deep fried items are quite popular in India, 
both as a snack, often from street vendors, or as a breakfast item. They are 
made from a mix of flours, Rice, Bengal Gram (desi chickpeas), and Black Gram 
(urad beans). These are mixed with various spices. They are made with a disk 
having a single star shaped hole, then coiled, and deep fried.

<h2>Murukku</h2> &nbsp; These deep fried items are quite popular in 
Tamil Nadu, often made in large quantity to serve during festivals. Made 
from a mix of Rice flour and Black Gram flour (urad beans), with various spices 
added, they are relatively hard. They can be made with a disk having three 
round holes and are usually randomly curled and deep fried. Mullu Muruku is 
a version with a rough texture for added crunchiness.

<h2>Pakoda Murukku</h2> &nbsp; Another form popular in Tamil Nadu, made from 
the same mix of Rice flour and Black Gram flour (urad beans) as the regular 
Murukku. They can be made with the disk having four slots in it, then deep 
fried.

<h2>Sev / Omapodi</h2> &nbsp; This version is made from Besan (desi chickpea 
flour) with various spices added. It is often used as a topping for various 
dishes, and also mixed with other ingredients, such as Poha (beaten rice). 
It can be made with the multi-holed disk with the largest holes in the photo 
above, then deep fried.

<h2>Idiyappam</h2> &nbsp; [String Hoppers; Idiyappam, Noolappam, Noolputtu, 
Sevai (Tamil Nadu); Semige, Sem&eacute; da addae (Tulu); Chomai (Kannada);
Putu mayam (Malaysia); Putu mayang (Indonesia);]
<p>These are very popular in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, but also in Karala, 
Karnataka, Malaysia and Indonesia. Traditionally, they are made as small flat 
rovings of rice flour (the photo shows three piled up) using a press with 
a disk with very small holes. Traditionally, they are formed into tiny baskets 
and steamed, but they may also be formed in the depressions of 
<a href="kp_idliz.html"><b>Idli Steamer</b></a> trays for steaming. They 
are usually served with spicy sambars or curries and a chutney, for breakfast 
or dinner, but seldom at lunch.

<h2>Akar Kelapa</h2> &nbsp; This is an Indonesian version. It is made from 
Glutinous Rice flour, regular Rice Flour, White Sugar and Coconut Cream. 
It can be extruded in various forms, but the most common I see in photos 
is made in medium lengths using the disk with the single star shaped hole, 
the same as Chakli, but straight. They are then deep fried. The photo examples 
to the left look like they were made with a cookie press.
