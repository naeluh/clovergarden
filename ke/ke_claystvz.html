<span class=lrg>
This is the kind of stove woks are made for.</span> The heat is 
intense, close to the wok, and the highest heat is in the center where 
it belongs. This is almost impossible to achieve on a North American 
home stove. Burning charcoal is place in the top. Ashes fall through 
the holes and can be shoveled out through the door. There is enough 
space to get more fuel in without removing the wok.

<p>The stove in the photo is a medium sized one, 11 inches in diameter. 
I found I have a round iron grate that just fits this stove, quite 
convenient since this stove can be used for grilling as well as wok 
cooking. A grill basket could also be used.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was purchased from Hawaii 
Supermarket in Los Angeles (San Gabriel) for 2018 US $13.99. They also 
have smaller and larger versions, the largest being about 14 inches 
and costing $20.99. Stoves of this sort are also available on-line, 
but I see rather high prices for them.<p></p>
