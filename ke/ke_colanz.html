Colanders are free standing draining or straining devices, most of which 
hold 4 to 5 quarts. Today many are made of stainless steel with lots of 
holes punched in them, but mine is made the same as a wire strainer, except 
without handles and on a ring stand.  Others are made of plastic. Before 
the mid 20th century, most were made of enameled steel. The spin basket 
in most <a href="sspin.html"><b>Salad Spinners</b></a> is a fine colander. 
The Colander is an ancient device. Both bronze and clay versions have been 
found in Roman sites, but it certainly must date from prehistoric times. 

<p>Actually, I don't use a Colander at all, because hanging above my sink 
is a 10-1/2 inch wire strainer with helper handle that straddles my sink 
tubs just fine.</p>

<p>Here is one of the best of the modern stainless steel Colanders. It has far 
more holes than most, so will drain faster. It would be much easier to clean 
than my wire mesh colander, and I'd get one if I felt the need for a colander. 
It's the Bellemain 5 quart Micro-perforated colander, and costs about 2022 
US $20 on-line.
