<h1>Dehydrator</h1>

<span class=lrg>This is a specialty item that won't be needed in most 
kitchens, but is essential for some of us.</span> There are many 
dehydrators on the market to serve various needs. I chose this small 
Waring electric model for convenience, because my needs are on a fairly 
small scale, only occasional, and because it has an adequate number of 
trays. I am quite happy with it, but the fan is rather noisy - you don't 
want this thing running in your main living space. Some people, of 
course, will only settle for a solar dehydrator.

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; Do an on-line search for Dehydrator and you'll 
see many choices at many prices. Carefully consider your actual needs, 
trying to separate them from fantasy.<p></p>

<h3>Using:</h3> &nbsp;  Herbs dry very quickly, which is good because 
flavor hasn't time to retreat back into the stems - but be careful not 
to overdry. Drying a slab of salted beef will take a day and a half or 
more. The Shan Tua Nao fermented soybean disks shown in the photo 
above were quite dense, so took overnight at medium heat to be suitably 
dry.<p></p>
