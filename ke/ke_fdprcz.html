This is my full size food processor. It is a very powerful machine, 
and came with grating and slicing disks as well as sharp metal and 
dull plastic blades. This unit got great reviews, but for me, it is 
of very limited use. The reviewers must use this machine very 
differently from how I wish to use it, and some may have enough 
counter space to leave it out all the time, though I know most 
people have less than I have.

<p>Here are my complaints:</p>

<p><b>Liquids:</b> &nbsp; The central pillar is so short, it can take 
only very limited loads that have a lot of liquid. It is quite unsuitable 
for pur&eacute;eing soups and similar tasks, because it leaks all over 
the place. This is no longer a problem for me, as my new  
<a href="ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> is very good at that sort 
of work, and much easier to deploy, store and clean.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> &nbsp; For so many jobs, it's just too large. The 
<a href="ke_minprpz.html"><b>Mini-Prep</b></a> gets used more than 20 
times for every time this machine gets used.</p>
<p><b>Vegetables, etc:</b> &nbsp; When chopping vegetables, salads, or 
meats, by time it has them even, they are chopped too finely. I prefer 
to cut by hand so I have control over exact textures and sizes, and 
that's a lot easier to clean up after too.</p>
<p><b>Bulk / Weight:</b> &nbsp; I don't have infinite counter space, so 
this machine must be kept in an under counter cupboard. It is very heavy 
and very bulky, so difficult to store and difficult to deploy.</p>
<p><b>Cleaning</b> &nbsp; It is much more difficult to clean than 
other tools I have. The plastics are quite complex with a lot of places 
that are hard to clean out properly.</p>
