<h1>Garlic Press</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>This is a very useful, time saving device for recipes that want a lot 
of garlic cloves, or need the garlic chopped very fine. After running through 
the press, I usually chop the garlic to break up remaining membranes or 
fibers.</p>

<p>The photo example is the Oxo Good Grips Garlic Press, which I greatly 
favor. The rubber buttons make it easy to remove garlic that remains in the 
bowl of the device, and clears all the holes, making it very easy to clean. 
Also the hinge is very strong. I have had other garlic presses break after 
only moderate use, while this one has served for decades. 2022 US $18.99.</p>
