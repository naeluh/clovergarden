<h1>Electric Grill / Griddle</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>
Some cuisines, such as Southeast Asian and African, presume your 
kitchen fire is available most of the day, so grilling is convenient and 
much used. This is not necessarily so for us in the West. I 
needed something more practical than firing up the big charcoal grill for 
small jobs.</span>
<p>I tried using an Asian electric grill, but it took &nbsp; 
f o r e v e r &nbsp; to cook anything, because its conventional non-stick 
coating severely limited temperature. Grill design was not good and 
ingredients were difficult to manage and browned very unevenly.
Cleaning was also difficult.</p>
<p>I tried the Gotham Steel Electric Smoke-less Grill with Griddle, 
and found it quite satisfactory in design and performance for many of 
my needs, but if what you're looking for is a deep carcinogenic char, 
this is not for you. It's ceramic non-stick surface can withstand 
temperatures above 600&deg;F/316&deg;C without damage, so it runs at 
an acceptable temperature. It does, however, cook much differently 
from a flame grill, as food is heated only by the grill bars, and 
little heat comes up between them. Browning at the grill bars is 
definite but moderate.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; I purchased the model with the griddle for $70 
from Bed Bath and Beyond. An Internet search shows widely varying 
pricing, but beware, some of those offerings are for a smaller model, 
and some don't include the griddle.<p></p>

<h3>The Grill</h3>

<p><b>Performance:</b> &nbsp; Instructions say to give the grill 5 
minutes to heat up before applying food. This seems good enough, but 
another couple minutes wouldn't hurt. Especially when first heating up, 
the temperature distribution is uneven. It can get to 600&deg;F at the 
round end of the element on initial start-up, yet be unharmed. Once well 
warmed, but empty, the element goes on at 380&deg;F at the plug end and 
425&deg;F at the round tip. The element goes off at 440&deg;F at the 
plug end and 540&deg;F at the round tip. The grill bars out near the 
edge range between 250&deg;F and 350&deg;F depending on state of the 
main heater.</p>

<p>The unevenness of the heat may seem to be a disadvantage, but allows 
positioning foods that are not uniform in thickness. Also, items on 
the grill are very easy to reposition as needed.</p>

<p>Browning happens only at points where food touches the grill bars, 
so it is best with foods that are relatively flat, such as slabs of 
meat, chicken or fish, meat patties, and with small items such as 
sausages and skewers. Large uneven items such as Anaheim chilis and small 
uncut eggplants don't work so well, and should be sliced and/or 
flattened for grilling.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning:</b> &nbsp; This device cleans very easily. The ceramic 
non-stick surface of the grill is very slippery and food debris is 
usually easy to brush off under hot running water. During use, it is 
good to periodically wipe off food debris with a wad of paper towels, 
as it can eventually become hard to wash off. The drip pan is non-stick 
and removes from the frame for easy cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; The ceramic coating can be chipped. If stuff 
is stuck down really hard, don't try scraping it off until you have 
softened it with water and cleanser.</p>

<p><b>Health:</b> &nbsp; Because the highest temperatures are restrained 
to about 550&deg;F, this device is unlikely to produce the carcinogenic 
compounds flame grills are accused of.</p>

<h3>The Griddle</h3>

<p>On first heating up, the griddle's heat is very uneven, but it does 
equalize quite a bit when the light has gone out and then come back on. 
As with the grill, it is hottest opposite the temperature controller, 
but the difference seems a bit less. Since it can never be entirely 
even, foods should be positioned taking that into account.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend using it this way. Spread a small amount of 
very high temperature oil (Olive Pomace or Avocado) on the griddle. 
Position the temperature right between Medium and High, or as high 
as you can go without seeing any smoke at all. This will prevent 
sticking, even of eggs "sunny side up" so they can be moved around 
if need be and removed easily.
