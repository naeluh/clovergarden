<span class=lrg>
This device is not needed in most kitchens, but is essential to some 
"natural foods" enthusiasts, and to culinary explorers.</span> There 
are many grain mills on the market to serve various needs. I chose the 
one in the photo because I have a powerful KitchenAid stand mixer to 
drive it. There are stand-alone electric mills and hand cranked mills 
of varying quality and capacity.

<p>The unit in the photo is quite satisfactory. My 40 year old 
KitchenAid grain grinder was not - it didn't grind fine enough. While 
you can't expect a home mill to grind as fine as commercial flour 
(that is made using powerful roller mills), you do need reasonably fine. 
Some Coffee Grinders can grind fine enough for very small batches.</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; For a unit like the one pictured, before you 
use it, turn it to the finest setting and see if you can turn the stem 
by hand. If not, back it off a notch or you may damage your mixer. 
Also, take it apart and clean the burrs with cleanser, as they are 
probably coated with oil, and grinding grain uncleaned will jam it all 
up.</p>

<h3>Buying</h3> &nbsp; Do an on-line search for Grain Mills and you'll 
see many choices at many prices. Carefully consider your actual needs, 
trying to keep them separate from your fantasies.<p></p>

<h3>Using:</h3> &nbsp;  Thee mills are for grains, and other non-oily 
seeds. Do not try to grind oily things like sunflower seeds, coffee 
beans, etc. You will just clog up your machine.<p></p>

<h3>Maintaining:</h3> &nbsp; Keep it clean. Take it apart to clean, 
and dry it well before re-assembling. The burrs are generally bare 
iron, and they will rust if not completely dry.<p></p>
