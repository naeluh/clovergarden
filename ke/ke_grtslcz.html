<h1>Graters <small>&amp;</small> Slicers</h1>

<p>These devices are very convenient, and can often quickly do jobs 
that are difficult or nearly impossible with knives and mortars. 
On the other hand, there are jobs that knives and mortars do a lot 
better - use the right tool for the job</p>

<h2 class=lrg id="box">Box Grater</h2>

<p>When recipes tell you to grate something, this is the device they 
usually picture you using - it has been a kitchen standard for centuries. 
There are other sizes and shapes, but this is the standard, and large 
enough to grate many sizes of cheeses and vegetables effectively. It 
is always ready and very easy to clean.

<img src="img/ke_boxgrt05h.jpg" alt="Box Grater, Nail Holes Side" class=mrg>

The photo specimen is a standard size, stainless Steel box grater, of 
unknown brand. It has been in use in my kitchen for 40 years or more. 
The cutting surfaces measures 4 x 2-7/8 inches at the base and 3-1/4 x 
2-3/8 at the top. It is 9-1/2 inches tall, including the handle, with 
cutting surfaces 6-1/2 inches long.</p>
 
<p>The first photo shows the Large Hole and Small Hole sides. These 
cut things into medium strips and narrow threads. I probably use the 
small holes side the most, particularly for hard cheeses and to harvest 
lemon, lime, and orange zest. The big hole side I've used for soft 
cheeses, apples and other softer items.</p>

<p>The second photo shows the Nail Hole and Slicer sides. The nail hole 
side is particularly useful for grating ginger, onions, or other 
vegetables when your intent is to wrap them in cloth and wring out the 
juice for use in recipes. The slicer side is the most dangerous side, 
and I'd never used it, until I tested if for writing this page. It 
slices way thinner than I usually want things sliced, though I can 
see it as very useful when preparing some garnishes.<p>

<p>Clearly, this device must be used with care, but it is nowhere near 
as dangerous as a Mandolin (the slicer, not the musical instrument, 
which is dangerous only to finger tips). Where the Mandolin can take 
significant flesh, this device will only cause abrasions - except the 
slicer side (see above) which can cut, but not nearly as deeply.

<h2 class=lrg id="nutm">Nutmeg Grater</h2>

<br><img src="img/ke_grtnutm02e.jpg" alt="Nutmeg Grater" class=mrg>
If you have been using ground Nutmeg out of a spice jar, you have no 
idea what Nutmeg tastes like.  This grater lives in my spice drawer, 
right beside the jar of Nutmegs.  It takes only seconds to have real 
nutmeg flavor.

<h2 class=lrg id="micrp">Microplane&reg;</h2>

<br><img src="img/kn_micrp02d.jpg" alt="Microplane, Large, Coarse" class=mrg>
Unlike many graters, the Microplanes are very sharp, made from thin 
but hard stainless steel. They are available in various sizes and 
fineness. The one in the photo is a coarse and unusually large one. I got 
it to see how it worked taking the brown backing off pieces of coconut. 
It did a credible job of it, taking less strength but more time than 
a very sharp vegetable peeler. It did clog now and then, but the clogs 
were removed by a simple tap on the cutting board. It also does just fine 
for zesting a lemon or lime, though they sell smaller, finer ones for 
that. This one comes with a snap on plastic shield, to protect the 
cutting edges, and prevent accidents.

<h2 class=lrg id="drum">Drum Grater / Slicer</h2>

<br><img src="img/ke_grtdrm01g.jpg" alt="Drum Grater" class=mrg>
This grater / slicer set is made as an accessory to the KitchenAid 
Stand Mixer, but such devices are also available as stand-alone 
hand cranked tools. I have used this set for larger grating and 
slicing jobs for about 40 years. The main disadvantage is that items 
sliced in a drum come out curved.

<h2 class=lrg id="disk">Grating <small>&amp;</small> Slicing Disks 
<small>for</small> Food Processor</h2>

<br><img src="img/ke_grtdsk02g.jpg" alt="Grating and Slicing Disks" class=mrg>
<p>These are grating and slicing disks for a Food Processor. They stand 
on a stem so they are just below the top, and stuff shoved down the feed 
tube hits them immediately. They are available in various configurations, 
fine to coarse and thick to thin. These two came with my big KitchenAid 
Food Processor. I'm sure they work well, but I've never used them. I 
don't have counter space for the food processor, so I only bring it out 
when I really need it, and it's a <u>heavy</u> SOB. The appropriate 
spot on my counter is taken up by a big KitchenAid Stand Mixer, and 
that isn't going to change.

<h2 class=lrg id="mando">Mandolin</h2>

This is a very useful and time saving device when doing larger jobs. 
Good ones can cut to any thicknesses up to 3/8 inch, do wavy cuts, 
julienne, and cut potato fries. It is, however, a <b><u>Dangerous 
Device</u></b> and should not be operated by children, teens, or adults 
"under the influence". This important device has it's own 
<a href="kn_mandoz.html"><b>Mandolin</b></a> page.
