For many years I wondered what use I had for one of these. Then, one day, 
I was making an Indian Rasam, not as a major item, but as a sauce for 
Idlies - and I was in a hurry. I had to get out my mini-prep processor, 
pour the Rasam into it, run it for a few seconds, then pour it back in 
the pan for further processing. Then I had to clean the mini-prep and 
put it back.

<p>I realized, I could have used an immersion blender and done the 
job right there in the pan with a very easy clean-up. There are probably 
other times it would be convenient. The photo specimen cost 2020 US 
$34.97 and seemed a better deal to me than higher priced units which 
included a lot of accessories I'd never use. For me, this is an 
auxiliary unit, not a major appliance.</p>

<p>Cordless models are also available. They are much bulkier, needing 
space for both a motor and a battery, and are less powerful. There are 
also professional and industrial versions in many sizes, priced from $70 
to over $1,700. These are invariably corded.</p>
