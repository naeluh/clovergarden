<p>Some cuisines, such as Southeast Asian, presume your kitchen 
fire is available most of the day, so grilling a few small ingredients 
is quick and easy. This is not necessarily so for us in the West.
I needed to roast a few shallots, garlic cloves and ginger slices until 
browned. Doing this in the broiler is very inconvenient, difficult to 
control, uses a lot of gas, and heats up the kitchen.</p>
<p>The solution I found is a Japanese stovetop Grill Pan (Fish Grill). 
Unfortunately, the Japanese presume you will use it for fish, so the 
grate on top is too wide for many uses,  but I found small things roast 
just fine directly on the ceramic coated grid. The unit in the photo is 
7 x 9 inches (18 x 23 cm).</p>

<p>This device can also be used for heating roti or tortillas, toasting 
slices of bread, and many similar tasks.</p>
