<h1 class=s>Measuring Cups</h1>
<br><img src="img/ke_cupwd02g.jpg" alt="Measuring Cups, liquid and dry" class=mrg>

Measuring cups come in two styles - Liquid and Dry. The dry are particularly 
important for people doing baking, because recipe measures there are critical, 
and stupid cookbook publishers won't let the recipe writers use weights, which 
are much more accurate. Being able to shave off to rim level with a knife 
makes dry measuring much more accurate than in graduated liquid measures.

<p>I have read "expert" advice that one must not use the dry measures for 
liquids because there can be a meniscus (liquid level higher than the rim) 
"up to 30% of the volume". First, that 30% is absurd, and if you can't 
manage a silly meniscus by watching your fill, or simply pouring off a dash 
of the liquid, perhaps cooking isn't really your thing.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Measuring Spoons</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_spoons01f.jpg" alt="Measuring Spoons" class=mrg>
I do not accept measuring spoon sets that do not include 1/8 teaspoon 
size. It is a size common in recipes, or if you divide recipes into 
smaller amounts. Not having it also makes judging 1/16 teaspoon difficult. 
This is especially important for Indian cooking if you are using Pure 
Asafoetida (not Asafoetida Powder, which is diluted with rice flour). Pure 
Asafoetida is used in very small quantities.

<p>The photo shows the the spoons on a ring, but I would remove them from 
the ring and toss the ring. I would reject any set that could not be removed 
from its ring, or is fastened together by some other means. Having them 
together makes using them very clumsy.</p>

<p>The set in the photo is an old Oxo set, made before the company decided 
that all kitchen equipment should be black.
