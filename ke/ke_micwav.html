<h1>Microwave Oven</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>Most methods of cooking heat food from the outside in, and it often takes 
quite a while for the heat to penetrate to the center. A Microwave Oven 
heats evenly through the food, <u>provided it contains water</u>. It will 
actually be coolest on the outside surface. This is done by exposing the 
food to powerful high radio frequency electromagnetic radiation. This 
radiation excites water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate 
which is evident to us as heat.</p>

<p>Since the radiation penetrates the food completely, it will heat it 
evenly, but, of course, there will be no browned crust or such niceties. 
The microwave really cooks by steaming - but it is fast, and is also useful 
for quickly thawing frozen foods.</p>

<p>Countertop microwave ovens can be had for 2022 US $80 to $250 or so. 
Since I don't have children or a husband demanding instant gratification, 
I have never felt the need for a microwave oven.
