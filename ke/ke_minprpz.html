<p>Especially for me as an explorer of ethnic cuisines, and for fast 
party prep, this machine has been so essential that I bought a spare 
"just in case". It is used many, many times more than my full size 
processor. It has just the one blade, which chops with the sharp side 
and grinds with the dull side, but this is all you need for a great 
many tasks. It is small, light, far easier to deploy, and far easier 
to clean than my full size processor.</p>

<p>It can't achieve the texture I can get with the big 
<a href="mortar.html"><b>Thai Granite Mortar</b></a> (no household 
appliance can), I have often used it to rough grind ingredients to 
be finished in the Mortar. This saves a whole lot of pounding with 
a 3 pound pestle, at the cost of a little clean-up. Some tasks will 
now be taken over by my new <a href="ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, 
which is also easy to deploy, but that machine is just way too violent 
for a lot of prep tasks.</p>

<p>At this writing (Nov-2020) this 3 cup machine is still available at 
2020 US $39.95, but I think it is being replaced by a 4 cup version 
at $44.95 (taller jar).</p> 

<p>Note: &nbsp; The lid of these units has two small vent holes within 
the handle area. I drilled one of these a little bigger so I 
could add liquids without stopping the machine.</p>
