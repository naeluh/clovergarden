<h1>Indian Mixie - Mixer Grinder</h1>
<br><img src="img/ke_mixie04g.jpg" alt="Indian 'Mixie' Mixer Grinder" class=mrg>

This type of machine is very popular in India and Sri Lanka. It is 
similar to an American blender, but better adapted to mixing and 
grinding rather than making smoothies. It can handle both dry and wet 
grinding. A number of models are available in North America priced from 
about 2020 US $120 to $180. The same model will vary in price depending 
on how many jars it comes with and if one is an extractor or juicer. 
The photo specimen cost 2020 US $139.99 from Amazon.

<p>Some blenders have more powerful motors, but they cannot do many jobs 
a Mixie can do. The difference is in the geometry. A blender jar 
narrows down to a very small blade. This works fine for very liquid 
recipes, like smoothies, but with more solid recipes, it just spins. 
The Mixie jars are wide at the bottom with blades the width of the jar.<p>

<p>The Mixie in the photo, using the large jar, was able to grind 6 cups 
of soaked rice into a very fine Idli batter in two batches, and just a 
couple minutes each. The same job with a blender took more batches, and  
more than 20 minutes, with lots of stopping to scrape down the rice. The 
finished batter wasn't anywhere near as smooth.</p>

<p>A Mixie is the machine most households in South Asia use to grind 
batter for Idlis and Dosas. The <a href="ke_wetgrndz.html">
<b>Wet Grinder</b></a> is used in situations where more volume is 
needed, or for people very fussy about their batter.</p>

<p>The small jar is fantastic for grinding Masalas, Spices, and Chutneys. It 
can handle spice mixes that include some oil, something a spice grinder can't 
do, and nor can a blender. This machine is superb for many of the ethnic 
cuisines I work with, including cultures that don't have Mixies. It is 
fabulous for making Thai Curry Pastes - but some things will still need the 
big <a href="mortar.html"><b>Granite Mortar</b></a>.
</p>

<p>Can a Mixie compete with a Blender for making smoothies? I don't usually 
make smoothies, but for testing I made a few in the Mixie, and it worked 
fine. Real smoothie junkies say the only blender worth bothering with is 
the Vitamix, which starts at about 2021 US $350 for the "entry level" unit. 
I can't compare in detail because I don't, and won't, own a Vitamix. In any 
case, my blender (Osterizer) has been assigned to storage and will probably 
be given to charity.</p>
