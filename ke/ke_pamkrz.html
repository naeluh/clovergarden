Neither dried pasta nor fresh pasta is inherently "better", but they are 
definitely different. They are each favored in parts of Italy, or for 
particular recipes. Fresh pasta is usually rolled out thin and cut into 
strips. This type of machine makes both rolling and cutting easier and 
more uniform in thickness and width.  It is a good thing to have in a 
household that often makes fresh pasta, but of no use in households that 
don't. 

<p>Similar machines are available as attachments to powerful stand mixers, 
like the KitchenAid.
