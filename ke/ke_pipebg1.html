[Pastry Bag, Cake Decorating Set]
<p>
I have never decorated a cake in my life, nor made fancy pastries - so 
why do I consider this an essential kitchen tool - and how did I wear 
out the old one that came with those metal nozzles?</p>
<p>this is very easy to answer. Cuisines of the world are full of 
wonderful stuffed things, stuffed eggs for a simple example, that are 
just too much trouble to make - <u>unless</u> you have a piping bag. 
Then they become ridiculously easy. Just put your stuffing in the bag 
and squirt it into or onto whatever you are making.</p>
<p>When you buy a set, make sure it has a 1/2 inch plain nozzle. That's 
actually the only nozzle I've ever used - because I don't decorate cakes. 
If your's doesn't have that nozzle, they are available on the Internet, 
for instance the Ateco 806 1/2" Plain #6 Pastry Tube (2015 US $1.09). The 
version shown in the photo uses cheap disposable bags, but I wash the 
bags and reuse them anyway - because I'm even cheaper than they counted 
on.
