<h1>Pickle Press</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>In Japanese households, impromptu pickles are often made form various 
vegetables. A pickle press makes that easy. The photo shows a small 1.6 
litre press, but there are larger ones available, generally round rather 
than rectangular like this one.</p>

<p>The pressure is provided by a spring in the center column. The knob 
at the top can increase the pressure or lower the pressure plane as 
needed.</p>
