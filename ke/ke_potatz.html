<br><img src="img/ke_pottool02g.jpg" alt="Potato Masher &amp; Ricer" class=mrg>
This photo shows a Potato Ricer, and a conventional Potato Masher. These can 
also be used for other root vegetables, and the ricer can have uses beyond root 
vegetables. Today, cooking researchers say to forget the conventional Masher 
and use only the Ricer for making mashed potatoes. This will result in potato 
mash that is more creamy and less gluey.

<p>When buying a Ricer, make sure the band around the bowl cannot slip. In the 
photo example it is hard against the rim of the bowl so very secure. I had one 
that was less secure and could slip, making the ricer useless. A lot of 
pressure is involved with ricing potatoes.</p>
