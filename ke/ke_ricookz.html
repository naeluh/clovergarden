<h1>Rice Cooker</h1>

<p>In Japanese homes, this appliance is a "Must Have". The photo shows the 
simplest version, costing less than 2021 US $20, but there are computer 
controlled versions selling for up to $300, or even more.<p>

<p>This photo example is the simplest, but is adequate for most American 
home kitchens. I did have to add a cord switch so it could be turned off 
without pulling the plug. In China, Korea, or Japan, it might never be 
turned off - always either cooking rice or keeping it warm.</p>

<p>More expensive units have special programs for white rice, brown rice, 
mixed grains, porridge, stews and slow cooking. My needs are much more 
simple, and I only pull out a rice cooker for parties (I like the glass top 
for that), or for making a batch of rice for fried rice recipes. My daily 
rice is 1/4 cup (raw) cooked on the stovetop, way too little for a rice 
cooker.</p>

<p>The basic operating principle is simple. When the rice has absorbed all 
the water, the temperature in the bottom of the pan starts to rise. At a 
set temperature, the cooker switches from "cook" to "keep warm" - except my 
antique Hitachi - it turns off, but you have to push the "keep warm" toggle 
by hand.</p>

<p>What this all means is that you need to know your rice and how much water 
it needs. Be aware, most ratings are by one cup of rice. For two cups of 
rice you need a little less water per cup, and even less for 3 cups. Be 
aware: the ratios on our <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html"><b>Rice</b></a> 
pages are per American standard cup, not Japanese rice cup.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; <b><u>CAUTION</u>:</b> &nbsp; These devices are 
measured in cups, but the cup measure is a Japanese rice measuring cup. 
It's 6 ounces, while a standard American cup is 8 ounces. A 4 cup unit 
will hold only 3 cups American.
<p></p>

<h3>Health:</h3> &nbsp; After cooking the rice, the cooker switches to 
"keep warm" mode. This is not unsafe. Eventually, the rice will become 
sour, but it's still not dangerous, just not pleasant to eat (except for 
some special ethnic recipes).<p></p>
