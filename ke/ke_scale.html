<h1>Scale</h1>

<p>This is a "must have" extremely important kitchen item. and not expensive. 
The photo example can be had for as low as 2022 US $20. A digital scale of 
this type can display weights in Pounds/Ounces, Ounces, and Grams, and switch 
from one to another for conversion. An extremely useful feature is to provide 
weight less tare. You place a container on the scale and hit the Tare Button. 
The scale zeros, so the weight given will be the net weight, the weight of 
the ingredient you put into the container.</p>

<p>For cooking weight is far more accurate than any other measure. Folks 
publishing baking recipes plead for being able to give measures in weights, 
which are far more accurate, but cookbook publishers insist on volume. 
Publishers are not yet ready to leave the 19th century.</p>

<p>The Escali scale in the photo is certainly not the prettiest scale I've 
owned, but it is the best. It's start-up time is short, it's controls are 
simple and effective, and best of all, it stays on for long enough, which 
many scales do not do. Maximum weight is 11 pounds, common to many kitchen 
scales.</p>
