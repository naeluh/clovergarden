[Impulse Sealer]
<p>
Around 32 years ago I bought an Impulse Sealer for my business. It never  
get a lot of use for the business - but it was situated in the kitchen, 
and immediately proved its worth as a kitchen tool.</p>

<p>I always considered it an "essential", but didn't realize just how 
essential it was until it stopped working, last Sunday afternoon. I 
immediately ordered a replacement from ULINE, which was delivered 
Tuesday, but I had cooking projects on Monday, and my kitchen was 
crippled. I couldn't package anything. I couldn't reseal packages 
of ingredients that I had opened. It was awful.</p>

<p>The photo shows the new one (same as the old one) equipped with 
a roll of V-fold heat shrink film and a heat gun to shrink it, but 
it gets most use sizing and sealing much stronger 2-mil poly bags, 
and resealing the bags ingredients come packed in. It has a precision 
timer that can be adjusted to get exactly the seal you want on various 
types and thicknesses of plastic. This machine cost 2019 US $123 plus 
shipping.</p>

<p>I am aware there are many kitchen bag sealers available, both 
less and more expensive than my industrial sealer. Unfortunately, I 
have no experience with any of them, so my ability to comment is 
limited. Most include vacuum sealing, but I've never felt a pressing 
need for vacuum. Also, from the photos, I don't think most of those 
sealers will work well with bags filled with soups, stews, marinating 
fluids, or things soaking in water, uses very common in my kitchen. 
I'm plenty happy with plain 9x12 2-mil poly bags, which I buy from 
ULINE for 2019 US $37 per 1000, about a year and a half's supply.</p> 

<p>I don't consider the Shrink Wrap feature of my setup important, 
but I have it, so I do use it, but it's not nearly as secure as the 
2-mil poly. A 2000 foot roll of V-fold shrink film costs about 2019 
US $115 and lasts me about 4 years.</p>
