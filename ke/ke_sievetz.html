A set of sieves like this one is very useful where material is pounded 
in a mortar or on a stone and a specific grain size is desired. After 
pounding, the material is sieved, and that which doesn't fall through 
goes back to be pounded more. This set was purchased from an Armenian 
market in Los Angeles about 40 years ago, and a similar set may be pretty 
difficult to find in North America today. Many sieve sets are available, 
but they are "soil sieves", and far too coarse for culinary use.
