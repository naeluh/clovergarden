Skimmers are very important tools when making soup stock and in many 
other ways, including small ones for skimming tea. <p></p>

<h3>Soup Skimmer</h3> &nbsp; This is the center device in the photo. 
It is a kitchen workhorse anywhere soup stocks are made in volume, 
particularly to skim off the foamy crud from the top of the water as 
the makings for stock come to a boil.<p></p>

<h3>Fine Asian Skimmers</h3> &nbsp; These are right and left in the 
photo. They have an amazingly fine wire fabric that strains similar to 
muslin but many times faster. I use the large one as a general skimmer, 
especially when making small batches of stock or parboiling beef. I 
also use it as a strainer when pouring a finished stock through it before 
reheating it and putting it up in jars. This eliminates even the smallest 
particles that get through a regular strainer.<p></p>

<h3>Spider Skimmer</h3> &nbsp; This has its own 
<a href="ke_spider1.html"><b>Spider Skimmer</b></a> page, as it is used 
mostly with oils, but it is also very good at removing things from 
water, especially things that try to escape - it sneaks up on them 
easily.<p></p>
