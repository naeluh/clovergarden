Slotted spoons are an abomination, poorly designed for any use. 
I don't have one in my kitchen. The Slotted Skimmer in the photo is 
far superior, with more capacity, and a shape that can pick things 
out from a deep pot and get in close to the sides. If you need more 
delicacy, just tilt it and use one corner.

<p>The photo example was made long ago by Robinson Knife, now 
Robinson Home Products, and they no longer manufacture anything. The 
only one I find available today is the 12 1/2" Stainless Steel Slotted 
Skimmer from Chef Craft, which has almost exactly the same geometry. 
Users are delighted with it - reviews running 4.7 star out of 5. Many 
say they had been searching long and hard for one like this. Buy one now - 
once you have used one of these, you'll never go back. 2022 US $6.46 on-line.
