This is an essential for almost all cuisines, unless you like doing a 
whole lot of pounding in a big <a href="mortar.html">
<b>Stone Mortar</b></a>. I use this grinder almost daily, so it's always 
on the counter, where it takes very little space, and it's easy to clean. 
It's an excellent companion to the <a href="ke_mixiez.html">
<b>Mixie</b></a> because it can grind amounts far smaller than the Mixie 
can. What it can't do is grind wet or oily things, but the Mixie can do 
that, and is far faster for large amounts - it can grind whole spices 
enough for a 4 oz jar in 4 seconds, whereas this grinder would have to 
do it in batches. 

<p>You probably don't want to use it also as your coffee grinder, unless 
you like spice flavored coffee. This Krups unit can be had for as low as 
2020 US $14, and will last for years.</p>
