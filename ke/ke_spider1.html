A spider skimmer is the very best device for scooping things out of 
hot oil, taking far less oil with it than any other device. If I'm 
frying something in very shallow oil, I often use the flat slotted 
turner to load items into the spider to drain a few seconds before 
transferring them to drain on paper towels.
<p>The spider is also great for scooping things out of boiling water. 
Water slips through it so smoothly that floating items have no 
warning until it's too late to get away.</p>
<p>The all stainless steel type shown in the photo is less picturesque 
than the traditional Chinese versions made with laced wire, but is far 
easier to clean. This type is now commonly available in Asian markets 
here in Los Angeles.</p>
