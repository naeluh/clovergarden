<h1>Sprouting Jar</h1>

Sprouting Beans, Peas and Lentils, as well as some other seeds, 
greatly changes their nutritional value, significantly increasing 
vitamins and protein. This happens early in the sprouting process, 
so sprouts "India style", as shown in the photo, have already changed 
considerably. It also shortens cooking time, but doesn't shorten 
soaking time, as the beans or seeds have to have the full soaking 
time as if cooked unsprouted.

<p>The most common way to sprout legumes is in a Mason canning jar 
with a screened lid. The rig shown in the photo has a stand to hold 
the jar at an angle so it drains well, but setting a jar in a bowl 
will also work.<p>

<p>The rig in the photo cost less than 2020 US $13 from Amazon, and 
came with two lid rings, two screens and two stands. The jar I had 
many years from a set with a plastic screened lid, but the plastic 
had shrunk so much it was very difficult to screw on.</p>

<p>Moth Beans are very popular to sprout in India, because the sprout 
quickly. The ones in the jar are ready to cook 24 hours after soaking.

<p><b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; Don't sprout Red Kidney Beans - they are 
highly toxic until at least 10 minutes at a boil.</p>
