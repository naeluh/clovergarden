<h1>Sausage Stuffer</h1> 
<hr class=hr2>

<p>This is a device for real sausage enthusiasts. It is highly recommended 
over using a meat grinder with the sausage stuffing adapters, as the 
screw feed of that device is too slow and will heat the meat too much. 
This model by Desensa can be purchased for about 2022 US $76, and will 
handle up to 5 pounds of meat. It comes with four stuffing tubes to fit 
four sizes of casings.</p>
