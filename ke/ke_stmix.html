<h1>Stand Mixer</h1>
<p>Stand mixers are of great importance in kitchens that do a lot of baking, 
pancake making, and similar tasks. I don't do a lot of baking, so I use mine 
less often - and many of my uses involve the various accessories that are 
driven by the power port at the top front.</p>

<p>The photo specimen is my KitchenAid 5-1/2 quart model which is now over 
40 years old. The first KitchenAid mixer was Model K, released in 1937. 
The appearance has hardly changed since then, and they have been at the 
very top of nearly all 3rd party reviews from then to the current day.
It is basically a miniature of the Hobart floor standing planetary mixers 
seen in bakeries and food processors. Hobart originally owned KitchenAid, 
which now belongs to Whirlpool. Hobart still makes mixers up to 60 quarts.
</p>

<p>It appears the 5 quart is now being phased out (Jan 2022) and is available 
at a reduced price. The current 6 quart costs 2022 US $530 MSRP, but can be 
found at a lower price. The Tilt-Head models are less powerful, but most 
people find them to be just fine for kitchen use, and they are less expensive. 
There are several models starting with the new Artisan 5 qt at $429 MSRP 
down to $300 MSRP for the classic 4.5 qt. Certified refurbs are also often 
available at a significantly lower price. Higher priced models are available 
for both lines.</p>

<p>The power hub attachments from the Model K still work on all current models, 
and those from current models would still work with the Model K.

<h2 class=lrg>Mixer Attachments</h2>
<p>Pictured here are the attachments I own and have found useful. Other 
available attachments are listed below. Unfortunately, there is not an 
Indian style coconut grater attachment - legal probably said "No F'n Way! 
We couldn't afford the insurance!".</p>

<h2>Meat / Food Grinder</h2>
<p>
I wan't too happy with the plastic grinder KitchenAid sells, so I bought 
this all metal Kenome unit, with which I am quite satisfied. It was purchased 
for $2021 US $36, and there are several very similar ones available for 
between 2022 US $36 and $99.

<h2>Grain Mill</h2>
<p>
The original KitchenAid grain mill was pretty useless, but this new model 
works very well. For details on this unit see our 
<a href="ke_grnmillz.html"><b>Grain Mill</b></a> page. This one is 
2022 US $149 MSRP, but available for $130. There is another grain mill by 
Kitchenwin that fits KitcheAid mixers and sells for $60, but I know nothing 
about it.

<h2>Drum Grater / Slicer / Shredder</h2>
<p>
This is a very useful device that can save a lot of time. This is an older 
KitchenAid model, their current model has cylinder shaped drums rather than 
conical, and is 2022 US $65 MSRP, but available for $49. There are many 
competitive devices, both conical and cylindrical, from many manufacturers, 
almost all of which are below $49.
