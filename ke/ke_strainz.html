<h1>Mesh Strainers</h1>

Strainers of several sizes should be in every kitchen. I get the most use 
from a 7 inch, and plenty of use from a 10 inch with helper handle which 
straddles my sink very conveniently. I have, for many years, used a smaller 
nylon strainer like the one in the photo for washing rice, because standard 
American wire strainers were too coarse to keep grains from escaping.

<p>The two wire strainers in the photo are Asian, and have a very much finer 
mesh than the standard American strainer, but today, there are many choices for 
mesh fineness available in North America.</p>
