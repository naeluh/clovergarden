<h1>Kitchen Thermometers</h1>

<p>Here we have just a few of the hundreds of temperature measuring 
devices available today. The devices shown I have used very successfully, 
and have given years of service. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: &nbsp; A number of 
the units shown are from ThermoWorks, and are available <u>only</u> 
directly from ThermoWorks. Some Asian knock-offs closely mimic 
ThermoWorks designs and trade dress, but may not measure up in quality, 
accuracy, or durability.</p>

<h2 id="inst">Instant Read Thermometers</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thrmpn02e.jpg" alt="ThermoWorks Thermapen Mk4" class=mrg>
<p>This type is the first type of thermometer you should buy. It is great 
for measuring the inside temperature of meats, cakes, etc. and for 
accurately reporting the temperature of water. It will also report oil 
temperatures, but you have to get a little close for comfort if the oil 
is really hot or bubbling. "Instant" means 2 to 4 seconds for good ones.
<p>
<p>The unit in the photo is a top-of-the line ThermoWorks Thermapen Mk4, 
which has many advanced features, and goes to 575&deg;F/300&deg;C. 
Cost is 2020 US $99.99. The ThermoWorks little ThermoPop is also very 
highly thought of at $34, and also goes to 575&deg;F. Other units are 
available from other manufacturers on the Internet for $15 on up. The 
unit you select should go to at least 500&deg;F/260&deg;C.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="dial">Classic Dial Thermometers</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thrmdl02h.jpg" alt="Dial Thermometer" class=mrg>
<p>Once called "instant read" thermometers, these are far slower than 
the best electronic devices, and accuracy is not as tight, but tight 
enough for most cooking needs. The one in the photo is obviously only 
for deep frying and candy making due to it's fat probe. Others have 
thin pointed probes suitable for measuring the inside of roasts or 
turkey thighs. There are many models available on the Internet starting 
at about 2020 US $8.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2 id="ir">Infrared Thermometers</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thermir01h.jpg" alt="Infrared Thermometer" class=mrg>
<p>
This is practically a "must have" for pan frying, deep frying and even 
stir frying. Know instantly and accurately what your oil temperature 
is for precision control - without getting your hands close to the hot 
oil. There are currently dozens of units available on the Internet from 
2020 US $16 to over $150.</p>

<h3>Warning:</h3> Due to COVID-19, the market is flooded with infrared 
thermometers for measuring forehead temperatures. These report an adjusted 
temperature, not the true temperature. They are usually white in color. 
An industrial or culinary unit will give a forehead temperature around 
4&deg;F/2.5&deg;C lower than internal body temperature.<p></p>
 
<p>The unit in the photo to the left is Electronic Specialties EST-35,
available through the Internet at for as low as US $36. It features a 
bright laser beam for precision aiming and measures surface temperatures 
from -22&deg;F to 500&deg;F/260&deg;C. With a response time of less 
than 1 second, it's really great for measuring hot oil and other 
materials that are rapidly changing temperature - and you can measure 
from a safe distance. I currently use my ThermoWorks IR-IND - but that's 
wretched excess for cooking - up to 1400&deg;F/760&deg;/C.</p> 

<p>This type unit is useless for measuring water temperatures or items 
below freezing. It measures surface temperature, "surface" meaning 
exactly the surface, and the surface of hot water and frozen objects 
is always very far from the internal temperature due to evaporation 
and condensation.

<h2 id="ovc">Classic Oven Thermometers</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thermovn01c.jpg" alt="Dial Oven Thermometer" class=mrg>
<p>Oven thermometers of this type are still quite useful, though they 
have the disadvantage of often being knocked down and bouncing around 
when stuff is put into and taken out of the oven. They also can only 
be read by opening the oven door, quickly changing the temperature 
within. These can be had for 2020 US $5 and up. The one in the photo 
has obviously had some use.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="ovp">Probe Oven Thermometer</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thrmdt03e.jpg" alt="ThermoWorks Dot Probe Themometer" class=mrg>
<p>This unit, the ThermoWorks Dot, is very highly thought of as a 
replacement for the Classic Oven Thermometer, and the probe can also be 
inserted into roasts or turkey thighs to monitor meat temperatures. It 
has a single high temperature alarm and a strong magnet in the back to 
hold it to metal surfaces. It is extremely easy to use, unless you need 
the advanced features of the ChefAlarm or similar, and is compatible 
with several different ThermoWorks probes. The Dot costs 2020 
US $43. Other brands are available as low as $15 (no alarm).
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="ova">Probe Cooking Alarm</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_thrmal02e.jpg" alt="ThermoWorks ChefAlarm Cooking Alarm" class=mrg>
<p>This is the high end unit for controlling oven cooking, very highly 
regarded by users and reviewers alike. I used a Pyrex brand unit for a 
couple years, but the ThermoWorks ChefAlarm in the photo proved far 
easier to use, with a lot more features, and much sturdier construction. 
It can also accept other professional probes. With both high and low 
alarms, I have used this unit to control my oven to within 90&deg;F and 
105&deg; for many hours with very little attention. The probe can also be 
inserted into roasts or turkey thighs to monitor meat temperatures. It's maximum 
temperature is 700&deg;F/370&deg;C. This unit costs 2020 US $64.

<h3>Disclaimer:</h3> 
<p>All ThermoWorks units included here were purchased by me personally 
at full price, or when on sale at ThermoWorks. Neither I nor Clovegarden 
have any relationship with ThermoWorks except as a customer. I just find 
their products outstanding and worth the price.</p>
