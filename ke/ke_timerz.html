<h1>Kitchen Timers</h1>

<p>Kitchen timers with alarms can save a lot of "accidents" in a busy 
kitchen, especially for things in the oven that cannot be seen and are 
easily forgotten. There are a great many available with a wide range 
of features, and prices from for $4 to $59.</p>

<h2 id="ktc">Kitchen Timer, Counter &amp; Magnetic</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_timoz5h.jpg" alt="Ozeri Kitchen Timer" class=mrg>
<p>Counter-top Timers, often with a back magnet to stick to metal 
surfaces are available in a very wide range of prices and complexity. The 
Ozeri unit in the Photo is an example from a bit above the low cost end, 
about 2020 US $6, and is very easy to use. It can time to just over 
1-1/2 hours (99 minutes) and also has a stop watch mode. Similar units 
that can time more hours cost just a couple dollars more, and 2 timer 
units can be had for about $12.</p>

<p>At the very high end is the ThermoWorks TimeStack, which has 4 timers 
that each can time to 99 hours, or act as stop watches. It has a very 
wide range of advanced features, including recording your own voice 
alarms so you can hear exactly what has finished cooking without even 
looking at the timer. Cost is 2020 US $59. Their single timer version 
also goes to 99 hours and costs 2020 US $29, but doesn't have voice 
recording.

<h2 id="ktp">Kitchen Timer, Pocket</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_timer02d.jpg" alt="ThermoWorks TimeStick" class=mrg>
The unit in the photo is a ThermoWorks Time Stick, which has become 
extremely popular for it's small size (4-1/4 inches long), portability, 
durability, and ease of use with just one hand. It is much favored for 
use outdoors, as in competitive cook-offs. By request of their customers 
they now also make a 3 timer unit, the same shape and just a little bit 
larger, that is still very easy to use with one hand.
<p>Both versions have very audible alarms, can time to 99 hours, and can 
also function as stop watches. There are many kitchen timers on the 
market, but nobody else makes anything like this one. Cost is 2020 US 
$25, or $35 for the three timer version.
