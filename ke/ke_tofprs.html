<h1 class=s>Tofu Press</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>Blocks of tofu come packed in tubs of water. This protects the tender 
tofu from mechanical damage, and keeps it fresh. When I first started using 
tofu, it only lasted a few days in an unopened tub, but today, it lasts for 
weeks, even months. But for use, especially in Japan, it is generally pressed 
to remove a lot of the packing water. This makes if firmer, and makes it 
more readily absorb flavors from the ingredients it is cooked with. </p>

<p>There are quite a few Tofu Presses on the market. I chose this Bamboo 
Press, because it is so picturesque, and it will easily serve my needs, 
as for me, Tofu is an occasional item. There are plastic ones that are 
easier to use and easier to clean.</p>

<h2>Tofuture Tofu Press</h2>
<p>This Tofu Press seems very well thought of. Pressure is provided by 
silicone rubber bands and it isn't much bigger than the block of tofu, so 
it won't take too much fridge space. It sells for about 2022 US $25.15.
