<h1>Torch - Map Gas or Propane</h1>
<br><img src="img/ke_torch01i.jpg" alt="Map Gas Torch" class=mrg>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>I consider this absolutely a kitchen essential</span> - 
though I've never seen such a torch recommended, or even mentioned, in any 
cookbook, recipe, or cooking article. It will save you many hours of effort 
and frustration, within almost any cuisine on the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>The yellow cartridge in the photo means "Map Gas" (actually the gas mix 
that replaced map gas), which burns hotter than propane, and I recommend it. 
Propane (blue cartridge) is not quite as efficient, but works well if the 
flame is fairly wide. Do not attempt to use Map Gas with a torch designed for 
Propane, but the pictured torch can also burn Propane. Map gas is more 
expensive, but, hey, a single cartridge lasts me at least three years in 
normal kitchen use.</p>

<p>You will find below suggestions for using this torch to peel various 
vegetables, but it'll also burn the fuzz off a freshly feathered chicken, 
or a few stray hairs off a pig foot. It can also burn the char off stove 
burners and be used for repairing plumbing, lifting floor tiles, blistering 
paint and even browning those fancy Cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e deserts 
(if you hold it way back - but BurnsOmatic has a more expensive model with 
a knob that can turn the flame down). Of course you need something to put 
the vegetables on when torching them. I use a Mexican steel comal, but an 
inverted skillet will work fine.</p>

<p>In addition, J. Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt, in his book <i>The Wok</i> presents 
a method for achieving the famous <i>Wok Hei</i> flavor of Cantonese 
restaurants by pouring the food out on a baking sheet, singeing it with the 
torch, then pouring it back into the wok for finishing.</p>

<h3>Bell Peppers:</h3>
<br><img src="img/ke_bell01h.jpg" alt="Blackened Pepper" class=mrg>
Every cookbook will give you one to three methods for skinning bell 
peppers, necessary for most non-salad recipes. All these methods work 
about as well, which is to say, "not at all well". The typical bell 
pepper in the photo was charred coal black with the map gas torch in 
1-1/2 minutes, with only a few seconds of setup time - and it was still 
nice and crisp, hardly even warm. It took another 35 seconds to brush 
the skin off under running water. No holding in a bag required.
<p>The only downside, and for only a few recipes, is that the pepper is 
still totally raw. That's an advantage for most recipes, but some presume 
you will use their inefficient method, so the pepper will be cooked by 
time the skin is charred. For those recipes, just steam them a minute or 
two after brushing off the skin - you'll still be way ahead in time, 
effort and mess.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Tomatoes:</h3>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv11h.jpg" alt="Blackened Tomato" class=mrg>
The standard method for skinning tomatoes is to scald them one minute in 
boiling water, quench in cold water, then core and peel. The tomato in 
the photo was charred black in 35 seconds with the map gas torch, with 
only a few seconds set-up time and no need to bring water to a boil or 
clean the pot afterwards. Brushing the skin off under running water took 
another 30 seconds. It was perfect for use raw because there was no 
cooking, the torch barely warmed it up. No, the tomato didn't have a 
charred flavor - you'd have to torch it at least twice as long to get 
that. 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Eggplants:</h3>
<br><img src="img/ns_eggplp01h.jpg" alt="Whole Eggplant" class=mrg>
Just so you know - the torch <u>Does Not Work</u> at all well on 
eggplants of any size. For large ones use a very sharp "Y" shaped 
vegetable peeler. Small ones usually need not be peeled (unless they are 
white - white ones have very tough skins). Roasting on the grill or in 
an oven or broiler works better than the torch.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Chilis - Fresh</h3>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv6h.jpg" alt="Blackened chilis" class=mrg>
Here the torch really shines. All the chilis in the photo took only 
seconds to blacken, literally. No, there was not a hint of chili fumes - 
I only encounter those when cleaning up my tools and working surfaces 
with hot water, wow!
<p>All that remains now is to brush off the skins under running water,  
using a regular vegetable brush or similar. They brush off very easily. 
If a few flakes still cling to the chili, that's not a problem, and may 
enhance flavor in some recipes. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Dried Chilis</h3>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv8e.jpg" alt="Blackened chili" class=mrg >
In both Mexico and India, dried chilis are often dry pan roasted. 
This enhances their flavor and makes them flexible. They are done when 
they are blackened but not burned.
<p>The torch can also be used, and is very fast, but must be used with 
care, and from a greater distance than for fresh chilis. At the first 
hint of smoke, pull back and let that part cool while doing another 
part. The dried New Mexico chili in the photo was torch roasted, with 
considerable care, and did not taste burned. In fact, it was delicious - 
I ate the whole thing just as it was.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Cactus Pads (Nopales)</h3>
<br><img src="img/xtx_nopal12h.jpg" alt="Prepared Cactus Pad" class=mrg >
The torch makes quick work of disarming this difficult to handle 
vegetable, burning the spines to nothing in seconds. It can then be 
handled without pain while preparing it for recipes. The cactus pad 
in the photo is prepared and ready to slice. You will find a lot more 
detail on our <a href="../ingred/cc_nopalz.html">Nopales - Prickly 
Pear Pads</a> page. The torch works just as well disarming the fruits 
(Tunas). 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Prickly Chayotes</h3>
<br><img src="img/sq_chayot18h.jpg" alt="Two Prickly Chayotes" class=mrg >
These guys are really nasty, and they can get you right through 
plastic bags and even gloves, but the torch disarms them completely in 
a matter of seconds. Why deal with prickly chayotes at all? Because they 
have better flavor than those pale green ones.
