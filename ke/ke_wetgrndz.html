This machine is quite rare in North America, and a bit expensive (about 
2020 US $225 to $399), but is common in households in South India and

fried lacy Dosa pancakes are made often, or even daily. The Wet Grinder 
is the best tool for grinding the batter, if you need higher quantities 
than can be easily handled by the popular <a href="ke_mixiez.html">

Coimbatore district of western Tamil Nadu, India. Most wet grinders 
are manufactured in the Coimbatore district.<p>
