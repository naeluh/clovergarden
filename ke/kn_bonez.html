<br class=cll><p>
Great for separating meat from bone with a minimum of effort and a 
minimum of waste, but of little use to the vegetarian. It looks superficially 
like the filleting knife but is thicker and much more rigid. The 
<a href="kn_bonez.html"><b>Boning Knife</b></a> must be razor sharp to 
be of much use. Stone it early and often.</p>
<p>While you use this knife, keep it from hitting bone as much as you can, 
but you probably can't avoid it entirely and still minimize waste. Just 
be prepared to sharpen it as needed.</p>
