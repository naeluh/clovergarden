<p>The Chef's knife is the basic prep knife in most kitchens. The most 
common length is 8 inches, but 7 inches would be fine in my opinion.  
I don't use a chef's knife because I like my 
<a href="kn_debaz.html">Mioroshi Deba</a> so much.</p>

<p>Chef's knives are available in an absurd range of prices, from about 
US $8.00 to over $800.00. If I were in the market for one I'd look mostly 
in the $30 to $60 range where quality should be quite good and the price still 
reasonable. I might consider something around $100 if I liked it a lot. 
Chef's knives are also now available in an absurd range of shapes, some 
quite outlandish.</p>

<p>The knife in the photo is the classic shape for a Chef's Knife. The cutting 
edge is 9-1/2 inches, which I consider a little too long for household 
use and would select one 7 to 8 inches long. The total length of this knife 
14-1/2 inches. The back edge is 0.15 inches thick at the handle end 
tapering steadily to 0.03 inches at the tip. This knife has a fully 
forged blade.</p>

<p>The photo specimen is one of the last carbon steel chef's knives 
made by Sabatier before going to all stainless. They sold all the left-over 
blade blanks for scrap, to an outfit that finished them up and sold them as 
finished knives under their own name - so successfully that Sabatier recently 
started making a series of classic carbon steel knives again. </p>
