<h1>Deba Knives</h1>

<p>Debas are perhaps the most common knives in Japanese kitchens, and 
for good reason. The only real problem with them is left handers may have 
a difficult time finding a left handed version.</p>

<h2>Mioroshi Deba</h2>

<br><img src="img/kn_debam01b.jpg" alt="Mioroshi Deba" class=mrg>
<br class=cll><p>
This is my general prep knife, the knife I use 10 times more than all the 
other knives I have put together. I cannot imagine a better knife, except 
one of these about an inch longer (most of them are). It is thicker and  
sturdier than a <a href="kn_chefz.html"><b>Chef's Knife</b></a> but at 
least as sharp. The Mioroshi is longer, thinner, lower in profile and 
more gently curved than the regular Deba, which is more a meat cutting 
knife. As with other Debas, this knife is beveled on one side and flat 
on the other. Left handed versions are available but may be hard to find.
</p>
<p>This particular knife has been in daily use for around 50 years, and 
has been razor sharp every day of its life, and has never seen a knife 
sharpener (I don't even own one). As you can see from the photo, it is 
made from 440A stainless, the first really knife grade alloy. It has 
since been replaced by other grades, but they aren't a lot different 
from 440A. The cutting edge is 6-1/2 inches and the back edge of the 
knife is 0.15 inch thick (3.8 mm). Total length is 11-7/8 inches. The 
blade tang had to be reseated in the handle year ago, for which Gorilla 
Glue is the ideal adhesive.</p>
<p>I have no idea how much I paid (it was on sale at a department store) 
or how that would translate to 2020 dollars, but similar knives are 
currently available from about US $80.00 on up to a few hundred.</p>

<p>The wide back edge makes it possible to press down on the back of the 
blade without hurting yourself, and it's sharp corners are also useful in 
many ways, but particularly for scaling fish.</p>
<p>The weight and rigidity of the blade also has advantages, particularly 
for crushing garlic cloves flat with the side of the knife before slicing 
and chopping them, for whacking nuts to crack them, for pitting natural 
cure green olives, and again for scaling fish. The pointed tip is 
sufficiently pointy for most work and the shortness and rigidity of the 
blade compared to a typical chef's knife makes it much easier to work 
with the tip.

<h2>Deba (Standard)</h2>
<br><img src="img/kn_debas01.jpg" alt="Deba" class=mrg>
<br class=cll><p>
The standard Deba is more a meat cutting and boning knife than a general 
prep knife. Compared to the Mioroshi it is shorter, thicker, heavier and 
higher in profile. It is heavy enough and sturdy enough to chop through small 
bones.
