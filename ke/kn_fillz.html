<br class=cll><p>
Designed for disassembling fish, this thin flexible knife with a razor 
edge is excellent for that task, but pretty useless for anything else. 
The Filleting Knife <u>must</u> be accompanied by a stone because its 
delicate edge needs to be resharpened often, usually before 
the next fish.</p>

<p>The photo specimen, with a 6-1/8 inch blade (about the shortest you 
would want) is a very popular knife made in Finland by J. Marttiini and 
comes with a leather belt scabbard. This knife has been made for over 
80 years and is available at prices from US $18.00 to $25.00.</p>
