Particularly useful for field trips and parties, this folding tool is 
light weight and practical.

<p>This model features a very sharp cork screw, and two fulcrum points 
for particularly difficult corks. The knife blade is short, but sufficient 
for cutting wine bottle capsules, and what else would you need a knife 
blade for? It also has a hook for popping beer bottle caps, and even 
a tab at the end of the fulcrums for prying up pull tabs on cans.</p>
<p>This model was purchased from a large Asian market in Los Angeles 
(San Gabriel) for 2020 US $2.89.
