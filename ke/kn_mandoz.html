<h1>Mandolin</h1>

This is a very flexible device and a tremendous help when you need to cut or 
slice a lot of vegetables. Shown in the photo is the Oxo 1054752. Not only 
does this device slice to any thickness you wish to set (up to about 3/8 inch) 
but it will also julienne, cut fries, and do ripple cuts as well 
as straight cuts.

<p>Keep one thing in mind - the Mandolin 
is a <b>very dangerous device</b> which should be used only by consenting 
adults who are not currently impaired by drugs or alcohol, or working 
under distraction, and kept completely away from children and teens. 
Accidents with a mandolin don't just cut, they commonly take a chunk of 
flesh and heal slowly.</p>

<p>All mandolins come with a safety slider (the hat shaped item lower left 
in the photo). It can't always be used, but it can be very helpful with 
wider things like potatoes. I's a bit clumsy at first but you need to get 
used to it to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>I confess, the slider is just about impossible when slicing something 
like a Persian cucumber (my main use for the Mandolin). For things like 
that I slow way down when nearing the blade, and do the last few slices with 
a vegetable slicing knife.</p>

<p>Note that to slice tomatoes you need a "V blade" or "angled blade" 
slicer, not a straight blade like the model in the photo. I always us 
a knife for tomatoes so the straight blade works fine for me. Oxo also 
makes a V blade slicer (1155700V3) for around 2020 US $40. Oxo has 
replace he straight blade slicer (photo) with an angle blade slicer 
(11194500) for around 2020 US $80, about the same cost as the straigh 
blade in the photo.</p>

<p>Another very popular V blade mandolin is the Swissmar Borner, priced 
similarly to the Oxo V blade (US $35 to $40). It is a bit limited with 
just a few pre-set thicknesses available. It is said to have the easiest 
to use safety slider.
</p>

<p>The Oxo I use has been criticized for the blade not being sharp enough, 
but it is easily removed and sharpened. Some mandolins have blades that 
cannot be sharpened or can be sharpened only with difficulty. This is 
something to look for when selecting a model.</p>

<p>One feature I very much like is the sturdiness and stability of the 
Oxos. I understand the Borner has no back feet so it needs to be held up 
with one hand while being operated with the other. This seems to me 
rather clumsy.</p>
