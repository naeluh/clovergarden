<p>The "Y" shaped peeler is easier to use and less fatiguing than the 
paring knife shape peeler. I very much like the Titan set of peeler and 
julienning peeler. The set got bad reviews over price when sold by late 
night TV, but the price at Bed Bath and Beyond is quite acceptable. The 
peeler was criticized for sometimes needing two strokes over an area 
because it peeled so thin. This is exactly what I want, because much of 
the nutrition of root vegetables is right under the skin.</p>

<p>My first Julienning Peeler was an Oxo. It was very frustrating as 
the blades were not long enough to fully separate the strands. This is 
not at all a problem with the Titan peeler.</p>
