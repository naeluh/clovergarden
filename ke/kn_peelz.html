This is why I don't own a paring knife. A swivel peeler peels much more 
easily, evenly and waaaaay faster. For any actual cutting my utility 
knife does just fine.
<p>Of the two forms shown, I very greatly prefer the Y shaped draw 
knife form. It is much less fatiguing and more natural to hold than the 
traditional knife form. Most manufacturers now make both forms.
<p>The photo specimen is "Titan" brand. This is by far the best peeler 
I've ever owned, but this brand got a horrible review in Popular 
Mechanics, based entirely price. They used a "late night TV show" 
price with shipping, and I agree it was high. I bought mine at BB&amp;B 
(Bed Bath and Beyond) paired with the Julienne peeler (see below). The 
pair cost me US $14, and I consider that a bargain, given the quality.

This device is very similar to a regular swivel peeler, except it has a 
row if vertical blades just behind the cutting blade which cut the "peel" 
into thin strips. This can be a fabulous time saver. You can use the thin 
strips as is or cut them crosswise for a very even chopped effect.
<p>Use a regular swivel peeler to take off the skin. Then use the 
julienne peeler to shave the item down to nothing but shreds.</p>
<p>The photo specimen is "Titan" brand (see above for details). I also 
own an Oxo, a totally frustrating device of which Oxo should be 
thoroughly ashamed - it doesn't cut all the way through, so the strands 
don't separate. You have to pull each one from the others by hand. Yes, 
I checked that all the teeth were properly aligned. I also don't know 
what moron at Oxo thinks black is a proper color for kitchen equipment, 
but I see most of their stuff only in black these days.</p>
