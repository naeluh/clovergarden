I've never been to chef school, so why do I think I can tell you more 
about sharpening kitchen knives than culinary experts can, and sometimes 
even go against their advice?</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>I've worked many years in tool rooms, with cutting and grinding devices 
of all kinds, and with metals both plain and exotic. I probably know more 
about working with metals than any chef alive. I'm also clearly a lot less 
tolerant of dullness than most writers suggest you should be. </span>

<h2 id="gen">General</h2>

<p>Dull knives are frustrating, damage the food you are cutting, and are 
dangerous. A dull knife may skid unexpectedly and still be sharp enough 
to cut into you. If a knife is dull enough to "need to be sent out for 
sharpening" it has been too dull to use for quite a while. There is no 
excuse for dull knives.</p>

<p>The pros have been afraid to tell you the truth - and the truth is 
this: you need to learn to sharpen your own knives, and you need to learn 
to do it with stones, and you need to do it early and often - and it 
isn't hard to do. If you can learn to slice thin, you can learn to 
sharpen knives.</p>

<p><a href="kn_debaz.html">
<img src="img/kn_debam01f.jpg" alt="Deba Knife" class=mrg></a>
As "Exhibit A" I present my Mioroshi Deba. It has been used almost every 
single day for about 40 years, and every one of those days it's been wicked 
sharp. At its worst it would still do well with the "newspaper test". It has 
never seen a knife sharpener (I don't own one), nor has it touched a 
sharpening steel. Notice that for 40 years of use it shows rather little 
wear.</p>

<p>Maintaining a knife like this is not difficult, and it's not tedious - 
unless you have been negligant and let your knife get very dull. A prep 
knife needs to be sharpened once or twice a week, depending on how much 
you use it. A filleting knife may need to be sharpened after every fish, 
and a boning knife should be sharpened after every use. If you cannot make 
it totally sharp in just a few minutes, you have been trying to cut with a 
very dull knife.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="test">Sharpness Tests and Inspection</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>The Newspaper Test</h3>
<br><img src="img/kn_sharp05k.jpg" alt="Newspaper cut" class=mrg>
The real test of sharpness is, of course, how the knife feels in actual 
use. You might, however, want to check it while sharpening, and this is 
an imperfect but reasonable test.

<p>Dry the knife blade completely. Take a half page of newspaper, and 
fold it over. Crease it only where you'll be holding it. Starting with 
the handle end of the blade just in front of your fingers draw the knife 
across the paper at moderate speed in a single smooth stroke as you slice 
downward. Use very light downward pressure. As in the photo, the blade 
should cut, not tear the paper.</p>

<p>How far you get before the paper starts to tear is a reasonable 
measure of sharpness. Ideally, a long knife should cut right off the 
edge and a short knife should cut until the tip clears.
<br class=cll><p></p></li>

<li><h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
<br>With a strong light above, hold the knife so the sharp edge points 
directly  towards the light. Looking directly down at the edge, and moving 
the edge about just a little, it should be entirely invisible. If there 
are any glints of light from it, it is nicked or dull.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Finger Inspection</h3>
<br>Hold the knife by it's handle in one hand. With the other hand, 
place your thumb on one side of the blade, your forefinger opposite it 
and draw your fingers slowly straight off the edge. If you feel any burr 
at the edge on either side the knife is plenty dull. Check this at 
various points on the blade. You can feel burrs that are too small to 
see.
<p>You can also perform this test by running a fingernail off the edge 
and see if it catches on a burr. This test is very effective to see if 
you've stoned all the way to the edge when reshaping blade angles.</p>

<p>Another "finger test" is to lightly rub your thumb across the edge. 
You can get a pretty good feel for sharpness. That's crosswise - not 
lengthwise, or there'll be blood everywhere!</p></li>

</ul>
<br>


<h2 id="need">What you Need &amp; Don't Need</h2>
<p></p>
<h3 id="stone">You Need Stones</h3>

<p><a href="kn_stone.html">
<img src="img/kn_stones05e.jpg" alt="Stones" class=mrg></a>
You need two sharpening stones, one medium and one fine, and your cutting 
board. If you really abuse your knives or wait way too long to sharpen them 
you might need a coarse stone.</p>
<p>Types of stone and terminology are complex 
and confusing, so rather than clog up this page with all the details I have 
made a separate page for <a href="kn_stone.html"><b>Sharpening Stones</b>
</a>.</p>
<p>Both man-made and natural (Arkansas) stones will work fine, but man-made 
stones cut faster and natural stones aren't as good with stainless as 
they are with carbon steel. Some stones have a medium and fine side, 
but in most cases they are not ideally matched for kitchen use. The size 
you want is 2 inches by 6 inches by 3/4 inch or larger. Can't afford stones? 
There's a way around that on my Sharpening Stones page too.</p>

<p>Lubrication will help keep stones cutting well and prevents them from 
becoming clogged with metal. The lubrication you want to use in the 
kitchen is running water. Oil is not only messy but the stone will not cut 
as fast. Experts have found that oil produces an inferior edge because it 
holds grit from the stone causing microscopic chips in the edge. 
Sportsmen use oil because water may not be available. I occasionally 
scrub my stones with a scouring kitchen cleanser (similar to Comet) to 
clear the pores and keep them cutting well.

<p><b>What stones would I choose?</b> &nbsp; I like a fine India stone 
used with water for aggressive edge shaping, but at 280 grit it's too 
coarse for a finished edge. I like something around 700 grit for the 
finish edge, a fast cutting diamond or water stone (I use a diamond 
stone). 
<br class=cll></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Medium Stone:</b> &nbsp; This is your workhorse stone for preparing 
a new knife or for re-edging your knives if they have become unpleasantly 
dull.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Fine Stone:</b> &nbsp; This stone will be used to finish the edge 
after using the medium stone. It is also the stone you will do a few 
strokes on instead of a sharpening steel every time your knife starts to 
feel just a little off its best.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Superfine Stone:</b> &nbsp; Hard Arkansas and the like are great 
for woodworking tools, but just a bit too fine for the kitchen.<p></p>
</li>

<li><b>Coarse Stone:</b> &nbsp; Good for sharpening axes. Useful for 
working out nicks and dents in a badly abused blade. Hopefully you won't 
need one of these.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="var">Controversial</h3>

<ul>
<li id="steel"><b>Sharpening Steel:</b>
<br><img src="img/kn_steel01e.jpg" alt="Sharpening Steel" class=mrg>
The traditional steel is useful for realigning the edges of carbon steel 
knives. Contrary to what you may have read, the steel, in its traditional 
form, is not a "hone". A hone is a very fine stone that removes metal. 
The steel does not remove a significant amount of metal from the blade.
<p>The job of the steel is to return an edge that has become bent to the 
side to a straight centered position. It does this through very high 
pressure, resulting from the tiny point of contact between the knife edge 
and the steel. It works best on soft blades, and I suspect people's 
insistence on using the steel is why most Euro-Amercian makers tend to 
make their knife blades a bit on the soft side.</p>
<p>For modern hard carbon steel blades some knife experts consider the 
serrated steels you'll commonly find in the stores ineffective and 
recommend a smooth steel. For stainless knives the effectiveness of 
either type of steel is subject to considerable doubt.</p>
<p>Because knife users have perceived traditional steels ineffective 
with today's knives, many have switched to ceramic or diamond grit steels. 
These <u>are</u> hones and do remove material from the blade edge.</p>
<p>My question is simple. If you're going to be using a hone, why not 
use a more effective hone, your fine sharpening stone? In my opinion a 
steel is of little use today, unless you are making heavy use of 
traditional carbon steel knives. The strokes for honing the edge are 
exactly the same as sharpening (see below) but just a few strokes on the 
fine stone.</p> 
<p>If you do use a steel, there is controversy there too. Some still use 
it in the air, as in the photo above, which makes a good show. Others put 
it point down on the cutting board like a giant nail, which gives better 
control. Some stroke the knife sharp edge leading (most) and others sharp 
edge trailing. Even the recommended angle of knife to steel 
differs, though I'd agree with the 22&deg; opinion (for knives edged at 
22&deg; and reject steeper angles). All agree the stroke should be 
simultaneously across and along the rod, and most agree that 10 strokes 
on each side is about right.

</small><br class=cll>
</li> 
<li id="sys"><b>Sharpening "Systems"</b>
<br><img src="img/kn_lansky01k.jpg" alt="Lansky System" class=mrg>
There are many 
"sharpening systems" on the market. Most of these contraptions are aimed at 
holding the knife blade at a consistent and measured angle to the stone. I 
haven't time for these. When my knife doesn't feel right I want to just grab 
a fine stone and take a few strokes and get back to cutting. Setting up and 
taking down a "system" just takes too much time and will discourage me from 
sharpening my knives often enough.
<p>Perhaps the back angle will be a little rounded at the shoulders when 
sharpening free-hand? Well, it happens that a convex edge is considered 
one of the better edge forms, offering good durability. Provided the 
back angle is nicely formed and the edge angle is properly sharp, a little 
rounding isn't a problem. A lot of rounding is a problem though, so do your 
best to hold a correct and constant angle.</p>
<p>If you are simply not confident you can hold angles well, the Lansky 
sharpening system (photo) is well thought of, reasonably priced and 
relatively quick to set up and take down. It comes in both diamond and 
regular stone versions. &nbsp; <small>Photo &copy;

<h3 id="bad">Not Needed</h3>

<ul>
<li id="elect"><b>Electric Knife Sharpener:</b> &nbsp; One thing 
you learn from comparative reviews is that most of these don't work all that 
well. Most motorized sharpeners remove too much metal too fast and will wear 
out your knives long before their time. Angles are often restricted so you may 
not be able to use the ideal angle for the type of knife you are sharpening. 
A knife should never be allowed to get so dull it needs an aggressive  knife 
sharpener. If you get a bad ding in the edge of a knife you can send it 
out for professional sharpening, but theoretically that should never happen.
<p>If you do want an electric knife sharpener (commercial kitchens have them 
to save time and reduce training costs) the Chef's Choice line is the 
run-away favorite. The 2000 model for larger commercial kitchens can be 
had for around $430. There are many other models for smaller kitchens going 
down to about $60, with declining capability at each drop in cost. Most 
who comment like the ones around US $100 or a little more.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="tech">How to Sharpen</h2>

<p>If you can learn to slice vegetables thin, you can learn to sharpen 
knives. The first thing you need to do is get a feel for sharpening 
angles. This will improve with practice.</p>

<p>A thin vegetable slicing knife (Santoku or Nakiri) should be sharpened 
at a shallower angle (sharper) than a general prep knife, and so should a 
filleting knife. A meat cleaver should be sharpened at a much higher angle 
than a prep knife for a very strong edge.</p>

<h3>Back Angle <small>&amp;</small> Edge Angle</h3>

<p>The angles at the cutting edge are critical. The standard for 
commercial knives is a wide back angle of about 18&deg; and a narrow 
(less than 1/32 inch) edge angle of 22-1/2&deg;. This results in a very 
steep angle of 45&deg; at the cutting edge, certainly less than ideal, 
but used by commercial knife makers to make a durable edge for those 
who never sharpen their knives (most people). Knife sharpening services 
will maintain these angles for the same reason.</p>

<p>Note that Japanese knives angled on one side only (chisel edge) have 
an angle of about 25&deg;. This results in an edge much sharper than the 
45&deg; edge of a conventional knife angled at 22-1/2&deg; per side. 
Japanese knife makers also make their knives a bit harder to support this 
sharp edge.<p>

<p>Personally, since I sharpen my knives early and often, I like a 
shallower angle and grind a back angle right out to the edge. This may 
take a bit of effort with a new knife, but is easy to maintain once done. 
Then I use a few strokes at a slightly steeper angle to create an 
extremely narrow edge angle.

<br><img src="img/kn_angle01l.jpg" alt="Angle" class=mrg>
<br class=cll></p>


<h3>Method</h3>


<p>While the same stones and general methods work for both carbon steel 
and stainless steel, there is considerable difference between the two.
<ul>
<li><b>Carbon Steel</b> is hard and brittle. It sharpens quickly and 
  easily to an edge that is actually composed of microscopic teeth. 
  This gives it a very satisfying cutting feel.</li>
<li><b>Stainless Steel</b> is a little softer and a whole lot tougher. 
  It takes more strokes on the stone to sharpen and the edge will be 
  smoother and a lot less toothy. It will never have the feel of a 
  carbon steel knife no matter how sharp. The biggest problem is that 
  during sharpening it will build up a feather edge that just bends 
  back and forth as you sharpen from both sides. This must be 
  deliberately broken off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the condition of your knife and its typical use you will 
usually start with your medium stone and then finish with the fine stone. 
If the knife is still quite sharp you may go directly to the fine stone, 
as I do with my Santoko.</p>

<p>Generally you will hold the stone in one hand and the knife by its 
handle in the other hand. If you are unsure you can do this safely or 
accurately, you can place the stone on a folded up wet towel on your 
cutting board, but I find this awkward.</p>

<p>
<img src="img/kn_sharp01e.jpg" alt="Start stroke" class=mrg>
<img src="img/kn_sharp02e.jpg" alt="End stroke" class=mrg>
<br class=cll></p><p>
<img src="img/kn_sharp03c.jpg" alt="Start stroke" class=mrg>
<img src="img/kn_sharp04k.jpg" alt="End stroke" class=mrg></p>

<p>The upper photos show stroking one side of the knife across the stone, 
first at the start of the stroke, then at the end of the stroke. The lower 
pictures show the same for the other side.</p>
<p>After a number of strokes across the stone on both sides, rinse the blade and <b>make a 
firm cutting stroke across your cutting board</b>. Make sure the full length 
of the edge contacts the board at some point during the stroke. What this 
does is break off the feather of a stainless steel edge, or at least weaken 
it and bend it over so far it'll be taken off by a couple more light strokes 
on the stone. For a carbon steel knife it will break off teeth that are too 
long and fragile.</p>
<p>Repeat as needed, always making a few light strokes on the stone after 
the cutting board slice, until the knife easily passes the newspaper test - 
or simpler, just feels right when cutting.</p>
<p>Note that every article you'll see tells you to stroke leading with the 
sharp edge - but I stroke with the sharp edge trailing. I'm 
very uncomfortable with leading with the sharp edge. Does anyone at all 
agree with me? Only the Japanese - but I've heard they know a thing or two 
about knives.</p>
