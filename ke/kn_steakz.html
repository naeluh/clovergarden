<p>This is a great place to waste money. Yes, if you serve large hunks 
of meat on a plate, each person needs a steak knife. You can get a nice 
set of six Wusthof Classic steak knives for only 2020 US $528 (that's 
list, don't pay more than $350 on the Intenet - what a bargain!). Of 
course they'll be dull where they touch the plate in no time. 
That's why most steak knives are serrated, so only the peaks touch the 
plate and get dull. Unfortunately, serrated knives don't cut, they shred 
and tear - quite unpleasant and considered bad form.</p>
<p>I buy my non-serrated Steak Knives at a local Asian market for $1.39 
each. They work just fine and it takes only a moment to stone the tips 
sharp enough to cut after use (only 1/2 inch or so up near the tip ever 
touches the plate and gets dull). You just don't need a super-knife for 
this application.</p>
