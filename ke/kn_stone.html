<h1>Sharpening Stones</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg> Both man-made and natural stones (Arkansas) work fine, 
but man-made stones cut faster. Some stones are categorized as "oil 
stones". Oil stones work just fine with water, but, for kitchen use, 
stones should never be oiled.</span>

<p><span class=bg>In the kitchen environment running water is the 
lubricant to use. Researchers have found oil, aside from being messy 
and inconvenient, produces an inferior edge, because grits dislodged 
from the stone are held by the oil and cause chips in the knife edge.

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; Grit Sizes</h2>

<p>Unfortunately grit rating systems are not always uniform from one sort of 
abrasive to another or one grading system to another. This chart is not 100% 
accurate, but far more accurate than you'd be able to detect.</p>
<p>Japanese "Waterstones" are usable to finer grits than other stones 
because they wear away, presenting fresh sharp grit that cuts fast.
<br>Diamond stones also cut fast but without wearing away.</p>
<p>Grit sizes are average for a range of sizes which may be different for 
each manufacturer.</p>

<h2 id="var">Varieties of Stones</h2>

<h3 id="nat">Natural Stones</h3>

<p><img src="img/kn_stoneah02e.jpg" alt="Bench Stone" class=mrg>
Natural stones are quarried from deposits of a mineral called novaculite. 
The most available are called Arkansas Stones, and come in soft and 
hard grades, but Washita (coarser than soft Arkansas) and Queer Creek Blue 
(variable, but around hard white Arkansas) are also available. 
Novaculite has a mohs hardness of 6.5, equivalent to Rockwell Rc 69. 
Most knife blades are around 5.5 (Rc 59).</p>
<p>In the past these stones were highly thought of for sharpening kitchen 
knives, but they have fallen out of favor because they have a harder time 
with stainless steel. They are considered "oil stones" but work just fine 
with water. Note that the best deposits have been quarried out, so some 
"Arkansas" stones are reconstituted from grit.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hard Arkansas</b> is a very fine stone much liked by wood carvers 
  and other craftsmen working in wood, but is really too fine to be practical 
  for use with kitchen knives. Hard Translucent Arkansas is the top of the 
  line and quite expensive.</li>
<li><b>Soft Arkansas</b> is a "medium" stone, cutting fairly quickly and 
  producing a very sharp edge, but not the polished edge hard Arkansas 
  produces. Soft Arkansas is suitable for sharpening carbon steel kitchen 
  knives.</li>
<li><b>Combination Kits</b> Some sharpening kits include both soft and 
  hard Arkansas along with a man-made coarse stone. Blocks of soft and 
  hard Arkansas bonded back to back are also widely available.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="india">Aluminum Oxide - India Stones</h3>

<p><img src="img/kn_stoneind02e.jpg" alt="India Stones" class=mrg>
"India Stone" is a trademark of Norton Abrasives for man-made stones 
of Aluminum Oxide that are vitreously bonded. In other words, they are 
heated to such a high temperature that the grains fuse together. 
Other companies can make similar stones but cannot call them "India". 
Aluminum oxide has a mohs hardness of 9.2. The photo specimens are 2 inch x 
8 inch stones. The top one is fine on the top side, coarse on the bottom, 
and the bottom stone is medium. </p>
<p>Aluminum Oxide stones range from 150 grit to 280 grit and cut aggressively 
but not quite so much as Silicon Carbide. The medium (240 grit) would be 
considered "coarse" for sharpening kitchen knives, and the fine would be 
considered "medium". They are considered an "oil stone" but work just fine 
with water, Unfortunately Norton's stones come pre-oiled so I'd scrub it 
well with a strong kitchen cleanser before each use until the oil is 
mostly gone.</p>

<h3 id="cryst">Silicon Carbide - Crystolon</h3>

<p><img src="img/kn_stonesc01h.jpg" alt="Stone" class=mrg>
"Crystolon" is a trademark of Norton Abrasives for man-made stones 
of Silicon Carbide that are vitreously bonded. In other words, they are 
heated to such a high temperature that the grains fuse together. 
Other companies can make similar stones but cannot call them "Crystolon". 
Silicon Carbide has a mohs hardness of 9.5.</p>
<p>Silicon Carbide stones are blue-gray in color and are in the coarser 
range, from 100 grit to 240 grit. Fine Crystolon is adequate for finish 
sharpening kitchen knives, but too coarse to be ideal. Silicon carbide 
stones are considered "oil stones" but work just fine with water.</p>

<h3 id="h2o">Waterstones</h3>

<p>
<img src="img/kn_stonew01e.jpg" alt="Waterstone" class=mrg>
Water stones are noted for cutting very fast, but at a cost. The stone 
itself wears fairly fast and needs to be straightened with a straightening 
stone now and then, This holds for both natural and man-made water stones, 
whether Japanese or American, and is by design. American stones tend to 
stay flat longer but still cut as well as the Japanese. &nbsp; 
<small>Photo &copy; Norton</small></p>

<p>The archetype water stone is the Japanese natural stone, but the natural 
stone has been pretty much mined out, so most are made from abrasive grit 
bonded with natural clay, resin, or fired like an India stone but less 
firmly. Coarser stones are often made from silicon carbide and finer stones 
from aluminum oxide.</p>
<p>Water stones should be soaked in water for about 15 minutes before 
using.</p>

<p>Waterstones are generally listed by a grit fineness rating that does  
not correspond with ratings for other types of stone.
<ul>
<li><b>220:</b> &nbsp; A very coarse stone for rapid removal of material 
  from badly dulled or damaged blades.</li>
<li><b>1000:</b> &nbsp; A medium stone very useful for sharpening kitchen 
  knives.
<li><b>4000:</b> &nbsp; A fine stone, about the finest you'd want for 
  finishing kitchen blades.</li>
<li><b>8000:</b> &nbsp; A very fine stone producing a mirror finish. Rather 
too fine for culinary use but popular for wood cutting tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>Norton makes a combination 1000 / 4000 stone which is very good for 
kitchen sharpening, if you want to go with water stones. Remember, when 
ordering water stones, be sure to also order a flattening 
stone (actually, some use a sheet of similar grit silicon carbide 
sandpaper on a flat surface).<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="diam">Diamond Stones</h3>

<p><img src="img/kn_stonedf01e.jpg" alt="Diamond Stone" class=mrg>
These "stones" are actually made of metal with a surface of embedded 
man-made diamond grit. They stay very flat, are long lasting, cut fast 
and are used with water as a lubricant. They can be used to flatten other 
stones and can be used to sharpen ceramic knives which have a mohs hardness 
of 8.5. Diamond has a mohs hardness of 10. The photo specimen is the fine 
(700 grit) stone I use to finish an edge, and instead of a steel for 
dressing the edge during use.</p>
<p>Diamond stones come in a full range of grits from very course to 
extra fine. They come in two varieties, with a patterned surface and a 
continuous surface. The patterned is fine for knives but the continuous 
surface stones are recommended for small pointed tools like drill bits.</p>
<p>Pricing of diamond stones has become fairly reasonable as man-made diamonds 
become cheaper and cheaper (gem quality man-made diamonds are also becoming 
very cheap) but there is still a significant premium for diamond stones. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="alt">A Cheaper Alternative</h2>

<p>Get some smooth wooden blocks and glue to them (using a very thin glue 
so there are no lumps) "Wet or Dry" sandpaper from the local hardware 
store. The grit sizes listed on them are the CAMI sizes, so use the chart 
at the top of this page as a guide. "Wet or Dry" sandpaper is made from 
silicon carbide abrasive grit resin bonded to the backing.</p>
<p>Some woodworking craftsmen use whole sheets of Wet or Dry stuck down 
to plates of glass and claim it gives them a better edge than stones, and 
with a better grit selection. Wet or Dry is available from 60 grit down 
to 2000 grit, but many hardware stores don't carry anything finer than 600 
grit.</p>
