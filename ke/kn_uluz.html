Superficially similar to the 
<a href="kn_mezzaz.html"><b>Mezzaluna</b></a>, but differing greatly 
in scope of use, this knife is very popular in Alaska. It is used for 
general slicing, chopping, boning meat, scraping hides and many other 
tasks.
<p>The photo specimen is an example of a native Alaskan Ulu, hand made, 
probably from an old sawmill blade. It has seen at least 50 years of 
service.</p>
<p>Fancier versions can be ordered from various sources in Alaska, and 
from some knife vendors. These vendors also sell a concave chopping block 
to go with them - but I have it on very expert authority this is not 
authentic - they're aimed at the tourist market. In their natural 
environment these knives are used against either a flat slab of wood or 
against a hide, depending on what is being cut. &nbsp;
