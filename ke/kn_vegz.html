<h1>Vegetable Slicing Knife</h1>

<p>Sometimes you need much more precise slicing control than you get from 
a Chef's knife or Deba.  The basic requirements are a relatively short, 
wide, very thin blade with a razor edge. Here are two excellent vegetable 
slicing knives, but both are of little use for anything else.</p>


<h2>Santoku</h2>
<br><img src="img/kn_santo01b.jpg" alt="Santoku" class=mrg>
<br class=cll><p>
More utter crap has been written about the Santoku than just about any 
other knife. Some years back, it was being widely heralded as the best 
of all knives, and the only knife you really needed in your kitchen. In 
2009, at least one celebrity chef was still claiming the Santoku was 
the only knife he used - and I'm pretty sure he was being paid off by 
Wusthof. Evidence: he frequently gave away Wusthof Santokus, which 
were rather expensive, if you had to pay for them. this was before 
competition forced them to come out with a mid-priced line.</p>

<p>The much more economical Santoku in the photo served me very well 
for more than a decade. I retired it because wear to my cutting board 
required a Santoku with just a little more curve on the cutting edge. 
The "Grantons" (hollows) along the edge are intended to keep slices 
from sticking to the blade, making cutting smoother and easier. They 
sort of work, but slices still stick. The grantons are not a Japanese 
feature, but a European addition. Most Santokus sold in North America 
sport the European form handle. The photo specimen is fairly typical 
(Santokus now come in some pretty strange sizes). It's a 7 inch 
Cuisinart, with a cutting edge 6-1/2 inches long. The back edge of 
the blade is 0.07 inch (1.8mm) thick with a total length of 11-3/4 
inches. It cost less than 2009 US $20 at BB&B.</p>

<p>My current Santoku (2020) is an admittedly expensive (though bought 
on sale) Shun Classic with damascus blade. The expensive damascus feature 
is <u>entirely decorative</u> and <u>serves no other purpose</u>. It's 
the very hard, narrow angle, non-damascus core that provides its cutting 
prowess. It must be stoned (I use a fine diamond hone). A knife sharpener 
would ruin this blade. I prefer Japanese knives because their cutting 
edges are generally much harder than Euro-American knives.</p> 

<p>Why is the Santoku of little use as a general purpose prep knife? For 
one thing the back edge of the blade is way too thin. You can't press 
down on it without hurting yourself. The point is way too blunt for much 
prep work and the sides too flat. It slices very straight - because it is 
otherwise nearly impossible to maneuver. Trying to cut the core out of 
half an apple with a Santoku is an exercise in hilarity. It is too light 
and unstable for chopping. It is also too flimsy for tasks such as 
crushing garlic or whacking nuts with the side of the blade.</p>

<p>Many Santokus are waaaaaay out of balance, including the one in the 
photo. The blade is so light compared to the handle that if you place it 
near the edge of your cutting board (as you always do with your regular 
prep knife), it'll do a back flip off the board and head straight for 
your foot, point first. A light Japanese style wooden handle would really 
help here.</p>

<h2>Nakiri</h2>
<br><img src="img/kn_nakiri02b.jpg" alt="Nakiri" class=mrg>
<br class=cll><p>
This knife is still much used in Japan, in various sizes and thicknesses, 
but in North America it has been eclipsed by the Santoku due to heavy 
promotion by manufacturers. In theory it is very similar, short, wide, 
very thin, razor sharp, but is even more limited by having no point at 
all. This one, purchased about 50 years ago in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, 
has a European form handle. The cutting edge is 6 inches long and the 
back edge of the blade is 0.7 inch (1.8mm) thick. Total knife length 
is 11-1/4 inches.</p>

<p>This knife is <u>always</u> on the bread board at my parties, because 
it is <u>much better</u> at slicing breads than the serrated bread 
knife. So much better guests have asked where they could get one.</p>
