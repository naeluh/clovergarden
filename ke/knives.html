If you select knives carefully and intelligently, and maintain them 
properly, you need buy them only once in your lifetime.  You should 
select excellent quality, but perfectly fine knives can be had at a 
fraction of the "famous name" costs you see in the gourmet catalogs.

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; History</h2>

<p><img src="img/ke_knifeflint01k.jpg" alt="Flint Knife" class=mrg>
The first manufactured knives were made of flint and similar 
stone, "napped" to a thin sharp edge. Suitable flint became an important 
article of trade, and some 30,000 years ago men learned how to roast the 
stone in hot fires so it would flake better.  Flint knives were still used 
in Ancient Egypt for thousands of years after metal knives became available. 
</p>
<p>Some years ago scientists wondered if early man could actually 
dismantle a wooly mammoth with the stone knives available to them. Testing 
was easy because flint knives are still made by napping hobbyists and 
American Indian artisans. Applied to a large beast they proved surprisingly 
efficient, cutting well and keeping a sharp edge - if they chipped on 
bone they chipped sharp.</p>
<p>Flint was followed by bronze, then iron and finally steel, which is 
actually just very pure iron with precisely controlled contaminants. Today 
bronze tools are used only in explosive environments where sparks must be 
avoided.

<br class=cll></p>


<h3 id="qual">Quality &amp; Cost</h3>

<p><img src="img/kn_saw01c.jpg" alt="Saw blade" class=mrg>
A knife cut from an old saw blade salvaged from a lumber mill, if well 
designed, carefully made and properly maintained, will serve pretty much the 
same as a US $450 knife made of exotic metals by a famous maker in Japan and 
endorsed by a celebrity chef. Standard materials of good quality serve pretty 
much the same as fancy damasked steel a la Samurai sword. Design, 
durability, <u>suitability for purpose</u> and the practiced <u>skills of 
the user</u> (including sharpening skills) make the real difference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, really cheap knives and sets advertised on late night 
TV will likely fail to please. I'm not saying cost is not at all an 
indicator of quality, I'm saying that, after a point, there's a very 
steep curve of diminishing returns. Of course, if your main objective is 
to show off, then go for the top!
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0016</a>.</small>
<br class=cll></p>


<h3 id="mat">Materials</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Carbon Steel:</b> &nbsp; For the last couple thousand years, this 
  is what knives were made of. Making a proper carbon steel knife requires 
  skill and good equipment. The right alloy must be selected. The grain of 
  the metal is stretched and aligned by rolling or forging. It is then hardened 
  by heating to a precise temperature and quenching (chilling) at just the 
  right rate. It will then be very hard but very brittle, so the temper 
  is drawn at a very specific moderate temperature for an exact amount 
  of time, making the blade softer but stronger. Differential tempering can 
  be done so the edge is very hard and the back is tougher. Finally the 
  blade is ground and polished to its finished form.<p>
  <p>Good carbon steel knives have a very sharp feel (when properly sharpened) 
  and they sharpen easily. The edge can be refreshed with a "sharpening steel" 
  between real sharpenings.  On the negative side, they rust instantly if 
  not properly cared for. Today carbon steel knives are used mainly by 
  professionals who like the cutting feel.</p>
  <p>Other negatives are that that they can discolor some vegetables, 
  particularly eggplant, and can leave a faint metallic taste on acidic fruit 
  like lemons. They are brittle (but not nearly so brittle as ceramic knives), 
  so the tips can be broken if badly mistreated.</p>    
  </li>

<li><b>Stainless Steel:</b> &nbsp; The first stainless steel knives were 
  made of very corrosion resistant 300 series stainless. Pretty,  but 
  nearly worthless for cutting - which is why mid 20th century texts 
  tell you to avoid stainless knives.
  <p>With the advent of alloy 440A, stainless knives totally eclipsed the 
  carbon steel knife. Knives made from 440A and similar alloys are less 
  shiny and can show some signs of rust if mistreated. Marketeers call these 
  "high carbon stainless", but actually they're "high iron", not carbon. 
  Magnets will stick to them but will not stick to 300 series. You won't see 
  440A mentioned much any more because most makers now have their own 
  specialty alloy, though most are pretty close to 440A.</p>
  <p>Really cheap knives and late night TV specials are made of inferior 
  grades of stainless steel, for the simple reason that it's cheaper to 
  fabricate them from these softer grades.</p>
  <p>Good stainless steel knives do not rust (noticeably) and hold their edge 
  quite well. They can be as hard as or harder than carbon steel blades 
  if the manufacturer desires, but stainless is tough and less likely to chip 
  or break. They are, however, more difficult to sharpen, and the 
  "sharpening steel" is of little worth with these knives. They will not 
  discolor eggplant or leave a metallic taste on acidic fruit, even without 
  a costly titanium outer layer.</p>
  </li>
<li><b>Ceramic:</b> &nbsp; Ceramic knives are very useful for SCUBA divers, 
  bomb disposal teams and terrorists, but have limited use in the kitchen. 
  They chip and break rather easily and should not be used where they might 
  contact bone, frozen foods or other hard materials, and they must not be 
  dropped. Because of their fragility they are available in a limited range 
  of sizes.
  <p>Ceramic knives have one big advantage in the kitchen - the ceramic 
  material is so hard it can be used for a very long time before it needs 
  sharpening, and that is the main (only?) selling point. When it does need 
  sharpening only a diamond hone will do the job. Of course, if you learn 
  to sharpen your own knives as I suggest here, this feature is of limited 
  interest.</p></li>

<li><b>Hardness:</b> &nbsp; Much is made by some manufactures of the 
  hardness of their blades, fairly confident it will be meaningless to 
  customers. Hardness is measured, except for ceramic blades, on the 
  Rockwell C scale (Rc). Most stainless steel kitchen knife blades are 
  between Rc 54 and Rc 59. Japanese knives tend to be Rc 60 to Rc 62. 
  European makers stay around the soft end. I suspect this is because 
  so many people still insist on using the obsolete sharpening steel 
  which works best with a soft blade.
  <p>While harder blades hold an edge longer, you don't necessarily 
  want the hardest Rc you can get, because with hardness comes brittleness. 
  At around Rc 65 and up steel becomes so brittle it will shatter like glass. 
  There are methods to increase the hardness of surface and edge while 
  keeping the core relatively soft for strength.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="fab">Fabrication Methods</h3>

<p>There are two fabrication methods - forged from billet and stamped from 
sheet. Perfectly usable knives can be made by either method.

<ul>
<li><b>Forged Blade:</b>
<br><img src="img/kn_forge01k.jpg" alt="Forged Blade" class=mrg>
This is the best method for making knives. Despite what you may have read in 
foodie magazines, forged blades are not "cast". A cast blade would be 
unusably weak. A bar of steel is smashed into rough shape in a cavity mold 
by a giant forging press. The rough blank is then ground to final shape and 
finish. The objective of forging is to squish the metal, causing it to flow, 
resulting in a grain flow pattern that contributes to strength. From that 
point the metal must not be heated so hot the grain structure reforms.
<br class=cll></li>

<li><b>Stamped Blade:</b>
<br><img src="img/kn_roll01c.jpg" alt="Stamped Blade" class=mrg>
This method is less expensive, requires a lot less tooling and involves a 
lot less finishing work than forging. A giant press using a cutting die 
stamps the rough blank out of a sheet of metal of the desired thickness. It 
is then ground to final shape and finish. This would seem inferior to forging 
due to the grain flow issue, but it's  less inferior than you might expect. 
The sheet from which it is stamped is invariably cold rolled to thickness, 
providing a grain flow that, while not so ideal as forging, is still pretty 
good. Again, the metal must not be heated so hot the grain structure reforms.
<br class=cll></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="must">Knives You Must Have</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>General Prep Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_debaz.html">
<img src="img/kn_debam01d.jpg" alt="Deba Knife" class=mrg></a>
This is the knife you will have in your hand most of the time, so it's 
the one you want to spend your money on. It is most often a 
<a href="kn_chefz.html"><b>Chef's Knife</b></a>, a title that 
encompasses a wide and confusing range of sizes, shapes and prices. 
Myself, I very much prefer the <a href="kn_debaz.html">
<b>Mioroshi Deba</b></a> (photo), thicker, shorter and sturdier than a 
typical Chef's Knife but thinner and longer than a regular Deba.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Vegetable Slicing Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_vegz.html">
<img src="img/kn_santo01d.jpg" alt="Santoku Knife" class=mrg></a>
The premier vegetable slicing knives are the Santoku and Nakiri. They 
provide much greater precision than available from a Chef's knife or 
Deba. Unfortunately volumes of nonsense have been written about the 
Santoku, often calling it "the ideal knife" - but it's a fine 
<a href="kn_vegz.html"><b>Vegetable Slicing Knife</b></a> - 
nothing more. The Nakiri is more limited - it slices the same but has 
no point.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Utility / Cook's Knife</h3> and/or <h3>Paring Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_utilz.html">
<img src="img/kn_util01e.jpg" alt="Utility Knife" class=mrg></a>
<p>
Shown in the photo is my ancient Sabatier utility knife. Utility / Cook's 
knives run 5 to 6 inches long. Paring knives are similar but smaller and 
shorter (3-1/2 to 4 inches). Some specialty paring knives are as short as 
2-1/2 inches.
<a href="kn_utilz.html"><b>Utility Knife</b></a>.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Swivel Peeler</h3>
<br><a href="kn_peelz.html">
<img src="img/kn_peel08e.jpg" alt="Swivel Peelers" class=mrg></a>
This is why I don't own a paring knife. A Swivel Peeler peels much more 
easily, evenly and waaaaay faster. For any actual cutting, one of my 
regular kinives will do just fine.
<p>Of the two forms shown, I very greatly prefer the Y shaped draw 
knife form. It is much less fatiguing and more natural to hold than the 
traditional knife form. Most manufacturers now make both forms.
For more details see <a href="kn_peelz.html"><b>Swivel Vegetable 
Peeler</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>


<h3>Chinese Cleaver Knife - and Mallet</h3>
<br><a href="kn_chinaz.html">
<img src="img/kn_ccleaver03d.jpg" alt="Cleaver Knife and Mallet" class=mrg></a>

Enthusiasts of Chinese cuisine consider using no other knife, but it's 
nearly useless for Western style prep. The Cleaver Knife is a very good fit 
for the way things are cut in China, because in China things are cut that 
way because they cut with a Cleaver Knife (actually, they do have other 
knives in China).
<p>On the other hand, I wouldn't think of being without 
a razor sharp Chinese <a href="kn_chinaz.html"><b>Cleaver Knife</b></a> 
and a soft faced mallet with which to drive it through chickens, fish, 
spare ribs and many other stiff or hard foods, with perfect precision, 
cutting exactly where you want to cut.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>


<h2 id="nice">Knives Really Nice to Have</h2>

<p>These knives are excellent for the tasks for which they were designed, 
but if you don't do those tasks they won't be of much use to you.</p>


<h3>Bread Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_breadz.html">
<img src="img/kn_bread04f.jpg" alt="Bread Knife" class=mrg></a>
This is the one place you definitely want a knife with a serrated edge. This 
allows you to saw through the tough crust without applying so much pressure 
you crush the tender bread within.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Boning Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_bonez.html">
<img src="img/kn_bone01d.jpg" alt="Boning Knife" class=mrg></a>
Great for separating meat from bone with a minimum of effort and a 
minimum of waste, but of little use to the vegetarian. The 
<a href="kn_bonez.html"><b>Boning Knife</b></a> must be razor sharp to 
be of much use. Stone it early and often.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Filleting Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_fillz.html">
<img src="img/kn_fillet01d.jpg" alt="Filleting Knife" class=mrg></a>
Designed for disassembling fish, this thin flexible knife with a razor 
edge is excellent for that task, but pretty useless for anything else. 
The <a href="kn_fillz.html"><b>Filleting Knife</b></a> <u>must</u> be 
accompanied by a stone because its delicate edge needs to be resharpened 
often, usually before the next fish.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3 id="steak">Steak Knives</h3>
<br><a href="kn_steakz.html">
<img src="img/kn_steak02e.jpg" alt="Steak Knives" class=mrg></a>
This is a great place to waste money. Yes, if you serve large hunks of 
meat on a plate, each person needs a steak knife. You can get a nice set 
of six Wusthof Classic steak knives for only 2020 US $528 (that's list, 
don't pay more than $350 on the Intenet - what a bargain!). Of course 
they'll be dull where they touch the plate in no time. That's why most 
steak knives are serrated, so only the peaks touch the plate and get dull. 
Unfortunately, serrated knives don't cut, they shred and tear - quite 
unpleasant and considered bad form.
<p>I buy my non-serrated <a href="kn_steakz.html"><b>Steak Knives</b></a> 
at a local Asian market for $1.39 each. They work just fine and it takes 
only a moment to stone the tips sharp after use (only 1/2 inch or so up 
near the tip ever touches the plate and gets dull). You just don't need 
a super-knife for this application - unless your purpose is to show off.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Julienne Swivel Peeler</h3>
<br><a href="kn_peelz.html#juli">
<img src="img/kn_peelj04e.jpg" alt="Julienne Peeler" class=mrg></a>
This looks like a regular vegetable peeler, but it has a row of slicing teeth 
behind the cutting blade which slice the peel into narrow strips. It can 
save a lot of time, particularly with carrots. You can use the narrow strips 
as is, or chop them crosswise for uniformly tiny pieces.
<p>The photo specimen is "Titan" brand and is excellent. I also own an 
Oxo, a device Oxo should be thoroughly ashamed of. For more details see 
our <a href="kn_peelz.html#juli"><b>Julienne Peeler</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Meat Cleaver</h3>
<br><a href="kn_cleavz.html">
<img src="img/kn_cleavmal05d.jpg" alt="Meat Cleaver" class=mrg></a>
Actually this knife is used on bones not meat. It's very useful for splitting 
bones for use in making soup stock. About the stupidest thing I've ever read 
about knives is, "It's not important for a meat cleaver to be sharp". The 
hell it isn't! The edge of your Meat Cleaver should be stoned as sharp 
as any other knife, <b>just at a steeper angle</b> to make a more durable 
edge. The last thing you want is a dull cleaver that skids rather than 
bites - sending heavy bones flying across your kitchen breaking stuff. 
For details and usage see our 
<a href="kn_cleavz.html"><b>Meat Cleaver</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Mezzaluna</h3>
<br><a href="kn_mezzaz.html">
<img src="img/kn_mezza02h.jpg" alt="Mezaluna Knife" class=mrg></a>
This knife is used mainly in the Mediterranean region and by people from 
there. It is particularly used for chopping the large amounts of fresh herbs 
used in that region. The herbs are piled on the cutting board and the knife 
is rocked smoothly back and forth rather than chopping up and down.
<p> There are also versions that have a single bridge handle you grasp in 
the center like a Ulu, and versions with more than one blade for even faster 
chopping. For details see our 
<a href="kn_mezzaz.html"><b>Mezzaluna</b></a> page.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Ulu</h3>
<br><a href="kn_uluz.html">
<img src="img/kn_ulu01h.jpg" alt="Ulu" class=mrg></a>
Superficially similar to the Mezzaluna, but differing greatly in use, this 
knife is very popular in Alaska. It is used for general slicing, chopping, 
boning meat, scraping hides and many other tasks.
<p>The photo specimen is an example of a native 
<a href="kn_uluz.html"><b>Alaskan Ulu</b></a>, hand made, probably from 
an old sawmill blade. It has seen at least 50 years of service.

<p>Fancier versions can be ordered from various sources in Alaska and from 
some knife vendors. These vendors also sell a concave chopping block to go 
with them - but I have it on expert authority this is not authentic, but 
aimed at the non-native market. In their natural environment 
these knives are used against either a flat block or a hide depending on 
what is being cut.

<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Oyster Knife / Clam Knife</h3>
<br><a href="kn_oystz.html">
<img src="img/kn_oyster01h.jpg" alt="Oyster Knife" class=mrg></a>
Actually not a knife but a pry bar - the edges are quite dull. An oyster 
knife is shown, a clam knife is much the same but with a longer blade. The 
photo specimen is from Oxo and is a little odd in that most 
<a href="kn_oystz.html"><b>Oyster Knives</b></a> have a larger flange 
where the handle meets the blade. I didn't find the smaller flange to be a 
problem, but the blade proved a bit soft and bendy for our huge Pacific 
oysters.
<br class=cll><p></p>
<br>


<h2 id="other">Other Cutting Devices</h2> 
<p></p>

<h3>Mandolin</h3>
<br><a href="kn_mandoz.html">
<img src="img/kn_mando03h.jpg" alt="Mandolin" class=mrg></a>
This is a very flexible device and a tremendous help when you need to cut 
or slice a lot of vegetables. Shown in the photo is the Oxo 1054752. Not 
only does this device slice to any thickness you wish to set (up to about 
3/8 inch) but it will also julienne, cut fries, and do ripple cuts as well 
as straight cuts. I use mine mainly for cutting cucumbers and potatoes, 
and other things that must be cut thin and <u>very uniform in 
thickness</u>
<p>Keep one thing in mind - the <a href="kn_mandoz.html"><b>Mandolin</b></a> 
is a <b><u>very dangerous device</u></b> which should be used only by 
consenting adults who are not currently impaired by drugs or alcohol, or 
working under distraction, and must be kept completely away from children 
and teens. Accidents with a mandolin don't just cut, they commonly take 
a chunk of flesh, and heal slowly.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>


<h2 id="sharp">Sharpening</h2>

<p>Every article I read about knives tries to protect you from the truth - 
and the truth is, you have to learn to sharpen your own knives - and you 
have to learn to do it with stones. Forget about motorized knife 
sharpeners. At best they remove too much metal, eventually ruining your 
precious knives, which should last a lifetime, and at worst they do a 
lousy job of sharpening. They are partuclarly bad with knives that use a 
finer edge, or are sharpened from one side only.</p>
<p>This subject is so important I've written a separate page about 
<a href="kn_sharp.html"><b>Sharpening Knives</b></a> - and no, it really 
isn't that hard. If you can learn to slice thin, you can learn to sharpen, 
and the rewards are great.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="care">Care &amp; Usage</h2>
<p></p>
<h3 id="do">Dos and Don'ts</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Knives are very dangerous:</b> &nbsp; Keep that in mind. They 
  would as soon cut you as anything else, and they are particularly 
  dangerous if not kept properly sharp, or if placed where they could be 
  contacted accidentally. When using knives, avoid distractions, and keep 
  them away from children and teens. Always store them properly (see 
  below).</li>
<li><b>Never, never put knives in the sink.</b> &nbsp; Doing so is very 
  dangerous for your hands, the most common cause of serious injury in 
  restaurants. It will also result in dull and damaged cutting edges. 
  Knives should stay on the cutting board until hand cleaned and properly 
  packed or stored.</li>
<li><b>Never put knives in the dishwasher</b>. Aside from being hard on 
  the knives, particularly the handles, it's just an accident waiting to 
  happen.</li>
<li><b>Never store knives in a drawer</b>, unless the blades are 
  completely covered by a sturdy sheath intended for that kind of 
  storage. Storing them bare will just about guarantee the cutting edge 
  will become damaged, and it's very dangerous for fingers and hands.
  </li>
<li><b>Do Not Ever</b> cut against a glass, ceramic, metal or other hard 
  surface. Your knife will be instantly dulled at the point of contact. 
  The only situation where this is allowed is with 
  <a href="kn_steakz.html"><b>Steak Knives</b></a>.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Scrape</b> stuff around on your cutting board with the 
  sharp edge of the knife - that's what the back side of the knife is 
  for. Develop the habit of automatically rotating your wrist when 
  scraping. It is OK to scoop stuff up with the sharp edge though.</li>
<li><b>Use a Proper Cutting Board:</b> &nbsp; That will be a hardwood or 
  plastic board made expressly for cutting use. Tests have shown there 
  is no hygienic advantage to one or the other, so choose based on your 
  preference. I strongly prefer a very thick end grain wood cutting board. 
  If you move your board around a lot you may prefer something lighter.
  Butchers here in California use plastic because wood end block doesn't 
  stand up well to the constant steam cleaning required by regulations.  
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="store">Proper Storage</h2>

<p>Knives should stay on the cutting surface until properly cleaned and 
put away. A household cleanser does a fine job of cleaning, but remember 
to clean the handle too, it could have acquired bacteria. Stainless 
knives can be put away as soon as they are dry. Carbon steel knives 
should be given a light coating of oil wiped on with a piece of paper 
towel. Mine are exposed to the elements at an often open window, so they 
have a black oxide patina.  This does no harm, provides some protection 
from red rust and holds oil better than bare metal.</p>


<h3>Knife Blocks</h3>
<br><img src="img/kn_block01c.jpg" alt="Knife Block" class=mrg>
<b><u>A bad idea</u></b>. These tempting goodies are particularly used 
as an incentive to buy knives in sets. They are very pretty if you have 
plenty of extra counter space and never use your knives. In a real 
kitchen where knives are used under often hectic conditions, they will 
soon become repositories for mold, fungus and bacteria of all kinds. 
Yumm! They are not cleanable. Knives bought in sets are usually not all 
ideally suited to your actual usage anyway.

</small><br class=cll><p></p>

<h3>Magnetic Knife Rack</h3>
<br><img src="img/kn_rackmag01h.jpg" alt="Magnetic Knife Rack" class=mrg>
Magnetic knife racks are very popular and a practical way to keep knives 
safely out of the way but instantly available. Most sold for household use 
are about half the length of the one in the photo - but that's the only 
decent photo I could find. The rack should be mounted in a location 
that's easy to reach, but where no damage will be done should you 
accidently let one slip while you rack or retrieve it.
<p>Of course these racks will not hold ceramic knives, nor knives made of 
"real" stainless (300 series), but this material has mercifully gone out 
of use for knives.

<h3>Wood Knife Rack</h3>
<br><img src="img/kn_rack02k.jpg" alt="Knife Rack" class=mrg>
Wood racks can be ideal for knife storage - but you'll probably have to 
make your own or have one made. The one shown is mine, made from a strip 
of bare unfinished oak cut into three pieces. The slotted top rail is 
indented in the center so knives won't accidentally slip out of their 
slots, but they can easily be lifted slightly and brought out straight 
forward.<p></p>

<p>You can just see the wire bale (made from a painted clothes hanger) 
that keeps the badly balanced knives (utility knife and santoku) from 
doing a back flip out the window. This rack has seen daily service for 
maybe 30 years.

<h3>Drawer Storage</h3>
<br><img src="img/kn_sheath02e.jpg" alt="Knife Sheath" class=mrg>
You may wish to store less often used knives in a drawer. To protect the 
knife. and your hands, a proper storage protector is <u>essential</u>. 
There are a number of economical varieties available. The one shown is by 
Lamson-sharp, available in sizes for knives from 3 inches to 10 inches. 
Victorinox has magnetically secured folders and there are plain sheaths 
available from other vendors.
