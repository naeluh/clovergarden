<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Aluminum Cookware is very popular because of its light 
weight, good heat characteristics, and low cost. Due to the softness 
and low corrosion resistance of bare Aluminum, various coatings are 
applied, particularly anodizing and "non-stick" coatings, which are 
mostly applied over Aluminum, though some can also be applied over 
steel.

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; Safety</h2>

<p>Aluminum is highly reactive. It is rapidly dissolved by acids (many 
foods) and alkalis (many cleaning preparations). The health impact of 
aluminum dissolved in food and ingested is the subject of considerable 
debate. A while ago aluminum was a major suspect in Alzheimers disease, 
but this view is currently out of favor. In any case, aluminum, a metal, 
can't be good for the flavor of your food.</p>

<p>Today bare and lightly anodized aluminum cookware appears almost 
entirely in bakeware and restaurant equipment: stock pots, very 
large saut&eacute; pans and the like - mainly used for non-acidic 
foods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while aluminum is toxic, the dosage you are likely 
to get from aluminum cookware is very small. Way higher dosages come 
from antacids, antiperspirants, baking soda and some cosmetics.</p> 

<p>Aluminum cookware for the home is now pretty much all "hard anodized". 
This is an acid-electric treatment that builds up a film of extremely 
hard and non-reactive aluminum oxide, temperature resistant to the 
melting point of aluminum. This coating may be colored but most anodized 
cookware is charcoal or black.</p>

<p>This anodized surface is also non-porous, thus quite non-stick, and on 
basis of the anodizing, this cookware is declared entirely safe, 
regardless of you opinion of the safety of underlying aluminum itself.
Hard Anodized Aluminum is used particularly for skillets, saut&eacute; 
pans and other stovetop cooking applications.</p>

<p>Like all coatings, this coating is vulnerable. It can be broken by 
scratches. While it is very hard itself, it is supported by a rather soft 
aluminum metal underlay. It is also eventually dissolved in normal use by 
the acids and alkalis it is exposed to in cooking and cleaning. When you 
start seeing silvery patches on your cookware, it's time it was replaced.
</p>

<h2>Non-Stick Coatings</h2>

<p>Non-stick cookware is a very attractive idea, but one that rarely lives 
up to its promise. Some chefs like to have a non-stick pan for scrambled 
eggs, but beyond that most do not favor non-stick cookware. Photo at the 
top is of a Cuisinart skillet, quite suitable for eggs.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with non-stick coatings is fragility. I'm sure 
better non-stick cookware measures up to the manufacturer's claims in 
the laboratory, but the kitchen is not a laboratory environment. At best 
it's an industrial environment, and at worst resembles a combat 
zone. Tools will be abused, accidents will happen and non-stick cookware 
is particularly vulnerable.</p>

<p>There are basically two non-stick coatings, though they may go under 
various names: PTFE (Teflon), and Ceramic.</p>

<h3>PTFE Coatings</h3>

<p>The first non-stick coating applied to aluminum pans was 
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known as Teflon. It is still in 
use, and properly applied over a Hard Anodized surface (but may not be 
in cheaper products). It is, however, easily scraped off. Some better 
brands use up to 5 layers variously applied to counter this, but even 
so, experts say to expect no more than 3 years from PTFE coated pans, 
even if you use wood and plastic utensils.

<p>The other problem with PTFE coatings is temperature. They start 
to degrade seriously above 450&deg;F/230&deg;C. Above 500&deg;F the 
toxic fumes are so bad they can kill pet birds. You certainly don't 
want to use PTFE for applications like stir frying, which regularly 
exceed 450&deg;F. The wisp of smoke you see from you wok should be 
oil smoke, not hydrofluoric acid fumes. For this reason, teflon coated 
wire is not allowed in submarines and aircraft.</p>

<p>Back in 2009, Good Housekeeping had a well referenced article on 
non-stick cookware. It's gone now, but it included these recommendations. 
</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Never preheat an empty pan.</li>
  <li>Don't cook on high heat.</li>
  <li>Ventilate your kitchen.</li>
  <li>Don't broil or sear meats.</li>
  <li>Choose a heavier non-stick pan.</li>
  <li>Avoid chipping or damaging a pan.</li>
  </ol>  
  <br>

<h3>Ceramic Non-Stick</h3> 

<p>The more recent Non-Stick coating is variously described as 
Ceramic and "Eco-Friendly. Some even claims to be "Diamond-Infused" 
for greater durability. Basically, its made of silica and titanium, 
and is a form of glass. Like glass it can chip and be destroyed by 
heat shock. Resistance to heat shock varies by brand.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of this coating is that it can easily go to 
600&deg;F/315&deg;C without degrading or emitting toxic fumes. This 
is the kind of coating used on the Gotham Steel
<a href="ke_grillez.html"><b>Electric Grill / Griddle</b></a> mentioned 
on this site, and yes, it can chip if abused. It is not recommended to 
put most ceramic coated cookware in the dishwasher, but to hand clean.
</p>

<p>Using the Gotham Steel griddle, I have found claims that you 
don't need oil to be exaggerated. It works much better with oil, and I 
expect other ceramic coated aluminum products are similar. Don't worry 
about that - the <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> 
has been <u>entirely discredited</u>, but some people are still making 
money off of it.</p>
