<h3>Baking Sheet</h3> &nbsp; 
If you have an oven, Baking Sheets are essentil. That in the photo is a 
"Half Sheet" size, 18 x 13 inches (46 x 33 cm) of heavy gage aluminum sheet. 
This is the largest size that will fit in most ovens in North America.
<p></p>

<h3>Wire Rack</h3> &nbsp; This is a multi-use item. It can be used outside 
the Baking Sheet as a cooling or drying rack. It can be used with the 
Baking Sheet for roasting many foods. For instance: line the baking sheet 
with aluminum foil. Place marinated chicken wings on the rack. Roast at 
400&deg;F / 200 &deg; C. The rack in the photo is Nordic Ware, purchased 
for 2021 US $18.18, and perfectly sized for a Half Sheet Baking Pan.
