<h1>Mixing Bowls</h1>

<p>One of those things you can't do without. The folks at Los Angeles Times 
Test Kitchen have said how much they love their glass mixing bowls. I have 
some, but never use them. A home kitchen is not a laboratory or demo kitchen, 
it is an industrial production facility at best, a war zone at worst.</p> 
<p>Stainless steel bowls are light, unbreakable and stack well to save storage 
space. This stack contains 14 bowls, with multiples of the most used sizes. 
Bowls like these are easily available from restaurant supply stores - they're 
what the pros use. Not shown is my 15 inch bowl, really handy for mixing party 
salads.</p>
