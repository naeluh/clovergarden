<h1>Ceramic Stovetop Cookware</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Long before metal cookware was available cooking was done 
on open fires and/or buried in ashes in pottery cookware. Even Irish 
cauldrons were made of clay in early times. This cookware was not hard 
glazed stoneware, but porous pottery, terracota and similar. Pots of this 
sort are still widely used today.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; History</h2>

<p>Even the Irish cauldron was originally made of clay. Later it was made 
of bronze (from when the Celts invaded) and iron (from the Roman Empire).  
Most other cultures around the world also cooked in clay pots of various 
description, and this cookware has modern decendents in most of these 
cultures.</p>
<p>The reason these primitive pots have survived and are still made today 
is the superior results they produce for slow cooked soups, stews and bean 
dishes.</p>
<br>


<h2 id="use">Using Clay Cookware</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In general (unless the manufacturer says otherwise), a clay pot 
    that's new or hasn't been used for some time is soaked in water for 
    about 8 hours. After that, before each use it's soaked only for 5 
    minutes to an hour, depending on type.</li>
  <li>Always start on a cold burner with very low well distributed heat. 
    Heat should be gradually increased but should never exceed low-medium. 
    It is never necessary because clay pot cooking is always slow cooking.
    </li>
  <li>If you have an electric stove or one with ceramic burners, use a 
    heat diffuser between the burner and the cookware.</li>
  <li>When taking the cookware off the heat, never set on a metal, tile, 
    stone or other surface with good heat conductivity. Wood, cork, a 
    folded  towel and the like are fine.</li>
  <li>Cook only fairly liquid recipes in clay pots - soups and stews. They 
    are not for frying or other dry cooking. If doing a braise, brown the 
    meat in a skillet, then add it to the clay pot with the other 
    ingredients.</li>
  <li>Do not ever allow a clay pot to remain on the heat with nothing in 
    it.</li>
  <li>All of the cookware on this page can also be used in the oven, but 
    its best not to preheat the oven, so add a little time to the recipe.
    </li>
  <li>Despite all these precautions, a clay pot can still crack. For 
    hairline cracks Paula Wolfert says she's had great success simmering 
    them in milk - the insoluble casein penetrates and acts like glue.
    </li>

<h2 id="var">Common Stovetop Clay Cookware</h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id="sand">Chinese Sand Pot</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmsand07d.jpg" alt="Sand Pots" class=mrg>
These clay pots are still very much used in China, so they are easily 
available from Asian markets in North America, and in a number of sizes. 
Aside from the shapes shown, the low form is also made with a handle on 
the side.These pots are made from a type of clay said to be available 
only in China. They are glazed on the inside, except around the 
rim, but only in a few patches on the outside.
<p>Clay pot cooking expert Paula Wolfert suggests using these for European 
clay pot recipes because they can be had cheaply at Asian markets, while 
European clay is really quite expensive.</p>
<p> Some say these can be used on the stovetop without previously soaking 
in water, but I don't press my luck. The low photo specimen is 8-1/2 inches 
diameter, 3 inches deep and has a practical cooking capacity of 5 cups. 
The tall one is 8-1/2 inches diameter, 9 inches tall and has a practical 
capacity of 22 cups.

<h3 id="cazuela">Spanish Cazuela</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmcazu02e.jpg" alt="Handled Cazuela" class=mrg>
These clay pots have been used in Spain since the time of the Roman Empire 
and are still very much used today, both on the stove top and in the oven. 
They are made round and oval, with handle and without, and in many sizes. 
Traditionally they are without a lid, though some are made as lidded 
casseroles today. Stewing pots (Olla) are also made of the same clay, but 
always have lids.
<p>As with other clay pots these need a long soak in water before you 
can use them on the stovetop for the first time. A wide selection of 
excellent cazuelas is available from <a href="kp_ceram.html#c01">La Tienda</a>.

<h3 id="terra">Italian Terracota</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmital02e.jpg" alt="Terracota Pot" class=mrg>
Italians are very big on cooking in clay, and make terracota (baked earth) 
cookware of every shape and size. This cookware is glazed in many brilliant 
colors, except the bottom. It should be prepared for use by soaking as with 
the other clay cookware. Even if a piece were glazed all over (which this is 
not) soaking would be in order. A wide selection is available from 
<a href="kp_ceram.html#c01">Terra Allegra Imports</a> or retailers carrying their 
products.

<h3 id="donabe">Japanese Donabe</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmdonab02e.jpg" alt="Donabe" class=mrg>
These pots are still very much used in Japan and many sizes, shapes and 
decorative patterns are sold in North America, from US $15 on up. The 
photo specimen is fairly small at 7-1/2 inches diameter and 2-1/8 inches 
deep. It was purchased in an Asian market in Los Angeles, but I don't 
remember where or how much I paid for it. Donabe are generally 
attractively decorated because they are often carried to the table when 
cooking is done, or the cooking may be done at the table.
<p>Seasoning instructions vary, but the most common are: (1) Fill it with 
water and leave it overnight, (2) Fill it with water and slowly heat it to 
a slow simmer for at least 1 hour, Let cool naturally. (3) Fill it 80% with 
water. Add cooked rice until it is completely full. Heat slowly and simmer 
for at least one hour. Let cool naturally. <u>All agree on one point</u> - . 
the outside bottom should be completely dry before placing it on the burner.

<h3 id="tagine">Moroccan Tagine</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmtajin01e.jpg" alt="Unglazed Taginet" class=mrg>
It seems everybody and his dog is making tagines these days, out of 
whatever materials (All Clad had one for US $200), but real ones 
are made out of unglazed or partially glazed clay - and you can get one 
like the photo for US $44 from <a href="kp_ceram.html#c04">Berber Trading Co.</a>. 
Note that glazed tagines with fancy decorations are used for serving only, 
never for cooking.
<p>The results from a clay tagine improve with repeated use, which can't be 
said of metal and ceramic coated versions. Berber Trading's recommendations 
for seasoning are: (1) soak in water for more than 1 hour. (2) Let dry for 
5 minutes. (3) Rub the inside of the base and lid generously with olive oil. 
(4) Place in a cold oven and set the temperature to 350&deg;F/177&deg;C and 
bake for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. (5) Turn off the oven and let cool naturally.

<h3 id="chamba">Columbian La Chamba</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_cmcham01e.jpg" alt="Casserole" class=mrg>
Made of micaceous clay, these pots are strong and stand up well to direct 
heat. They can be found on  the Web, from folks like <a href="kp_ceram.html#c03">
<b>Ancient Cookware</b></a>. Paula Wolfert says to season them by 
pouring in milk to 1 inch deep, then bringing slowly to a simmer and 
simmering for 30 minutes, then let cool slowly before draining. Rinse 
and dry.
