<h1>Double Boiler / Bain Marie</h1>

<ul>
<li>A <b>Double Boiler</b> is a pan that has rapidly simmering water 
below the level of the pan and is surrounded and heated by steam. It 
is often used for making delicate sauces, especially those containing 
egg yolks, but is also used for melting chocolate, making candy, 
making candles, etc. It is a stovetop device, and the contents is often 
stirred continuously or at least often.
<p></p></li>
<li>A <b>Bain Marie</b> is a water bath, with hot water surrounding the 
pan the sauce (or whatever) is in. This technique is most often used 
in the oven, especially for custards and the like where a bunch of 
ramekins of custard are cooked in a shallow pan of water. It is also 
sometimes use on the stovetop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you need such a device depends entirely on what kind of 
cooking you do - it may be essential, or useless. With a double boiler, 
you can make delicate sauces with confidence, and with less attention 
than would be required directly on the burner. They are also used for 
melting chocolate, making candy, and other tasks.</p>

<h3>Double Boiler</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_dubboi05d.jpg" alt="Copper / Ceramic Double Boiler" class=mrg>
This is my lovely copper and ceramic double boiler. I don't know where I 
got it, or when, but I'm sure I didn't pay retail for it. The ceramic pan 
holds 8 cups, which is sufficient to make 6 cups of sauce. It is heavy 
and a bit too big for what I'm usually doing, so it gets very little 
use. Most commercial double boilers sold today are all stainless steel, 
which is more practical. Multi-ply is a waste of money, because the bottom pan will 
be doing nothing but simmering water, and the top pan is evenly bathed 
in steam.
<p>The lid is often little used while making sauces, because most sauces 
that need a double boiler require almost constant stirring, but the lid 
will help keep the sauce warm when it's done, and keep the surface 
moist.

<h3>Double Boiler Insert</h3>

These are popular for making small amounts of sauces, melting chocolate, 
making candy, and making candles. Most hold 2 cups, but this 600 ml one 
holds about 2-1/3 cups. A lid is not provided, but the lower pan's lid 
can serve if a tight seal isn't needed, like keeping it warm for a few 
minutes. This one was purchased from Amazon for 2020 US $10.86.

<h3>Jury Rig Stovetop Bain Marie</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_dubboi02f.jpg" alt="Jurry Rig Bain Marie" class=mrg>
This is what I'm much more 
likely to be using. I threw this together to make a cup and a half of 
Polish White Lemon Sauce, which is very much like a Greek sauce, with 
lemon juice and thickened with egg yolks. The egg yolks will curdle 
if they hit a simmer. The Windsor Pan being tilted looks rinky dink, 
but is actually an advantage, as the pan barely touches the mixing bowl 
and is totally wrapped in water.
<p>I did most of the cooking in the Windsor Pan directly on the burner. 
When I was ready to finish it with the egg yolks, I just put a mixing 
bowl with water under it, stirred in the egg yolks, and brought the 
sauce up to a nice 180 &deg;F over low heat, stirring often, but not 
constantly.

<h3>Jury Rig Double Boiler</h3> &nbsp; Here we have a more 
formal arrangement, and a true double boiler. It's just a stainless 
mixing bowl set in the top of a large saucepan. It would be better if 
the bowl fit more snuggly, but I didn't have a pan and bowl that fit 
better. Again, the lid is not much used when making the sauce, but 
a good thing for keeping it warm and moist once it's done.<p></p>
