Many coffee fanatics consider this to be the very best device for brewing 
Coffee, but I find it also perfect for making Tea from loose leaves, 
especially if you make it very strong to be diluted to taste with hot 
boiled water. It is also a convenient method for making 
<a href="../recipes/axv_mate1.html"><b>Mat&eacute;</b></a>, as the 
traditional method requires both an experienced cebador and well trained 
guests. 

<p>The photo specimen is a 34 ounce (100 cl), the size I consider most 
useful, but 12 oz (35 cl) and 51 oz (150 cl) are also available. I bought 
the photo specimen more than 25 years ago from Cost Plus (now World Market). 
What I paid for it I could not remember, but similar units are available 
on-line for US 2022 $16 to $60, in both glass and metal.
