<h1>Glass Stovetop Cookware</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Regular glass cookware, even Pyrex, is not really suitable for 
stovetop cooking. In the mid 1950s Corning Glass Works found a way to 
solidify glass (which is normally a supercooled liquid) into a 
ceramic-like form, and in 1958 released CorningWare.</span>

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; History</h2>

<p>The only company I've heard of that has developed glass cookware suitable 
for the stovetop is Corning Glass Works. They had two lines, CorningWare 
(opaque) and Visions (transparent). They discontinued production in the 
late 1990s but some production has been revived in 2009.</p>
<p>The brands now belong to Corelle (formerly World Kitchen), and they 
are selling a limited line of both products from their Web store. Most 
of Corelle products under the CorningWare brand are not glass but regular 
ceramic products not usable on the stovetop.</p>

<h3 id="corn">CorningWare Pyroceram</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_glpyro01e.jpg" alt="CorningWare" class=mrg>
Shown here are Pyrocerm items currently sold by Corelle on their Web site. 
The Pyroceram product has a very good reputation and is legendary for 
being able to be moved directly from freezer to stovetop without breaking. 
Because it lasts forever repeat customers have been a problem. The 
lids are Pyrex, another famous brand name now owned by Corelle.

<h3 id="vision">Visions</h3>
<br><img src="img/kp_glvision01e.jpg" alt="Visions Cookware" class=mrg>
This cookware has been popular, but is more fragile than Pyroceram, though 
people have admitted to abusing it fairly severely without problems. The 
downside is that there have been scattered reports of Visions cookware 
simply exploding into tiny fragments when not under particularly severe 
stress. High stress testing has been done without being able to duplicate 
this failure. Shown in the photo are items currently sold by Corelle from 
their Web site. The lids are Pyrex, another famous brand name now owned 
by Corelle.
