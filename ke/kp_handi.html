<p>This is a popular clay pot in India, made in various sizes and with 
some variation in shape. The photo example is 8-1/2 inches (22 cm) diameter 
and holds 9 cups (2 litre). Handis may come with or without lids.

most classic form, which has also been made in cast bronze. It may or may not

famous for Keralla Fish Curry, but is also used in other ways. It should be 
seasoned before use, see below.

<h2 id=caut>Cautions</h2>
<ul>
<li>These pots are intended for oven or open flame. If used on an electric 
  stove a heat defuser must be used on the burner.</li>
<li>Use moderate to low heat for all cooking.</li>
<li>Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Never set a hot pot on a cold 
  surface. It can be set on a folded towel, or on wood.</li>
<li> Never put the pot in a preheated oven. place in a cold oven so it 
  can come up to temperature gradually.</li>
<li>Do not use soap or detergent to clean, it can get into pores and 
  taint food.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="seas">Seasoning Indian Clay Pots</h2>

<ul>
<li>Soak in water 8 hrs or overnight.</li>
<li>Wipe clean with a scouring sponge.</li>
<li>Set in the Sun until completely dry.</li>
<li>Rub all over generously with oil.</li>
<li>Set in the sun for a full day. The oil will soak in.</li>
<li>Fill with rice water and let sit overnight. Some say three days with a 
  change of rice water every day. Rice water is from the first washing of 
  white rice, and should be quite hazy.</li>
<li>Over moderate heat bring rice water to a boil. Let cool completely.</li>
<li>Clean well with a damp sponge - no soap or detergent - they can get into 
  the pores and harm food flavors.</li>
<li>Place some oil in it, and some onion slices. Bring up to frying 
  temperature over very moderate flame, fry the onions until well translucent.
  It is now ready for use.
  </li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="crack">Hairline Cracks</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Some say to re-season, but instead of rice water use water with a cup of 
  cooked rice.</li>
<li>&Uuml;ber expert Paula Wolfert says she has had great success filling 
a clay pot with milk and bringing it to a simmer for awhile.</li>
</ul>
