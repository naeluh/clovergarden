Idli Steamers are a household essential in South India and the Tamil 
regions of Sri Lanka. Idlis are soft steamed cakes made from a fermented 
batter of Rice and Urad Dal. They are particularly served for breakfast, 
usually with Chutneys, or a spicy Sambar or Rasam, but are also a popular 
street food farther north in Mumbai.

<p>These pans normally have a stack of four trays, but six tray ones 
are available. Going that high may risk uneven cooking from bottom to 
top. Some, The photo specimen is Premiere brand and available for 2020 
US $37.99 from Amazon. The trays are nonstick coated, which is fine 
for this device, as it will never be exposed to high temperatures, and 
the trays can be easily cleaned with a soft plastic scouring pad. Those 
that are bare stainless steel will need more of a wipe of oil, but I 
recommend a light wiping with oil for the non-stick as well</p>

<p>note the whistle on the lid. This is very important, as it allows 
you to accurately control the boiling when you can't see it. If it's 
not whistling, it isn't steaming, but if the whistle is too loud, 
the boiling is too intense and may splash water up on the lower 
tray.</p>

<p>To make Idlies, Rice and Urad Dal are separately soaked, Then they 
are separately ground to a thick batter. Finally, they are mixed and 
set out to ferment. In very warm regions this can be as little as 5 
hours, but overnight is better, and in cooler regions, longer. Finally, 
the batter is poured into lightly oiled Idli Molds and placed in the 
steamer. Steaming usually takes 12 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This is the same batter used to make Dosa, thin lacy pancakes, except 
the proportion of Urad Dal is usually higher for Idli, and it is quite a 
bit thicker. Dosa batter needs to be thinner to spread in the properly 
on a hot griddle, comal or tava. For full details see our recipe

<p>The best machine for grinding these batters is an Indian 
<a href="ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, or for larger production, 
a <a href="ke_wetgrndz.html"><b>Wet Grinder</b></a>. If you don't 
have one of either, you can make the batters in a powerful blender, 
though with a little more hassle, and the batter might not be quite 
as smooth.</p>
