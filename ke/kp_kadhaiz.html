<h1>Kadhai / Karahi</h1>

<p>
This is the primary cooking pan in India, where it is used for many tasks. It 
looks much like an East Asian wok, but it differs in having a tighter radius 
and higher sides. This geometry makes it the best pan for deep frying there is 
anywhere - you can fry with a minimum of oil, and with amazingly little 
splatter escaping the pan. The high sides keep both the oil and the heat in 
where they belong.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the ultimate geometry for deep frying would be 
developed in India. A great deal of deep frying is done there, particularly 
by street vendors but also in the home, and both fuel and oil are very 
expensive there.</p>

<p>Of course in India the kadhai is used for far more than deep frying. 
Many Indian curries and stews are configured for this type of pan, and some 
have the word "kadhai" in their title. It is not, however, ideal for Chinese 
style stir frying because of the high, steep sides. You can't park stuff 
up on the sides like you can with a wok.

<p>The photo specimen, which I use for all my deep frying, regardless of 
ethnicity, is 14-1/2 inches diameter, made of heavy sheet steel formed in 
a press (thus some rippling around the edges). It was purchased from an 
Indian appliance store in Los Angeles. Some North American stores advertise 
stainless steel kadhais - do not buy them. They do not season well, are soon 
very ugly looking from baked on oil that's turned to varnish, and stainless 
steel is a poor conductor of heat. Aluminum is also to be avoided as it can 
taint acidic foods.</p>

The downside of the kadhai is the same as for the traditional wok, it 
is designed for a completely different kind of stove than we have in 
North America - one that has an opening the pan sits in and is intensely 
hot in the very center rather than in a ring like our gas stoves. For deep 
frying I have found the exact distribution of heat is far less important 
than it is for stir frying.</p>
<p>A wok stand is necessary to use a kadhai on our stoves, and I strongly 
favor the wire stand shown in the photo to the common sheet metal ring stand. 
Heat flow is much more natural. Note from the photo that I have cut gaps 
in the wire so it sits very securely on my burner and brings the pan 
close to the flame.</p>
<p>I do have a regular sheet metal ring stand which I set out of the way 
on the kitchen floor. That way I can quickly move a hot kadhai off the 
stove and out of the way when I'm done with it.
