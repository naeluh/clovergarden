This is a 16 inch diameter electric griddle offering a large amount of real 
estate suitable for Lefse, a thin Norwegian flatbread often made by 
Norwegians from wheat flour and potatoes, or by Norwegians in the American 
Midwest from just potatoes.

<p>This griddle works very well also for African flatbreads, including as a 
Mitad for Ethopian Injera, which may be quite large. For these you need 
the lid, which is not used for Lefse, so the lid is sold separately. It 
also works well for Chipattis, Appam, and Tortillas.</p>

<p>This griddle can also serve for regular griddle work where you 
need a large area, such as frying a whole lot of eggs, sunny side up, 
making a lot of pancakes, etc.</p>

<h3>Buying:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example is by Bethany Housewares, Inc. 
as their "Heritage Grill". It's the non-stick version, but is also available 
in a polished aluminum version. It goes up to 500&deg;F/260&deg;C, and 
temperature uniformity is quite good. If it will be used at higher temperature 
for more than 1-1/2 hour, Bethany recommends buying a second controller to swap 
in as needed. Because Lefse does not need a lid, the lid is sold separately. 
It is needed for African flatbreads and other applications. Bethany also sells 
various other Scandinavian cooking tools, for Lefse and other purposes. 
This unit was purchased on-line for 2021 US $135, and the lid for $38.<p></p> 

<p>Wass Electronics also sells a 16 inch Injera Grill (Mitad) that can be used 
the same as the Bethany Grill. including for Lefse. Because it is primarily 
sold for Injera and other African flatbreads it comes with a lid, and is rated 
for continuous use. Wass lists it at 2021 US $145, but I have seen it 
advertised at higher prices by 3rd party sellers.</p>

<p>Wass also sells a stovetop Injera Grill (out of stock in early 2021) that 
looks exactly like the Bethany bare aluminum griddle, but without the 
electric heating. They list it at 2021 US $89.</p>
