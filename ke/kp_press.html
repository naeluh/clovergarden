<h1>Pressure Cookers</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>Pressure Cookers can reduce cooking times for many foods, depending on the 
pressure they can maintain. 15 psi (pounds per square inch, 1 bar, 100 kPa) 
is the highest allowed, but at this pressure food can cook in as little as 
25% of the time taken in boiling water.</p>

<p>In 1950, 37% of U.S. households had a pressure cooker, but by 2011 that 
had dropped to 20%. Factors were fear of explosion (very unlikely today) and 
rise of the Microwave for quick cooking. It is, however, making a come-back 
in the form of <a href="kp_multi.html"><b>Multi-Cookers</b></a> like the 
"Instant Pot"&reg;.</p>

<p>In India, Pressure Cookers are very popular. Long cooking beans and similar 
foods are extremely important in South Asia, and fuel is scarce and expensive 
there. Many Indian recipes just presume you have one and say to cook "to 2 
whistles" or "to 3 whistles".</p>

<p><u>Whistles are no longer a valid measure</u>. They were based on every 
urban Indian home having the same two burner stove. Since economic liberation 
there are many kinds of stoves in use, and those hotter than the standard 
will need more whistles. Timing should be stated as minutes after the first 
whistle (full pressure).</p> 

<p>Brazilians, with another very bean oriented cuisine, consider a pressure 
cooker a household necessity.</p>

<p>The Pressure Cooker pictured here is made in India by Prestige, a brand 
very famous for cooking equipment there. They make them in 1.5 Liters to 20 
Liters and in aluminum, stainless steel, and stainless steel with induction 
bottoms, all available in North America. The one shown is a 6.5 Liter 
and sells for around 2020 US $67.25.</p>

<h3>Caution:</h3> &nbsp; Pressure Cookers are sized by full capacity in 
Liters or Quarts - but only 2/3 of that capacity can be used for food. 
Only 1/2 the capacity can be used for liquids or foods that foam, such 
as Rice, and only 1/3 the capacity for Beans Peas and Lentils, because 
they foam a lot.<p></p>

<h3>Material:</h3> &nbsp; Originally, most home Pressure Cookers were 
made of aluminum, but today stainless steel versions are available at 
similar prices. Aluminum is subject to corrosion, and acid foods have 
to be cooked in a non-reactive container, so we recommend stainless 
steel. If you have an induction range, stainless steel units with a 
magnetic bottom layer are available.<p></p>
<br>

<h3>Camping Pressure Cooker</h3>

<p><img src="img/kp_pressc02d.jpg" alt="Gsi Outdoors Pressure Cooker" class=mrg>
These are lightweight aluminum units, available in various sizes and 
designs. They are somewhat limited in maximum pressure, but are essential 
for folks camping at high altitudes, where water boils at so low a 
temperature cooking without pressure is impossible. Sherpas use cookers 
of this sort in their base camps in the Himalayas.The photo example by 
Gsi Outdoors weighs 4-1/2 pounds and holds 5.7 Liters, available for 
about 2020 US $48.71.</p>
