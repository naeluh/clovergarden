Puttu Makers are important in Sri Lanka and the South Indian states of 
Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and parts of Karnataka. They are used to make 
cylindrical cakes of ground grain mixed with freshly grated coconut and 
spices, particularly as a breakfast dish.

<p>Puttu Makers are a long tube fitted to a pot of boiling water. The 
original Puttu Maker was a length of bamboo, about 3 inches in diameter 
and a foot long, cut from just below a joint. A piece of perforated 
coconut shell would be fitted in it with the joint securing it. Today, 
they are usually made of aluminum or stainless steel, though clay ones 
are also made.</p>

<p>In Southern India, the grain is usually Rice, but in Sri Lanka it 
can be Wheat, Millet, Rice, or Tapioca, sometimes mixed with Urad Dal. 
The ratio of grain to coconut varies greatly, as do seasonings and 
optional ingredients. It is usually served with a curry.</p>
