<h2>Open V-Rack Roasting Pan</h2>
<p>This type of roasting pan is used for regular Wet Cured Hams (City Hams), 
Chickens, and supermarket Broad Breasted Turkeys. It is not so good for Free 
Range or Heritage Turkeys, or for Dry Cured Hams (Country Hams). For an 
example of how this type of roasting pan is used, see our recipe 
<a href="../ingred/turkeyroast.html"><b>Roasting A Turkey #1</b></a>.

<h2>Covered Roasting Pan</h2>
<p>This is the type of roasting pan you want for Heritage and Free Range 
Turkeys, and for Dry Cured Hams (Country Hams). It can be used also for 
supermarket Broad Breasted Turkeys and Wet Cured Hams (City Hams), but these 
days those are usually done in an open V-Rack roasting pan. For an example 
of how this type of roasting pan is used, see our recipe 
<a href="../ingred/turkeyroast2.html"><b>Roasting A Turkey #2</b></a>.

<p>Shown here is the classic Granite Ware roasting pan. It is quite superior 
to shiny stainless steel pans. These come in a variety of sizes. That shown 
is the 15 inch (about 2022 US $25), which can handle a 7 pound ham, and 
certainly a large chicken, or a duck, but for a medium turkey, you're going 
to want the 19 inch model (about 2022 US $40).
