<h1>Chinese Sand Pot</h1>
<img src="img/kp_cmsand07g.jpg" alt="Two Chinese Sand Pots" class=mrg>

<p>Used in both China and Vietnam, these pots are made of a special clay 
that has a sandy feel on the outside. The inside is usually glazed. They 
are made in a number of sizes and shapes.</p>

<p>&Uuml;ber expert Paula Wolfert recommends these for Mediterranean clay 
pot cooking, because they are so much less expensive than European clay pots 
- but these are becoming scarce due to Communist central planning favoring 
stainless and aluminum.</p>

<h2 id=caut>Cautions</h2>
<ul>
<li>These pots are intended for oven or open flame. If used on an electric 
  stove a heat defuser must be used on the burner.</li>
<li>Use moderate to low heat for all cooking.</li>
<li>Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Never set a hot pot on a cold 
  surface. It can be set on a folded towel, or on wood.</li>
<li> Never put the pot in a preheated oven. place in a cold oven so it 
  can come up to temperature gradually.</li>
<li>Do not use soap or detergent to clean, it can get into pores and 
  taint food.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="seas">Seasoning Indian Clay Pots</h2>

<ul>
<li>Soak in water 8 hrs or overnight.</li>
<li>Wipe clean with a scouring sponge.</li>
<li>Set in the Sun until completely dry.</li>
<li>Fill with water and and 1 cup cooked rice (2 cups for a big pot).</li>
<li>Wipe the bottom of the pot and place on a cold burner grate. Turn 
  heat to low until water is warm, then up to moderate to bring rice water 
  to a boil. Turn again to low and leave it at a bare simmer for a couple 
  of hours. Let cool completely, then discard rice and water.</li>
<li>Clean well with a damp sponge - no soap or detergent - they can get into 
  the pores and harm food flavors.</li>
<li><b>Before each use:</b> &nbsp; give it a soak in water for 15 minutes 
  or so.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="crack">Hairline Cracks</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Re-season as above.</li>
<li>Paula Wolfert says she has had great success filling 
a sand pot with milk and bringing it to a simmer for awhile.</li>
</ul>
