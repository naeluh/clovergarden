<h1>stainless Steel <small>&amp;</small> Multi-Ply</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>>Until the turn of the century (the 1999/2000 one), stainless 
steel cookware was to be avoided. Stainless (nickel / iron alloys) has 
very poor heat conductivity and the pans were thin because stainless is 
difficult to form. They were prone to nasty hot spots - fine for boiling 
water but not for much else.</p>
<p>That changed when All Clad perfected a way to sandwich 
incompatible metals, first with explosives, then with a high temperature 
roller press. Thin sheets of stainless with a core of aluminum or copper 
solved both the heat distribution problems of stainless and the toxicity 
problems of aluminum and copper. </p>

<h2 id="gen" class=lrg>General <small>&amp;</small> Selection</h2>

<p>Plain stainless is simply out of the picture today except for large 
stock pots where the ingredients will always be pretty much suspended in 
water, and for things like roasting pans where material is not particularly 
important.</p>

<p>Note that Stainless Steel comes in two general varieties - high nickel 
and high iron. If a magnet sticks to it, it's high iron, which is less 
corrosion resistant than high nickel. On the other hand, high iron is the 
only kind that will work on an induction range. Most multiplys are made 
with high nickel on the inside and high iron on the outside so they can 
be used on these ranges.</p>

<p>Multi-ply cookware is made in two designs:
<ul>
<li><b>Slab bottom:</b> &nbsp;  a plain stainless vessel with an 
aluminum slab welded to the bottom, usually with an outer stainless 
layer.</li>
<li><b>FullyClad:</b> &nbsp; Here the vessel is pressed from a multi-ply 
sheet, so the cross section is the same for the entire pan.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen plenty of comparative reviews of saut&eacute; pans saying 
both designs work just fine - but they don't. Reviewers must fear a 
cut-off of free samples from manufacturers if they tell the truth. 
Slab bottom saut&eacute; pans have a very hot ring at the edge of the 
slab, making even frying of onions difficult - <u>however</u> - a 
5-1/2 quart saut&eacute; is so much bigger than the burner this is not 
a problem (and the slab bottom is a <u>lot</u> less expensive in that 
size).</p>

<h2 id="slab">Slab Bottom Stainless</h2>

<p>Slab bottom pans are excellent for stew pots, stock pots and larger 
sauce pans where the bottom of the pan is much wider than the burner and 
the contents will always be pretty liquid.</p>

<p>
<img src="img/kp_sslab02e.jpg" alt="Slab Bottom cheap" class=mrg>
<img src="img/kp_sslab03e.jpg" alt="Slab Bottom better" class=mrg>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>The photo on the left above shows the construction of a cheaper pan 
with the edge of the aluminum slab exposed and ending quite far from the 
edge of the pan. The stainless bottom is very thin, but that isn't a 
problem. Despite it being a cheap pan, this 3 quart saucepan has given 
years of satisfactory service, because it is large and only been used 
with liquids and never for serious frying.</p>

<p>The photo on the right shows a more expensive construction (Cuisinart) 
with a thicker aluminum slab ending closer to the edge and completely 
encapsulated in stainless. This is a 2 quart saut&eacute; pan and it does 
exhibit a hot ring around the outside edge when frying, particularly 
noticeable with chopped onions. Generally the pan is quite usable, but 
takes extra care with stirring. A cheaper model made like the sauce pot 
in the previous paragraph might be a lot worse.</p>

<p>Slab bottom is not very good for smaller pans and particularly not good 
for saut&eacute; pans or skillets. I had a cheaper 1.5 quart sauce pan 
which was usable with liquids, but the handle was so heavy compared to 
the pan itself it tended to do a back flip off the stove if it didn't 
have much in it. It had to be replaced with a heavier Cuisinart fully 
clad model for safety.</p>

<p>Note that my 5-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan is a good quality slab 
bottom (Cuisinart), and it works just fine. It's so much bigger than 
the burner the hot edge problem does not appear.</p>

<h2 id="clad">Fully Clad Multi-Ply</h2>

<p>Fully clad pans are excellent as saut&eacute; pans, skillets and 
small pans. Chopped onions will brown much more evenly in such a pan than 
in a slab bottom pan but they are significantly more expensive.</p>

<p>
<img src="img/kp_ssclad03e.jpg" alt="Fully clad pan" class=mrg>
<img src="img/kp_ssclad02e.jpg" alt="Cross Section" class=mrg>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>The photo to the left shows the corner of a fully clad pan. It is a 
smooth curve from bottom to side and the pan is the same thickness at all 
points. The photo to the right shows the cross section, two very thin 
sheets of stainless with a thicker aluminum layer in between. Some pans 
have an inside ply of non-reactive 18/10 (alloy 316) stainless while the 
outside ply is a less corrosion resistant magnetic stainless so the pans 
will work on induction ranges.</p>

<p>The fully clad design is not as good as the slab for large stew or 
stock pots where the bottom is much wider than the burner and the 
contents are more liquid. The aluminum layer of a fully clad pan is quite 
thin compared to a slab and has more limited heat spreading capacity. 
This can result in the center of the bottom getting too hot - 
particularly noticeable with soups containing barley, and thick stews.
</p>

<p>Some of the top names in fully clad cookware even make fully clad 
roasting pans. For roasting a turkey that's a total waste of money - but 
profitable for the manufacturer, if they can get people to buy them.</p>


<h2 id="plain">Plain Stainless</h2>

<p><img src="img/kp_ss20qt06e.jpg" alt="Stock Pot" class=mrg>
Plain stainless once sold pretty well. It didn't dissolve in the food 
like aluminum, cost a lot less than enameled iron and was a lot lighter 
than either enameled or bare iron and didn't chip and rust through like 
enameled steel. The only problem was, it burned the food. Stainless steel 
has rather poor heat conductivity, so where it contacts flame or burner it 
gets plenty hot, and the heat doesn't spread out to cooler regions fast 
enough.</p>

<p><b>Revere Ware</b> was an attempt to make stainless steel cook 
decently. It featured a thick electroplating of copper on the bottom, 
wrapping part way up the side. Revere Ware is still sold, but in 1968 
they cut the thickness of the copper by nearly 50%, pretty much 
destroying its cooking properties. It's probably even thinner today. 
"Revere Ware" is now owned by World Kitchen, an accumulator of famous 
but distressed brand names.</p>

<p>Plain stainless is fine for roasting pans where the material makes 
little difference, and for restaurant size stock pots where the contents 
will always be very liquid. The photo shows my 20 quart stainless stock 
pot and it's basket insert (which is not stainless but chrome plated 
steel). I also have a matching 12 quart which is used to finish stews 
that have grown too large for my 8-quart slab bottom pot. If there is 
danger of things sticking to the bottom, I slide my steel comal under 
it to help spread the heat.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Typical Pans</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="sauce">Multi-Ply Sauce Pans</h2>
<br><img src="img/kp_ssauce04e.jpg" alt="Sauce Pans" class=mrg>
Sauce pans are the workhorses of every kitchen, and multi-ply construction 
is excellent for these pans. Smaller pans should be fully clad, but 3 
quarts and up can be slab bottom.
<p>Those shown in the photo are the ones I use, and at least one of them 
is used every day. Lower left is a 1 quart Windsor and the upper right 
is a 2 quart Windsor. Windsor pans have sloping sides which makes whisking 
easier. That it's for more surface area for reducing sauces makes no 
sense, the reduction comes from bubbling steam off the bottom. Lower 
right is a 1.5 quart standard straight sided sauce pan. Upper left is a 
3 quart no-name slab bottom sauce pan fitted with a steamer pan. All the 
other pans are Cuisinart fully clad.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Steamer Pan</h2>
<br><img src="img/kp_ssteam01k.jpg" alt="Steamer Pan" class=mrg>
This is a kitchen essential for cooking vegetables and some seafood - a 
steamer pan that fits on the top of one or more of your sauce pans. This 
Cuisinart pan is stepped so it fits several sizes of sauce pan, but I 
always use it with the 3 quart, the largest it fits. It's plain single 
ply stainless and I don't think anyone makes any other kind because that 
would be absurd.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Multi-Ply Saut&eacute; Pans</h2>
<br><img src="img/kp_ss3-5saut01k.jpg" alt="Saut&eacute; Pan" class=mrg>
Saut&eacute; pans are not as good for saut&eacute;ing (verb) as a skillet, 
but they are perfect for saut&eacute;s (noun). Unless you are strictly a 
meat and potatoes person (and if you are, you probably wouldn't be reading 
this site) at least one of these is a kitchen essential. Saut&eacute; pans 
should be fully clad if at all possible, to avoid a hot ring around the 
edge.
<p>I have three of these: a 2 quart, a 3-1/2 quart and a 5 quart. The 
5 quart is slab bottom, but is so much bigger than the burner it works 
fine for what I use it for, and at that size cost is a major issue. The 
3-1/2 quart is the one that gets used constantly, the 2 quart less often 
(and often to stand in for an already occupied sauce pan), and the 5 
quart is the party workhorse.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Multi-Ply Wok</h2>
<br><img src="img/kp_wok01h.jpg" alt="Wok" class=mrg>
The photo is of my 13 inch Calphalon wok. It gets a lot of use, depending 
on what cuisines I am doing at the time. It is not quite as temperature 
responsive as a sheet steel wok, but much more so than a cast iron wok and 
it's easier to clean than either. I recommend it highly - but you need to 
get a wok lid and steamer rack for it too. Aside from Chinese cuisine, 
use a wok whenever you cook greens that will start bulky and wilt down.
<p>At 13 inches this one is as small as is practical for a wok. Having a 
small flat at the bottom, it rests directly on burners for excellent 
heating, but the flat part is not large enough to interfere with regular 
wok function. Not needing a ring stand is a great convenience.</p>
<p>All Clad has a 14 inch one that sells for about 2015 US $199, which 
is over $100 more than the Calphalon. At that price, I'm perfectly 
willing to use my excellent Atlas 14 inch spin formed sheet steel wok 
and a ring stand. All Clad calls theirs an "Open Stir Fry Pan" because 
of the rather large flat area at the bottom. I prefer the small flat.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Slab Bottom Stock Pot</h2>
<br><img src="img/kp_s8stock01h.jpg" alt="Stock Pot" class=mrg>
For making stock, almost any material will work fine, though I recommend 
strongly against bare steel unless the pot is used constantly, as in a 
restaurant. On the other hand, I make large amounts of soups and stews, 
and there the thick aluminum slab on the bottom is highly desirable.
<p>I have a 5 quart no-name and an 8 quart Cuisinart, both of which are 
used very often. If you routinely cook for a bunch of people a 12 quart 
would be a good idea, As mentioned above I have a 12 quart and a 20 quart 
in plain stainless.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="maint" class=lrg>Care <small>&amp;</small> Maintenance</h2>

<p>Stainless and multi-ply cookware needs very little maintenance. Some 
pieces do pick up a bit of mineral deposits from the water and should be 
cleaned with hot vinegar now and then, particularly a wok because mineral 
deposits can cause stuff to stick to it.</p>
<p>Do not fear to clean this cookware with a kitchen cleanser like Comet 
but do not use abrasive pads or steel wool.</p>

<p>Other than that - just don't over-heat it. Temperatures should be kept 
down around 450&deg;F/230&deg;C. At temperatures much higher than that you 
risk delamination of the metal layers. If there's ginger in a badly 
burned pan it'll eat big pits into the stainless.</p>
