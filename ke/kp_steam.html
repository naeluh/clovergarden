<h2>Stainless Steel Steamer</h2>
<p>Chinese cuisines make frequent use of multilevel steamers. The one in 
the photo is actually 2 levels as there is a steamer tray fitted into 
the lower pot. An advantage of this type over the traditional bamboo steamer 
is that it doesn't tie up you wok while steaming. This type steamer is also 
available in 3 and 4 level versions with multiples of the upper tray.</p>

<h2>Bamboo Steamer - Traditional</h2>
<p>This is the traditional Chinese steamer, designed to be set into a wok 
which heats the water. They are still made and available in various sizes. 
10 inch seems the most common in North America, but the Wok Shop has them 
in 6 inches to 20 inches. These work fine and are popular, but a little 
more difficult to clean than stainless steel.

<h2>Wok Steamer Set</h2>
<p>A wok with a steamer grate can steam items too wide to fit in a normal 
steamer. In particular, this set is used with an oval plate to steam 
whole fish, a very popular method in China. Some water condenses in the 
dish and absorbs other ingredients to make the sauce. For an example see 
our recipe <a href="../recipes/cmf_fishsteam1.html"><b>Steamed Fish - 
Chinese Style</b></a>.

<h2>Steamer Pan - Western</h2>
<p>This very convenient steamer pan is stepped so it fits various saucepans 
where the water is boiled. It comes with its own lid. This example is 8-1/4 
inches diameter. The flat bottom is 6 inches diameter, the size of the 
smallest saucepan it will fit.

<h2>Steamer Basket - Expandable</h2>
<p>This is a common item in North America. It fits pans from 6 inches to 9 
inches, and folds up tightly for storage. Disadvantage are that the central 
pillar is sometimes in the way. and it's much harder to clean than most 
steamers.
