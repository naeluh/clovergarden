<span class=bg>Nearly all our food needs to be cooked, and two thirds of the worlds 
population don't have ovens, so stovetop cookware comes right after knives 
in importance. Once it was really simple, you had only a few options. Today 
we have thousands of options. Which to chose?</span>

<h2 id="gen">General &amp; History</h2>

<p>Fire was not tamed by humans, but by some of our pre-human ancestors 
in Africa - it is a skill we inherited from them. Cooking is extremely 
important. Paleo-antropologists now think it was cooked food that allowed 
our distant ancestors to develope large, energy consuming brains. We 
have been cooking food so long our digestive tract is no longer well 
adapted to a raw food diet - despite what some raw food enthusiasts 
claim (many of whom are dangerously thin).<p>
<p>Plant foods are very difficult to digest uncooked, and a great many 
are toxic - until cooked. Not only do our simian relatives have 
restricted food options, many have to spend as much as 8 hours a day just 
chewing to make plant foods digestible. Meats are difficult to catch in 
the wild, and may then contain various parisites and diseases that can 
only be rendered safe by cooking.</p>
<p>Our first ovens were pits filled with red hot rocks and covered over 
with wet leaves and soil. Cooking time could be a day or more. Our first 
"stovetop" cooking was done in hollowed out logs. How do you make soups 
and stews in a hollowed out log? You partially fill it with water and 
food, then toss in a number of those same red hot rocks to bring it to 
a boil. Soup will be ready in an hour or so. This was much more 
convenient than the pit oven. These logs were eventually replaced by 
clay cauldrons set over hot coals, then bronze cauldrons, and finally 
iron cauldrons.</p>
<p>Some foods, like flat breads and strips of meat, could be cooked 
directly on flat rocks that had been heated in a fire until nearly red 
hot - the predecessor of our frying pans, skilets, tavas and comals.</p>
<p>Today, our kitchens are not well adapted to producing red hot rocks, 
and nor are they even well adapted to cauldrons, but we have a wide and 
sometimes confusing array of stovetop cooking devices more efficient 
even than the cauldron and flat rocks.</p>
