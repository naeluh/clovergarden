<h1>Tava / Griddle Pan</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>In India, the slightly concave Tava (right in photo) is used for toasting 
chapatis and similar tasks. The photo one is <u>not traditional</u>, because 
traditionally the Tava has no handle, and is maneuvered with special kitchen 
tongs called pakkad.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend the Lodge 90G 10-1/2 inch (26.6 cm) Griddle Pan 
(left in photo. It will toast chapatis just fine, but has another very 
important use. In India, Africa, and elsewhere, spices are very often dry 
toasted before grinding, and this pan, with its low rim, is perfect for 
that job. It will also serve fine as a Mexican Comal for toasting tortillas.
