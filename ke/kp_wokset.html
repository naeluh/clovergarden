<h1>Wok Set</h1>
<br><img src="img/kp_wokset18g.jpg" alt="Wok, Tools, and Accessories" class=mrg>
This pan and set of tools and accessories is pretty much essential for any 
approach to any of the many Chinese cuisines. Woks are fine for other cuisines 
as well, especially Korean, Japanese, and Southeast Asian. Also anywhere a 
whole pile of greens are added and stirred in to wilt down, or if cooking 
with the minimum amount of oil is desired. 

<p>Included in the Wok Set are:
<br>&curren; &nbsp; The <b>Wok</b> itself. This one is a 13 inches (33 cm), 
which is about the smallest that is truly effective. The most common size is 
14 inches (35.6 cm). 
<br>&curren; &nbsp; The <b>Wok Lid</b>. Essential for steaming and keeping 
things warm.
<br>&curren; &nbsp; The <b>Wok Ring</b>. Western stoves are not fitted for 
woks, so a Wok Ring (top right) is needed for round bottomed woks. The one 
shown is of wire, with cuts to make if fit tightly on the stove grid.
<br>&curren; &nbsp; The <b>Wok Shovel</b>.  This is the main tool for stir 
frying and otherwise manipulating foods in the Wok.
<br>&curren; &nbsp; A <b>Spider Skimmer</b>. This will lift things out of 
oil taking the minimum amount of oil with it. It can also lift things out of 
water.
<br>&curren; &nbsp; <b>Draining Rack</b>. This, clinging to the upper right 
rim of the Wok, is for receiving deep fried foods and letting them drain back 
into the Wok.
<br>&curren; &nbsp; The <b>Steamer Rack</b> is seen in the bottom of the 
Wok. It can support plates or other containers for steaming foods too wide 
to fit in a regular steamer.

<h2>The Wok</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Chinese Wok:</h3> &nbsp; This is the wok geometry we are familiar with. 
it is a relatively shallow bowl shape which allows pushing things a ways 
up the sides to clear the center.<p></p>

<h3>Japanese Wok:</h3> &nbsp; This wok has more the geometry of an indian 
<a href="kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, with high sides, and often 
an even tighter radius. This wok can handle a lot of ingredients, and is 
good for stews and the like, but less suitable for general stir frying.
<p></p>

<h3>Size, Shape:</h3> &nbsp; The standard wok size in North America is 14 
inches (35.6 cm); For my use, cooking for 1 to 3 persons, I find a 13 inch 
(33 cm) is adequate, but anything smaller would be quite limited.  For 
Western stoves it is best to have a flat bottomed wok, but the flat should 
not be more than 5 inches (13 cm), or the wok will not work properly. I'm fine 
with a round bottom wok because I have a wire ring cut so the wok is barely 
above the gas flame, but a round bottom won't work on an electric stove or 
at all on an induction stove.<p></p>

<h2>Temperatures:</h2>

<p>Wok cooking is by nature high temperature, at least for parts of the 
cooking. Many cookbooks give descriptions of steps without realizing they 
won't work quite that way in our homes - their recipes are developed on 
restaurant stoves, which are about 20 times as hot.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Wok Hei</i> flavor, characteristic of Cantonese restaurant 
cooking, uses extreme heat and high flames combined with special techiques 
by highly trained cooks - totally impossible on a home stove. J. Kenji 
L&oacute;pez-Alt, in his book <i>The Wok</i>, presents a method using a 
powerful <a href="ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>. The food is 
poured out onto a baking sheet, singed with the torch, then poured back into 
the wok for finishing.</p> 

<h2>Material:</h2> &nbsp; Woks are made of various metals, some more suitable 
than others. 
<ul>
<li><h3>Sheet Steel:</h3> &nbsp; This is the go-to wok for serious wok 
enthusiasts and is the standard in Guangzhou (Canton) where the folks are 
extreme wok fanatics. These are light weight for easy manipulation, respond 
very quickly to temperature changes, withstand the fiercest flames, and are 
nearly indestructible. In the home, they do take attention for seasoning, 
cleaning and preventing rust. 

<p>Sheet steel woks may be formed by pressing, and will be completely smooth, 
or by spinning, which will usually leave a light, closely spaced ring pattern 
on the surface of the steel. These are considered superior because the texture 
helps hold ingredients that are pushed up the side to clear the center, and 
tend to be thicker gage steel than pressed woks. My 14 inch spun steel wok by 
Atlas Metal Spinning is top quality, but no longer made.</p></li>

<li><h3>Cast Iron:</h3> &nbsp; I have a Japanese cast iron wok, but never use 
it. It is much less responsive to heat changes than even my Calphalon tri-ply 
wok, and takes a long time to heat up. Cast iron woks are a prestige item in 
Guangzhou (Canton), but theirs are practically egg shell thin, and very  
fragile, so a backup is needed in case they get hit and shatter.<p></p>

<li><h3>Tri-ply Stainless:</h3> &nbsp; I admit - the wok I routinely use 
is a 13 inch Calphalon tri-ply (in photo above). I am not a wok fanatic, so 
I get along fine with this for most uses. It is sufficiently responsive to 
temperature changes, is very easy to clean, and requires minimum care. It is 
particularly good for long braises as it is non corrosive. It is possible 
it can come unlaminated at Guangzhou temperatures, but my home stove can't 
get anywhere near that hot. Most of these (if they have a flat bottom) will 
work on an induction range because, the outside layer will be a magnetic 
alloy.

<p><u>Caution</u>: don't use a stainless wok for deep frying. It will be 
quickly coated with varnish that is very difficult to remove, and will look 
ugly. Use a sheet steel wok which is supposed to be covered with varnish.
I actually use an Indian sheet steel <a href="kp_kadhaiz.html">
<b>Kadhai</b></a> for deep frying. It looks a lot like a wok, but it's 
geometry is optimized for deep frying.</p></li>

<li><h3>Non-stick Woks:</h3> &nbsp; These are to be avoided, because proper 
wok usage involves temperatures that will destroy most non-stick coatings, 
releasing toxic fumes.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg>Accessories</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Wok Lid:</h3> &nbsp; Some woks come with a lid. For others, they are 
available from a well stocked Asian market, or on-line. The one I use with 
my 13 inch wok is 12-1/4 inches diameter (31 cm - probably sold as 30 cm) 
stainless steel. For a 14 inch wok they are about 13.6 inches (35 cm) 
diameter.<p></p>

<h3>Wok Ring:</h3> &nbsp; Woks like the Calphalon in the photo at top have 
a small flat at the center, so doesn't need a Wok Ring, but round bottomed 
woks and Kadhais do. I prefer a wire type as it allows better heat flow, 
and can be cut to fit the burner tightly. I also have a regular aluminum 
one I set out of the way on the kitchen floor so I can get a hot wok or 
kadhai off the stove when needed.<p></p>

<h3>Wok Shovel:</h3> &nbsp; Use wooden shovels for tri-ply or nonstick 
woks. For sheet steel and cast iron woks, a metal shovel is standard, but 
a wooden one can still be used. The shovel is an essential item for stir 
frying.<p></p>

<h3>Spider Skimmer:</h3> &nbsp; This device is used when deep frying in a 
wok or kadhai. It will take far less oil with it than a slotted spatula or 
spoon. The traditional Chinese spider skimmer has a woven, lace-like mesh, 
but this is much harder to clean than simple wire circles.<p></p>

<h3>Draining Rack:</h3> &nbsp; These must be exactly the right size for 
your wok. I actually don't use this item, because if I've gone to the 
trouble to do deep frying, I'm usually doing a lot, so I use a larger 
external wire basket lined with paper towels.<p></p>

<h3>Steamer Rack:</h3> &nbsp; This device is used to support plates or 
other containers for steaming, especially an oval plate for steaming 
whole fish. For an example, see our recipe 
<a href="../recipes/cmf_fishsteam1.html"><b>Steamed Fish - Chinese 
Style</b></a>.<p></p>
