<h1>Mortar <small>&amp;</small> Pestle - <small>&amp;</small> 
Grinding Stones</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<span class=bg>Most ethnic cuisines make very heavy use of a large mortar 
and pestle. Mercifully this has been largely replaced by the food 
processor and spice grinder - but not entirely. There are still many 
things that work much better or much more conveniently in a mortar 
(easy cllean-up, for one thing) - so it is an essential kitchen tool.

<h2 id="var" class=lrg>Types of Mortar &amp; Pestle</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Thai Green Granite Mortar</h2>
<br><img src="https://clovegarden.com/ke/img/ke_mortar12k.jpg" alt="Thai Green Granite Mortar & Pestle" class=mrg>
<p>
Back before the Wall Street Journal was bought by Murdock and turned into 
a propaganda rag for the 1%, it had articles relevant to real people. 
They even occasionally had comparative reviews of kitchen equipment. The 
reviewers, however, were a bit weak in the wrists, to the extent they 
marked down the wonderful Oxo salad spinner for not being motorized.
</p>
<p>So then, why in the world did these wimpy reviewers select as 
"Number 1" this 11 pound green granite Thai monster mortar with its 
massive 3 pound pestle?  Could it be just because it was the only one 
in their test suite that worked? Others were found much less effective, 
but "innovative" and  "gourmet" models performed particularly poorly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I already had a Thai mortar, having come to the same 
conclusion years ahead of them. The bowl is 5-1/2 inches inside and 4 
inches deep, holding 6 cups (1-1/2 quarts).</p>
<p>One Thai chef reports having flown to America with his granite mortar 
on his lap the whole way to make sure it didn't get lost. A teacher of 
Thai cooking reports her students rush out after their first class to buy 
their own. But it's not just for Thai cuisine, it works just as well 
for just about every other cuisine in the world.
<br class=cll></p>


<h2>Marble Mortar &amp; Pestle</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_mortar15c.jpg" alt="Marble Mortar &amp; Pestle" class=mrg>
<p>
This is the minimum mortar that's really useful. It weighs a mere 5 pounds 
5 ounces with a bowl 3-3/4 inches wide and 2-3/4 inches deep holding 2 cups. 
Trouble is, the pestle that comes with many of these is laughably inadequate 
and no amount of blue pills will help. I had a sufficient stoneware pestle 
made by a local ceramicist.</p>
<p>A mortar in this class is a kitchen essential for any cuisine. Mine sits 
on the window sill over my kitchen counter, ready for instant use for minor 
grinding and smashing tasks not sufficiently demanding to require the Thai 
monster. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3 id="kruk">Kruk</h3>
<br><img src="img/ke_kruk02k.jpg" alt="Kruk Mortar &amp; Pestel" class=mrg>
[Kruk, Kluek (Thai); Cloke &amp; Sok (Laos)] 
<p>
This fired clay mortar with it's wooden pestle is used in Issan 
(northeastern Thailand) and Laos to make the famous Green Papaya Salad 
and similar preparations. It is used very differently from the Thai 
granite mortar. Strips of green papaya, long beans and other vegetables 
are lightly bruised so they absorb dressing but are still fairly crisp 
and intact. A special technique is used. The pestle strikes at an angle 
near the top of the contents so the bruising can be precisely controled. 
A spoon is used to continuously bring ingredients up from the bottom 
to where the pestle strikes.</p>
<p>These are inexpensive in Asian markets here in Los Angeles. The photo 
specimen, 6-3/4 inches across the opening and 7 inches deep, cost 2016 
US $12, including the pestle, traditionally made of palm wood.  It is a 
little large for a modest size salad, so I also have one about 6-1/4 
inches across the opening and 6 inches deep, which cost $11. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Molcajete &amp; Tejolote</h3> 
<br><img src="img/ke_molja02k.jpg" alt="Molcajete &amp; Tejolote" class=mrg>
<p>
Made from gray volcanic stone, this Mexican mortar and pestle is often 
used to make salsas, for which its coarse texture is a great advantage. 
It's probably a little too coarse for some mortar and pestle tasks in 
other cuisines. The photo specimen has a bowl 6 inches wide and 2-1/2 
inches deep. The bowl weighs 7 pounds and the peltel weighs 1-1/4 pounds. 
The bowl holds 3-1/2 cups of liquid. Note that the stone is so porous 
water will slowly seep through it, but generally only solids or 
semi-solids will be ground in it. Best to clean it with a stiff bristle 
brush to remove stuff from the pores. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Africa</h3>
<br><img src="img/ym_fufuy01k.jpg" alt="African Mortar in use" class=mrg>
<p>
In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, mashes (fufu) are the main dish, as rice 
is in Asia. These mashes need to be made in large quantity, so a very 
large mortar made from a tree trunk, preferably a mango tree, is used. 
It is operated standing up, using a very long pestle, often by two 
people, each with a pestle.

<h2 id="use">Using a Mortar &amp; pestle</h2>

<p>I recently read advice in a food article saying, "don't pound with the 
pestle, use a circular motion". Yeah, right. If you're doing much more than 
grinding a few peppercorns that's going to make a wreck of your wrist in 
short order.</p>
<p>Pounding in a mortar is so important in some cultures that a young 
woman's readiness for marriage is judged by the pace and rhythm of her 
pounding.</p>

<ul>
<li>When doing serious pounding you should place the base of your mortar 
on a shock absorbing pad. A folded towel or potholder will do. This will 
prevent cracks in your counters and things being shaken down.</li>
<li>Pound relatively small amounts at a time, this will get the job done 
faster.</li>
<li>When making pastes, start with the toughest ingredients, adding the 
next ingredient when the desired texture has been achieved. Finish with 
sticky ingredients like garlic.</li>
<li>When making pastes, always chop ingredients as fine as you can before 
adding them to the mortar. This saves a lot of time and work.</li>
<li>Mortar and pestle work is best assigned to the males of the household, 
who, besides being stronger, are well practiced in the appropriate stroke 
and rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metate y Mano</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Licuadora Azteca (Aztec Blender)]
<br><img src="img/ke_metate02k.jpg" alt="Metate, Mano" class=mrg>
<p>
Unlike the Mortar &amp; Pestle, the Metate y Mano can be used to grind 
relatively large amounts of seeds into flour. This device has been used in 
various forms worldwide since the far depths of prehistory. In Mexico it's 
still used in the villages to grind corn into flour, as well as grinding 
chilis, cacao and other ingredients for mole (sauces). It is not generally 
needed in our kitchens because flour can be purchased ready ground and most 
other sauce ingredients can be ground in a food processor and/or spice 
grinder. A very similar device, the <b>Sil and Batta</b>, is used in India for 
similar purposes, but the "mano" is flat and triangular in shape.

<h3>Stone Mill</h3>
<br><img src="img/ke_millstone01k.jpg" alt="Stone Mill" class=mrg>
<p>
Millstones were introduced to China through trade with the Roman Empire, 
raising the status of wheat from despised grain to a favorite of the 
Imperial Court. Small hand mills are still made in China, used mostly for 
grinding grains, seeds and beans for dessert pastes. The mill in the photo 
is occasionally available from <a href="http://www.wokshop.com">The Wok 
Shop</a> in San Francisco. Very similar but larger mills called 
<b>Chakki</b> are used in India by women who go from door to door 
grinding a week's spices for households. &nbsp; <small>
