Why is this device an "essential"? Because you can't make a decent 
salad without one. Dressings adhere well to dry greens, not at all to wet 
greens. They are also great for spinning various small vegetables after 
washing and especially for drying spinach after the necessary float wash.

<p>Fortunately those horrid things from France with toy top mechanisms 
or chains with which to swing them around are no longer to be seen. We 
now have a choice of spinners that actually work.

<p>There are many brands and sizes of salad spinner other than the two shown 
here, but these are the market leaders. I have no experience with any of the 
others.</p>

<h2>Oxo Salad Spinner</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_sspin02h.jpg" alt="Salad Spinner" class=mrg>
Far and away the market leader in salad spinners, the Oxo features a plunger 
action which can be operated with one hand. Both the bowl and basket can be used 
separately from each other and the lid. Mine, in the photo, is an older model, 
the current one (2022) has a transparent lid. There is also a "Small Salad 
and Herb" model - cute, but I see no need for it. You can dry one sprig of 
parsley in the big one if you feel the need.
<p>Clearly this is the spinner to beat - and nobody's beating it. On Amazon 
this spinner has 21,894 reviews with a 4-1/2 star rating (out of 5). I have used 
mine for years and have never been less than fully satisfied with its 
performance. Models have changed, but the basic action is exactly the same.

<h2>Zyliss Salad Spinner</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_sszylis02h.jpg" alt="Salad Spinner" class=mrg>
People who don't like the Oxo seem to love the Zyliss. This 
spinner features a pull cord action which takes both hands to operate. 
Zyliss has added one with a pump handle that works very differently from 
the Oxo pump.
