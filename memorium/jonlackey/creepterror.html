<p><span class=bg>This is a subsidiary page to the 
<a href="jonlackey.html"><b>Jon Lackey</b></a> memorial page. It 
involves Jon's design and construction of a monster for the 
horror-science fiction film <b><i>The Creeping Terror</i></b>. This 
film, starring Vic Savage, and directed by Vic Savage under the name 
A. J. Nelson, has gone down in history as one of the worst films of 
all time. I had no part in the making of Jon's monster, but did 
participate in important subsequent events.

This monster was built by Jon Lackey on a floor of the abandoned 
Masonic Temple in Glendale, California. It was made of plastic foam - 
mostly foamed in place, and fabric, over a chicken wire frame. Jon 
had no money, so it was financed by the film producers. I witnessed 
the monster in situ during the construction phase.</p>

<p>Jon built the structure of this monster so it could only be operated 
by a person of his tall, slender stature. He insisted that he, and he 
alone, would operate it during filming, and that he would get screen 
credits. The film's producers rejected his demands, possibly for legal 
or union reasons, and insisted the monster be modified to accommodate 
persons of lesser stature and greater girth.<p>

<p>This put Jon in a real huff, and he decided to confiscate the monster 
and hold it for ransom until his demands were met. He considered it 
entirely his property, though it had been financed by the film's 
producers, who also supported him during its construction - thus a "work 
for hire" and copyright to the producers. Whether Jon held the 
copyright to the drawing on this page, or whether it too was a "work for 
hire", is unknown to me.</p>

<p>I know these events to be true, as I was a member of the crew Jon 
recruited to "move the monster", in the dark of night, to parts unknown. 
Jon didn't tell us he was stealing it, but seeing his considerable 
delight in its being moved, we had our suspicions even at the time.</p>

<p>By this time, the film producers had enough of Jon, and the monster 
was rebuilt by someone more cooperative. That is why the credit (see 
top of page) is for "Monster Design" only. The replacement wasn't as 
good as Jon's monster, but for this film, does it matter?</p>

<p>The word got around about how difficult Jon was to work with, and 
that was the end of Jon's career in film. The final credit in this one 
release is his lifetime achievement. The film itself was awarded an entry 
in Wikipedia's  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_worst">
<b>List of films considered the worst</b></a>. Alas, there is no mention 
of Jon Lackey on that page, or on Wikipedia's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creeping_Terror"><b>The 
Creeping Terror</b></a> page.</p>

<p>The materials the monster was made of were very unstable, and it 
quickly disintegrated. Jon probably had photos, but they are now lost.
