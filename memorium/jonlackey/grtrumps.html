<p><span class=bg>This is a subsidiary page to the 
<a href="jonlackey.html"><b>Jon Lackey</b></a> memorial page. It 
revolves around production of a play with music and dance, all based 
on Charles Williams novel <i>The Greater Trumps</i>. This was put on 
by the Mythopoeic Society with Jon Lackey directing, and members of 
the Society doing most of the work and the performance. My involvement 
was peripheral.

<p>This play was a complex and demanding project. Members of the 
Mythopoeic Society rehearsed for over a month. Music for the dance 
was composed, performed and recorded to tape by the members. I was 
not a member of the Mythopoeic Society**, but was a friend of Jon's 
who had some technical abilities.</p>

<p>My part in the public performance was to man the tape recorder and 
stop and start the music for the dance section. I had attended all the 
rehearsals and the recording sessions, so I knew my cues.</p>

<p>Jon was rushing about setting things up. He was clearly exhausted, 
flying high on massive amounts of tea, as he often was. You can't be 
at your best under these circumstances.</p>

<p>I placed the tape recorder well back behind the stage, but Jon 
was not pleased. He said the clunking of the tape recorder could be 
heard. He scooted it so far back I could barely hear what was 
happening on the stage.</p>

<p>During the performance, I was sure I heard my cue for the music and 
started the tape. Jon rushed back yelling at me that it wasn't the 
right time. I was right, Jon was wrong. He took control of the tape 
machine, and chaos ensued.</p>

<p>After the event, I asked Jon to lend me the tape so I could make 
copies of the music to share with the performers. He angrily refused. 
The tape was <u>his</u>. The music was <u>his</u>, the play was 
<u>his</u>. He had hidden the tape away. He probably blamed me for 
the miscue, Jon could never admit to such an error on his part.</p>

<p>So, the music composed and performed for this event, by members of 
the Mythopoeic Society, is lost forever. I never again participated in 
any of Jon's projects with the Mythopoeic people, or any other of his 
grand projects.</p>

<hr class=hr2s>

<p>** I knew several members of the Mythopoeic Society, but was not 
a member. I was no stranger to mythopoeic literature. I had read 
Tolkien's <u>Fellowship of the Ring</u> trilogy before most had heard 
of it - but, I <u>read</u> literature. I had, and have, no interest 
whatever in discussing it, analyzing it, or deconstructing it.</p>
