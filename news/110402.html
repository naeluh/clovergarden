<h1>Chinese Restaurateurs Protest Shark Fin Ban</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<h3>02 Apr 2011</h3> &nbsp; <span class=bg>A bill to outlaw the posession, 
sale, and consumption shark fin soup has been introduced into the California 
legislature by Paul Fong (D Sunnyvale - a reformed shark fin eater) and 
Jarred Huffman (D San Rafael). Chinese restaurateurs are up in arms, saying 
"If we let them ban shark fin, they will come after other Chinese delicacies". 
"This is very unfair to the Chinese people. If we don't say something now the 
fine cuisine of China will disappear".</span>

<p>This is total bunk. Items most likely to be banned are those 
supposed to help Chinese guys keep their dicks up longer - and apparently the more 
rare and endangered the species the more effective it is expected to be. 
There's plenty of "bull pizzle" for sale in the Asian markets here. 
If that isn't good enough for you, and you really feel a need for rhino horn, 
pangolin or tiger penis, then why don't you just get yourself some of those 
blue pills - they actually work. If you really can't comprehend a Chinese 
celebration without mutilating sharks, then ask the Armenians to show you 
how it's done.

<p>The method of obtaining shark fins is to catch sharks, cut off their 
fins and toss them back to die of asphyxiaton (sharks have to keep moving 
to breath - and they need fins for that). Shark meat, which is very fine 
grilled and cooked many other ways, is not harvested because it doesn't 
fetch so high a price for so little work as fins do.</p>

<p>This fishery is not only totally inhumane, it is done without any regard 
to the endangered status of any particular species of shark, or to the 
ecological balance of the world's oceans.</p>

<p>To be fair, those who oppose the ban claim to be against cruelty to 
sharks, but they say "This is not a California problem, this is an Asian 
problem". So true - but somebody has to get reform started - the Chinese  
certainly won't do it themselves - they'll need to be shamed into it.</p>

<p>One restaurateur has stated he would be hurt financially because 
as much as a third of his business involves serving shark fin soup. So tell 
me, Jackie, if <u>nobody</u> could serve shark fin soup, would Chinese 
in California simply stop having wedding banquets because there wouldn't 
be soup? I rather think they would not - the impact on your business would 
be rather small. Of course no Chinese banquet hall can discontinue shark 
fin soup alone without losing business - all must do it together, and that 
takes legislation.</p>
 
<p>The Asian markets around here sell "artificial shark fin" for soup. I 
haven't tried it and have no way to compare it to the real thing without 
buying real shark fin, but the main reason it would not be acceptable is 
it simply isn't expensive enough. It's the high cost of shark fin that 
makes it so essential to banquet hosts. Surely some other ridiculously 
costly dish can be found to replace it. </p>

<p>As for "the fine cuisine of China" disappearing - that's total bull 
byproducts. One could easily come up with 10,000 perfectly fine Chinese 
recipes, ranging from complex palace cuisine to the peasant hut, that do 
not involve mutilation or species extinction - and that's a real 10,000, 
not a traditional Chinese exaggeration meaning "more than 10".</p>

<p>Here at CloveGarden we are enthusiastically in favor of legislation 
banning posession, consumption, and sale of shark fin. Our fish page has 
urged people to avoid shark fin for as long as we've had a fish page.</p>
