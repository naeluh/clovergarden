A very simple but refreshing and enjoyable Southeast Asian style salad for 
warm summer days. You can vary the chili bite to suit your taste, but it 
should not be too mild.  It can be made at least a day ahead and 
refrigerated.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1+ hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in hot water (a little too hot for you to 
    hold a finger in). As always with food it's better to heat cold water 
    than to use hot tap water. Let soak for 20 minutes or a bit more. 
    Drain and chill in cold water, then drain again. Stretch out on the 
    cutting board and cut into lengths of about 3 inches.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b> into strips about 1/8 inch square and 2 inches 
    or so long. A julienning vegetable peeler is invaluable for this job. 
    You could also use the coarse side of a box grater, but crosswise 
    slices don't blend so well with the noodles (see <a href="0gv_btcuke1.html#01">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILIS</b> very fine and add to <b>Cucumbers</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Dressing Items</b>, making sure the sugar is dissolved 
    (I run it to powder in my spice grinder so it dissolves faster).</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>ALL Items</b> and allow to rest for as long as 
   you can, turning now and then. If in a hurry, let sit at room temperature 
   and then chill for 1/2 hour or more in the fridge. Overnight in the 
   fridge is better. The longer it rests the better the flavors will blend 
   and the chilis will be less sharp.</li>
  <li>Garnish as desired (<a href="0gv_btcuke1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>) and serve.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; Around here thin bean threads are most 
  commonly in hanks of 1-3/4 t 2 ounces weight, but other forms are also 
  seen, including bulk and 2 ounce hanks. DO NOT confuse these with 
  similar looking Rice Sticks - totally different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html"><b>Asian Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Persian or similar cucumbers which need 
  neither peeling nor seeding are preferable, but if all you have is 
  waxed blimps peel them, split lengthwise and seed them. If 
  you're using a julienning peeler you can just peel (with a regular 
  peeler), then use the julienning peeler all around until you hit the 
  seed mass.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Thai Chilis are a natural here. 3 
  will make this salad quite sharp, and 1 will not be quite mild, so 
  use your own best judgement. Serranos can also be used, and are not 
  as hot, but they've gotten rather large lately, and vary in hotness. 
  I'd start with a half of one and see how it goes. You can always 
  add more. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The almost universally available 
  Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce will do fine, or anything like it.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Black Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar is 
  easily available these days. Pearl River Bridge is a good brand. If 
  you don't have it, an "industrial" balsamic vinegar can be substituted, 
  or you can use regular rice vinegar for a lighter color and flavor. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
  <b>Vinegars and Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Palm sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this you can use 
  Turbinado or some other lightly refined sugar.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; Raw Peanuts, dry pan roasted and crushed, 
  are a very popular garnish in Southeast Asia. For details see our 
  recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>. 
  I'm not that fond of peanut garnishes, so I usually garnish with 
  cilantro leaves or threads of Fresno chili.</li>
