A cool refreshing salad for warm summer days - and low calorie too! This one 
has almost no chili bite, unless you add some. It can be made at least a 
day ahead and refrigerated.

  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in hot water (a little too hot for you to 
    hold a finger in). As always with food it's better to heat cold water 
    than to use water heater water. Let soak for 20 minutes or a bit more. 
    Drain and chill in cold water, then drain again. Stretch out on the 
    cutting board and cut into lengths of about 3 inches.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b> into thin juliennes. about 2 inches long. A 
    julienning vegetable peeler is invaluable here (see 
    <a href="0gv_btveg1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Grate <b>CARROTS</b> coarse or again 
    use a julienning vegetable peeler and cut to about 1-1/2 inches long. Cut 
    <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into slivers around 1-1/2 inches long.  Seed 
    <b>CHILIS</b> and slice into thin threads. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> 
    into slivers on a very shallow diagonal.  Mix All.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix 
    together <b>All Dressing items</b>. </li> 
  <li>Mix together <b>ALL Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve. This salad does fine refrigerated 
    overnight.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; Around here thin bean threads are most 
  commonly in hanks of 1-3/4 to 2 ounces weight, but other forms are also 
  seen, including bulk and 2 ounce hanks. DO NOT confuse these with 
  similar looking Rice Sticks - totally different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html"><b>Asian Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Persian or similar cucumbers which need 
  neither peeling nor seeding are preferable, but if all you have is 
  waxed blimps peel them, split lengthwise and seed them - then weigh 
  them. If you're using a julienning peeler you can just peel (with a 
  regular peeler), then use the julienning peeler all around until you 
  hit the seed mass.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fresno Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These are are only moderately hot, so 
  two of them gives just a little bite to this dish. Holland red and 
  similarly moderate chilis could also be used, or you can omit chilis 
  if you want no heat at all. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mirin</h3> &nbsp; Real Mirin (hon mirin, 8% to 14% alcohol) is 
  rare even here in Southern California, but <i>Mirin-fu chomiryo</i> 
  (mirin-like seasoning) is available in Asian markets and usually in 
  the Asian section of supermarkets, and will work. Lacking even that 
  use 1/2 T sugar per T mirin called for, and maybe toss in a 
  half tablespoon of sake with it.</li>
