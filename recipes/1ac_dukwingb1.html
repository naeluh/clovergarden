Asian markets here in Los Angeles move a lot of duck, but wings aren't a 
big item so they're plentiful and affordable (2009 US $1.49/#). They're 
larger than chicken wings with a deeper flavor.

Traditional accompaniments for Buffalo wings are celery sticks with blue 
cheese dressing and lots of beer - but I've found a sound red wine goes 
a lot better with these. Don't open that $40 bottle, this is food for 
barbarians not epicures - your palate will be in no shape to discuss 
the nuances of vineyard and vintage.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>WINGS</b> into separate joints, place in a sauce pan, add 
    <b>Bay Leaves</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Add <b>Water</b> as needed to 
    cover wings. Bring to a boil and simmer until quite tender, about 2 
    hours. Yes, that's a long time and would reduce chicken wings to 
    mush, but these are duck wings.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Wings</b> from the stock (reserve it for other uses). Discard 
    the tip joints and put the larger two joints into a mixing  bowl. Add 
    <b>All Marinade Items</b> and tumble to coat well. Let marinade for a 
    couple hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Tumble a 
    couple times to assure even coating.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Heat oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Oil a cookie sheet. Knock excess marinade off the <b>Wings</b> and 
    arrange them on the sheet in a single layer. Roast until as crispy as you 
    want - start checking at 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>While wings are roasting, put remaining <b>Marinade</b> in a saucepan 
    and bring up hot, adding a little stock as needed, and keep warm.</li>
  <li>When <b>Wings</b> are done, toss them with the warm sauce just before 
    serving.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Duck Wings:</b> &nbsp; This will be about 24 whole 
  wings making 48 pieces. Around here that's 4 trays. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bd_dkwingz.html"><b>Duck Wings</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Stock:</b> &nbsp; Preferably this will be duck stock you just made, 
  but chicken stock will do. Yeah, that's a lot of stock, but you'll end 
  up with more than you started with.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Marinade:</b> &nbsp; The amount of marinade given is sufficient for 
  moderately messy wings as in the photo. If you want really messy wings 
  make half again as much, or for dry crispy wings half as much 
  (and skip the final sauce tumble).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Hot Sauce:</b> &nbsp; The guy who invented Buffalo wings 
  (in Buffalo, New York) preferred Frank's Red Hot Original, but I use 
  Buffalo brand (no relation to New York) Jalapeno sauce. Tabasco Sauce 
  could be used (more liquid) or Huy Fong Foods' Sriracha (less liquid) 
  - or whatever you like. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html"><b>Chili Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05"><b>
  Chili Paste:</b> &nbsp; Huy Fong Foods' Sambal Oelec is fine and widely 
  available. If you're from the Frozen North and this is already looking 
  like a bad case of ring burn, you can skip this - but I wouldn't.</li>
