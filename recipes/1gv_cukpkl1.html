<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use Persian, Japanese or similar 
  cucumbers that don't need peeling or seeding. If all you have is the 
  standard waxed green blimps, you'll need to start with 2 pounds because 
  you'll have to peel and seed them. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html"><b>Cucumbers</b></a> page.</li>
<li id=02>
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp; Natural, medium tart pickles are best, and the 
  ingredients must not list sugar. The pickles I usually use are 
  imported from India, the worlds largest exporter of pickles.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Salting:</h3> &nbsp; The longer the finished salad will be held, 
  the longer the salting should be to remove as much water as possible. 
  Water will continue to be drawn from the cucumbers after the salad is 
  made, so it's holding time is limited. In about a day and a half in 
  the fridge it starts to ferment - not dangerous, but a bit bubbly.</li>
