<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was made with tiny Dutch Yellow 
  potatoes. Second choice would be Red Potatoes (the smaller the better). 
  Beyond that you'll need boiling type potatoes peeled and cubed before 
  cooking. For details see our <a href ="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tzatziki</h3> &nbsp; [Cucumber Yogurt Salad] &nbsp; This is an extremely 
  popular salad all through the Balkans, Levant, and on to Persia and India. 
  Very easy to make by our recipe <a href="ygv_cukyogurt1.html"><b>Cucumber 
  Yogurt Salad</b></a></li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Not one of my 11 Greek cookbooks has anything 
  even suggesting something like this salad. I find no recipe on the Internet 
  by anyone who seems even remotely Greek, and the Tzatziki part varies a 
  lot, so I'm presuming this is an American salad. I have, however, added 
  some Kalamata Olives to make it a little more Greek, and I've posted it 
  also under Greece, in case any Greeks have a different opinion.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipe replace 2 Tablespoons of the Yogurt 
  with 2 Tablespoons of Sour Cream to make the dressing richer. For California 
  Style, cap and core a Jalape&ntilde;o Chili, cut it into very tiny dice, 
  and stir it in.</li>
