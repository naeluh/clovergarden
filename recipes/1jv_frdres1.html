"French Dressing" is totally unrelated to anything French, it's strictly 
North American. This recipe is way better than bottled dressings, but see

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Pure Olive Oil is good, but Virgin is a bit fancy for 
  this recipe. Since it won't be heated, most other Edible Oils can be used.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Creamy Style</h3> &nbsp; For creamy style French Dressing, just whip 
  in 2 to 3 Tablespoons of Mayonnaise.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Visitors from France are really annoyed that 
  this dressing is called "French". For the real thing see 
  <a href="fjv_frogvg1.html"><b>French Vinaigrette</b></a>. This one is 
  very   tasty, but the recipe contains a <u>lot</u> of sugar. I've cut it 
  well below any recipe I've seen on the Internet, some of which call for as 
  much as 1 cup (Gaaaaa!), and it's still more than enough. It also includes 
  a lot of Ketchup, which contains more sugar than Ice cream. That's why kids 
  love it so much - it's tomato candy. I consider sugar an addictive toxin, 
  as do many nutritionists, so I don't use this dressing much.  Of course, 
  you are free to do as you please, including adding more sugar.</li>
