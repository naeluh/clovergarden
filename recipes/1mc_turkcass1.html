This satisfying stew is of beans, leftover turkey, and sausages, baked 
under a green crust of bread crumbs and herbs. It takes quite a 
few steps, but the pace is leisurely.

Actually, you can make most of this dish ahead, and finish when the 
leftover turkey becomes available. This method starts in a saut&eacute; 
pan and finishes in a coverable casserole but you could do it in one 
flame and oven-proof vessel all the way through.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 to 8 hrs - 8 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak the <b>BEANS</b> 8 hours in water with 1/2 T salt (yes, salt) 
    - <b><u>OR</u></b> - put them in a pot with three cups of water and 
    1/2 T salt, bring to a boil, remove from the  heat and let soak for 
    at least an hour (see our page 
    <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried 
    Beans</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="1">
  <li>Cut <b>SAUSAGES</b> into largish chunks.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>TURKEY</b> into pieces about the same size as the sausage 
    chunks.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> and <b>CARROT</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cut enough <b>Bread</b> into cubes to make one cup. Bake in oven 
    at about 325&deg;F/160&deg;C just long enough to be firm but not 
    browned. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Preheat Oven to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Place the <b>Sausage pieces</b> In a saut&eacute; pan sufficient to 
     hold the entire recipe. Add 1/8 inch water and place on high heat. 
     When the water has boiled out it should have rendered enough fat to 
     fry the sausage pieces. Fry stirring until lightly browned all over. 
     Remove sausage and set aside leaving the fat in the pan.</li>
  <li>Add the <b>Onion mix</b> to the pan and fry stirring until onions 
     are translucent but not starting to color. If your sausage didn't 
     produce enough fat to fry add a little olive oil.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Diced Tomatoes</b>, including their juice, and deglaze 
     the pan. Pour in the soaked <b>Beans</b> and enough <b>Stock</b> to 
     just come to the top of the beans. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> 
     and <b>Pepper</b> and stir to mix thoroughly. Bring to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Place all <b>Herbs items</b> in the bottom of a coverable ovenproof 
    casserole. Pour the <b>Bean Mix</b> over and arrange the 
    <b>Sausage Chunks</b> on top. Adjust <b>Stock</b> level to just come 
    up to the top of the beans.</li>
  <li>Cover tightly and bake in the oven for 1-1/2 hours at 350&deg;F.
    </li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; prepare the <b>Topping</b>. Run the bread 
    cubes in a small food processor or other device until reduced to 
    crumbs. Crush and chop one clove of <b>GARLIC</b>.  Chop 
    <b>PARSLEY</b>. And both to the <b>Crumbs</b>. Process a moment 
    to mix, then add 1/2 T <b>Olive Oil</b> and process a few moments 
    more to blend.</li>
  <li>Uncover the casserole and place the turkey chunks around among the 
    sausage chunks pressing them down a little into the beans. Check the 
    stock level and add more if required to bring it up nearly to the top 
    of the beans.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the <b>Topping Mix</b> evenly over the top of the casserole, 
    check that nothing sticks up too high and put it back in the oven, 
    uncovered. Bake at 350&deg;F/175&deg;C for another 1/2 hour when the 
    crust should be lightly browned and the dish bubbly.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sausage:</h3> &nbsp;  Mild Italian sausage links 
  will do, or any other flavorful sausage that will hold together well 
  in big chunks when fried.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp;  preferably this will be stock 
  you just made out of the roasted turkey carcass after stripping the 
  meat off.</li>
