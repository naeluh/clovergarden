<h1>Tofurky</h1>
<br><img src="img/1mv_tofurky11f.jpg" alt="Tofurky Dinner Served on Platter"  class="mrg">

This is actually the recipe from the Tofurky box, reorganized here with 
pictures for those who wish to know more about it before laying out $9.99
(2009 US) for the boxed set over at Trader Joe's. Tofurky is a registered 
trademark of Turtle Islands Foods (tofurkey is the generic form).

<p>The boxed set includes the Tofurky and a tub of Mushroom and "Giblet" 
gravy, which is also used in this recipe. It is claimed "100% Vegan", 
meaning it includes no animal products whatever and is safe to serve to 
your over-idealistic teenage daughter (so long as she doesn't see it comes 
in a cardboard box and call it "over-packaged"). It is not, however, celiac 
safe as most of its texture is derived from wheat gluten, not tofu.</p>

<p>So how is it as actual food?  Actually, pretty decent. The stuffing is better 
than some I've had with real turkeys, the gravy is pretty decent and the 
turkey, although it can't compete with real turkey, is quite edible. It 
should be cut with a very sharp knife, possibly with serrations, and individual 
steak knives at the table aren't a bad idea either since the outer skin is 
just a touch fork resistant.

OK, here it is with it's plastic wrapper carefully peeled away. A stuffed 
wheat gluten sausage weighing a hair under 1 pound 12 ounces. Mercifully, 
no attempt has been made to make it look like an actual turkey (all brands 
may not be so discreet).

All arranged in the casserole with vegetables, all brushed with the 
Baste. Oooooops! Forgot the onions for this photo - got 'em in at the 20 
minute mark so all was OK.
