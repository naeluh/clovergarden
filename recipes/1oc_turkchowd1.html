A satisfying soup that will help use up all that leftover Thanksgiving 
turkey. As with other soups of this sort, the cream is stirred in off 
the heat - but that doesn't mean you can't reheat it.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Shred <b>TURKEY</b> into pieces about 3/4 inch long</li>
  <li>Dice <b>BACON</b> about 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>POTATOES</b> about 3/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> about 1/2 inch, cut <b>CELERY</b> into slices 
    about 1/4 inch thick, mix.</li>
  <li>Strip leaves from <b>THYME</b>, chop <b>SAGE</b> small and mix into 
    Onions.</li>
  <li>Place <b>BACON</b> in a saut&eacute; pan and add about 1/8 inch of 
    <b>Water</b>. Let the water boil down to render some fat, then turn the 
    heat down a bit and fry the bacon stirring until it is just crisp.</li>
  <li>Pour off all but about 2/3 T of the bacon fat, add the <b>Onion 
    mix</b> and fry stirring until onions are translucent but not yet 
    showing color.</li>
  <li>Pour the <b>Fried mix</b> into your soup pot. Use some of the 
    <b>Stock</b> to deglaze the saut&eacute; pan and pour it all into the 
    pot. Add the <b>Potatoes</b>, bring to a boil and simmer until the 
    potatoes are nearly done.</li>
  <li>Squish a couple pieces of potato against the side of the pot as 
    needed to thicken the soup a bit. Add <b>Turkey meat</b> and simmer 
    another 5 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, check 
    consistency and add more stock if needed.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat and stir in <b>CREAM</b>. Serve in bowls with some 
    <b>PARSLEY</b> leaves for garnish.  If you reheat it, the surface 
     appearance will change a little, not quite as creamy smooth, but the 
     flavor and texture will be just fine.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> White Rose potatoes work well 
  in recipes of this type, but Red potatoes will also work. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes which turn to mush if cooked just a little 
  long. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> Preferably this will be stock you 
  just made out of the roasted turkey carcass after stripping the meat 
  off. Chicken stock could also be used.</li>
