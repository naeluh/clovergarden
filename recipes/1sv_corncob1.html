Corn on the Cob, in a <a href="1sv_corncob1.html#04"><b>Corn Dish</b></a> and fitted with a 
pair of Corn Horns, with butter and salt. You can't get more American than 
this. The corn dish holds a pool of butter so you can rotate the cob in it.

<p>A regular North American cob of Corn will have about 4-1/2 ounces of 
edible kernels. For a side or snack, 1 cob per person will do, but if its' 
the main dish, 2 cobs per person.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Husk the <b>CORN</b> and snap off the stem end, while you bring a big 
    pot of <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
  <li>Melt plenty of <b>Salted Butter</b>.</li>
  <li>Drop the Cobs into the rapidly boiling water. Poke the cobs down into 
    the water and keep them turning so they don't have an undercooked side. 
    For medium size cobs about 3 minutes is all it takes, for very large ones 
    maybe 4. Generally, if the water has come back to a boil over highest 
    heat, they are done.</li>
  <li>If you have to hold the corn, pour enough cold water into the pot to 
    stop cooking, but not too much so the water stays hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, with Corn Horns in place. Provide plenty of Melted Butter 
    and Salt in a Salt Shaker. See <a href="1sv_corncob1.html#03"><b>Eating</b></a> notes.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweet Corn:</h3> &nbsp; Buy from a vendor with fast turnover. Do not 
  remove husks at the store, this just accelerates conversion of sugars to 
  starch. Shuck just before cooking. Use as soon as possible, and refrigerate 
  if there will be delay. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_cncobz.html"><b>Corn on the Cob</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good quality <u>Salted</u> Butter. Unsalted 
  butter tastes like axle grease.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eating:</h3> &nbsp; There are two styles of corn eating: "Typewriter 
  style", where several rows are taken out from one end to another, then 
  rotate up to the next few rows, and "Lathe style" where the cob is rotated 
  all the way around as it is eaten from one end to the other. I use 
  "typewriter style" and have no idea what those "lathe" people are thinking. 
  Typewriter style allows proper distribution of Butter in the Corn Dish. 
  I always make a second "gleaning" pass to pick up what was missed on the 
  first pass.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Corn Dish:</h3> &nbsp; Be careful buying Corn Dishes. Many are designed 
  in Asia where cobs of corn are much shorter. They won't fit our corn.</li>
