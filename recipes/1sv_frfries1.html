Stick shaped fries are said to have been typical of Belgium, not France
(see <a href="1sv_frfries1.html#05"><b>History</b></a>). This recipe is based on 
research by J. Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt on making fries competitive with 
McDonalds in the home (see 
<a href="1sv_frfries1.html#03"><b>McDonalds</b></a> and <a href="1sv_frfries1.html#04"><b>Method</b></a>).

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into French Fries about 1/4 inch 
    on a side, but not greater than 3/8 inch. Place in a pot with 2 qt 
    <b>Water</b>, then stir in 2 T <b>Vinegar</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer until potatoes are just cooked through, about 10 minutes. 
    Drain well, and set out on paper towels to dry for about 10 minutes 
    or more.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, Wok or other 
    suitable deep fry container, bring <b>Oil</b> up to 
    400&deg;F/200&deg;C. Fry <b>Potatoes</b> in batches that are not 
    crowded in the oil <u>for 50 seconds only</u>. OK, my antique stove 
    can't quite maintain 360&deg;F, so I give them 60 seconds. Drain 
    and place on paper towels. Bring the oil back to 400&deg;F and do 
    the next batch, until all are done. Let them cool for at least 30 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>The <b>Fries</b> can be frozen at this point. Freeze them in a 
    single layer, then pack into plastic bags. When needed, they can 
    be fried without thawing. Freezing actually improves the quality 
    of the finished fries, and they can go into the hot oil without 
    thawing.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min (3 batches))
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat the <b>Oil</b> back to 400&deg;F and fry the <b>Fries</b> 
    in batches, and over sufficient heat to keep the oil at about 
    360&deg;F/180&deg;C. Watch the color carefully. The fries should 
    be fished out and drained when a medium blonde. They should never 
    be darker than shown in the photo. Fish them out with a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_spider1.html">Spider</a>, which will take much 
    less oil with them than other devices. Salt to taste immediately, 
    and let drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>While additional batches are being fried, you can hold Fries in 
    a 200&deg;F/93&deg;C oven, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Clean-up</u></b>
  <ol start="6">
  <li>When all done, filter your oil through paper towels and store in 
    a glass jar or metal can away from heat and light so it is good for 
    several more batches, or you can use it for other frying jobs, 
    including pan frying.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Only Russets (Baking 
  Potatoes) should be considered for French Fries, as they can produce 
  the desired fluffy interior and crisp crust. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; You need a very durable high 
  temperature Oil, and enough of it so the batches of whatever size 
  you wish to fry are not crowded and don't cool the oil too much. 
  A quart is about minimum for 2 pounds of raw fries done in three 
  batches. Mr. L&oacute;pez-Alt prefers Peanut Oil, which at 19% 
  saturated fats gives better mouth feel than, say, Canola at 7%. I use 
  Olive Pomace Oil, 15% saturated but with 1/3 the amount of rancidity 
  prone polyunsaturated oils compared to Peanut Oil. Avocado oil has 
  20% saturated and as little polyunsaturated as Olive Pomace. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oilchart.html"><b>Oils Chart</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>McDonalds:</h3> &nbsp; The fries served by 
  the McDonalds chain are famous for their quality and ability to stay 
  crisp. Their method is impractical in the home because it involves 
  soaking the raw fries for exactly 15 minutes in a large amount 
  of water held at exactly 170&deg;F/76.7&deg;C. This stiffens the 
  surface of the fries, removes surface sugars and makes the interior 
  fluffier. They are then given a short deep fry, flash frozen, 
  and bagged for shipment.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; J. Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt 
  has developed a method providing results similar to McDonalds, but 
  more practical for home use. He uses an effect I'd discovered many 
  years ago, but had mainly avoided rather than used. A controlled 
  amount of acid in the initial cooking water stiffens the surface of 
  the fries, while the surface sugars (which cause premature 
  browning) are washed away, the interior gets fluffy, and frying time
  is greatly reduced. A good fry has a thick crisp outer shell, even 10 
  or more minutes out of the oil. It snaps rather than bending even 5 
  minutes or more out of the oil, is fluffy inside and never hollow.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; The earliest reference to 
  "fried potatoes" in France is from 1775, which blows away a number of 
  origin stories. The original "French Fry" was a round slice, as 
  attested by Thomas Jefferson (1802) and E.Warren (England 1856). They 
  were certainly still round in North America at the birth of the 
  Saratoga Chip (Potato Chip). It is said that stick shaped fries were 
  typical of Belgium, where they were served to American soldiers during 
  WW I (1918). The soldiers thought they were still in France, and upon 
  return to North America, demanded "French Fries". </li>
