Mashed potatoes are fine if you have gravy, but robust smashed potatos 
are more able to stand on their own, and can be enhanced further 
with herbs. Here they're shown with scallion tops.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Put the <b>POTATOES</b> (skin-on) in a pot with <b>Water</b> to 
    cover, <b>Bay Leaf</b> and 1 t <b>Salt</b>. Boil gently until just 
    cooked all the way through. They are done when a sharp skewer will 
    go through the center of largest one without encountering a stiff 
    spot.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and mix thoroughly with <b>Sour Cream</b> (see 
    <a href="1sv_potatsmsh1.html#02">Note-2</a>), <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Fish <b>Potatoes</b> out of the water <u>reserving 1/2 cup of the 
    water</u>, let them dry out so the skins are not slippery and smash 
   them up (still skin-on) with a wooden spatula or similar tool. Stir 
   in the <b>Butter mix</b> and adjust consistency with reserved cooking 
   water as needed (more important if they will be held for awhile).</li>
  <li>Finally, stir in <b>Green Herb</b> of choice (scallion tops, 
    chives, basil, sage, etc.).</li>
  <li>Serve hot. If you must hold them use a warm oven. If you must 
    reheat them use a moderate oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Red are best and add some skin color. 
  White Rose will do. Yukon Gold type may be too mushy, and Russets are 
  too dry, crumbly, and would have to be peeled. Potatoes about 2 inches 
  in diameter are good - too small there's too much skins and too big 
  there's too little. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sour Cream</h3> is optional. Some cooks use 1/2 cup 
  <b>Cream Cheese</b> in its place.</li>
