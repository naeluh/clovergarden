Legend has it Potato Chips (Crisps in GB) were invented by master chef 
George Crum, in Saratoga New York (see <a href="1sv_potchip1.html#04"><b>History</b></a>). 
This recipe eliminates most of the difficulties with home made potato 
chips (see <a href="1sv_potchip1.html#03"><b>Method</b></a>).

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into very thin slices using a 
    Mandolin or similar slicer. They should be very even in thickness.
    Place in a pot with 2 qt <b>Water</b>, then stir in 2 T 
    <b>Vinegar</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. 
    Drain well, and set out on paper towels to dry for 20 minutes or 
    more. Shuffle them a few times to eliminate water between the chips.
    You will notice the chips are quite firm after this step.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, Wok or 
    other suitable deep fry container, bring <b>Oil</b> up to 
    400&deg;F/200&deg;C. Fry <b>Potatoes</b> in batches that are not 
    crowded in the oil, regulating the heat so the oil doesn't rise 
    higher than about 360&deg;F/180&deg;C. When they are a light 
    blond color, fish them out with a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_spider1.html"><b>Spider</b></a>, which will take 
    much less oil with them than other devices. Salt to taste immediately, 
    and let drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Clean-up</u></b>
  <ol start="6">
  <li>When all done, filter your oil through paper towels and store in 
    a glass jar or metal can away from heat and light so it is good for 
    several more batches, or you can use it for other frying jobs, 
    including pan frying.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Use Russets (Baking Potatoes) for Potato 
  Chips. Others will make decent chips, but, why not use the best when 
  it's cheaper? For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; You need a very durable high 
  temperature Oil, and enough of it so the batches of whatever size 
  you wish to fry are not crowded and don't cool the oil too much.
  You will need more than for French Fries, and will lose more in 
  draining. About 1-1/2 quart should be sufficient for 2 pounds of raw 
  slices done in three batches. I use Olive Pomace Oil which gives 
  good mouth feel (15% saturated fats) but with very little rancidity 
  prone polyunsaturated oils. Avocado oil would do even better (20% 
  saturated) with as little polyunsaturated as Olive Pomace, but is 
  more expensive. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oilchart.html"><b>Oils Chart</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I well remember my first 
  experience, many years ago, with making potato chips at home, and it 
  was awful. The frying was tedious, the chips were too dark, and the 
  stove was awash in oil. I made no more for many years. This method is 
  a dream in comparison. It is based on our successful 
  <a href="1sv_frfries1.html"><b>French Fries</b></a> recipe, but skips 
  the first frying - there just isn't any inside to make fluffy in a 
  potato chip. Frying time is relatively short, producing fully crisp 
  chips with a nice light color (they could be even lighter than in the 
  photo), and no splattering oil! Of course, using an Indian Kadhai and 
  Spider instead of the French style basket fryer I had used before 
  helped with the splattering (a wok would also work well), but it 
  would still have been way less. The secret is in the initial par boil 
  with vinegar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Legend has it that, in 1853, master chef 
  George Crum, in Saratoga New York, was furious that a customer had 
  sent back his French Fries as "too thick". He grabbed a potato and 
  sliced it as thin as he could, and being an expert chef, he could 
  slice plenty thin. He fried them lightly browned and sent them out. 
  The customer loved them. Later versions of the story claim the 
  customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt, but that's unlikely. They were 
  known as "Saratoga Chips" until well after World War I, and 
  manufacturers produced "Saratoga Slicers" for those without Mr. Crum's 
  knife skills. In England, the "Crisp" is credited to William Kitchiner, 
  but his slices were French Fry thick, and his alternate method produced 
  a very different shape, of unknown (and difficult to control) thickness. 
  Laura Scudder, in Monterey Park, California, invented the packaging 
  that made potato chips a popular snack item.
