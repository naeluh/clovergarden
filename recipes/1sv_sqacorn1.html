Simple to prepare and tasty (though you do have to wait over an hour to 
eat it). I like these for breakfast, with just butter, but some people 
sweeten theirs and add spices (see <a href="1sv_sqacorn1.html#01"><b>Options</b></a>). 
This squash can also be used as a side dish and serve four.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Set <b>ACORN SQUASH</b> on it's stem end and slice in half 
    lengthwise - this takes a bit of strength and care. Easier to use a 
    razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife and drive it down with a soft 
    faced mallet. Scoop out seeds and fibers.</li>
  <li>Taking care you don't slip and cut yourself, cut a cross hatch 
    pattern in each <b>Squash</b>  half, going as deep as you can without 
    breaking through the skin.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Squash</b> halves in a buttered oven-proof baking dish, 
    shaving a little off the bottom if needed so they stand straight.</li> 
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and pour it carefully over the squash halves. 
    You should end up with a fairly deep pool of butter in the cavity to 
    dip pieces into as you eat the squash.</li>
  <li>Apply any <a href="1sv_sqacorn1.html#01"><b>Options</b></a> you desire.</li>
  <li>Bake at 400&deg;F/200&deg; until done and lightly browned on top, 
    about 1-1/4 hours. When they're starting to color use a brush to spread 
    some of the butter around the edges.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Some people add a fair sprinkling of brown 
  sugar or maple syrup to the butter. A sprinkle of ground cinnamon 
  or allspice is also popular. </li>
