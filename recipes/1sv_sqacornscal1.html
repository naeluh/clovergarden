This is a really excellent vegetable side dish for roast turkey or the 
like - or it can be a vegetarian main dish. It reheats well in the 
oven.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut your <b>ACORN SQUASH</b> into segments along the lengthwise 
    grooves so you can peel it, then cut into about 3/4 inch chunks. 
    A razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet 
    can be very helpful here.</li>
  <li>Tear up or cut the leaves of the <b>CHARD</b>. Slice the stems 
    at a diagonal and fairly thin. Keep separate from leaves,</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise then slice thin.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>Nutmeg</b>, grind <b>Pepper</b> and mix both with 
    <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> on the large holes of your grater.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + 45 min in the oven 
    (1-1/2 hr total))
  <br>I do all but the baking in a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan.
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li> 
  <li>Bring 6 cups of <b>Water</b> to a boil. Stir in the <b>Chard Stems</b> 
    for 5 minutes, then add the leaves and stir until wilted, about 2 
    minutes. Scoop out (keeping the hot water) and quench in cold water.
    </li>
  <li>Put the <b>Squash chunks</b> in the hot water, simmer until just 
    tender - <u>do not overcook</u>. Drain, cool, and mix with the Chard.
    </li>
  <li>Heat 1-1/2 T of <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring 
    until light golden, A sprinkle of salt will help them brown evenly. 
    Remove from pan and set aside, leaving as much oil behind as 
    possible.</li>
  <li>Add the other 2 T of <b>Olive Oil</b> in the pan. Heat over 
    moderate flame, then sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly 
    until flour is cooked, but <u>not browned</u>, to make a blonde 
    roux.</li>
  <li>Over moderate heat, slowly stir in cold <b>Broth</b>, stirring 
    constantly to work it into a smooth lump-free sauce.</li>
  <li>Lower heat, stir in <b>Nutmeg mix</b> and simmer very slowly for 5 
    minutes or so. Adjust consistency as needed, it needs to be pourable 
    when a little cooler, but not so pourable it all sinks to the bottom. 
    Turn off heat.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Onions</b> and 1/3 of the <b>Cheese</b> (2 oz) into 
    the Squash / Chard mix. Tumble well, pulling apart lumps of Chard 
    Leaves as you go.</li>
  <li>Butter a suitable gratin dish (11x7 inch) or casserole (8 cup).
    </li>
  <li>Fill the gratin dish with the Squash mix. Level it well, then pour 
    the <b>Sauce</b> over it evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 
    <b>Cheese</b> on top.</li>
  <li>Bake at 375&deg;F/190&deg;C for about 45 minutes or until it the 
    center begins to get bubbly. If the cheese isn't browned enough, 
    finish in the broiler for 3 minutes or so.</li>

  <h3>Acorn Squash:</h3> &nbsp; These are commonly available in North 
  America. The now commonly available Kabocha Squash is a very good 
  alternative. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/squash.html"><b>Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Swiss Chard:</h3> &nbsp; I use white stem, but red would be OK. 
  Spinach could be used for a somewhat different flavor and texture.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Monterey Jack, Swiss or similar can be used - 
  a light colored cheese that melts well.</li>
