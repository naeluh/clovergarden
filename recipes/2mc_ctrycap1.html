  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1-1/2 to 2 inch chunks. Stay to the 
    high side, as small pieces will make too much sauce.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Flour</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Place in a shallow 
    bowl ready to coat chicken.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your propane torch and brush 
    off skin under running water. Cut into strips about 1/4 inch wide 
    by 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium. Crush and chop <b>GARLIC</b> small. Chop 
    <b>CELERY</b> medium. Mix all with <b>Bell Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>TOMATOES</b> from the juice (keeping the juice) and chop 
    fairly small. Return to the juice.</li>
  <li>Pour hot water over <b>RAISINS</b>, enough to cover well, and let 
    soak.</li>
  <li>Toast <b>ALMONDS</b> to a light golden color in a dry pan or in the 
    oven.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>CORIANDER</b> and mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr, depending)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Pat <b>Chicken</b> dry with paper towels so not too much flour will 
    adhere (see <a href="2mc_ctrycap1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  <li>In a coverable chicken frier or saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> 
    at least 1/4 inch deep (see <a href="2mc_ctrycap1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>). Dust 
    <b>Chicken</b> pieces lightly in <b>Flour mix</b>. Shake off all 
    excess and fry in batches over moderately high heat until golden 
    (the chicken will not be cooked through). Control heat to not burn 
    any flour that falls off the chicken. Drain chicken on paper toweling 
    and set aside. This will take 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour off all but 1-1/2 T of the oil. Stir in the <b>Onion mix</b> 
    and fry stirring over medium high heat until onions are translucent.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spice mix</b> and <b>Tomatoes</b> (including juice). 
    Fry stirring until nearly dry.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Raisins</b> and stir in along with <b>Chicken</b> and 
    <b>Water</b>. Simmer covered another 30 to 45 minutes, stirring now 
    and then, until chicken is cooked through and tender. Adjust liquid as 
    needed - not too dry.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, sprinkled with <b>Almonds</b> and with plenty of steamed 
    long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for skinless 
  and boneless. You can use bone-in joints, with legs and thighs cut in 
  pieces (use a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced 
  mallet), but they must be skinless.  I use leg and thigh meat for 
  better flavor and texture than the cardboard breast meat we get 
  around here. The smaller the pieces the more sauce you will end up 
  with because the flour coating acts as a thickener.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Almonds:</h3> &nbsp; Properly these are blanched 
  whole almonds dry roasted in a pan kept at around 410&deg;F/210&deg;C, 
  turning almost constantly with a thin metal turner until light golden. 
  You can roast them days in advance (provided you hide them well) but 
  if you're in a hurry, using commercially roasted almonds is acceptable. 
  I've found oven roasting less than satisfactory because: &nbsp; a) 
  here in Sunny Southern California we don't fire up an oven unless we 
  really need to; &nbsp; b) they always get forgotten and burn.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Madras Curry Powder, 
  an Anglo-Indian invention from the Raj. Use a good brand (Sun or Ship) 
  available in cans in markets. Of course it's better made fresh per our 
  recipe: <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cayenne:</h3> &nbsp; Actually, I use India extra hot, but it's 
  about the same. 1/4 t gives the recipe a noticeable bite - use your 
  own best judgement.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; The flour coating the chicken and that adhering 
  to the pan becomes the thickener for the stew. If there is too much, 
  the stew will be too thick and a little bland.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; In the American South chicken is commonly fried 
  in a deep coverable cast iron pan called a "chicken frier". For large 
  batches I find this tedious and messy, so I deep fry the chicken in an 
  Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, the ultimate 
  deep frying device. I then start the onion in a coverable 
  saut&eacute; pan. Actually, I often do the chicken frying a day ahead 
  and refrigerate until needed.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; There are many minor variations. Currants 
  or black raisins may be used. Some recipes do not fry the chicken but 
  simmer it. This is easier and reduces calories but also reduces flavor 
  and seriously departs from the original Anglo-Indian recipe. In India 
  chicken and fish are usually fried before using to make a curry. In 
  England the chicken is fried but chicken stock and lemon juice are 
  used instead of tomatoes. There are many variations there too.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Leftovers:</h3> &nbsp; Break up the chicken a bit and use it as 
  pasta sauce or similar. Delicious!</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Some claim this dish was invented by 
  a chef in Pennsylvania. This is highly unlikely since conceptually 
  similar dishes of this name exist in the American Southeast, England 
  and India. Also, the name would be meaningless in Pennsylvania. 
  Savannah Georgia was once a major port of entry for the spice trade, 
  with most of the spices coming from India. This dish is probably named 
  for captains of India based ships called "country ships" during the 
  Raj, thus "Country Captain". It could also be named after an Indian 
  native serving as a captain in the British army, also a "Country 
  Captain", but its prominence in American and English seaports 
  suggests the nautical origin. Anglo-Indian Country Captain (as made 
  in India) differs in being a rather dry curry, but it's still fried 
  chicken with curry spices and onions. In England it is made with 
  stock rather than tomato broth and soured with lemon or lime. In 
  keeping with Indian practice, the chicken is skinless and the dish 
  is served with steamed long grain rice. In Georgia and England, it 
  would originally have been Carolina (Patna type) rice, but there's 
  nothing to stop us from serving it with superior Thai Jasmine rice. 
  Patna type rice is grown in Texas and Louisiana, sold simply as 
  "Long Grain Rice. Carolina rice was no longer grown in the Carolinas 
  after the Civil War, because the methods used were dependant on 
  slavery, but a grower now produces a slightly improved version 
  sold as Carolina Gold rice.</li>
