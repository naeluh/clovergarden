A sweet sour pork recipe that reminds of Chinese. The main difference 
is that big serving pieces require a knife at the table - unthinkable in 
Asia, that assassination could be as easy as picking up a table knife.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>COUNTRY STYLE RIBS</b> into serving size chunks, removing all 
    excess fat and any bones.</li>
  <li>Tumble Coat <b>Pork Ribs</b> with a mix of <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> 
    and <b>Cajun Seasoning</b>. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Scrape 1 t zest from your <b>ORANGE</b> then squeeze it for juice.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix together all <b>Sauce Items</b>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Tumble coat <b>Pork Ribs</b> with flour.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan heat <b>OIL</b>. Fry <b>Pork Ribs</b> 
    turning frequently until nicely browned on all sides. A 5 quart 
    saut&eacute; pan will fry all the ribs at once, but if using a 3-1/2 
    quart, fry in two batches with 1 T oil in each batch.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry tumbling until onions are translucent. If 
    frying ribs in two batches finish each batch with half the onions.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock Mix</b>, bring to a boil, cover and simmer 20 to 
    30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Uncover pan and reduce at a high simmer until the sauce reaches the 
    consistency you desire. If serving with rice keep it fairly thin, 
    thicker if the pork will stand alone.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with sauce spooned over.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Country Style Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; These are generally 
  sold cut into thick strips which may be boneless and/or bone-in (the 
  bones will be odd shapes and random). The weight given here is for 
  boneless but before removing fat. If bone-in you'll need to start with 
  about 4 pounds. In either case you want to end up with about 2-3/4 
  pounds trimmed of bone and excess fat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cajun Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; A common seasoning mix 
  that you can easily make yourself by our recipe 
  <a href="6yv_cajuns1.html"><b>Cajun Seasoning</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Marmalade:</h3> &nbsp; The sauce given here is quite sweet. I 
  prefer a little more tart so I tend to use a bit more vinegar, but 
  you could also cut back on the amount of marmalade.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Either white or red will 
  work fine, but red will produce a darker sauce than pictured.</li>
