A meltingly tender roast in the style of Southeastern USA, with integrated 
mushroom sauce. This recipe can be used with either a Picnic Roast (as in 
photos) or a Pork Butt Roast, in either case, preferably bone-in and 
skin-on.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Peppercorns</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Thyme</b> together 
    into powder.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>BAY LEAVES</b> in half crosswise (<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>) 
    and slice each <b>GARLIC CLOVE</b> in thirds lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONIONS</b> and cut into slices about 1/4" thick.</li>
  <li>Rinse and dry <b>PORK SHOULDER</b>. Make 12 evenly spaced slits 
    through the skin into the meat about 1-1/2" deep by 1-1/4" wide. 
    Stuff some of the <b>Thyme Mix</b> into each slit until it is all 
    used up. Insert a <b>Bay Leaf half</b> into each slit, and then a 
    slice of <b>Garlic</b>.</li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Onion Slices</b> in a coverable roasting pan 
    (<a href="2mm_pigpicnic1.html#03"><b>Note-4</b></a>) just big enough for the Pork 
    Shoulder, but make sure you have extra headroom because the roast 
    will expand some. Place the <b>Pork Shoulder</b> on the onions, 
    pour in the <b>Wine</b> (<a href="2mm_pigpicnic1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>),</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 to 7 hrs, depending on size)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Cover the pan and slide it into the oven. Let it roast, 4 to 5 
    hours for an 8# shoulder, depending if you want it sliceable or 
    pullable, 5 to 6 hours for a 10# shoulder. Internal temperature 
    should reach at least 165&deg;F/75&deg;C, but these times should 
    certainly get you there.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> crosswise in half 
    if large, then the other way fairly thin.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium. Mix,</li>
  <li>Heat <b>BUTTER</b> and fry <b>Mushrooms</b> gently until they show 
    a touch of browning, then add <b>Shallot mix</b> and fry stirring for 
    another 5 minutes. Set aside until the roast is done.</li>
  <li>When roast is done: remove from oven and, <i>if the roast is 
    skin-on</i> turn up the oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C (see below).</li>
  <li>Remove roast from pan. Best way is to put on a pair of best quality 
    heavy rubber dishwashing gloves (size extra large). That'll give you 
    time to just reach in, grasp the roast and hoist it out onto your 
    cutting board.</li>
  <li>pull Bay Leaves. Cut through the skin at the narrowest part and 
    peel it away in as close to a single sheet as you can manage. Remove 
    excess fat from the roast and cover it with foil to rest for at 
    least 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Scrape excess fat from the skin, put the skin fat side down on a 
    sheet of foil. Roll the edges of the foil to contain released fat. 
    Slide the sheet into the oven and roast at 425&deg;F until a bit 
    crispy but still flexible.</li>
  <li>While the skin is roasting, pour the liquid from the roasting pan 
    through a strainer into a pan. Squeeze as much liquid out of the 
    onions as you can and discard the onions. Skim the fat or, better, 
    use a gravy separator to remove it.</li>
  <li>Add defatted roasting liquid to the <b>Mushroom mix</b> and bring 
    to a simmer. This is already an intense sauce so rather than boil it 
    down I prefer to thicken it just a little. Mix the cornstarch with a 
    little water and stir in. Simmer until thickened but you don't want 
    it thickened much.</li>
  <li>Add the <b>Cream</b> and bring to a simmer. Check for salt, it 
    may not need any, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep 
    warm.</li>
  <li>Cut the crispy skin into 1/2" wide strips. Slice the pork roast and 
    serve with some sauce and a slice of the skin, with rice or potatoes 
    on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bay Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; If yours are small use one per cut. I use 
  fresh bay leaves (because I have the trees) which stuff into the slots 
  easily, but most cooks have to use dried.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Wine:</h3> &nbsp; You can use Marsalla, Tawny Port or a deep Red 
  Wine, or a mix of Red Wine and Port or Marsalla. I generally use 1/2 
  Marsalla and 1/2 Merlot or Petite Sirah.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I use fresh Shiitakes, 
  sometimes mixed with some Oyster Mushrooms or regular mushrooms but 
  any mix of regular, wild, shiitake or other mushrooms will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Roasting Pan:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have a coverable roasting 
  pan the right size, drape a sheet of parchment paper over the pork, 
  then wrap the entire pan with aluminum foil, but not too tight because 
  the roast will expand some.</li>
