In the American South, this dish is often eaten on New Years Day, and 
reputed to bring good luck. Some say you must eat 365 beans to have good 
luck every day of the year, but if you eat 368 you will have three days 
of bad luck (2 in leap years).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 7 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACKEYES</b> in water with 1/2 T <b>Salt</b> for 8 hours 
    or overnight. Yes, salt (see our <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html">
    <b>Soaking / Brining Beans</b></a> page.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  </ol> 
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a saucepan, place <b>HAM HOCK</b>
    and 4-1/2 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 to 
    3-1/2 hours, or until the bones can easily be removed.</li>
  <li>Remove the hock. Strip out the bones and discard. Dice the meat 
    fairly small.  Place the <b>Meat</b> and <b>Cooking Liquid</b> into 
    a saucepan big enough for the whole recipe.</li> 
  <li>Drain and rinse the <b>Blackeyes</b>. Add them to the pot along 
    with <b>Onions</b> and <b>Chilis</b>. Bring to a boil, turn the heat 
    down, cover tightly and simmer slowly until beans are tender but 
    not mushy, around 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Now comes the tricky part. The amount of water I call for is 
    probably just a little short, because too little water can easily be 
    corrected, and too much is disaster. Bring some water to a boil as 
    you will probably need some. Stir in <b>Rice</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer over very 
    low heat for about 10 minutes. Check if it is too dry to completely 
    cook the rice. If so, add a little boiling water and stir. Cover 
    tightly and let simmer another 10 minutes, checking once more if 
    you need to.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat, and, without lifting the lid, let rest for 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning. Serve with Greens and Corn Bread.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Blackeye Peas:</h3> &nbsp;  These are now much 
  used in the American South, but the dish may have originally been 
  made with Pigeon Peas. Both Blackeye Peas and Pigeon Peas were brought 
  from Africa.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ham Hocks, Smoked:</h3> &nbsp; Smoked hocks are 
  easily available in most of North America. Some recipes call for 
  Hog Jowl, but I consider that way too fatty, and it's not so widely 
  available anyway.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Originally this was Carolina 
  rice, which was a major crop in the Carolinas. It is no longer grown 
  there because methods were completely dependent on slavery. Real 
  Carolina rice is now available from a boutique grower in the Carolinas, 
  but I just use Thai Jasmine rice which I always have on hand.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Southern Greens:</h3> &nbsp; For details, see 
  our recipe <a href="2sv_greens1.html"><b>Southern Greens</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Corn Bread:</h3> &nbsp; This is the bread of 
  the Deep South. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="2ev_cornbread1.html"><b>Corn Bread</b></a>.</li>
