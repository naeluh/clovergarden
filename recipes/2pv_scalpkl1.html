I have always had a problem with Scallions - I often need very fresh 
greens, but the greens aren't fresh for long, so I buy more. I wanted 
a solution other than tossing them, and found this pickle. It's really 
good, if the greens are good up to where they spread out.

  <p>The amounts given here are sufficient for a 4 cup jar.</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1+ days - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut root ends from <b>SCALLIONS</b>, peel off any damaged outer 
    layer, and trim tops to fit your jar (see <a href="2pv_scalpkl1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Pickle mix</b> to a boil, then set aside to cool until 
    just sort of hot.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Scallions</b> into your jar. They should make a tight 
    fit at the bottom.</li>
  <li>Add all <b>Spicing items</b> to the jar - push some Scallions 
    aside for this.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Pickle mix</b>, leaving about 3/4 inch headroom. 
    Check in a few minutes to see if it needs a bit more, then 
    screw on lid. I have a collection of plastic spacer grids from 
    Asian sauces and use one to hold the Scallions down.</li>
  <li>Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. They will be 
    edible in one day, but are best with at least 2 days age. They 
    will last about 4 weeks in the fridge.</li>
  <li>when serving, I usually cut them crosswise in half.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Scallions:</h3> &nbsp; The quantity you need is 
  just enough to fill your jar after trimming bottoms and tops and 
  peeling off damaged outer layer. This will be about 30 medium for a 
  3 cup jar.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for White Vinegar, 
  but others can be used. I usually use one of the flavorful Philippine 
  vinegars, Palm, Cane, Coconut, etc. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Vinegars &amp; Souring Agents</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; How much and how hot a flake you use is 
  completely up to you. Korean flake is rather mild, and won't be 
  offensive in this quantity, even to folks from the Frozen North. 
  Personally, I'd use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti which are a bit 
  hotter.</li>
