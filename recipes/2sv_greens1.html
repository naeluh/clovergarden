A recipe was established by African slaves in the United States Deep 
South, based on West African practice. The liquid, called "pot likker", 
is an essential part of the recipe, served with the greens, and is good 
for dipping corn bread.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>GREENS</b> to make sure there is no grit. Tear the 
    leaves into shreds. Throw the the stems and overly thick leaf ribs 
    out in the yard for the chickens.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HOG JOWL</b> into pieces about 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/4 inches 
    (or bacon similarly). For this recipe you can leave the skin on.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr (or more))
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan or wok, place 
    <b>Hog Jowl</b> and 1/4 cup <b>Water</b>. Boil off the water (which 
    will render enough fat to start frying). Fry until fat is translucent 
    and partially rendered but chunks are only a little browned.</li>
  <li>Pour off excess fat - but not too much - much of the flavor is 
    in the fat. With hog jowl you will probably have a little more than 
    you want, with bacon you will be lucky to have enough.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Greens</b> until wilted and coated with oil, then 
    stir in <b>Seasoning items</b> and <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until greens are tender. This 
    can be as little as 45 minutes or as long as 2 hours depending on 
    the greens. Collards take longest. Stir now and then.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, with plenty of the "pot likker" and Corn Bread.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Greens may be Collards, Turnip Greens, a mix 
  of Mustard Greens and Turnip Greens, or Kale. Southern Collards take 
  much longer to cook than the others, they are from Scotland where a 
  green plant has to be really tough to survive. African "Collards" 
  are much like Kale and cook much more quickly. The photo example was 
  done with turnip greens.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hog Jowl:</h3> &nbsp; This should be well smoked 
  hog jowl. If you can't get it, use a really good smoked bacon, 
  preferably "ends and pieces". See that it is reasonably fatty. for 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_jowlz.html"><b>Hog Jowls</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cajun Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; Much used in the 
  Deep South, this seasoning is fairly salty. For details see our 
  recipe <a href="6yv_cajuns1.html"><b>Cajun Seasoning</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; I usually use Korean 
  flake, easily available around here. You could crush any dried red 
  chili of your choice. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Corn Bread:</h3> &nbsp; This is the bread of the 
  South, and is good for soaking up the "pot likker". For details see 
  our recipe <a href="2ev_cornbread1.html"><b>Cornbread</b></a>.</li>
