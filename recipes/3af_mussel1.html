OK, the recipe says "serves 2 appetizer", but not if you can get away with 
eating them all yourself. Maybe you should start with a triple recipe for 
two - as an appetizer.

  <li>Debeard the <b>MUSSELS</b> and scrub thoroughly (if using live).</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and slice thin.</li>
  <li>Put <b>White Wine</b>, <b>Tomato Clam Juice Cocktail</b>, <b>Garlic</b> 
    and <b>Red Pepper Flakes</b> in a deep pot of sufficient size to easily 
    hold all the mussels and bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Add <b>MUSSELS</b> and bring back to a boil. Cook until the  mussels 
    have opened (discard any that don't open), remove them and keep them 
    warm.</li>
  <li>Remove the top half of the mussel shells and arrange the bottom half 
    on a serving platter. Keep warm until the sauce is ready.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Liquid</b> into a small saucepan, add the 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and <b>Black Pepper</b> and simmer down to about 
    one third.</li>
  <li>Distribute a generous spoonful of sauce among the shells and serve.</li>
  <li><b>NOTE:</b> you're going to have a lot of sauce left over - <b>do 
    not discard</b>. Use it as a dipping sauce for something, add it to 
    your next pasta sauce, put it on your breakfast scrambled eggs or 
    whatever you think of.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li  id="01">
  <h3>Mussels:</h3> &nbsp; 6 large should be somewhat 
  over 1 pound. On the other hand, the Asian markets around here are 
  well stocked with packages of frozen New Zealand mussels "on the half 
  shell", much more convenient and dependable, and more economical as 
  well.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Clam Juice Cocktail</h3> &nbsp; There are 
  several brands and you should be able to find at least in any reasonably 
  stocked supermarket. "Clamato" is probably the most widely 
  distributed.</li>
