A more or less traditional Muskrat Stew, and delicious. Muskrat is 
available frozen, but still requires special preparation steps. 
Failure to follow these steps makes for a very unpleasant dining 
experience.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (11 hrs - 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol> 
  <li>You will need to start this recipe at least a day ahead. Prepare 
    your <b>MUSKRAT</b> as described on our 
    <a href="../ingred/ar_muskratz.html"><b>Muskrat</b></a> page, 
    including cutting into chunks. See <a href="3mm_muskrat1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> 
    for additional hints.</li>  
  </ol>  
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>Potatoes</b> and cut into about 1 inch chunks. Hold in 
    cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONIONS</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> from a 28 oz can coarse. Add enough of their 
    juice to make up 2 cups.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>CORN</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a pot, set 5-1/2 cups <b>Water</b> to come to a boil while 
    frying the Muskrat.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Flour</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Roll 
    <b>Muskrat</b> chunks in flour until lightly coated.</li>
  <li>In a spacious skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Fat</b> or 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Muskrat</b> chunks over moderate heat, 
    tumbling now  and then until lightly browned all over. Be careful 
    the crumbs of flour do not burn, they should be reddish, not 
    chocolate.</li>
  <li>Stir fried <b>Muskrat</b>, into the boiling water, leaving as 
    much oil behind as you can, but do include as much of the crumbs as 
    you can, as they will thicken the stew. Stir in the <b>Onions</b>, 
    <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Cayenne</b>. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 
    2-1/4 hours.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Corn</b>. Bring back to a boil 
    and simmer another 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer another 
    45 minutes. Monitor thickness of the stew, keeping in mind it will 
    be a noticeably thicker when cooled below a simmer. Add boiling 
    water or boil uncovered as needed.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot. See also <a href="3mm_muskrat1.html#04">

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Muskrat:</h3> &nbsp; As purchased, skinned, 
  cleaned and head-on, the Muskrat should weigh at least 1-3/4 pounds.  
  It requires very special preparation, so follow instruction on our 
  <a href="../ingred/ar_muskratz.html"><b>Muskrat</b></a> page 
  completely and exactly or suffer the consequences. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar are good here. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes as they will disintegrate into mush with the 
  long cooking required here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fat/Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes use bacon drippings, salt pork 
  or lard, but a good high temperature oil can be used - Avocado, or 
  Pure Olive (not Virgin). I use home rendered lard, far superior to 
  store bought and very easy to make. Some recipes call for butter, but 
  that has a low smoke point and takes excessive attention while frying. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/oilsw.html">
  <b>Cooking with Oils and Fats</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; First, this is not a "white tablecloth" sort 
  of dish. You eat the stew with a spoon, but the chunks of meat you 
  will have to handle with your fingers. Provide dishes to receive bones, 
  and plenty of paper napkins. Do not be daunted by the detailed 
  instructions here and on our Muskrat page - it just isn't all that 
  hard, and the hard work is all done ahead. This stew goes extremely 
  well with a dark red wine such as Pinot Noir.</li>
