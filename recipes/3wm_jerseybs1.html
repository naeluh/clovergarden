For this, perhaps the most famous <a href="../ingred/sg_njprz.html">
<b>Jersey Pork Roll</b></a> recipe, I found descriptions but no 
photo (2007). This is my take on it, but I spent much of my childhood 
on a farm in New Jersey so I'm calling it "authentic".

  <b><u>Application Notes</u></b>
  <ul>
  <li>This is not "California cuisine" - it's, umm, "substantial", so if 
    you're not a steel worker or the like you probably won't want to try 
    to eat more than one at a sitting.</li>
  <li>Making this sandwich takes a bit of practice. Your first attempts 
    will surely be edible but may not look as nice as you'd like.</li>
  <li>A practiced Jersey fry cook would scoff at my frying the pork roll 
    and egg separately, but I don't expect I'll ever get that much 
    practice, so I play it safe.</li>
  <li>Slices from a block of Velveeta were too small and didn't melt well 
    but Kraft American Cheese Individual Slices worked fine.</li>
  <li>The photo sandwich is cut in half for clarity, but you 
     probably don't want to do that - it's messy.
     </li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your broiler.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK ROLL</b> to the thickness desired, around 1/8 inch is 
    good, two or three slices per sandwich as desired. Incise them from 
    the edges as shown (fireman's badge) or they'll bulge up in the 
    middle and not fry well.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>KAISER ROLL</b> ("Hard Roll" in NJ) into top and bottom 
    halves but put it back together so it won't dry out. Unwrap the slices 
    of <b>CHEESE</b> so they are ready.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> and fry <b>Pork Roll</b> until lightly browned. 
    Don't over-fry or it'll shrink a lot and dry out badly. When done, 
    remove from pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>EGG</b> "over easy" or "over medium" as you prefer - "over hard" 
    is too dry. While the egg is frying set your <b>Pork Roll</b> 
    slices on the lower half of the <b>Kaiser Roll</b>.</li>
  <li>When egg is done, set it on top of the Pork Roll slices. Top with 
    2 slices of <b>Cheese</b> and slip under the broiler. Check often, 
    the cheese should be well softened but not too runny or it'll drip right 
    off.</li>
  <li>Pull sandwich from the broiler, place the top of the Kaiser Roll on 
    top and you're ready to serve!</li>
  </ol>

  <b>Jersey Pork Roll:</b> &nbsp; This is available 
  on-line from several sources that ship all over North America, because 
  many Jersey expatriots crave it. For details see our

  <b>Lard:</b> &nbsp; You're eating Jersey Pork Roll and you're worried 
  about the health effects of lard? Give me a break! In seriousness 
  though, lard has a better health profile than butter, but you can use 
  oil if you must.</li>
