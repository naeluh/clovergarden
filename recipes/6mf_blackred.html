This Cajun classic had its 15 minutes of fame in the late 1980s, 
resulting in a serious depletion of redfish (Red Drum). Asian fish 
farmers immediately started producing Red Drum, and the wild stock has 
recovered.
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
This is not a difficult recipe to do and definitely worth the effort, 
but, <b>WARNING:</b> frying will produce a fair amount of chili laden 
smoke, so you need a decently ventilated location.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 to 45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scale, clean and fillet <b>REDFISH</b>. Skin if desired (most do).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Trim <b>FISH FILETS</b>, cutting off the thin skirt and the thin 
    part at the tail to make fillets fairly uniform in thickness.</li>
  <li>Make the seasoning by grinding all <b>Seasoning items</b> very fine 
    and mixing all together.</li>
  <li>Select a cast iron frying pan and clean it well. Use Comet Cleanser 
    or an even stronger institutional cleanser - don't worry about your 
    precious seasoning - this pan'll be seasoned like the fry pans of 
    Hell when you're through here.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Lemon Wedges</b> and melt additional <b>Butter</b> for 
    serving.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan melt butter and keep warm but not hot.</li>
  <li>Heat your serving plates in a 200&deg;F oven.</li>
  <li>Heat your dry cast iron frying pan extremely hot on your hottest 
    burner or over hot coals. It should be well beyond the smoking point 
    of any cooking oil known to man, higher than 525&deg;F/275&deg;C or 
    so.</li>
  <li>Working with just so many <b>Fish Fillets</b> as will fit in your 
    frying pan without crowding, dip them both sides in the warm butter, 
    sprinkle both sides liberally with seasoning and pat it in gently with 
    your fingers.</li>
  <li>Slip the fillets into the super-hot frying pan. Ladle 1 t 
    <b>Butter</b> on top of each (being careful of flare-ups). Fry about 
    1-1/2 to 2 minutes on the first side until the bottom is blackened, 
    then flip to the other side, ladle on 1 t <b>Butter</b> and fry 
    1-1/2 to 2 minutes until that side is blackened.</li>
  <li>Turn out on hot plates and serve at once with lemon wedges and 
    additional melted butter.</li>
  <li>If you're doing more than one batch take a big wad of paper towels 
    and wipe the pan very clean before starting the next batch, being 
    careful not to saut&eacute; your fingers.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Redfish:</h3> &nbsp; "Redfish" is 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_drumrz.html"><b>Red Drum</b></a>. not Red Snapper 
  as many people think. Most Red Drums are not actually red, but silver. 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html"><b>Pompano</b></a> is considered an 
  acceptable alternative, and a few people do use Red Snapper. The 
  fillets should be about 1/2" thick. Some fry the drum fillets 
  skin-on starting skin-side up but most do not.</li>
