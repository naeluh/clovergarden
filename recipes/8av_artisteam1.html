Artichokes are a favorite vegetable here in California, where nearly 
every fresh artichoke in North America is grown. They are still rather 
seasonal, price-wise, but are now available all year.

  <b><u>Application Notes</u></b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; Artichokes can be boiled, but they tend 
    to get a bit waterlogged, so I prefer steaming.</li>
  <li><b>Cutting:</b> &nbsp; Don't cut artichokes with a carbon steel 
    knife, it will not only discolor them but affect the flavor. Use 
    stainless or ceramic knives only.</li>
  <li><b>Color:</b> &nbsp; If you cut artichokes you need to have a bowl 
    of acidulated water (citric acid or lemon juice). Plunge them into 
    it immediately they are cut to prevent discoloring.</li>
  </ul>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min to 1-1/3 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare the <b>ARTICHOKES</b> for steaming. If the variety you have 
    is a thorny one, cut off about an inch at the tip and then use kitchen 
    shears to cut just the tip off each leaf. Thornless varieties need 
    no preparation unless they are so large they need to be split in 
    half. <b>Note:</b> don't cut the stems short, particularly if you 
    are boiling rather than steaming - the artichoke will become watery.
    </li>
  <li>Set <b>Artichokes</b> in your steamer. If cut in half, cut side down 
    if possible. Make sure the steamer has plenty of water.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil, then turn heat down enough to maintain a medium 
    boil and steam until done.</li>
  <li>While the artichokes are steaming, prepare your sauce.</li>
  <li>Artichokes should be done in 3/4 hour to 1-1/4 hour depending on 
    size and whether cut in half. To determine if they are done, try to 
    gently tug out a large leaf (use tongs). When a gentle tug pulls the 
    leaf out the artichoke is done. Leaves of the two outside bottom 
    ranks will never pull easily, or be edible.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately. If serving whole artichokes, trim the stem and 
    set them upright in a small bowl - if half artichokes, serve as in 
    the photo. In any case, you will need sauce and preferably a 
    cocktail spoon to scrape out the choke (fuzzy stuff).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Artichokes:</h3> &nbsp; For a light lunch, one 
  medium artichoke (green globe, for instance) will do for each person, 
  or, if you have very large artichokes (Lyon, for instance) you may want 
  to split it in half before steaming and serve half to each person (as 
  in the photo). For a light appetizer a half green globe is just fine. For 
  more on artichokes see our 
  <a href="../ingred/dy_thistle.html"><b>Thistles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sauce / Dip:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a very simple 
  dip of 1/4 cup each: Lemon Juice, White Wine, and Butter - herbs 
  optional, and a little salt if using unsalted butter. The French, of 
  course, prefer a thick, often mayonnaise based sauce where the sauce 
  is the feature and you can hardly taste the artichoke. The Italians 
  and Greeks lean more my way.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fancy Recipes:</h3> &nbsp; Some people, 
  particularly chefs, insist on coming up with all kinds of recipes 
  for stuffed artichokes and other complex creations. Perhaps this is 
  because artichokes are expensive in many regions, but I think chefs 
  are just allergic to plain. In my opinion this is all a major waste 
  of time - with artichokes simple is better.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chokes:</h3> &nbsp; This is the fuzzy seed layer 
  over the heart. Many recipes call for opening the artichoke and 
  spooning out the choke. This is necessary if you're going to stuff 
  it, but I feel stuffing them is a distraction. You can spoon off the 
  choke when you're done with the leaves, but I just pull out tufts 
  of the choke, dip the seed ends in the sauce and bite off the nutritious 
  seeds before disposing of the fuzz. Yes, this may seem a little 
  barbaric, but that's just the way I am. I paid for those seeds and 
  I'm not going to throw them out.</li>
