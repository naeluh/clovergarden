A moderately hot sauce popular in New Mexico, often  as a marinade for 
meats. "Chili Caribe" means "Crushed Chili", so a Caribe Sauce is by 
nature a bit coarse and rustic.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>New Mexico Chili:</h3> &nbsp; (or California Chili). 1-1/2 cups 
  was made from 12 chilis, weighing 2.8 ounces, and yielding 2.0 ounces. 
  These were fresh and leathery. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mexican Oregano</h3> &nbsp; This is "official", but can be hard to 
  find even here in Los Angeles (I suspect absolutely impossible in 
  Detroit). If you can't get it use regular dried oregano (the two are 
  not at all related, but the taste is similar).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Straining:</h3> &nbsp; Some people try to make this rustic sauce 
  smoother by straining out the flakes of chili skin and seeds. This is 
  messy and difficult, it doesn't strain easily, and straining violates 
  the nature of the sauce - best to leave it as is.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some people bake the chilis for about 
  20 minutes at 250&deg;F/120&deg;C, which will make them more crumbly, 
  and with some change in flavor.</li>
