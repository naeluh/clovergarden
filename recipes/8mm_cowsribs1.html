This recipe is adapted from a dolled up version developed by a haute chef 
at an up-scale dude ranch in Colorado. Oh well, here in Southern Cal we 
even eat quiche with impunity, so a little dandified cowboy fare won't hurt 
us any.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 days)
  <ol>
  <li>Salt <b>SHORT RIBS</b> liberally and refrigerate for from 1 to 3 
    days.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; ()
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters, cut <b>CARROTS</b> into 3/4 inch 
    chunks, mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and crush lightly.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>CHILIS</b> and break in half. Dump out as many seeds as will 
    dump.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Let <b>Short Ribs</b> come to room temperature, wipe dry, sprinkle 
    with <b>Pepper</b>, coat lightly with <b>Flour</b> and shake off 
    excess.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a large Dutch oven and fry <b>Short Ribs</b> in 
    batches over medium heat until lightly browned on all sides. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onion mix</b> to Oil and fry over moderate heat stirring often 
    until the vegetables start to caramelize, Stir in <b>Garlic Cloves</b> 
    and fry stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and then <b>Short Ribs</b>. Stir in 
    <b>All Sauce Items</b>. Bring back to a boil.</li>
  <li>Cover tightly and place in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Remove from the oven. Remove <b>Short Ribs</b> from the pot, brush 
    off any clinging debris and set aside. Strain the liquid through a 
    fine strainer, squeezing the vegetables to recover as much liquid as 
    possible. Send the debris out for compost.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot, defat <b>Liquid</b> using your gravy separator and 
    return it to the pot. Simmer the liquid with the lid off to thicken 
    if necessary, depending on what you intend to use it for.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Short Ribs</b> to the pot long enough to thoroughly 
    reheat. Serve them warm with a little of the liquid ladled over. Use 
    the rest of the liquid as sauce for roasted vegetables or other side 
    dishes.</li>
  <li>This dish is also delicious scraped from the bones and sliced cold 
    as an appetizer.</li>
