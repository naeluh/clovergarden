Pork stewed in a <i>caribe</i> sauce of mild red chilis - very 
popular in New Mexico and variously made. The recipe is easily doubled, 
reheats very well, and can be extended with potatoes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into strips about 2 x 1 x 1/2 inch, or into cubes 
    about 1-1/2 inch or however you prefer.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b> and crumble fairly fine, seeds and all. If they 
    are leathery, cut them into shreds with kitchen shears.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Add to Chilis, along with 
    <b>Oregano</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>In a sauce pan bring <b>Chili mix</b> to a boil and simmer slowly 
    about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>If required or desired (this will depend a lot on the initial 
    condition of the chilis), run <b>Sauce</b> in a mini-prep food 
    processor or similar to the desired texture.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Sauce</b> into the <b>Pork</b>. Marinate overnight in 
    the refrigerator (see <a href="8mm_pigadov1.html#04"><b>Marinating</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs or more)
  <ol start="7">
  <li><u>If</u> Using: &nbsp; Preheat oven to 300&deg;F/150&deg;C. 
    (or see <a href="8mm_pigadov1.html#05"><b>Cooking</b></a>).</li> 
  <li>Arrange <b>Pork</b> in its cooking container and cook until Pork 
    is almost falling apart - see <a href ="8mm_pigadov1.html#05"><b>Cooking</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of warm tortillas - or steamed rice, or potatoes, 
    or neeps and tatties, chapatis, lavash, pita, naan, or whatever you 
    have. In the multi-ethnic Southwest - there are no rules.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless and all excess fat removed. 
  Butt, shoulder or leg are all fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>New Mexico Chili:</h3> &nbsp; (or California Chili). 1-1/2 cups 
  was made from 12 chilis, weighing 2.8 ounces, and yielding 2.0 ounces. 
  These were fresh and leathery. Hotness of the finished dish is entirely 
  up to the batch of chilis you use, but is usually pretty mild. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mexican Oregano</h3> &nbsp; This is "official", but can be hard to 
  find even here in Los Angeles (I suspect absolutely impossible in 
  Detroit). If you can't get it use regular dried oregano (the two are 
  not at all related, but the taste is similar).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Marinating:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes all call for arranging it all in 
  the baking dish and then refrigerating overnight. I think this is 
  absurd and risky in a crowded fridge, especially when preparing for 
  guests. I heat seal it in a 2-mil poly bag and put that in the fridge. 
  The baking dish (see <a href="8mm_pigadov1.html#05"><b>Cooking</b></a>) can be filled 
  just before going into the oven.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes I've read all call for cooking in a 
  covered baking dish in the oven, but here in Southern California we 
  don't fire up an oven unless we really need to. I do it on the 
  stovetop, in a tri-ply saut&eacute; pan on a well regulated back 
  burner with a heat spreader - works perfectly and is done in 1-1/2 
  hours. Cooking in the oven takes about 2 hours. It could also be done 
  in a slow cooker, except one recipe is too small unless you have a 
  small 2 qt. cooker. For a double recipe I'd consider the slow cooker, 
  but, being impatient, I'd bring it to a boil on the stovetop, 
  then pour it in the slow cooker to finish. I suspect it'll still take 
  more than 2 hours, but it won't be taking up room on the stove, 
  important when preparing for parties.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; There is quite a bit of liquid in the 
  finished dish, very good for serving with rice. Otherwise, Potatoes, 
  cut to 1/2 inch dice are often added for the last half hour of cooking, 
  or they can be cooked separately and added a little before serving.</li>
