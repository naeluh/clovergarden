This quick pickle condiment is an excellent use for Swiss Chard Stems, 
which are so often discarded. It can be plain with white chard stems 
(which I always have far more than other colors) or colorful with red 
or rainbow stems.

  <ol>
  <li>Dice <b>CHARD STEMS</b> 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch, or into narrow 
    strips if you prefer.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOT</b>. Cut in half lengthwise, then thin crosswise.

  <li>Mix <b>Chard Stem mix</b> with <b>Salt</b> and let stand 20 
    minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Chard Stem mix</b> into an appropriate sized jar. Don't 
    rinse.</li>
  <li>In a small saucepan, fry <b>Mustard Seeds</b> until they just 
    start to pop - take care they don't burn - then stir in all 
    <b>Pickle items</b>. Bring to a boil and stir until Sugar has 
    dissolved.</li> 
  <li>Let brine cool a bit, then pour into jar with <b>Chard Stems</b>.
    </li> 
  <li>Let cool to room temperature. When cool, cover tightly and 
    refrigerate (also see <a href="8pv_chard1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). The Chard 
    Stems can be used after an overnight rest in the fridge. This 
    pickle will keep up to 1 month in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chard Stems:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is after dicing. 
  Any color can be used, white, red or rainbow. Note that the "Swiss" 
  in Swiss Chard is redundant, as Cardoons are no longer called "Chard". 
  Chard has never been much grown in Switzerland.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  called for Pink Peppercorns, which would be better, but my Pink 
  Peppercorn tree was out of season when I made this, so I used black 
  peppercorns.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Note that I have cut the 
  amount of Sugar to 1/3 what was called for in the pattern recipe, and 
  I'm fine with that. Use your own preference here. I favor Zulka's 
  Morena Pure Cane Sugar (product of Mexico) for it's light flavor 
  suggestive of Southeast Asian palm sugar. Other flavorful sugars can 
  be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Storing</h3> &nbsp; I have a collection of little 
  plastic spacer inserts from various jars of Asian pickles and preserves. 
  They are perfect for keeping stuff down under the brine - it's what 
  they were designed to do.</li>
