Delicious Stuffed Eggs by a recipe reflecting the substantial Korean 
influence here in Southern California. These will go over very well 
at parties.
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
For parties, I make them them a 
few hours ahead and refrigerate them in 7-1/2 x 8 inch plastic 
clamshells, which hold 12 each securely. I always make plenty of extras 
to bring out when the first round is gone, which happens quickly.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but 
  can be risky, especially in business friendly Red States, due to the 
  raw egg yolks. Second best is Hellmann's (east of the Mississippi) 
  or Best Foods (west of the Mississippi), as most food writers 
  agree.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kimchee:</h3> &nbsp; There are many kimchees, 
  but the one for this recipe is the common red Napa cabbage one. Please 
  note, supermarket kimchee in small jars is generally awful. Check a 
  Korean market for what they have fresh in half gallon jars. Buy one of 
  those brands in whatever size you prefer. You'll have plenty left over 
  from this recipe, just eat it - it's good for you. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ig_kimchee.html"><b>Kimchee</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Gochujang:</h3> &nbsp; This is the chili sauce 
  of Korea, made in a paste form. It is not real hot - you can eat it 
  with a spoon. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_gochujz.html"><b>Gochujang</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Toasted Sesame Seed:</h3> &nbsp; This is an 
  essential garnish and ingredient in Korea, Japan and all of Southeast 
  Asia. It is easily made by our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If your stuffing seems too 
  liquid, boil a few more eggs and add just the yolks to the mix. Thre 
  will be plenty of stuffing for those too.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Holding Stuffed Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Get a stack 
  of 8 x 8 inch clear plastic clamshells with hinged lids from a 
  restaurant supply (see <a href="pad_egstfm1x.html#clam">
  <b>Clamshell</b></a>). I get them from Smart &amp; Final. These will 
  neatly hold 12 stuffed egg halves per clamshell - but they are so 
  flimsy they invite disaster (trust me). Nest two clamshells. Arrange 
  the eggs, then close and snap the lid of the inner clamshell. use 
  scissors to cut off the lid of the outer clamshell (it won't snap 
  securely). Refrigerate level.</li>
