These simple fried smelts with a simple dip are a fine appetizer for people 
who like fish. Just dusted rather than battered doesn't mask their taste.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (20 to 55 min - see <a href="9af_smelt1.html#03"><b>Timing</b></a>)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>SMELTS</b> as desired (see <a href="9af_smelt1.html#01"><b>Smelts</b></a>). 
    Dry them on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Coating items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (about 25 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Set out a wire rack for draining the <b>Smelts</b> (see <a href="9af_smelt1.html#04">
    <b>Draining</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Place fish in a plastic bag, pour in the <b>Coating</b> and shake until 
    fish are evenly coated. Dump out into a wire strainer and shake it a bit 
    to remover excess flour.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, Wok or 
    deep Pan, heat enough <b>Oil</b> for deep frying, to about 370&deg;/
    188&deg;C. Keep it close to that temperature while frying.The Oil should 
    never smoke.</li>
  <li>Put as many <b>Smelts</b> as will fit loosely into your hot oil, perhaps 
    12 or 15, and  tumble them often. After a while, you will notice a sudden 
    decrease in the amount of bubbling. This indicates they are about cooked 
    through, so now you need only be concerned with color and crispness. 
    <u>Caution</u>: do not fry to the color you want because they will darken 
    significantly on the rack. Fish them out with your Spider when they have 
    taken just a little color.</li>
  <li>Serve fried <b>Smelts</b> immediately with the <b>Dip</b>. There is 
    still enough moisture in the fish to degrade the crispness fairly 
    quickly. They can be restored to crispness reasonably well in a 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven for 10 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Smelts:</h3> &nbsp; You'll probably be using frozen smelts as fresh are 
  not available in most regions. Smelts from the Great Lakes region were 
  traditionally eaten "Heads, guts, and feathers", but the Smelts we get 
  these days tend to be bitter if not gutted. Heads are fine, even up to 
  5-1/2 inch fish. For details see our <a href="gmf_fishtiny1.html">
  <b>Dealing with Tiny Fish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dip</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a simple dip that doesn't overwhelm the 
  fish. Shown is one made with just a fine Philippine vinegar, salt, 
  and a few slices of Habanero Chili floating in it. Southeast Asian dips 
  are also good. They, and many more dips will be found on our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/index.html#dress"><b>Recipes by Use</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Timing:</h3> &nbsp; How long this recipe takes depends on the size and 
  condition of the smelts when you buy them. It took me 35 minutes to gut 
  and rinse 14 oz (56 fish) small to tiny head-on smelts. Headless smelts, 
  (often partially cleaned) it would be little less. Larger smelts would 
  take a fair amount less time, fewer for the same weight.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Draining</h3> &nbsp; Drain on a wire rack or basket with a pan under 
  it, not paper towels. Paper towels get oil soaked quickly so the fish 
  will be relatively oily.</li>
