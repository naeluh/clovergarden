This excellent appetizer can be slice or cubed as you wish. Unlike 
many such recipes, this jellied loaf can be served to those who's God 
would smite them for eating delicious pig.

This is actually a northern Chinese Muslim stew "repurposed" (see 
<a href="cmm_cowvar1.html"><b>Beef Shank with Variety Meats</b></a>). 
The Beef Tendons are essential, so don't leave them out. For details 
see our <a href="../ingred/ab_cowc.html"><b>Beef / Veal Cuts by 
Chart</b></a> page.

  <b><u>Make</u></b>   &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 hrs + overnight + 6 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Place all <b>MEATS</b> (whole) in an 8 quart pot and fill it to 
    near the top with water. Bring it up to a full boil for about 4 
    minutes. I usually skim as it comes to a boil to reduce the pile of 
    sludge. Pour it all out into a clean sink. Wash the pot and rinse 
    the meats well, returning them to the pot.</li>
  <li>Add all <b>Flavoring items</b> to the pot and <b>Water</b> to 
    cover meats well. Bring to a boil and set to simmer for about 2 
    hours.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Beef Shank</b>. Leave the Tendons in. If 
    <b>Honeycomb Tripe</b> it can also come out, but blanket tripe 
    should stay in a little longer. If using <b>Lamb Heart</b> you 
    can pull it out now. If <b>Beef Heart</b> it'll need to stay 
    until the Tendons are pulled. Set pulled meats aside to cool. 
    Bring back to a boil and simmer another 45 minutes or until 
    tendons are tender enough. If any other meats have been left 
    in, pull them when they are tender enough.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Tendons</b> and add to the other meats. Place 
    cooled meats in the fridge and let chill overnight for easy slicing.
    </li>
  <li> Strain the <b>Broth</b> and defat it (use your gravy separator). 
    In a clean pot, reduce it at a medium boil until there's just enough 
    to saturate the cut meats, about 4 cups. Cool and refrigerate. Keep 
    it separate from the meats because it will jell stiff.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Meats</b> about 3/8 inch thick or as you like, and toss 
    to mix evenly.Reheat the broth until it is liquid and pour it in 
    with the cut meats.</li>
  <li>Package it as you like. I just pack it in plastic bags and 
    refrigerate them on a tray so they jell flat, but various molds 
    can be used. Best to line them with plastic film so the loaf will 
    come out easily. Refrigerate overnight or at least a few hours until 
    the gel sets firmly.</li>
  <li>For serving, slice or cube as desired. Cubes can have toothpicks 
    stuck in them for buffet service. Whatever shapes, they can be 
    accompanied with condiments like mustard or horseradish, but they 
    have enough flavor to stand alone.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Shank:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless 
  with all excess fat removed. Cooking time is long, so a tough cut 
  with lots of connective tissue is needed. Some Asian markets sell 
  whole shanks, which you bone yourself. This is better for slicing, 
  because the pieces are long, but regular cross cut center shanks 
  work well enough if fairly thick.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Tendons:</h3> &nbsp; This ingredient can commonly be found in 
  markets serving a Chinese or Philippine community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tendonz.html"><b>Beef Tendons</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; While the original Chinese recipe calls for 
  Honeycomb Tripe, I feel Blanket Tripe is better for this jellied loaf.  
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beef Heart:</h3>  &nbsp; Weight is after removal of fat and 
  plumbing. Lamb Hearts can be used if Beef Hearts aren't available, 
  but they need more trimming, so a little more weight.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  now again legal in the US so long as they are lightly toasted. These 
  are nothing at all like black pepper. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tangerine Peel:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Tangerine Peel is a common 
  ingredient in China. I dry my own. it can get very dark, almost black, 
  with age, and the Chinese perfer it dark.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Us a good drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  those horrid salted "cooking" grades. If you don't have Chinese rice 
  wine, use a Dry Sherry. Sake, though also made from rice, is not 
  considered an acceptable substitute, its beer, not wine. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
