<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Soybean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; These are available in Korean and some 
  other Asian markets. Just make sure they are fresh and keep refrigerated. 
  There is shrill outcry that these sprouts contain "anti nutrients", that's 
  irrelevant for an occasional salad, and cooking reduces them anyway.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a fine Korean flake, which is 
  (usually) only moderately hot. 3/4 teaspoon should be fine for most people, 
  though I'd use at least a teaspoon for myself. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Back Story:</h3> &nbsp; Every once in a while, I find I have bought a 
  bag of Soybean Sprouts, but didn't use them as I had expected, and they 
  won't last. So, I came up with this recipe, similar to Korean, but using my 
  California Fusion Dressing. As with any very simple dish, quality of the 
  ingredients is paramount. My favorite rice vinegar is Kong Yen Foods 
  Aged (unseasoned) from Taiwan.</li>
