<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Persian Cukes, or some other 
  unwaxed variety that doesn't need peeling or seeding (Japanese, European, 
  English, Korean). If all you have is the standard waxed blimps, you'll 
  have to peel them, and maybe seed them. Weight would be after peeling 
  and seeding.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a fine Korean flake, which is 
  (usually) only moderately hot. 3/4 teaspoon should be fine for most people, 
  though I'd use at least a teaspoon for myself. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Back Story:</h3> &nbsp; I had completed a very fine Korean Radish 
  Salad. It used quite a bit of Fish Sauce, and I wanted to include a 
  vegetarian option. I decided on half Aged Rice Vinegar and half 
  Soy Sauce.  I decided to try it on some Persian Cucumbers I had on hand, 
  and included two other ingredients from the Korean salad: Dark Sesame Oil 
  and Korean Chili Flake. It took me only seconds to decide this was my 
  favorite cucumber salad ever. As with any very simple dish, quality of 
  the ingredients is paramount. My favorite rice vinegar is Kong Yen Foods 
  Aged (unseasoned) from Taiwan.</li>
