  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 to 20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>DRESSING</b> of choice. Vinaigrettes are best for this kind 
    of salad. See our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/index.html#dresss"><b>Salad Dressings</b></a> 
    list.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b> into about 1-1/2 inch lengths, then cut those in 
     half lengthwise. Cut the pieces lengthwise into sticks. (see 
     <a href="9gv_salmix1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Peel <b>RADISH</b> and cut into 1-1/2 inch sticks to match the Cukes. 
     If regular Red Radishes, just slice fairly thick.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>TOMATOES</b> into wedges depending on size and your 
    preference. If tiny Grape Tomatoes, just cut in half. If larger 
    Cherry Tomatoes, cut in half, then cut the halves in half.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PEPPERS</b> into strips of similar size to the Cukes. How will 
    depend on the size of your Peppers.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> starting at the green end 1-1/2 inches long, 
    getting shorter as you go to the white end, ending in 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise, then slice crosswise fairly thin.</li>
  <li>If <b>MUSHROOMS</b> are large, cut in half one way, then about 1/8 inch 
    thick at right angles, or if small, just slice.</li>
  <li>Tear or cut <b>LETTUCE</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 to 2 square inches 
    in size.</li>
  <li>Pull leaves of <b>Herbs</b> from the stems and leave whole. Some Mints 
    can have very large leaves which can be cut in half.</li>
  <li>Tumble together <b>ALL Items</b> <u>except</u> Tomatoes and Dressing.
    until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Gently tumble in <b>Tomatoes</b> until well distributed.
  <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve (see <a href="9gv_salmix1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>).
    Bagged in plastic and refrigerated, this salad (undressed) will still be 
    fine the next day.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Persian or other varieties 
  that don't need to be peeled or seeded (Japanese, European, English) are 
  preferable. If all you have is the regular waxed green blimps, weight 
  given is after peeling and seeding them.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Radish:</h3> &nbsp; I use Daikon Radish (Japanese or Korean) which 
  can be cut into sticks similar to the cucumber. If regular Red Radishes 
  are what you have, they can be used, sliced a bit thick.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The peppers used for the photo example were three 
  colors of "Mini Sweet Peppers" which I rather like, but Red or Green 
  Anaheims will work well, or any color Bell Peppers. Of course, there's 
  nothing stopping you from adding some moderately hot peppers too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms are fine for salads. Do 
  not use Oyster Mushrooms, which are bitter when raw.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; Use plenty. Americans and Europeans are timid with 
  herbs, while in Anatolia, Caucasus, and the Levant, they are treated almost 
  like vegetables. Suitable are Parsley (flat leaf only), Cilantro, Mint, 
  Celery Leaf. The one you should use timidly is Tarragon.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Dressing:</h3> &nbsp;  Vinaigrette type dressing is best for this kind 
  of salad.  For suggestions, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/index.html#dresss"><b>Salad Dressings</b></a> list.
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Keep your dressing in a small jar that you can 
  shake up vigorously before applying to the salad. Apply dressing only to 
  portions being served - the Oil in dressings will quickly wilt the lettuce. 
  For individual servings, it is good to take out some of the lettuce and 
  line the bowls with it, as the heavier items tend to sink to the bottom. 
  For Buffet serving, you definitely want to put a lot of the lettuce in the 
  bottom of the bowl. It is also best to have a container of dressing (a lot 
  more than if you had control of it). Provide a <u>small</u> ladle in the 
  dressing. I emphasize small because if it is large, some yoyo will ladle 
  most of the dressing onto his/her salad, leaving little for anyone else.
  </li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Practice:</h3> &nbsp; These are principles for making a delicious 
  mixed salad.
  <ul>
  <li>The list of ingredients here is my favorite, but you can definitely 
    make your own choices, but no ingredient should be so strong (or so much 
    of it) that it dominates.</li>
  <li>Every ingredient should be cut to a large enough size that it can 
    be appreciated for its own unique flavor and texture.</li>
  <li>All ingredients must be very fresh.</li>
  <li>Do not apply dressings until about to serve, as the oil in dressings 
    will wilt the lettuce.</li>
  </ul></li>
