A fine light main course for three or a pasta course for five, I make 
this often to use small amounts of miscellaneous seafood that collect in 
my freezer compartment - but you don't need an excuse.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min (varies with seafood))
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>SEAFOOD MIX</b> as desired, but not too small - pieces should 
    be tasted individually.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ANCHOVIES</b> medium and add to <b>Seafood mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and cut into chunks about 1/2 inch on a side.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>MINT</b>. Mix.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>PARMESAN</b> and place in a small bowl.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Onion mix</b> 
    over moderate heat until translucent but not browned.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring over moderate 
    heat until softened and much of the liquid has evaporated. Don't 
    over-reduce or the fresh tomato flavor will be lost.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Wine</b> and simmer down until you have a light sauce 
    consistency (you need it liquid enough to cook the seafood). Cover and 
    keep warm until pasta is nearly ready. If making 
    ahead this is where to stop.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>Pasta</b> in plenty of salted water the usual way. When just 
    done, drain (but not too dry) and return to the pan. Mix with a few 
    drops of <b>Olive Oil</b> to keep it from sticking together.</li>
  <li>When Pasta is nearly done, turn up heat under the sauce and stir in 
    the <b>Seafood Mix</b>. Cook stirring until just cooked through - about 
    2 minutes. Watch the thick end of your shrimp to judge doneness. Keep 
    in mind that mollusks like squid, octopus and sea snails get tough and 
    rubbery with much more cooking than that.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Parsley mix</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>  
  <li>With tongs, load <b>Pasta</b> onto individual plates (preferably 
    warm ones). Ladle sauce over. Serve immediately. Set out the 
    <b>Parmesan</b> in its bowl with a small spoon for serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Seafood Mix:</h3> &nbsp; Suitable seafood mixes can 
  be found in the frozen food cases of many markets - or make your own. 
  any mix of Fish, small Octopus Tentacles, Squid Rings &amp; Tentacles, 
  Mussel Meat, Shrimp, Oyster Meat, Clam Meat, Periwinkle Meat and/or 
  Cuttlefish that you prefer (or have on hand).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Anchovies:</h3> &nbsp; Please use Spanish, Italian, or 
  South American anchovies. Moroccan anchovies (most in North America) 
  are so often disappointing. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_anchopd.html"><b>Anchovy Products</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer Linguini, but any stringy 
  pasta can be used, or non-stringy if you prefer.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>California:</h3> &nbsp; This state has a very strong Italian 
  heritage, to the point the Bank of America was originally the Bank of 
  Italy, and Zucchini was first popularized in Los Angeles. We make no 
  apologies for offering California dishes "in the Italian style".</li>
