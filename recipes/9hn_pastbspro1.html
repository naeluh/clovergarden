This recipe is absurdly simple, but with these flavors, who needs 
complexity? It's one of my favorite ways to use Brussels Sprouts -  
but other vegetables work very well too.

<p>Recipe is sized as lunch for two, or Italian pasta courses for four - but

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>VEGATABLE</b> - see <a href="9hn_pastbspro1.html#01"><b>Vegetables</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into pieces less than 1/4 inch thick and about 1/2 
    inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>ROMANO</b> or chop <b>PARSLEY</b> coarse for garnish (or mix 
    the two).</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Par Boil the 
    <b>Vegetable</b> for the time given in <a href="9hn_pastbspro1.html#01"><b>Vegetables</b></a>.  
    <u>Do not overcook</u>! Scoop them out and refresh with cold water.
    </li>
  <li>In an iron skillet fry <b>Bacon</b> over very low heat until just 
    starting to get crisp. Time it so it's done about when the pasta is 
    done.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp;  Cook <b>PASTA</b> the usual way in the same water 
    the Vegetable was cooked in. Take samples to check doneness 
    (see <a href="9hn_pastbspro1.html#04"><b>Al Dente</b></a>).</li>
  <li>When Pasta is just done, stir in <b> Vegetable</b> over high heat, 
    just long enough so they're heated through.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Pasta</b> and pour back into the pot. Pour in the 
    <b>Bacon</b> and its rendered fat. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b> (be generous with the Pepper).</li>
  <li>Serve hot and pass <b>Cheese</b> for sprinkling.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <b><u>10 ounces weight after 
  trimming</u></b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Brussels Sprouts:</b> &nbsp; Trim stems, pull off grungy outer leaves, 
    cut lengthwise into quarters, or halves if very small. Par boil will be 
    4 minutes, 5 minutes absolute max.</li>
  <li><b>Green Beans:</b> &nbsp; Trim stem end, tip if you desire, cut into 
    about 1-1/2 inch lengths. Par boil will be 4 to 5 minutes depending on 
    size and age.</li> 
  <li><b>Cauliflower:</b> &nbsp; Break into bite sized florets. Trim stems and 
    split larger stems for fast cooking. Par boil will be 5 minutes max.</li>
  <li><b>Peas, Frozen:</b> &nbsp; Just pour into a strainer and run some hot 
    water over them to thaw.</li>
  <li><b>Lima Beans, Frozen:</b> &nbsp; Pour into a strainer and run some hot 
    water over them to thaw.  Par boil for 3 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Asparagus:</b> &nbsp; Snap tough base ends off and cut each into 
    three sections, keeping the sections separate. First cut 2 inches of the 
    tip, then the next two inches. Over high heat, par boil the <b>Base 
    Group</b> for 1-1/2 minutes. Add the <b>Center Group</b> for another 1 
    minute. Add the <b>Tips group</b> and cook until all are tender. This 
    will be about another 4 minutes - 6-1/2 to 7 minutes total time. Scoop 
    out and refresh under cold water.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good Smoked Bacon purchased 
  unsliced (or bacon ends and pieces will often do). I've also made this 
  using smoked Hog Jowl, which is fattier than bacon, so I use a little 
  more and pour off some of the fat.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; Any good quality pasta that's shape and size 
  compatible with the Vegetable is fine. The photo example was made with 
  Penne Rigate and Brussels Sprouts.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Al Dente:</h3> &nbsp; Pasta is to be cooked "al dente" (to the tooth), 
  but opinions vary. Italians insist it must resist the bite in the center. 
  Greeks and Turks like it uniform all the way though, but not at all mushy. 
  Personally, I prefer it just a shade more even than the Italians, but 
  firmer than the Greeks. Most Americans badly overcook pasta, and that will 
  happen if you use the time on the package. There is no substitute for 
  sampling.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>California:</h3> &nbsp; This state has a very strong Italian 
  heritage, to the point the Bank of America was originally the Bank of 
  Italy, and Zucchini was first popularized in Los Angeles. We make no 
  apologies for offering California dishes "in the Italian style".</li>
