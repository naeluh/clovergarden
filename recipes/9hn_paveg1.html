This is my most common lunch, using vegetable on hand. Tasty, nutritious, 
very easy to make and to clean up after. As with other very simple dishes, 
quality of ingredients is important.

<p>Recipe is sized as a generous lunch for two, or Italian pasta courses for 
four or side dish for 5 - but it's very easy to double, or cut in half for 
a single serving.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>VEGATABLE</b> - see <a href="9hn_paveg1.html#01"><b>Vegetables</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>Garnish</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 5 min work)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Par Boil the 
    <b>Vegetable</b> for the time given in <a href="9hn_paveg1.html#01"><b>Vegetables</b></a>.  
    <u>Do not overcook</u>! Scoop them out and refresh with cold water.
    </li>
  <li>Cook <b>PASTA</b> the usual way in the same water the Vegetable was 
    cooked in. Take samples to check doneness (see <a href="9hn_paveg1.html#03">
    <b>Al Dente</b></a>).</li>
  <li>When Pasta is just done, stir in <b> Vegetable</b> over high heat, 
    just long enough so they're heated through.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Pasta</b> and pour back into the pot. Pour in your best 
    <b>Extra Virgin Olive oil</b>, can be up to 3/4 Tablespoon, then 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> to taste (be generous with the Pepper).</li>
  <li>Garnish and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <b><u>Weight is after trimming. 5 oz 
    would be OK too. Par Boil times start when the water comes back to a 
    boil over high heat.</u></b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Bell Pepper:</b> &nbsp; Cut into rectangles of moderate size. 
    Par boil Red for about 3 minutes, Green, about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Brussels Sprouts:</b> &nbsp; Trim stems, pull off grungy outer leaves, 
    cut lengthwise into quarters (or halves if very small). Par boil will be 
    4 minutes, 5 minutes absolute max.</li>
  <li><b>Cabbage</b> &nbsp; 5 oz would be good here because it's flavor is 
    not real strong. Cut into strips about 3/4 inch wide and 2 inches long. 
    Par boil for 4 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Celery:</b> &nbsp; Cut crosswise into about 3/4 inch lengths. Select 
    a Pasta that's large enough to match. Par boil about 6 minutes. If you 
    have Leaves, stir them in when you return the Stems to the pan.</li>
  <li><b>Green Beans:</b> &nbsp; Trim stem end, tip if you desire, cut into 
    about 1-1/2 inch lengths. Par boil will be 4 to 5 minutes depending on 
    size and age.</li> 
  <li><b>Cauliflower:</b> &nbsp; Break into bite sized florets. Trim stems and 
    split larger stems for fast cooking. Par boil will be 5 minutes max.</li>
  <li><b>Peas, Frozen:</b> &nbsp; Just pour into a strainer and run some hot 
    water over them to thaw.</li>
  <li><b>Lima Beans, Frozen:</b> &nbsp; Pour into a strainer and run some hot 
    water over them to thaw.  Par boil for 3 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Asparagus:</b> &nbsp; Snap tough base ends off and cut each into 
    three sections, keeping the sections separate. First cut 2 inches of the 
    tip, then cut the rest of the spears into about 1-1/2 inch lengths. Keep 
    the Tips, Center, and Ends separate. Over high heat, par boil the 
    <b>End Group</b> for 1-1/2 minutes. Add the <b>Center Group</b> for 
    another 1-1/ minutes, then the <b>Tips group</b> and cook until all are 
    tender. This  will be about another 4 minutes - about 7 minutes total 
    time. Scoop out and refresh under cold water.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; Any good quality pasta that's a shape and size 
  compatible with the Vegetable is fine. The photo example is with small 
  Macaroni and Green Beans.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Al Dente:</h3> &nbsp; Pasta is to be cooked "al dente" (to the tooth), 
  but opinions vary. Italians insist it must resist the bite in the center. 
  Greeks and Turks like it uniform all the way though, but not at all mushy. 
  Personally, I prefer it just a shade more even than the Italians, but 
  firmer than the Greeks. Most Americans badly overcook pasta, and that will 
  happen if you use the time on the package. There is no substitute for 
  sampling.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>California:</h3> &nbsp; This state has a very strong Italian heritage, 
  to the point the giant Bank of America was originally the Bank of Italy, 
  and Zucchini was first popularized in Los Angeles restaurants. We make no 
  apologies for offering California dishes "in the Italian style".</li>
