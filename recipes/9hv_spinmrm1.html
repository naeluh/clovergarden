Making an Italian recipe, <a href="yhv_spinmrm1.html"><b>Pasta with 
Spinach &amp; Mushrooms</b></a>, left me with a lot of spinach stems. I 
adapted the recipe to use the stems, and liked it better than the 
original. Spinach stems are sweeter than the leaves.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b> (probably already done before removing 
    the leaves).  Cut about 3 inches long, or as desired.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.  
    Crush <b>CHILI</b>. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>You can put your <b>Pasta</b> into the boiling salted water at this 
    point. When <i>al dente</i> drain, return to the (now empty) pot 
    and mix with a few drops of <b>Olive Oil</b> to keep it from sticking
    together.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Fry 
    <b>Onion</b> until translucent, then stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and 
    fry stirring until soft through, but far from dried out. How long 
    this takes will depend on what kind of mushrooms you use.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach</b> and fry stirring until well coated with oil 
    and starting to wilt.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>White Wine</b> and <b>Thyme</b>. Simmer until Stems are 
    tender but not mushy. Uncover as needed to reduce the wine, but not 
    too dry.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Lemon Juice</b> and immediately take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot over (or mixed with) <b>Pasta</b></li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach Stems:</h3> &nbsp; 10 ounces is about 
  what you can expect from 1-3/4 pounds of good quality spinach. If 
  you're short on stems, feel free to mix in some torn up leaves.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp;  The photo example was 
  made with a mix of Crab Mushrooms (which look just like the pasta) 
  and White Mushrooms, which is what I had on hand, but criminis, 
  portabellas, king trumpets, and oyster mushrooms are also suitable.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Hey, it wouldn't be California 
  without a touch of heat, now would it? I use a small but very intense 
  Bird Chili, but use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chili Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thyme:</h3> &nbsp; Thyme is traditional with this sort of recipe, 
  but use whatever herb you would like, dry or fresh. For the photo 
  example I actually used dried oregano and it worked fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; I used Bucatini, broken into 
  thirds, for a good match with the spinach stems, but other shapes 
  could be used as well. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_itall.html"><b>Italian Long Pasta Shapes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
