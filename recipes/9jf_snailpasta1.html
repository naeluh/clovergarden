Apple Snails are pests in Hawaii, Florida and most other warm wet parts 
of the world, particularly in rice paddies. Eating the little bassards can 
help keep them under control. The main problem with Apple Snails is their 
toughness.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li><b>IF</b> using whole <b>SNAILS</b>, simmer or steam until they 
    release from their shells. Clean them and rinse. Use only the rubbery 
    foot part, the mealy stuff farther up in the shell doesn't taste very 
    good. 
    <br><b>IF</b> using frozen meat, thaw it, it's cooked. Otherwise, 
    bring to a boil enough water to cover and add a dash of vinegar. Stir 
    snails into boiling water. Bring it just up to a simmer, then simmer 
    very slowly for 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Snail Meat</b> very fine - its tough.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOT</b>, <b>GARLIC</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="4">
  <li>At this point you can put your pasta in boiling salted water and 
    start cooking it.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> in a pan and add <b>Shallot Mix</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>, fry gently stirring until shallots are translucent but 
    not at all browned. Stir 
    in chopped <b>Snails</b> for just a few seconds and turn off heat. 
    Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Pasta</b> and return to the pot. Stir in just enough 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> to coat (about 1/2 tablespoon), Season to taste with 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Place pasta out into shallow bowls 
    and spoon <b>Snail Sauce</b> over it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Apple Snails:</h3> &nbsp; You can buy these frozen in the shell 
  or as frozen meat in Asian markets. If you can't go out and catch your 
  own, frozen meat is much more convenient and economical than whole 
  snails. For 4 ounces of foot meat you'll need about 2-1/2 pounds of 
  whole snails (10% yield). For frozen meat, you need 6 ounces to yield 
  4 ounces thawed and drained (67% yield). Apple snails can be caught 
  wild in Florida and Hawaii (go for the big varieties). They must be 
  cooked thoroughly because they may harbor parasites that can infect 
  humans. For details see our
