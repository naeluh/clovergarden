Delicious! But why urgent? &nbsp; Urgent is when I have a whole lot of 
Tomatoes on the counter getting over-ripe, and no recipe scheduled to use 
them.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1.1 hrs if all hand chopped)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water. Slice in half lengthwise, core and peel skin. Set each half 
    down on its flat side and slice crosswise as thin as you can, then 
    lengthwise. Then chop them very small, half the batch at a time. 
    See also <a href="9jv_calurg1.html#04"><b>Seeds</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Do not use a processor - they will be 
    bitter.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut into very thin, narrow strings. Cut the 
    strings crosswise very fine. For <b>CELERY</b>, do the same as for 
    Carrots. Mix all with Onions.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, then into threads, and chop the 
    threads fine.
  <li>Blast <b>ANAHEIM CHILI</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off 
    skin under running water. Cut into thin strips, and cut the strips 
    very fine.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Aromatics</b> items together.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qts is good), heat 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> over moderately high flame, and fry 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b> stirring very often until they start to color.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and bring to a fast simmer uncovered. When 
    most of the liquid has evaporated, cover tightly and simmer slowly for 
    about an hour until Tomatoes are very soft, but make sure there is 
    adequate liquid  (see <a href="9jv_calurg1.html#05"><b>Cooking Tomatoes</b></a>).</li> 
  <li>Stir in Tomato Sauce and bring back to a simmer. If your tomatoes 
    are deficient, or you want a smoother sauce, use 2 cans.</li>
  <li>Pull out Herb Stems and Leaves. Stir in <b>Seasonings</b> to taste.
    </li>
  <li>In an air-tight container, this will keep about 5 days in the 
    fridge. If you need longer, just bring back to a simmer and 
    repackage.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These need to be good tasting Tomatoes, 
  and a bit too ripe for salads. Here in Southern California we can 
  get Fresno Tomatoes from some produce markets. These ar much better 
  than supermarket tomatoes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is to make up for the poor taste 
  quality of the tomatoes we can buy. In Italy they use Tomato Paste, 
  but this is better. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, in a 
  convenient 8 oz can, but other very simple sauces will also work. If 
  your tomatoes just don't make the grade, use 2 cans.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; How can it be California without at least 
  some chili heat? I suggest our <a href="9jv_cpcals1.html">
  <b>California Chili Sprinkle</b></a>, which is very tasty but not very 
  hot - otherwise, see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili 
  Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Just about every French and Italian recipe will 
  tell you to seed your tomatoes so they won't make your sauce bitter. 
  This is total bullpucky! The seeds do no such thing, even in Italy. 
  This must be an attitude left over from the Victorian era, when people 
  just <u>did not</u> eat seeds. Proof: the Italians are very proud of 
  their canned tomatoes - even though they have been badly beaten by 
  California Central Valley tomatoes in every properly conducted blind 
  tasting. These have the seeds in them, yet <u>they are not bitter</u>, 
  perhaps a touch blah, but not bitter. By seeding tomatoes, you will 
  lose a lot of the juice that surrounds the seeds, where much of the 
  tomato's flavor resides. Don't do it.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cooking Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; In India and West Africa they fry 
  tomatoes until almost dry, "until the oil starts to separate". This is 
  supposedly to to rid them of their "bitter flavor". I don't know what 
  they're using for tomatoes in those regions, but I've never detected 
  any "bitter flavor" in ours, and cooking them that dry totally destroys 
  their wonderful fresh tomato flavor. Don't do it.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Why don't I use a food processor for chopping 
  the Tomatoes?  By time a food processor has chopped stuff evenly, it's 
  chopped it too fine. A tomato sauce that's chopped too fine lacks 
  textural interest, and splatters without mercy when simmering. You can 
  use your Mini-Prep for the Carots, Celery, and Anaheim Pepper if you 
  want.</li>
