  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove thick stems from <b>Carrot Tops</b>, keeping side stems 
    and thinner stem at the top end. Chop very coarse.</li>
  <li>Remove Mint Leaves from stems. Measure is packed medium firm.</li>
  <li>Bring a pan of lightly salted <b>Water</b> to a boil and stir in 
    <b>Carrot Tops</b>. Par boil for 3 minutes. Toss in <b>Mint</b> for 
    the last minute. Drain and refresh under cold running water. Squeeze 
    out excess water and spread on a plate to dry a little.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium. Grate <b>LEMON ZEST</b> and 
    squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. Chop <b>SCALLION</b> medium. 
    Crush <b>WALNUTS</b> small. Mix all with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>In your Mixie, Food Processor, or Blender place <b>Carrot Top 
    mix</b> and <b>Garlic mix</b>. Run to a paste, scraping down the 
    sides as needed. Now, a little at a time, add <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    blending smoothly. Again, you'll have to scrape down the sides 
    a few times.</li>
  <li>For Pasta, see <a href="9jv_carpto1.html#03"><b>Serving</b></a>. Refrigerated 
    in a sealed container it'll keep for several days, though the 
    color won't be quite so bright.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Carrot Tops:</h3> &nbsp; If they are fresh and large, tops from 
  one bunch of 5 to 6 medium carrots will make 1/2 cup of this Pesto, 
  or two bunches for 1 cup. A half cup may not seem like a lot, but is 
  actually sufficient for 1 pound of dry pasta. That's 2 T Pesto and 1 
  T hot Pasta Water for every 4 ounces of dry Pasta. It will also 
  spread a goodly number of canap&eacute;s as it is quite strongly 
  flavored. If you're a little short on Carrot Tops, you can include 
  a bunch of Parsley Leaves. Pestos are often made with Parsley in 
  Italy.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Scallion:</h3> &nbsp; Use green only. Measure is for chopped 
  fairly small and moderately packed.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; Place a heatproof container in the sink 
  under whatever you will strain the Pasta through, or you will 
  forget to reserve some Pasta Water. Strain the Pasta and pour it 
  back into the pot. Spoon in the appropriate amount of Pesto and 
  half that amount of hot pasta water. Stir it up until evenly 
  coated and serve.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Italian Pestos usually include grated 
  Cheese, which would severely offend Vegans. This Pesto can easily 
  stand without it, and providing some grated Parmesan on the side 
  to be sprinkled as desired makes service much more flexible. Since 
  I have a bag sealer, I seal the Pesto in a narrow 2-mil plastic bag 
  with the air squeezed out. I can cut a corner off and use it as a 
  squeeze tube.</li>
