<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3> Chilis, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; What Chilis you use is completely up to you. 
  The photo example was made with 2/3 yellow Aji Limo and 1/3 red Aji Juanita, 
  both are <i>C. baccatum</i> from South America. That's what grows best on 
  my Southern California property. These made a sauce a little less hot than 
  the ubiquitous Tapat&iacute;o sauce, but the flavor was far different, 
  delicious, actually. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
  <b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; Most people use plain distilled 5% vinegar, but 
  I usually use a 5% wine vinegar. Use any 5% vinegar of your choice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Onion or Garlic:</h3> &nbsp; Garlic is most used (about 4 cloves per 
  pound of Chilis, but Red Onion also works quite well with a somewhat 
  different flavor, and what I used for the example. Either is optional and 
  can be omitted if desired.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Straining:</h3> &nbsp;  An option is to press the mash through a very 
    fine strainer (available in Asian markets) for a more liquid sauce, 
    You'll get about 1/3 the volume after straining. The solids can be 
    dried and ground to make a condiment or seasoning.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fermenting:</h3> &nbsp; Many sauces, like Tabasco, are fermented for 
  various lengths of time (up to 3 years for Tabasco). This process is not 
  difficult, but adds some complexity and a couple weeks or more fermenting 
  time. When I have more experience with fermenting Chilis, I'll write it 
  up and put a link here.</li>
