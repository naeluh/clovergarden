<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Carrot Tops:</h3> &nbsp; These should be nice and fresh. Two bunches 
  just yielded a cup. If you are a bit short on Carrot Tops you can fill it 
  out with Flat Leaf Parsley. Parsley is official in Argentina, but it 
  <u>must</u> be flat leaf, curly  parsley is natures imitation of a plastic 
  garnish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; Traditional Argentine Chimichurri does not use 
  Cilantro, but some more recent recipes do. Here in Southern California we 
  like Cilantro a lot, so I include plenty of it.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oregano:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is strongly preferred, but many recipes 
  do allow dried, about 3/4 teaspoon.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake</h3> &nbsp; Korean flake is good, for not very hot. In 
  Argentina they use Aji Molido / Aji Triturado. It is fairly mild, based on 
  Mirisol chilis (dried Aji Amarillo) but with other chilis often included. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html#east">
  <b>South American Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chopping:</h3> &nbsp; Modern recipes in English insist on using a Food 
  Processor (or, may the Gods forbid! a Blender). By time a food processor 
  gets stuff chopped evenly it's much too fine. Some recipes say just to 
  pulse the processor a few times. Their photos show a very unevenly chopped 
  Chimichurri. Do chop by hand. I use a <a href="../ke/kn_mezzaz.html">
  <b>Mezzaluna</b></a> on the herbs, which chops much more quickly than a 
  regular knife, and without bruising the herbs.</li>
