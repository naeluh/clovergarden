  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Break the <b>Japones</b> in half and dump out as many seeds as 
    will go. Remove the cores and seeds from all the rest of the 
    chilis and cut them into shreds with kitchen shears. They should 
    be fresh enough they are a bit leathery, not crumbly.</li>
  <li>Grind all the Chilis to fine flake in your spice grinder. A little 
    whirling blade coffee grinder is perfect for this.</li> 
  <li>Mix the <b>Chilis</b> together thoroughly. You can add some salt 
    to the mix if you think that would be appropriate for you expected 
    usage.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar. Stored in a cool place away from light 
    it should be good for at least 6 months.</li>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; For details, descriptions and photos of all 
  these Chilis, see our <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I was working on my Chinese Chilis page. As 
  part of this I ground and tasted each of the Chinese Chilis, and also 
  ground a bunch of common Mexican chilis to see if they were a good 
  substitute. I ended up with a lot of little bowls with ground chilis 
  in them. When I was through, I just poured them all into a bowl and 
  mixed them, then put them up in a spice jar. When I tried this mix as 
  a sprinkle, I found it amazingly good. I then set out to create a 
  similar sprinkling mix that included only easy to get Mexican chilis. 
  This recipe is the result. </li>
