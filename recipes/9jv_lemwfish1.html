This is my favorite sauce for fish, because it doesn't at all mask the 
taste of the fish. I paid for fish, so that's what I want to taste. Its 
actually more a dip than a sauce, but I spoon it over the fish.

This sauce is quite lemony as given, but you can balance to your taste 
by changing the ratio of wine to lemon juice. You could also use black 
pepper instead of the chili. The photo example is made with Scotch 
Bonnet chili. If your fish is an oily one, you can skip the butter, but 
if it is one with a dry mouth feel, you can increase the butter.

<p>Almost every fish on our <a href="../ingred/seafishv.html">Fish 
Page</a> (very large page) was tested with this sauce. I do not 
include salt, because there's usually enough mixed with the rice 
flour I dust the fish with for frying, or in the poaching water. 
Various finely chopped herbs also work very well with this sauce. </p>
<p>I always spoon this sauce over the fish on my plate. Then, when 
breaking up the fish, I tumble pieces in the sauce surrounding it. 
I always eat fish with chopsticks because they give me precise control 
over how I break it up.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seed <b>CHILI</b> and cut into fine threads and chop fine or as 
    desired.</li>
  <li>If using <b>HERBS</b> chop them fine. This can be a mix of any of 
    fresh Parley, Thyme, Oregano, Sage, Tarragon (not too much), Chives, 
    Scallions, Cilantro - or whatever you have.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b> and mix in a small sauce pan with 
    <b>White Wine</b>, <b>Butter</b> and <b>Chili</b>. Bring to a 
    simmer for a couple minutes to reduce the alcohol, then stir in 
    herbs (if used) and turn down below a simmer to keep hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot spooned over fish, or as a dip.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>White Wine:</h3> &nbsp; I usually use a lightly 
  sweet wine such as Riesling or Gew&uuml;rztraminer, but also may use 
  drier wines such as Sauvignon Blanc. Suit your own taste.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The object is flavor, not 
  hotness, so a flavorful chili should be used. I often use a whole red 
  Fresno, with the seeds removed. I also sometimes use 1/2 of a Manazana, 
  or 1/3 of a Scotch Bonnet, both with seeds and membranes removed. For 
  more information see our <a href="../ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.
