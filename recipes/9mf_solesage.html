<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was for Petrale Sole, 
  a small Flounder much sold here in Southern California. Other light 
  colored fillets that aren't too thick can be used. Tilapia, used in 
  the photo example, is a bit awkward due to the large thin area.
  <br><b>Do Not Use</b> Pacific "Dover Sole", more properly called 
  "Slime Fish" - it's unrelated to European "Dover Sole" / "Common Sole", 
  doesn't cook well and is mainly used is as scrap fish to feed minks 
  on fur farms - or sold to unsuspecting consumers.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sage Leaves</h3> &nbsp; This is for fresh Sage. Measure is firmly 
  packed after shredding. This measure is for weak supermarket Sage, if 
  your Sage is quite strong, use just 1 Tablespoon.</li>
