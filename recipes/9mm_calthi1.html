These delectable burgers are a Los Angeles creation in the Thai style 
(Thai is an almost native cuisine here). See <a href="9mm_calthi1.html#05">
<b>Background</b></a> for details. Make the patties far enough ahead 
to rest 2 to 3 hours in the fridge. For methods, see

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs &nbsp; + &nbsp; 2+ hrs in the fridge)
<ol>
<li>Give the <b>GROUND BEEF</b> a vigorous chopping to make it finer. 
  If you grind your own Beef be sure it is very cold going into the 
  grinder, and pass it through twice, then chop vigorously.</li>
<li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into thin slivers, and chop 
  those fine. Place in a big mortar and pound moderately.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Add to the mortar and pound 
  fairly well.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very small. Add to the mortar and pound well.</li>
<li>Run the <b>RED CHILIS</b> in your spice grinder or otherwise render 
  into fine flakes. Cut <b>GREEN CHILIS</b> into strips lengthwise and 
  chop fine (see <a href="9mm_calthi1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Mix.</li> 
<li>Roll up each lobe of the <b>LIME LEAVES</b> very tight in the stem 
  direction. Slice into threads on both sides of the stem, discarding 
  the stem. Chop the threads fine. Add to <b>Chilis</b></li>
<li>Crush or grate <b>PALM SUGAR</b> as needed.</li>
<li>Mix all <b>Patties items</b> until very well distributed and the 
  meat is paste-like. I give the whole mass a good chopping on the 
  cutting board, and then massage vigorously. Refrigerate for 2 hours 
  or more.</li>
<li>Prepare <b>Garnishes</b> as you desire.</li>
<li>Beat together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min per batch)
<ol start="11">
<li>Form <b>Patties</b> about 4-3/4 inch diameter and 1/2 inch thick, a 
little thinner in the center than at the edges. After cooking, these 
  will be about 3-3/4 inches diameter and 3/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>By your chosen method (see <a href="9mm_calthi1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>): Grill 
  or Fry the <b>Patties</b>, preferably medium rare, or however you like 
  them.</li>
<li>Arrange on individual plates, optionally over <b>Lettuce Leaves</b>. 
  Apply <b>Garnishes</b> as desired. Top with a drizzle of <b>Sauce</b>.
  Serve immediately</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef, ground:</h3> &nbsp; This should be 80% lean. Much leaner 
  and it will lose flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, Dry Red:</h3> &nbsp; The standard Japones will be fine for 
  most people. For hotter, use de Arbols, or Thai for even hotter, or 
  just add more chilis if you want, or reduce to 4 for folks from the 
  Frozen North (anywhere north of Sacramento).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis, Thai Green:</h3> &nbsp; These are variable, from very hot 
  to disappointing, but usually pretty hot. If you are afraid of them 
  you can scrape out the seed cores (this is called "wimping out").</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 lobes to a leaf, so 
  this recipe needs 4 lobes. These have become quite available in the 
  Asian markets in Southern California. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of a regular lime.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; This is easily found in Asian markets 
  (at least here in Southern California). If you don't have it, use a 
  partially refined sugar such as Turbinado.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil &amp; Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; These patties can be cooked a number 
  of ways. Grilled over charcoal or gas (oil the grill) is preferred by 
  the recipe originator. They can also be pan fried (in about 1/8 inch 
  oil), or fried on a hot griddle (oil the griddle). These methods 
  are listed as acceptable alternatives by the recipe originator.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Herbs, etc:</h3> &nbsp; Your choice of herbs appropriate to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines. Cilantro is pretty much required. Thai 
  Basil, Mint, of Parilla are good. Dill would be more Vietnamese than 
  Thai, but what the hell. Other options are slivers of Red Onion, 
  Scallions, Thai Green Chilis, etc.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Background:</h3> &nbsp; This burger is based on a recipe by Los 
  Angeles Times senior food writer Jenn Harris. It was her attempt to 
  duplicate the Jazz Burgers of Jazz Singsanong, served "off-menu" at 
  her Thai restaurant in Los Angeles. Jazz declared "It's not the Jazz 
  Burger, but I love it". Here I present it re-stepped and with minor 
  adjustments.</li>
