  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch dice, or a little smaller 
    if desired. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut into thin sticks. 
    Cut the sticks into bits less than 1/4 inch in size. Dice <b>CELERY</b> 
    to size similar to Carrots. Seed <b>CHILIS</b> and remove veins to the 
    extent you feel appropriate - the more veins, the hotter. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>MUSHROOMS</b> and cut into dice about the size of the Potatoes. 
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed saucepan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry  
    <b>Miripoix</b>, stirring over moderate heat until Onions are translucent, 
    but not browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b>, <b>Thyme Sprigs</b>, and <b>Oregano</b>. 
    Fry stirring another 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Barley</b>.
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth</b>,<b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Pepper</b>. 
    Bring to a boil and turn to a simmer until Barley is nearly tender 
    (about an hour).</li> 
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in. Bring back to a simmer and cook 
    until Potatoes are done (about 20 minutes). Stir and scrape the bottom 
    as needed to keep Barley from sticking to the pan.</li>
  <li>Check salt and serve hot. This soup reheats very well, but you'll have 
    to add more broth or water as the Barley keeps absorbing it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a lightly pearled barley. It has a very 
  light beige color, more flavor and does not stick to the pan as much as 
  the white fully pearled barley.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example used Crimini Mushrooms, as that 
  is what I had on hand. White Mushrooms or small King Trumpet mushrooms can 
  also be used. If you use fresh Shiitakes, soak them in warm water as if they 
  were dried, then wring them out, this transforms their texture.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example used one Fresno, seed core 
  removed and veins left in. Heat was noticeable but not at all obtrusive. 
  Serranos will also work, or your Chili of choice. Dried Chilis could also 
  be used.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oregano:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for dried leaf. If using fresh, use 
  about 3 times as much.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Vegetable, Pork, Chicken broth can be used.  Home 
  made is best, but you could use canned or Bouillon cubes or powder. If 
  using canned, you'll probably want to use 7 cups and no water. For details 
  on making broth, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / 
  Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07"> 
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; It is acceptable to add some meat to a Miripoix, 
  usually diced Ham or diced Pork Belly. In similar soups, some people 
  pur&eacute;e a small amount of the soup to thicken it.</li>
