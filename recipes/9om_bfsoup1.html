<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Any cut of Beef can be used, cooked by any means, 
  so long as it will be tender with very little additional cooking.
<li id="02"><h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; I use dried Thai Chilis or similar. 
  This gives the soup a noticeable bite. If you or your guests are a bit 
  chili adverse, use the common Japones - or adjust to your best judgement. 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Almost any kind can be used. The photo example 
  was made with dry Shiitakes soaked well before use (0.7 oz to make 2 
  ounces, about 4). Fresh Shiitakes should also be well soaked and wrung out, 
  it improves their texture. No soaking for White Mushrooms or King Trumpets. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a>
  page. </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mint Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; You could use Parsley or Cilantro Leaves 
  instead if you prefer, but I like the mint.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Beef Broth:</h3> &nbsp; I usually buy beef in large chunks, trim them 
  of fat and membranes, toss all offcuts into a pot and simmer for a few 
  hours. I freeze any meat I don't need now. Strained and defatted, brought 
  to a boil and poured into a jar with a tightly sealed lid, broth will last 
  weeks in the fridge and be ready for uses like this soup. You could, of 
  course use Bouillon cubes or powder. If you have to use canned broth, you'll 
  probably need all broth, no water. For details on making stock, see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Pasta</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a pasta larger than typical soup pasta so 
  the texture and bite are quite distinct - something like Ditali (very short 
  tubes about 1/3 inch diameter) works well.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; For a soup that holds longer hot and reheats better, 
  cubes of a waxy potato can be used instead of Pasta, about 5 ounces, but 
  reduce the water by 1/2 cup as potatoes won't be absorbing any water. Rice 
  can also be used. Use long grain rice as medium grain never stops absorbing 
  water.</li>
