  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b>. Pinch off stems. Run Leaves in a salad 
    spinner. If doing ahead, bag in plastic and refrigerate up to 
    overnight. Some of the Stems can also be used - see <a href="9ov_tomspn1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>. (20 min)</li>
  <li>Make <b>STOCK</b> if you don't have it on hand. See <a href="9ov_tomspn1.html#03">
    <b>Stock</b></a>. (45 min)
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 1/4 to 3/8 inch dice, keeping all seeds and 
    juice with them.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into about 1/4 inch dice. Cut <b>CELERY</b> into 
    about 1/4 inch dice. If using, cut <b>Spinach Stems</b> 1/4 inch. 
    Mix all.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Spinach</b> fairly coarse. Chop <b>Mint</b> small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Coriander Seeds</b> and <b>Cumin Seeds</b> in your 
    spice grinder. Mix all <b>Seasonings</b> items.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a sauce pan sized for the whole recipe, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Onion mix</b> until Onions are just getting translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasonings mix</b> for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, bring to a boil and simmer, stirring 
    occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. You should end up 
    with a fair amount of liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, bring to a boil and simmer for about 3 
   minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach mix</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer just 
   a couple of minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot (see <a href="9ov_tomspn1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Leaves only. <b>Not</b> "baby 
  spinach", which lacks flavor. Some or all of the stems can be used, 
  chopped and fried with the Onions.  Wash by floating in a tub of 
  clean cold water and sloshing around.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; I used Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, 
  which are fairly hot, and give this soup moderate spiciness by 
  Southern California standards. Use your own best judgement as to what 
  powder and amount, but don't leave it out, even if you're from the 
  Frozen North. For details see our <a href ="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Vegetable, Chicken or Pork stock can be used. 
  The photo example used Vegetable Stock made from trimmings from the 
  day's market trip - it only takes 45 minutes or so.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> If serving as a main dish soup, have a bowl of 
  steamed Jasmine rice on the table with a spoon, so folks can spoon 
  in however much they want.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe was suggested to me in a dream. 
  Dreams, are a bit unstable and don't provide weights and measures, so 
  some interpretation was needed for a real recipe. I did stay with 
  the given basics, Diced Tomatoes, Diced White Onion, and Spinach. 
  The French and Italians say to squeeze out the Tomato Seeds to 
  avoid their bitterness. Much of the flavor of a tomato is in the 
  seed mass, and I've <u>never</u> detected any bitterness caused by 
  tomato seeds. This may be a hang-over from the Victorian era, when 
  people just <u>didn't</u> eat seeds.</li>
