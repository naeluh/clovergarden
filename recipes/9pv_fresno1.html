This delightful quick pickle is made from Red Fresno Chilis. It's a fine 
condiment for many cuisines - and is only a little hot - depending on 
how diligent your are at removing the membranes (I'm not real diligent). 
This recipe will fill a 3 to 3-1/2 cup jar.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Fresno Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These chilis are 
  easily found in Southern California because they have been accepted 
  as a suitable medium hot red chili for practically every ethnic 
  cuisine cooked here, and that's just about all of them. Korean 
  markets are the most reliable source, but they cost less in other 
  Asian markets. The big supermarket chains call them "red jalapenos", 
  which they are not, and charge way too much. If you don't have Fresnos, 
  other chilis will work too. The best substitute would be Red Anaheims 
  (less heat), real Red Jalape&ntilde;os, or Red (or orange or yellow) 
  Bell Peppers (no heat unless you add chilis). For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Use a fully natural Sea Salt 
  such as that sold in Korean markets. Table salt may contain flow 
  agents that could make the pickle murky. Diamond Crystal Kosher salt 
  is an alternative (other brands have flow agents) - but use nearly 
  twice the measure as it's very fluffy.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes of this sort 
  include a lot more sugar, up to 3 times as much. I don't like things 
  too sweet, so keep sugar under control. It needs some, but I'm fine 
  with 1 T.</li>
