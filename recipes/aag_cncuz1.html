A very simple snack. The corn does not puff up like Popcorn, but it does 
become soft enough to eat as a salted snack. See also

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>Oil</b> in an coverable frying container and bring up to 
    frying temperature, about 350&deg;F/180&deg;C. Stir in <b>CORN</b> 
    until evenly coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Cover the pan and shake almost continuously. Some of the corn will 
    pop violently. When they have been popping for a few minutes, turn 
    off the heat. When they stop popping, take off the lid and sprinkle 
    with Salt.</li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; Most of the corn kernels will not have popped, 
    but if nearly 1/4 of them have, the unpopped ones will be just as 
    edible.</li>
  <li>Serve, warm or at room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Cuzco Yellow Corn:</h3> &nbsp; This is sold in 15 oz bags in markets 
  that have a good South &amp; Central American section. Here in Los Angeles, 
  Vallarta Markets, and now (12-2020) Super King Markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_corn.html#cuzco"><b>Corn</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; It is best to use an iron pan which is supposed 
  to have a varnish "seasoning", rather than your shiny tri-ply saut&eacute; 
  pan, as the varnish is hard to remove. It may take a squirt of oven cleaner 
  to do it. The pan must be covered, as otherwise the popped corn will fly 
  far and fast. An iron skillet with a stainless cover from a saut&eacute; 
  pan or pot is fine, the cover will be easy to clean.</li>
