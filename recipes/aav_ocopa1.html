In Peru, this famous dish from Arequipa is called an "appetizer", but I 
think of it more as a light lunch served with beer. Just the word "Ocopa" 
presumes Ocopa Sauce served over Potatoes with the three standard 
garnishes.

The three standard garnishes are so standard I've not seen a photo that 
didn't include them, so don't leave them out. This recipe makes 2-1/2 
cups of the sauce.  See also <a href="aav_ocopa1.html#09"><b>Serving</b></a>.</p>

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> 
  <ol>
  <li>Hard cook <b>EGGS</b> and peel them for garnish (see our recipe 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> for the best 
    method). &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 10 min work).</li>
  <li>Boil <b>POTATOES</b> in their skins until just done. Chill well 
    for slicing. &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min - 5 min work + chill time)</li>
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>PEANUTS</b> until lightly browned. For details 
    see our recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted 
    Peanuts</b></a>. &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 minutes)</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make Sauce</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>QUESO</b> small. 
  <li>Mix <b>Aji Amarillo Paste</b> and <b>Huacatay Paste</b>.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion</b> until Onions are 
    translucent. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring until it 
    threatens to color. Stir in <b>Aji Amarillo Paste mix</b>. 
    Take off heat.</li>
  <li>Load all <b>Sauce items</b> <u>except</u> only half the 
    <b>Condensed Milk</b> into a Food Processor or Blender. Process 
    until smooth adding just enough <b>Evaporated Milk</b> to make a 
    thick but quite pourable sauce (it has to both coat and run down 
    through the potatoes). If it gets too thin, add some more crackers.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Serving</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Peel <b>Potatoes</b>. Slice 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; In Peru, "Yellow Potatoes" are used, but 
  these are not the same as the "Yukon Gold" type so often called for 
  by recipes in English. On the other hand, Yukon Gold type do slice 
  very well if perfectly cooked, which is why fancy chefs love them. 
  Red Potatoes or White Rose would be no more "unauthentic" than 
  Yukon Gold - the most important consideration is that they slice 
  well. Choose potatoes of moderate size as large ones tend to split in 
  slicing. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peanuts:</h3> &nbsp; Dry Pan Roasting produces 
  peanuts that are different from commercially roasted in appearance, 
  texture and taste. Use commercially roasted peanuts only if you 
  have to.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Queso Fresco:</h3> &nbsp; This is a soft white cheese available 
  in disk shaped packages in any market serving a Mexican, Central or 
  South America community. Any plain soft white Queso Fresco can be used.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Aji Amarillo Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or frozen Aji Amarillos could 
  be used (fry with the onions). We call for the Paste because it's much 
  more available in North America, and is often used in Peru. It can be 
  found in markets serving a South American community or on-line. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_ajiyz.html">
  <b>Aji Amarillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Huacatay Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Huacatay leaves can be 
  used, but we call for the Paste because it's far more available in 
  North America, and is often used in Peru. It can be found in markets 
  serving a South American community or on-line.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/dy_huacaz.html"><b>Huacatay</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Crackers:</h3> &nbsp; Various recipes call for Soda Crackers, 
  Animal Crackers, Cream Crackers, Saltines, etc. I used Maria crackers 
  from Spain.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Evaporated Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This is an unsweetened product. Do 
  not mistake Condensed Milk for Evaporated Milk. That product is like 
  liquid candy. I use a brand without Oil.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Three or four per serving. These could be 
  large purple Alphonso olives which are grown in Peru, or large 
  Kalamatas. For details see our <a href="../ingred/olives.html">
  <b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe makes up plates
  for table service. For buffet service, see the way I have made up 
  <a href="aav_pothuan1.html"><b>Potatoes with Cheese Sauce</b></a>, 
  a very similar recipe from a different region of Peru. The sauce can 
  be made more than a day ahead - refrigerated in a sealed container it 
  will keep for several days.</li>
