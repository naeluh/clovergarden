  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Cut ends off <b>Plantains</b> and make shallow slits down the peel with 
    the point of you knife, being careful not to cut into the flesh.  Peel 
    them (the greener they are, the harder to peel). Cut into lengths of 
    1 to 1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Oil</b> in a kadhai, wok or other suitable deep fry container. 
    Bring up to about 300&deg;F/154&deg;C and fry <b>Plantain</b> in modest 
    size batches. Keep them moving in the oil, and keep the temperature 
    low so they have time to soften through before becoming light golden. 
    Drain them.</li>
  <li>Press each <b>Plantain Segment</b> lengthwise to less than 1/2 inch 
    thickness. In their region they have a special press, but I use a wide 
    flat bottomed glass jar, which allows me to see what's happening 
    underneath.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> you need to hold the Patacones at this point, see 
    <a href="aav_patac1.html#03"><b>Do-Ahead</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Oil</b> up to about 330&deg;F/165&deg;C. Fry the 
    <b>Patacones</b>, about 4 at a time, until light golden. Flip them over 
    once. They are done when they have a light golden color and are floating 
    at the top of the oil. Drain them on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with <b>Salt</b> while still hot, so the Salt sticks better.
    </li>
  <li>These are best served warm, and sprinkled with <b>Salt</b> (see 
    <a href="aav_patac1.html#02"><b>Salt</b></a>). A bowl of sauce is often provided - such 
    as <a href="ajv_hogao1.html"><b>Hogao</b></a> (Colombia) as a toping, 
    or <a href="ajv_mojver1.html"><b>Mojo Verdi</b></a> as a dip or spread.
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Plantains:</h3> &nbsp; These large bananas should be very green, but 
  sometimes all that can be had is green streaked with yellow. These will 
  work, but be a lot sweeter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bn_plantz.html"><b>Plantains</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Best is a good finishing salt for sprinkling, such as 
  Fleur de Sel or Maldon. The contrast between salty and sweet is desirable.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; The Patacones can be held for some hours at this 
  stage. Make a solution of 1 cup Water, 2 T Lime Juice. Dip them in for 10 
  seconds each, drain, pat dry with paper towels, bag and refrigerate. This 
  dip can be used even if the Patacones will be fried immediately, as it will 
  somewhat improve the results.</li>
<li id="04">
