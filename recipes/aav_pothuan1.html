In Peru, this famous dish is called an "appetizer", but I think of it 
more as a light lunch served with beer.  The three garnishes are 
standard, don't omit them. See also <a href="aav_pothuan1.html#07"><b>Service</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; In Peru, "Yellow Potatoes" are used, but 
  these are not the same as the "Yukon Gold" type so often called for 
  by recipes in English. On the other hand, Yukon Gold type do slice 
  very well if perfectly cooked, which is why fancy chefs love them. 
  Red Potatoes or White Rose would be no more "unauthentic" than 
  Yukon Gold - the most important consideration is that they slice 
  well. Choose potatoes of moderate size as large ones tend to split in 
  slicing. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Queso Fresco:</h3> &nbsp; This is a soft white cheese available 
  in disk shaped packages in any market serving a Mexican, Central or 
  South America community. Any plain soft white Queso Fresco can be used.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Aji Amarillo Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or frozen Aji Amarillos could 
  be used (fry with the onions). We call for the Paste because it's much 
  more available in North America, and is often used in Peru. It can be 
  found in markets serving a South American community or on-line. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_ajiyz.html">
  <b>Aji Amarillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Crackers:</h3> &nbsp; Various recipes call for Soda Crackers, 
  Animal Crackers, Cream Crackers, Saltines, etc. I used Maria crackers 
  from Spain.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Evaporated Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This is an unsweetened product. Do 
  not mistake Condensed Milk for Evaporated Milk. That product is like 
  liquid candy. I use a brand without Oil.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Three or four per serving. These could be 
  large purple Alphonso olives which are grown in Peru, or large 
  Kalamatas. For details see our <a href="../ingred/olives.html">
  <b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe makes up a single platter, 
  suitable for dishing out or for buffet service. This recipe is often 
  served on individual plates for table service. For table service, see 
  the way I have made up <a href="aav_ocopa1.html"><b>Okopa Sauce with 
  Potatoes</b></a>, a very similar recipe from a different region of 
  Peru. Of course the quantities for garnishes will need to be adjusted. 
  The sauce can be made more than a day ahead - refrigerated in a sealed 
  container it will keep for several days.</li>
