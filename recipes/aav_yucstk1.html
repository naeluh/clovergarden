  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>YUCA</b> fairly deep to remove wax coating, skin, and all 
    color from under the skin.</li>
  <li>Cut into the lengths you want your sticks to be, usually 2-1/2 to 3 
    inches.</li>
  <li>Place in a pot with water to cover well (they will expand). Bring to 
    a boil and set to a simmer until done, about 35 minutes. There should 
    be no hard opaque white areas in them. They will break up lengthwise by 
    time they're done.</li>
  <li>Drain and let cool. break in half lengthwise and pull the hard root 
    out of the center. Cut into sticks as close to 1/2 inch square as you 
    can get (mostly not real close).</li>
  <li>Spread out on a baking sheet or similar, and set in the freezer 
    for 6 hours, or as long as many days.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Do not thaw the sticks.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Oil</b> in a kadhai, wok or other suitable deep fry container. 
    Bring up to about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C and fry <b>Sticks</b> in modest 
    size batches - not too dark, they will look a bit darker as they cool.
    </li>
  <li>Scoop out with you spider and drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>While still warm, tumble with very fine <b>Salt</b> (see 
    <a href="aav_yucstk1.html#02"><b>Salt</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Serve, warm or at room temperature, with dip of your choice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Yuca:</h3> &nbsp; [Cassava, Manioc, Tapioca root] &nbsp; This root is 
  sold in any market serving a Tropical or Subtropical community. It is 
  heavily waxed to prevent drying out, but is still highly perishable. Buy 
  from a market with heavy turnover and check there are <u>no</u> soft spots. 
  As it ages, Yuca gets purple streaks in the flesh. I always buy an extra, 
  in case one is disappointing. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; I run regular sea salt crystals in my spice grinder 
  so the powder adheres to the Yuca sticks better.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dips:</h3> &nbsp; There are many South American dips, and they may 
  cross borders freely. Here are two examples (Peru) 
  <a href="ajd_roco1.html"><b>Rocoto Sauce / Dip</b></a> / 
  (Brazil) <a href="ajd_yogmnt1.html"><b>Yogurt Mint Sauce / Dip</b></a>.  
  You can use just a Salt-Vinegar dip, or most Southeast Asian dips.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; These are best served immediately, but are 
  pretty durable. The outside is still crisp after several hours at room 
  temperature, but eventually become just stiff.</li>
