  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Grate <b>VEGIE</b> fairly fine, but not to mush. Best to do this in a 
    Food Processor. I didn't want to wrestle my weighty processor out from 
    the low cupboard, so I did it in 3 batches in my 3 cup Mini-Prep&reg;</li>
  <li>Grate <b>MOZZARELLA</b> fairly fine. I just cubed it and tossed it into  
    the Mini-Prep after doing the Broccoli. Who cares if it gets Broccoli on 
    it, it's going to all be mixed together.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> moderately.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Fritters items</b> together until very even.</li>    
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min approx)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Set out wax paper and mold <b>Batter</b> into balls a little larger 
    than golf balls. Use your hands. Line the balls up on the wax paper.</li>
  <li>Place 3 T <b>Oil</b> in a large skillet (see <a href="abv_vegfrt1.html#02"><b>
    Comments</b></a>). Bring up to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Place in the pan as many <b>Batter Balls</b> as you can make fritters 
    without crowding. Flatten each one to no more than 1/2 inch thick. A 
    silicone spatula works well for this. When they are stiff enough, move 
    them around fairly often to fry evenly. When one side is lightly browned, 
    flip over using a thin turner, and steadied by the silicone spatula. Fry 
    on both sides until lightly browned and well set. Scoop out with the 
    turner and set on Paper Towels to drain excess oil. Add a little oil 
    between batches as needed - with too little oil they won't fry well - 
    and keep the pan temperature as close to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C as 
    you can.</li>
  <li>Serve, warm or at room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vegies:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is the part that you grate, exclusive of 
  offcuts discarded. This should be about 4 cups grated. The photo example 
  is made with Broccoli, and worked well. Other options are Cauliflower, 
  Green Beans, Carrots, Zucchini, Swiss Chard, Spinach. All the smaller 
  stems can be used for Broccoli, Cauliflower, and Chard, and all the stems 
  for Spinach. Use only one Vegie at a time to avoid muddy flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I strongly recommend doing this recipe in a 
  good quality electric skillet, which will regulate the temperature for 
  you. On the stovetop it takes an infrared thermometer and way too much 
  attention to do that.</li>
