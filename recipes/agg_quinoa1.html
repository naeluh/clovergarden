  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min + cool and chill)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Place <b>QUINOA</b> in a sauce pan with 2 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes. The grains should be softened and 
    burst. If needed, add a little boiling water. Take off the heat and let 
    cool. If any residual water remains, strain it out.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Cut <b>TOMATOES</b> into dice up to 1/2 inch 
    in size. Place in a bowl to drain. Plum Tomatoes won't drain much but 
    others will.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b> into pieces up to 1/2 inch in size. For 
    Persians, I cut lengthwise into 3 slices, then cut each slice in half 
    lengthwise and slice them into pieces crosswise. Tumble <b>Cucumber</b> 
    pieces with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and let sit for 20 minutes or more. </li> 
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> crosswise about 1/8 inch at the white end, 
    increasing to 1/4 inch at the green end. Place in a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>MINT</b> leaves from stems. Chop fairly small 
    - measure is after chopping. Add both to the Scallions.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Tomatoes</b>. Drain and rinse the <b>Cucumbers</b> and drain 
    well. Add both to the Scallions.</li>
  <li> Add <b>Quinoa</b> to the <b>Scallions</b> and tumble to mix evenly.
  </li>
  <li>In a jar, mix all <b>Dressing</b> items. Shake well and pour over 
    <b>Salad</b>. Toss it all gently to coat.</li>
  <li>Chill the Salad and serve garnished as you prefer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Quinoa:</h3> &nbsp; This "pseudo grain" has made a strong comeback 
  after being banned by the Spanish for religious reasons. It is now 
  easily available in North America in white and tricolor versions. 
  Commercially packed Quinoa in North America has had the bitter saponins 
  cleaned off. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ch_quinoz.html">
  <b>Quinoa Seeds</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If possible, use small cucumbers that don't 
  need to be skinned or seeded, such as Persian, Japanese or European. If 
  you have only the standard waxed green blimps, peel them and seed them, 
  then measure out the given weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a modern dish from Peru, clearly related 
  to the Levantine Tabouleh. The ingredients are all the same, except Bulgur 
  Wheat is replaced by Quinoa. The recipe is from real Peruvians, so 
  "authentic".  Yes, that's a big pile of Parsley and Mint, but that's the 
  way a real Tabouleh is made. It's not a Bulgur Salad with Herbs, it's an 
  Herb Salad with Bulgur.</li>
