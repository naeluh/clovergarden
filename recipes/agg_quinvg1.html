  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr + 45 min more to cool)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut off less than 1/4 inch of the stem end of you <b>AVOCADO</b> to 
    make sure it is good. It should be green with no discoloration.</li>
  <li>Place <b>QUINOA</b> in a sauce pan with 3-1/2 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes. The grains should be softened 
    and burst. If needed, add a little boiling water. Take off the heat. If 
    any residual water remains, strain it out. Place in a wide bowl, fluff 
    with a fork and set aside to cool.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; cut <b>TOMATOES</b> into very small dice. Place in 
    a strainer over a bowl to drain. Plum Tomatoes won't drain much but others 
    will.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut into very small dice. Slice white ends from 
    <b>CELERY</b> and cut into similar dice. Cap and core <b>BELL PEPPER</b> 
    and cut into similar dice. Cut <b>GREEN BEANS</b> crosswise about 1/4 
    inch. Mix all.</li>
  <li>In a 2 qt saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Carrot mix</b> for a couple minutes, then turn heat down, cover and 
    let Vegies steam in their own juices, until Carrots are crisp tender. 
    Remove from the pan and set aside to cool.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse for Garnish.</li>      
  <li>When all else is cooled and ready to mix, peel <b>AVOCADO</b> and cut 
    into small dice.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Tomatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>In a small jar, mix all <b>Dressing items</b>.</li>
  <li>in a large mixing bowl, add <b>Quinoa</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>,  
    <b>Carrot mix</b>, and 1/2 T <b>Salt</b>. Tumble until evenly mixed. 
    At this point it can be refrigerated even overnight.</li>
  <li>Spread <b>Avocado dice</b> over the top of the Salad.</li>
  <li>Shake up <b>Dressing</b> well and pour over the Avocado. Toss it 
    all gently until Avocado is well distributed and dressing coats all.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate as needed and serve cool, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Quinoa:</h3> &nbsp; This "pseudo grain" has made a strong comeback 
  after being banned by the Spanish for religious reasons. It is now 
  easily available in North America in white and tricolor versions. in Chile 
  it is the white which is grown. Commercially packed Quinoa in North America 
  has had the bitter saponins cleaned off. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ch_quinoz.html"><b>Quinoa Seeds</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Plum Tomatoes are best for this as they have less 
  water than other Tomatoes. In Chile, tomatoes are almost always peeled, but 
  I consider this optional due to the fine cut.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for Balsamic Vinegar, 
  but this is not made in Chile. Chile is a major wine producing region, so 
  a good Wine Vinegar is fine. I prefer red, but white will work too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a good buffet salad, as it will not 
  wilt. It can be made hours ahead, but do dress the Salad as soon as the 
  the Avocado is added to keep it from discoloring. For buffet service I 
  just stir in the Cilantro with the Carrots.</li>
