<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Grapefruit:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is as purchased. 
  I use Pink Grapefruit which are fairly sweet, so I add rather little 
  sugar, but at least some is needed to counter the bitterness of the 
  Grapefruit. If you use yellow grapefruits you will probably wish to 
  add quite a bit more. The pattern recipe called for 2 T.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; I use Persian cucumbers 
  which don't need to be peeled or seeded. You could also use the 
  standard green blimps for a different effect, both in taste and in 
  appearance. Of course you'll have to peel and seed those, so start 
  with a bit more weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Here you can regulate the heat to the 
  degree you desire - anything from a Sweet Paprika to something like 
  Kashmir (used in the photo example) or even hotter. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
