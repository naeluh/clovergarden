  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (11 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak 1/2 cup dried <b>GIANT CORN</b> overnight with plenty of water. 
    Drain.</li>
  <li>Pinch off the little dark point. This is done so the corn opens 
    "like a flower", but is not necessary for edibility.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>Giant Corn</b> with plenty of water to cover and bring to a 
    fast simmer. It is done when about half the kernels have opened (if you 
    pinched in step 2). This may take as much as 2-1/2 hours depending on 
    age of your corn.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min + chill)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut <b>TOMATOES</b> into dice about 1/2 inch on a side. Place in a 
    bowl to drain. Plum Tomatoes won't drain much but others will.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise. Trim the stem end, then 
    with cut side down, make 3 to 4 cuts (depending on size) lengthwise, but 
    not through the root end. Slice crosswise about 3/16 inch wide. Break 
    layers apart. Place in a mixing bowl along with <b>Giant Corn</b>.</li> 
  <li>Cut <b>Queso Fresco</b> into about 1/2 inch cubes. Add to the 
    Giant Corn.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> very fine and add to the Giant Corn.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Tomatoes</b> and add to the Giant Corn. Give the whole 
    salad a gentle tossing to mix.</li>
  <li>In a jar, mix all <b>Dressing</b> items. Pour over <b>Salad</b> and 
    toss it all gently to coat.</li>
  <li>Chill the Salad.</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> if needed. Slice crosswise.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>PARSLEY</b> leaves from stems and chop small.</li>
  <li>Serve chilled. garnished with Olives and Parsley. If serving as a 
    buffet dish, just stir those into the salad.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fava Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for "double peeled" frozen fava beans, 
  as preparing from fresh is expensive and time consuming.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Giant Corn:</h3> &nbsp;Weight is for fully cooked. 1/2 cup dried makes 
  1 cup cooked. This corn is popular in the Andes Mountain region, and is 
  available here in Los Angeles. If you don't have it, use Mexican Style 
  white Hominy from a can, already cooked. It's smaller, but otherwise, the 
  same thing.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Queso Fresco:</h3> &nbsp; This soft white unaged cheese can be found 
  in refrigerator cases in any market that serves a Latin American community. 
  It is invariably made in USA, because cheese is not imported from Mexico. 
  Queso Blanco would also work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html#mex"><b>Mexican Cheese</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The correct Chili for this salad is 1/4 to 1/2 of 
  an Aji Rocoto, but these are imperfectly available even here in Los Angeles. 
  I use 1/2 to 1 Serrano, seeds and all, but some recipes call for 1 to 2 
  teaspoons of Rocoto paste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html"><b>South American Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Olives, Black:</h3> &nbsp; The correct Olive is the Alfonso, which is 
  actually purple, not black. My usual store was out of them so I had to use 
  Colossal Greek Black Olives (not quite as colossal as Alfonsos).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; Most authentic recipes call for Parsley, but some 
  call for Cilantro.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The referenced cookbook says this salad is made 
  in many variations, but all three of my Peruvian cookbooks, and at least 
  a half dozen Web sites, give <u>exactly</u> the same recipe, which I repeat 
  here. We do, however, also have a rather different version, our recipe 
  <a href="agp_favcz1.html"><b>Fava Bean &amp; Cheese Salad</b></a>.</li>
