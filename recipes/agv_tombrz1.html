Satisfying, and not chili hot. Always present for BBQ (Churrasco) and also 
to accompany beans. For Salsa, you could cut a little smaller. See also

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 1/2 inch and let drain (drink the juice with 
    a touch of salt).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b>. For Persians, slice into quarters lengthwise and 
    then crosswise into slices a little less than 1/4 inch thick. These wedges 
    will be a little over 3/4 inch wide on the skin side, so cut any other 
    Cucumber similarly. Mix them well with 1 teaspoon of salt and let sit for 
    at least 20 minutes. Rinse and drain well.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> about 1/4 inch. </li>
  <li>Cut <b>Bell Pepper</b> into strips about 1/4 inch wide, then cut strips 
    crosswise about 3/4 inch long.</li>
  <li>Remove stems from <b>PARSLEY</b> and thick stems from <b>CILANTRO</b>. 
    Chop both fine and mix. Measure is after chopping and lightly packed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> crosswise, 1/8 inch at the white end increasing 
    to 1/4 inch or so at the green end. Mix with Parsley.</li>
  <li>In a small jar, mix all <b>Dressing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Toss together <b>All Items</b> except <b>Dressing</b>.</li>
  <li>When serving time nears, shake up <b>Dressing</b> and pour over 
    <b>Salad</b>. Toss to coat well. For Salsa, let stand at room temperature 
    for at least an hour to blend flavors. For Salad, rest it in fridge. 
  <li>Place in serving bowl(s) and serve cool or at a cool room temperature.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be ripe, but not over-ripe. 
  Plum Tomatoes can be used and will be less in need of draining.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use small cucumbers that 
  don't need to be skinned or seeded, such as Persian, Japanese or 
  European. If you have only the standard waxed green blimps, peel them 
  and seed them, then measure out the given weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Onion:</h3> &nbsp; Brazilians tend to use Yellow Onions, but White 
  or Red will work fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was made with green Bell 
  Peppers, but Red, Orange, or Yellow could be used. Green has a somewhat 
  sharper flavor than the other colors.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; White Vinegar seems to be preferred, but White Wine 
  Vinegar can be used and will be a little less sharp. Brazilians 
  <u>Do Not</u> use Lime Juice in this recipe - that's Mexican.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is best served the day it is made. 
  You can double the quantities for a large buffet salad. Brazilians say this 
  Salsa is essential to accompany grilled meats and BBQ (churrasco) of all 
  sorts. It's also used to accompany beans, or just with bread.</li>
