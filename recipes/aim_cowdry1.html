Salted and dried meats are important in the cuisines of several 
regions in South America. This method of preservation was essential 
in times past, but is still carried on because of the unique flavors 
and textures it provides.
<p>Thousands of years ago, drying llama meat was very important in the 
high Andes mountains. In that high, very cold and very dry environment, 
meat was simply hung out to dry, but in our lower altitudes, with 
warmer, moister weather, salt must be used in the process.</p>

<li>Here's the Beef.  I used a thin cut called "Shered", popular with 
  Hispanics. Cut from the Round, it is 1 inch at the thickest point. 
  One inch should be about your maximum thickness. Tough lean cuts 
  like Round work fine, and are tenderized by the process.</li>
<li>First sprinkle salt on the dish. I used some coarse sea salt I had 
  on hand, coarse kosher salt would probably be even better, as it's 
  designed to adhere to meat and draw out liquids.</li>
<li>Set the Beef over the salt, then sprinkle plenty of salt on top. 
  </li>
<li>Place the platter in a cool place.</li>
<li>Drain and repeat this procedure every morning and every evening 
  until no more liquid is drawn out. this should happen by the 
  fourth day.</li>

<li>Here's the Beef at the end of the 4th day. No more liquid was drawn 
  out after the last drain and resalt.</li>
<li>The Beef is now ready to dry. The traditional method is to hang it 
  up in a warm place, usually not in the sun, despite the name "Carne 
  de Sol". Preferably tent it with mosquito netting or the like to 
  keep the flies off. It should be taken inside at night.</li>
<li>Continue to dry until the beef is hard as a board, this should take 
  about 3 days. I have a convenient electric forced air dryer, so I used 
  that, turned to lowest heat. It took about 1-1/2 days.</li>

<li>Here's the finished product - hard as a board.</li>
<li>It should keep for some time at room temperature, but I seal it in a 
  plastic bag and refrigerate until needed.</li>
<li>For use, cut off what you need (I use a razor sharp Chinese cleaver 
  knife driven through with a soft faced mallet). Soak for 6 to 8 hours, 
  changing the water a couple times.</li>
