Cheiro Verde, literally "Green Smell", is practically universal to 
Brazillian &amp; Portuguese cuisines. See <a href="aiv_cheiv1.html#02"><b>Simplicity</b></a> 
and <a href="aiv_cheiv1.html#03"><b>Complexity</b></a> for details.

  <li>The "bunches" should yield about an equal weight of Parsley Leaves 
  and Scallion Greens. Just chop them both small or fine, depending on 
  your use, and mix. Wrapped in a paper towel, the mix will keep a few 
  days in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cebolinha</h3> &nbsp; This apparently can mean either Chives or 
  Scallions. Chives are perhaps more official, but Scallions are more 
  common due to availability, price and keeping properties - in Brazil 
  and in North America.  If using chives, they need to be the expensive 
  thin, round, tubular kind, not the flat or V shaped Asian or Garlic 
  chives so common here in Southern California.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Simplicity</h3> &nbsp; So important is the Parslery / Scallions 
  combination in Brazil, it can be difficult to buy just a bunch of 
  Parsley there - bunches of Parsley being so often paired with bunches 
  of Scallions in the markets. Chives are often used instead of Scallions.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Complexities</h3> &nbsp; Alas, it's just can't really be that 
  simple. In northern and northeastern Brazil, Cilantro is used instead 
  of Parsley, and in parts of Par&aacute; state in northern Brazil, 
  Culantro may be used (confusingly called Amazonian Chicory), and in 
  Bahia green chili may be added. In Portugal, it can contain both Parsley 
  and Cilantro along with Scallions. If in doubt, use the Parsley / Scallion 
  Greens or Parsley / Chives formulas.</li>
