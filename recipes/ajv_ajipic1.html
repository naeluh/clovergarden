A superb salsa. Colombian recipes feature little chili heat, but this salsa 
is a "must have" at the table. It is unthinkable to serve empanadas without it.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Scotch Bonnets are also fine. Any market 
  serving a Caribbean or Central American community should have one or the 
  other. One makes this sauce moderately hot, and two makes it distinctly 
  hot (by Southern California Standards) - use your own best judgement as 
  to how much. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html">
  <b>South American Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; What most Colombians think of as "hot" is 
  probably near what most Americans think of as "hot", but here in Southern 
  California, that would count as "mild". Aji ingredients are pretty standard, 
  but what chilis are used and how hot to make it varies widely. Exact 
  proportions of the ingredients and how they are chopped can also vary 
  considerably, affecting color and texture. The photo example was finished 
  in a mini-prep food processor. For a different version, see our 
  <a href="ajv_ajipic2.html"><b>Aji Picante #2</b></a>. Colombia is a major 
  grower of hot chilis, but they are nearly all shipped to the U.S. for 
  making Louisiana Hot Sauce.</li>
