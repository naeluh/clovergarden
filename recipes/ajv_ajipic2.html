A superb salsa. Colombian recipes feature little chili heat, but this salsa 
is a "must have" at the table. It is unthinkable to serve empanadas without it.

  <li>Remove seeds from whatever <b>CHILIS</b> you are using, and remove 
    veins to the extent you feel needed to reduce heat. I left about half 
    the veins in the Jalape&ntilde;os and it was fine for me, but some may 
    wish to remove them more completely. Chop fine. </li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fairly fine, white and green parts. Mix with

  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> fairly fine. Measure is after chopping and lightly 
    packed. Including thin stems is fine. Mix with Chilis.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b> and mix all <b>Dressing items</b> 
    with the <b>Chili mix</b>. Let stand at least 15 minutes for flavors 
    to blend.</li>
  <li>Serve in a deep bowl as a table condiment, especially if serving 
    Empanadas, but also for soups, stews and whatever. In a sealed jar 
    this sauce will keep about 10 days in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili Jalape&ntilde;o:</h3> &nbsp; This chili is easily available in 
  North America, but others are also used, medium or hot as desired. What 
  you want is 7 ounces of green or yellow-green chilis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a> page (You 
  aren't likely to find green South American chilis much of anywhere).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Aji Dulce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "no-heat" Habanero chili, popular in 
  Colombia and Venezuela but unavailable in most of North America. I used two 
  largish Red Fresno Chilis seeded and veins removed for no heat, but the 
  flavor is different.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Optional - add only if it didn't come out hot 
  enough for you. Use any Chili Flake that suits you in the quantity that 
  suits you. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; What most Colombians think of as "hot" is 
  probably near what most Americans think of as "hot", but here in Southern 
  California, that would count as "mild". Aji ingredients are pretty standard, 
  but what chilis are used and how hot to make it varies widely. Exact 
  proportions of the ingredients and how they are chopped can also vary 
  considerably, affecting color and texture. The photo example is cut fairly 
  fine by hand. For another version see our 
  <a href="ajv_ajipic1.html"><b>Aji Picante #1</b></a>. Colombia is a major 
  grower of hot chilis, but they are nearly all shipped to the U.S. for 
  making Louisiana Hot Sauce.</li>
