This is the essential condiment for serving with grilled meats in Argentina, 
and without grilled meats, can there even be an Argentina? It's also used with 
poultry and fish.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; This <u>must</u> be flat leaf parsley, curly 
  parsley is natures imitation of a plastic garnish. Some recent recipes 
  also include some Cilantro, but most traditional recipes do not.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oregano:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is strongly preferred, but many recipes 
  do allow dried, about 3/4 teaspoon.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; They don't have Red Chilis in Argentina, but 
  I have a very authentic traditional recipe from neighboring Uruguay, where 
  Chimichurri is just as popular. That one gets its hotness from fresh Red 
  Chilis. I like the idea of Red Chilis in the mix, but my hotness comes 
  from Argentine Aji Molido, so I remove seeds and membranes from Red Fresno 
  chilis to remove all the heat. If you don't have Fresnos, you can use 
  1/2 of a Red Anaheim.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Aji Molido: / Aji Triturado</h3> &nbsp; This is the chili flake of 
  Argentina. It is fairly mild, based on Mirisol chilis (dried Aji Amarillo) 
  but with other chilis usually included. Some Chimichurri recipes call for 
  Spanish Smoked Paprika as a substitute, but they'd need a little hot chili 
  powder too. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html#east">
  <b>South American Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chopping:</h3> &nbsp; Modern recipes in English insist on using a Food 
  Processor (or, may the Gods forbid! a Blender). By time a food processor 
  gets stuff chopped evenly it's much too fine. Some recipes say just to 
  pulse the processor a few times. Their photos show a very unevenly chopped 
  Chimichurri. Do chop by hand. I use a <a href="../ke/kn_mezzaz.html">
  <b>Mezzaluna</b></a> on the herbs, which chops much more quickly and 
  without bruising the herbs.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Chimichurri recipes <u>vary a lot</u> - not so 
  much in ingredients where they mostly agree, but in the <u>proportions</u>
  The most extreme recipe I have is from a Spanish language Argentine 
  cookbook written in Argentina. That one wants 1/4 cup Oil, 1 whole cup 
  Red Wine Vinegar, and 1 Tablespoon of Parsley. Others want a lot more 
  Oil and half the Vinegar I call for here. Amount of Parsley varies widely.
