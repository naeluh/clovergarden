<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes use Scallions (green part and all) 
  rather than regular Onions.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; As mentioned above, if tomatoes are 
  included it is properly called <i>Chancho en Piedra</i>. Tomatoes are 
  <u>always</u> peeled in Chile, even for salads.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is after chopping fine, lightly packed. 
  Recipes commonly call for "1 bunch flat leaf parsley and 1 bunch 
  Cilantro", but their photos all look like they have almost no herbs 
  in them. Either they cheated for the photos or they have awfully 
  small bunches where they live. From Southern California produce stores, 
  a "bunch" yields at least 1/3 cup and up to 1/2 cup of chopped leaves. 
  Note that some recipes call for just 1 bunch of one or the other.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Aji:</h3> &nbsp; The proper chili in Chile 
  is the yellow Aji Amarillo. Those are still nearly impossible to get 
  fresh in North America, even here in Los Angeles. Aji Amarillo paste is 
  quite easy to find in Latino markets, whole Aji Amarillo in cans and 
  jars can also be found, and a few markets have bags of them frozen. 
  Any of these products will work in this recipe. If you don't have 
  any of these, Some suggest an orange Habanero - similar flavor but 
  waaaay hotter. Use your own best judgement as to how much. for details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Aji Amarillo</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Properly, Pebra has no tomatoes, but this 
  has been widely corrupted. Many writers now call their condiment 
  "Pebra" even though it has tomatoes in it. There are, of course, 
  endless other variations on the basic recipe - the one given here 
  is just plain delicious.</li>
