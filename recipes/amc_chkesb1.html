Formerly made with Quail, this dish has been adapted to Chicken and Rabbit due 
to scarcity of Quail in Chile, and in North America too.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. Thigh Meat is 
  highly preferred for flavor and texture. The pattern recipe called for 8 
  Thighs, bone-in skin-on. This would weigh 4 pounds here in California. I 
  have modified this to just the meat for two reasons: the skin on the thighs 
  we get here has no adhesion to the meat, and bone in, while fine for table 
  service, is not so good for buffet service. Those 4 pounds yielded a little 
  over 2-1/2 pounds of meat. There is some loss of flavor from this, but I use 
  the bones, skins and fat to make a strong broth, used in place of Water 
  called for in the pattern recipe. This restores those flavors.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Wine, White:</h3> &nbsp; Sauvignon Blanc is recommended, or some other 
  non-sweet white wine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bay Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 2 Bay Leaves and 
  an unspecified number of leaves of Bitter Orange (Seville Orange). Good 
  luck finding those in North America. I used 3 Bay Leaves, fresh ones because 
  I have those.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika</h3> &nbsp; If you can, use real Hungarian Sweet Paprika, not 
  the sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets. Hungarian has much 
  better flavor and a more intense red color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; This is up to your best judgement. The 
  pattern recipe called for no Chili, but some recipes in Spanish call for 
  1 teaspoon Merk&eacute;n, a smoked chili flake unique to Chile. I have it 
  but you probably don't. The standard would be 1/2 to 1 Serrano. For details 
  see <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html"><b>Chilis of South America</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1-1/2 T Oil, and frying 
  in a saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt)in 3 batches. I <u>Strongly Recommend</u> 
  deep frying in an iron Khadi or Wok in 1-1/2 cups of a high temperature Oil 
  (Olive Pomace, Avocado, Peanut). It will take much less effort, the browning 
  will be far more even, there will be far less splattering onto the stove and 
  floor (especially with a Khadi), there isn't so much worrying about 
  burning the fond addhereing to the pan, and it can be done even a few days 
  ahead and refrigerated. Caution: do not over-brown.</li>
<li id="07"> 
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes allow just water, but Broth will 
  provide a better result. I make a strong broth from the skins, bones, and 
  fat I remove from the thighs. I strain the Broth, then defat it with my 
  gravy separator. If you don't have Chicken or Vegetable broth on hand, 
  fake it up with some <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken 
  Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Potatoes can be served as a side dish, or mixed 
  into the stew, which works well (you'll need a little more liquid). 
  <u>They must be cooked separtely</u>, not in the stew. The acid in the 
  Escabech will harden their surfaces. White Rose or similar work well in 
  recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum - especially if the stew is 
  re-heated. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Marinate:</h3> &nbsp; If you need it <u>Today</u>, just marinate at 
  room temperature for 3 hours or more, tumbling now and then. The acid and 
  alcohol will suppress bacteria growth, and even if some did grow, they'd 
  be destroyed by the cooking.</li>
