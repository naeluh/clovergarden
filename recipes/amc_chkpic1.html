<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Thigh:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless chicken meat. 
  The pattern recipe called for breast, but I use thigh meat for better 
  flavor and texture than the cardboard breasts we get around here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for Aji Panco, a rather 
  low heat chili that's imperfectly available in North America. Some 
  Bolivians use Aji Amarillo, which is yellow or orange. I used Chili Negro, 
  which is a bit hotter, but still made a mild dish. It is a very dark chili, 
  so my sauce is quite dark. For details see our pages 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html"><b>Chilis of South America</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes allow just water, but Broth will 
  provide a better result. I make broth from the skins and bones I remove 
  from the thighs. If you don't have Chicken or Vegetable broth 
  on hand, fake it up with some <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html">
  <b>Chicken Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Bolivia this dish is usually served with 
  Steamed Rice, Potatoes, and "Chu&ntilde;o Phuti" at the side, and a 
  topping of <a href="ajv_salcru1.html"><b>Salsa Cruda</b></a>. 
  Chu&ntilde;o Phuti is made from freeze dried potatoes (Chu&ntilde;o), 
  eggs and cheese. Chu&ntilde;o is not a pantry staple here in North 
  America, it adds a lot of complexity to making this dish, and it's an 
  "acquired taste", so I omited it. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_potchunz.html"><b>Chu&ntilde;o</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Buffet:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be made as a buffet dish. Cut the 
  Chicken into large bite sized chunks. Cook Potatoes separately and stir 
  in near the end of cooking. Stir in the Peas just before serving, as 
  they lose their bright color quickly. Serve from a slow cooker set to 
  "keep warm", with the Salsa Cruda in a bowl nearby. This recipe produces 
  2 pounds, not including potatoes or salsa.</li>
