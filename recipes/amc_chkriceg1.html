This dish, sold at stands in the marketplaces of Peru, can also be used 
as a side dish (cut the chicken a little smaller). See 
<a href="amc_chkriceg1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> on method.  This recipe can easily be 
doubled, making a very fine party buffet dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>RICE</b> and set soaking in water to cover for about 
    1/2 hour. Drain thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into pieces of the desired size, 1-1/2 inch on 
    a side is usually good - smaller if using as a side dish.</li>
  <li>Grind together all <b>Rub items</b>. Massage into <b>Chicken</b> 
    and set aside for 20 minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine if not using 
    paste. Mix all along with <b>Turmeric</b>.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>CARROT</b> small, about 1/4 inch. Thaw <b>PEAS</b>. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium (see <a href="amc_chkriceg1.html#04">Note-4</a>), then 
    run in a mini-prep food processor (or by whatever means you have) 
    until very fine. Add just enough water to do the job. Pour off 
    any free water when done.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> for just a couple of minutes over moderate heat.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry, stirring frequently, for about 15 
    minutes. It will not be browned, and there should be very little 
    browning to the bottom of the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then stir 
    in <b>Rice</b>, <b>Carrot mix</b> and <b>Cilantro</b>.  Cover 
    tightly and simmer over very low heat for 15 to 20 minutes until 
    Rice is done. Uncover <u>once only</u> about 2/3 way through, stir 
    it up and check progress.</li>
  <li>When done, turn off heat and let rest for 10 minutes without 
    uncovering to properly finish rice.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> American long grain rice is often used in South 
  America, both imported or grown locally, but I prefer Thai Jasmine, 
  so that's what I have on hand.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless chicken meat 
  with fat removed - leg and thigh recommended for best 
  flavor and texture. The pattern recipe called for chicken parts cut 
  into serving pieces, in which case you would need 1 pound. I find 
  boneless chunks of chicken meat easier to deal with, especially in a 
  buffet setting.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Aji:</h3> &nbsp; The proper chili in Chile is the yellow 
  Aji Amarillo. Those are still nearly impossible to get 
  fresh in North America, even here in Los Angeles. Frozen and whole 
  canned (or jarred) are available. Aji paste is the most easily 
  available form, locally or ordered on the Internet. Aji Amarillo is 
  not very hot, the given amount is barely perceptable heatwise. Use 
  whatever you have available and use your own best judgement for 
  amount. for details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html">
  <b>South American Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for chopped medium and lightly 
  packed, measured before processing. You can use quite a bit of stem 
  in this, I break off the stems below the lower leaves. Exact 
  measurement is not critical as recipes vary widely as to how green 
  it should be. The amount given here leaves it moderately colored.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a little less than the amount 
  you would normally use for you rice, to compensate for the water 
  included with the Cilantro mix and soaking rice. Don't use too much - 
  it's annoying, but possible to correct for a touch too 
  little by cautiously adding some boiling water and cooking a few more 
  minutes, but impossible to recover from too much.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This dish can be reheated in 
  the oven and will be satisfactory, but is at its best served 
  right after it's made. It can be made a day ahead through step 6, 
  then refrigerated overnight. For buffet it can be made in and served 
  from an electric skillet.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes call for frying the Chicken 
  lightly browned in the oil, after which it is removed and 
  set aside. For this method the "Rub" ingredients go in with the rice, 
  and the Chicken is returned to the pot at that time as well. There is 
  a tendency, even in Peru, to lighten up on the frying.</li>
