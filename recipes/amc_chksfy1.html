This stir fry reveals the strong Asian influence in Brazil. 
Xadrez is the name for Chess in Brazil, referring to ingredients cut into 
1 inch square. My example is not so neatly squared to minimize waste.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into squares about 1 inch on a side by whatever 
    thickness it is.</li>
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>CASHEWS</b> until lightly browned. They will be 
    unevenly browned, but will have a very different flavor and texture 
    from commercially roasted.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.
    Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin. Cut slices into narrow 
    strips, then cut the strips crosswise into tiny dice. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Core <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> and cut into 1 inch squares.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOM STEMS</b> flush, then cut Mushrooms crosswise into 
    circles about 3/16 inch thick. Cut slices in half if too large.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b></li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Season <b>Chicken</b> with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and 1/2 t 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Massage it in well.</li>
  <li>In a Wok or spacious Skillet, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Chicken</b> over high heat, tumbling often until lightly browned 
    all over. Make sure the fond that adheres to the pan doesn't get 
    too dark (reddish brown is OK, chocolate brown is getting too dark). 
    Remove and set aside (it may not be cooked fully through).
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring over high heat about 2 
    minutes. Stir in <b>Bell Peppers</b> until well coated with oil, 
    then stir in the <b>Mushrooms</b>. Fry stirring another 2 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and continue to fry stirring for a few 
    minutes until it is thoroughly hot.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock mix</b> and continue to cook until the sauce 
    has thickened and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cashews</b> and simmer another 1 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless 
  chicken meat. The pattern recipe called for breast, but I use leg and 
  thigh meat for better flavor and texture than the cardboard breasts 
  we get around here. Those don't slice as neatly into squares as breast, 
  but I'm willing to make that compromise.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms can 
  be used, or consider some of the small Giant Trumpet Mushrooms now 
  common (at least here in Southern California) with stems about 1-1/4 
  inches diameter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Mushrooms and Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
