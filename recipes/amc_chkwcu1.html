  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 minutes + marinate time)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite size pieces (or leave thighs and 
    legs whole if serving that way).</li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Chicken</b> lightly with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Let 
    rest while you do the rest of Prep.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 3/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice into 1/4 inch rounds. Mix with 
    Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>BELL PEPPER</b> and cut into 1/4 by 1-1/2 inch strips.
    Mix with Tomatoes.</li>

  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise, then slice fairly thin 
    crosswise.</li>

  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - 35 min if using whole joints)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart) or similar, heat <b>Oil</b>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless for buffet 
  service, but skin-on and bone in is fine for table service. Thigh Meat and 
  Leg Meat are highly preferred for flavor and texture. 4 pounds of thighs 
  yielded about 2-1/2 pounds of meat. The pattern recipe called for one whole 
  Chicken weighing 4 pounds, cut into 6 or 8 pieces, but this causes cause 
  severe inequality at the table. If you want to serve skin-on, bone-in use 
  Thighs and/or Drumsticks, about 4 pounds.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; I make a strong broth from the skins, bones, and 
  fat I remove from the thighs. I strain the Broth, then defat it with my 
  gravy separator. If you don't have Chicken or Vegetable broth 
  on hand, fake it up with some <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html">
  <b>Chicken Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Chile grows about 2/3 of it's rice consumption, and 
  imports 1/3. The rice grown in Chile is Japonica (like California rice), as 
  Chile is too cold for Indica rice. That imported is long grain Indica, 
  so you can use either type as you choose.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  The amount of liquid can vary a lot, though the 
  1 cup of wine stays the same. I use up to 1 cup of broth, good for serving 
  alone with rice. If doing whole joints, you can reduce the liquid to just 
  the wine. This dish reheats very well, and (with cut meat) is suitable 
  for buffet service.</li>
