This Fish Stew from Bahia in northern Brazil is lighter than the very 
intense <a href="amf_vatapa1.html"><b>Vatap&aacute;s</b></a> of the 
Afro-Brazilian cuisine, but is certainly a good main dish stew, served 
with rice.

  <p>This recipe can be made hours ahead up to adding the fish, or a 
  finished soup can be reheated easily if the chosen fish holds up fairly 
  well to wet cooking.</p>

  <b><u>Marinade</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop all <b>MARINADE</b> aromatics fine and mix with 
    <b>Dend&ecirc; Oil</b> and <b>Olive Oil</b> in a wide bowl.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into largish bite size pieces. Tumble them with 
    the Marinade in the wide bowl. Pack in a plastic bag, making 
    sure the Marinade is well distributed among the fish. Squeeze all 
    air out of the bag and seal it. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, 
    turning the bag now and then.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep Vegies</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> and <b>SCALLION</b> small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise 
    very thin, then chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Blast both <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
    off skin under running water (see <a href="amf_fshstw1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). 
    Core and dice about 1/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PALM HEARTS</b> about 1/4 inch thick. Add to Tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Bring out the <b>Fish</b> and place into a bowl with all the 
    <b>Marinade</b>. Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b> and pour over the fish.
    </li>
  <li>Heat <b>Dend&ecirc; Oil</b> in a  3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or 
    similar. Fry <b>Onion mix</b> and <b>Bell Peppers</b> until 
    onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in <b>Coconut 
    Milk</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Season with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.Bring back to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, 
    cover and simmer about 10 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Transfer the <b>Fish</b> and <b>Marinade</b> to the pan.  Bring 
    to a simmer and simmer until the fish flakes well and the marinade 
    onions are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>. Bring up hot and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This can be any light 
  colored non-oily fish that holds together reasonably well in wet 
  cooking. It is properly ocean fish, but fresh water fish can also be 
  used. The photo example was made with Pacific Ocean Whitefish 
  (Pacific Tilefish), which is not ideal for wet cooking, but it worked 
  well enough.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dend&ecirc; Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is a bright 
  orange Palm Oil available from some African or Brazilian markets or 
  on-line. For details see  our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> page. 
  The dish will not be ruined if you have to use the much more available 
  coconut oil, especially if you color it with
  <a href="../ingred/sp_annattz.html"><b>Annatto</b></a>, which is easy 
  to do.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This need not be made from 
  the fish used in the recipe. I've usually made the stock well ahead, 
  often from Golden Pompano, and used the fillets for other purposes. 
  For details of making and keeping fish stock, see our recipe for 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did not call for this 
  step, but, since my recipes tend to get reheated at least once, and I 
  don't like loose skins floating around, I skin them.</li>
