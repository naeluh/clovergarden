<p>The most traditional version is made with just shrimp and salt cod, 
but it is also often made with fish, shrimp and salt cod, as in this 
recipe, and sometimes with chicken, shrimp and salt cod.</p>

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (24 hrs - 1-1/8 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>SALT COD</b> at least 24 hours in multiple changes of cold 
    water in the refrigerator (or see <a href="amf_vatapa1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Dry pan roast raw <b>PEANUTS</b> and <b>CASHEWS</b> until speckled 
    brown and tasting roasted (stop eating them!). Cool well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (24 hrs - 1-1/8 hr work)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Drop <b>Salt Cod</b> into boiling water. When it comes back to a 
    simmer, simmer for 4 to 6 minutes, depending on thickness. Drain, 
    let cool, and shred small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces of the desired size, 1-1/2 inch on a 
    side is usually good.</li>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and de-vein as needed. If quite large, cut into 
    2 equal weight pieces.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>In a mini-prep food processor reduce <b>Dried Shrimp</b> and 
   <b>Dried Chilis</b> to powder, then add <b>Peanuts</b> and 
   <b>Cashews</b>. Process until you have a fine dry paste (the Shrimp 
   and Chilis will keep the nuts from gumming up the works).</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and dice small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Dice <b>GREEN CHILI</b> small. Slice 
    <b>SCALLIONS</b> fairly thin crosswise. Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> and 
    <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Break up <b>BREAD</b> quite small and mix with <b>Coconut Milk</b>. 
    Mash when well soaked.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Heat <b>Dend&ecirc; Oil</b> in a  3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or 
    similar and fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent, about 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b> and fry stirring until Tomatoes 
    are well softened, about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, <b>Salt Cod</b>, <b>Bread mix</b>, 
    <b>Thickeners</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a simmer 
    and simmer, stirring often, over low flame for about 20 minutes. 
    Add more stock if needed. Don't worry about the bread being a bit 
    lumpy, that's fine. Do use caution with the heat and stir from the 
    bottom as the nuts tend to stick to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> and simmer 5 minutes over the same low heat, 
    then stir in <b>Shrimp</b> and simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; This can be any light 
  colored non-oily fish that holds together reasonably well in wet 
  cooking. It is properly ocean fish, but fresh water fish can also be 
  used. The photo example was with Tilapia, which is what happened to 
  be in my freezer compartment, and it worked fine. For serving guests, 
  I'd use <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html"><b>Golden Pompano</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt Cod:</h3> &nbsp; This can be found most easily in Italian 
  markets. While included in almost every recipe, it is sometimes 
  omitted in home cooking due to expense and inconvenience, but don't 
  omit it if at all possible. Salted Pollock, now widely distributed by 
  Goya, is a lower cost, easier to find, and easier to use substitute, 
  though not up to Cod standards. If you can't include it, increase 
  the amount of fresh fish fillet to compensate.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is whole if 
  very small, lightly crumbles if large. These can be found in any Asian, 
  Mexican or South American market. Some recipes call for a little less 
  than the amount given here, others for a <u>whole</u> <u>lot</u> more. 
  This is a powerful flavoring, so use caution, but the amount I have 
  included is what I consider the absolute minimum. Feel free to 
  increase, but be sure you know what you are doing. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Thai chilis or de Arbols (not as 
  hot but larger) for noticeable heat, Japones for milder. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One Serrano works fine here. Adjust 
  hotness by adding more if you wish, but be sure you know what you 
  are doing.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bread:</h3> &nbsp; This should be white French, 
  Italian or similar. Weight is after trimming crusts. If the crust is 
  very thin, as on a small French baguette, it can be left on, but I've 
  found my "Y" shaped vegetable peeler quickly and easily removes the 
  crust from a day old baguette with almost no loss of weight.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Dend&ecirc; Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is a bright orange 
  palm oil available from some African or Brazilian markets or on-line.
  Some recipes call for frying the Onions in Dend&ecirc; Oil, some call 
  for using a regular oil and stirring in 2 T Dend&ecirc; Oil at finish. 
  I see no reason not to take the first approach for this recipe. For 
  details see   our <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html">
  <b>Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> page. The dish will not be ruined if you 
  have to use the much more available coconut oil, especially if you 
  color it with <a href="../ingred/sp_annattz.html"><b>Annatto</b></a>, 
  which is easy to do.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This need not be made from 
  the fish used in the recipe. I've usually made the stock well ahead, 
  often from Golden Pompano, and used the fillets for other purposes. 
  For details of making and keeping fish stock, see our recipe for 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Soaking Cod:</h3> &nbsp; I have cut this down to 
  less than 8 hours by slicing fairly thin (it's going to be crumbled 
  small anyway) and soaking at room temperature with a fair number of 
  changes of cold water. Yes, the guy from the FDA would have a seizure, 
  but it's still a bit salty, the water is changed frequently and it's 
  going to be at 212&deg;F for a half hour. Bacteria are not going to 
  survive this.</li>
