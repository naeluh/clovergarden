One of the most famous dishes of Brazil, this stew is cooked in vast 
quantities on Saturdays, particularly in Rio de Janeiro. Amounts given 
here can be considered to be for a "half recipe", making a mere 12 cups 
(3 quarts).

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BEANS</b> overnight or at least 6 hours with 1/2 T 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Water</b> to cover. Drain and rinse.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> using <b>CARNE SECA</b>, similarly soak it overnight 
    in several changes of water.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Slice <b>LINGUI&Ccedil;A</b> about 1/2 inches thick. If using 
    a sausage larger than 1-1/2 inch diameter, first slice it in half 
    lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into dice about 1/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>MEATS</b>. Cut them into largish bite 
    size pieces. If using bony meats like Ox Tails, Pig Feet, Ham Hocks 
    and Pig Tails, they have to go in as large pieces, but you will 
    remove the meat and discard the bones when the stew is nearly done.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop remaining <b>AROMATICS</b> small. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Fry Meats</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a skillet, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Lingui&ccedil;a</b> 
    until moderately browned all over. Remove from the pan. Similarly 
    fry each of the <b>Meat items</b>, adding more Oil if needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a Dutch Oven or heavy bottomed pot (4 or 5 quart), heat 1 T 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Bacon</b> stirring over moderate heat 
    until getting crispy.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Fry stirring 
    until Onions are threatening to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b> until it is well incorporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beans</b> and all <b>Meat items</b>. Pour in 
    <b>Water</b> to cover it all (about 6 cups for bony meats, 5 for 
    boneless). Bring to a boil, then cover and hold at a low simmer for 
    about 2-3/4 hours, stirring a couple of times. Skim off any foam 
    that rises to the surface and maintain the Water so everything is 
    just covered.</li>
  <li>When Beans are tender, but not mushy, (about 2-3/4 hours) fish 
    out meats with bones. Strip the meat and return it to the pot. In 
    the case of Ham Hocks, return the meat but not the rind and fat.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Return to a simmer for 
    15 minutes or so. If you want it thicker, you can crush some of the 
    beans against the side of the pot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Orange Slices</b> (on the side or as Garnish). 
    Accompany with steamed <b>Rice</b>, <b>Collard Greens</b> and 
    <b>Farofa</b>. See <a href="amm_bbnmt1.html#07"><b>Service</b></a> for details.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Small black beans are usually used, even in 
  regions that don't usually use black beans, except in Bahia and 
  Goi&aacute;s where red or brown beans are sometimes used. This dish 
  is best made from dried beans soaked overnight with salt, but if you 
  don't have the time you can use a "quick brine" (for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried 
  Beans</b></a> page. Use fresh dried beans as old ones will never 
  become tender.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lingui&ccedil;a:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes in English call for 
  Chori&ccedil;o, but Portuguese and Spanish Chori&ccedil;os available 
  in North America are rather dry, and  Lingui&ccedil;a is more 
  appropriate for a stew. Brazil has a couple sausages called 
  "Lingui&ccedil;a, but Lingui&ccedil;a Calabresa is <u>not</u> the 
  one to use. If you can't find the other one, use Portuguese 
  Lingui&ccedil;a, pretty much the same thing. Whatever you do, <u>do 
  not</u> try to use Mexican Chorzo, as some recipes suggest. It is 
  <u>totally</u> different from anything used in Brazil. A quality 
  Polish Kielbasa would be a much better choice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; A few recipes call for Pancetta, but I favor 
  a good smoked slab bacon as we need more smoky flavor in this recipe.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Meats:</h3> &nbsp; 1 pound weight is for all boneless meats - if 
  using bony meats you may need up to 2 pounds. Brazilian recipes call 
  for many salted meats, but in Brazil (and Europe) pig feet, ears, 
  tongues, snouts and tails are salted, and salt dried Carne Seca is 
  easily available. In North America, all those pig parts are sold 
  fresh, and salt dried beef is not common, so we must use mostly fresh 
  meats. In Brazil, a smoky flavor is often preferred, so a small smoked 
  ham hock would be a good item to include. Typical meats are:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Pork Baby Back Ribs</b></li>
  <li><b>Pork Tails</b></li>
  <li><b>Pig Ears</b></li>
  <li><b>Pig Feet</b></li>
  <li><b>Pig Tongues</b></li>
  <li><b>Pig Snouts</b></li>
  <li><b>Smoked Pork Loin</b></li>
  <li><b>Smoked Ham Hocks</b></li>
  <li><b>Ham (diced)</b></li>
  <li><b>Pork, lean</b></li>
  <li><b>Carne Seca</b>  - see recipe <a href="aim_cowdry1.html">
      <b>Dried Beef</b></a> - (soak overnight for use).</li>
  <li><b>Ox Tails</b></li>
  <li><b>Beef Tongue</b> - usually salted and/or smoked</li>
  <li><b>Beef Short Ribs</b></li>
  <li><b>Beef, lean</b></li>
  </ul>
  Markets serving Philippine, East European or Hispanic communities are 
  where to look for most of this stuff. The photo example was made with 
  Ox Tails, Pig Tails, Smoked Pork Loin, Pork Tongue and Portuguese 
  Lingui&ccedil;a.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This is optional, but it does lighten the 
  flavor of bean dishes. I use Sherry Vinegar, but others will work fine 
  as well, though I'm not fond of cider vinegar in recipes.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Slow Cooker:</h3> &nbsp; I do not cook in a slow cooker, I am too 
  impatient and too much of a control freak. On the other hand, I do, 
  with recipes of this sort, sometimes use a slow cooker <u>after</u> 
  bringing the whole recipe to a full boil on the stovetop. I then dump 
  it into a slow cooker set to High, and when it starts to bubble I turn 
  it down to Low. It will still take a bit longer, but the results will 
  be good. For "slow cooker all the way" I have seen comments that beans 
  were not tender enough after 6 hours, so figure 8 to 10 hours.</li>  
<li id="07">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; The way this stew is served in Brazil is quite 
  standardized. It is usually served at leisurely events, particularly 
  on Saturdays. The accompaniments and garnishes are very standardized 
  as well. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Orange Slices:</b> &nbsp; These are very traditional, and 
      supposed to help digestion. I would serve them on the side, 
      especially for buffet service.</li>
    <li><b>Rice:</b> &nbsp; This should be a plain steamed white rice 
      (Thai Jasmine works great). In Brazil they usually serve the 
      Feijoada <u>over</u> the rice, but I prefer serving it beside 
      the rice so I can mix in my own proportions and renew one or the 
      other separately.</li>
    <li><b>Farofa:</b> &nbsp; While always included as a side to this 
      stew in Brazil, it's a bit of a problem in North America.  
      Manioc Farina is much less available here than the other 
      ingredients we have listed. Manioc Flour is not acceptable (too 
      fine). Farofa is easy to make by our recipe 
      <a href="asv_farof1.html"><b>Farofa</b></a>.</li>
    <li><b>Collard Greens:</b> &nbsp; [Couve Mineira Refogada] &nbsp; 
      This is an almost essential side dish in Brazil for any rich 
      or meaty main dish. Fortunately, it's very easy to make by our 
      recipe <a href="asv_colla1.html"><b>Collard Greens</b></a>.
      and can be made even days ahead as it reheats just fine.</li>
    <li><b>Cheiro Verde:</b> &nbsp; This is just Parsley and Scallions 
      (or Chives) chopped small. If you want a recipe, we have 
      <a href="aiv_cheiv1.html"><b>Cheiro Verde:</b></a> (ignore the 
      variations).</li>
      </ul>
<li id="08">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Many writers presume this originated as a 
  slave dish, based on beans and pork "scraps" (ears, feet, tails, 
  tongues, etc.), but historians disagree. Those "scraps" (to Americans) 
  were held in high regard by Euorpeans of that time, and in many regions 
  to this day. This stew is closely related to similar stews in Portugal 
  and other parts of Europe, thought to be based on stews made by the 
  Roman Legions. The first written recipes from Brazil are from the mid 
  19th century and were directed to the upper classes. Slaves ate their 
  beans with manioc flour.</li>
