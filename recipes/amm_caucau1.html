A traditional Peruvian dish. Presumably the Incas would make it from 
llama tripe (llamas are related to camels). The tripe can be cooked and 
cut a couple days ahead and refrigerated.

broth.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hours - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>TRIPE</b> in a pot with <b>Water</b> to cover. Add 1/2 t 
    <b>Salt</b> and a couple of <b>Lemon slices</b> or a little Citric 
    Acid.  Bring to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes. Drain and 
    rinse. Again cover with <b>Water</b> with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and a 
    couple <b>Lemon slices</b>. Simmer until it reaches the desired 
    chewiness. This depends on your tripe and may be 1-1/4 hours or up 
    to 1-3/4 hours. It must not be cooked until mushy.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Tripe</b>, but <u>Reserve two cups of the <b>Broth</b></u>. 
    Cut the tripe into 3/4" squares.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes about 1/2" to 3/4". Hold 
    in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse. Chop <b>ONION</b> medium. Chop 
    <b>CHILI</b> small. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>MINT</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and <b>Cumin</b> until onions are translucent 
    but not browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tripe</b>, <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Turmeric</b> and 2 c 
    <b>Broth</b>. Simmer until Potatoes are cooked, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Peas</b> and <b>Mint</b>. Bring back to a simmer and 
    take off heat. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: If preparing in advance, do this 
    step just before serving to avoid discoloring.</li>
  <li>Serve with Rice. Include some of the broth with each serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe presumes tripe as found in Southern 
  California markets, cleaned, bleached, parboiled and ready to cook. 
  The recipe weight presumes Blanket Tripe which will be about 1/2 that 
  weight when cooked to the right chewiness. Honeycomb Tripe will shrink 
  a little more, and Book Tripe may be as little as 1/3, so adjust to 
  suite. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html">
  <b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. White potatoes are used in Peru, but they have 200 
  varieties there, none of which are available here. Avoid Yukon Gold 
  type potatoes, they disintegrate into mush with even moderately 
  long cooking.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; In Peru they use moderately hot, orange Aji 
  Amarillo chilis, which have a unique flavor, but those are near 
  impossible to get in North America. My Aji Amarillo plants had no 
  chilis when I made the photo example. Around here every ethnicity 
  uses red ripe Fresno chilis, so that is what I used. Some recipe call 
  for Aji Amarillo paste, which is reasonably available here in Southern 
  California. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_samz.html">
