Tender veal and lamb kidneys are very popular in Argentina - but here 
I've made it from beef kidneys (see <a href="amm_cowkid1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). 
The method and other ingredients are the same, but the result is a bit 
different.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; In Argentina this dish is usually made from 
  tender veal or lamb kidneys. Veal kidneys don't appear in the markets 
  I shop at, and lamb kidneys are absurdly expensive, so I usually use 
  beef kidneys, though pork kidneys would be a better match to lamb 
  kidneys. The beefs our kidneys come from are quite young, so they work 
  well. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a>, 
  <a href="../ingred/as_kidneyz.html"><b>Lamb Kidneys</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_kidneyz.html"><b>Pork Kidneys</b></a> pages. 
  </li>
<li id="02">
<h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Red or White Rose potatoes 
  will work well here and will hold their shape well. Yukon Gold type 
  potatoes can be used, cubing them after boiling, but take care you 
  don't overcook them as they quickly go to mush. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03"><h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; While the original lamb / veal 
  kidney dish was meant to be served immediately, I have used my 
  version as a buffet dish. It should be finished as given, then 
  transfered to a slow cooker and kept on the "keep warm" setting only.
