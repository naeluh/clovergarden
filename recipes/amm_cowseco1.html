Typical of the <i>Comida Criolla</i> of coastal Peru, Secos are very 
popular. they are usually made from beef, chicken or goat, but it's 
not unheard of to use other meats, or fish, or just vegetables.

<p>As shown in the photo, the ingredients are cut for buffet service, 
see <a href="amm_cowseco1.html#05"><b>Service</b></a> for table service.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into 1-1/2 inch cubes (larger for table service).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cube about the same size as the Beef. 
    Hold in cold water until needed.</li> 
  <li>Pull <b>CILLANTRO</b> leaves from larger stems. Measure is tightly 
    packed - err on the high side. Place in a blender with 1/3 
    cup water and blend to a liquid.</li>
  <li>Thaw <b>PEAS</b>. Measure is thawed.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>CUMIN</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 4 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Beef</b> over high heat, tumbling until medium browned. I use 
    a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan and fry in two batche. A coverable 
    wok would also work fine. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 2 T <b>Oil</b>, heat and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring until 
    light golden. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring until it is 
    lightly colored.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Aji Amarillo Paste</b>, then <b>Cilantro</b>, 1 cup 
    <b>Water</b>, <b>Cumin</b> and <b>Beef</b>. Season with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer covered 45 minutes or until Beef is very 
    tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>. bring to a boil and simmer covered for 
    another 20 minutes. Adjust liquid as needed, despite the name 
    "seco" there should be enough sauce to spoon over the meat.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Peas</b> and simmer another 2 minutes (5 minutes for 
    fresh peas).</li>
  <li>Serve hot, accompanied by Steamed Rice and/or mashed Peruano 
    Beans.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Any flavorful stewing cut will do fine. Round 
  will take longer to cook tender than Chuck, which I prefer.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose is a good choice here. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes as they turn to mush if cooked just a little 
  long. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; That's a lot of Cilantro, but it's a key 
  ingredient, so don't under-buy. Unlike parsley it's permissible to use 
  smaller stems with Cilantro. Measure is packed firm, but it's springy 
  and not easy to measure, so err on the generous side. In some recipes, 
  some Spinach leaves are added with the Cilantro to make a greener 
  sauce. Chili leaves would also work for this (they are not hot).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Aji Amarillo Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Aji Amarillos (Peruvian 
  Yellow Chilis) are very difficult to find in North America, but many 
  markets serving a South American community will have the paste. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_ajiyz.html">
  <b>Aji Amarillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; As shown, this dish was cut 
  for buffet service. For table service, the Meat is usually cut into 
  larger 2 to 2-2/2 inch chunks, requiring a little more cooking time. 
  The Potatoes are cut large to match. The plate also usually includes 
  a scoop of white rice and a scoop of mashed Peruano Beans (Canary 
  Beans). A spoon of the sauce is poured over the meat and potatoes.
