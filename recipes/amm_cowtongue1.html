Most beef tongue recipes are for appetizers and sandwich slices, but this 
one, is a main course stew. It is delightfully tasty and was the star of 
the show at a recent buffet party.

<p>This recipe takes a few hours, but it isn't at all hard to do. It can 
be made eve a couple days ahead.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>TONGUE</b> well, first in cold water, then in warm water. 
    Drain well.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Tongue</b> in a pot with water to cover well (it'll swell up). 
    Bring to a boil and simmer until done, about 1 hour for every pound the 
    tongue weighs. Test with a sharp skewer, it should feel the same 
    resistance all the way through the thickest part.</li> 
  <li>Fish <b>Tongue</b> out of the pot and cool in it running water just 
    enough so you can handle it, then peel off the skin (much easier when 
    still hot). Return it to the pot to cool in the broth.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Set to marinade in 
    <b>White Wine</b> until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and chop fairly small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch chunks. Cook in boiling 
    salted water until just done through.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice 1/8 inch crosswise. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> 
    small. Mix together with <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>When <b>Tongue</b> is cold, slice it about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 
    largish bite size pieces.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Mushrooms</b> well, retaining the wine.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b>, 
    stirring over decreasing heat until medium brown. When nearly done, stir 
    in <b>Garlic</b> and continue to fry stirring until it takes some color.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Aromatic mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    over moderate heat until Tomatoes are very soft and moisture is nearly 
    gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b>, then <b>Tongue</b> until well mixed. Then 
    stir in <b>Wine</b> and <b>Water</b>. simmer covered about 20 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Adjust liquid to your preference (see <a href="amm_cowtongue1.html#02">Note-2</a>) and 
    stir in <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring back to a simmer until Potatoes are 
    warmed through.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with rice or bread.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tongue:</h3> &nbsp; A beef tongue can weigh from 3 to 4 pounds. 
  Veal tongues weigh about 1-1/2 pounds and take significantly less time 
  to cook. Some say the tongue will be easier to peel if you whack it 
  well on a hard surface before cooking.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tonguez.html"><b>Beef Tongue / Veal 
  Tongue</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Serving, etc.:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe author thickens the 
  stew with 2 T of cornstarch - but neglects to say when or how much 
  liquid to put in to make it into stew (duh!). Since I serve this 
  buffet style with the potatoes included in the stew rather than 
  separately, I find no thickening is needed and add none. Use your own 
  best judgement.</li>
