<p>This recipe is sized to fill an 8 quart pot.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 hrs - 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> of all fat and membranes (do not discard). Cut 
    into cubes about 1-1/2 inches to a side.</li>
  <li>In a large iron skillet, fry <b>SHANK SLICES</b> in a little oil 
    until medium browned on both sides. Remove from the skillet and set 
    aside. Do the same with the <b>Beef Cubes</b>, remove, drain and set 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil. Toss in <b>Beef Trimmings</b> and 
    any bones you may have. Bring back to a boil for a couple minutes 
    and pour out into the sink. Clean the pot, rinse the trimmings, put 
    back in the pot with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Turn 
    down the heat and simmer for an hour or two.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Beef Shanks</b>, bring back to a boil. Turn down the heat and 
    simmer slowly for about 3 hours (see <a href="amm_cozido1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>)
    </li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Shanks</b> and remove the meat from the bones. Break 
    the meat into serving chunks and set aside. If you have time, toss 
    the bones, tendons and membranes back into the pot and simmer another 
    couple of hours.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Meanwhile:</u></b>
  <ol start="6"> 
  <li>Cut the <b>HAM</b> into dice about 1/2 inch on a side. Peel 
    <b>SAUSAGES</b> and cut into chunks of the size you want. Cut 
    <b>SMOKED PORK</b> into strips about 1 inch long by 1/2 x 1/4 inch. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into chunks about 1 inch long.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CHAYOTE</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks. Peel and 
    seed <b>WINTER SQUASH</b>.and cut into chunks about 1 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Stem <b>COLLARDS</b> and tear leaves into convenient to eat pieces.
    </li>
  <li>Core <b>CABBAGE</b> and cut into convenient chunks.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into chunks of the desired size. Peel 
    <b>SWEET POTATO</b> and chunk similarly. Hold both in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CORN</b> into chunks. I usually cut to 1-1/2 inches long, 
    then split in half. Use a razor sharp santoku or Chinese cleaver 
    knife and drive it through with a soft faced mallet, crosswise first.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>PLANTAINS</b>. Cut in half lengthwise and crosswise about 
    3/4 inch thick.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="15">
  <li>Strain all solids from the <b>Stock</b> and discard. De-fat the 
    stock (use your gravy separator).</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the stock to it. There should be 12 cups, 
    add water if needed. Stir in <b>Fried Beef</b>, bring to a boil and 
    simmer for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sausages</b>, <b>Smoked Pork</b>, <b>Onions</b>, 
    <b>Carrots</b>, <b>Collards</b>, <b>Cabbage</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer for 1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potato mix</b> and <b>Squash Mix</b>. Bring back to a 
    boil and simmer until potatoes are done, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Plantain</b> and  <b>Corn</b>. Bring back to a boil. 
    If stew is too thick add boiling water to suit.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing fat and membranes. 
  Shoulder Clod is what I usually use, but Round will work fine with 
  a little more cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Shank:</h3> &nbsp; This should be thick slices of center cut 
  shank with plenty of meat on them and bone in.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for chicken 
  backs and trimmings along with the beef. Others call for a Pig Foot 
  (pig feet are not salted in North America so do not need an overnight 
  soak as they would in Europe or Brazil).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Ham, Uncooked:</h3> &nbsp; In most locations what you'll be able 
  to get is Italian Prosciutto, which is fine, but if you live near a 
  big Asian market you may be able to score a slice of Virginia 
  (Smithfield) ham, also good. If available I buy a prosciutto 
  end at half the price per pound and use the skin too, diced.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; A mix of Pork and Beef sausages 
  is good. Chorizo Bilbao or other Spanish style cooking chorizo would be 
  fine here (but not hard cured chorizo and absolutely <u>NOT</u> Mexican 
  chorizo). Lacking that, Russian, Polish or Hungarian sausage will work.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sausage.html">
  <b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Smoked Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Many (non-Jewish) delis have smoked pork 
  loin or chops. In Brazil salted pork would probably be used, not 
  smoked.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Winter Squash:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes often call for "Pumpkin", but 
  the American Halloween pumpkin is <u>not</u> what they mean. Kabocha 
  is my favorite, but Acorn squash or similar is fine.</li>
<li id="8">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose and similarly waxy
  potatoes work well for recipes of this sort. Do <u>NOT</u> use Yukon 
  Gold or similar which turn to mush when cooked just a little long.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Sweet Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Use the white ones, not the orange 
  American "yam".</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Plantain:</h3> &nbsp; A ripe plantain looks like a severely 
  over-ripe banana. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/banana.html"><b>Bananas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Corn</h3> &nbsp;  Corn on the cob is a traditional 
  Brazillian touch, but I noticed in buffet service people were avoiding 
  it as cumbersome to deal with. Select the smallest ears you can find. 
  White or Yellow will do. If your guests have bad teeth, use corn 
  kernels.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In Brazil it is very important that the main 
  items are cut into largish chunks, one of each for each person who will 
  be at the table. At serving time they are distributed to the individual 
  bowls, liquid added and served. This method does not suit my needs, 
  since I'll more than likely be serving buffet style. To keep some yo-yo 
  from picking out all of what he likes, leaving none for others, I cut 
  the pieces smaller.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Reheating</h3> &nbsp; This recipe reheats very well. </li>
<li id="14">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; The Cozido of Portugal and the Cocido of 
  Spain are very similar, but the Spanish includes Chickpeas and the 
  Portuguise doen't. Both adapted from the <a href="hmm_sefrina1.html">
  <b>Sefrina / Adafina</b></a> of the Sephardic Jews. Forbidden to 
  cook on the Sabbath (cooking is considered work) they would prepare a 
  one-pot meal on Friday evening, which could be left to stay warm in 
  the kitchen embers and feed the family lunch on the next day. As with 
  most traditional recipes, ingredients vary, and the The Spanish / 
  Portuguese versions include ingredients forbidden to the Jews. Also, 
  there's nothing to keep non-Jews from finishing up the stew on the day 
  it is to be served, regardless of what that day might be. Our Gods and 
  Goddesses are on call all day every day (or as they please), and permit 
  work, on any day.</li>
