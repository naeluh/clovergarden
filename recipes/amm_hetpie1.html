  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 1/4 inch thick. Salt both sides lightly 
    and set out on a double paper towel to drain for about an hour. 
    Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CHEESE</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>HAM</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Whisk <b>SEMOLINA</b> with <b>Salt</b>. Make a well in the center 
    and stir in <b>Water</b> and <b>Oil</b>. Work until a dough is formed.
    </li> 
  <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until it is smooth and 
    not sticky.</li>
  <li>Divide the <b>Dough</b> in half. Roll out both haves into round disks 
    about 8 inches diameter. Set on a baking sheet, interleave and cover with 
    plastic wrap. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs + 25 min if you want the 
    browning step)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Preheat Oven to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Select a 9 inch pie pan, preferably non-stick.</li>
  <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of <b>Dough</b> to about 
    12 inches round and 1/8 inch thick. Place in Pie Pan and trim so dough 
    exceeds the rim by about 1/2 inch. Turn it up a bit to control the 
    eggs.</li>
  <li>Place 1/2 the <b>Ham</b> evenly over the dough. Evenly top with 1/2 the 
    <b>Cheese</b>. Place the other 1/2 of <b>Ham</b> over the Cheese, then 
    the other 1/2 the Cheese evenly on top.</li>
  <li>Layer <b>Tomatoes</b> in the pan, overlapping slightly.</li>
  <li>Lightly beat the 7 <b>EGGS</b> and pour over the pie. Sprinkle 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> over them.</li>
  <li>Roll out the other disk of <b>Dough</b> to the same size as the first. 
    place it over the pan and trim edges to match the first disk. Crimp the 
    edges together and tuck them down around the edge of the pan.</li> 
  <li>Crack remaining <b>Egg</b> into a small bowl and whip together with 
    <b>Cream</b>. Brush this mix on top of the Pie.</li>
  <li>Cut several 1 inch long slits in the top surface of the pie and slip 
    it into the preheated Oven. Bake until crust is golden and inside is 
    bubbling - Then remove from the oven.</li>
  <li><u>Optional</u>: &nbsp; Turn the Oven up to Broil. When about 
    500&deg;F/260&deg;C slide pie back in and leave until crust is browned, 
    2 or 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let rest a few minutes, then slide it out on your cutting board. 
    serve warm. If you cut it into fairly narrow wedges, it's easy to eat 
    by hand. Cutting it into wedges can be a bitch because the bottom will 
    be rather hard. As for all problems of this sort, my instant solution 
    is a <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife & 
    Mallet</b></a>. If made ahead, see <a href="amm_hetpie1.html#04"><b>Reheating</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Preferred are Beefsteak Tomatoes, as they are 
  large and without much liquid inside. Others can be used if well drained. 
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Monterey Jack Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; This cheese is favored because it 
  grates well (if cold), has good flavor, and melts smoothly. Another 
  Cheese with similar properties can be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for breaking the eggs over 
  the pie without breaking the yolks. I find the eggs slide around 
  uncontrollably, and the yolks get broken anyway. I lightly beat the 
  eggs so they will drain into the pie with less problem.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a restaurant dish, so a bit inconvenient 
  if you don't have a crew of highly trained peasants in the kitchen. 
  Fortunately, it can be made a day or three ahead and refrigerated wrapped 
  in plastic. I have made a couple of very minor changes to make things 
  easier.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Reheating:</h3> &nbsp; If made ahead, place it back into it's pie pan. 
    Cover with aluminum foil and slide in a cold oven. Turn the oven to 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. When the oven reaches 350&deg;, start monitoring it 
    - hopefully you have a good probe thermometer. Probably at about 45 to 50 
    minutes, the internal temperature will rise rather suddenly. You want to 
    get this thing out of the oven at about 150&deg;F/65&deg;C. Hotter will 
    stiffen it. Slide it out on the cutting board. The bottom won't be as 
    hard as if freshly baked, but the <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html">
    <b>Chinese Cleaver Knife & Mallet</b></a> will still make life easier.
