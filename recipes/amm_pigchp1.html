<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Chops:</h3> &nbsp; These should be largish 
  and fairly thick with a significant band of fat around the edge. See 
  also <a href="amm_pigchp1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>. This recipe can also be used 
  for Loin Steaks and more flavorful parts of the pig appropriately 
  cut. The photo example was a chop 1 inch thick (measured at the bone) 
  weighing 10 ounces.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheiro Verde:</h3> &nbsp; This is Brazil's all purpose garnish 
  and herb ingredient. It's just Scallions and Parsley, chopped small 
  and mixed in equal quantity. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="aiv_cheiv1.html"><b>Cheiro Verdi</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Collard Greens:</h3> &nbsp; [Couve Mineira Refogada] &nbsp; 
  This is an almost essential side dish in Brazil for any rich or meaty 
  main dish. Fortunately, it's very easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="asv_colla1.html"><b>Collard Greens</b></a>, and can 
  be made even days ahead as it reheats just fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cooking Pork</h3> &nbsp; Trichinosis and Tapeworm have been 
  eliminated from commercially produced, USDA inspected pigs, so a 
  little pink (usually up near the bones) is not a problem - 
  <u>Unless</u> you are eating a free range pig. Today, most cases 
  of trichinosis are from under-cooked bear and walrus.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe fried the chops in a 
  grill pan and finished them in a preheated 400&deg;F/200&deg;C oven 
  for 10 minutes to cook them through and get a more even browning. 
  Here in sunny Southern California we don't fire up an oven unless we 
  really need to (especially not for a 10 minute job). The photo example 
  was pan fried in a skillet. Note that if you  pan fry several in 
  sequence, each one will brown faster than the one before, so turn the 
  heat a little lower so they will cook through before they get too 
  brown.</li>
