  <p>You can start cooking this recipe in a 5 quart pot through step 
  15, but from 16 on you'll need a 8 quart pot.</p>
  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into chunks about 3/4 on a side and 2 to 2-1/2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into chunks a little larger than the Beef.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise, then slice crosswise fairly thin. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Cut <b>CELERY</b> crosswise fairly 
    thin. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>SWEET POTATOES</b>, and <b>POTATOES</b> Cut into pieces 
    a bit larger than the Beef. Mix and hold in cool water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CARROTS</b> into about 1 inch lengths. Add to Potatoes.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TURNIP</b> and cut into pieces a bit narrower than the 
    Sweet Potatoes. Add to Potatoes.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Peel, core and 
    dice about 3/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Shuck <b>CORN</b> and cut cobs as desired - see <a href="amm_pucher1.html#06">
    <b>Corn</b></a>. Add to Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>KABOCHA</b> (not strictly necessary) and cut into wedges. Cut 
    wedges into bite sized chunks. Add to Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SAUSAGE</b> into 1-1/2 to 2 inch lengths, and cut lengthwise 
    into sticks similar in size to the Beef.</li>
    
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs)
  <ol start=11>
  <li>Place <b>Beef</b> in a pot with water to cover well. Bring to 
    a boil for 2 minutes, then pour out in a clean sink. Clean the pot 
    and rinse the beef well to remove the crud. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In the pot, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b> and 
    fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Beef</b> to the pot, along with <b>Calf Foot</b> (if using),  
    <b>Parsley</b>, and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Add enough <b>Water</b> to just 
    cover. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for about 1-1/2 hours, or 
    until Beef is almost tender enough.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer another 30
    minutes, or until meats are tender.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Broth</b>. Pick out all chunks of <b>Meats</b> and dispose of 
    the debris. Set Meats aside. At this point the meats can be bagged 
    and refrigerated overnight.</li>
  <li>Defat <b>Broth</b> using your Gravy Separator.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and pour in the <b>Broth</b>. Drain <b>Root Vegies mix</b> 
    and stir into the pot. Add water if needed. Bring to a boil, then simmer 
    covered until roots are almost tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vegies mix</b>, <b>Sausages</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer covered until Kabocha 
    is tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Meats</b> and add some Water if needed, it doesn't have to 
    cover everything. Bring just to a boil.</li>
  <li>remove all solids to a platter and keep warm. (or see <a href="amm_pucher1.html#07">
    <b>Serving</b></a>).</li>
   <li>Serve hot, with some <b>Broth</b> (see <a href="amm_pucher1.html#07"><b>Broth</b></a>). 
    Provide Bread and Condiments, commonly Salt, Vinegar, Olive Oil, and 
    Prepared Mustard. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Brisket or Chuck can be used. Round would take 
  longer to cook.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This is generally thighs or leg joints or wing 
  joints, bone in. Breast has less flavor and a less pleasing texture, but 
  can be used. For buffet service I usually remove bones to make it easier 
  for folks standing around holding a dish. If using bone-in joints, put in 
  earlier than shown here, after about 1 hour.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; Argentine sausages are not commonly available 
  in North America, but you can use some other smoked sausage that doesn't 
  have a lot of chili in it. The photo example was with Kielbasa, quartered 
  lengthwise due to its size.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Calf Foot:</h3> &nbsp; This is traditional, but often left out, some 
  claiming unavailability, but they are widely available here in Southern 
  California, generally pre-cut into pieces. The Calf Foot is for the 
  Broth and is not served.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose is a good choice here. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes as they turn to mush if cooked just a little 
  long. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Corn:</h3> &nbsp; Argentine corn has larger kernels and is much less 
  sweet than ours - but we have to use what we can get. It is usually cut 
  into 2 inch lengths before adding to the stew. Serving buffet style, I've 
  noticed my guests avoid whole chunks of corn on the cob. They are difficult 
  to deal with in a buffet party context. I slice the cobs much shorter, 
  1 inch or a little more and cut the slices in half to make it convenient 
  to eat them with one hand.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; The Broth should always be well strained and defatted, 
  using your gravy separator. Many serve the broth separate, either as is or 
  made into a light soup with some other ingredients, particularly rice. Some 
  boil it down a bit to be more sauce-like. Some thicken it with flour and 
  pour it over the solids. </li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This is a complex dish, so it's best to do most 
  of it the previous day. Take care that nothing is overcooked.
  <ol>
  <li>Cut the <b>Meats</b> and cook them by the instructions through step 15 
    (defating Broth).</li>
  <li>Let the Meats cool, bag and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Root Vegies</b> to size, bag and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Vegies items</b>, bag and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>On serving day, just pick up from step 16. This will take about an hour. 
    <br>You could cut that down by also cooking the Root Vegies the day before 
    and refrigerating. </li>
  </ol> 
  </li>

<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, the solid ingredients are served 
  on a platter (no calf head required), and the broth is served separately. 
  Some serve Solids in a large bowl with a fair amount of broth. Some serve 
  the meat and vegetables in separate bowls, and a third bowl for a soup made 
  from the broth. I usually prepare this recipe for buffet service. I make 
  it as given in <a href="amm_pucher1.html#08"><b>Do Ahead</b></a>, place solids in a Electric 
  Skillet set to "Keep Warm", add a fair amount of broth, and cover until 
  guests are ready.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Puchero originated as a Spanish stew, and is very 
  popular in many Spanish speaking countries, particularly Spain, the 
  Philippines, Mexico, and Argentina. It is made quite differently in each 
  country. In Argentina, it was once very different indeed, a specialty of 
  nightclubs. Imagine a whole calf head on a platter, surrounded by piles of 
  sliced beef, chicken joints, sausages, corn on the cob, various root 
  vegetables, and "pumpkin" (similar to kabocha). Today, it's often a stew, 
  more similar to those of other countries, with complexity and mode of 
  presentation variable to suit the occasion.</li>
