  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 hrs - 10 min work))
  <ol>
  <li>Soak dried <b>BEANS</b> 8 hrs or overnight in 3 cups <b>Water</b> with 
    1/2 T <b>Salt</b> (yes, salt).</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Beans</b> and rinse. Simmer with <b>Bay Leaf</b> in 
    <b>Water</b> to cover until tender but still mostly intact, 30 to 50 
    minutes. Drain.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Remove thick stems from <b>COLLARDS</b>. Roll up a stack of leaf halves 
    into a sausage form, then cut thin crosswise. When released, cut a few 
    times across the strips to make them shorter.</li> 
  <li>Dice <b>BACON</b> fairly small.</li>  
  <li>Slice <b>SAUSAGES</b> a little less than 1/4 inch thick. If larger, like 
    Kielbasa, cut slices into half moons.</li>
  <li>For Garnish, chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>SCALLIONS</b>. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a bowl, beat <b>Eggs</b> moderately.</li>  
  <li>in a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3 quart), skillet, or wok, fry 
    <b>Bacon</b> over moderate heat until getting crisp. Stir in 
    <b>Sausage</b> and fry stirring another 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until translucent.</li>
  <li>Push everything off to one side of the pan. Pour <b>Eggs</b> into 
    the empty space. Fry, breaking up the eggs as they set to create shards 
    of egg - then stir everything together</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Collards</b> and fry stirring until coated with oil and 
    wilted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beans</b>. At this point you can stir in a Tablespoon or 
    so of water and cover the pan to warm up the beans without too much 
    stirring.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Manioc Farina</b> a little at a time until it is how you 
    like it. The Farina should get just a little moist. If doing ahead for 
    buffet, do this step just before serving.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley mix</b>. This dish is often served 
    with  Steamed Rice on the side, and a topping of 
    <a href="xam_chicher1.html"><b>Pork Rinds</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Carioca Beans:</h3> &nbsp; This is the dominant bean in Brazil, except 
  in the Rio de Janeiro region where black beans prevail. They are scarce in 
  North America, but can be had on-line. Otherwise, our Pinto Beans, though 
  significantly larger, have been extensively market tested in Brazil, and 
  have been found a suitable alternative. For details see our entry for 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_legumev.html#cario"><b>Carioca Beans</b></a>. The photo 
  example was made with Carioca Beans.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Collard Greens:</h3> &nbsp; [Couve (Portuguese)] &nbsp; The "Collards" 
  of Portugal, West Africa, and presumably southern Brazil, are a broad leafed 
  Kale. While it looks like our Collards, it is much more tender, but we 
  don't have broad leaf Kale in North America. Our Collards came from 
  Scotland, where you have to be really tough to be a leafy green, so 
  cutting into rather fine shreds is essential. For the photo example, my 
  local produce market didn't have Collards, but had plenty of non-curly 
  Tuscan Kale, which worked fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Calabrisa Sausage</h3> &nbsp; This sausage is native to Brazil, and 
  imperfectly available in North America. Other smoked sausages can be used, 
  like Spanish Chorizo (NOT Mexican) or Kielbasa (usually larger, so cut into 
  half moons. For details see our entry for 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html#lcal"><b>Lingui&ccedil;a Calabresa</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Manioc Farina</h3> &nbsp; This is a granular fermented Cassava meal, 
  which is essentially identical to West African Gari. Farina comes in plain 
  or toasted, while Gari is plain. Plain, in either case, needs to be dry pan 
  roasted until lightly colored for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html#gari"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page.
</li>

<li id="05">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Tropeiros were Drovers, of Mules, Horses and 
  Cattle, they who carried on the commerce of southern Brazil in the 17th 
  century, before there were any roads. Their recipe was composed of foods 
  that could be carried long distances, in hot weather, without refrigeration. 
  It originally included Dried Beef, one of the cargos carried by the 
  Tropeiros. Collards, of course, were not included, so this is a more modern 
  version, though the Tropeiros may have used local plants to ward off 
  scurvy. Several of my most trustworthy sources (most in Portuguese) call 
  for <i>Couve</i>, so I accept Collards as "authentic" for 21st century 
  Brazil. If you want to be more "original" you can leave them out, but to 
  be really original, you need to include dried beef.</li>
