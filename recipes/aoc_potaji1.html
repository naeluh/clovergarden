A very famous soup of Colombia. I have held the ingredients as used 
in Bogot&aacute;, but have modified the presentation for use on the buffet - 
see <a href="aoc_potaji1.html#08"><b>Serving</b></a> for details.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min )
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>Russets</b> and cut into 1/4 inch rounds. Peel <b>Yellow 
    Potatoes</b>, cut into 1/4 inch rounds and cut those into halves or 
    quarters depending on size. Peel <b>White Potatoes</b>, cut into 1/4 
    inch rounds, and cut those into halves or quarters, depending on size. 
    Mix all and hold in cool water until needed.</li>
  <li>Skin <b>CHICKEN</b> and remove excess fat. Leave bone-in and whole.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>SCALLIONS</b> to fit pot. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> moderately, Mix 
    both with <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a 4 or 5 quart pot, place all <b>Pot items</b> and and pour in 
    enough water to just cover it all. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam 
    that rises to the top. Turn to a fast simmer and simmer covered until the 
    chicken meat can be shredded, about 45 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> from the pot and set aside to cool. Remove and 
    discard <b>Scallions</b> and <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>
  <li>Continue to cook <b>Potatoes</b> until the Russets have dissolved, 
    and the soup is creamy. The other potatoes should have lost their sharp 
    corners and edges. This can take 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours depending in 
    you potatoes. You probably need to reduce the amount of liquid, and 
    this is the time to do it by cooking uncovered. When done, keep covered 
    until serving time.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Shred <b>Chicken</b> fairly fine and into lengths 
    up to 1-1/2 inches long (any longer they will be hard to eat with a 
    spoon). Hold until near serving time.</li>
  <li>At this point, everything can be held for awhile, or even cooled and 
    refrigerated to hold, overnight.</li>
  <li>About 15 minutes before serving time, reheat potato soup, stirring 
    often. Add <b>Corn Kernels</b> and <b>Guasca</b>. 
  <li>Cut <b>AVOCADOS</b> into wedges, and cut wedges into two or three 
    chunks.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>. Add boiling Water if needed for a not too thick 
    soup. Bring back to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Toppings</b>. Bring up hot, but not to a boil. Serve hot. 
    For buffet, pour into a slow cooker set to "keep warm".</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes, Russet:</h3> &nbsp; In Colombia, these would be 
  <i>Sabanera</i>, not available in North America. The Russets will 
  disintegrate into the soup, thickening it. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potato</b></a> page.
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes, Yellow:</h3> &nbsp; In Colombia, these would be <i>Criola</i>, 
  not available in North America. In North America, we can get Dutch Yellow 
  and Honey Gold (which I used). The Honey Gold is a bit more yellow than the 
  Dutch Yellow,  but I'm not sure either is as bright yellow as Criolas, and 
  they stay a bit more firm. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes, White:</h3> &nbsp; These give the soup texture. In Colombia, 
  these would be <i>Pastusa</i>, not available in North America. I find 
  White Rose or similar to work well as they stay reasonably firm, but not 
  too firm. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for bone-in breasts, 
  but Thighs have better flavor and texture than the stringy cardboard 
  flavor breasts we get in North America, so that's what I use.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Corn (Maize):</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 3 ears of corn 
  on the cob, cut crosswise in quarters, and cooked separately, to be served 
  beside or on top of the soup. This won't work at all well for buffet service, 
  even if cut into smaller sections. I use corn kernels mixed into the soup. 
  9 ounces is 2 cobs, or 1 15 ounce can. Frozen can also be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Guasca:</h3> &nbsp; In Colombia, this herb is considered essential for
  this soup. It is available dried on-line in North America. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/dy_guascaz.html"><b>Guasca</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Capers:</h3> &nbsp; For this recipe, the lower cost large capers are 
  preferred.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Colombia, especially in restaurants, the 
  Chicken is cooked and shredded as here, but is held aside. The Corn cobs 
  are cut crosswise into quarters, cooked separately, and held aside. The 
  Capers, Heavy Cream, and Avocado wedges are also held aside. These all 
  become toppings for the Potato Soup. This will not work for buffet 
  service, even if you explain it. Party guests never follow instructions, 
  they're too distracted, and some jerk will probably eat all the Chicken 
  and Avocado.</li>
