Frogs are much in demand in Uruguay and Argentina, and this elegant 
soup is an example of their use. The pattern recipe calls for a dozen 
whole frogs - not likely in Los Angeles.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Thaw <b>FROG LEGS</b>, separate into individual legs and cut off 
    bony toes if present. Rinse in several changes of water.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Onion</b> medium. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium.
    Chop <b>CARROT</b> small. Chop <b>Celery Leaves</b> medium. Mix all 
    with <b>Parsley</b> and <b>Basil</b> sprigs.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> fairly small. Chop <b>MUSHROOMS</b> medium. 
    Mix. </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or heavy bottomed sauce pan 
    heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring over moderate heat until vegetables are lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b> and fry stirring until Tomatoes are 
    well softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken Stock</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Wine</b>. Simmer 
    for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Soup</b>, discarding all solids.</li>
  <li>Return soup to the pot and bring to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Frog Legs</b>. 
    Cover and set to a simmer.</li>
  <li>When the <b>Frog Legs</b> are done, (20 to 25 minutes depending 
    on size) they will become disjointed and the meat will start to 
    fall from the bones. At this point, strain the soup again and set 
    the legs aside to cool some. When you can handle them, pick off 
    all the meat and shred it fine. Return the meat to the soup and 
    discard the bones.</li>
  <li>Bring back to a simmer. Stir in <b>Bread Crumbs</b>, then take off 
    the heat and stir in <b>Cr&ecirc;me Fraiche</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Frog Legs:</h3> &nbsp; One Asian market here in Los Angeles 
  does sometimes have live frogs, but is unlikely to have 10 of them. 
  We just don't have frog infested swamps here - so I have made some 
  adjustments (see <a href="aof_frog1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). For further notes 
  and possibilities see <a href="aof_frog1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Look in Asian 
  markets in the frozen food cases for bags of Frog Legs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/rp_frogz.html"><b>Frogs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Since we don't have the backs and liver 
  of the frogs as called for in the pattern recipe, I use more Chicken 
  Stock and less Water. Since Frog has a bit more of a fish flavor than 
  chicken, I use a little Thai fish sauce to correct for that. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cr&ecirc;me Fraiche:</h3> &nbsp; This lightly soured cream can be 
  found in places like Trader Joe's (sometimes). It is more stable in 
  heat than regular sour cream, but the regular kind can be used with 
  care.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is a little tedious 
  (disassembling and shredding the frog legs) but it can be made and 
  refrigerated even days ahead - up to stirring in the Cream. As given, 
  the recipe will provide an elegant soup course for about 6, but it 
  can be adapted easily as a main dish soup or for buffet service. I 
  cube about 12 ounces of White Rose potatoes about 1/2 inch and simmer 
  them until done. These are stirred in a little before serving. For 
  color I add 1/2 cup frozen peas. These go in just before serving so 
  their color is still bright green. See 
  <a href="aof_frog1x.html#gal"><b>Photo</b></a>. Actually, I like this 
  version better than without the potatoes and peas.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Historical:</h3> &nbsp; I originally found this recipe in 
  <i>Argentina Cooks!</i> (ac!37 &copy;2001), but later found the exact 
  same recipe in the earlier <i>South American Cookbook</i> (sacb5 1939) 
  attributing it to Uruguay. The only difference was increasing the 
  number of mushrooms from 2 to 4, presumably to negate copyright.</li>
