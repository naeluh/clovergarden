This fish soup was made famous by Pablo Neruda in his poetry. In Spain, 
the name of this dish would mean a light broth with European Eel, but 
in Chile it is a stew made with a sort of eel-like fish, the Congrio.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>FISH</b> as needed and cut into largish bite size chunks.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and slice 1/4 inch thick. Leave whole if 
    very small, or cut into pieces if larger (smaller pieces for 
    buffet than for family dinner). Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> (if used) 1 minute in boiling water. Quench 
    in cold water, peel skins and and chop coarse. Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> 
    lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    fine. Mix all.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. 
  <li>Use a vegetable peeler to peel off a few strips of 
    <b>LEMON PEEL</b> (yellow only) about 1-1/2 inch long by 1/2 inch 
    wide.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small. Mix with dried <b>Oregano</b>. </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Assembly</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min - can be done a few hours 
    ahead)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed, tightly coverable pot of sufficient size 
    (5 quarts for a whole recipe, 2-1/2 quarts for a half recipe) 
    place a layer of <b>Potato Slices</b>, just enough to cover the 
    bottom, then arrange the <b>Fish</b> over them.</li>
  <li>Mix the rest of the <b>Potatoes</b> into the <b>Tomato mix</b> 
    along with <b>Lemon Peel</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>. Spread this 
    mixture over the Fish.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Stock</b>, <b>Wine</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Pour this mixture over the top.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Cilantro mix</b> evenly over everything, then drizzle 
    on the <b>Olive Oil</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 minutes)
  <ol start="11"> 
  <li>Bring to a boil. Immediately turn down the heat, cover tightly and 
    simmer slowly until the Potatoes are done, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning. Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b> and take off the heat 
    (see <a href="aof_fshcongr1.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Thai Jasmine Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish pieces without heads, bones 
  or scales. The correct fish is Congrio, the Pink Cusk-eel, (Congrio 
  dorado; <i>Genypterus blacodes</i>) which lives deep in the Southern 
  Hemisphere. It is not available in North America. Some recipes 
  say "Conger Eel", but this is in error, as there are no commercial 
  conger eels off the coast of Chile. Use a light colored ocean fish 
  that holds together well with wet cooking. 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_emperpz.html"><b>Pink Ear Emperor</b></a> or 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_monkz.html"><b>Monkfish</b></a> should be 
  good, or my favorite all purpose fish, 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html"><b>Golden Pompano</b></a>. The 
  photo example was made with Japanese Amberjack (Hamachi), which is a 
  little darker. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_eelcuskz.html"><b>Cusk-eels</b></a> page and our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very big page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are presumed to be 
  very small - the pattern recipe calls for "new potatoes". Real new 
  potatoes are all but impossible to find in North America. If you use 
  larger  potatoes, cut the slices into halves or quarters. In Chile they 
  have hundreds of varieties of potato, but here in North America White 
  Rose or Red Potatoes are good for this recipe. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type 
  potatoes which become mush if cooked a little long (and they definitely 
  don't use those in Chile). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; It is up to the discretion of the cook if 
  these are used or not. I consider them important, some do not.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I start with  whole fish and make stock 
  from the heads, bones and fins, usually days ahead and freeze the 
  fillets until needed. If you don't have fish stock  you can substitute 
  Clam Juice and Water in equal amounts.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lemon Juice:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for sprinkling 
  the lemon juice over the fish after it is layered in the pan. The acid 
  in the lemon juice will harden the outside surface of the potatoes 
  (the tomatoes already harden them some), so I stir it in at the end of 
  cooking. This is also better for the lemon flavor.</li>
