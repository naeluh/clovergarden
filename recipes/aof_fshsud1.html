<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish fillets. The fish preferred in 
  the region would be the Corvina Drum, but that fish is available only along 
  the Pacific coast of South America. Other Drums and Croakers (family 
  <i>Sciaenidae</i> - often called "Sea Bass") are available worldwide, but 
  they are mostly too tender for wet cooking. Red Drum and King Weakfish are 
  good. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_croakz.html"><b>Croakers 
  &amp; Drums</b></a> page. Suitable Croakers weren't available at the time, 
  so the photo example was made with Golden Pompano (my favorite), which I 
  always use skin-on.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Aji Amarillo Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very important item in Peruvian 
  cuisines. It is available from some Latin markets (Vallarta here in 
  Southern California) and can be ordered on-line. It can be made from whole 
  Amarillo Chilis, but those are far harder to find in North America than 
  Paste in a jar. The 2 Tablespoons called for will give very light chili 
  heat.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; For most Fish recipes or this sort, I start 
  with  whole fish and make stock from the heads, bones and fins, usually 
  days ahead and freeze the fillets until needed. Golden Pompano makes an 
  excellent stock. See our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">
  <b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Made as given here, this is a soup. I serve it 
  with a bowl of Steamed Rice on the table, which can be spooned into the soup 
  in the amount desired.  If you want more of a stew, just use 2 cups of fish 
  stock instead of 3. If serving on a buffet, it is best to add the Fish after 
  reheating and ready to pour into a slow cooker set to Keep Warm (150&deg; 
  to 155&deg;F (66&deg; to 69&deg;C))</li>
