Seafood in a Paila (clay pot). Most photos show it piled high with in-the-shell 
clams and mussels, a great show, but impractical and expensive. See

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; My favorite fish for recipes like this is Golden 
  Pompano. It's a tasty fish, holds together well in soups and stews, can be 
  used skin-on, is easy to fillet, and produces a very good fish broth or 
  stock. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html"><b>Golden 
  Pompano</b></a> page, or our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties 
  of Fish</b></a> (very big page) for other fish. If you are new to dealing 
  with whole fish, see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning & 
  Filleting Round Bodied Fish</b></a>. For the Pompano I leave the skin on, 
  but most fish need to be skinned.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp; This is most easily procured as frozen Squid Rings, 
  but other forms can be used as well. The photo example used a fancier cut 
  purchased from a large Asian market. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/seasquid.html"><b>Squid</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are not usually included, but here I take 
  the suggestion from an authentic Chilean. White Rose or similar work well. 
  Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush if cooked a little 
  more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Broth:</h3> &nbsp; I start with  whole fish and make stock 
  from the heads, bones and fins, usually days ahead and freeze the 
  fillets until needed. The broth can be made even weeks ahead if 
  properly stored - see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
  Stock</b></a> page. If you don't have fish stock  you can substitute 
  Clam Juice and Water in equal amounts. Some people suggest Vegetable 
  Broth, which will also work. There are enough seafood items in the dish 
  to give it a seafood flavor. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, the real ingredients are 
  whatever seafood you can get that day. Variations are not just acceptable, 
  but normal, so if you can't get some items, substitute with other seafood. 
  I buy all the seafood from a large Asian market in Los Angeles (San 
  Gabriel). This recipe can be made even a day ahead, up to adding the 
  Fish. The final steps should be made close to serving time. For buffet 
  service, once the Shellfish mix is cooked, I pour into a slow cooker set 
  to "Keep Warm". The Parsley, I just stir in. If you have to reheat a 
  completed soup, take it up to only 165&deg;F/75&deg;C. That's hot enough 
  to kill any bacteria, but not overcook the seafood.</li>
