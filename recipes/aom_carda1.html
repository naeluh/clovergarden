This is the hangover cure soup of Bolivia. Unlike most other such soups, 
it is based not on Calf Feet and Tripe, but on Calf Feet and 
Bull Penis. It's not often made at home.  See also <a href="aom_carda1.html#11">

There are hundreds of bistros in Bolivia specializing in this soup, 
which is thought to be an aphrodisiac as well as a hangover cure. It's 
a bit of a project, but you can spread it out over a couple of days.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash the <b>PIZZLE</b> and <b>FOOT</b>. Place them in a pot with 
    water to cover well. Bring to a boil for a couple of minutes. Pour 
    out into a clean sink. Wash the pot and rinse the meats well. 
    Return to the pot with water to cover and return to a boil.</li>
  <li>When boiling, transfer the <b>Pizzle</b> and <b>Foot</b> to a 
    slow cooker, and pour in the liquid. Set to High. When it starts 
    to bubble, set it to Low and let it cook for 10 hours until the 
    Pizzle is tender enough to eat. See also 
    <a href="aom_carda1.html#08"><b>Cooking Times</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Fish <b>Pizzle</b> out of the Liquid and cut into serving pieces, 
    not much more than 1 inch long or they'll be difficult to handle. 
    Cut Calf Foot tendons (if you have removed them at 4 hours) and mix 
    in. Set aside.</li>    
  <li>Strain the liquid, discarding all bones and mushy solids. Let 
    settle - then defat using your gravy separator. Hold <b>Pizzle 
    Broth</b> until ready to cook meat.</li>
  <li>Boil <b>EGGS</b>, peel and cool.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Cook Meats</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 2 inch cubes. Remove excess fat from 
    <b>LAMB</b>. Place them in a pot with  water to cover well. Bring 
    to a boil for a few minutes. Pour out into a clean sink. Wash 
    the pot and rinse the meats well.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Meats</b> to the pot. Pour in <b>Pizzle Broth</b> and 
    add cold <b>Water</b> to cover. Return to a boil and simmer until 
    meats are tender (1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hrs).</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Meats</b> and strip from any bones that were 
    included.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Broth</b> and let settle - then defat using your 
    gravy separator.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Vegies</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and <b>TURNIP</b>. Cut both into about 1 
    inch cubes, or as desired. Hold both in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice medium crosswise. Cut 
    <b>CARROTS</b> into 1 inch lengths and <b>CELERY</b>into 1/2 inch 
    lengths. Mix all.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef "Pizzle":</h3> &nbsp; You won't be finding 
  this in your local supermarket, but most larger Chinese or Southeast 
  Asian markets (except Philippine) will have it in the frozen food 
  cases. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_pizzlz.html">Beef "Pizzle"</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Calf Foot:</h3> &nbsp; This ingredient is 
  included in most hangover cure soups (and in Armenia is often the 
  only ingredient). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_footz.html">Calf Feet</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Beef</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless. If you 
  use cuts with bones, compensate the weight. Some recipes call for two 
  cuts, usually <i>Tapa de Cuadril</i> (Round) and <i>Pecho</i> (Breast), 
  and some just call for <i>Pecho</i>. The nearest North American cut 
  is Brisket. Use whatever cuts you want.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lamb or Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; about half the 
  cooks use Lamb, and the other half toss in a whole Chicken (for this 
  recipe that would be a half Chicken). Personally, I use Mutton or 
  Goat, which I can get in convenient chunks at a lower price. They're 
  bony so I use about 1-3/4 pounds. In Bolivia they may use Llama.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White rose or similar 
  waxy potatoes work well. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes as they 
  disintegrate into mush if cooked a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Mostly Long Grain white rice 
  is used in South America. Thai Jasmine will work fine.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Llajwa:</h3> &nbsp; This is the salsa / hot 
  sauce of Bolivia. It's delicious and very easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="ajv_llajwa1.html"><b>Llajwa / Bolivian Salsa</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Cooking Times:</h3> &nbsp; Pizzle is not meat, it is all tough 
  vascular tissue which takes very long cooking. I prefer to pull the 
  Calf Foot at about 4 hours and pull out the tendons while they are 
  still fairly firm, returning them to the pot when the Pizzle is done. 
  The rest goes back into the pot immediately.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Bolivia, this soup is 
  made in vast quantity, usually in several 40 quart pots. Broth is 
  ladled into large wide bowls. Large chunks of the various meats are 
  placed in the bowls, and they are sent out to the tables. The meats 
  may or may not include bones. I have no intention of making that 
  much, and I don't serve quite that way, so I cut my meats relatively 
  small. I omitted the Egg in the photo because pure white things tend 
  to mess up a photo.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Variations</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for 
  1/2 pound Salt Dried Beef (Charque). Some call for Tunta (freeze 
  dried potatoes (Chu&ntilde;o)) as well as fresh potatoes.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; In Bolivia this soup has 
  a strong reputation as an effetive aphrodisiac, "Bolivian Viagra". 
  I did not notice any such effect, and nor have American tourists in 
  Bolivia who have tried it. Bolivian medical authorities say it is 
  strictly a placebo effect - you have to believe in it for it to work. 
  The Pizzle is like little sausages in the soup, fairly firm but 
  gelatinous, and with little flavor of their own. Caldo de 
  Card&aacute;n is, in effect, a fairly light and pleasant beef soup, 
  but of strong curiosity value - and a good soup for Halloween parties.
