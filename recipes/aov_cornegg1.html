This recipe is based closely on one attributed to the cloistered convent 
of Santa Clara, just outside Cusco, Peru. The recipe is thought to date 
from the 16th century and is still in use today.

  <p>This soup can credit its longevity to being delicious, simple and 
  easy to make. I have served it as a buffet party dish. It worked well 
  and was well liked.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Strip kernels from <b>CORN</b>, discarding the cobs.</li>
  <li>Chop the <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Seed <b>CHILI</b> and chop 
    very fine.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>QUESO</b> very small (it does not melt).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed saucepan holding at least 2 quarts, heat 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion</b> stirring until it 
    has turned a very light golden, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> 
    for just a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Add 6 cups <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in the 
    <b>Corn</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Queso Fresco</b>. Simmer for about 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>With the soup at a simmer, break each egg into a small bowl or 
    ladle, being careful not to break the yolk. Lower each one into 
    the soup. Cover and let them poach for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve in bowls, with one egg per serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili Aji:</h3> &nbsp; The proper chili in Chile is the yellow 
  Aji Amarillo. Those are still nearly impossible to get fresh in North 
  America, even here in Los Angeles. Aji Amarillo paste is quite easy to 
  find in Latino markets, whole Aji Amarillo in cans and jars can also be 
  found, and a few markets have bags of them frozen. Any of these 
  products will work in this recipe. If you don't have any of these, 
  some suggest an orange Habanero - similar flavor but waaaay hotter. 
  The quantity given here makes for a very mild soup and I use more, 
  but use your own best judgement. for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_ajiyz.html"><b>Aji Amarillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Queso Fresco:</h3> &nbsp; This is a soft white cheese available 
  in disk shaped packages in any market serving a Mexican, Central or 
  South America community.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; I use "medium" size chicken eggs, which are the 
  smallest you can get around here.</li>
