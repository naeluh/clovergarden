<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Queso Panela:</h3> &nbsp; The correct cheese for this recipe is Queso 
  Paraguay (kes&uacute; Paraguai), which is imperfectly available in North 
  America. Queso Panela is a popular Mexican type cheese, available from 
  markets serving a Mexican community. It is a non-melting cheese, and 
  works very well, but could be substituted by other cheeses, including 
  Queso Fresco and Monterey Jack. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html#mex"><b>Varieties of Cheese</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cornmeal:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a finely ground yellow cornmeal. 
  The pattern recipe favors Quaker brand, but I used Albers because that's 
  what the markets carry around here. 14 ounces is 400 grams or 2-1/4 cups.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Butter</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Lard is used, but butter may be 
  more acceptable to North Americans, even though Lard has a better health 
  profile. If you use Lard, render it yourself. Shelf stable supermarket 
  Lard is made by hydrogenation and bleaching.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Do Ahead</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be made at least 4 days ahead 
  and kept refrigerated, wrapped in plastic wrap. Reheat in a
  350&deg;F/175&deg;C Oven until warm. Don't overheat or it will get stiff.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>History</h3> &nbsp; Unlike the cuisines of neighboring Argentina 
  and Uruguay which are purely European, just incorporating a few native 
  ingredients, the native Guaran&iacute; people have had considerable 
  influence on the cuisine of Paraguay. In particular, they used a lot of 
  corn (maize), corn meal, and Cassava in their recipes. The story of the 
  name is that Don Carlos Antonio Lopez, president of Paraguay, was looking 
  forward to his favorite "white soup" (Sopa). The cook accidentally 
  put in much too much corn meal. Without time to start over, she put it 
  in a pan and shoved it in the oven. President Lopez liked it so much 
  he immediately named it "Sopa Paraguaya". This story conflicts with  
  evidence the Guaran&iacute; people had been making similar, though simpler, 
  corn breads long before President Lopez's time.</li>
