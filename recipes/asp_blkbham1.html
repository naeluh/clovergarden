Intensely flavorful, but with very mild chili heat, this is an outstanding 
bean dish. In Peru it is eaten with rice, which is the way I eat it, but 
others use it as a side dish for roasted meats and the like.

  <p>This recipe also works well with pork. Vegetarians can skip the 
  meat without loosing too much.</p>

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 hrs - 10 min work))
  <ol>
  <li>Soak dried <b>BLACK BEANS</b> 8 hrs in 2 cups <b>Water</b> with 
    1/2 T <b>Salt</b> (yes, salt).</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Beans</b> and rinse. Simmer in <b>Water</b> to cover 
    until tender but not mushy, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li><u>IF Using</u>: &nbsp; Hard cook <b>Egg</b> for garnish. See 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> for best 
    method.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - (25 min work))
  <ol start=4>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in quarters lengthwise, then slice crosswise 
     1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Onions</b> in a saucepan with 1 t <b>Salt</b> and 
   <b>Water</b> to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then 
   immediately drain. Put them in a small bowl and mix with the 
   <b>Vinegar</b>.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>HAM</b> quite small, about 1/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Add to <b>Ham</b>.</li>
  <li>Grind together all <b>Spices items</b> in a spice grinder</li>
  <li>Chop hard boiled <b>EGG</b> coarse and pit <b>OLIVES</b> for 
    garnish (if used).
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Spices mix</b> for just 30 seconds, then stir in <b>Ham mix</b>.
    Fry stirring over moderate heat for 2 to 3 minutes, makings sure 
    the spices don't burn.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beans</b> and <b>Onions</b> (along with the 
    <b>Vinegar</b>) and 2 T <b>Water</b> until well blended. Cover and 
    simmer a couple minutes until it's all heated, stirring a couple 
    of times.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with steamed long grain Rice, or as desired. This 
    dish is usually garnished with hard cooked eggs, but that garnish 
    doesn't photograph well, so I garnished with parsley.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is best made from dried black 
  beans soaked 8 hours, but if you don't have the time you can use a 
  "quick brine" (for details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html">
  <b>Soaking / Brining Dried Beans</b></a> page. You could also use a 
  good grade of canned beans. Goya's "Premium" black beans seem pretty 
  good - you'll need 1-1/2 14 ounce cans. Rinse them before using in 
  the recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Annatto Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; These brick red seeds are available in 
  well stocked spice sections, particularly in markets serving Mexican, 
  Central and South American, Caribbean and Philippine communities. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_annattz.html"><b>Annatto</b></a> 
  page.</li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Ancho Chili:</h3> This is the dried form of the Poblano chili, 
  and is nearly black. It is sweet and flavorful but very low in chili 
  heat. It can be found in any spice section selling Mexican chilis. 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These would properly be large purple Alphonso 
  olives which are grown in Peru. These are fairly available in better 
  deli departments, but if you can't get them you can use large Greek 
  Kalamata olives. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
