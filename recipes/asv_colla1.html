Collard Greens prepared this way are an almost essential side dish in 
Brazil, and made similarly in Portugal. Their mild bitterness especially 
complements roasted meats and other rich dishes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice the central stems from the <b>COLLARDS</b>. Roll up the leaf 
    halves as tight as you can from end to end, then slice the rolls 
    crosswise as thin as you can. You can stack a few leaf halves to 
    make this quicker.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> desired, you can take a few of the largest stems, peel 
    them to remove fibers, and cut them into about 3/16th inch lengths. 
    Add to the shreds to provide a different texture. </li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min) 
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> 
    until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>COLLARDS</b> until evenly covered with Oil. Season 
    with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and turn  down 
    to a simmer. Simmer gently until tender, about 30 minutes for 
    North American Collards, 10 minutes for Brazilian, Portuguese, and 
    African Collards (see <a href="asv_colla1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Drain any excess liquid and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Collard Greens:</h3> &nbsp; The Collards of the American South, 
  available in most markets in North America, came from Scotland, where 
  a leafy green has to be really tough to survive. The Collards of Brazil, 
  Portugal, and Africa are very similar to Kale, and cook far more 
   quickly. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_collaz.html">
   <b>Collard Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I have added more water than in the pattern 
  recipe, to compensate for longer cooking of North American Collards. 
  If you use Kale or Brazilian Collards, reduce by 1/4 cup. It is not 
  unheard of to fry the onions with diced Bacon.</li>
