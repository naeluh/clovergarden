<h1>Completo - Chilean Hot Dog</h1>
<br><img src="img/awm_complc09e.jpg" alt="Completed Completo Sandwich" class=mrg>

<p>Chile is a land where s&aacute;ndwiches star, and the Completo is one of the 
brightest of the stars. It is made by many formulas and variations, Here we 
concentrate on the standard Completo (Completo-Completo), though the 
Italiano is said to be the most popular. 

<p>These are quite a handful to handle, so I usually cut them in half.</p>

<h2 class=h1>Assembly</h2> - (15 min - once dogs are cooked)
<p></p>

<h2>Salchicha (Hot Dog)</h2>
<br><img src="img/awm_compld2f.jpg" alt="Salchicas (Hot Dogs)" class=mrg>
In Chile, the Dogs are a little larger around and quite a bit longer than 
those common in North America. They usually project just a little from both 
ends of the bun. "Bun Length" (5-1/2 inches) is the absolute minimum length. 
Fortunately, here in Los Angeles, I was able to find these 7 inch Russian 
style Dogs from New York.

<p>Pork Dogs are preferred, but if you religion forbids, you can use Beef 
Dogs.  The Dogs are usually boiled for about 10 minutes, but you can cook 
them by any means you prefer. They should be hot when tucked into the bun.
<br class=cll></p>

<br>
<h2>Bread</h2>
<br><img src="img/awm_complb2f.jpg" alt="French Roll" class=mrg>
Completos are considerably larger than American Hot Dogs, so in Chile there 
are special breads just for them (pan de completo). Our Hot Dog Buns just 
can't withstand the amount of toppings used. I use moderate size French Rolls 
that are soft with thin crust. If you have "Bun Length" Dogs, look for shorter 
rolls. Unacceptable are dense "artisan breads" with thick crusts and strongly 
flavored grains.

<p>Your buns should be very fresh. Even one day old they start to break up 
under the stress of sausages and toppings.</p>

<p>Unlike a Vietnamese <a href="swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Me</b></a> 
sandwich, which is cut from one side, these should be cut straight down from 
the top to 1/4 inch from the bottom. Like a Banh Me, you can remove some of 
the crumb from both sides near the bottom to make room for the salchicha 
(hot dog). This will help prevent the bun from splitting.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>First Filling</h2>
<br><img src="img/awm_complc02f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Sausage, Sauerkraut" class=mrg>
First the <b>Bun</b> is cut down from the top to 1/4 inch of the bottom. 
I find a thin, razor sharp Santoku vegetable slicing knife works far better 
on bread than serrated bread knives. Some crumb can be removed from 
both sides near the bottom to make room for the Dog.
<p>Next, the <b>Dog</b> is dropped into the Bun. Make sure it is not too wet as 
that would cause the bun to split in half.</p>
<p>Spread a little <b>Sauerkraut</b> along both sides of the Dog. Yes, 
Sauerkraut is a popular Chilean ingredient. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Second Filling</h2>
<br><img src="img/awm_complc05f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Salsa, Avocado" class=mrg>
<p>Drain the <b>Salsa</b>, and spread it across the Dog for the full length 
of the Bun. At this point some Hot Sauce can be applied if desired.
<p> now spread the <b>Avocado Paste</b> over the Salsa for the full length 
of the Bun.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Final Topping</h2>
<br><img src="img/awm_complc11f.jpg" alt="Finished Completo" class=mrg>
Now apply a wavy line of <b>Mayonnaise</b> over the Avocado layer. As mentioned. 
if, for some reason, you reject Mayonnaise, you can apply a thin stream of 
Ketchup and a thin stream of Mustard criss crossing the Avocado layer, and 
each other.

<p>Serve the Completo immediately.
