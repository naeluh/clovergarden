<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Yerba Mate:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is leaves harvested from a shrub, 
  that in the wild can grow into a tree over 40 feet high. It is widely 
  available in North America, on-line and from multi-ethnic markets. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/il_yerbmatz.html"><b>Yerba Mate</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Background:</h3> &nbsp; This beverage was adopted from Guaran&iacute; 
  and Tup&iacute; peoples of Paraguay, who had been drinking it from 
  pre-Columbian times. The name Mat&eacute; (Spanish "Mate") is both the 
  gourd from which it is traditionally consumed, and the beverage itself. 
  It is drunk from the gourd (or today often from a special cup) using a straw 
  called a <i>bombilla</i>, usually of metal with a strainer at the bottom 
  end. This strainer is not needed for the recipe above, but definitely is 
  for Mate made the traditional way.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Traditional:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, serving Mate is the 
  South American equivalent of a Japanese Tea Ceremony. It requires an 
  experienced Cebador and well trained guests. This is not very practical 
  in North America, as anyone who has tried to organize buffet guests to 
  do something the "right way" will assure you. If you do want the 
  traditional method, you will find it in great detail on this

  <b>Mate (drink)</b></a> Wikipedia page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some include with their Mat&eacute; Mint, 
  Ginger, or other herbs. Yerba Mate is also brewed in cold ice water to 
  produce the beverage Terer&eacute;.</li>
