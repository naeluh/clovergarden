<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rica Rica:</h3> &nbsp; This is an herb unique to the deserts of Chile, 
  <i>Acantholippia deserticola</i>, of the Verbina family. It is usually sold 
  dried in a finely granular form. The flavor is similar to a mix of dried 
  mint and dried rosemary. It is available on-line in North America. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/lm_lamiales.html#rica"><b>Lamiales</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pisco:</h3> &nbsp; This is a grape brandy made in both Peru and Chile, 
  but by slightly different methods and from different grapes. I may be 
  untinted, but it can have a light golden tint if aged in wood. Chile 
  produces three times as much Pisco as Peru, but is also the largest 
  importer of Peruvian Pisco, taking 34% of Peruvian production. Pisco has 
  long been popular in North America, especially California, and can be found 
  on-line. It is usually about 80 proof (40% alcohol), but this cocktail will 
  come out at about 26 proof.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Simple Syrup</h3> &nbsp; This is just Sugar dissolved in Water (equal 
  amounts by measure). See our recipe (if you can call it that) 
  <a href="giv_smpsyr1.html"><b>Simple Syrup</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Egg White:</h3> &nbsp; This is used mainly in Peru, so much in Chile. 
  It makes a much more foamy cocktail, and the foam will last longer. The 
  usual precautions for using uncooked eggs should be observed.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations</h3> &nbsp; the Rica Rica Sour is strictly Chilaen, as that 
  herb only grows in the Chilean deserts. Using egg whites is mainly Peruvian. 
  Lime Juice is preferred, though lemon juice is also used. In Chile, a 
  specific very sour lime is preferred, but it's range is very small and it 
  is not available in North America.
