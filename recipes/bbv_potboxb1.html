Boxty is one of the great standards of Irish cooking. Good for breakfast 
or as a side dish, there are pan, griddle, boiled and baked versions. See 
<a href="bbv_potboxb1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for methods.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>If you'll be baking the boxty, preheat the oven to 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. If you'll be boiling the boxty you'll need a 
    big pot of salted water ready and boiling.</li>
  <li>Boil the 1-1/2 pounds of <b>POTATOES</b> in their skins (you can 
    boil them in the same water). When done, fish them out, 
    peel and mash well (see <a href="bbv_potboxb1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>While those are boiling, peel the 2 pounds of <b>POTATOES</b> and 
    grate on the coarse side of your box grater (or equivalent). Squeeze 
    them out thoroughly using a ricer or twisting in a cloth. Catch the 
    water in a bowl and let the starch settle to the bottom while you 
    work. 
    When settled, pour off the water keeping the starch</li>
  <li>Mix the freshly <b>Mashed Potatoes</b> with the <b>Grated 
    Potatoes</b>,<b>Flour</b>, collected <b>Potato Starch</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Get your hands in there and massage it until the mix 
    is even.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you'll be baking, heavily butter a shallow baking dish 
    or pan and load the <b>Potato Mix</b> into it. Cover with foil 
    (buttered on the bottom side) and slide into the oven. Bake for 
    about 1 hour, you want just a faint trace of browing.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you'll be boiling, immediately, with wet hands, form 
    <b>Potato Mix</b> into 5 inch cakes about 2 to 2-1/2 inches thick. 
    Gently lower them into the boiling water and simmer until they rise 
    to the surface, then simmer another 5 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Cool <b>Potato Cakes</b> thoroughly. Refrigerate for a few hours 
    or overnight if possible.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Slice <b>Potato Cakes</b> about 3/8 inch thick. You'll probably 
    have to wash your slicing knife after each cut.</li>
  <li>In a well seasoned skillet heat <b>Oil</b> and fry slices of potato 
    cake until golden browned on both sides. Keep the oil about 1/8 inch 
    deep and exercise patience, they need to fry slowly, particularly if 
    using butter.</li>
  <li>Serve with butter or slices of fried bacon as desired, or with 
    just salt. They'd go great with sour cream, but that just wouldn't 
    be Irish, would it?  Do keep in mind, this is dense caloric food 
    for field and mill workers.</li>
  <li>Once fried, boxty can be reheated in the oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The Irish use only russets, 
  and I wouldn't consider any other for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page. To peel 
  hot russets just fish them out onto your cutting board and rake the 
  skin off with the tines of a fork.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally these would be fried, in butter or 
  bacon fat, but Olive Pomace or Avocodo oils will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potato Ricer:</h3> &nbsp; A potato ricer is a particularly 
  good tool for recipes like this. First you use it as a press to squeeze 
  the grated potatoes dry. Second you press the boiled potatoes through 
  it right into the bowl with the grated potatoes. See 
  <a href="bbv_potboxb1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The Irish traditionally boiled their 
  boxty because they didn't have ovens. Baking is a much more reliable 
  method, and particularly good for doing most of the work well ahead.
  Boiled boxty is simple but time critical. The salt will cause the 
  batter mix to become too liquid in only a few minutes so you have to 
  form the cakes and get them into the boiling watter quickly. You have 
  to simmer long enough to cook through, but if you simmer too long 
  they'll fall into a pile of mush. Baked you just have to make sure 
  the baking dish is well buttered and you bake only until you have a 
  faint touch of browining (more and you'll have a hard crust when 
  fried). After thorough cooling the cake should just pop right out of 
  the pan. See <a href="bbv_potboxb1x.html#gal"><b>Photo 
  Gallery</b></a> for more detail.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tradition:</h3> &nbsp; Boxty has a long standing in Ireland, to 
  the point of having a special song. Actually it sounds to me like a 
  great refrain for a bawdy marching song for the Canadian Mounties 
  (who "always get their man").
  <blockquote>Boxty on the griddle
  <br>Boxty in the pan
  <br>If you can't make boxty
  <br>You'll never get your man</blockquote>
