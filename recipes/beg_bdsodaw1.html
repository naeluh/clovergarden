  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F/230&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Measure <b>Flour</b> and evenly mix in <b>Baking Soda</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Sift into a mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Make a well in the center of the bowl of flour. Pour in most of the 
    <b>Buttermilk</b>. Get your hands in there and mix, using a little 
    more buttermilk as needed until you have a dough that's quite soft but 
    not sticky.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands and dry them. Then with floured hands put the dough 
    out on a floured board and knead it just a couple strokes to organize 
    it. Form it into a round loaf about 1-1/2 inches thick Cut a cross 
    across it about 3/8 inch deep with the cut going around the edge to 
    the board.</li>
  <li>Set immediately on a floured baking pan, slide into the 
    450&deg;F oven and bake 15 minutes, then turn the oven down to 
    400&deg;F/200&deg;C  for 20 to 30 minutes until done (the loaf will 
    sound hollow when tapped on the bottom).</li>
  <li>Cool on a wire rack.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Use unbleached All Purpose flour for white 
  flour.  Do not use bread flour, all purpose flour approximates the 
  soft wheat flour traditionally available in Ireland. This bread can 
  also be made with all white flour, but I find the given version 
  tastes better. Measure flour by spooning it into a 1 cup dry measure, 
  then shave it flush with the top edge.</li>  
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tradition:</h3> &nbsp; The earliest use of soda ash to raise bread 
  is thought to have been by American Indians. Refined sodium bicarbonate 
  was commonly used in North America by the early 1800s. The earliest 
  recorded mention of soda bread in Ireland is from 1837 but it didn't 
  became widely popular there until the 1850s, after the potato famine. 
  It gained popularity because it was quick and worked well with the soft 
  wheat flour then available in Ireland.
  <br>The preferred acids to react with the soda were sour milk and 
  dilute hydrochloric acid, but today buttermilk and cream of tartar are 
  used. The Irish had no ovens so this bread was most often baked under 
  an inveted cauldron or in a heavy pot or pan, preferably with a rimmed 
  lid so plenty of hot coals could be piled on top. See 
  <a href="beg_bdsodaw1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> for an 
  example that's still available in North America.</li>
