It's from the same Indian origin as the famous Country Captain 
of the American Southeast. I pieced it together from scanty references, 
but "authenticity" is not compromised - there is no 
standard recipe.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1-1/2 inch chunks <u>Note</u>: you 
    can do the deep fry (35 min) a day ahead and refrigerate.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut into fine threads.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHILIS</b> in half lengthwise and core. Slice crosswise into 
    narrow strips..</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Spice mix</b> items.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr, depending)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">kadhai</a>, wok or deep heavy 
    pan, heat enough <b>Oil</b> for deep fry to about 
    395&deg;F/200&deg;C. Fry <b>Chicken</b> in small batches until just 
    lightly browned. Small batches won't take much longer and the chicken 
    will brown before it dries out. Drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Fry 
    <b>Ginger</b> until aromatic, then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry 
    stirring until onions are evenly golden brown. When onions start 
    to show color, stir in <b>Garlic</b> so it will be well browned.</li>
  <li> Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Spice mix</b> until well distributed, 
    then stir in <b>Stock</b>.  Bring to boil, cover, and simmer 30 to 
    45 minutes or until chicken is tender. Adjust liquid as needed, by 
    simmering uncovered or adding boiling water.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili</b> for about 2 minute, then stir in <b>Lemon 
    Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for skinless, 
  boneless and trimmed of fat. You can use bone-in joints, with legs and 
  thighs cut in pieces (use a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft 
  faced mallet) You will need about 3 pounds. They must be skinless as 
  skin and fat are not used in India. I use leg and thigh meat for better 
  flavor and texture than the cardboard breasts we get around here. I buy 
  whole thighs and make the needed stock from the bones and skins.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable, high temperature 
  oil. I always use Olive Pomace, but Peanut or Rice Bran oils will work 
  (less durable). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Fresnos, but 
  Holland Red or similar medium hot chilis will do fine. 
  Use 2 if you like hotter. Green chilis can also be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Madras Curry Powder, an 
  Anglo-Indian invention from the Raj. Use a good brand (Sun or Ship) 
  available in cans in markets. Of course it's better made fresh per 
  our recipe: <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cayenne:</h3> &nbsp; Actually, I use India extra 
  hot, but it's about the same. 1/8 t gives the recipe a mild but 
  noticeable bite - use your own best judgement.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Historical Notes:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is probably named for 
  captains of India based ships called "country ships" during the Raj, 
  thus "Country Captain". It could also be named after an Indian native 
  serving as a captain in the British army, also a "Country Captain", 
  but its prominence in American and English seaports suggests the 
  nautical origin. Anglo-Indian Country Captain (as made in India) 
  differs in being a rather dry curry, but it's still fried 
  chicken with curry spices and onions. In England it is made with stock 
  and soured with lemon or lime, while in the American south it is made 
  using tomatoes. In keeping with Indian practice, the chicken is skinless 
  and the dish is served with steamed long grain rice. Rice for the 
  English version was probably originally Carolina Rice (Patna type), 
  once a major export from America to England, but exports did not 
  recover from  the Civil War. There's nothing to stop us from serving 
  it with superior Thai Jasmine rice, though Carolina type rice is now 
  again available from a boutique grower in the Carolinas, slightly 
  improved, under the name "Carolina Gold Rice.</li>
