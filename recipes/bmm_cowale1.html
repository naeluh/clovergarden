A very beefy stew with plenty of sauce, sure to please carnivores. It is 
quite intense, so usually served with plenty of 
<a href="bsn_dumpcc1.html"><b>Cheddar Cheese Dumplings</b></a>, though 
smashed potatoes would work well too.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into cubes about 1-1/2 inch 
    on a side.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Tallow</b> in a heavy bottomed coverable pan (a 3-1/2 
    quart saut&eacute; pan works very well) and fry <b>Onions</b> over 
    moderate heat, stirring often until soft but not at all browned. 
    Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving as much fat as you can.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in another 1 T <b>Tallow</b>, then the <b>Beef</b>. Fry 
    tumbling over high heat until lightly browned on all sides. Sprinkle 
    on the <b>Flour</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat 1 minute 
    more.</li>  
  <li>Stir in <b>Ale</b>, <b>Sugar</b> and <b>Cinnamon</b>. Stir the 
    <b>Onions</b> back in, then <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Cover 
    and simmer over low heat, stirring now and then, until Beef is 
    tender (See <a href="bmm_cowale1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b>)</a>. This will be 1-1/4 to 
    1-3/4 hours depending on cut. If it is getting too dry, add some 
    water - resist the urge to add more ale as it will increase the 
    bitterness.</li>
  <li>Serve with <b>Cheddar Cheese Dumplings</b> (or smashed potatoes if 
    you can't manage the dumplings).</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with 
  excess fat removed. I prefer chuck for better flavor and faster 
  cooking, but round will do fine too.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Tallow:</h3> &nbsp; This is rendered beef 
  fat (the cow equivalent of lard). It is nowhere near as unhealthy as 
  the trans fats and polyunsaturated oils the AHA told you to use instead 
  - but if you really must, you can use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_suetz.html"><b>Suet / 
  Tallow</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Brown Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; As readers of this 
  site may have noticed, I avoid sugar wherever possible. In this case 
  it is not possible, as it is needed to counter the bitterness of the 
  ale (more obvious in cooking than in drinking).</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cheddar Cheese Dumplings:</h3> &nbsp; These are 
  traditional, and easy to make - see our recipe 
  <a href="bsn_dumpcc1.html"><b>Cheddar Cheese Dumplings</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp;  In England, this would be 
  done in the oven (they seem to do almost everything in the oven), but 
  in Sunny Southern California we don't fire up an oven unless we really 
  need to. The pattern recipe calls for placing the Onions in a casserole 
  after they are translucent, then placing the Beef and all other 
  ingredients over them. This goes covered into a 350&deg;F/180&deg;C 
  oven for 1/2 hour, then at 325&deg;F/125&deg;C for another 1-1/2 hours. 
  When the beef is tender, the dumplings would be placed on top, the 
  casserole returned to the oven, but uncovered, until the dumplings 
  rise (20 to 30 minutes).</li>
