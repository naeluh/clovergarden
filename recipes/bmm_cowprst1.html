A very popular pot roast in Merry Ol' England. The "overcooked" root 
vegetables, traditionally roasted in the pot with the beef, are as much a 
part of the sauce as items on their own - See <a href="bmm_cowprst1.html#02">

<p>This dish has been very popular at buffet parties.</p>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs - 1 hr work)
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 325&deg;F/160&deg;C.</li>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of any excess fat. Fry in <b>Oil</b> and 
  <b>Butter</b> until nicely browned on all sides, being careful not to 
  burn the butter. See <a href="bmm_cowprst1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for details. </li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> coarse. Crush <b>Garlic</b> with the side of your 
  prep knife.  Load them into your Dutch oven along with <b>Beef</b> and 
  all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil on the stove top, then cover the pot with aluminum foil 
  and fit the lid over it (the foil makes a good seal and is less messy 
  than "authentic" methods were). Slip it into the preheated oven and leave 
  it there for 3 hours for round, 2-3/4 hours for chuck.</li>
<li>Meanwhile cut <b>CARROTS</b> into largish chunks and do the same with 
  <b>TURNIP</b> and <b>PARSNIPS</b>. Mix.</li>   
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is done, remove it from the pot and let get cold (so 
  you can slice it). 
<li>Strain the liquid, discarding all solids and de-fat it using your 
  gravy separator. Clean the pot and add <b>Root Vegetables</b>, and more 
  <b>Wine</b> and <b>Water</b> as needed to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer 
  until the carrots are cooked all the way through. The Parsnips and Turnips 
  will be very soft.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is thoroughly cold you can slice it neatly with a razor 
  sharp slicing knife. Slice across the grain so it isn't stringy and 
  arrange on an oven-proof serving platter.</li>
<li>Strain the <b>Vegetables</b> from the sauce and arrange them with the 
  beef. You should have at least 1-1/2 cups of sauce. If not - more wine 
  and water.</li>
<li>In a small pan sufficient to hold the sauce, heat the <b>Butter</b> and 
  stir in the <b>Flour</b>. Fry stirring over moderate heat until the 
  flour is well incorporated and threatens to color. Then stir in, little by 
  little some <u>cold</u> water until you have a smooth paste. Then stir in, 
  starting with small amounts, the sauce, adding more when what you have is 
  smooth. Finally bring to a simmer and simmer stirring a few minutes until 
  sauce is thickened. It should not be too thick, it should pour smoothly - 
  adjust liquid if needed.</li>
<li>Reheat the meat and vegetables in the oven. Pour hot sauce over and 
  serve - see <a href="bmm_cowprst1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for alternative.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Topside or Silverside is generally 
  used (in North America this would be Top Round Roast) but I often use a 
  lean chuck roast (a little more tender). For comparison between English 
  and North American cuts see our <a href="../ingred/ab_cowcc.html">
  <b>Beef Charts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Root Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; A combination of half Carrots and the 
  rest Turnips and Parsnips works extremely well. Use fairly large 
  carrots. This recipe long predates the arrival of potatoes so they are 
  not used here. Traditionally, the roots are roasted in the pot with the 
  meat, but this recipe presumes there isn't room and cooks them in the 
  sauce after it is de-fatted. Note: by "Turnip" we mean "White Turnip" 
  - see our <a href="../ingred/cb_root.html#trans"><b>Turnip 
  Translation</b></a> page for regional meanings.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thickener:</h3> &nbsp; A flour / butter roux is the authentic 
  thickener. Today some people use a cornstarch / water slurry, which is 
  easier but produces a rather glossy sauce with a somewhat different 
  flavor - and it doesn't stand up as well to reheating.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Browning:</h3> &nbsp; This is traditionally done in the Dutch oven 
  the meat will be roasted in, but this can be difficult, depending on 
  the shape and size of the meat compared to the pot. It may be more 
  practical to brown in a large heavy pan. Pour the fat into the Dutch 
  oven and de-glaze the pan with the wine / water mix. I fry in an 
  Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a> which gives 
  me the best possible control. In any case, browning such a large 
  lump is dangerous (hot oil can splash if it slips when turning), so 
  needs to be done by a careful, sober adult with no children hanging 
  around. If your SO can meet that description it will free you to do 
  other tasks. All butter can be used - the oil will <u>not</u> keep 
  the butter from burning. A 3-1/2 pound lump of beef browns in about 
  20 minutes, a bit longer for larger lumps.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Since I serve this at buffet parties, I 
  arrange it in a shallow coverable electric pan, vegetables around the 
  edge and meat, sliced and cut into modest size pieces, in the center. 
  Pour in hot sauce and heat with the pan set at "low". When it 
  starts to bubble, turn it down to "warm" (about 165%deg;F/74&deg;C 
  is safe). Keep covered so it doesn't dry out.</li>
