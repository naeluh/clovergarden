An excellent party stew, sure to get comments. In Ireland, damaged bulls 
and elderly cows were eaten, nothing like our feed lot beef, so 
stewing was the way to go. See <a href="bmm_cowstew1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> 
for methods.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into cubes about 1-1/2 inch 
    on a side. </li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEKS</b> down to the white, yellow and light green. 
    (see <a href="bmm_cowstew1x.html#gallery"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>) 
    Slice thin crosswise from green end to root.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop small. Mix with Leeks.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1 inch lengths. Cut <b>CELERY</b> 
    into 1/4 inch slices.  Chop <b>Parsley</b> and <b>Marjoram</b> 
    small. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, then quench in 
    cold water. Peel, slice thick and cut slices into quarters.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (3-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a large heavy skillet heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> and fry half the beef 
    until browned on all sides. Add 1 T more <b>Oil</b> and do the other 
    half.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> in a heavy bottomed pot and fry <b>Leek mix</b> 
    over moderate heat, stirring often until soft but not at all browned.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b>, <b>Guinness</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. Add water 
    as needed to not quite cover the beef. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    covered for about 2 hours, or until beef is nearly tender, stirring 
    now and then.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrot mix</b> and <b>Tomatoes</b>. Season with 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, cover and simmer for about 
    30 minutes, or until beef is tender.</li>
  <li>Serve with potatoes and/or Irish soda bread.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with 
  excess fat removed. I prefer chuck for having a little fat running 
  through it but round will do fine.</li>
<li id="02"><b>Method:</b> &nbsp; Originally stews like this 
  would be made in a cauldron hanging over the hearth fire, low for the 
  browning then raised for the stewing. Or, after browning it could be 
  placed in hot coals with more coals over the lid. Suitable pots for 
  this method are still made (see <a href="bmm_cowstew1x.html#gallery">
  <b>Photo Gallery</b></a>). To imitate this method many recipes will 
  have you make it in a heavy Dutch oven, frying on the  stove top and 
  stewing in a 350&deg;F oven. I find it works just fine cooked in a 
  heavy bottomed pot over a very slow burner. If it's for a party I'll 
  pour it into a slow cooker to keep warm after it's done.  Of course 
  you could do all the stewing in the slow cooker but I haven't the 
  patience for those things. Also for parties I'll do the frying and 
  clean-up the night before and the stewing on party day.</li>
