Rather more elaborate than your typical American Mac &amp; Cheese. This

  <p>As a party dish, this is sure to be a stunning success - except 
  among the Vegetarians, Muslims and observant Jews - but they have 
  chosen to suffer of their own free will.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cook <b>CHICKEN</b> and <b>TONGUE</b> as needed (see notes).</li>
  <li>Make your <b>WHITE SAUCE</b> as set out in our recipe 
    <a href="gjd_whites1.html"><b>White Sauce - B&eacute;chamel 
    Sauce</b></a>  or similar.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>MACARONI</b> in plenty of salted boiling water until just 
    done. Don't overcook. If you have to hold at all, stir in a few drops 
    of Olive Oil to keep it from sticking together.</li>
  <li>With <b>White Sauce</b> just below a simmer, stir in <b>Cream</b>, 
    then stir into <b>Macaroni</b>.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Chicken</b> into about 1/2 inch dice, or tear into shreds if 
    desired. Dice <b>Tongue</b> and <b>Ham</b> very small. Shell 
    <b>SHRIMP</b>, de-vein as needed and cut into several pieces each. 
    Mix all.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEDDAR</b> on the large side of your grater.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>PARMESAN</b> fine.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> until 
    translucent but no browning. Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry gently 
    another 5 minutes or until very limp.</li> 
  <li>Grease a casserole of sufficient size to hold the entire recipe, which 
    will be 3 quarts. The photo specimen was made in a 13x9x2 inch baking 
    dish. Arrange 1/2 the <b>Chicken mix</b> on the bottom. Spread over it 
    1/2 the <b>Onion mix</b>, then 1/2 the <b>Pasta mix</b> and finally 
    1/2 the <b>Cheddar</b>. Repeat with the other half. Note: if your 3 quart 
    casserole is smaller but much deeper make it 3 layers.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Casserole</b> in a deep pan and fill the pan with water half 
    way up the sides of the casserole. Slip into the oven and bake for about 
    50 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pull from the oven. Sprinkle the top with <b>Parmesan</b> and dot with 
    <b>Butter</b>. Put back in the oven (without the water bath) for another 
    10 minutes, or however long it takes to get the amount of browning you 
    want.</li>
  <li>Serve hot (see <a href="bmm_macpie1.html#06">Note-6</a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>White Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very simple sauce made of 
  Butter, Flour and Milk. For method see our recipe 
  <a href="gjd_whites1.html"><b>White Sauce - B&eacute;chamel 
  Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Macaroni:</h3> &nbsp; Use a short, small diameter macaroni, which 
  may be curved or straight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for skinless 
  boneless chicken simmered until done through. Of course you could use 
  left-over roasted chicken too.  For cooking method see our 
  <a href="gmc_cluksimm1.html"><b>Simmered Chicken</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tongue:</h3> &nbsp; A beef tongue is <i>way</i> too big for this 
  recipe, so I use a pig tongue, which has better flavor and less fat 
  anyway. For details and cooking method see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_tonguez.html"><b>Pork Tongue</b></a> page. Of 
  course, if you have other uses for it, you could cook a beef tongue. 
  For method see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tonguez.html">
  <b>Beef / Veal Tongue</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cheddar Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Select a good quality aged cheddar - 
  cheap industrial cheddar turns to rubber rather than melting smoothly. 
  If in doubt, test.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Since I serve this at events 
  that may go on for hours, I place the casserole in a large coverable 
  electric skillet, with a little water in it. I keep the water hot but 
  just below a simmer.</li>
