The amounts given here may seem huge, but they are tiny compared to 
the original 18th century recipe - scaled to feed 40 or more. This 
recipe is a bit involved, so best to reserve it for large groups.

<p>The variety of ingredients and the nutmeg spicing harken back to 
Medieval times, but it would have had to be made with turnips instead of 
potatoes then. As with other traditional dishes, exact ingredients and 
proportions are flexible.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrsr)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of any excess fat and cut into slices 
  about 1/4 inch thick and about 1-1/4 inches square. Put the 
  <b>beef</b> in a pan with cold water to cover well and bring to a boil 
  for just a minute, then drain and rinse. This will improve the color 
  of the stew.</li>
<li>Trim <b>CHICKEN</b> meat as needed, and cut into chunks about 1-1/2 
  inches on a side.</li>
<li>If using, place <b>KIDNEYS</b>, cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Place in a 
  saucepan with salted water to cover well and bring to a boil for 1 
  minute. Strain and rinse. 6 ounces raw will yield 4 ounces.</li>
<li>If using, place <b>SWEETBREADS</b> in a saucepan with water to cover 
  and juice of 2 lemons (or 2 t Citric Acid). If using lemons, toss in 
  the peels too. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Drain and cool. 
  Cut into 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
<li>If using, place <b>TONGUE</b> into a pot with water to cover well. 
  Bring to a boil and simmer until done (1-1/4 hr for pig tongue 1 hour 
  per pound weight for beef) drain, cool and peel skin (if beef). Cut 
  into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Chop <b>BACON</b> small.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise, then slice medium crosswise. 
  Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into pieces about 1/2 inch on a side. Mix.
  </li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch cubes. Place in a 
  saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil and simmer until just 
  cooked through.</li>
<li>Slice <b>MUSHROOM</b> stems flush with the caps. Cut caps in half 
  if large, quarters if huge.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ARTICHOKE HEARTS</b> into squares about 1 inch on a side. 
  Fry in butter, tumbling for about 6 minutes. You will see some 
  browning.</li>
<li>Grind <b>NUTMEG</b> fine.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
<ol start="10">
<li>In an 8 quart heavy bottomed pot, spread the <b>Onion mix</b>. On 
  top spread the <b>Beef</b>, <b>Bacon</b>, <b>Kidneys</b>. and 
  . Add 2-1/2 t <b>Salt</b>, 1/2 t <b>Pepper</b>, the 
  <b>Nutmeg</b>, <b>Cloves</b>. <b>Lemon Juice</b> and <b>Thyme</b>. 
  Pour in enough water to just cover.  Bring to a boil, turn down the 
  heat and simmer slowly, covered for about 45 min.</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Chicken</b>,  <b>Sweetbreads</b>. pre-cooked 
  <b>Tongue</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b>. Add water only if needed to just 
  about cover (don't try to cover the floating mushrooms). Bring back 
  to a boil and simmer another 45 min or until the beef is tender. </li>
<li>Taste for salt and pepper. Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and bring back 
  to a boil. Stir in the <b>Peas</b>, and by time you can get it back 
  to a boil, it's done.</li>     
<li>Strain the liquid and set the solids aside. At this point I usually 
  transfer the solids to a slow cooker for serving. Most of them, anyway - 
  my biggest slow cooker is only 5 quarts.</li>
<li>De-fat the liquid (using your gravy separator). If you have too much 
  boil it down to the amount and consistency you want. You can thicken 
  the sauce with some blonde roux if you wish. The pattern recipe did 
  this, but served "family style" on a shallow platter with the 
  thickened sauce to be pored over. I serve buffet style out of a slow 
  cooker, so a more liquid sauce is better.</li>
<li>This dish reheats very well, but the peas quickly loose their bright 
  green color. If making ahead, reserve the Peas until you have 
  reheated.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing all 
  bones and excess fat. Any flavorful stewing cut will work.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless 
  and with excess fat removed. The pattern recipe called for a whole 
  2-1/2 pound chicken, cooked in a separate pot (with half the vegetables 
  and seasonings). When done, the skin was stripped off and bones removed 
  before final assembly. This seems overly complex, so I used the 
  convenient skinless,  boneless leg meat now common in our markets (since 
  the Russians aren't buying it up anymore) to make a 1 pot recipe. I 
  avoid the dry, cardboard flavored breast meat we get here in North 
  America. Of course the original 18th century recipe used a mix of game 
  birds instead of chicken, again harkening back to Medieval times, but 
  those are a bit scarce and costly around here.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is measured after 
  preparation as noted in the steps above, and should total about 1 pound, 
  in whatever proportion works for you. The writer of the pattern recipe 
  admitted she'd replaced the original Cocks Combs, Sweetbreads and Ox 
  Pallets (tongues) with just Lamb Kidneys (pork kidneys will work fine, 
  but beef kidneys have a much different flavor). Since my local market 
  had just put out fine looking trays of sweetbreads and pig tongues (less 
  fatty and more manageable than cow tongue), I used those and let the 
  kidney stand in for just the cock's combs. Cock's combs are not readily 
  available in Los Angeles - not even in the Asian markets. For details

  Tongue</b></a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;

  <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html"><b>Sweetbreads</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes are fine 
  for this use. Red potatoes will work too, but will thicken the sauce 
  more. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes which disintegrate into mush if 
  cooked just a bit long. The pattern recipe called for tiny New Potatoes 
  and left them whole, but those paper skinned potatoes are nearly 
  impossible to find in North America. The tiny "fingerling" potatoes 
  common in the yuppie outlets have tough skins, and I'm not real fond 
  of the flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Artichoke Hearts:</h3> &nbsp; These should be 
  water packed (just water, salt and citric acid) in a jar or can. 
  A 32 oz jar holding 6 large hearts yielded 12 oz drained weight.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern 
  recipe served this "family style", with the drained solids arranged 
  in a large shallow platter. The thickened sauce is for pouring over 
  (I don't know what she did with the rest, her platter certainly 
  wouldn't hold more than a couple of quarts - and I don't know how 
  much sauce she intended because the photo clearly had none). 
  <br>
  Since I serve this at buffet parties, I put the solids in a large 
  slow cooker (set to "keep warm"), defat the liquid and pour it over, 
  unthickened, until it doesn't quite cover the solids.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Green Dumplings</h3> &nbsp; Suet dumplings are 
  traditional with stews and potages in England. The ones specified by 
  the pattern recipe were made green by chopped parsley. They work 
  with "family style" service, but I consider them impractical for 
  uncontrolled buffet service and don't use them there. They are not 
  exactly "lean cuisine" in any case. The photo for the pattern recipe 
  included no dumplings (though it is possible they were in a covered 
  dish nearby). If you want them, here is our recipe:
