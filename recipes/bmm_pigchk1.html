This delicious braise is a fairly recent recipe, as English chefs work 
to re-establish England's pre-Victorian reputation for good food and 
fine dining.

<p>Traditionally, recipes of this sort would be left for hours in the 
ashes of the kitchen fire to cook slowly, but our kitchen stoves produce 
no ashes, so we use a slow cooker. A low oven could also be used.</p>

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Leave <b>PORK CHEEKS</b> whole, or cut into 2 or more pieces 
    as you prefer. I usually just cut off the thin side flap, which 
    blends in with the sauce. </li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 3/4 inch lengths. Cut  
    <b>CELERY</b> into 1/2 inch lengths. Chop <b>ONION</b> coarse. 
    Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and slice medium. Mix all</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Pork Cheeks</b>. Tumble often until lightly browned, taking 
    care the fond adhering to the pan is not burned. Remove, leaving 
    oil, and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Vegetable mix</b> into the pan and fry stirring until 
    Onions are translucent, taking care the fond doesn't burn.</li>
  <li>Transfer <b>Vegetable mix</b> into a slow cooker set to "High". 
    Embed the <b>Pork Cheeks</b>, <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b> 
    in the vegetables</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the <b>Flour</b> (thickener), salt and pepper over the 
    Cheeks.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Red Wine</b> into the pan. Bring it to a boil and scrape 
    up all the fond. Pour it over the contents of the Slow Cooker and 
    let come up to a strong simmer on High for about 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Turn down to "Low" and let cook for another 1-1/2 hours or until 
    the cheeks are fork tender. This stew should finish with a fairly 
    loose sauce.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Rice, Mashed Potatoes or bread to sop up the 
    sauce.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Cheeks:</h3> &nbsp;  This flavorful cut 
  won't likely to be found in a chain supermarket, but is often 
  available from the larger Asian markets here in Los Angeles, or 
  from a specialty meat market.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_cheekz.html"><b>Pork Cheeks</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Wine:</h3> &nbsp; A Pinot Noir, Petite 
  Sarah or similar will work fine.</li>
