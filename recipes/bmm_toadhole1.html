This dish is Yorkshire pudding with meat. Today it is properly made with 
sausages - either in a baking dish or individual servings made in a 
muffin pan. See <a href="bmm_toadhole1.html#05"><b>History</b></a>

<p>Some people call <a href="gbd_oneeyej1.html"><b>One Eyed Jack</b></a> 
"Toad in the Hole", which is wrong.</p>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C (no hotter).</li>
  <li>Whip together <b>Eggs</b>, <b>Milk</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Let stand for 10 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Slowly sift in the <b>Flour</b>, whipping continuously until you 
    have a batter in consistency similar to heavy cream. If there are any 
    lumps run it through a strainer.</li>
  <li>Leave the batter to rest for more than 30 minutes - up to several 
    hours.</li>
  <li>Pierce <b>SAUSAGES</b> all over and fry slowly in some <b>Fat</b> 
    until cooked through and nicely browned - or see <a href="bmm_toadhole1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Coat your baking pan/dish well with <b>Fat</b> and arrange 
    <b>Sausages</b> in it.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> your baking pan/dish is metal or ceramic, put it in the 
    oven until thoroughly hot. Bring it out and pour the <b>Batter</b> 
    over the sausages. Return immediately to the oven.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> your baking dish is Pyrex, better to just get it nice and 
    warm. Pyrex is tough, but cold batter in a very hot dish can shatter 
    it. Pour the <b>Batter</b> over the sausages and slide immediately 
    into the oven.</li>
  <li>Bake 20 minutes or until the batter has risen well and is nicely 
    browned. See <a href="bmm_toadhole1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for further details.
    </li>
  <li>Cut between each sausage, scoop out and serve immediately. 
    Traditionally toad in the hole is accompanied with plain brown or 
    onion gravy and a vegetable. Actually I rather enjoy it plain as a 
    cold snack, sliced across the sausages.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; A good quality, flavorful 
  sausage is needed - English, German bratwurst or mild Italian are all 
  fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fat:</h3> &nbsp; Rendered fats (drippings) from roasts 
  (beef, mutton or pork) or bacon are traditional. AHA campaigns have 
  caused people to shy away from these, but medical opinion has been 
  shifting back to natural fats and away from industrially refined 
  vegetable oils - but Pure Olive Oil (not virgin) is fine too, if you 
  prefer.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Roasting:</h3> &nbsp; If your pan is suitable, the 
  sausages can be roasted in the oven right in the pan. This works with 
  either a large single pan or with pieces of sausage in the cups of a 
  muffin pan for individual size toads (large cups, at least 3 inches 
  are best).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Most photos you'll see of toad in 
  hole the differ from mine, showing the sausages more exposed, spaced 
  farther apart and the pudding higher around the edges. This is because 
  the batter doesn't rise near the sausages. In my example the sausages 
  fit rather closely in the dish, so batter flowed over them deep enough 
  to rise in the middle.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp;  Why "Toad in the Hole"?  Food 
  writers have long puzzled over this without resolution - but a good 
  explanation is close at hand. Around 1850 - 1860, when this name 
  first appeared, the English public was in the grips of a craze regarding 
  live toads. They were reportedly found in holes deep within impenetrable 
  rock where they supposedly survived for hundreds or even thousands of 
  years. It's just another recipe named for a popular theme of its day. 
  The dish may predate the name because Yorkshire pudding had been made 
  since at least 1737 - adding a bit of meat to it isn't much of a 
  stretch. The earliest mention, about 1860, has it made with beefsteak 
  and/or beef kidneys.</li>
