"Mulligatawny" is an English distortion for the Tamil words for "Pepper 
Water". The original British 
version was fried onions, broth, pepper and spices, but it has 
been considerably expanded since then (also see <a href="boc_mullig1.html#07">
<b>Note-7</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One seeded Serrano chili, 
  combined with our formula for Madras Curry Powder, gives this soup 
  a distinct, but very tolerable bite. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for Chicken 
  stock and shredded Chicken, but Lamb or Mutton (Goat in India) are 
  alternatives for both stock and shredded meat. If you have no cooked 
  chicken, you can simmer some raw chicken (about 9 ounces, it shrinks) 
  in the stock for 45 minutes before you proceed with the recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> Some recipes call for butter rather 
  than oil (in India this would be Ghee - clarified butter). I use 
  Pure Olive Oil (not virgin).</li>  
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This must be best 
  quality Madras curry powder. Sun or Ship brands are good, but grinding 
  fresh is much better. See our recipe <a href="iys_madras1.html">Madras 
  Curry Powder</a>. Some recipes do call for Indian Garam Masala, but 
  that's less authentic - this is British, not Indian.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call specifically 
  for Basmati rice, but this soup is derived from a Tamil sauce and 
  Madras (now Chennai) curry powder, both from Tamil Nadu in southern 
  India. Thai Jasmine would be closer to the rice used in that region 
  - but do as you like - it's British, so "authenticity" is not much of 
  a factor.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for placing 
  warm rice, chicken and apples into individual serving bowls, then 
  ladling hot soup over, garnishing and serving immediately. This is not 
  at all practical for buffet service - you'll be really lucky even to  
  get people to understand about the rice - they're quite distracted. 
  For buffet, I mix in everything but the rice and place it in a slow 
  cooker set to "keep warm".</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Historical:</h3> &nbsp; An Anglo-Indian cookbook I have 
  (pl6), published in India in 1941, does not use curry powder. It calls 
  for a cloth bag of whole spices: 2 oz Coriander seed, 1 oz cumin seed, 
  1 oz fenugreek, 1/2 oz mustard seed, 2 cl garlic, 12 peppercorns, and 
  4 or 5 bay leaves. Turmeric is expressly omitted. The stock is simmered 
  and the bag is pulled when it reaches the right flavor. This is for 
  about 4 cups of vegetable stock, no chicken, and suggests a few drops 
  of Tabasco sauce (not exactly Indian). It does mention it can also be 
  made the same way with mutton (goat in India) or chicken stock. The 
  title is for "Mulligatawny Soup (clear)", implying the non-clear curry 
  powder seasoned version was also well known.</li>
