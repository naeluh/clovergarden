This stock is quite different from those made today - with a little 
of the Medieval still in it, combined with the Elizabethan fondness for 
things sweet. See <a href="boc_stkliz1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a> for background.

<p>The almonds make the stock a bit murky, but if you must have it clear, 
they will settle out. Think before using this stock for any cuisine save 
Elizabethan or earlier English.</p>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs - see <a href="boc_stkliz1.html#01">
  <b>Note-1</b></a>)
<ol>
<li>Peel <b>ONIONS</b> and quarter lengthwise. Mix together all 
  <b>Onion mix</b> items.</li>
<li>In an 8-quart pot, place the <b>Chicken Parts</b>, <b>Lamb Shank</b> 
  and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil skim off all 
  the sludge that rises to the top. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b>, bring 
  back to a boil, cover and simmer slowly for about 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Grind <b>ALMONDS</b> very fine - as close to paste as you can get 
  them. Pit <b>DATES</b> and chop medium. Mix both with 
  <b>Currants</b>.</li>
<li>When <b>Chicken</b> has simmered 45 minutes, stir in <b>Almond 
  mix</b> and <b>White Wine</b>. Bring back to a simmer and simmer 
  slowly for another 1 hour.</li>
<li>Strain <b>Stock</b> through a fine wire strainer, discarding 
  solids.</li>
<li>De-fat <b>Stock</b> thoroughly (see <a href="boc_stkliz1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).
  </li>
<li>Bring back to a boil in a clean pot. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> 
  and <b>Pepper</b>. If not using immediately, put up in jars and 
  refrigerate when cool. If holding more than 5 days, see our page 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Parts:</h3> &nbsp; I usually buy a 10 
  pound bag of leg quarters, which will produce 4-1/2 pounds of soup 
  parts after I have extracted the skinless-boneless thigh and leg meat 
  (for use in some other recipe). If you do it this way, add an hour to 
  the time for disassembling the leg quarters. You can also toss in some 
  gizzards, hearts, wings, feet, necks, etc. All fat goes in with 
  skins bones and other stuff. Fats are not water soluble, but some of 
  the flavors they carry are, and it's easy to remove the fat at the end 
  of cooking using your gravy separator. For more details see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lamb Shank:</h3> &nbsp; This works best if you 
  have your meat man saw it into 2 inch lengths.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dates:</h3> &nbsp; Deglet or similar dates are 
  good here. The big ultra-sweet Medjools were available only to the 
  Moroccan royal household until after 1927. In that year 11 sprouts 
  were sent to California to preserve the variety from possible 
  extinction due to disease.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Currants:</h3> &nbsp; I don't know if real 
  currants were much available in Elizabethan England, but they 
  certainly aren't today, or in North America either. We will use Zante 
  Currants (just "Currants" in England) which are tiny grapes dried to 
  raisins.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>De-fat:</h3> &nbsp; Use your gravy separator. It'll 
  take several batches so pour off only 2/3 of what's in the separator 
  before refilling to keep fat out of the pour spout. An alternate to the 
  gravy separator is to refrigerate the stock overnight to solidify the 
  fat layer, then peel it off.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Background:</h3> &nbsp;  This recipe is derived from one by Sir 
  Hugh Plat, published in his book <i>Delights for Ladies</i>. Sir Hugh 
  died (1608) 5 years after the death of Queen Elizabeth I, and 8 years 
  before the death of William Shakespeare. Many of his recipes are on 
  the sweet side, because that was the preference of the time. This 
  sweetness was obtained from dried fruits, because sugar was still 
  exotic and very expensive. It was so exotic and expensive it was 
  presumed to be a powerful medicinal for treatment of all manner of 
  human ailments. Our own "health food" industry follows this same 
  principle to this day.</li>
