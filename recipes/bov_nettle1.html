Times past in Ireland, nourishing nettles were often made into soup in 
times of scarcity. Today they remain part of Irish culinary culture. In 
the photo this soup is garnished with a dollop of cream swirled with a 
stick, and a grind of pepper, but parsley leaves look good too.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and dice about 1/4 inch. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Float wash <b>NETTLES</b> like you would spinach. Wear rubber gloves 
    if your skin is tender. Discard tough stems 
    (those turning reddish), drain well and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEKS</b> down to the white, yellow and light green. Cut in 
    half lengthwise from just below the root to the top. Spread the leaves 
    and rinse well. Start at the top end slice them thin crosswise right 
    down to the root end (see <a href="bov_potatoleek1x.html#gallery">
    <b>Photo Gallery</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b>, slice and chop small. Add to leeks. </li>

  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> in a heavy bottomed sauce pan and fry 
    <b>Leek mix</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> over very moderate 
    heat, stirring often until soft but not at all browned.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    until potatoes are quite tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Separate out 3/4 c of <b>Potatoes</b> and set aside for texture.
  <li>Stir in <b>Nettles</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer about 2 
    minutes.</li>
  <li> Run in a food processor until pur&eacute;e is quite smooth.</li>
  <li>Pour pur&eacute; and reserved potatoes back into the pot.  Bring 
    back to a boil. Add water or stock if needed for consistency.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat and stir in <b>Cream</b>. Check seasoning and serve 
    immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; While the Irish use only 
  russets for everything, I use White Rose which stays a little firmer 
  so the reserved cubes work better. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Nettles:</h3> &nbsp; These should be tender tops of 
  young nettles. If you live in a region with humidity and streams you may 
  be able to cut them yourself (wear gloves - they sting). Here in 
  Southern California they can sometimes be obtained from herb growers 
  at local Farmer's Markets. Incidentally, they are much more likely to 
  sting when you brush against them lightly than when you handle 
  them firmly. For details see our <a href="../ingred/od_nettlz.html">
  <b>Nettles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This soup can easily be made well ahead 
  right up to the point of stirring in the nettles. Once the nettles 
  are in it must be finished quickly because the bright green color soon 
  fades.</li>
