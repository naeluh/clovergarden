These pickled beets are considered the "must have" accompaniment for 
the famous <a href="bmm_scouse1.html"><b>Scouse</b></a> stew of 
Liverpool, but they have many other uses as well.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 day - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> just until done through. Determine this by running 
    a sharp skewer through the center of the largest one - it should not 
    encounter a hard spot. Cool the beets enough to handle, rub off the 
    skins and stems, and cut out any grungy parts.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets</b> about 3/16th inch thick and cut slices into 
    quarters (or however you like).</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Beet slices</b> into a sterile jar (not too tight).</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b> in a pot and bring to a boil. Simmer 
    for about 10 minutes, then strain into jar of <b>Beets</b>.</li>
  <li>Push the Beets down into the Pickle. Seal the jar and let mature 
    a couple of days in a cool place. Actually, I usually start eating 
    them within a few hours. They will keep a couple of months in the 
    fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This is properly White 
  Wine Vinegar.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Many cooks say beets must 
  be roasted in the oven, but I live in sunny Southern California, where 
  we don't fire up a hot oven unless we really need to. I find boiling 
  the beets for this recipe works fine.
