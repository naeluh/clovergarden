A tasty side dish indeed. You could even use it as a main dish for two 
if you add maybe half again as much potato. It can be made ahead and 
reheated - add a dash more milk if needed.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>TRIPE</b> in several changes of water. Slice into narrow 
    strips about 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Tripe</b> and all <b>Broth items</b> into a pot, bring to 
    a boil and simmer until tripe is tender, about 3 hours.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b>, split in half lengthwise and slice crosswise 
    about 1/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Potatoes</b> and slice less than 1/4 inch. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>BOILING ONIONS</b> - blanch in boiling water for 1 minute to 
    make this easier. Cut as little off the ends as possible so they hold 
    together well.</li>
  <li>When tender, drain <b>Tripe</b> and rinse. Rinse pan and return 
    tripe. Add <b>Milk</b>, <b>Sliced Onions</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>. 
    Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil (watch 
    carefully or it'll boil over) cover and simmer over very low heat 
    for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Boiling Onions</b>, break up the <b>Potatoes</b> a bit 
    more if they need it and continue to simmer covered until onions are 
    just tender - about 15 minutes. If you're using onion chunks instead, 
    give them a bit less time.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; Three types of tripe will be found in North 
  American markets. Honeycomb is called for here and holds the sauce 
  better than blanket, but blanket will also work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page. Tripe 
  sold here is already thoroughly scraped, par-boiled and bleached white, 
  so you need not concern yourself with scraping off the crusty green 
  crud. Note that in Ireland sheep tripe would be traditionally used but 
  today beef tripe is common.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; In Ireland only russets are used, 
  but I prefer White Rose which make it a bit more chunky. Boiling 
  potatoes would be too firm and "Yukon Gold" types have the wrong flavor 
  and turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Boiling Onions:</h3> &nbsp;  These should be quite small, about 
  1-3/8 inches or smaller. If you don't have these you can use a larger 
  onion cut into wedges, then cut the wedges in half crosswise.</li>
