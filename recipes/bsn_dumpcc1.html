These are a traditional dumpling that accompanies stews in the West 
Country of England, used for centuries before potatoes became available 
in England. Note: these are not "lean cuisine".

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>SUET</b> as fine as you can get it.
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> fine.</li>  
  <li>Run <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> to powder in your spice grinder 
    so they mix  well with the flour.</li>
  <li>Work all <b>Dry Items</b> together with the <b>Flour</b> (8 oz = 
    1-1/2 cup) until evenly distributed. Getting this even and free of 
    lumps is hard to do by hand, so I use a food processor with the sharp 
    metal blade.</li>
  <li>Slowly mix in <b>Water</b> (or other watery liquid - about 1/4 cup) 
    to make a moderately stiff dough.</li> 
  <li>Set out a plate with <b>Flour</b> as needed. With flour powdered 
    hands Form the <b>Dough</b> into balls between 3/4 and 1 inch 
    diameter. Roll them in the <b>Flour</b> to coat lightly. At this 
    point they can be refrigerated until needed.</li>
  <li>Oil the steamer basket to reduce sticking and steam the dumplings 
    for about 12 minutes. Give each one space as they will swell 
    considerably.
    <p></p>
    Many English recipes have you place the dumplings carefully on top 
    of the finished stew or potage being made in the oven, leaving the 
    pot uncovered, then removing them when done (about 20 minutes). I 
    find it a lot safer and easier to just steam them in a steamer, and 
    they can be made ahead that way. Some recipes say you can boil them, 
    but that doesn't work at all well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Suet:</h3> &nbsp; An ingredient much used in 
  England, but not so much here. It is fresh hard beef fat from around 
  the kidneys. In a pinch, use whatever firm white beef fat you can get. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_suetz.html"><b>Suet / Tallow</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheddar Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Use a real, properly aged cheddar. 
  The industrial grades from the big brand names don't melt right.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Flour, Self Rising:</b> &nbsp; This four is much 
  used in England. It's less used here, but most supermarkets have it. 
  You can make your own per our recipe 
  <a href="gig_floursr1.html"><b>Self Rising Flour</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; Milk and cold beef stock are also used.</li>
