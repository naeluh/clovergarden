A very popular traditional Irish dish that makes a fine, easy to make side 
dish in place of plain mashed potatoes. It is also made with head cabbage, 
but I prefer kale (a loose leaf cabbage) for color and flavor.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes. Put in a pot 
    with water to cover, bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes 
    or until tender. Drain and mash.</li>
  <li>Cut large stems from <b>KALE</b> and put leaves in a pot separate 
    from the potatoes, bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes 
    until tender. Drain, chop fairly small and squeeze out excess water.
    </li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEKS</b> down to the white, yellow and light green 
    (see <a href="bsv_potkale1x.html#gallery"><b>Gallery</b></a>). 
    Starting at the green end slice them thin crosswise right down to 
    the root end.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Butter</b> in a heavy bottomed sauce pan and fry 
    <b>Leeks</b> over moderate heat, stirring often until soft but not 
    at all browned. Stir in <b>Milk</b>, cover and simmer slowly for about 
    8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in mashed <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, 
    then stir in the <b>Kale</b> and 4 T <b>Butter</b>. Stir over moderate 
    heat until hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with bits of butter. This dish can be reheated 
    in the oven if made ahead.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The general purpose White Rose will work 
  fine, but is not "authentic", as the Irish refuse to use any but 
  russets. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tradition:</h3> &nbsp; Colcannon was served on Halloween, and at 
  that time was used in various ways for marriage divination, generally 
  by imbedding various items in it to be found by those eating it. 
  Halloween being a pagan holiday (Celtic Samhain) there must have been 
  an ancient predecessor from before potatoes, but I have not yet been 
  able to identify it. This dish may be made with either cabbage or kale, 
  but kale (a loose leaf cabbage) gives better color and flavor. 
  Traditional Irish kale is flat leaf and more tender than the curly 
  leaf kale we have in North America, but either will work. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_kalez.html"><b>Kale</b></a> page.</li>
