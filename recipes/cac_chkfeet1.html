A standard in Chinese dim sum tea houses.  This dish is better suited 
to parties or restaurants than to home use because the hassle and 
clean-up is as much for a small batch as for a large. Deep 
frying is necessary to achieve the desirable puffy texture.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5+ hrs 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean and rinse <b>CHICKEN FEET</b>. Cut off the toenails with your 
    kitchen shears and pick off any fragments of the yellow outer skin that 
    may be found. Blanch 3 minutes in boiling water and quench in cold 
    water. Drain thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Brush <b>Chicken Feet</b> all over with <b>Dark Soy Sauce</b> (the 
    sugar in dark soy sauce is needed). Drain the feet well, then let them 
    dry thoroughly - this is important to minimize oil splatter. Either 
    spread on a baking sheet or in the tray they came in, overnight in the 
    refrigerator, covered with just a paper towel. If refrigerated allow 
    them to come to room temperature before frying.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C in a spacious fryer. I use an 
    Indian kadhai which contains splattering better than a wok or pan. Cover 
    your kitchen floor with newspapers for a distance of about 4 feet. 
    Fry <b>Chicken Feet</b> in batches until lightly browned (not easy 
    to tell with the dark soy on them but they'll start to feel just a bit 
    crispy as you push them around). Drain well</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> and place in a pot with <b>Water</b>, <b>Star 
    Anise</b> and <b>Scallions</b>. Stir in <b>Chicken Feet</b> and bring 
    to a boil. Simmer 1-1/2 hours, <u>no more</u> and <u>no less</u>.</li>
  <li>Sort out <b>Chicken Feet</b> and discard other solids keeping 1-1/2 
    cup of the simmering liquid.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop fine. Seed <b>Chilis</b> and 
    chop fine. Mix both with <b>Black Bean Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan Heat 1T <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Bean 
    Sauce mix</b> until fragrant. Stir in <b>Chicken Feet</b> and fry 
    stirring gently until well coated.</li>
  <li>Stir in all <b>Sauce Items</b> and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Make a slurry of <b>Cornstarch</b> and <b>Water</b>. Stir into the 
    pan to thicken the sauce.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with tea, warm or cold with beer.  These are properly 
    eaten by picking up with chopsticks (chopstick skills needed) and 
    start eating at the toes, one joint at a time, spitting out the 
    bones when stripped of the edible part.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Feet:</h3> &nbsp; Purchase thoroughly clean 
  with the yellow scaly outer skin removed. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bd_chkfeetz.html">Chicken Feet</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; You need enough oil to submerge the 
  feet well or they will tend to spit oil all about. Use a stable, high 
  temperature frying oil (Olive Pomace, Peanut, Rice Bran).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Fresnos are fine, or Serranos if you 
  want to go hotter. See our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a> 
  for details.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A commercial sauce can 
  be used if you can find it, or make it at home by our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/cjv_blkbean1.html"><b>Black Bean Sauce</b></a> &nbsp;
<li id="05">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp;  Chinese usually use dark soy 
  sauce which results in a darker color and sweeter flavor. I usually use 
  regular soy sauce as in the photo.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Chinese 
  rice wine, lacking that use a dry Sherry. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
