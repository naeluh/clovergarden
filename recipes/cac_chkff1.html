No, it doesn't smell or taste like fish - just the dressing is similar 
to dressings used on fish. This one can serve as an cold appetizer, or 
as a cold chicken salad. See <a href="cac_chkff1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<p>This is a fairly substantial and distinctly flavorful dish, so it 
could stretch to even 5 for salad. As an appetizer, 6 to 12 depending
on how you serve it.</p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Simmer <b>CHICKEN</b> with a few chunks of smacked ginger and 
     a few scallions. Simmer until just done. Let the Chicken cool 
     in the broth, then remove and refrigerate. See Notes 
     <a href="cac_chkff1.html#01"><b>1</b></a> and <a href="cac_chkff1.html#04"><b>4</b></a>.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Dressing:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>In a small pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over low heat. Stir in <b>Sambal 
    Oelek</b> and stir until the oil is red and fragrant. Set aside 
    to cool.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut into thin slivers, and then 
    chop the slivers very fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine.
    Slice <b>SCALLION GREENS</b> crosswise very thin. Mix all 
    <b>Dressing items</b> (including Sambal Oelek and it's Oil).</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 min + rest)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut <b>Chicken</b> into bite size pieces (about 3/4 inch).</li>
  <li>Shake up <b>Dressing</b> and pour over the <b>Chicken</b>. Toss 
    to coat the Chicken well. Let rest awhile in the fridge if you 
    have time.</li>
  <li>Serve cool.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; I always use whole skin-on thighs for best 
  flavor and texture, and best broth. You'll need 2-3/4 pounds of 
  skin-on, bone in Thighs to make 1 pound of simmered meat, but 
  you'll get plenty of broth from it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sambal Oelek</h3> &nbsp; This is an Indonesian Chili Sauce, but 
  approved by &uuml;ber expert Fuchsia Dunlop for use instead of chopping 
  4 T Sichuan Pickled Chilis (which she can't get in England) and mixing 
  with 4 T Chili Oil. This mix would not need the heating step given 
  above. She does not define the pickled chilis, but all the Asian 
  markets here carry Thai produced pickled chilis and no others, so I 
  presume they would work. For Sambal Oelek, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; This is a staple ingredient for Chinese 
  cooking. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china">
  <b>Vinegars &amp; Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chicken Broth</h3> &nbsp; This recipe makes quite a bit of broth, 
  but uses only a few Tablespoons. The rest can be used for other 
  recipes. I always include skins, bones and fat when simmering 
  Chicken. After the meat is done, cooled and removed, I give the 
  broth and all the skins, bones, and stuff in it another hour or more 
  of simmering. I then strain it, defat it using my gravy separator, 
  and refrigerate it until needed. For full details of making and 
  storing, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / 
  Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This recipe could be made, then chopped up 
  and used for toppings or to stuff eggs.</li>
