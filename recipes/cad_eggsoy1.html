A common breakfast egg, appetizer or snack in China, these are easy to 
make and more flavorful than plain hard boiled eggs. Of course there are 
many variations, so don't take the exact proportions too seriously.

  <li>Hard boil the eggs and peel off the shells For easiest peeling 
    and best texture follow the exact method given in our recipe 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a suitable pan (probably the one you boiled the eggs in), mix 
    all <b>Flavorings items</b>. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a 
    simmer and carefully place the <b>Eggs</b> in. This prevents burned 
    spots on the eggs while the liquid is brought to a boil over high 
    heat. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: the eggs must not float in the flavoring 
    liquid or they'll stay one side up and not color evenly. They have to 
    be resting on the bottom of the pan.</li>
  <li>As the liquid comes back to a simmer, turn the eggs every so often 
    to make sure they color evenly. Continue to simmer for 1-1/2 hours, 
    turning now and then, and adding boiling water if needed. Take off 
    the heat and allow to sit, continuing to turn them, for another half 
    hour.</li>
  <li>If I don't need them right away, I seal the eggs in a plastic 
    bag with the flavoring liquid and refrigerate overnight, turning 
    now and then.</li>
  <li><b>Eggs</b> may be served either cold (most common) or warm.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Eggs:</b> &nbsp; For recipes of this sort always 
  use Medium eggs, as the flavorings can penetrate them more deeply. 
  Don't bother aging the eggs before boiling - it makes no difference 
  at all. For the most successful up-to-date methods, see our recipe 
  <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>.</li>
