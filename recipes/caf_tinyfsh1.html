These tiny fried fish are spicier than most recipes, so go well with 
a simple dip of good vinegar. I use my favorite Philippine Data Puti 
Native Cane Vinegar, but many others would work fine too.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (10 min work + 25 min if you gut 
    the fish (see <a href="caf_tinyfsh1.html#05">Note-5</a>) plus 30 min marindade
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>TINY FISH</b> as desired (see <a href="caf_tinyfsh1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).  
    </li>
  <li>Smash <b>GINGER</b> moderately with your kitchen mallet and slice 
    about 1/4 inch. Similarly crush <b>SCALLIONS</b> and cut into 1 inch 
    lengths. Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and tumble well with 
    <b>Fish</b>. Set aside for 30 minutes or so, tumbling now and then 
    for even marinating.</li> 
  <li>Grind <b>Chilis</b> (if needed) and <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>). 
    Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (about 30 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Drain fish well in a strainer. Pick out all the Ginger and 
    Scallions and discard them.</li>
  <li>In a kadhai or wok, bring <b>Oil</b> to a frying temperature, 
    about 370&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Tumble the fish with <b>Potato Starch</b> to coat evenly. Add a 
    little Sea Salt if you want.</li>
  <li>Working in batches so they aren't crowded, fry <b>Fish</b> until 
    crisp. You will notice a sudden decrease in the amount of bubbling 
    that indicates they are about cooked through, so now you need only 
    be concerned with color and crispness. Drain on paper towels.</li> 
  <li>Pour out the <b>Oil</b> and wipe the wok or kadhai clean with 
    paper towels. Return 2 T of the <b>Oil</b> to the pan and heat over 
    moderate flame until about 300&deg;F/150&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> until fragrant (just a few seconds - it 
    must not burn). Stir in <b>Fish</b> and tumble well to coat with 
    the seasonings. Serve immediately. They are best served warm, but 
    they can be refreshed in a moderately hot oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tiny Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Various tiny fish can be used, preferably 
  ones with scales so thin you needn't scale them. The photo example 
  was made with Lady Carp from Vietnam, 4 inches or less nose to tip of 
  tail, because that's what I had on hand. Fuchsia Dunlop calls for 
  "Whitebait", which, in England, are about 3 inches long, thin, and 
  definitely eaten "head, guts, and feathers". I gutted the Lady Carp in 
  the photo, as they are river fish, a possibly more polluted 
  environment, and they had quite a lot of stuff in them. In China, 
  "Whitebait" would be the larger <b>Silver Fish</b>, about 4 inches 
  long.  For details, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_whtbaitz.html">
  <b>Whitebait</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; I take whole dried chilis, Japones, 
  de Arbols, or Thai, and give them a spin in my whirling blade spice 
  grinder, so they are not as fine as commercial powder. 2 teaspoons 
  of de Arbol worked fine for me, but folks from the Frozen North 
  might appreciate a little less.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  now again legal in the US so long as they are lightly toasted. These 
  are nothing at all like black pepper. 1 teaspoon of Sichuan 
  Peppercorns gave the fish a pretty good tingle. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Timing:</h3> &nbsp; How long this recipe takes depends on the 
  variety and condition of the fish when you buy them, and on their 
  size. headless smelts are usually also gutted. If you have rather 
  small whole fish, and want them gutted, it can take up to 30 minutes. 
  12 ounces (46 fish) of Lady Carp took 25 minutes to gut, leaving the 
  heads on. It would take a bit less if the heads were removed, and 
  fewer larger fish would take a fair amount less time.</li>
