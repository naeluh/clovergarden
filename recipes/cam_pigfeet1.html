An appetizer porkophiles will love, served hot with sauce or cold.  Hot 
with sauce these are delicious but messy - have finger bowls and paper 
napkins. Cold, plain or with dips (see <a href="cam_pigfeet1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>) 
they are still not "white tablecloth".

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs - 50 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> to remove bone chips and dry thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> very hot in a kadhai, wok or other suitable frying 
    vessel and fry <b>Pig Feet</b> in batches until lightly browned all 
    over - as evenly as you can get with something so irregular in shape. 
    Keep the oil fairly shallow for good browning. Drain well.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Pig Feet</b> in a pot and add <b>Water</b> until Pig Feet 
    are just covered. Add <b>HOT CHILIS</b> sliced in half lengthwise, 
    <b>GINGER</b> sliced medium, <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Rice Wine</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender - 
    about 2 hours. They should hold their shape but bones should pull 
    apart easily. If you will be serving them cold cook just a touch 
    softer as they will stiffen.</li>
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> you will be serving them warm with sauce, keep 
    <b>Pig Feet</b> warm while you de-fat the liquid (use your gravy 
    separator) and boil it down to about 1/3 for sauce. I like just a 
    sprinkle of black pepper in it too.  cut the <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> into 
    narrow stips, heat a little of the oil very hot and stir fry over 
    high flame until crisp tender (a little charing is good). Plate 
    <b>Pig Feet</b>, garnish with <b>Bell Pepper</b> strips and ladle 
    some sauce over.</li>
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> you will be serving them chilled, just drain 
    <b>Pig Feet</b> well and refrigerate. Boil the sauce down anyway, 
    it's delicious with other meats and vegetables.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely 
  available in ethnic markets here in Southern California (except Jewish 
  and Islamic of course), they are commonly already cut into pieces and 
  shrink wrapped in plastic trays. If you find them whole have the 
  butcher saw them in half lengthwise and once or twice across 
  depending on size (4 or 6 pieces). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese recipes call for very little oil and 
  depend on rendered fat for frying. Our American pig feet are too lean 
  to render fat so we need some oil. I use Olive Pomace oil for its high 
  smoke point, neutral flavor and durability. Keep the oil fairly shallow 
  to promote browning.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Here you can control the hotness to your 
  comfort level. One large Seranno makes the sauce moderately hot by 
  Southern California standards. See our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
  <b>Chilis</b></a> for details.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dips:</h3> &nbsp; I admit to eating these mostly plain, but grated 
  horseradish, hot mustard and rice vinegar with a little salt all work 
  well.</li>
