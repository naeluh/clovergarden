This is an interesting and attracive cold appetizer. It should be made up 
as shown just before serving because if mixed up the celery will absorb the 
sauce and be much less attractive. It can, of course, be made up into 
individual servings.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr (30 min work))
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>KIDNEYS</b> in half horizontally to expose the internal fat 
    and plumbing which must be carefully removed. In this case I found it 
    a lot easier to cut it away after slicing.</li>
  <li>Slice the kidneys as thin as you can on a diagonal (to make the 
    slices wider). Place immediately in a bowl of cold water. Change the 
    water a few times for 1/2 hour or so.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CELERY</b> into 2 inch lengths, then cut the pieces lengthwise 
    as thin as you can.</li>
  <li> Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hours (15 min work))
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain kidney slices well.</li>
  <li>In a pot bring at least 2 quarts of <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil. 
    Turn off the heat and immediately pour in the <b>Celery</b>. Stir for 
    about 45 seconds only, then scoop out the celery and refresh it in 
    cold running water.</li>
  <li>Bring the pot back to a boil. Again turn off the heat and pour in 
    the <b>Kidney Slices</b>. Let sit until cooked through, just a minute 
    or so. Test by pulling out one of the thicker slices and breaking it, 
    if it's not bloody inside it's done. Drain and immediately refresh in 
    cold running water (the slices will toughen if cooked much longer).</li>
  <li>Chill <b>Kidneys</b> and <b>Celery</b> until ready to serve. When 
    ready, layer the <b>Celery</b> on the serving dish, then arrange the 
    <b>Kidneys</b> over. Stir up the <b>Sauce</b> and pour it over the 
    kidneys..</li>
  <li>Serve cold.</li>
