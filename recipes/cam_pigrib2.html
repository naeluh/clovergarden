Tender and tasty and with a chili bite. This is a good "finger-food" appetizer 
because they are not real sticky. This recipe requires little attention 
and no frying oil.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths of 1-1/2 to 2 inches. 
    A sharp Chinese cleaver knife is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Pork Ribs</b> in a steamer and steam over boiling water. 
    If the ribs are from the thin end, about 1/2 hour, if from the thick 
    end about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile prepare the paste: &nbsp; Put the <b>Chilis</b>, 
    <b>Sugar</b> and <b>Salt</b> in your spice grinder and grind to a 
    fine powder. Avoid breathing any dust or you will sneeze up a 
    storm.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Chili Powder</b> with <b>Rice Flour</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Rice Vinegar</b> and then very slowly stir in water until you have 
    a thick paste suitable for coating the ribs.</li>
  <li>Cool <b>Pork Ribs</b> until they can be handled easily. In a mixing 
    bowl work the <b>Paste</b> into them until they are all completely 
    coated.</li> 
  <li>Clean the steamer basket and return the ribs to it. Bring steaming 
    water back to a high boil and steam the ribs another 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Thai chilis will result in a 
  fairly distinct bite - fine for Southern California but perhaps a bit 
  much for folks in the Frozen North. Arbols are a suitable substitute, 
  not as hot but larger. For a milder effect use Japones. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a>.</li>
