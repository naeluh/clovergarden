Flower Tofu is fresh tofu just as coagulated and not pressed. It is usually 
eaten with a selection of dips.	Many steps, but not difficult. See  
<a href="cap_tofuf1.html#04"><b>Equipment</b></a> and also 
<a href="cap_tofuf1.html#05"><b>Cheating</b></a> (highly recommended).

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10+ hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>Soy Beans</b> overnight in cool <b>Water</b> with 1/2 T 
    <b>Salt</b>. Change the Water/Salt mix once or twice.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Drain <b>Soy Beans</b>, rinse, and drain well. Mix with 4 cups 
    fresh <b>Water</b> and 1/4 t <b>Oil</b>. Run in a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender until smooth.
    &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Do not fill your Mixie can or Blender 
    jar more than half full. This stuff will foam mercilessly while blending.
    The beans will be quite firm, so the grinding will take some time.</li>
  <li>Place a generous sheet of Muslin (2 x 2 feet) in a large Wire Strainer 
    set over a large bowl. Pour the <b>Soy Milk mix</b> into the Muslin to 
    drain, which it will not do.</li>
  <li>Add 1-1/2 cups <b>Water</b> to the Mixie or Blender. Run for a few 
    seconds, and pour this water into the strainer with the rest. If you 
    have some hard bean parts left, you can add them and grind longer.</li>
  <li>Wrap the Muslin over the pulp, twist it at the top to seal, and wring 
    out as much Soy Milk as you can. This will take patience and strength - 
    it doesn't wring out easily. Send the pulp to the compost (it is used in 
    some Chinese and Japanese recipes).</li>
  <li>Pour the Soy Milk into a suitable pan. I use a 3-1/2 quart Saut&eacute; 
    Pan, which works much better than a Wok. Heat the Soy Milk over moderate 
    flame and watch it closely. When it hits a boil it will foam furiously, 
    just like cow milk. At that point, turn it down to a slow simmer for 
    about 8 minutes. I do this with the cover on, lifting it now and then 
    to make sure foam isn't rising too high.</li>
  <li>Now, during the simmering and cooling phase, you can be cleaning up the 
    mess you made.</li>
  <li>Turn off the heat and let the Soy Milk cool down to 175&deg;F/80&deg;C.
    Again, I do this covered to avoid much skin forming on the top. Fuchsia 
    Dunlop says to leave it open and remove the skins with a chopstick to 
    hang up and dry, but this doesn't work well with so small a batch, is 
    additional hassle, and you need some sort of drying rack.</li>
  <li>As the Soy Milk nears 175&deg;, Heat some Water to a boil. Place the 
    <b>Nigari</b> in a heatproof cup and mix in 1/4 cup of the <b>Hot 
    Water</b> until dissolved (just seconds).</li>
  <li>When the <b>Soy Milk</b> hits 175&deg;, stir in the <b>Nigari</b>, <u>a 
    portion at a time</u>, until you see clouds of Tofu forming, then stop. 
    This will not take the whole amount of Nigari.</li>
  <li>Cover the pan and let the Tofu set for about 5 minutes. Do not stir.</li>
  <li>Finally, you can take a fine wire or nylon sieve and press it into the 
    pan to remove excess whey. Just scoop the water out of the sieve as it 
    fills.</li>
  <li>Now you've got more clean-up to do. Do it right away or it becomes more 
    difficult.</li>
  <li>Serve warm or cool in small bowls, with Herbs and Dips of choice. The 
    dips should have a tiny cocktail spoon in them to spoon dip into the 
    Tofu. in a sealed jar, the Tofu will keep in the fridge for a couple 
    of days.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Soy Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These should be beans specifically for making 
  Tofu and similar uses. I use Laura brand from the Chambers Family, American 
  suppliers to Japanese tofu makers.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Nagari:</h3> &nbsp; This is food grade Magnesium Chloride. It is 
  available on-line from both Japanese and American manufacturers.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dips for Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; See our recipe page 
  <a href="cjv_diptfu1.html"><b>Sichuan Tofu Dips</b></a>. These recipes 
  are based on those recommended by &uuml;ber expert Fuchsia Dunlop in her 
  book <i>The Food of Sichuan</i>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; Besides a powerful Mixie or Blender, you will 
  need a big bowl, a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan (works better than a wok) 
  and a 24 x 24 inch sheet of strong Muslin, medium thread count. Don't use 
  a piece from an old bed sheet or pillow case, the thread count may be too 
  high, and it may have weakened from use and may burst under pressure.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cheating:</h3> &nbsp; Just buy a couple tubs of Silken Tofu, crumble 
  it up with a fork, and serve with a bit of the whey surrounding the curds.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu</b></a> page.
