<ol>
  <li>Cut <b>Pressed Tofu</b> into sticks roughly 0.6 x 0.7 inch sticks, 
    or as desired.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan with enough room to tumble the sticks 
    around, place all the <b>Flavorings items</b>. Bring to a boil, then 
    turn down to a simmer and load in the <b>Tofu Sticks</b>. </li>
  <li>As the liquid comes back to a simmer, start turning the 
    <b>Tofu Sticks</b> every so often to make sure they color evenly. 
    Continue to simmer for 1-1/2 hours, turning now and then, and adding 
    boiling water if needed. Take off the heat and allow to sit, 
    continuing to turn them, for another half hour.</li>
  <li>If I don't need them right away, I seal the sticks in a plastic 
    bag with the flavoring liquid and refrigerate, turning the bag now 
    and then. They will keep for several days.</li>
  <li><b>Tofu Sticks</b> may be served either cold (most common) or 
    warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="1">
  <h3>Pressed Tofu</h3> &nbsp; [Stew Bean Curd, Dou Gan] 
  &nbsp; These stiff blocks can be found on the lightly refrigerated 
  shelves of markets serving a Chinese community. I use a lighter 
  colored non-baked version for this recipe. The standard size for 
  these blocks is 2.6 x 2.3 x 0.7 inches, 4 to a package, weighing 6.7 
  ounces, but other sizes are available. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#press">Tofu</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
