  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim ends from <b>CUCUMBERS</b>. Split lengthwise into quarters, 
    then crosswise into halves. Tumble with <b>Salt</b> and let 
    stand for at least 30 minutes, tumbling now and then.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix with <b>Water</b> and 
    <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Let stand for 30 minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min + overnight)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok of saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Ginger</b> 
    and <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b> stirring until Ginger is lightly 
    browned. Take off heat and scrape Ginger and Peppercorns out 
    into a mixing bowl large enough for the whole recipe - leaving all 
    the Oil in the pan.</li>
  <li>Return pan to the heat. Stir <b>Sugar</b> into the oil and 
    fry stirring until Sugar is melted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Dressing mix</b> and <b>Garlic mix</b>, stirring until 
    well distributed and all sticky lumps of sugar have dissolved. Pour 
    out into the mixing bowl with the Ginger mix.</li> 
  <li>Drain <b>Cucumbers</b> thoroughly. Do not rinse. Stir Cucumbers 
    into the mixing bowl until well coated. Refrigerate overnight. I 
    seal it all in a plastic bag, and turn the bag now and then.</li>
  <li>Adjust seasonings if needed. Serve cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumber:</h3> If at all possible use a thin 
  cucumber like Persian or Japanese that doesn't have to be peeled and 
  seeded. If all you have is the standard green blimps, you will have 
  to peel and seed them, then weigh them.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html">Cucumbers</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a 
  prickly ash tree, now again legal in the US so long as they are 
  lightly toasted. These are nothing at all like black pepper. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">Sichuan Pepper</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This rice vinegar 
  is available in most markets serving an East or Southeast Asian 
  community. That from Chinkiang is considered the best, and Gold 
  Plum is a good brand. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html">Sours</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Paste</h3> &nbsp; Various Chili Pastes 
  can be used. For the photo example I used Huy Fong Chili Garlic 
  Sauce. 2 T made these pickles noticeably but not offensively hot by 
  Southern California standards. While I could easily standi 3 T, I 
  have guests to consider. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html#asia">Chili Sauces</a> page.</li>
