This is a nice, mild pickle with interesting flavor. While it takes time, 
it is easy to make and will keep a few weeks in the fridge.

  <b><u>Make</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 days - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Scrub <b>DAIKON</b> and remove all rootlets. Do not peel. Cut it 
    in half lengthwise and then slice diagonally crosswise a little less 
    than 1/4 inch thick.</li> 
   <li>Place <b>Daikon</b> in a non-reactive shallow bowl and tumble 
     with <b>Salt</b>. Cover with a plate and place a heavy weight on 
     the plate. Let stand in a cool place for at least 24 hours, or up 
     to 48 hours. Uncover and tumble now and then, and replace the 
     plate and weight.</li>
   <li>Mix <b>Pickle Liquid</b> and stir until sugar is dissolved.</li>
   <li>Drain <b>Radishes</b> and squeeze out water. Do not rinse. Clean 
     the bowl and return the radishes. Pour in the <b>Pickle Liquid</b> 
     and tumble. Cover with the plate and refrigerate for another two 
     days (see <a href="cav_radsoy1.html#04">Note-4</a>). Refrigerated, the pickle will 
     keep for about 3 weeks.</li>
  <li>To serve, remove as much <b>Radish</b> as needed. Sprinkle with a 
    very small amount of <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Daikon</h3> &nbsp; Choose a fresh, crisp blemish 
  free, long narrow Daikon. The skin should be very good, as it stays on. 
  1-3/4  pounds is the largest Daikon to buy as larger ones start to get 
  fibrous. If you want to make more than a single recipe, or can't find 
  a nice radish between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 pounds, buy two smaller ones.
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_daikonz.html">Daikon Radish</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Vinegar, Chinese:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese Red 
  Vinegar is quite different from European and not interchangeable. If 
  you can't find it, use a regular aged rice vinegar. Chinese Red Vinegar 
  isn't very red, so some brands include a little FD&amp;C Red #40 to 
  "correct" the color. Pearl River Bridge is a good naturally brewed 
  brand without added color. Some "Shanghai Red Vinegar" includes bran, 
  and is much darker, almost a Black Vinegar.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp;  Asians are sugar freaks, 
  using huge amounts of sugar in everything. I have cut the amount of 
  sugar back from 6 T, as the pattern recipe called for to 4 T, and 
  it's plenty in my opinion, but feel free to adjust to your own taste.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Refrigeration:</h3> &nbsp; I don't have room in 
  my fridge for bowls that have to not spill - so I just seal it all up 
  in a heavy (2 mil) plastic bag with the air squeezed out. The bag can 
  be turned over now and then to redistribute the liquid.</li>
