I have purchased small jars of these pickles from Asian markets here in 
Los Angeles - but they're better (and easily) made at home. This recipe 
uses less sugar than the commercial product, and is crisper.

  <li>Strip Leaves from  <b>STEM LETTUCE</b> and peel the stems with a 
    sharp vegetable peeler until through the layer of white fibers. The 
    peeler will clog a lot, so you'll need to keep clearing the fibers 
    out of it.</li>
   <li>Slice <b>Stem Lettuce</b> about 1/8 inch thick, but not as thick 
     as 1/4 inch.</li>
   <li>Place <b>Stem Lettuce</b> in a non-reactive bowl and sprinkle 
     1 T of <b>Salt</b> over it. Tumble to coat well. Let sit for at 
     least 30 minutes, tumbling a couple of times. Drain the liquid that 
     has accumulated very thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Clean the bowl and return the <b>Stem Lettuce</b>. Sprinkle with 
    1 T of <b>Sugar</b> and tumble to coat evenly.  Let sit for at 
    least 30 minutes, tumbling now and then. Drain the liquid that 
    has accumulated very thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Clean the bowl and return the <b>Stem Lettuce</b>. Add all 
    <b>Pickle items</b> and tumble well.</li>
  <li>Pack the <b>Stem Lettuce</b> in a sterile jar, cover with the 
    pickle liquid, and store in the refrigerator for at least overnight. 
    In the fridge, this pickle will keep for about a month, but it will 
    probably be all eaten long before that.</li>
