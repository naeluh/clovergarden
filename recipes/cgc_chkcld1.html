Many cold chicken dishes are made in Sichuan. They are usually quite 
simple, but distinctly dressed. This one can serve as an cold appetizer, 
or as a cold chicken salad.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; I always use whole skin-on thighs for best 
  flavor and texture, and best broth. You'll need 2-1/2 pounds of 
  skin-on, bone in Thighs to make 14 ounces of simmered meat, but 
  you'll get plenty of broth from it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dry Roasted Peanuts</h3> &nbsp;  An ingredient here, but most often 
  used a garnish for many Chinese and Southeast Asian recipes, these 
  have a much different flavor and texture than commercial roasted 
  peanuts. See our recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted 
  Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; This is a staple ingredient for Chinese 
  cooking. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china">
  <b>Vinegars &amp; Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chicken Broth</h3> &nbsp; This recipe makes quite a bit of broth, 
  but uses only a few Tablespoons. The rest can be used for other 
  recipes. I always include skins, bones and fat when simmering 
  Chicken. After the meat is done, cooled and removed, I give the 
  broth and all the skins, bones, and stuff in it another hour or more 
  of simmering. I then strain it, defat it using my gravy separator, 
  and refrigerate it until needed. For full details of making and 
  storing, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / 
  Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Oil</h3> &nbsp; This is a pantry staple in southern China. 
  It is easy to make with both oil and its sediment used in recipes. 
  Commercial Chili Oil is usually too hot, lacks flavor, and lacks the 
  sediment. See our recipe <a href="cis_chiloil1.html"><b>Chili 
  Oil</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always be on hand for 
  those cuisines. They are available already toasted in Asian markets, 
  but are better and more reliably fresh made at home. See our easy 
  recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>. 
  Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, they will 
  last for several months.</li>
