Jellyfish Salads are very popular banquet dishes in China, plain, or with 
other ingredients. The steps after soaking should not be done too far 
ahead, because the jellyfish will continue to lose water. This recipe 
makes 4 generous appetizer salads.

<b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6-1/2 hours - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>JELLYFISH</b>. If you are fortunate enough to have 
    bought desalted jellyfish, just rinse. Otherwise, soak 6 hours or 
    overnight in the fridge, changing the water twice. If you are in 
    a hurry, an hour at room temperature with 4 or 5 changes of water 
    should do. Never use hot water.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Jellyfish</b> and wring it out. Cut into strips about 
    1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Jellyfish</b> in a cold saucepan. Pour in enough cold 
    <b>Water</b> to just cover well. Strain out the <b>Jellyfish</b> 
    and return the <b>Water</b> to the pan. Bring to a boil, turn off 
    the heat and let sit uncovered until water is about 
    190&deg;F/90&deg;C (about 2 minutes). Stir in <b>Jellyfish</b> for 
    just <u>30 seconds</u>. Drain quickly and refresh with cold water. 
    Drain well and wring out.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in cool water for about 20 minutes. Remove 
    hard attach points and tear into strips.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBER</b> into thin juliennes 2 to 2-1/2 inches long.
    Cap and core <b>RED CHILI</b>. Slice into very thin strips. Mix 
    both with drained <b>Black Fungus</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix together all 
    <b>Dressing Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLION</b> and <b>CILANTRO</b> for Garnish. Mix.</li>
  <li>Keep everything well cooled.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Wring any remaining water out of <b>Jellyfish</b>. Tumble with 
    <b>Cucumber mix</b>.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, pour in <b>Dressing</b> and tumble until 
    well coated.</li>
 <li>Serve cold garnished with <b>Scallion mix</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Jellyfish</b> &nbsp; This is an important 
  ingredient in East and Southeast Asia, so most Asian markets will 
  have it. It's generally found in plastic pouches, heavily salted and 
  packed in brine. I do know one market here in Los Angeles that 
  has it desalted in tubs. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/seajellyw.html">Working with Jellyfish</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Black Fungus:</b> &nbsp; [Wood Ears, Cloud Ears] 
  These thin, wrinkled black mushrooms can be found in just about any 
  market serving an Asian community as they are a popular ingredient. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html">Black Fungus</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Cucumber:</b> If at all possible use a thin 
  cucumber like Persian or Japanese that doesn't have to be peeled and 
  seeded. If all you have is the standard green blimps, you will have 
  to peel and seed them, then weigh them.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html">Cucumbers</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Red Chili:</b> &nbsp; Around here we all use 
  red Fresno chilis, but Holland Red or other medium hot chilis will 
  also work.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Chingkiang Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; This is the best 
  of the "black" vinegars. It is easily available in most markets that 
  serve an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html">Sours</a> page.</li>
