  <b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs + Cooling time - 
    20 min work - do a day ahead)
  <ol>
  <li>Toast <b>Sesame Seeds</b> if you don't have them already on hand 
    </li>
  <li>Make <b>Chili Oil</b> if you don't have it already on hand.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BEEF</b>. Place in a pot with water to cover well and 
    bring to a full boil for 3 minutes. Dump out in the sink. Clean 
    the pot. Rinse crud off the beef and place back into the cleaned 
    pot.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Ginger Root</b> about 3/8 inch thick. Lightly crush 
    <b>Scallions</b>. Leave <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b> whole. Add 
    all <b>Broth items</b> to the pot along with <b>Water</b> to 
    cover well.</li>
  <li> Bring to a boil, then simmer until Beef is tender, usually about 
    2 hours, depending on cut. Timing is <u>critical</u> - you must not 
    overcook or Beef will fall apart when you try to slice it.</li>
  <li>If possible, let Beef cool in the Broth. In any case, do not 
    attempt to slice Beef until it is fully cold.</li>
  <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of defatted broth. The rest can be saved for 
    other uses if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Dressing:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min - can do a day ahead)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Grind <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    very fine. Mix all <b>Dressing items</b> in a small jar. Include 
    some of its Sediment with the Chili Oil.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Topping:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">
   <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> rather coarse - measure is moderately packed 
     after chopping. Chop <b>SCALLION GREENS</b> and <b>CELERY</b> fine. 
     Mix all <b>Topping items</b>.
   </ol>
  <b><u>Serving:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into fairly thin slices. Layer 
    on a serving dish deep enough to contain the dressing.</li>
  <li>Shake up the <b>Dressing</b> well and pour over the <b>Beef</b>.
    Sprinkle <b>Garnish</b> over the top. </li>
  <li>Serve cold to just cool, as you prefer</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. 
  On the other hand, beef with too little fat lacks flavor, there should 
  be a little marbled through it. I usually use boneless Chuck Roast.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Oil</h3> &nbsp; Made per our recipe this is not super hot. 
  The amount called for in this recipe is significantly reduced from 
  Sichuan practice, and is a little mild for me, but should be fine 
  for most people accustomed to chili heat. If I were serving guests 
  of uncertain tolerance, I might cut the amount 1/3 with a neutral 
  oil, but certainly no further. Do remember to include some of the 
  sediment with the oil, it's a flavoring ingredient. See our recipe 
  <a href="cis_chiloil1.html"><b>Chili Oil</b></a></li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always be on hand for 
  these cuisines. They are available already toasted in Asian markets, 
  but are better and more reliable freshly made at home. See our easy 
  recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>. 
  Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, they will 
  last for several months.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe also scatters on a good 
  portion of crushed roasted peanuts with the topping. I've never been 
  fond of the peanut garnish, so I have instead simply increased the 
  amount of toasted Sesame Seeds, and made them mandatory.</li>
