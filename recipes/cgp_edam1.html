This is a very simple recipe, but quite popular in southern China, 
where some versions are even simpler.	13 ounces is 4 or 5 salad 
servings, but for buffet, make a lot more.

    Edamame, you'll have to simmer for about 5 minutes. In either

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Edamame</h3> &nbsp; This is fresh green soy beans. They are 
  available frozen in Asian markets and in many supermarkets. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_soyz.html"><b>Soybeans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sichuan Vegetable:</h3> &nbsp; [Szechwan Vegetable] &nbsp; 
  Traditionally, this product was sold in cans and is still available 
  that way - but check the label, you want whole, not shredded. Today 
  it is also sold in sterile vacuum pack, which is better, and you 
  can see if it's whole or not.For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_szechz.html"><b>Szechwan Vegetable / Zha 
  cai</b></a> page. If you can't get Sichuan Vegetable, you can 
  use Preserved Turnup or Preserved Mustard Greens, both seen on 
  our <a href="../ingred/cb_pickle.html"><b>Pickled & Preserved 
  Cabbages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili</h3> &nbsp; I use one Red Fresno chili, which can be 
  almost completely disarmed by removing the seed core and membranes. 
  A Red Anaheim would also work fine, with less heat and somewhat thicker 
  walls. The pattern recipe, as usual, doesn't say what kind of red 
  chili, she probably presumes you'll have no choice except Red Bell 
  Pepper. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
