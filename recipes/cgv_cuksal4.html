An interesting salad from the Bai people of western Yunnan. The soy sauce 
makes it quite different from most vinegar and oil salads.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Dry roast <b>Peanuts</b> if you don't have them already on hand. 
    See our recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted 
    Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Toast <b>Sesame Seeds</b> if you don't have them on hand. See our 
    recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>.</li>
    </ol>     
  <b><u>Make</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 20 min work)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut the ends off the <b>CUCUMBERS</b>. Smack them (presuming 
    Persians or similar) with your kitchen mallet, then turn 1/4 and 
    smack some more. They should split into thirds or quarters. If 
    some are too wide, split them lengthwise with a knife.   Cut 
    the strips into 3/4 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Cucumbers</b> in a bowl and mix them well with the 
    salt. Let them sit for 30 minutes or so. This will prevent the 
    salad from getting watery when standing.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Mix all <b>Dressing 
    items</b> in a small jar.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Cucumbers</b> very well, but don't rinse.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Peanuts</b> for Garnish.</li>
  <li>Shake the dressing up well and pour over the Cucumbers. Toss 
    to coat well.</li> 
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Sesame Seeds</b> and <b>Crushed Peanuts</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumber:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible use thin cucumbers 
  like Persian or Japanese that don't have to be peeled and seeded.
  The instructions above presume Persians 6 inches long. If all you 
  have is the standard waxed green blimps, you will have to peel and 
  seed them, then weigh them. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html"><b>Cucumbers</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; In Yunnan, Erjingtiao Chilis would 
  probably be used, but they are not much available in North America, 
  so we generally use Korean Chili Flake, which is usually not overly 
  hot - use your own best judgement for type and quantity. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean &amp; Japanese 
  Chilis</b></a> and <a href="../ingred/cp_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese 
  Chilis</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dry Roasted Peanuts</h3> &nbsp;  Used a garnish for many Chinese 
  and Southeast Asian recipes, these have a much different flavor and 
  texture than commercial roasted peanuts. See our recipe 
  <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always be on hand for 
  those cuisines. They are available already toasted in Asian markets, 
  but are better and more reliably fresh made at home. See our easy 
  recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>. 
  Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, they will 
  last for several months.</li>
