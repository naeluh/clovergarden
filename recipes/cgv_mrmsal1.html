<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was made with Shiitakes 
  (Chinese Black Mushrooms). Other Dried Mushrooms will also work, 
  with very different flavors. The Asian markets here in Los Angeles 
  have many varieties, but in most places you will be limited. Porcinis 
  would probably have to be soaked overnight. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Mushrooms &amp; Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Typical of the Southeast Asian corner of 
  Yunnan, this salad should have a definite chili bite. For most people, 
  one Thai Chili (red or green) will be plenty, but use your own best 
  judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china"><b>Vinegar &amp; Souring 
  Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This amount given is for Chili Oil as made 
  by our <a href="cis_chiloil1.html"><b>Chili Oil</b></a> recipe. If 
  using commercial Chili Oil, <u>proceed with caution</u>, as they can 
  be a lot hotter.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Vegans should note that Mushrooms are far 
  more closely related to Animals than to Plants. We don't know what 
  kind of consciousness their tangled, thread like bodies may have, but 
  some scientists think these far reaching threads are used by some 
  plants as an Internet over which to transmit warnings.</li>
