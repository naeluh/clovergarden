The Chinese use a whole lot of Chicken Stock, but their stock is very 
simple compared to some other regions.  This stock was made from a 10 
pound bag of Chicken Leg Quarters, with all the clear meat removed for 
use in other recipes. See also <a href="cic_chkstk1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs - 1-3/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Dismantle <b>CHICKEN</b>. Carefully remove all clear meat from 
    the thighs and legs, and the "oysters" from the back. Refrigerate 
    or freeze the meat. Everything else, skins, bones, fat, etc. goes 
    into the stock pot. Dismantling a 10 pound bag of Leg Quarters will 
    take 1 hour, if you work fast and efficiently.</li>
  <li>Place all off-cuts in an 8 quart pot. Cover well with plenty of 
    <b>Water</b> and bring to a rolling boil for about 3 minutes, 
    stirring it around a couple times. Pour it all out into a clean 
    sink (careful about splashing). Clean the pot. Rinse scum off all 
    the parts as you return them to the clean pot.</li>  
  <li>Smash <b>GINGER</b> moderately with your kitchen mallet. Use it 
    also to lightly crush <b>SCALLIONS</b> Toss both into the pot with 
    the Chicken.</li>
  <li>Add 16 cups water and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low and 
    keep it just bubbling for about 2-1/2 hours.</li> 
  <li>Strain the stock, discarding all solids. Defat it using your gravy 
    separator.</li>
  <li>You should end up with 10 to 12 cups, depending on the intensity 
    of your simmering. If you want, you can boil it down some to adjust 
    flavor, or for easier storage. I label the jars with a "C" with 
    underlines - one for dilute by 1/4, two for dilute by 1/3, 3 for 
    dilute 1/2 to bring to normal soup concentration. Refrigerate when 
    cool enough - see  <a href="cic_chkstk1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for details.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> This recipe is based on a 10 pound bag of Chicken 
  Leg Quarters. This will yield about 4-1/2 pounds of clear meat 
  (2-3/4 pounds Thigh Meat, 1-3/4 pounds Leg Meat) for use in other 
  recipes. There will be a few ounces over 5 pounds of off-cuts for 
  the stock.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Storing:</h3> &nbsp; If you bring the stock back to a boil after 
  de-fatting, and pour it into clean heat resistant jars (I use 4 cup 
  sauerkraut and pickle jars) while still very hot, and 
  immediately cap them tightly, it'll keep for months in the fridge. 
  For details see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock 
  / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; If you need cooked chicken in the 
  recipes you have planned, you can put large pieces of meat into the 
  pot when the stock has 40 minutes to go. Most often, I freeze the 
  meat quickly in a single layer to minimize cell damage, and so pieces  
  can be individually retrieved for recipes (see 
  <a href="cic_chkstk1x.html#gal"><b>Photo</b></a>). I then 
  bag the pieces in plastic. </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is based on patterns given in 
  Fuchsia Dunlop's books, but omitting the Pork Parts she usually 
  includes  In our very diverse culture, we don't just toss pork into 
  everything like the Chinese do. The Gods have reserved this most 
  delicious and versatile animal for their favored peoples, but it is 
  forbidden to Jews and Muslims. If you do use Pork in the stock, the 
  meat should still be edible when the stock is done, while any 
  chicken meat is pretty much exhausted.</li>
