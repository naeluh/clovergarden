This is an important item in Sichuan cuisine. it is best made at 
home because purchased chili oil is usually too hot, and it lacks 
sediment, also used in recipes. With this recipe you can use enough 
for flavor before your recipe gets too hot.

  <ol>
  <li>Cut 1/4 inch slice of <b>Ginger Root</b> and crush it moderately. 
    Mix it with <b>Chili Flake</b> and <b>Sesame Seeds</b>. in a 
    heatproof bowl or pan.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> to about 400&deg;F/200&deg;C and let it cool down 
    until 290&deg;F/143&deg;C. This temperature is quite critical.</li>
  <li>Pour the hot <b>Oil</b> over the <b>Chili mix</b>. If the 
    temperature is right, it should sizzle well, but not burn. Too cool 
    can be corrected by heating the mixture just until the chili is 
    bubbling, about 250&deg;F/120&deg;C for a minute or so. Burned chili 
    cannot be fixed. </li>
  <li>Let cool completely and store both oil and the sediment in a jar, 
    kept in a cool place away from sunlight. It should be let settle 
    for a day before use, if possible.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; My choice is Olive Pomace, which is quite neutral in 
  flavor and quite resistant to rancidity. Pure Olive Oil would work, but 
  definitely not Virgin. Avocado Oil would work, but has a somewhat buttery 
  taste. Most vegetable oils, including Canola, go rancid very quickly, 
  especially when heated, so they are not suitable for an item that may not 
  be all used immediately. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; In Sichuan, Erjingtiao Chilis would be 
  used, but they are not yet much available in North America. A fine 
  Korean flake will have about the right hotness but less flavor. Korean 
  flake can be found in any Korean market, but it does vary quite a bit 
  in hotness. If it comes out too hot, add more oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Chilis</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a> 
  pages.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Other Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; I have made this successfully using Chilis 
  Negro, which I ground myself, and which probably give a result closer to 
  Erjingtiao Chilis than the Korean Flake. I have also made it with Chili 
  Guajillo, which gave an oil of good flavor and moderate hotness. I consider 
  it quite suitable for this recipe. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a> page. Do not 
  expect any of these chilis to give you the bright red color of the 
  commercial stuff - consider that bright red color to be evidence it's 
  fake.</li>
