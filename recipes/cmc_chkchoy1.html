DEV: this needs a photo - the included photo is of pork.
A nice, simple stir fry I use when I want something good that doesn't 
take a lot of effort.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>   &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> about 1/4 inch thick, then into strips about 
    1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long, or as desired.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLION</b> fine. Mix <b>All Marinade items</b> and massage 
    into <b>Chicken</b>. Let stand for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strip green leafy part from white <b>BOK CHOY</b> stems and cut into 
    strips about 1 inch wide. Cut stems diagonally into pieces about 1/2 
    inch wide at the big end, increasing to 1 inch at the thin end. This 
    will depend a bit on the size of your bok choy. Keep leaves and stems 
    separate </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into threads. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with water to make a slurry. This amount will 
    make a loose sauce (my preference with rice), add a bit more if you 
    want it thicker.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> hot and sir in <b>Ginger mix</b> until 
    fragrant, then stir in <b>Chicken</b>. Fry stirring until until 
    Chicken has completely lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Choy Stems</b> and fry stirring about 3 minutes, then 
    stir in <b>Choy Leaves</b> until coated with oil and wilted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over 
    low heat until Bok Choy stems are crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Push all solids up the side of the wok exposing the liquid. Stir up  
    <b>Cornstarch</b> and stir it in to thicken the sauce, then stir 
    down the solids.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless boneless. I prefer 
  thigh/leg meat which has better flavor and texture than the cardboard 
  breasts sold in North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a small bok choy 
  for this, but regular supermarket bok choy will work fine, or Shanghai 
  bok choy ("baby bok choy" in the supers). Other choys such as Yu Choy 
  will also work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serrano Chili</h3> &nbsp; Chicken is a bit mild, and in my opinion 
  the recipe can use a bit of spicing up. Use your own best judgement 
  here.</li>
