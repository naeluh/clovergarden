A winter dish in Changde, made in a clay pot bubbling over a stove in the 
center of the table. The frying is messy and takes time but can be done 
a day or more ahead.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> apart and chop into small serving pieces Chinese 
    way. See <a href="cmc_chkclay1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for method, or 
    <a href="cmc_chkclay1.html#02"><b>Note-1</b></a> for alternatives.</li>  
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, break up <b>CASSIA</b> into large shards. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel the <b>GARLIC</b> but leave the cloves whole.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into 1/2 inch wide strips about 1-1/2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths, using the green part 
    only</li>
  <li>Stem <b>CHILIS</b> if needed.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In an iron wok, or better a kadhai (Indian wok), or in a deep 
    skillet (chicken fryer) heat 1 cup <b>Oil</b> to near smoking. 
    Working in three batches, fry <b>Chicken Pieces</b> stirring over 
    highest heat until they have completely lost their raw color. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain.</li>
  <li>Return drained oil to the pan and bring it up very hot. Again 
    working in three batches fry the chicken parts but this time until 
    golden brown and cooked through. Again set aside to drain.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Garlic Cloves</b> into the oil and fry stirring until just 
    starting to color. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Oil</b> from the pan, clean the pan and return it to the 
    stove with 3 T of <b>Oil</b>. Actually at this point I set the kadhai 
    aside on a spare ring stand to be dealt with later, continuing with 
    a large saut&eacute; pan.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Ginger mix</b>. Fry stirring for about 
    1 minute until fragrant, then stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> and 
    fry stirring until well distributed in the oil. Stir in <b>Chilis</b> 
    and fry stirring until they just start to darken.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Garlic</b>, then <b>Sauce Mix</b>. 
    Simmer uncovered over moderate heat, turning now and then, for about 
    15 minutes. You want it to reduce in that time to a thin sauce 
    consistency but watch that it doesn't get too dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bell Pepper</b>, then <b>Scallions</b> for just a minute 
    to cook only slightly.</li>
  <li>Just before serving, drizzle the <b>Sesame Oil</b></li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; In China a whole chicken would 
  be used, but in North America you could use about the same weight legs 
  and thighs for easier preparation. As given this dish is definitely 
  finger food, but if you want to eat it with a fork use about 3/4 the 
  weight of boneless thigh meat (breast meat is too dry and flavorless).
  </li>
<li id="02"><h3>Cassia:</h3> &nbsp; Cassia bark is what passes for 
  "Cinnamon Sticks" in North America, so you probably already have it.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Either red or green, or 
  a mix of both is fine.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; use Japones if you want the 
  recipe rather mild, Arbols or Thai if you want it hotter. For really hot 
  break Arbols or Thai into several pieces. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cutting Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese are 
  convinced meat on the bone is juicier and tastier, so they cut up a 
  whole chicken into serving pieces bones and all. This is best done with 
  a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife. If you're not a Chinese chef born 
  with a cleaver knife in your hand don't try to do this free-hand. Place 
  the sharp edge of the cleaver where you want to make the cut, then 
  whack the back side firmly with a soft faced mallet (plastic, wood or 
  hard rubber) to drive it through. Preferably do this with a single 
  blow to minimize bone splinters. See 
  <a href="cmc_chkclay1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> for 
  desired result.
  <ol>
    <li>Cut off wings and thighs in the usual way with a sharp boning 
      knife. Cut thighs and legs into 3 pieces each with the cleaver 
      knife.</li>
    <li>Use your kitchen shears to separate the back side from the breast 
      side, avoiding cutting meaty parts.</li>
    <li>Use the cleaver knife to cut both breast side and back side 
      lengthwise into right and left sides. This is best done starting 
      from the inside side of both parts.</li>
    <li>Use the cleaver knife to cut both halves of both of back and 
      breast crosswise. Cut the meaty breast into narrow slices, the 
      less meaty back into larger pieces.</li>
    <li>If your chicken has feet, do not use them in this recipe, 
      cooking time is too short.</li>
    </ol></li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; If you have a Chinese sand pot and know how 
  to manage it, you could cook in a clay pot, but here I use more 
  familiar metal pans. In the city of Changde, with the pot bubbling on 
  a stove in the middle of the table, the peppers and scallions would 
  be sprinkled on top to cook in the steam.</li>
