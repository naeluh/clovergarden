  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite size chunks about 1/2 inch thick.
    </li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> 1/2 hour or more in warm water. Wring out, 
    remove stems and cut into quarters.</li>
  <li>Thaw <b>CHESTNUTS</b> (see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/03">Note-3</a>).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> a bit less than 1/4 inch thick. Mix with 
    <b>Chestnuts</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Cut <b>SCALLION</b> 
    whites from the greens, crush lightly and mix with Ginger.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Scallion Greens</b> about 1 inch long and set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Ginger mix</b> until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Push <b>Ginger mix</b> to the side and add <b>Chicken</b>. Fry 
    tumbling now and then until very lightly colored. Be careful the 
    fond adhering to the pan doesn't get burned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chestnut mix</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b> and <b>Sauce mix</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, scraping up fond adhearing to the pan. Cover and 
    simmer for about 20 minutes or until Chicken is tender.</li>
  <li>If desired, uncover and keep at a light boil to reduce the sauce 
    to the consistency you want. It should still be fairly liquid if 
    serving with rice.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallion Greens</b> for about 1 minute, then take 
    off heat and stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, 
  boneless. Use thigh/leg meat for the best flavor and texture. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are dried 
  Shiitakes, and can be found in almost any market these days. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html">Shiitake 
  Mushroom</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chestnuts:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for cooked and 
  peeled. I strongly suggest using frozen chestnuts, found in Asian 
  markets. The chestnuts we get here in California are from China and 
  Korea, and I have tried every peeling method and trick on the Internet 
  without success.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Get them in the 
  vacuum pack bags - much superior to canned, which have to be par boiled 
  to remove the tinny taste.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Asians go wild with sugar, more sweet than 
  appropriate for Western tastes, as well as for health. I have called 
  for 1/3 the amount in the pattern recipe, and its plenty for me.</li>
