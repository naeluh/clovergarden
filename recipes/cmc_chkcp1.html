  <p>We've divided this into 3 sections for easy work flow, allowing 
    plenty time between the sections. The most tedious part, preparing 
    the Chilis, could be done days ahead.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> into 3/4 inch dice, or as close to that as 
    you can get with your chicken.</li>
  <li>Lightly smash <b>GINGER</b> and <b>SCALLION WHITE</b>. Mix all 
    <b>Marinade items</b> with the Chicken and massage together well. 
    Set aside to marinate 1/2 hour or more, tumbling a couple times.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Trim 1/2 in <b>GINGER</b> as needed and 
    slice very thin. Cut the slices into threads. Lightly Smash 
    <b>SCALLION WHITES</b>. Mix all <b>Aromatics</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice some of the <b>SCALLION GREENS</b> thin and set aside for 
    garnish.</li>
  <li>With Kitchen Shears, cut tops off of <b>CHILIS</b>. and cut into 
    1/2 to 3/4 inch lengths, shaking out as many seeds as you can.</li>
  <li>IF using traditional Pixan Broad Bean Paste, chop it fine.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>DEEP FRY</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
    <li>Remove <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Scallions</b> from the Marinade.</li>
    <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C over highest 
      heat. Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring for about 5 minutes, 
      or until just a touch of golden. Scoop out with your spider and 
      set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring <b>Oil</b> back up to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C over highest 
      heat. Stir the <b>Chicken</b> back in and fry stirring until 
      golden and crispy, about another 4 minutes - watch that it doesn't 
      get too dark. Scoop out with your spider and set aside.</li>
    <li>Pour out the <b>Oil</b> and wipe the wok with paper towels.
      </li>
    </ol> 
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In the wok, heat 3 T <b>Oil</b> over moderate flame (it can be 
    some of the deep fry oil). Stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> for about 
    30 seconds, then stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b> and stir until 
    aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> and fry stirring until aromatic and barely 
    darkening.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>, then <b>Rice Wine</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Stir until Chicken is warmed and coated with the oil. Take off heat 
    and stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Scallion Greens</b> and serve hot with plenty of 
    steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless chicken thigh meat, 
  because thigh meat is moist and flavorful compared to the cardboard 
  chicken breasts we get here. You can include squares of skin equivalent 
  to the amount from the thighs, or a little more.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid salted "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. 
  Sake is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The common Japones work very well, and 
  give a result that is just satisfying spicy by Southern California 
  standards. If you need more mild, you'll have to find Facing Heaven 
  chilis on the Internet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05"> 
  <h3>Chili Broad Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, this should 
  be Sichuan Chili Broad Bean Paste. If you just can't get it, you can 
  use a Chili Soybean Paste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_pdfavaz.html"><b>Fava Bean / Broad Bean 
  Products</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The role of the Chilis is to provide color 
  and aroma. They're too tough to eat. The pieces of Chicken are simply 
  picked out (with chopsticks in China, but a salad fork is also good) 
  leaving the Chilis on the plate. Don't worry about the amount of oil, 
  nearly all of it gets left behind with the Chilis. The pattern recipe 
  had an option to scatter 1/2 t Toasted Sesame Seeds as part of the 
  Garnish. This is fine if you have them on hand, as I always do, but 
  not worthwhile making for just this one dish.</li>
