Following a recipe from Mao era China, this is rather different from the 
Egg Fu Yung of "Chinese American" infamy. See also <a href="cmc_chkfuyu1.html#04">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>CHICKEN</b> fine, then pound to a paste in a large mortar or 
    by some other means (see <a href="cmc_chkfuyu1.html#03">Note-3</a>).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>FISH</b> fine and mix with <b>Chicken</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>WATER CHESTNUTS</b> small. Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine. 
    Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Mix all with <b>Cornstarch</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Chicken</b> </li>
  <li>Separate <b>EGGS</b>, reserving yolks for some other use. Beat 
    <b>EGG WHITES</b> until almost stiff. Fold gently into 
    <b>Chicken</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Sliver <b>SCALLIONS</b> for garnish. Cut in half lengthwise, then 
    slice diagonally into 1/2 inch slices.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or deep skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> to about 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. A few at a time drop in <b>Chicken mix</b> by 
    1 T lumps - not too large. Fry until nicely browned. These are light, 
    so the fact that they float to the surface doesn't mean they are done 
    through. If in doubt about your timing cut a large one in half and 
    inspect. Set aside to drain.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Cornstarch</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b></li>
  <li>When ready to serve: in a pot large enough for the whole recipe, 
    bring <b>Stock</b> to a simmer, Stir in <b>Cornstarch mix</b> and stir 
    over moderate heat until it thickens.</li>
  <li>Drop <b>Chicken lumps</b> into the pot with the <b>Sauce</b>. 
    Bring to a boil. Pour out into a heated serving bowl. Garnish with 
    <b>Scallions</b> and serve hot.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless boneless 
  with all excess fat removed. I prefer thigh / leg meat to the flavorless 
  breast meat we get here in North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Any medium flavor fish 
  fillet will work fine. The photo example was made with ling cod 
  (because that's that was in the freezer compartment), but Tilapia 
  will work fine too.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; You can save some time by 
  running the chicken and fish through a meat grinder (separately). You 
  still have to chop the chicken some because it will be stringy and then 
  pound it to paste. I use a big stone mortar, but a food processor may 
  work - but then you have to clean the thing and put it away.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  you could also make this as patties (as 
  North American Egg Fu Yung is made), which would cut down on frying 
  time and allow making it in a skillet. Note that much depends on the 
  <u>quality</u> of the stock you use.
