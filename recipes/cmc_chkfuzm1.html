A simple but tasty stew. I call it "China / California" because I didn't 
find an exact Chinese recipe for this, and adapted a recipe for 
<a href="cmm_pigfuzm1.html"><b>Pork Belly with Fuzzy Melon</b></a>. 
Of course, this recipe is lower in calories.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (1 hr - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> thin and dice or chop small.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Chicken</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for 1/2 hour or more.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>SHRIMP</b> well. I run to powder in a spice grinder 
    because Americans aren't accustomed to sharp pointy bits in their 
    food.</li>
  <li>Scrape the <b>FUZZY MELON</b> with the back side of your prep knife 
    to remove the very thin dark green peel. Cut lengthwise into quarters 
    and cut into bite sized wedges with alternating diagonal cuts.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into thin slivers. 
    Mix together with all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> and 1 T <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>. Fry stirring over high heat until you see 
    a little browning. Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Chicken</b> into the pan and fry stirring over high flame 
    until it has completely lost its raw color and you see a trace of 
    browning. Watch the fond that sticks to the pan, reddish is OK, but 
    if it tends to chocolate, go to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and <b>Dried Shrimp</b>. Continue 
    stirring another minute. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>, then <b>Stock</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until Fuzzy Melon is tender. This 
    can take from 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir up <b>Cornstarch slurry</b> and stir it in until it thickens 
    the stew. Adjust liquid if needed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. I use thigh 
  and leg meat which has better texture and flavor than the cardboard 
  breasts we get around here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, 
  use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. Quality varies widely. 
  My current favorite is Megachef (Thai), but it isn't as widely 
  available as Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u>, which is also very good - 
  very Chinese looking bottle, but made in Los Angeles. Yes, these are 
  more expensive, but for a reasons - much higher oyster content, 
  unleaded and no melamine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for whole tiny dried shrimp, 
  or lightly crushed if larger. Easiest way to measure is to half fill 
  a 1/4 cup measure (= 2 T).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Qua] Actually a gourd, this is the 
  immature form of the giant Ash Gourd or Winter Melon. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html">Fuzzy Melon</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Huy Fong Foods 
  (Green cap) is available nearly everywhere, and just as widely 
  respected.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork stock will work fine.</li>
