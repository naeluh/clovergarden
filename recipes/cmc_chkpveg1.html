This dish from Sichuan, featuring interesting contrasts of flavors and 
textures requires only moderate prep and cooks very quickly. Despite 
being from Sichuan, this recipe is low in chili heat (if you disarm 
the red chilis). See also <a href="cmc_chkpveg1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> into 1/4 inch dice, or as close to that as 
    you can get with your chicken.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Marinade items</b> with the Chicken and massage together 
    well. Set aside to marinate 1/2 hour or so, tumbling now and 
    then.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>RED CHILIS</b> and <b>GREEN CHILIS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Map Gas Torch</b></a> (see 
    <a href="cmc_chkpveg1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>) and wipe off skins under running 
    water. Cut both into pieces about the same size as the Chicken. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>PRESERVED VEGETABLE</b> very thoroughly to reduce salt. 
    Squeeze it out well, and chop it fairly small if needed.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    cut slices into slivers and then chop the slivers fine. Mix both 
    with Preserved Vegetable.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over high 
    flame. Stir in <b>Chicken</b>. Fry stirring over high flame until 
    it has lost its raw color. The starch will start sticking to the pan, 
    but cooking is so short it won't darken more than to a medium 
    blonde.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring until aromatic.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili Mix</b> and fry stirring until they are crisp 
    tender, about a minute.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless chicken. I 
  always use thigh and/or leg meat because it is moist and flavorful 
  compared to the cardboard chicken breasts produced in North America.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> Use a good drinkable Chinese rice 
  wine. The cooking versions are heavily salted and not that good to start 
  with. If you don't have the rice wine use a dry sherry. Sake, though 
  made from rice, is not considered a good substitute. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Fresh Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; All the ethnicities here in Southern 
  California have found the Red Fresno chili to be fine for their 
  cuisines. Two large Fresnos weigh about 1-1/2 ounces. Holland Reds 
  will also work, and Red Anaheims, though they have thicker walls. 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04"> 
  <h3>Green Fresh Chili</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Long 
  Turkish Chilis". Those are not available in California, and probably 
  not much elsewhere in North America (and probably not in Sichuan 
  either). I use Green Anaheims, the smallest ones I find in the bin.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Preserved Vegetable</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  Yibin Yacai, while admitting your chances of finding it outside 
  Sichuan are about zero. Fuchsia Dunlop says Tianjin Preserved 
  Vegetable (sold in squat ceramic jars in most Asian markets) is 
  similar, but also mentions Sichuan Vegetable as usable. For 
  details on these and other potential substitutes, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_pickle.html"><b>Pickled &amp; Preserved 
  Cabbages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Blasting Chilis</h3> &nbsp; This is NOT called for in the pattern 
  recipe, but I always do it. It gives the chilis a nicer texture, 
  and also prevents loose chili skins floating around when dishes are 
  reheated. With the <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Map Gas Torch
  </b></a> it takes just a few minutes to accomplish this improvement.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp;  Despite the unquestionable authenticity of 
  the pattern recipe, I suggest some options. In contrast to China, where 
  many dishes may be presented, I normally eat stir fries with rice and 
  nothing else. For that purpose I prefer some liquid sauce. Also, there 
  will be quite a bit of fond adhering to the pan, which would act as a 
  flavorful thickener stirred into a sauce. To this end I suggest 1/2 
  cup stock be stirred in after the preserved vegetable step and the 
  fond scraped up into the sauce. The Chinese already consider me a 
  foreign barbarian, so what's to lose?</li>
