This recipe is for unusually smooth, moist and sophisticated chicken, 
combined with the tender crunchiness of Bamboo shoots, all in a delicate, 
lightly sour sauce. For a similar but simpler recipe see 
<a href="cmc_chkvin1.html"><b>Dong'an Chicken</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into strips about 1/2 inch wide and at most 
    1/4 inch thick. Cut these strips diagonally into small lozenges - or, 
    however works with your chicken, but not thick because cooking time 
    is very short.</li> 
  <li>Tumble <b>Chicken</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Rice Wine</b>. 
    Separately, beat <b>EGG WHITES</b> and slowly beat in <b>Potato 
    Starch</b> to make a light batter. Tumble this into the <b>Chicken</b> 
    to coat evenly. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> less than 1/4 inch thick (or Celery, 
    see <a href="cmc_chkvin2.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>) and cut into small lozenges 
    similar to the Chicken.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into threads, then chop 
    the threads fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li> 
  <li> Cut green part of <b>SCALLIONS</b> into thin slices.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> to about 265&deg;F/130&deg;C - not too 
    hot. Stir up <b>Chicken mix</b> and stir into the Oil along with the 
    <b>Bamboo Shoots</b> (or Celery). Stir over moderately high heat, 
    breaking apart Chicken until it has completely lost its raw color and 
    is all separated. It should be only partially cooked at this point - 
    do not overcook. Scoop out with a Spider and set aside. to drain.
    </li>  
  <li>Pour out most of the <b>Oil</b>, leaving 3 Tablespoons in the wok.
    Heat the oil and stir in the <b>Chili Paste</b> until it is well 
    distributed and the oil is red. Then stir in the <b>Garlic Mix</b> 
    until it is aromatic.</li>
  <li>Return the <b>Chicken mix</b> to the wok. Stir it in for about 
    two minutes. Quickly stir up the <b>Sauce mix</b> and stir it into 
    the wok, stirring until it thickens.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallion Greens</b> and <b>Chinkiang Vinegar</b>. Check 
    the largest piece of Chicken, it should be just cooked through - 
    don't overcook. Take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> Weight is boneless, but can be skin-on or skinless. 
  I use Thigh and Leg meat which has better texture and flavor than 
  the cardboard breast meat we get around here, though breast does 
  slice more neatly.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots, or:</h3> &Uuml;ber expert Fuschia Dunlop reports 
  that in Sichuan the vegetable used is Winter Bamboo Shoots, but that 
  when she is home in London, she uses 5-1/4 ounces of Celery, 
  de-stringed and cut into lozenges similar to the Chicken. I used 
  vacuum packed Green Bamboo Shoots, because a vacuum pack of Winter 
  Bamboo Shoots weighed a whole pound. I did use celery leaves for the 
  garnish. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html">
  <b>Bamboo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chinkiang Vinegar:</h3> This is an unsweetened dark rice vinegar 
  (water, glutenous rice, salt). Gold Plum is a good brand that's 
  widely distributed in North America, but there are others. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Officially, this should be Sichuan 
  Pickled Chili Paste, but Huy Fong's Sambal Oelec, available almost 
  everywhere, is considered an excellent substitute. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a> 
  page.</li>
