A very nice combination of flavors with a lightly crunchy texture. 
Duck gizzards are much liked in France, but in North America they are 
available mainly in ethnic markets serving Chinese communities.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;	(1-1/4 hr - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse the <b>DUCK GIZZARDS</b> and remove any remaining fat - just 
    scrape it to the edges and cut it off. Slice the gizzards thin, 
    1/8 inch or less.</li> 
  <li>Mix together <b>All Marinade Items</b> and stir in the 
    <b>Gizzards</b>. Marinate at least an hour at room temperature or 
      overnight in the fridge.
    </li>
  <li>Thaw and shell <b>EDAMAME</b>. You need about 2/3 cup, then you can 
    eat the rest.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> very thin and cut into pieces about 1-1/2 
    inch by 1/2 inch.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Duck Gizzards</b>.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> very hot. 
    Stir in <b>Duck Gizzards</b> and fry stirring until all moisture is 
    gone and they're actually frying, but not so long as you burn the 
    fond sticking to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Edamame</b> and <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Fry stirring for 
    about 1 minute, then stir in <b>Stock</b>. Cook stirring until most 
    coating on the pan is dissolved and the sauce is thickened, 3 minutes 
    or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b> and immediately remove from heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Duck Gizzards:</h3> &nbsp; These are quite different 
  in taste and texture from chicken gizzards. See our 
  <a href="../ingred/bd_dkgizz.html">Duck Gizzard Page</a> for details.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Edamame:</h3> &nbsp; These are fresh soybeans boiled 
  in the pod. They have become popularized in North America so even 
  the supermarkets have bags of them in the frozen food cases.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; These are widely 
  available canned in various forms of whole, sliced and slivered, but 
  I prefer fresh or the new vacuum pack bags as having better flavor 
  (available in Asian markets). Bamboo shoots are always fully cooked, 
  necessary to drive off the cyanide.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In China the gizzards would most 
  likely be fried in duck fat, but in North America you'll probably have to 
  use some other oil, or render your own duck.</li>
