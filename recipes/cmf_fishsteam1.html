An entirely delectable (and easy) way to cook light or moderately flavored 
fish. Steaming fish in the serving dish is typically Chinese. Steam that 
condenses in the dish become part of the sauce.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 15 min work (not counting 
    cleaning the fish))
  <ol>
  <li>Scale and clean <b>FISH</b>. Make shallow diagonal cuts on both 
    sides, just through the skin, three or four depending on fish shape 
    and about 3/4 inch apart. Rub the Fish inside and out with 
    <b>SALT</b>.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GINGER</b> as needed and slice thin. Cut the slices into 
    thin slivers. Crush <b>SCALLIONS</b> moderately with your kitchen 
    mallet and cut into 1 inch lengths. Mix with Ginger.</li> 
  <li>Stuff <b>Fish</b> with 1/2 the <b>Ginger / Scallion mix</b>. Set it 
    out on the dish it will be steamed in, which should be 3/4 inch to 
    1 inch deep.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle fish with <b>SOY SAUCE</b>, then <b>SESAME OIL</b>. Spread 
    the rest of the <b>Ginger / Scallion mix</b> over the fish. Let 
    marinade at room temperature for 20 minutes or in the refirgerator 
    for 1 to 2 hours if you're working ahead.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Sprinkle the <b>RICE WINE</b> around the fish and place the dish in 
    the steamer (see <a href="cmf_fishsteam1x.html"><b>Photos</b></a>). 
    Make sure it's level so the sauce is well distributed. Bring the 
    water to a boil with the steamer open. <u>Important</u>: this limits 
    the amount of water that condenses into the dish. Once it's boiling 
    well, cover tightly and steam at a moderate boil for about 20 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve in the steaming dish with the sauce that has been produced 
    there, or serve on separate dishes and ladle sauce over. You can 
    remove the ginger and scallions if you wish, they are not eaten.
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Fish:</b> &nbsp; Weight given is for a Pompano, before cleaning and 
  with head on. Use your own best judgement for other fish, and whether 
  they are steamed with head on or off. Basically, they have to fit in 
  the steamer. Select a fish with little to moderate skin shrinkage for 
  most attractive results. Fillets are also steamed by this method. My 
  favorite is Pompano (photo), which has no skin shrink at all, but I've 
  also made it with a pair of individual size sea bass, golden thread 
  and others. The shown pompano was 1 pound. beyond 1-1/2 pounds you'd 
  probably need to remove the head and/or tail.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Steamer:</b> &nbsp; A wok with a low steamer grid 
  and a high domed cover is perfect for this. See 
  <a href="cmf_fishsteam1x.html"><b>Photos</b></a>.</li>
