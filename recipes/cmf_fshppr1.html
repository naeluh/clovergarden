A simple but delicious fish dish that's quick to make. The pattern recipe 
called for Salmon, but other firm flavorful fish will work. Serves three 
as a main dish with rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is de-boned and skin-off. The pattern 
  recipe called for Salmon, and Salmon was used in the photo example, but 
  other firm and flavorful fish will also work. Tuna, Amberjack, and Mackerel 
  for example. Mackerel would have to be skin-on. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> (very large 
  page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a Dry 
  Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good substitute, 
  it's beer, not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is most often made up "on the fly", 
  but made-ahead sauces are also used, see our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/cjv_blkbean1.html"><b>Black Bean Sauce</b></a>. To do it "on 
  the fly, add to the Garlic Mix about 1/2 t crushed Black Beans and an 
  extra small clove of Garlic. Add 1 t Rice Wine and 1/2 t Soy Sauce to 
  the Sauce Mix.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Use of Salmon suggests this is a North China 
  recipe and would be served with medium grain rice, but I serve it with 
  Thai Jasmine rice, as they would in China if they had it. This recipe 
  could also be served with noodles.</li>
