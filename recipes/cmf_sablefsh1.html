Sablefish has a unique texture and light flavor, which this recipe 
exploits. This fish is prepared in northern China, Korea, and as "Black 
Cod" in fancy restaurants over here.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 20 min work + 25 min clean
  and fillet Sablefish)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut skinless <b>SABLEFISH</b> fillets into the size you'd like. 
    Four pieces is probably good.</li>
  <li>Peel and grate <b>GINGER</b> fine. Place it in a cloth and wring it 
    out, keeping the juice and discarding the solids.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Ginger Juice</b>, <b>Soy Sauce</b>, and <b>Sugar</b>. 
    Mix with <b>Sablefish</b> to coat and marinate for 20 minutes at room 
    temperature, or 1 hour in the refrigerator, turning now and then.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b>, green part only, diagonally into 1-1/2 inch 
    lengths. Keep the white part for other recipes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 minutes)
  <ol>
  <li>Make your <b>Steamed Jasmine Rice</b> and keep warm.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Sablefish</b> and place on a dish, 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep 
    and large enough so the pieces don't touch. Arrange <b>Scallions</b> 
    around the fish.</li>
  <li>Set the dish in the steamer (See <a href="cmf_sablefsh1.html#03"><b>Steamer</b></a>) 
    and <a href="cmf_sablefsh1x.html#steam"><b>Photo</b></a>. Make 
    sure the dish is as level as possible. Place <b>Cool Water</b> in the 
    steamer and bring it to a boil uncovered over high heat. Once it 
    boils, cover it. The fish should be ready in about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a small sauce pan, heat <b>Oil</b>, then ladle in <b>Rice Wine</b>. 
    Let sizzle for just a few seconds and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Rice</b> on a plate. Top with <b>Fish</b> and 
    <b>Scallions</b>, then spoon <b>Rice Wine Sauce</b> over the fish and 
    serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sablefish:</h3> &nbsp; Commonly sold as "Black Cod". This weight is 
  for skinless fillets. If you start with a whole fish you'll need one 
  about 2-1/2 pounds to get a pound of fillet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_sablez.html"><b>Sablefish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sugar</h3> &nbsp; The sugar is necessary to counter a bitterness 
  from the ginger juice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; A wok with a low steamer grid and a high domed 
  cover is perfect for this, see <a href="cmf_sablefsh1x.html#steam">
  <b>Photo</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Pure Olive oil (not Virgin) works fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
