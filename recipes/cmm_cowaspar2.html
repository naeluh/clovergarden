Excellent flavor, and the asparagus is neither cooked to mush or 
overwhelmed - that's the California part. The ingredient list may look 
long but this recipe is very easy to make.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min	- 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into medallions about 1/8 inch thick by about 
    1 x 1-1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with 2 T <b>Water</b>, then mix together 
    <b>All Marinade items</b>. Massage into the <b>Beef</b>. Set aside 
    and marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Snap tough ends off <b>ASPARAGRUS</b>. Diagonally cut off the tips 
    to a length of 2 inches tip to tip and set aside. Cut the rest of the 
    stem diagonally into 2 inch pieces (tip to tip), keeping the bottom 
    pieces separate from the middle ones.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and chop 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Sauce Items</b></li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a rolling boil. Dump the bottom end pieces 
    of <b>Asparagus</b> in and cook for 1-1/2 minute. Dump the middle 
    sections in and cook another 1 minute, then dump in the tips. Cover 
    and cook over moderate heat for a <u>total time</u> of 7 to 8 minutes 
    depending on size. Take off heat and pour in enough cold water to 
    completely stop the cooking, but keep warm.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> over medium heat until the first touch of color, 
    then turn the heat up to high and stir in the <b>Beef</b>, with any 
    excess marinade. Fry stirring until all raw color is gone and exuded 
    liquid is evaporated, being careful nothing burns to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Cook stirring for a 
    few minutes until sauce thickens. I like it fairly thin, but If you 
    want it thicker, stir in just a little more cornstarch mixed with water.
    </li>
  <li>Drain <b>Asparagus</b> and gently stir in until coated with sauce and 
    well mixed with beef.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asparagus:</h3> &nbsp; Medium asparagus works 
  best here. The pre-cooking method is not Chinese but mine, and much 
  better for the asparagus. From studying recipes I'm convinced the 
  Chinese do not at all understand this "foreign vegetable". For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/li_aspara.html"><b>Asparagus Page</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck is good here, or Flap  meat or Flank Steak. 
  The weight is with all fat and membranes removed. If your beef is 
  frozen, slice before fully thawed. You'll have to fry over very high 
  heat a bit longer because you'll get a lot more liquid than with fresh 
  beef but it'll still be fine.</li>
