Beef Bitter Melon stir fry - great for folks who like Bitter Melon, but 
not so good for so-called "super tasters" who can't stand bitter.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into strips about 1/8 inch thick, 
    1/2 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long. This is easier if you chill the 
    beef in the freezer for about 30 minutes to stiffen it.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Marinade Items</b> and massage into the <b>Beef</b>. Set 
    aside and marinate for at least 30 minutes turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BITTER MELON</b> in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seed 
    mass with a spoon. Slice Diagonally about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Rinse <b>BLACK BEANS</b>, 
    crush well together with garlic.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> very 
    hot over high flame. at the first hint of smoke, stir in the 
    <b>Beef</b>. Stir fry until all raw color is gone and any exuded 
    liquid has evaporated. Remove the <b>Beef</b> and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the wok. Over moderate flame, stir in 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring until aromatic, about 1 minute. 
    Turn the flame to high and stir in the <b>Bitter Melon</b> for about 
    1 minute.</li>  
  <li>Stir the <b>Beef</b> back in, then the <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring to 
    a boil, cover and simmer for 3 minutes. Scrape as much of the fond 
    as has loosened into the sauce.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; Use the Chinese variety, the one with 
  a smooth warty skin. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat and membranes removed. Chuck or brisket work fine, but 
  cooking time is very short, so avoid tough cuts like Round.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are salted and fermented soy beans 
  sold in bags and boxes in Asian markets. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Black Bean</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was by a family of 
  Cantonese cooks. My instructions depart a bit from theirs, as our 
  home stoves cannot achieve the intense heat needed for true Cantonese 
  wok cooking. Part of their recipe was an operation to reduce the 
  bitterness of the bitter melon. Why people who want to cook bitter 
  melon keep trying to reduce its bitterness is beyond me. They're just 
  not that bitter - I seed them, slice them up, salt them lightly and 
  eat them raw as snacks. In any case, here's their method.
  <blockquote>Prepare a deep bowl of <b>Ice Water</b>. Bring plenty of 
  <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil. Stir in 1 T <b>Salt</b>. Dump the 
  <b>Bitter Melon</b> and blanch for 1 minute. Strain out and dump 
  into the <b>Ice Water</b>.</blockquote></li>
