This flavorful Beef with Choy recipe doesn't need separately cooked 
rice - it has plenty of rice right in it. Rice Ovals, popular in China 
and Korea, give this dish an unusual texture.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 
    strips about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Marinade</b> and massage it into <b>Beef</b>. Set aside to 
    marinate for 20 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BOK CHOY</b> and cut it into bite size pieces however you 
    like. For Shanghai Bok Choy stems do not need to be held separate. 
    Other choys may need the stems separated.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a boil and stir in the <b>Rice 
    Ovals</b>. Simmer until soft but still chewy. For semi-dry this will 
    be about 8 to 10 minutes, for fresh, a few minutes less. Refresh in 
    cold water to stop cooking and drain well. Tumble them very well with 
    a good dollop of oil to keep them separate - they will stick if not 
    completely coated.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Scallions</b> thin for garnish, white and green.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Bok Choy</b>. Fry stirring over moderately high flame until it 
    is crisp tender and tastes cooked. For some choys you will need to 
    give the stems a head start (see <a href="cmm_cowbokr1.html#03">Note-3</a>). Remove 
    from the pan and set aside, leaving as much oil as possible in the 
    pan.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and stir in <b>Beef</b>. Fry 
    stirring over high heat until it has completely lost its raw color 
    and any exuded liquid has evaporated. Be careful not to burn any 
    fond that adheres to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice Ovals</b> and <b>Sauce mix</b>. Fry stirring over 
    moderate heat until ovals are nicely coated. Separate any that are 
    stuck together.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bok Choy</b> and fry stirring until well coated with 
    sauce and heated through. Stir in a little water to loosen if needed, 
    or more Oyster Sauce and/or Soy Sauce if needed for more sauce or to 
    adjust flavor.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Scallions</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  trimmed away. Use a reasonably tender cut such as shoulder as 
  cooking time is short.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This is a Shanghai recipe, 
  so Shanghai Bok Choy is most appropriate - it's the green stemmed 
  choy sold in the markets as "Baby Bok Choy". For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_boksz.html">Shanghai Bok Choy</a> page. You can 
  use other forms of choy as alternatives, but but, except for Shanghai 
  bok choy and Yu Choy, give the stems a couple minutes lead over the 
  leaves in cooking. Of course, each choy has a somewhat different 
  flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia">Cabbage Greens</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Ovals:</h3> These are available in practically any market 
  serving a Chinese or Korean community. The vacuum packed semi-dry ones 
  are most convenient, since they can be stored (unlike fresh) and do 
  not require soaking (like the dried) for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html">Rice Noodles</a> page.</li>
