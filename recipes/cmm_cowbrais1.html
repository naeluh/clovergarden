From the northern city of Taiyuan, this is simply beef with a sauce. The 
flavor is quite intense, so it should be served with plenty of rice and 
a less intense side dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>BEEF</b>, chill it in the freezer until 
    quite stiff and slice across the grain 1/8 inch or thinner. Cut 
    slices 3/4 inch wide by up to 2 inches long.</li>  
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into lengths of about 1-1/2 inches. Mix all  
    <b>Marinade Items</b> and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Set aside 
    for 20 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Place the <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b> in a small heatproof bowl. 
    Pour about 1 T <b>Boiling Water</b> over them and let them steep 
    for about 5 minutes. Discard the peppercorns and keep the liquid.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> over high flame in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan. 
    When very hot stir in the <b>Star Anise</b>, then the <b>Beef</b>. 
    Fry stirring until the raw color is gone and any liquid has evaporated 
    (see <a href="cmm_cowbrais1.html#05">Note-5</a>).
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, <b>Rice Wine</b> and <b>Sesame Oil</b>. Cover 
    and cook about 1 to 2 minutes until sauce has thickened a bit.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Grated Ginger</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; These are nothing 
  like black pepper, and are now again legal in the US. See our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">Sichuan Pepper</a> page for details.
  In this recipe they aren't so important so could be skipped if necessary.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In Northern China (and nowhere 
  else in China) meat is sometimes fried in sesame oil, and the pattern 
  recipe calls for that. I seriously doubt the sesame oil they use for 
  frying is the dark flavoring kind available here, so I prefer to err 
  on the side of caution and add it as a flavoring at the end of cooking.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The stock called for in the 
  pattern recipe is made from chicken and duck, but any reasonably good 
  stock will do - we are not gourmets of the Imperial Court here.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  frying 15 seconds - but that's under high end restaurant conditions in 
  China. There's just no way our kitchen stoves can provide anywhere near 
  that much heat that well distributed.</li>
