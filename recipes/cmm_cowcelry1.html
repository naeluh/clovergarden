Pleasantly flavorful and with an attractive contrast of soft and crunchy 
textures - don't let its blackness put you off. You can control the 
chili hotness as you desire (see <a href="cmm_cowcelry1.html#02">Note-2</a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick. Slice the 
    slices into very narrow strips 1-1/2 to 2 inches long. This is easiest 
    if the beef has been put in the freezer compartment long enough to 
    become stiff but not frozen.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Set 
    aside to  marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning once or twice.
    </li>
  <li>Break stem ends from <b>CHILIS</b> and dump out any loose seeds.
    </li>
  <li>Trim <b>CELERY</b> to remove white bottoms and branches. Cut into 
    1-1/2 inch lengths and then lengthwise into very narrow strips. Slice 
    <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> similar to Celery. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    then slice into threads. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Szechuan Pepper</b> and mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> for deep fry 
    over high heat. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring, separating the 
    strips. If you beef is fresh this should be only a couple minutes, but 
    if it was frozen give it more time to boil off the water it will 
    release. Pour oil out through a strainer and let beef drain for a few 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Return 3 T of the <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Bring up fairly hot and 
    stir in <b>Chilis</b> until they become quite dark but not at all 
    burned. Stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b> for a few seconds and then stir 
    in the <b>Celery mix</b>. Fry stirring until the celery is tender 
    but still quite crisp.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Beef</b> back in until heated. Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and 
    bring up to a boil, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Just about any cut will do here, but 
  trim away all removable fat and membranes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you control the 
  hotness. Japones will make it just moderately hot, but if you want more 
  you can use de Arbols or Thai.  For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably this will be 
   Chinkiang Vinegar, a medium dark vinegar, but failing that another 
   rice vinegar will serve. For details see our 
   <a href="../ingred/sours.html">Sours</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; While this amount is about 
   half what was called for in the pattern recipe, it still makes the 
   dish too sweet for my taste - the dark soy sauce should provide 
   sweetness enough. Use your own best judgement.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Szechuan Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; This is nothing like 
   regular pepper. Recipes call for the peppercorns to be dry roasted but 
   they are already lightly roasted to make them legal for import into the 
   US, and I consider that sufficient. For details see our 
   <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">Szechuan Peppercorn</a> page.</li>
