From the salt mining region of Sichuan, this spicy beef dish is a popular 
local specialty. It is almost moderately hot by Southern California 
standards.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol> 
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>BEEF</b>, chill it in the freezer until 
    quite stiff (about an hour) and slice across the grain as thin as you 
    can. Slices should be about 3/4 by 1-1/2 inch, or however works with 
    your beef.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a boil. Plunge the <b>Beef 
    Slices</b> into boiling water over high heat, and as soon as it 
    comes back to a boil, stir, drain, rinse, drain and set aside.</li>  
  <li>Rinse <b>LETTUCE LEAVES</b> and tear into small pieces.</li>
  <li>For sauce, chop <b>GARLIC</b>, <b>GINGER</b>, <b>CHIVES</b> fine.  
    Mix and pound to a paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>Black Beans</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>For garnish: dry fry 1/2 t <b>Sichuan Pepper</b> until fragrant 
    and grind fairly fine.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan. Stir in 
    <b>Chilis</b> and 1 t <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>. Fry stirring until 
    chilis start to darken. Remove from heat, remove chilis and 
    peppercorns from the oil and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Reheat the Lard and stir in <b>Black Beans</b> for about 30 seconds, 
    then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and <b>Bean Paste</b>. Fry stirring 
    until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Chili mix</b> back in, then add <b>Water</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, stir in <b>Beef</b> and cook stirring 
    until most liquid is gone and the sauce adheres to the beef.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lettuce</b> and stir just long enough to mostly wilt it. 
    Turn off heat and transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with 
    <b>Hot Oil</b> and ground <b>Sichuan Pepper</b>. Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lettuce:</h3> &nbsp; Of course this should be A Choy, a Chinese 
  lettuce now available in Southern California, but Romaine is very 
  like it and will do fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Japones are much used in the region, 
  and will make the dish almost medium hot. If you want hotter, use 
  de Arbols or Thai chilis. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are salty fermented black soybeans 
  sold in plastic bags and cylindrical paper boxes in any market serving 
  an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garlic Chives</h3> are long flat leaf chives sold in all Asian 
  markets. They are about 10 inches long. I have used Flowering Chives 
  which are even better, but if you have neither use regular chives, 
  or about 3 scallions.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Sichuan style pastes are made from 
  fava beans, not soy beans and are fairly hot. If you don't have that, 
  the soybean based pastes can be used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary, Poland and Czech 
  Republic. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats they told us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If 
  you still don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), 
  or Avocado oil (richer flavor).</li>
