Aromatically flavored beef marinade with fresh crunchy choy. Very Chinese. 
An excellent, easy to make dinner dish to accompany rice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into bite size medallions 
    about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut slices into threads and chop very 
    fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.  Mix all <b>Marinade 
    items</b> and massage into the <b>Beef</b>. Let marinate for at least 
    30 minutes, turning once or twice (or at least 3 times as long in the 
    fridge).</li>
  <li>Tear or cut leaves from <b>BOK CHOY</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 
    inches long. Slice the stems diagonally about 1/2 inch wide and 
    keep separate.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Drain <b>Beef</b> thoroughly, retaining all marinade.</li>
  <li>Mix drained <b>Marinade</b> with <b>Cornstarch</b>. Add enough 
    <b>Water</b> to make about 1/3 cup.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> over high 
    heat. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color and all exuded liquid has evaporated. Remove beef 
    from the pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Bring up fairly hot and 
    stir in <b>Choy Stems</b>. Fry stirring about 4 minutes, then stir 
    in <b>Choy Leaves</b>. Fry stirring another 3 minutes or until the 
    stems are crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Stir up the <b>Sauce Mix</b> and cook stirring until it comes to a 
    boil and thickens. Adjust thickness as desired with a bit of 
    water or boiling off - it will thicken more as it cools. I serve 
    this as a single main dish with rice, so I keep the sauce more liquid 
    than for a Chinese style serving. </li>
  <li>Stir <b>Beef</b> back in until heated.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed.  Cooking time is very short, so a reasonably tender cut is 
  appropriate. Chuck (shoulder) is fine as long as it's clear meat 
  with very little membrane and no gristle.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Five Spice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is a Chinese 
  standard and should be made with Sichuan Peppercorns. You can make it 
  yourself per our recipe 
  <a href="cys_fivespc1.html"><b>Five Spice Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Korean flake is good here. 
  The amount given will be barely detectable - adjust to taste and how 
  close to Korea you want to get. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I have given 1/2 the amount of 
  sugar called for in the pattern recipe - but I actually leave it out 
  entirely. Asians are very big on sugar, but I consider it a "Great Evil" 
  (as do nutritionists not financed by the sweetener industry).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3> &nbsp; For this recipe I prefer the white stemmed 
  bok choy rather than the green stemmed Shanghai bok choy (called 
  "baby bok choy" in the supermarkets). Other similar choys can be 
  used, and even Chinese broccoli. The photo example was made with Short 
  Choy, new on the scene here in 2019. For details see the Asian section 
  of our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia">Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip 
  & Radish Greens</a> page.</li>
