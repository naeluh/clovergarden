OK, we know mushrooms are genetically closer to beef than to bok choy, 
but we'll let them pass as a vegetable this time. In any case, this is 
a very flavorful and easy to make stir fry.

  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into bite size medallions about 1/8 
    inch thick.</li>

    inches on a side. Slice the stems diagonally about 1/2 inch wide and 
    keep separate.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise, then crosswise about 1/8 
    inch thick.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop very fine. Mix </li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin crosswise, white and green.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat removed.  Cooking time is very short, so a reasonably tender 
  cut is appropriate. Shoulder is fine as long as it's clear meat with very 
  little membrane and no gristle.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Us a good drinkable Chinese 
  rice wine, not those horrid salted "cooking" grades. If you don't have 
  Chinese rice wine, use a Dry Sherry. Sake, though also made from rice, 
  is not considered an acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3>  &nbsp; For this recipe I prefer the 
  white stemmed bok choy rather than the green stemmed Shanghai bok choy 
  (called "baby bok choy" in the supermarkets). The photo serving was made 
  with the regular large white bok choy. I prefer smaller varieties with 
  more greens, but those are not available in all regions. Other choys 
  can be used, and even Chinese Broccoli. For details see the Asian 
  section of our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia">Cabbage, 
  Mustard, Turnip & Radish Greens</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Onion:</h3> &nbsp; This may be an adaption. 
  Many Chinese will not use regular onions which are considered "foreign", 
  a Chinese synonym for "inferior" (they came from India 2000 years ago). 
  They would use all scallions, but they have scallions much larger than 
  ours so it's not that much more effort.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; I have made this with regular 
  white mushrooms, but today small King Oyster mushrooms are widely 
  available, at least here in Southern California, and they would be 
  preferable, and likely used in China. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Soy Sauce</h3> &nbsp; For the sauce, the pattern 
  recipe calls for dark soy sauce. I prefer the taste and color of regular 
  light soy  sauce so that's what I use - or you could use a mix of the 
  two. Incidentally, "light" and "lite" are not any more the same thing 
  in soy sauce than they are in beer.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sugar</h3> &nbsp; I have given 1/3 the amount of sugar called for 
  in the pattern recipe, as that much would be way too sweet - but 
  I actually leave it out entirely. Asians are very big on sugar, but I 
  consider it a "Great Evil" (as do many nutritionists).</li>
