Beef and celery with chilis and Sichuan peppercorns. Not so fiery by Thai 
standards but pretty hot for Chinese. Also excellent as a cold beef 
salad - drain off excess oil before chilling.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>BEEF</b>, chill it in the freezer until 
    quite stiff (about an hour) and slice across the grain as thin as you 
    can. Slices should be about 1 by 1-1/2 inch, or however works with 
    your beef.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a boil. Plunge the <b>Beef 
    Slices</b> into boiling water over high heat, and as soon as it 
    comes back to a boil, stir, drain, rinse, drain and set aside.</li> 
  <li>Trim white bottoms from <b>CELERY STALKS</b>, then run a vegetable 
    peeler down the edges to remove the outermost fibers. Cut into 2-1/2 
    inch lengths, then lengthwise into sticks about 3/8 inch wide. Lightly 
    crush <b>Scallions</b> and cut into 2-1/2 inch lengths (white and 
    green). Mix with celery and sprinkle with 1/4 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Remove caps and stems from <b>CHILIS</b> and break them in half, 
    Shake out and discard as many seeds as will come out and mix with 
    <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>. Dry roast in a skillet until Chilis 
    darken moderately, but do not burn. Cool and grind medium in your 
    spice grinder.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Potato Starch</b> with <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Lard</b> quite hot (360&deg;F/180&deg;C) and stir in 
    <b>Celery Mix</b>. Fry stirring until crisp tender. Remove from oil, 
    drain and put in your serving bowl. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Add another 1 T <b>Lard</b> to the pan, bring it up hot, turn 
    heat to medium and stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b>, frying until 
    fragrant (about 30 seconds). Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Soy Sauce</b> 
    and bring to a boil over high flame.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Potato Starch mix</b> into the <b>Beef</b> and mix well to 
    coat. Scatter <b>Beef</b> into the stock and leave it undisturbed 
    until the stock comes back to a boil (so the starch gels on the 
    beef), then separate the beef slices. Simmer for a few minutes until 
    beef is cooked through.</li>
  <li>Remove the <b>Beef</b> to the serving bowl with the celery in it. 
    Sprinkle <b>Chili mix</b> over the beef.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, in a small pan bring 2 T <b>Oil</b>  over a high flame 
    until you see the first wisps of smoke. Pour the hot oil over the 
    <b>Beef</b> and serve immediately. For a dramatic sizzle effect you 
    can do the pouring at the table.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with all excess fat 
  removed. The pattern recipe calls for flank steak, but any reasonably 
  tender cut will work fine - I use Chuck.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, dry:</h3> &nbsp; Japones are commonly used in the region, 
  but for hotter you can use Thai or de Arbols. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potato Starch:</h3> &nbsp; If you use cornstarch use 
  about 1/3 more.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary, Poland and Czech 
  Republic. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats they urged us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If 
  you still don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), 
  or Avocado oil (richer flavor).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Sichuan style pastes 
  are made from fava beans, not soy beans and are fairly hot. Other Chili 
  Bean Pastes can be used without seriously damaging the recipe.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; If you wish to serve this dish as a cold 
  salad, make as per the recipe, but drain off excess oil be for 
  chilling.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese name translates simply to "Beef 
  Boiled in Water". Folks in Sichuan say visitors often order this hoping 
  for something that's not chili hot.</li>
