Beef and Fuzzy Melon is more commonly a soup, but it also works very 
well as a meaty stir fry. Fuzzy Melon is the immature stage of a gourd 
very closely related to the Winter Melon.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into strips about 1/8 inch thick 
    and about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Let 
    stand for at least 20 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Peel the <b>FUZZY MELON</b> with your vegetable peeler, taking as 
    little as possible. Cut lengthwise in quarters, then crosswise about 
    3/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b>, white and light green parts, 
    thin on a diagonal. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Slice dark green <b>Scallion tops</b> about 1/4 inch wide and 
    set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> stirring until garlic threatens to color, then stir 
    in <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until beef has lost its raw color and 
    is frying well, being careful the fond that sticks to the pan does 
    not burn, because it is the thickener for the sauce.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Fuzzy Mellon</b> and fry stirring until coated with 
    oil. Stir in <b>Scallion tops</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered 
    over moderately low heat, tumbling now and then, until Fuzzy Melon 
    is tender (about 15 minutes). The seed mass should look somewhat 
    translucent, but not start to fall apart. During this time scrape 
    up the fond to incorporate it into the sauce. Stir in more 
    stock if needed for the desired consistency. I serve this as a single 
    main dish with rice, so I keep the sauce more liquid than for a 
    Chinese style serving.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b> until well distributed and turn off heat.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Use a reasonably tender cut like 
  chuck (shoulder).  Weight is boneless, with all excess fat and 
  membranes cut away.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; Mo Qua in Chinese, this 
  is not actually a melon, it's a gourd. It is the immature stage of 
  a gourd closely related to the Winter Melon (Ash Gourd). It is quite 
  easily available in Asian markets, at least here in Los Angeles.
