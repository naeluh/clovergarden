Beef and Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli) is a common combination in southeastern 
China and farther south. It most often includes oyster sauce which counters 
the very slight bitterness of the broccoli.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into strips about 1/8 inch thick 
    and about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Let 
    stand for at least 20 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Strip leaves and tender tops from <b>GAI LAN</b>. Cut leaves into 
    fairly large pieces. Split large stems in half lengthwise and cut all 
    diagonally (including leaf stems) to lengths of about 1-1/2 inches. 
    Keep leaves and stems separate.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b>, white and light green parts, thin 
    on a diagonal. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Slice dark green <b>Scallion tops</b> about 1/4 inch wide and 
    set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> stirring until garlic threatens to color, then stir 
    in <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until beef has lost its raw color, being 
    careful the fond that sticks to the pan does not burn, because it is 
    the thickener for the dish.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Gai Lan Stems</b> and fry stirring for about 3 
    minutes, then stir in <b>Gai Lan Leaves</b> and <b>Scallion tops</b>. 
    Fry stirring until coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered over 
    moderately low heat just until stems are crisp tender (about 7 minutes). 
    The largest pieces should still have decent crunch. During this time 
    scrape up the fond to incorporate it into the sauce. Stir in more 
    stock if needed for the desired consistency. Since I serve this as a 
    single main dish with rice, I keep the sauce more liquid than for a 
    Chinese style serving.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b> until well distributed and turn off heat.
  </li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Use a reasonably tender cut like 
  chuck (shoulder).  Weight is with all excess fat and membranes cut away.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Gai Lan:</h3> &nbsp; This green looks much like 
  Rapini, but in an odd reversal it's actually broccoli, while Rapini is 
  turnip greens. Most other Asian "cabbages" are actually turnip greens.  
  For details see our
