A delicious combination, with sauce distributed by the bean threads. A 
little more complex than many stir fries, but worth it. I definitely 
prefer the flavor and texture of green beans to long beans in this dish 
(see <a href="cmm_cowgbean1.html#03">Note-3</a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick. Cut slices 
    into narrow strips between 1/8 and 1/4 inch wide. This is easier if 
    beef is chilled stiff in the freezer for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop very fine. Mix all 
    <b>Marinade items</b> (I usually leave out the sugar) and massage 
    into <b>Beef</b>. Set aside to marinate for at least 20 minutes, 
    turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in warm water for about 1/2 hour, drain and 
    set aside.</li>
  <li>Tip and tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> and cut into 2 inch lengths. 
    Parboil in boiling water until just tender, refresh in cold running 
    water and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; ()
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> 
    very hot over high heat. At the first faint wisp of smoke stir in the 
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until all raw color is gone and exuded 
    liquid has evaporated. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and 
    keep warm.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Heat and stir in <b>Green Beans</b>, 
    sprinkling with the <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring over high heat for about 
    1-1/2 minutes, then stir in 1/4 c <b>Stock</b> and cook stirring 
    another 1 minute. Remove the beans from the pan with a slotted spoon 
    and mix with the beef.</li>
  <li>Stir another 1/4 c <b>Stock</b> into the pan, then the <b>Bean 
    Threads</b>. Cook stirring for about 2 minutes until heated through, 
    then scoop them out with a slotted spoon and arrange them on the 
    serving plate. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Return the <b>Beef mix</b> to the pan and cook stirring on high heat 
    for about 15 seconds, then sprinkle the <b>Rice Wine</b> over. Toss 
    for a few seconds to blend flavors.</li>
  <li>Arrange the <b>Beef mix</b> and any remaining sauce on top of the 
    <b>Bean Threads</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat and membranes removed. Chuck or brisket work fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beans Thread Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; I use medium size 
  bean threads rather than the thinnest ones. Soak in warm water for at 
  least 1/2 hour (or 1/4 hour for the thinnest kind). Don't confuse these 
  with similar looking rice sticks - totally different. The bean threads 
  will be twice the weight after soaking.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Which to use, green beans or 
  long beans? Long beans are native to Asia and are much used in southern 
  China and Southeast Asia. Green Beans are native to the Americas and 
  introduced into China by Europeans. On the other hand, long beans are 
  tropical and subtropical so probably were not grown in much of China. 
  Green beans are now widely grown there and have been adopted into 
  the cuisine. I have other recipes for beef and long beans so I'm using 
  green beans here, and prefer them for this recipe..</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our
