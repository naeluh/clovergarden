A dish presenting intersting contrasts in flvor and texture. I call this 
"China California" because I couldn't verify the exact ethnicity of the 
pattern recipe, though the ingredients and methods were Chinese enough.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into strips about 1/8 inch thick 
    and about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Let 
    stand for at least 20 minutes. Note: if you want a thick Chinese 
    Restaurant style sauce, use 1-1/2 T of Cornstarch.</li> 
  <li>Tear <b>GAI CHOY</b> leaves into smallish shreds. Slice 
    <b>Stems</b> depending on thickness. Keep separate.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> as desired (depends on type and size - thick 
    for regular White mushrooms, thinner for King Trumpets). Mix with Gai 
    Choy Stems.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> until Garlic threatens to color, then stir 
    in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring over high heat as long as you can 
    without the fond adhering to the pan getting too dark (it should 
    be a bit reddish still) as it's the thickener for the sauce.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Gai Choy Stem mix</b>. Fry stirring for about 2 minutes, 
    then stir in <b>Leaves</b> until well coated with oil and somewhat 
    wilted.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered 
    over low heat until Gai Choy Stems are crisp tender (about 7 
    minutes, depending on size). Scrape up the fond stuck to the pan 
    to thicken and flavor the sauce. Stir in more stock if needed 
    (probably not) for the desired consistency.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Use a reasonably tender cut like 
  chuck (shoulder) because cooking time is short.  Weight is with all 
  excess fat and membranes cut away.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Small Gai Choy:</h3> &nbsp; These Chinese mustard greens are quite 
  different from Western mustard greens, more tender with a subdued 
  flavor, but they still go well with beef. Large Gai Choy is a bit too 
  strong. Don't confuse this with Gai Lan, which is broccoli. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; I prefer King Oyster 
  mushrooms which can be sliced in various ways and remain quite firm in 
  cooking. White mushrooms could be used with some change in flavor.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous 
  Hui Fong (Rooster brand) Chili Garlic Sauce will work just fine here.
