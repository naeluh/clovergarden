This is not a recipe you want to do. It is geared to street restaurants 
in China, with huge iron woks over blazing hot fires, and no air polution 
regulations. The only thing "quick" about it is the frying time for 
individual strands of beef. 
</td><td></td></tr></table>
It looks very simple but it's more than a little tedious, both for 
cutting the beef into threads and frying it a few threads at a time. It 
uses an incredible amount of corn starch, and lots of oil which is not 
useful for any purpose once this recipe is done. Your wok is exposed to 
hot sizzling oil so long it turns to varnish around the edges and you'll 
have to use oven cleaner to get it clean again.

<p>Of course a Beijing street vendor would just put the wok on the hot 
fire and burn the varnish off with spectacular leaping flames and lots of 
smoke, but that's not a good idea in your kitchen. This recipe also uses 
half a roll of paper towels to drain the beef (they burn real nice in the 
fireplace), and clean-up effort is significant. The results are filling 
(and fattening), but the beef is still tough, chewy and flavorless.  
You'd need dips and sauces to make it worth eating. Could I come up with 
a method that works better? I probably could, but the results aren't 
worth the bother. If you want something a bit like this that works see

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>BEEF</b> and put it in the freezer compartment 
    for about 1/2 hour to get stiff. Slice very thin with the grain and 
    then into long thin matchsticks, again with the grain.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Marinade Items</b> and mix with the beef.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Seasoning Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> in half lengthwise, then cut diagonally into 
    pieces about 1/2 inch wide. Measure is lightly packed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves medium for garnish.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Pour about 1/4 cup cornstarch onto a plate for dredging the beef 
    strips. You'll be adding more as you go along.</li>
  <li>In a wok heat <b>Oil</b> for deep fry (see <a href="cmm_cowqfry1.html#04">Note-4</a>) 
    to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. You'll need the oil about 3 inches deep in the 
    center so you can keep the beef threads separated.</li>
  <li>A small batch at a time, dredge the <b>Beef Strips</b> in the 
    cornstarch, shake off the excess and fry the strips, keeping them 
    separated, until they are crisp and curly. Remove and drain on paper 
    towels. Repeat until all are done.</li>
  <li>Pour out the deep fry oil.</li>
  <li>Clean the wok, heat 2 T oil over moderate heat. Fry the <b>Garlic</b> 
    for a few seconds, then stir in the <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring for about 
    1/2 minute. Turn the heat to high and pour the <b>Seasoning Mix</b> over. 
    Toss just a few times, then turn off the heat, sprinkle in the 
    <b>Scallions</b> and toss a few more times.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with the <b>Sichuan Pepper</b> and <b>Cilantro</b>. 
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Flank steak is recommended because its 
  grain is easy to follow and it's fairly thin.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; This is nothing 
  like black pepper. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">Sichuan Pepper</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable oil, 
  (Pure Olive, Olive Pomace, Tallow) - it's going to be at high 
  temperature for quite a while. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html">Cooking Oils</a> page.</li>
