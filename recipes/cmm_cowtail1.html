  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>OXTAILS</b> as needed.
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> less than 1/8 inch thick. Put <b>Oxtails</b> 
    and all <b>Broth Items</b> in a coverable pot. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer until meat pulls very easily from the bones - generally about 
    2-1/2 hours. Add water as required to keep the oxtails barely 
    covered.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Oxtails</b> from the liquid and pull all the meat from the 
    bones. Discard bones.</li>
  <li>De-fat <b>Broth</b> (easiest to do with your gravy separator). 
    Wash the pot and return <b>Broth</b> and <b>Meat</b> to the pot.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>POTATOES</b> and <b>CARROTS</b> into bite size chunks, and 
    <b>CHILI</b> smaller (if used). Add to the pot with enough water to 
    just cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until Potatoes are just done.
    </li>
  <li>Dice <b>Celery</b> small and mix into the stew. Continue to simmer 
    another 10 minutes and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ox Tails:</h3> In Southern California these are 
  almost always sold cut into individual joints. In some regions they may 
  be sawed up and you will need to wash away any bone chips. Ox tails 
  make a stew with much more body than plain beef does.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush if 
  cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This wasn't mentioned in the pattern recipe, 
  but here in Southern California, and also I expect in Sichuan and 
  Hunan, a soup or stew without some Chili just seems wrong. I would 
  use a Red Fresno, or a green Serrano, depending on how hot I want. 
  Just chop it coarsly and add with the Carrot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
