An excellent recipe for all who enjoy firm gelatinous textures, with the 
pork providing an interesting textural contrast. Easy to make, it's 
intensely flavorful and chili hot or not depending on the bean paste 
you use.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Tendon:</h3> &nbsp; These are popular in Asian 
  communities and available in Asian markets that have a good meat section, 
  and in some other ethnic markets. They are usually packed in foam trays 
  holding about 1 pound. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tendonz.html">Beef Tendon</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Broad Bean Paste:</h3> - This is a specialty of 
  Sichuan, China, where fava beans are used instead of soy beans. It comes 
  in two varieties, Regular and Hot. I use Hot, which makes this recipe 
  moderately hot by Southern California standards - use your own best 
  judgement. If you can't get this, use similar soy bean pastes - different 
  but serviceable.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> - Either chicken or pork stock is good for this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
