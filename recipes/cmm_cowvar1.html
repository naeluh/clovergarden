This is from the Muslim community in Northern China, so includes no 
pork. This is a great recipe for buffets, because it can be all made well 
ahead, and guests can pick pieces as they wish.

Don't take the 
amounts of the meats too strictly, considerable weight variations (mostly 
higher) are allowed. For details on the cuts of Beef, see our

  <b><u>Make</u></b>   &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 hrs + overnight)
  <ol>
  <li>Place all <b>MEATS</b> (whole) in an 8 quart pot and fill it to 
    near the top with water. Bring it up to a full boil for about 4 
    minutes. I usually skim as it comes to a boil to reduce the pile of 
    sludge. Pour it all out into a clean sink. Wash the pot and rinse 
    the meats well, returning them to the pot.</li>
  <li>Add all <b>Flavoring items</b> to the pot and <b>Water</b> to 
    cover meats well. Bring to a boil and set to simmer for about 2 
    hours.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Beef Shank</b>. Leave the Tendons in. If 
    <b>Honeycomb Tripe</b> it can also come out, but blanket tripe 
    should stay in a little longer. If using <b>Lamb Heart</b> you 
    can pull it out now. If <b>Beef Heart</b> it'll need to stay 
    until the Tendons are pulled. Set pulled meats aside to cool. 
    Bring back to a boil and simmer another 45 minutes or until 
    tendons are tender enough. If any other meats have been left 
    in, pull them when they are tender enough.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Tendons</b> and add to the other meats. Place 
    cooled meats in the fridge and let chill overnight for easy slicing.
    </li>
  <li> Strain the <b>Broth</b> and reduce it at a medium boil until 
    the consistency you want, stew or sauce. Though there's not much 
    fat, I de-fat the broth using my gravy separator before boiling it 
    down. This probably would not be done in China. Cool and refrigerate. 
    If you've boiled it down to 1/4 or so, it will jell very stiff 
    overnight, so should not be poured in with the meats.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Meats</b> as you like. The meat can be eaten cold, at 
    room temperature, steamed, or heated with some of the sauce and 
    served with rice. They can be served all together as I do, or 
    separately to order, as often done in Chinese restaurants. Shaobing 
    rolls, split and stuffed with tender shank is a popular breakfast 
    there. For buffet service, set the meat out in a shallow warming 
    pan with a fair amount of broth.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Shank:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless 
  with all excess fat removed. Cooking time is long, so a tough cut 
  with lots of connective tissue is needed. Some Asian markets sell 
  whole shanks, which you bone yourself. This is better for slicing, 
  because the pieces are long, but regular cross cut center shanks 
  work well enough if fairly thick.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Tendons:</h3> &nbsp; This ingredient can 
  commonly be found in markets serving a Chinese or Philippine community. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tendonz.html"><b>Beef 
  Tendons</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for Honeycomb Tripe, 
  but Blanket Tripe can also be used - but not Book Tripe. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beef Heart:</h3>  &nbsp; Weight is after removal of fat and 
  plumbing. For the photo example I used Lamb Hearts which were more 
  available, but they have more fat and need more trimming.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  now again legal in the US so long as they are lightly toasted. These 
  are nothing at all like black pepper. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sugar</h3> &nbsp; I have given 1/2 the amount of sugar called for 
  in the pattern recipe, and it's plenty. Asians are very big on sugar, 
  but I consider it a "Great Evil" (as do many nutritionists).</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tangerine Peel:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Tangerine Peel is a common 
  ingredient in China. I dry my own. it can get very dark, almost black, 
  with age, which is when it is considered best.</li>
<li id="08"><h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Us a good drinkable Chinese 
  rice wine, not those horrid salted "cooking" grades. If you don't have 
  Chinese rice wine, use a Dry Sherry. Sake, though also made from rice, 
  is not considered an acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Soy Eggs</h3> &nbsp; In a Chinese restaurant environment where 
  this meat recipe is made continuously, the Eggs would be made in the 
  sauce from the meats, but, since in my environment the sauce won't be 
  available in time, I make them a day or two ahead by our recipe 
  <a href="cad_eggsoy1.html"><b>Soy Eggs</b></a> (with the optional 
  ingredients).</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Pressed Tofu</h3> &nbsp; [Stew Bean Curd] &nbsp; 
  These stiff blocks can be found on the lightly refrigerated shelves 
  of markets serving a Chinese community. I use the lighter non-baked 
  version, but the baked could also be used. Cut into 4 slices per block 
  and prepare the same way as the Soy Eggs, but you'll need more of the 
  broth. An extra day for the flavors to penetrate would be good. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#press">
