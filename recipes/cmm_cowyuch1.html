  <b><u>Do Aheaed</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>If using, and not on hand, dry roast peanuts (see <a href="cmm_cowyuch1.html#05">
  <b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr - 20 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Dry Roast <b>PEANUTS</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 
    strips about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Marinade</b> and <b>Sauce</b>. They are very similar, so 
    easiest to make them at the same time. Crush 4 cl <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    chop fine. Slice 1 in <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Mix 
    together and divide into two equal amounts. Mix together all 
    <b>Marinade items</b> and <b>Sauce items</b> (keeping them separate, 
    of course)</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Beef</b>. Set aside to marinate 
    for an hour or so.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>YU CHOY</b> and cut it whichever way you like. For Yu Choy 
    stems do not need to be held separate unless they are quite large but 
    I usually do anyway. Other choys may need the stems separated.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring over high flame until it has completely lost 
    its raw color and all exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Yu Choy Stems</b> (if separate) and fry stirring about 
    2 minutes, then stir in <b>Leaves</b> until wilted coated with oil.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Simmer covered, 
    turning now and then until Yu Choy stems are crisp tender, about 
    4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir up the <b>Cornstarch mix</b> and stir into the pan until well 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Peanuts</b> and with plenty of 
    steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  trimmed away. Use a reasonably tender cut such as shoulder as cooking 
  time is short.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use 
  a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yu Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This is an edible version of the plant that 
  produces the seeds canola oil is processed from. It is now widely 
  grown in North America and readily available in most markets serving 
  an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_yuchz.html"><b>Yu Choy</b></a> page. You can use 
  other forms of choy as alternatives, but but in most cases give the 
  stems more of a lead over the leaves   in cooking. The flavor will 
  be a bit different and in most cases less sweet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> The ubiquitous Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce 
  (in the jar, not the squeeze bottle) will do just fine - and since it's 
  made in Irwindale, California you can be pretty sure it's unleaded and 
  contains no melamine. 1 T is pretty mild. 2 T decently spicy by 
  Southern California standards.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Peanuts:</h3></a> &nbsp; Dry roasted raw peanuts are actually 
  quite different from commercially roasted peanuts. For details see our 
  recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>
