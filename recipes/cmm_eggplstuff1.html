A delicately flavored stuffed eggplant that can be served warm or cold, 
usable as a main dish or side dish. 
It's easy to make and takes little attention while cooking (just don't 
let the steamer run out of water).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut off the stem end of <b>EGGPLANT</b> at a point where the 
    diameter is about 3-1/2 inches. Keep the stem end. Take a small knife 
    and cut a ring around the top end leaving about 3/4 inch all around. 
    Hollow out the eggplant leaving about 3/4 inch walls throughout (see 
    <a href="cmm_eggplstuff1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>). A 
    sharp     butter curler is the perfect tool for this job. Put the 
    scooped out pieces in a bowl with water acidulated with some citric 
    acid or lemon juice and a little salt to keep it from browning. You 
    may need some for this recipe and the rest can be used for something 
    else (see <a href="cmm_eggplstuff1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Rinse out the eggplant 
    shell with the acidulated water to keep it from browning too.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in hot water for about 30 minutes. Squeeze 
    out, stem, and slice into very thin strips, then slice crosswise 
    into tiny bits.</li>    
  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> quite small. Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> small. 
    Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, then chop fine.</li> 
  <li>Thoroughly mix all <b>Stuffing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Stuff the <b>Eggplant</b> with the <b>Pork Mixture</b>. If it isn't 
    completely full (packed medium) pour it out and mix with some of the 
    scooped out eggplant chopped small. Re-attach the stem end using 
    toothpicks.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Place <b>Eggplant</b> on a heatproof plate and steam tightly covered 
    over boiling water until the center reaches at least 
    165&deg;F/73&deg;C. This will take between 45 minutes and an hour, 
    depending on size of eggplant and efficiency of your steamer.</li>
  <li>Slice the <b>Eggplant</b> crosswise about 1 inch thick and serve.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Eggplant flesh</h3> &nbsp; I admit I didn't think 
  of something to use the scooped out eggplant for - I just ate it all 
  right out of the water bowl while cooking and writing up this recipe.</li>
