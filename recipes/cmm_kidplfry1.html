A simple meat dish with plenty of tasty sauce, making it a good match 
for steamed Jasmine rice. Pork and Lamb kidneys do not have so strong 
a flavor as beef kidneys.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>KIDNEYS</b> in cold water for 1 hour. Drain, slice into 
    left and right halves. Cut away the white fat and plumbing. Place 
    halves cut side down and cut diagonally into three or four pieces 
    depending on size. Soak in fresh cold water another 20 minutes, 
    then drain thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GINGER</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine, white only. Mix all <b>SAUCE 
    items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok or saut&eacute; pan heat <b>LARD</b> very hot. Stir in 
    <b>Ginger</b> and fry stirring for a few seconds. Stir in the 
    <b>Kidneys</b> over high heat until just done. They should still be 
    pink inside but there should be no free blood when pierced. Do not 
    overcook or they will toughen. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li> 
  <li>Stir the <b>Sauce mix</b> into the pan and bring to a boil. Simmer 
    stirring until it thickens.</li>
  <li>Stir the <b>Kidneys</b> back in and fry stirring until they are well 
    coated with sauce.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of rice and a vegetable side dish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; Pork kidneys or Lamb kidneys 
  are suitable. Beef kidneys have a very different flavor. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_kidneyz.html"><b>Pork Kidneys</b></a> 
  and <a href="../ingred/as_kidneyz.html"><b>Lamb Kidneys</b></a> 
  pages.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary, Poland and Czech 
  Republic. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats they urged us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If 
  you still don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), 
  or Avocado oil (richer flavor).</li>
