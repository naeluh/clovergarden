  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>TOFU</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes. Place in a heatproof 
    bowl or pan and sprinkle the salt over. Boil up plenty of 
    <b>Water</b>, and pour over Tofu. Let steep until needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GROUND BEEF</b> (or <b>PORK</b>) to make sure it will 
    separate well.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GARLIC SCAPES</b> (or substitute) into 3/4 inch sections. 
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. 
    Cut the slices into threads and the threads crosswise fine. Mix with 
    Garlic.</li>
  <li>Lightly crush <b>Black Beans</b>.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Chili Flake</b> if not already on hand.</li>
  <li>IF using <b>Traditional Chili Bean Paste</b>, chop it well to 
    prepare for use. Most jarred versions are ready to go.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
    <ol start="10">
  <li>In a wok, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> very hot. Stir in <b>Beef</b> or 
    <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring, breaking up any lumps, until fully 
    cooked, but not browned. Remove and set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Add 3 T <b>Oil</b> and heat over <u>moderate</u> flame. Stir in 
    <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> and fry stirring just until aromatic and 
    the oil is evenly colored.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Black Beans</b> and <b>Chili Flake</b> and fry stirring 
    about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> for about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Gently remove <b>Tofu</b> from water with a slotted turner and add 
    to the pan.</li> 
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Beef</b> or <b>Pork</b> over the Tofu, then add 
    <b>Broth</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Garlic Scapes</b> (if using - 
    hold Scallions for later). </li>
  <li>Carefully tumble the <b>Tofu</b> down into the sauce while 
    scraping up any fond adhering to the pan. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    just a few minutes. </li>
  <li>If using <b>Scallions</b>, they go in now.</li>
  <li>Stir up <b>Cornstarch slurry</b> and gently stir 1/3 of it into 
    the pan, then stir in the second 1/3 and give it time to thicken. 
    Only add more if needed to have a sauce that clings to the Tofu.</li>
  <li>Spoon into a serving bowl and sprinkle with ground <b>Sichuan 
    Peppercorns</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of <b>Steamed Jasmine Rice</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Tofu</h3> &nbsp; Firm Tofu is easiest for this recipe, but Medium 
  can be used with care. Don't use Extra Firm, the texture won't be 
  right. Here in Southern California, 16 oz (510 gm) and 10 oz (283 gm) 
  packages are common, and so are other sizes. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu / Bean Curd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef / Pork, Ground:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Beef is used, but 
  today, many Chinese chefs use Pork, even in Sichuan.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Garlic Scape</h3> &nbsp; [Flowering Chives] &nbsp; This is the 
  flowering stalk of a Garlic Chive plant. Scapes are popular in Asia, 
  but here in North America are available only in well stocked Asian 
  produce markets. Most recipes suggest using two medium Scallions, if 
  you can't use Scapes. In the photo example I used 1 ounce of Asian 
  Garlic Chives, the stemy 2/3 stirred in as if Scapes, some of the 
  leafy part used as garnish. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_chive.html"><b>Chives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; In Asian recipes this means salt fermented 
  Black Soy Beans, not Mexican black beans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black Beans</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Flake</h3> &nbsp; This is where you really control how hot 
  your recipe will be - you have to use your own best judgement here, 
  but don't wimp out!  I confess, the photo example used a single 
  teaspoon of flake, but it was freshly ground from 4 Seven Star chilis, 
  the hottest chili grown in China. Perfecto! For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Chilis</b></a> page.
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili Broad Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; [Doubanjiang] &nbsp; In 
  Sichuan, Broad Beans (Favas) are used instead of Soy Beans. If you 
  just can't get this product, a Chili Bean Paste from Soy Beans will 
  do. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_pdfavaz.html"><b>Fava 
  Bean / Broad Bean Products</b></a> page. The photo example was made 
  with the Traditional version.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as "Pock-marked Old Woman's Tofu", 
  it is named for the street vendor who made it famous, Chen mapo (old 
  mother Chen). This recipe can be made vegetarian by skipping the meat 
  and using a vegetable stock, but will lose some flavor and texture. 
  If you need to make it in advance, definitely use firm tofu, and 
  carefully reheat in a wok before sprinkling with Sichuan Pepper.
