<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; This is simply bacon that has not been 
  cured and smoked, and is sold in whole sides, blocks, or sliced much 
  thicker than bacon, usually used with the skin on. It is easily 
  available in markets serving an East or Southeast Asian, Latin or 
  Central European community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html"><b>Pork Belly</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cauliflower:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for florets only, as yield 
  is difficult to predict due to varying amount of stems.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Anaheim:</h3> &nbsp; A red Bell Pepper could be used instead 
  if you don't have Red Anaheims.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Pork or Chicken stock will work fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I have made some modifications to the 
  pattern recipe, published by a lady from Hunan, China, now living in 
  New York. I skinned the bell pepper for better texture, especially if 
  the dish is re-heated. I also added the stock and thickener so it 
  would go better alone with my rice. This is consistent with thousands 
  of Chinese dishes, so I make no apology. The weights and measures 
  are mine, because the Hunan lady called out everything "English style" 
  by count, with no hint how much these ingredients weigh in New York. 
  Fortunately, she had photos. I could see "3 strips of Pork Belly" was 
  a small amount in a bowl. At my local market in Southern California, 
  "3 strips" is nearly 2 pounds. Really, lady, a nice digital scale can 
  be had for around 2020 US $20.</li>
