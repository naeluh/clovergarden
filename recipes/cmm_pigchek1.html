Pork cheeks are an ideal cut for flavorful long cooked stews and braises, 
though not easy to find. Sichuan "red cooked" is quite different from 
"red cooked" in the rest of China, a lot less soy sauce.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK CHEEKS</b> into chunks about 1-1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GINGER</b> lightly, leaving skin on. Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> 
    (white and green) into 2 inch lengths. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>DAIKON</b> into chunks about 1 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Split <b>Cardamom Pod</b> so sauce can penetrate.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> to about 
    330&deg;F/165&deg;C. Stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> until well 
    distributed and aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Pork</b>, and fry stirring until well coated with 
    paste and raw color is completely gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, then all <b>Seasoning items</b>. Bring to 
    a boil, turn heat down, cover and simmer slowly for about 1-3/4 
    hours or until pork is as tender as you want it.</li>
  <li>When you have about 30 minutes to go, stir in <b>Daikon</b>, bring 
    back to a simmer and continue simmering.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid as needed. If served as a main dish with rice it 
    should have plenty of sauce.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> and serve hot with plenty of steamed 
    Thai Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Cheeks:</h3> &nbsp; This is not a common cut - but can be had 
  from specialty butchers and some Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_cheekz.html"><b>Pork Cheek Meat</b></a> page. If 
  you cannot get Pork Cheeks, use meat from pork hocks (unsmoked and 
  without bones or skin) as this meat is similar.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Daikon:</h3> &nbsp; Choose radishes of moderate 
  size, as very large ones are OK for salads, but tend to be fibrous if 
  cooked. Ms. Dunlop suggests Kohlrabi as an alternative, but here in 
  Southern California Daikon is far more readily available than Kohlrabi. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_daikonz.html"><b>Daikon Radish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; In Sichuan bean sauces are made with 
  Fava Beans, not Soybeans. Here in Los Angeles Lian How Brand is readily 
  available (made here in City of Industry), but if you can't find it, 
  a regular Chili Bean Paste will work.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comment:</h3> &nbsp; A recipe for pork cheeks was posted by Cicha 
  Wang, adapted from a Sichuan red-braised beef recipe in Fuchsia Dunlop's 
  book "Land of Plenty". I have returned the recipe closer to Ms. 
  Dunlop's original, but retaining the pork cheeks.They are sufficiently 
  flavorful not to be overwhelmed by a beef recipe.</li>
