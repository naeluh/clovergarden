A bit much for just two? Trust me, you're not going to want less. This 
is really good. If you want a little less rich, see our recipe

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK BELLY</b> thin and mince very small.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Pork</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for 1/2 hour or more.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>SCALLOPS</b> in warm water to cover for about 1 hour 
    (for small ones). Drain and crush into threads. I use the drained 
    water as part of the Stock - it has a lot of the flavor.</li>
  <li>Scrape the <b>FUZZY MELON</b> with the back side of your prep knife 
    to remove the very thin dark green peel. Cut lengthwise into quarters 
    and cut into bite sized wedges with alternating diagonal cuts.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into thin slivers. 
    Mix together <b>Scallop threads</b>, <b>Ginger slivers</b> and all 
    <b>Seasoning items</b>. </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> and 1 T <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>. Fry stirring over high heat until you see 
    a little browning. Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Pork</b> into the pan and fry stirring over high flame 
    until it has completely lost its raw color and you see a trace of 
    browning. Watch the fond that sticks to the pan, reddish is OK, but 
    if it tends to chocolate, go to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and crushed <b>Scallops</b>. Continue 
    stirring another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>, then <b>Stock</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until Fuzzy Melon is tender. This 
    can take from 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir up <b>Cornstarch slurry</b> and stir it in until it thickens 
    the stew.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; If this seems a little rich for you, it is 
  not - no other pork cut would be the same - and the "low fat diet" has 
  been pretty much discredited anyway. Fresh pork belly is available in 
  just about any Asian market.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. Quality varies widely. 
  My current favorite is Megachef (Thai), but it isn't as widely 
  available as Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u>, which is also very good - 
  very Chinese looking bottle, but made in Los Angeles. Yes, these are 
  more expensive, but for a reasons - much higher oyster content, 
  unleaded and no melamine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dried Scallops:</h3> &nbsp; What? You don't have Dried Scallops? 
  OK, use 2 T Dried Shrimp then - not the same, but . . . Dried Scallops 
  are found in markets serving a Chinese community. They range from a 
  little expensive to outrageously expensive depending on size. They 
  are often used with Fuzzy Melon.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Qua] Actually a 
  gourd, this is the immature form of the giant Ash Gourd or Winter 
  Melon. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html">Fuzzy 
  Melon</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Huy Fong Foods (Green cap) is 
  available nearly everywhere, and just as widely respected.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork stock will 
  work fine. Note that for this recipe I use the Scallop soaking 
  liquid as part of the stock.</li>
