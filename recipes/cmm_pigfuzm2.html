A simple but tasty stew. I call it "China / California" because I 
adapted it from a Chinese recipe for <a href="cmm_pigfuzm1.html">
<b>Pork Belly with Fuzzy Melon</b></a>. Of course, this recipe is not 
as rich, but is lower in calories.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (1 hr - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and slice into shreds, or as you please.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Pork</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for 30 minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>SHRIMP</b> well. I run to powder in a spice grinder 
    because Americans aren't accustomed to sharp pointy bits in their 
    food.</li>
  <li>Scrape the <b>FUZZY MELON</b> with the back side of your prep knife 
    to remove the very thin dark green peel. Cut lengthwise into quarters 
    and cut into bite sized wedges with alternating diagonal cuts.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into thin slivers. 
    Mix together with all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> and 1 T <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and stir 
    in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>. Fry stirring over high heat, tumbling 
    constantly, until pieces are speckled with browning. Remove and set 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Over high heat stir in <b>Pork</b> 
    and fry stirring until it has completely lost its raw color, any 
    exutded liquid has evaporated, and you see a trace of browning. Watch 
    the fond that sticks to the pan, reddish is OK, but if it tends to 
    chocolate, go to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and <b>Dried Shrimp</b>. Continue 
    stirring another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>, then <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    cover and simmer until Fuzzy Melon is tender. This can take from 
    10 to 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Scrape any remining fond into the sauce, then stir up <b>Cornstarch 
    slurry</b> and stir it in until it thickens the stew. Adjust liquid 
    if needed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. Just about 
  any cut can be used, and it can be a bit fatty or not as you please.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, 
  use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. Quality varies widely. 
  My current favorite is Megachef (Thai), but it isn't as widely 
  available as Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u>, which is also very good - 
  very Chinese looking bottle, but made in Los Angeles. Yes, these are 
  more expensive, but for a reasons - much higher oyster content, 
  unleaded and no melamine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for whole tiny dried shrimp, 
  or lightly crushed if larger. Easiest way to measure is to half fill 
  a 1/4 cup measure (= 2 T).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Qua] Actually a gourd, this is the 
  immature form of a close relative of the giant Ash Gourd or Winter 
  Melon. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html">Fuzzy Melon</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Huy Fong Foods (Green cap) is 
  available nearly everywhere, and just as widely respected.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork stock will work fine.</li>
