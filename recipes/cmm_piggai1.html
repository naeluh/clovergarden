  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min + 10 min to grind Pork)
  <ol>
  <li>Grind <b>PORK</b>, or chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Strip leaves and tender tops from <b>GAI LAN</b>. Tear leaves into 
    fairly large pieces. Slice stems (including leaf stems) on a shallow 
    diagonal starting at about 1/2 inch at the big end and increasing to 
    about 1-1/2 inches at the thin end. Keep leaves and stems separate.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    cut slices into threads and cut them fine. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very 
    thin. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Lightly crush <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 minutes)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Gai Lan Stems</b> for about 4 minutes. Stir in <b>Gai Lan 
    Leaves</b> until coated with oil and wilted, about 1-1/2 minutes. 
    Remove with a spider and set aside.</li>
  <li>Heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> and stir in  <b>Aromatics mix</b> just 
    until fragrant, then stir in <b>Ground Pork</b>. Fry stirring  until 
    Pork is very lightly browned. Make sure any fond adhering to the 
    pand doesn't get too dark.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a boil for 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Gai Lan</b> until just warmed, then the <b>Sichuan 
    Peppercorns</b>. The liquid should be mostly absorbed by now.</li> 
  <li>Turn off heat and stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless pork with all excess fat 
  removed, and ground - preferably at home.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Gai Lan:</h3> &nbsp; This green looks much like Italian Rapini, 
  but in an odd reversal it's actually broccoli, while Rapini is turnip 
  greens. Most other Asian "cabbages" are actually turnip greens. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_brocccz.html">
  <b>Chinese Broccoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Red or green (same heat). Three, just under 
  2 inches long, make this dish "a little spicy" by Southern 
  California standards. Fresh Arbols, (about 3) are a good substitute, 
  or 1 Serrano (much larger). Use your own best judgment as to how 
  many and how hot.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a drinkable grade of Chinese 
  rice wine (the cooking versions are heavily salted and rather awful). 
  If you don't have the rice wine use a dry sherry (sake is made from 
  rice but not considered a good substitute - it's beer, not wine). For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Vinegar, Black:</h3> &nbsp; [Chinkiang Vinegar] This is a dark 
  rice vinegar, popular in Southern China. Best is from Chinkiang 
  (Zhejiang). For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china">
  <b>Vinegars &amp; Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I could not verify authenticity of the 
  pattern recipe, and it had obviously been "modernized". I studied 
  ground pork recipes (and other recipes) in Fuchsia Dunlop's <i>The 
  Food of Sichuan</i> and corrected it as best I could, thus the 
  "California" part.</li>
