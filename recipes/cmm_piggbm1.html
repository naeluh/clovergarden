  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min + 10 min to grind Pork)
  <ol>
  <li>Grind <b>PORK</b>, or chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BITTER MELON</b> in half lengthwise. Scoop out seed mass 
    with a spoon, then slice crosswise about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Snip <b>Chilis</b> into 1/2 inch lengths and dump out seeds. Stir 
    <b>Sichuan Pepper</b> in with the Chilis.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>If you have real <b>Yibin yaci</b>, rinse it well, it tends to 
    be quite salty. Tianjin Preserved Vegetable, not so much - but 
    fluff it up so it doesn't lump.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 minutes)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, without oil, stir in 
    <b>Bitter Melon</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat until it 
    has softened, and shows traces of browning. Scoop out and set aside.
    </li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, Heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> 
    over high flame. Stir in <b>Ground Pork</b> and fry stirring until  
    it has lost all its raw color and all exuded liquid has evaporated. 
    Then stir in <b>Soy Sauce</b> for a minute. Scoop out and set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Over moderate heat, stir in 
    <b>Chilis</b> and <b>Sichuan Pepper</b>. Fry stirring until Chilis 
    just start to darken, then stir in <b>Garlic</b> for a few seconds. 
    Finally, stir in <b>Yibin yaci</b> for a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b>, then <b>Bitter Melon</b>. Fry stirring until 
    hot. Check for salt (probably not needed).</li>
  <li>Turn off heat and stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve warm as a side dish or appetizer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless pork with all excess fat 
  removed, and ground - preferably at home.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; You want unblemished dark green melons 
  of the Chinese type with smooth warts, and they should feel solid. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html">
  <b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I suggest using Japones, unless you want 
  to go really hot along with the bitter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page. Use 
  your own best judgment as to how many and how hot.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Yibin Yaki:</h3> &nbsp; This is a dried salted and double 
  fermented mustard stems. It is complex to make and difficult to 
  find in North America. The recommended substitute is Tianjin 
  Preserved Vegetable, it's the one that comes in the brown 
  ceramic crock. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_pickle.html">
  <b>Pickled & Preserved Cabbages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I did considerable violence to Fuchsia 
  Dunlop's recipe, thus Sichuan / California. Her basic recipe called 
  for a single 1 pound 2oz Bitter Melon and no Pork. I used her 
  alternative to include ground pork, but used 2 6-1/2 ounce melons 
  (typical size here in California). I upped the pork from 1-3/4 
  ounces to 8 ounces, and restepped the cooking a little so it'd work 
  better with these quantities. She said to dry fry the melon until 
  "reduced in volume and looks wet". Our California melons don't 
  shrink much and start to brown without looking wet.</li>
