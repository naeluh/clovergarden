An interesting contrast of textures and flavors - the cucumber slices are  
cooked crisp-tender and the liver is cooked just firm. The cooking times 
are very short, important for texture, so don't exceed them.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in warm water for about 30 min until fully 
    swollen. Remove any woody anchor points and tear large leaves to about 
    3/4 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>LIVER</b> and pat dry. Place in the freezer until 
    somewhat stiff (about 1 hr), then slice about 1/8 inch thick,and 
    into  strips 1-12 inches long by the thickness of the liver.</li>
  <li>Over very high heat bring plenty of water to a boil. Stir in the 
    <b>Liver</b> slices and bring back to a boil as quickly as possible. 
    When the water just starts to boil, drain the liver slices and quench 
    in cold water. Drain well.</li> 
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into the <b>Liver</b> 
    slices. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes turning a couple of 
    times.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBER</b> thin on a diagonal. See <a href="cmm_piglivcuk1.html#03">Note-3</a>.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very 
    thin and cut into narrow threads. Mix.</li>     
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan. Stir in 
    <b>Black Fungus</b> until coated with oil, then stir in <b>Stock</b> 
    and <b>Rice Wine</b>. Continue to cook, stirring until liquid has 
    evaporated, then stir in <b>Cucumbers</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Continue to fry stirring for about 30 seconds, then remove all from 
    the pan and keep warm. The cucumbers should still have some crunch.</li>
  <li>Clean and dry the pan. Heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> very hot. Stir in 
    <b>Ginger mix</b> until coated with oil, then stir in <b>Liver</b> and 
    fry turning until the marinade is nearly dried out (about 1 minute). 
    Fold in the <b>Cucumber Mix</b> just until mixed and take off 
    heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped scallions if you wish, and with 
    plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as Wood Ears and 
  Cloud Ears and sold dry in plastic bags in any East Asian market.  It 
  expands greatly in size when soaked. for details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Livers</h3> can be found in any respectable Asian or Latino 
  meat market. They weigh between 1 and 1-3/4 pound each. This recipe 
  can also be made using calf's liver if desired.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cucumber:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible use a thin 
  cucumber that need neither seeding nor peeling: Persian, European, 
  Japanese, or whatever. Lacking them use kerbys sliced in half lengthwise, 
  seeded and sliced without peeling. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html#var"><b>Cucumbers</b></a> page.</li>
