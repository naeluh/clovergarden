An interesting and satisfying noodle dish from Shanghai. It can be made 
vegetarian by omitting the pork, with little change in taste. This 
recipe will serve as a substantial "one dish meal" for 3 or 4 depending 
on size and hunger.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and cut slices into strips less than 1/4 
    inch wide and up to 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Add all <b>Marinade items</b> to the <b>Pork</b> and massage it 
    in well. Set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Boil plenty of salted Water and stir in <b>NOODLES</b>. Bring 
    back to a boil over high heat, then boil until the Noodles no 
    longer taste raw, but are still firm. This will depend on brand, 
    2 to 4 minutes. Drain, refresh with cold water and drain well. 
    Tumble with 1 t <b>Oil</b> to prevent sticking.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a well seasoned frying pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> over high 
    flame. Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring, separating the strips, 
    until they have completely lost their raw color. Remove from the pan 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Set the pan aside to soak for cleaning (see 
    <a href="cmm_pigndl1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li>In a wok, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> over high flame. Stir in 
    <b>Noodles</b>. Fry tumbling for a minute or so, then stir in 
    <b>Sauce mix</b>. Continue to tumble until hot.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Greens</b>. Tumble until wilted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork Strips</b>. Tumble until hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. Arrange on plates using tongs, as the three main 
    ingredients insist on gathering together separately from the other 
    ingredients. Leftovers can be reheated in the oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shanghai Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These are thick 
  springy noodles similar to Japanese Udon (an acceptable substitute). 
  They are about about 0.30 inch diameter, sold in the refrigerated 
  section of Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html"><b>Asian Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Greens:</h3> &nbsp; These must be tiny greens 
  that cook extremely fast. The "official" greens are tiny leaves of 
  Shanghai Bok Choy called "Chicken Feather Greens" (see 
  <a href="cmm_pigndl1.html#05">Note-5</a>). The pattern recipe suggests, if these are 
  not available, to use a couple handsful of Baby Spinach. For Details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_boksz.html"><b>Shanghai Bok Choy</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cleaning the Pan:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  uses the wok for the pork with a cleaning step. She mentions to 
  re-season the wok if needed, so she obviously expects some heavy 
  scrubbing. This step takes too much time and attention. We want to 
  finish and serve quickly and smoothly. Alternately, you can use the 
  wok for the pork and do the clean-up as a prep step done in advance. 
  This would leave time for soaking to greatly reduce scrubbing.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I'm sure the little Shanghai Bok Choy Mui 
  I used was larger than the "chicken feather" size mentioned in the 
  pattern recipe, but there was enough time for them to wilt and lose 
  their raw taste. I did cut off a few of the larger stem bottoms. It's 
  a race between cooking the greens and the noodles starting to stick 
  to the pan, but the noodles I used (Golden World, Baldwin Park CA) 
  were quite sturdy and could have taken a bit more. The photo with 
  the pattern recipe shows the noodles much darker, so I wouldn't 
  fear using a bit more of the sauce, but it was fine as given here.</li>
