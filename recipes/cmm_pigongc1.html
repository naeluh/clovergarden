Ong Choy is quite popular in Asian communities, and makes a fairly simple 
stir fry with good flavor and interesting texture. It is illegal in many 
states, but allowed for certified growers in California.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 50 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> into 1/8 inch thick strips about 1-1/2 to 2 inches 
    long by 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>, massage into pork and let marinate 
    for at least 45 minutes, or 2 hours refrigerated.</li>
  <li>Pinch Leaves from  <b>ONG CHOY</b> stems, leaving the leaf stems  
    attached to the main stems. The leaves are usually very long and prone 
    to tangle, so I set the whole pile of picked leaves on my cutting board 
    and make one cut through the pile, then another cut at right angles.
    </li>
  <li>Discard any stem pieces more than 1/4 inch diameter and cut all 
    stems, including leaf stems, into lengths of about 1-1/2 inch, no 
    longer. Keep separate from the leaves.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into medium dice.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and cut in half lengthwise, then slice thin 
    crosswise. 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> very hot in a wok (you'll need the space) and sir in 
    <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until pork loses its raw color and starts to 
    brown, being careful not to burn the fond that sticks to the wok. 
    Remove and set aside in a strainer to drain excess oil.</li>
  <li>Add more <b>Oil</b> if needed and fry <b>Onion</b> over moderate heat 
    until almost translucent, then stir in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring a 
    bit longer being careful not to burn the fond adhering to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ong Choy Stems</b> and <b>Tomato</b>, then <b>Stock</b>. 
     Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally until Ong Choy stems are tender 
    (about 4 minutes - the biggest ones should remain a bit crisp).</li>
  <li>Scatter 1/3 of the <b>Ong Choy Leaves</b> over the stew and stir 
    in, then do the other 2/3 the same way. After they have wilted 
    thoroughly (about 2 minutes) stir the <b>Pork</b> back in. Simmer 
    covered, stirring occasionally until pork is well incorporated and 
    hot, about another 2 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Shrimp Paste</b>. Adjust liquid (not too dry if it's going 
    with rice) and <b>Salt</b> to taste (if any is needed).</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ong Choy:</h3> &nbsp; [Water Spinach] &nbsp; Legal in California but 
  contraband in some states. Large Asian markets here in Los Angeles almost 
  always have it. For details see our <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html">
  <b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese black shrimp paste for authenticity 
  but Southeast Asian pastes will work fine if that's what you have. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html">
  <b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Authenticity</u>: In China the amount 
  of pork would be about half what is given here - see our 
  <a href="../regions/adopt.html"><b>Western Adoption of Asian 
  Food</b></a> page.</li>
