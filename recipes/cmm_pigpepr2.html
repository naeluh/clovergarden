<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Belly</h3> &nbsp; Also known "fresh bacon", this is available 
  at any East or Southeast Asian market. Thick bacon can be substituted 
  for a somewhat different flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Frying Peppers,</h3> &nbsp; Most common (in some regions) are 
  "Italian Frying Peppers" (Cubanelle), but here in Southern California 
  they are not at all common. Sometimes we have non-hot Hungarian, 
  Armenian, Turkish or Gypsy peppers which are very similar. Lacking 
  those I'd use Green Anaheims - thicker wall, but not much heat. Failing 
  all those, you could use regular Bell Peppers. Whatever pepper you use, 
  <u>Don't overcook</u>, just crisp tender. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These dry black fermented soy beans are 
  packed in bags or cardboard boxes. Popular all over China and in 
  Southeast Asia, they can be found in any Chinese market. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black 
  Beans</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Potato Starch:</h3> &nbsp; You can substitute Cornstarch, but use 
  about 1/3 more and stir in quickly, it's less tolerant.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary, Poland and Czech 
  Republic. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats they urged us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If 
  you still don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), 
  or Avocado oil (richer flavor).</li>
