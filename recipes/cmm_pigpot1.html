This very flavorful dish is "red cooked". That means it's cooked in a soy 
sauce broth. Little of the broth goes to the plate as sauce, but can be 
replenished and used again for the next red cooked dish, building 
complexity over time.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK BELLY</b> into 1/2 inch slices. Cut the slices 
    crosswise 1/2 inch wide and fully across so nearly every piece 
    has skin at one end. Place in a saucepan with water to cover and 
    bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Pour out into a clean sink and 
    rinse thoroughly, discarding water. Drain well.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut into narrow shreds.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Pork Belly</b> with <b>Rice Wine</b>. 
    Let marinate for at least 1 hour, turning over now and then.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and slice 1/2 inch thick. Cut slices into 
   convenient pieces. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Broth items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain <b>Pork Belly</b>. The marinade can be drained into the 
    broth as it is compatible.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> until 
    it begins to shimmer (390&deg;F). Stir in 1/2 the <b>Pork</b> and 
    fry stirring over hot flame for about 4 minutes. You will see just 
    a little browning. Remove with a spider or slotted spoon and drain. 
    Repeat with the other half of the <b>Pork</b>.</li>
  <li>Pour out the Oil, there will be more than you started with. You 
    can use it to fry eggs or something.</li>
  <li>Return all <b>Pork</b> to the pan along with <b>Potatoes</b>. Fry 
    stirring over high heat for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth</b>. Bring to a simmer and simmer covered for 
    about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li> Strain out solids. Return some broth to the Pork and Potatoes  
    as sauce. Save the rest for future red cooked dishes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; This is the stuff bacon is 
  make out of, but fresh, not cured. It is easily available in the meat 
  department of markets serving Asian communities, often in trays precut 
  to slices 1/2 inch thick, but it can be much cheaper as a whole slab 
  from the service counter. It is almost always used skin-on. It may also 
  be available in markets serving Latino and Eastern European communities. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html">Pork Belly</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well here. 
  "Yukon Gold" type potatoes must be avoided as they will disintegrate 
  into mush when cooked this long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; In keeping with Asian tastes, 
  the pattern recipe calls for 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar. My taste 
  doesn't run that sweet, and I consider sugar a Great Evil, so I use 
  rather little or none at all. Adjust to your preference.</li>
