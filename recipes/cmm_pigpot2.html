This is an excellent stew, with just the right amount of chili heat for 
enjoyment (in my opinion). It is easy to make, economical, satisfying 
and it reheats very well, so is a great make-ahead for parties. It has 
quite a bit of liquid, so goes very well served with steamed rice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into about 1-1/2 inch chunks. Place in a saucepan 
    with water to cover and bring to a boil for 1 minute. Pour out into 
    a clean sink, discarding water. Rinse thoroughly and drain.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into pieces similar to the pork. 
    Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut the White parts from the <b>Scallions</b> and whack them with 
    the side of your prep knife to lightly crush them. Cut the Green 
    parts into 1-1/2 inch lengths and keep them separate from the Whites.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and mix with the White parts of the 
    Scallions.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a 3 quart saucepan or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over 
    moderate heat. Stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> until aromatic, 
    then stir in the <b>Ginger mix</b> until aromatic. Stir in the 
    <b>Pork</b>, <b>Stock</b> and <b>Rice Wine</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    then simmer covered about 1 hour until the Pork is tender.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in with the Pork. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer covered until the Potatoes are fully 
    cooked, about 25 minutes. Check seasoning - you probably will 
    have enough salt from the Chili Bean Paste.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with the <b>Scallion Greens</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Just about any reasonably 
  lean cut will work fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well here. 
  Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes they will disintegrate into mush when 
  cooked a bit long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Sichuan Chili Bean 
  Paste is made from Broad Beans (Favas). If you can't find it, another 
  Chili Bean Paste can be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese recipes almost always 
  call for Chicken Stock for everything, but Pork Stock will also work 
  here. A very simple unsalted stock is fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
