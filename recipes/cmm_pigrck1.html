A dish with an amazing number of different flavors and textures, and 
they stay delightfully distinct due to short cooking time. This 
recipe can be served as a "one dish meal" as in includes rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless meat with excess fat 
  removed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; These are dried Shiitakes, available 
  even in regular supermarkets in their Asian section. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but a hassle and not 
  always available. Best to buy in vacuum pack bags (unless your market 
  has them in a bulk tub). Canned is available everywhere, but needs to 
  be par boiled for 5 minutes or more to remove the metallic taste.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chinese Ham:</h3> &nbsp; It is not legal to import Chinese 
  hams, so many Asian markets sell slices of American Virginia dry cured 
  (country) ham for this purpose. There are also other Chinese style 
  cured pork products that can be used, or Italian Prosciutto. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_hams.html"><b>Hams</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice Ovals:</h3> &nbsp; These are very popular in Korea, so are 
  available in markets serving a Korean community. They are sold fresh, 
  refrigerated or frozen. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese recipes almost always call for Chicken 
  stock, but Pork stock will work well too.</li>
