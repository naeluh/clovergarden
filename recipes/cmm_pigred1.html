A favorite dish of Chairman Mao (it's "Red" cooked, after all). You can 
vary the richness by what part of the pig you use (see <a href="cmm_pigred1.html#01">
<b>Note-1</b></a>) but it shouldn't be too lean. This dish can be eaten  
as is, but is also often finished with other ingredients.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork belly:</h3> also called "uncured bacon" is readily 
  available in East and Southeast Asian markets, this should be "skin on" 
  if possible. It may be sold as a slab or may be sliced but should not be 
  sliced thinner than about 3/8 inch. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html"><b>Pork Belly</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I've cut this back from the original 
  recipe which called for 2 T plus option for more. That's just too sweet 
  for me. In home cooking many just use dark soy sauce instead of 
  caramelized sugar - but you aren't escaping sugar if you do that - it's 
  in the dark soy.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Thai chilis or Arbols will 
  do fine. for details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cassia:</h3> &nbsp; This is what is sold as "Cinnamon Sticks" in 
  North America, so you probably already have it.</li>
