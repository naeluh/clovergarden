A different take on spare ribs, with enough sauce to be a main dish with 
rice, rather than an appetizer. In hard working Hunan a half T 
of lard would be added to the topping but that's a bit much for around 
here.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths of 1-1/2 to 2 inches. 
    A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect 
    for this. Remove all excess fat.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a high boil, add the ribs and let 
    blanch for around 3 minutes. Rinse and drain well.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Rinse the <b>BLACK BEANS</b> and very lightly crush them.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Ribs</b> with <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Rice Wine</b> and 
    <b>Ginger</b>. Place in a shallow heatproof bowl that fits in your 
    steamer (see <a href="cmm_pigrib6x.html#gal"><b>Photo 
    Gallery</b></a>) and top with <b>Black Beans</b> and <b>Chili 
    Flakes</b>. You should be fairly liberal with the chili flakes, 
    particularly if using Korean.</li>
  <li>Arrange the bowl in your steamer. Bring to a boil uncovered (this 
    cuts down the amount of water that will gather in the bowl). Cover 
    the steamer and steam over fairly rapidly boiling water for about 45 
    minutes, making sure you don't run out of water.</li>
  <li>Mix up contents of the bowl well (it will have gathered a fair 
    amount of water) and serve hot with rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing all excess fat, 
  but with bone and cartilage in.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are salty fermented black soybeans 
  sold in plastic bags and cylindrical paper boxes in any market serving 
  an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Easily available Korean 
  chili flake works well enough though a bit mild. Crushed dried red 
  de Arbols or Thai chilis are good for hotter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a>
