Pork Stomach is meatier than Beef Tripe, as pigs are not herbivours, 
but omnivours like we are. Pork Stomach has a special affinity to 
Ginger.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak cleaned <b>PORK STOMACH</b> in salted water.  Massage it well, 
    drain and wipe. Then, <u>twice</u> put it a pot with salted water to 
    cover, add some citric acid or lemon juice, bring to a boil for 15 
    minutes. Pour out, rinse, and wipe. Clean the pot. Put the Pork 
    Stomach back in, cover with fresh water and add some Scallions and 
    slices of Ginger. Bring to a boil and simmer until al dente - about 
    1 hours. It'll still be a bit chewy, that's its nature. Cooking it 
    longer, the layers will start to separate and it'll be messy. 
    Rinse well and discard cooking water.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Slice <b>Pork Stomach</b> into thin shreds about 1-1/2 to 2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut the slices into thin threads. 
    Chop <b>SCALLION WHITES</b> fairly fine. Mix with Ginger. Cut 
    <b>Greens</b> as desired for Garnish and set aside.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off 
    skins under running water (see <a href="cmm_pigstom1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). 
    Core and cut into strips about 1/4 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.
    Mix with <b>Bell Peppers</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Ginger mix</b> stirring until aromatic. Stir in sliced 
    <b>Pork Stomach</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice Wine</b> and continue to fry 1 minute more.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bell Pepper mix</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Pepper</b>. Fry 
    stirring until Bell Peppers are crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, bring it up to a boil, then stir up the 
    <b>Starch</b> and stir it in until it thickens some.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Scallion Greens</b>. and with steamed 
    Jasmine rice. You can provide <b>Chili Garlic Sauce</b> on the side 
    for anyone who'd like to hot it up a bit.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Stomach:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is "as purchased", and will result 
  in 50% of that weight cooked. Pork stomach can be found in Asian 
  markets that have good meat department, or from some Eastern European 
  and Central and South American markets. It is quite different from 
  beef tripe because pigs are omnivours, like us, not herbivours. For 
  full details on preparation, see our <a href="../ingred/ap_stomz.html">
  <b>Pig Stomach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ginger Root</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe mentioned that in China, 
  Young Ginger would be used. This is seasonal, not always available here 
  in Los Angeles, and probably never in most of North America. Do select 
  Ginger Root that is as fresh and tender as you can find. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gg_gingerz.html"><b>Ginger</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid salted "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. 
  Sake is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Blasting Peppers</h3> &nbsp; This was not called for in the pattern 
  recipe, and was not done for the photo example. It does greatly 
  improve the texture of the dish and cooking properties of the peppers. 
  It is easy, and takes only a few minutes using your 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>, and doesn't 
  cook the peppers at all.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This was not in the pattern recipe, but I find 
  this dish goes down better with rice if there's at least some liquid.
  </li>
