  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin with the grain, and cut slices into very 
    narrow strips, again with the grain so they hold together well.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Pork</b>. Let 
    stand for at least 30 minutes, turning now and then.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHILIS</b> in half lengthwise, core, and cut into very fine 
    strips. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into fine 
    threads. Mix.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEK</b> to white, yellow and light green. Split down to the 
    root end, spread leaves and rinse out any mud. Slice crosswise into 
    very narrow shreds. Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into strips about 1/4 inch 
    wide. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Sichuan Veg.</b> into strips similar to the pork (if not 
    already shreded from can or package). Rinse lightly to reduce 
    saltiness - but not too much.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan  heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Chili mix</b> over fairly high heat, stirring for about 40 seconds 
    until aromatic. Stir in the <b>Leek mix</b> and continue to fry 
    stirring for about 1-1/2 minutes. The Bell Pepper should remain 
    quite crisp. Scoop out and set aside.</li>
  <li>Wipe out the wok or pan so there are no bits to burn.</li>
  <li>In the same pan, heat 2 T <b>oil</b> over very high heat and stir in 
    the <b>Pork</b> and <b>Sichuan Veg.</b> Fry stirring until Pork has 
    completely lost its raw color and any exude liquid has evaporated, 
    then stir <b>Vegetable mix</b> back in along with <b>Stock</b>. 
    Stir over high heat until back up to a strong simmer.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresno peppers, 
  but Holland Red or similar medium hot chilis will work. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Leek</h3> Weight given is for a leek as purchased. It will weigh 
  less when the dark green parts are trimmed off. Chinese leeks are long 
  and slender, but taste similar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sichuan Vegetable:</h3> &nbsp; [Zha cai] &nbsp; This is the 
  swolen stem of a mutant mustard plant, salt pickled with chili and 
  pressed. It is commonly available canned, both as chunks and as shreds, 
  and increasingly in plastic vacuum packs. Here in Los Angeles it can 
  also be purchased fresh from tubs in some Asian markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_szechz.html"><b>Sichuan Vegetable</b></a> 
  page. Today Sichuan is no longer spelled "Szechuan", but the cans still 
  use the old spelling.</li>
