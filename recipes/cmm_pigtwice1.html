Very tasty, rich and satisfying, though not exactly your low calorie cuisine. 
The bean pastes used are a bit different from those used in the rest of 
China and a bit harder to find, but worth it.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5-1/2 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare your slab of <b>PORK</b>. Bring plenty of water (or stock 
    if available) to a boil in a large pot, drop in the <b>Pork</b>, 
    bring back to a boil and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes until cooked 
    through. Reserve the resulting broth for another use.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Pork</b> from the pot, cool it thoroughly, then 
    refrigerate until it is thoroughly chilled all the way through.</li>
  <li>When <b>Pork</b> is thoroughly chilled, slice it thin. Individual 
    pieces should be about 1 inch (skin to lean) by 2 inches long and 
    less than 1/4 inch thick. Every slice should have layers each of 
    skin, fat and lean.</li>
  <li>Slice tender part of <b>LEEKS</b> thin on a steep diagonal into 
    "horse ear" slices.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BLACK BEANS</b>, crush them very lightly and mix with 
    <b>Sweet Bean Paste</b>.</li>
  <li>Measure out your <b>Chili Bean Paste</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a wok and sir in <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring 
    over moderately high heat until much of the fat has melted out and the 
    slices are getting crispy on the outside and starting to curl. 
    You're going to have some spattering here because pork skin does that.</li>
  <li>Push the <b>Pork</b> up the side of the wok or remove it with a slotted 
    spoon (necessary in smaller or steeper woks). At this point you can 
    spoon or pour out some fat if it looks like too much, but there should 
    still be at least a couple tablespoons. Stir in <b>Chili Bean Paste</b> 
    until the oil is red and fragrant, just a few seconds. Stir in <b>Black 
    Bean mix</b> and fry stirring for a few seconds until aromatic, then 
    stir <b>Pork</b> back in.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. If you need to hold it, 
    hold at this point.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Leeks</b> and fry stirring until they are just cooked 
    through, just a minute or two. Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork with Skin:</h3> &nbsp; In Sichuan this would be 
  cut from the thigh and would be a slab with about 1/2 lean and 1/2 fat. 
  This cut is not generally available in the U.S. so &Uuml;ber expert 
  Fuchsia Dunlop recommends using a slab of pork belly, but that's quite 
  a bit fattier (though very tasty!). I cut a slab from the skin side of 
  a picnic shoulder and cut the slices a bit wider (more lean). A leg 
  would do fine too.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Leeks:</h3> &nbsp; Whole large Chinese Leeks are often unavailable 
  even in Los Angeles. They are long and narrow, more tender than regular 
  leeks but sharp and garlicky in taste. If you don't have them get the 
  smallest, longest youngest regular leeks you can find and cook them a 
  bit longer than Chinese leeks would take. Optionally slice up a couple 
  cloves of garlic to toss in with the leeks.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are salty fermented black soybeans 
  sold in plastic bags and cylindrical paper boxes in any market serving 
  an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Fermented Black Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bean Pastes:</h3> &nbsp; Authenticity demands chili and sweet bean 
  pastes made with fava beans (broad beans) rather than the soy beans 
  used in the rest of China. I use Lian How brand for both pastes. Ms. 
  Dunlop suggests using a sweet fermented wheat flour paste if you can't 
  find the sweet bean paste.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lard or Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional  
  frying medium through Thailand and much of China. The American 
  Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid to use it, 
  but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats the AHA urged us 
  to use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is 
  now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't   want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or Avocado oil 
  for richer flavor.</li>
