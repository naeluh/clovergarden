With interesting flavors and contrasting textures, this vegetarian 
"one dish meal" is quick to make. It should be served immediately it is 
done, but leftovers can be reheated in the oven.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but 
  a hassle and not always available. Best to buy in vacuum pack bags 
  (unless your market has them in a bulk tub). Canned is available 
  everywhere, but needs to be par boiled for 5 minutes or more to 
  remove the metallic taste.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Soybeans, Frozen:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for 
  beans only, removed from the pod. These are available in the frozen 
  cases of Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soyz.html"><b>Soy Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Ovals:</h3> &nbsp; These are very popular 
  in Korea, so are available in markets serving a Korean community. 
  They are sold fresh, refrigerated or dried. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Shanghai Greens:</h3>> &nbsp; [Snow Vegetable] 
  &nbsp; Measure is with liquid. This is salt fermented (pickled) mustard 
  greens. They are available in larger Asian markets, usually packed 
  in plastic bags or tubs in the refrigerated section. They can be 
  easily made at home, though it takes fermenting time. See our recipe 
  <a href="cpv_snowvg1.html"><b>Snow Vegetable</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use 
  a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
