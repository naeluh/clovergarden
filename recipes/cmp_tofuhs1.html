  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>TOFU</b> 1/2 inch thick, then cut slices into 1-1/2 to 2 
    inch squares, or however works with your blocks of Tofu.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and into about 1 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths. Keep Whites and 
    Greens separate.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> fairly thin. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    cut the slices into slivers. Mix all with Scallion Whites.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok, heat 3/4 cup <b>Oil</b> over highest heat. In batches, 
    fry <b>Tofu</b> golden. Remove with your Spider and drain on paper 
    towels.</li>
  <li>Pour out excess <b>Oil</b>, leaving only 3 Tablespoons. Return to 
    heat and stir in <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Turn heat to medium. Stir in <b>Chili Bean Sauce</b> until well 
    distributed and aromatic. Stir in the <b>Scallion mix</b> and fry 
    stirring until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, then <b>Tofu</b>. Season with <b>Sugar</b> 
   (if used), and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil, then turn down 
   to a simmer for about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallion Greens</b> for a couple seconds, then stir 
    up <b>Cornstarch</b> and stir it in until it coats the Tofu nicely.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Scallions:</h3> &nbsp; To pattern recipe calls for "Baby Leeks", 
  but you are not likely to have those, so Scallions are also allowed.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Sichuan Chili Bean 
  Sauce, which is made form Chilis and Fava Beans instead if Soy Beans. 
  If you don't have that, some other Chili Bean Sauce will work. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_pdfavaz.html"><b>Broad Bean 
  Products</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03"> 
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be done ahead through deep 
  frying the Tofu. The remaining recipe will take 15 minutes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  Depending on how hungry you eaters, this 
  recipe may be stretchable to three mains, and definitely to three 
  light lunches, or if there's another dish. It reheats quite well if 
  you have leftovers. While medium Tofu is called for, the photo 
  example was made with firm, because that was what I had, and it was 
  still OK. The pattern recipe, like practically all Asian recipes, 
  included Sugar (1/2 t), but to North American tastes, this is not 
  at all needed.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; I use a carbon steel wok or kadhai for this, 
  not my tri-ply stainless one. Deep frying will leave an ugly coating 
  of varnish on the sides that takes oven cleaner to remove. This coating 
  is "seasoning" and desirable on a carbon steel wok.</li>
