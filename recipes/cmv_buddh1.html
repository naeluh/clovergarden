  <b><u>Soaking</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>TOFU BAMBOO</b> in warm water until softened through - 
    up to 2 hours for the Bean Curd Sticks I used in the photo example. 
    Cut into about 1 inch lengths, discarding any spots that are still 
    hard. If you're lucky enough to get fresh pouches, just cut into 
    about 3/4 inch squares.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>SHIITAKES</b> in hot water about 20 minutes. Stem and 
    cut into about 1/2 inch squares. If using dried Shiitakes (Black 
    Mushroom) soak in tepid water for an hour at least.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in cool water until rehydrated, about 
    45 minutes. Remove any hard parts and cut into 1 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN NOODLES</b> in warm water for about 10 minutes. 
    Drain. Make a couple cuts through the pile to make them more 
    manageable.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
    <ol start="5">
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and slice thin. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and cut slices into narrow matchsticks. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BEECH MUSHROOMS</b> away from their matrix, discarding the 
    matrix.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>GAI LAN </b> leaves and cut stems diagonally into bite 
    size pieces, shorter at the thick end and longer at the thin end. 
    Chop <b>Leaves</b> quite coarse and hold separate from the stems.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOT</b> a little over 1/8 inch thick and cut 
    into bite size pieces. Add to the Gai Lan Stems.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FRIED TOFU</b> blocks in half. Add to the Gai Lan Stems</li>
  <li>Peel <b>WATER CHESTNUTS</b> and cut in half. Add to the Gai Lan 
    Stems.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SNOW PEAS</b> stem end off, then in half crosswise.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Potato Starch</b> with 2 T <b>Water</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Garlic mix</b> a few seconds 
    until aromatic. Stir in <b>All Mushrooms</b> and <b>Black Fungus</b>. 
    Fry stirring for about a minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in all <b>Middle Items</b>, then 4 c <b>Water</b>, 1/3 c 
    and the <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer until Gai 
    Lan Stems are just crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Snow Peas</b>,<b>Bean Threads</b> and as much of the 
    <b>Gai Lan Leaves</b> as you want. Simmer a minute or so.</li>
  <li>Stir up the <b>Potato Starch mix</b>. Pour it into the pan and 
    stir until the sauce thickens some.</li>
  <li>Take off heat and stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b></li>
  <li>Serve hot accompanied by steamed Jasmine rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tofu Bamboo:</h3> &nbsp; [Bean Curd Sticks] &nbsp; This is rolled 
  up and dried Tofu Skins, and comes in several forms, both dried and 
  fresh. The given weight is for dried. Fresh or soaked will be 
  at least twice that. The photo example used dried "Tofu Sticks". but 
  cut fresh "Pouches" would work fine too. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#yuba"><b>Tofu</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shiitake Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh have become pretty common,  
  at least here in California. You could also use 1/2 the weight in 
  dried, usually sold as "Black Mushrooms", which are available pretty 
  much everywhere. The dried need about 45 minutes soak in warm water. 
  Soaking Fresh Shiitakes greatly improves their texture. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; This can be found in just about any 
  market that carries a decent variety of Asian ingredients. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bean Thread Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These are often sold in 1.8 or 
  2 ounce packets. Either size will work fine here. Do not confuse 
  these with Rice Noodles, which can look the same dry, but have very 
  different cooking properties. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html#bean"><b>Asian Noodles</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Beech Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; [Hon-Shimeji] &nbsp; These are sold 
  around here in small plastic tubs holding a little over 5 ounces. You 
  will have to cut away the matrix they are grown in, so a 5 ounce tub 
  yields a little over 3 ounces of usable 'shrooms. If you don't have 
  Beech Mushrooms, use one of the firmer versions of Oyster mushrooms, 
  cut as appropriate. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Gai Lan:</h3> &nbsp; This is Chinese Broccoli, quite a bit 
  different from Western Broccoli. It is widely available in Asian 
  markets. A good substitute is Yu Choy which is not closely related 
  but looks much the same. Both are quite stemmy, and the stems of 
  both are tender and cook quite quickly. Western Broccoli can be used, 
  but cook it separately until just tender, and add it with the Final 
  Items. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Deep Fried Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; These are available in pretty much any 
  Asian market. Select soft blocks about 1-1/2 inch on a side. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#fry"><b>Tofu</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Water Chestnuts:</h3> &nbsp; These taste much better fresh than 
  canned. Of course fresh ones have to be peeled. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sd_wchestz.html"><b>Water Chestnuts</b></a> page.
  </li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; All the items included should be cut into 
  a size that can be eaten and tasted individually, but should not 
  be so large as to be difficult to eat in one bite. All should be 
  cooked the minimum time that will make them pleasant to eat. Garlic 
  would probably not be included in a purely Buddhist stew.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Do Ahead</h3> &nbsp; This dish is best finished just before 
  serving, but, the Soaking section can be done at least a day ahead, 
  and prep for Middle items and Finish Items can be done hours ahead 
  or even overnight refrigerated. This makes it a practical party 
  dish with a very short final cooking time. It can be reheated, but 
  the bright green colors will be faded.</li>
