Very commonly made at home, but so familiar it has largely escaped the 
notice of cookbook writers. Quick, easy to make, a good light main dish 
for 3 or an interesting side dish for 5. It is quite mild, so can 
accompany dishes that aren't.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scrape <b>FUZZY MELON</b> with the backside of your prep knife so as 
    to remove only the fuzzy outer skin. Slice about 1/8 inch thick and cut 
    the slices into strips about 1/4 inch wide and about 1-1/2 inches long.
    </li>
  <li>Soak <b>DRIED SHRIMP</b> in water to cover for about 15 minutes 
    (see <a href="cmv_fuzmel1.html#03">Note-2</a>). Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Put <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in a heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over 
    and let them soak for about a minute, then pour out the water and replace 
    with cool water for 15 minutes or so. Drain and make a few cuts through 
    the bundle so they aren't too long.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOT</b> fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop 
    very fine, Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan and sir in 
    <b>Shallot Mix</b> and <b>Shrimp</b>. Fry stirring until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>, <b>Rice Wine</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and 1/2 
    cup <b>Water</b>. Mix well and bring quickly to a boil. Cover and simmer 
    over moderate heat until melon just starts to become translucent, about 
    4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check that there's enough liquid and stir in <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Sugar</b>. Stir in <b>Bean Threads</b> and cook over moderately high 
    heat, turning a couple of times, just until bean threads are heated 
    through.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; This is an immature winter 
  melon. Most Asian recipes presume they're about the size of a cucumber 
  and weigh about 1/2 pound, but here in Southern California they're 
  usually quite a bit larger. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html">Fuzzy Melon</a> page </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for small ones 
  whole. Find them in markets serving Asian, Mexican and South 
  American communities. The photo shows them per the original recipe, but 
  since Americans aren't accustomed to sharp pointy things in their food, 
  you may want instead to run them in your spice grinder and toss the 
  powder in just before the melon.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; Don't confuse mung bean 
  threads with the very similar looking rice sticks, they cook quite 
  differently.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese don't like 
  little black specs, so they use White Pepper. Black Pepper has more 
  flavor, and that's what I use, but then I'm one of those despised 
  barbarians.</li>
