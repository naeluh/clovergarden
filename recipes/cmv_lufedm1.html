This is a simple light main or brunch dish, but very tasty. It can 
easily be made vegetarian (see below) but will be a bit less tasty 
that way.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Luffa:</h3> &nbsp; (Loofah, Chinese Okra) This may 
  be angled luffa sold around here as "Chinese Okra" or smooth luffa (if 
  you can find it). For the photo, smooth luffa was used. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/gd_luffaz.html"><b>Luffa</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ham or Bacon</h3> &nbsp; If using Bacon, use a block from the deli, 
  or "ends and pieces" so you can cut it fairly thick. The pattern recipe 
  calls for Chinese or Spanish ham, but Chinese ham is not allowed into 
  the United States. Spanish ham now is, but is hideously expensive on 
  this side of the Atlantic. A good quality regular smoked ham will be 
  fine. If you are Vegetarian, you will have to skip these, but that 
  deprivation was your own choice. Maybe toss in some shreds of spiced 
  pressed Tofu (Stew Tofu), or small Fried Gluten Puffs</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Edamame:</h3> &nbsp; This immature soybeans are quite common now, 
  in both Asian markets and supermarkets. They come in the pod and 
  shelled, which is how you want them for convenience and economy. for 
  details se our <a href="../ingred/bp_soyz.html"><b>Soybeans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine - not those horrid salted "cooking" wines. Lacking 
  that, use a dry sherry. Sake is not considered a good substitute. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice 
  Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock</h3> &nbsp; Chicken Stock is the standard, but vegetarians 
  will need to use vegetable stock - see our 
  <a href="cov_vgstock1.html"><b>Chinese Vegetable Stock</b></a> for 
  typical stocks.</li>
