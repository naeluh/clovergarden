This is a simple fish soup - but a fish soup to rave about! Zhoushan is 
a cluster of many islands off the coast of Ningbo, so seafood is a big 
thing there. The way potatoes and tomatoes are used in this dish 
suggests a European influence.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr, - 45 min work)
    <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>FISH</b> and fillet. Use heads, bones, and fins to make 
    the fish stock needed by this recipe. If you will not use the fillets 
    within 8 hours, freeze on a tray in a single layer. For details of 
    making stock, see our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">
    <b>Making Fish Stock</b></a> - or see <a href="cof_fshchow1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.
    </li>
    </ol> 
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;(20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILLETS</b> into medium bite size pieces. Place in a 
    bowl with <b>Marinade items</b> and tumble to coat well. Set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>POTATOES</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut large slices 
    into bite size pieces.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Peel and cut into 
    chunks about 3/4 inches.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GINGER</b> and slice about 1/8 inch thick. Cut slices into 
    strips about 1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLION WHITES</b> from the <b>GREENS</b>. Reserve the 
    Greens for Garnish. Lightly crush the Whites to loosen them.</li>     
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat oil. Stir in 
    <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Scallion Whites</b> until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in 2 T <b>Rice Wine</b> and let it sizzle for a moment, 
    then stir in <b>Fish Stock</b>  and <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer until Potatoes are tender.</li>
  <li>When the Potatoes have had 10 minutes cooking, stir in the 
    <b>Tomatoes</b> (If stirred in at the same time as the Potatoes, 
    their acid will harden the Potatoes).
  <li>When the <b>Potatoes</b> are tender, fish out about 1/3 of them 
    and mash them. Return them to the pot and bring back to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> and turn the flame up high until up to a simmer. 
    Turn the heat down and give them 2 minutes simmer time, or however 
    long it takes to cook them through. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with chopped <b>Scallion Greens</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; You want a fish that stays reasonably 
  firm with wet cooking. I always test with Tilapia fillets, which are 
  marginal, but work well enough. For guests I'd almost always use 
  Golden Pompano or Japanese Amberjack (both can be used skin-on if 
  you like). If you buy whole fish, you can use them to make the stock 
  needed for this recipe (you'll need a little more than 2-1/2 pounds 
  of whole fish). For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes of 
  this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; If you have fillets but no stock, you 
  can use bottled Clam Juice. You could also make a stock using some 
  dried fish, often done in Asia, or you could use a couple tablespoons 
  of Thai Fish Sauce - but skip the salt if you do that.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I have restepped the pattern recipe for 
  practicality in my kitchen. It was already restepped from the 
  original Chinese restaurant method which cooked a whole fish - but 
  I kept the ingredients as in the pattern recipe.</li>
