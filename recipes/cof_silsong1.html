A mild but quite satisfying fish soup with interesting contrasts of 
textures and flavors. It should be liked even by guests who claim they 
don't like fish. If doing a double recipe, steam in two batches.

<b><u>Prep Fish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 15 min work)
<ol>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER</b> and wring out in a cloth to produce 1 T 
    <b>Ginger Juice</b>.  Mix with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Set up your steamer rig (see <a href="cof_silsong1x.html#gallery">
    <b>Photo Gallery</b></a>) and place <b>FISH FILLETS</b> on a rimmed 
    plate in a single layer. Set plate in the steamer and spread 
    <b>Ginger Juice mix</b> over the fish. Bring steamer to a boil 
    uncovered (to minimize condensaton in the plate), then cover it and 
    steam Fish until it flakes easily, 6 to 12 minutes depending on 
    fish. Discard liquids and let fish cool.</li>
  <li>When cool enough to handle, flake <b>Fish</b>, not too small.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>General Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut stems from <b>SHIITAKES</b>. Slice caps horizontally, one or 
    two cuts depending on thickness. Cut the slices into narrow 
    matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> similarly thin and into narrow 
    matchsticks short enough to fit in a soup spoon. Mix with 
    <b>Shiitakes</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HAM</b> into similar matchsticks. Keep separate.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and cut into narrow 
    matchsticks short enough to fit in a soup spoon. </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Thickener items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> for Garnish.</li>
  <li>Separate <b>EGGS</b> and beat the <b>WHITES</b> lightly.  Use the 
    Yolks for something else.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Bring <b>Stock</b> to a boil. Keep hot.</li>
  <li>In a heavy bottomed saucepan (5 quart is good), heat <b>Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Ginger</b>, stirring until aromatic. Stir in <b>Shiitake 
    mix</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat until Shiitake 
    matchsticks are softened.</li>
  <li>Pour in hot <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a simmer for about 3 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ham</b> and <b>Fish Flakes</b>. Bring back to a simmer 
    for about a minute.</li>
  <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Beat the <b>Egg Whites</b> a little 
    more, then pour through a wire sieve all over the surface of the 
    soup. Do not stir, just let the whites solidify.</li>
  <li>Move the pot back onto the heat and bring back to a simmer for 
    a minute.  Gently stir in the <b>Black Vinegar mix</b>. Stir 
    gently until the soup thickens.</li>
  <li>Check for <b>Salt</b> - for unsalted stock, about 1 t. If you 
    used water and Fish Sauce for the Stock, about 1/2 t.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  Grass Carp, but that may not be easy to find outside California. For 
  the photo example I used Tilapia, but other mild white fish could be 
  use, provided they flakes well. Tilapia is delicate, so steaming time 
  should be 7 minutes max. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">Varieties of Fish</a> page (very 
  large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shiitakes:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms 
  are best, but lacking those, you could use dried Shiitakes (Black 
  Mushrooms), soaked at least 3/4 hour in warm water and sliced into 
  very narrow matchsticks.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Canned Bamboo Shoots 
  are obsolete. The ones vacuum packed in plastic bags are much better, 
  and don't need to be par boiled to remove the tinny taste. I use 
  the small, wide "Green Bamboo Shoots" which are solid, and the right 
  size for slicing into matchsticks.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chinese Ham</h3> &nbsp; This is not common in 
  North America, but here in Los Angeles the Asian Markets carry slices 
  of dry cured Virginia Ham, which is considered a good substitute. 
  For the photo example I used the lean part of Italian Porchetta. If 
  pork is not acceptable, you could omit it, or break up a couple of 
  small dried scallops into the soup.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Black Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This rice vinegar 
  is available in most markets serving an East or Southeast Asian 
  community. That from Chinkiang is considered the best, and Gold 
  Plum is a good brand. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html">Sours</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; A light chicken stock would be 
  used in China, but a good light flavored Fish Stock could be used - 
  or plain water with a Tablespoon of Thai Fish Sauce works well.</li>
