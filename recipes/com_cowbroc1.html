An easy to make and satisfying soup. I don't guarantee it's ever been 
made in China - big colorful cookbooks from England seldom provide any 
background. I've corrected it to the right kind of broccoli so all the 
ingredients are authentic.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> 1/4 inch thick and cut into narrow strips about 
    1-1/2 inches long. Bring some water to a boil over high heat and stir 
    in the beef. When it's back to a boil strain out the beef and rinse it. 
    This is to keep the soup clear.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> slice and chop fine. Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> 
    small. Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into 
    <b>Beef</b>. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes or more, turning 
    a couple of times.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil over high heat and stir in 
    <b>Noodles</b> for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Quench with cold 
    running water, drain well and set aside. I generally make several 
    knife cuts through the bunch to cut the noodles to a length easier 
    to handle with a spoon (or you could provide chopsticks along with 
    the spoons).</li>
  <li>Strip leaves and tender flower heads from <b>BROCCOLI</b> , tear into 
    soup size fragments and set aside. Slice stems diagonally starting about 
    1/4 inch thick at the thick end and increasing to 1 inch at the thin end, 
    keeping them separate from the leaves.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>LEEK</b> thin, Slice <b>BABY CORN</b> diagonally about 3/8 
    inch thick and mix with the <b>Broccoli Stems</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Bring <b>Stock</b> to a boil. Stir in <b>Beef</b>, including its 
    marinade. Stir in <b>Broccoli Stems Mix</b>, bring to a boil and 
    simmer for about 8 minutes, then add the <b>Broccoli Leaves</b> and 
    simmer another 2 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Turn the heat up high and stir in <b>Noodles</b> and 
    <b>Chili Powder</b>. When back to boiling turn down to a simmer for 
    about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check <b>Salt</b> to taste (amount depends on saltiness of stock) 
    and Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These will be fresh thin yellow 
  Chinese "egg noodles" (which may have no egg, just yellow dye) found in 
  the refrigerated section of Asian markets. If you need to use dried, take 
  3-1/2 ounces  and soak them in warm water for about 20 minutes before the 
  first scalding. For more details see our page 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_chthinz.html"><b>Chinese Egg Noodles, 
  Thin</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Korean works well here. 
  For details see our
