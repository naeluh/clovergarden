Light, but capable of being a delicious main dish soup when served with rice 
(see <a href="com_fuzmel1.html#08"><b>Serving</b></a>). It reheats well, as gourd doesn't 
become mushy like squash.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min w/hand chopped pork)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> fine or grind. Massage in all <b>Marinade items</b> 
    and set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Smack with your kitchen mallet 
    to crush it moderately so it releases flavor easily. Toss in with Pork.
    </li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in hot water for at least 1/2 hour. Stem, and 
    Cut in half and slice at 90&deg; about 1/8 inch.</li>
  <li>Scrape <b>FUZZY MELON</b> (no need to peel, just take off the thin 
    dark green skin). Split lengthwise into quarters (or halves if small) 
    and cut into slices 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>SALTED "TURNIP"</b> well to reduce salt. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>TOFU</b> into cubes, about 1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGG</b> lightly.</li>
  <li>For Garnish: &nbsp;  Slice <b>SCALLION</b> thin crosswise. Chop 
    <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse. Mix
  </ol>  
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a large pan (4+ quarts), heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Pork</b> and 
    <b>Ginger</b> until Pork has completely lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b>, and <b>Salted "Turnip"</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, cover, and turn to a fast simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>. Bring back to a boil, cover and turn down 
    to a fast simmer until Fuzzy Melon is cooked through and looks translucent. 
    This will be about 12 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tofu</b>. Bring back to a boil, then turn to a very slow 
    simmer. While stirring in one direction. stream in <b>Egg</b> as for 
    Egg Flower Soup.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer another 2 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Scallion mix</b>. See also

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and after removing 
  any excess fat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid salted "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. 
  Sake is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; This is the dried Shiitakes available 
  everywhere. Presume fairly large ones. For the photo example, I had fresh 
  ones, but soaked them like dried to improve texture. I use 4 as they are 
  not as strong flavored as dried, and I used the soaking water as part of 
  the Stock, as it too is fairly light. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Gwa, Mo Qua, Moa Gua] &nbsp; Select a fresh looking 
  one that's about 1 pound, or two smaller ones. Suitable substitutes are 
  Opo Squash (Bottle Gourd) or Luffa Squash (a Gourd), ribbed (Chinese Okra) or 
  smooth (Sponge Luffa). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html"><b>Fuzzy Melon</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/gourds.html"><b>Gourds</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Salted "Turnip":</h3> &nbsp; "Turnip" on Asian packaging means 
  "Daikon Radish". The pattern recipe did not give a weight, and described 
  a packaging I've never seen in Los Angeles (the author lives in Silicon 
  Valley). It did give the option of leaves or slices. I used leaves from a 
  giant "Salted Turnip" I had in my fridge. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_daiprez.html"><b>Preserved Turnip 
  / Daikon Radish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe suggests 50% Chicken Stock 
  and 50% Water. I used that ratio, because the Chicken Stock on hand was 
  quite strong.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; The easiest way to serve this soup is to place a 
  bowl of steamed Jasmine Rice on the table to be spooned into the soup 
  as desired by the diners.</li>
