An simple soup that will delight porkophiles. It takes hours, but 
with little work or attention. The pork belly becomes soft 
and silky, the ham remains firm and the bamboo shoots remain crunchy. 
I have also included a <a href="com_pigdbl1.html#04"><b>Variation</b></a>, which I 
like even better.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK BELLY</b> into chunks about 3/4 inch wide and 1/2 
    inch thick by the width of the strip (usually about 1-1/2 inches). 
    Cut narrower if your strip is wider.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HAM</b> into pieces about the same size as the Pork belly.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> about 1/4 inch thick and in size about  
    the same as the Pork Belly, or a little smaller.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GINGER</b> into a couple thick slices, skin on, and strike 
    lightly with your Kitchen Mallet, just enough to loosen it up.
    Mix with Bamboo.</li> 
  <li>Cut off <b>SCALLION WHITES</b> and crush lightly to loosen them 
    up. Mix with Bamboo. Reserve the Greens for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a 3 quart saucepan, place the <b>Pork Belly</b>  and pour in 
    water to cover. Bring to a boil for about 2 minutes. Dump it out 
    into a clean sink and rinse well. Clean the sauce pan.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Pork Belly</b> to the cleaned pan, along with <b>Ham</b> 
    and 6 cups of cold <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, skimming if 
    necessary.</li>
  <li>Put <b>All Remaining Items</b> in a in the pan. Bring back to 
    a light boil for about 3 minutes. Set to a simmer and simmer covered 
    for about 2-1/2 to 3 hours. The Ham has probably provided enough 
    salt, but check.</li>
  <li> Cut some <b>Scallion Greens</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Scallion Greens</b></li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; This must be "skin on", the way it's most 
  commonly sold in Asian markets here in Southern California.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ham:</h3> &nbsp; Chinese Hams are not allowed to be imported into 
  North America or most of Europe. Consequently, Fuchsia Dunlop calls 
  for Gammon, a kind of ham in England, but not anywhere else. Some 
  Chinese style ham is made in California, but not widely distributed. 
  In Los Angeles, Asian markets sell slabs of Virginia style Picnic 
  Hams for use by Chinese cooks, but this may not be available to you 
  either. Just select a high quality regular smoked ham from a deli, 
  it'll work fine. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_hams.html">
  <b>Hams</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh are always best, but not always 
  available even here in Los Angeles, and they need preparation, then 
  a 20 minute simmer to drive off the cyanide. If possible use those now 
  widely available in sterile shrink bags. Canned must have a short 
  boil to remove the tinny taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html"><b>Bamboo Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variation:</h3> &nbsp; This soup was quite fine. yet seemed to me 
  just a little lacking as given. I had some leftover Shanghai Bok Choy, 
  so I cut some up, stirred it in and simmered for a few minutes before 
  serving (see <a href="com_pigdbl1x.html#gal"><b>Gallery</b></a>). 
  Until someone presents convincing evidence that nobody in Shanghai 
  has ever added Shanghai Bok Choy to Shanghai Double Pork Soup, I'm 
  calling it "authentic".</li>
