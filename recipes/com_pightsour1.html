Unlike many, this hot &amp; sour soup is made hot with pepper (black or 
white) rather than chilis. Pepper was widely used in China before the 
barbarians (that's us) brought chili peppers. Lots of ingredients, but 
easy to make.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into very narrow strips. Mix all <b>Marinade 
    items</b>, massage into Pork and set aside.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>DRIED MUSHROOMS</b> in hot water for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Cut soaked <b>Dried Mushrooms</b>, <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b>, 
    <b>WHITE MUSHROOMS</b> and <b>HAM</b> into narrow strips. Mix.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and cut into slivers.</li>
  <li>Slice green part of <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin and place in your 
    serving bowl. Drizzle with <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Rice Wine</b>, <b>Light Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Dark Soy 
    Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with cold <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> or <b>Oil</b> very hot. Stir in <b>Ginger</b> for 
    about 30 seconds, then stir in <b>Mushroom mix</b> and fry stirring for 
    a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in <b>Wine mix</b> 
    and season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. The pepper should be 
    very distinct but not overwhelming. I find 1 t of fresh ground about 
    right.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork strips</b> and cook until about done.</li>
  <li><u>Caution:</u> start stirring in the <b>Cornstarch mix</b> a little 
    at a time and stop when you achieve the right consistency. It should be 
    glossy but remain soupy, not gunky.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat and slowly stir in <b>Vinegar</b> until you get the 
    sourness you want - it should not be overwhelming.</li>
  <li>Pour soup into the serving bowl over the <b>Scallions</b> and serve 
    immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or vacuum bagged are best, but 
  canned can be used. Blanch canned shoots in boiling water for a 
  minute to refresh.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ham</h3> &nbsp; This should be dry cured "country style" (Virginia 
  or similar) if at all possible (for all Chinese recipes). Chinese 
  markets around here sell single slices of Virginia ham in shrink 
  wrapped trays. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_hams.html"><b>Hams</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard or Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Lard, the traditionl 
  cooking medium in Thiland and southern China, was so vilianized by the 
  American Heart Association that Americans are still afraid to use it. 
  It is far safer than the trans fats they told us to use instead, and 
  has a better health profile than butter. If, however, you are not 
  comfortable using it, Pure Olive Oil (not virgin) is a good substitute. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; In China, white pepper is 
  generally used (they don't like black specks) which has the hotness 
  but not the flavor of black pepper. Personally, I use the black anyway, 
  but this soup is so dark it doesn't matter.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Black Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Chinkiang is considered 
  best. Gold Plum is a good brand that's widely available. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
