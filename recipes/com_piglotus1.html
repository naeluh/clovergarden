A nice simple soup with impressively exotic lotus roots. The lotus tastes 
similar to potato but remains very firm, almost crisp.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>SPARE RIBS</b> and cut into 1 inch to 1-1/2 inch 
    lengths. A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is perfect for this job. Put the ribs in a pot of water and bring to 
    a boil. Drain and rinse the ribs, discarding the water.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>LOTUS ROOT</b>, slice about 3/4 inch thick and cut into bite 
    size chunks. If using pre-sliced lotus root just cut in half or quarters 
    depending on size.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Put all <b>Soup items</b> in a pot and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 
    around 2 hours, adding water as needed.</li>
  <li> Cut green part of <b>SCALLIONS</b> into slivers.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, garnish with 
    <b>Scallions</b> and serve hot. If using ribs, see there's a bone 
    bowl on the table.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing 
  any excess fat. This recipe is also made with pork belly - tasty but 
  fattier. If using pork belly use about 10 ounces, cook about an hour 
  and a half, and you may want to defat the stock before serving.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lotus Root:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with inedible 
  joints and ends cut away but before peeling. Fresh lotus root can be 
  found in many markets serving East and Southeast Asian communities. 
  It can also often be found peeled, sliced, par boiled and vacuum 
  packed in the refrigerated section. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/pr_lotusz.html"><b>Lotus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; In China they generally use 
  white pepper which has the hotness but not the flavor of black pepper. 
  Personally, I use the black anyway, but then, I'm one of those 
  despised barbarians.</li>
