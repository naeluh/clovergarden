This soup presents wonderful flavors and textures you may not have 
experienced before. Soups of this pattern are typical of the Shanghai 
region. Shepherds Purse is the usual green (see <a href="com_pigspn1.html#06">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and cut into thin slivers.</li> 
  <li>Remove most stems from <b>SPINACH</b> and weigh just leaves. drain well, or use a salad spinner. 
    </li> 
  <li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Stir in spinach just 
    until wilted, well under 1 minute. Refresh in cold water. Squeeze 
    dry and chop as fine as you can.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SILKEN TOFU</b> into dice a little less than 1/4 inch on a 
    side.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Potato Starch</b> with <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
  </ol>  
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> over high flame and fry <b>Pork</b>, 
    stirring until all strands are separate and it has completely lost 
    its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice Wine</b>, then <b>Stock</b> and <b>Tofu</b>. 
    Bring to a boil. Stir in <b>Spinach</b> and bring back to a 
    boil.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir up <b>Potato Starch</b> slurry. Stir it into the soup a bit 
    at a time, keeping the soup at a strong simmer. Don't over-do it -  
    stop when the soup has a silky texture and the Tofu and Pork are 
    suspended.</li>
  <li><u>IF using</u>: Stir in <b>Lard</b> or rendered <b>Chicken Fat</b> 
    just before serving..</li>
  <li>Serve hot</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and after removing any excess 
  fat.  Yellow Croaker or strands of Crab or Scallops can be used instead 
  of the pork.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for trimmed leaves 
  with most stems removed. For regular spinach you will need at least 
  a 10 ounce bunch to yield 6 ounces. The photo example used Taiwan 
  Spinach, which has huge leaves and huge but very tender, flavorful 
  stems, so more stems can be included. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ch_spinachz.html">Spinach</a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; A clear Chicken Stock would 
  be expected in the Shanghai region.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Finish:</h3> &nbsp; In many hard working cultures, 
  soups are finished with some sort of oil. For this soup, Lard or 
  rendered Chicken Fat would be used. While "authentic", this is rarely 
  done in more modern cultures where the extra calories are not 
  appreciated so much.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Shepherds purse is a common vegetable in the 
  Shanghai region and surrounding, but is not grown commercially in North 
  America. While a common weed here, the wild variety is not leafy enough 
  to gather. Shepherds Purse is in the mustard family, so possibly Small 
  Gai Lan could also be a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#loose">Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip 
  &amp; Radish Greens</a> page.</li>
