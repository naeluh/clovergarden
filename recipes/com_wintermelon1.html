liquid, and pork (though some use chicken). See also <a href="com_wintermelon1.html#03">

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in a cup of warm water for about 35 min, then 
    squeeze them out, <u>keeping soaking liquid</u> and slice into 1/4 in 
    squares.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>WINTER MELON</b> with a vegetable peeler, just enough to 
    remove the hard green. Cut it into 1/2 in cubes (not larger).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into 1/2 in cubes, removing any remaining fat. Put 
    in a pot with plenty of water and bring to a rolling boil for 1 
    minute. Dump out into a clean sink, clean the pot and rinse all 
    sludge off the pork.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and cut into narrow matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>GARNISH</b>, as many listed items as you have. Slice 
    Scallions very thin on a diagonal, separate Cilantro leaves. Set out 
    Sesame Oil some way so you can dispense just a few drops into each 
    bowl. Keep bean sprouts fresh and crisp.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min to 2 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Put <b>Mushroom soaking liquid</b> and enough more water to make up 
    6 cups in a pot. Add <b>Mushrooms</b>, <b>Pork</b>, <b>Ginger</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a simmer and simmer covered until pork is tender 
    (20 minutes to 1-1/2 hours depending on cut - longest for ribs).</li>
  <li>Add <b>Winter Melon</b> and continue to simmer until melon is just 
    cooked through (about 15 minutes - it will become translucent and settle 
    deeper in the water).</li> 
  <li>Ladle into serving bowels. Stir just a few drops of <b>Sesame Oil</b> 
    into each bowl and add a dash of each garnish (don't overdo it). Serve 
    hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; These are available, usually as large 
  wedges or slices, in just about any market serving a Southeast Asian 
  or Chinese community, and sometimes in Indian markets. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html">Ash Gourd</a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless pork with 
  all fat removed. Spare ribs are sometimes used, separated and cut into 
  1 inch lengths (a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced 
  mallet is perfect for this). For ribs increase weight to 1 pound, 
  and cooking time to 1-1/2 hrs.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  Some use broth instead of water in this 
  recipe, and quite a few add dried scallops, or, in Vietnam dried tiger 
  lily buds.</li>
