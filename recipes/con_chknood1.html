A very popular soup and adaptable to what you have on hand. In the photo 
the noodles are a bit green because they're wormwood (mugwort) flavored 
noodles from a Korean market.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> 30 minutes in warm water. Stem and shred.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil over high flame, 
    sprinkle <b>NOODLES</b> into the water and stir well to separate 
    strands. When the water comes back to a boil, turn the heat down a 
    bit and let it boil for another 4 minutes. Strain out the noodles 
    and rinse them well with cold water so they don't stick (Chinese way) 
    or tumble them with a few drops of oil (my way). Drain and set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Shred <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> and mix with <b>Mushrooms</b>.</li>
  <li>If using raw <b>CHICKEN</b> cut into slivers and parboil 2 minutes. 
    Drain and set aside. If cooked, just tear it into shreds (see 
    <a href="con_chknood1.html#02">Note-2</a>).</li>
  <li>Shred <b>HAM</b> and add to Chicken.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a heavy bottomed pot and stir in 
    <b>Mushroom mix</b>. Fry stirring for a couple of minutes. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Rice Wine</b>, then  <b>Stock</b> 
    and <b>Salt</b>.  Bring to a boil and simmer 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken mix</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer 5 minutes 
    (less if using cooked chicken).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Noodles</b> and simmer until done - 2 to 5 minutes depending 
    on the noodles.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with both spoons and chopsticks (for handling the noodles). 
    Use tongs to transfer noodles to individual bowls, then a ladle for 
    the liquid.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh noodles can be made at home or found in 
  the refrigerated section of Asian markets and some supermarkets.  I 
  avoid those dyed yellow for soup. I've had good luck with the fairly 
  firm hanks sold in Korean markets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is for 
  boneless uncooked. In China cooked chicken would likely be used. If 
  you have cooked chicken use 5 ounces and tear it into shreds.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Ham:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese prefer dry cure 
  (Virginia / country) ham, because it's close to what they use in China. 
  Asian markets sell it in individual thick slices but its not much 
  available in supermarkets. I have used the lean part from smoked 
  bacon ends and pieces, cut up smoked sausages and regular ham, all 
  with good results. The photo example was made with smoked sausages.
