A creamy textured soup, simple but intersting as a side or intro course. 
It's less suitable as a main course soup and a little thick for a finish 
soup (soup is often served at the end of a meal in China).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Taro Roots:</h3> &nbsp; This would be for common 
  taro roots weighing 3 or 4 ounces each. these are easy to find in 
  markets serving any tropical community. Giant taro would have to be 
  cubed. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_taroz.html"><b>Taro Roots</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; A light chicken stock would be 
  normal, but pork or vegetable would also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Watercress:</h3> &nbsp; In Hunan, tender young Asian 
  radish leaves (wa wa) would be used. &Uuml;ber expert Fuchsia Dunlop 
  suggests watercress because most Americans don't have Asian radishes 
  growing in the back yard. Of course, I live near a Korean market that 
  carries tiny radishes with tender leaves, but you probably don't.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese don't like 
  little black specs, so they use White Pepper. Black Pepper has more 
  flavor, and that's what I use, but then I'm one of those despised 
  barbarians.</li>
