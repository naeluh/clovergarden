Chrysanthemum leaves are an ingeredient not familiar to most in North 
America, but worthwhile getting acquainted with. It will also work with 
other greens, and see also <a href="cov_tongho1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Straw Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These should be 
  "Unpeeled" and the amount given ia about  1-1/2 15 oz cans. If they are 
  at just the right stage of development they'll look like little alien 
  happy faces when cut in half lengthwise. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/fu_strawz.html">Straw Mushrooms</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tong Ho:</h3> &nbsp; This comes in two varieties, 
  "small leaf" with frilly leaves - very common in Asian markets, and 
  "big leaf" - still rare even in Los Angeles. The big leaf is preferred 
  for soup but the small leaf will work well enough. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/dy_tonghz.html">Chrysanthemum</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock</h3> &nbsp; The original recipe specifies 
  plain water, but I suspect she used fresh straw mushrooms not canned, 
  so I specify a light stock for more flavor. Fresh straw mushrooms are 
  pretty much unavailable even in Los Angeles, never mind Cleveland.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The author of the original recipe 
  specified Olive Oil, and since she's a Chinese person living in Hong 
  Kong that makes it "authentic". I completely agree, it is the best 
  cooking oil for almost all cuisines - but it should be plain 
  "Olive Oil" (also known as "Pure Olive Oil"), not Virgin, which has 
  too much flavor of its own.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some shrimp or other shellfish would be a 
  welcom addition. Personally, I'd put in a dash of fish sauce and a 
  couple Thai chilis - which would make it more Vietnamese.</li>
