Essential to Hunan cooking, this distinctive seasoning and condiment is 
easy to make. I also mash it up to use for Sichuan pickled chili paste and 
other applications calling for Sichuan pickled chili.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Fresno Chilis are the hot red ripe chili of 
  choice in all the ethnic markets in Southern California. Apparently 
  they are so widely satisfactory no others are being marketed, though 
  many varieties of green chilis are. Of course many tons of red ripe 
  jalapenos are also grown but I think every last one goes to Huy Fong 
  Foods for their famous sauces. Jalapenos are less authentic in 
  flavor anyway. For more information see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt</h3> &nbsp; Only <u>natural</u> sea salt 
  should be used for salt pickling. I emphasize "natural", because many 
  major brands of "sea salt" are highly refined. If it doesn't seem a 
  little moist, it's not natural. Various pundits tell you that "salt 
  is salt, it's nearly all sodium chloride", but some of the trace salts 
  in sea salt are very important to proper fermentation. Of course you 
  can buy sea salt from gourmet outlets for astounding prices, but if 
  you find a Korean market you can buy big sacks of it for very little.
