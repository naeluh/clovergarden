These dried fermented greens were originally food for the poor, used to 
flavor bland vegetables or make soup broth. Today they are at the heart 
of Shaoxing and Shanghai cuisine, used in thousands of ways.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 	(45 min + 7 to 10 days)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate the leaves of the <b>MUSTARD GREENS</b> and float wash. 
    Dry well, preferably in a salad spinner. You can cut very large 
    stems in half so they fit well.</li>
  <li>Thread the <b>Greens</b> on a string passing through the stems, 
    not too tight together, and hang up indoors overnight to wilt (or 
    see <a href="cpv_grnfms1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Unstring the <b>Greens</b> and cut them crosswise into 2 inch 
    pieces. Thick stems should be sliced thin lengthwise. Put them all 
    in a large mixing bowl.</li>  
  <li>Sprinkle with <b>Sea Salt</b> and massage it in hard, as if you 
    were kneading stiff bread dough. Massage until the salt is thoroughly 
    incorporated and the leaves look wet as they start to exude their 
    liquid. Let it rest for 15 minutes and then massage some more</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Greens</b> in a sterile jar (3 cups size), including any 
    liquid already exuded. Ram them down tight so all air is excluded 
    (see <a href="cpv_grnfms1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Their liquid should cover the 
    top of the greens when rammed down an hour later. Cover tightly and 
    set aside at a cool (but not cold) room temperature. Open the jar 
    daily so pressure won't build up, and ram the greens down again to 
    eliminate gas and wash the top layer in brine.</li>
  <li>The greens are done when they have a satisfying sour-savory 
    taste. You may notice a reduction in the amount of gas being 
    generated at this time. A week is about average, but exact time 
    will depend on room temperature.</li>
  <li>On a bright sunny day, spread out trays, bamboo preferred, but 
    otherwise solid trays covered by a dish towel. Drain the greens 
    and Spread them out on the tray, untangling lumps. Set them in 
    direct sunlight and turn now and then for even drying. Bring in 
    during the night. Several days of bright sun should do the job 
    (or see <a href="cpv_grnfms1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mustard Greens:</h3> &nbsp;  Mizuna (<i>xue li hong</i>) is most 
  often used in China, but is difficult to find and expensive in North 
  America. Small Gai Choy, which is easily available here in Los Angeles, 
  works well for this recipe, but other Asian mustard greens could be 
  used. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia">Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip
  & Radish Greens</a> page, particularly the Asian Greens section.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Natural</u> sea salt 
  should be used for salt pickling. I emphasize "natural", because many 
  major brands of "sea salt" are highly refined. If it doesn't seem a 
  little moist, it's not natural. Various pundits tell you that "salt 
  is salt, it's nearly all sodium chloride", but some of the minor salts 
  in sea salt are important to proper fermentation. Of course you can 
  buy sea salt from gourmet outlets for astounding prices, but if you 
  find a Korean market you can buy big sacks of it for very little. 
  Koreans do a whole lot of salt fermenting, and know what's best.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/salt.html">Salt</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Drying:</h3> Threading on string and hanging 
  overnight indooors is recommended by Fuchsia Dunlop. For the similar 
  Snow Vegetable, she mentions that many people dry half a day in the 
  sun, hung up on string or spread out on bamboo trays, but she's based 
  in London where they don't have sun. The object here is not to get any 
  actual dryness, but to get the right balance of water and salt. For 
  the photo specimens, I dried them in my electric dehydrator, fan on 
  and just warm for 1 hour until lightly wilted. It's a 5 tray Waring 
  and has just enough room for 2 pounds of greens, if I do the cutting 
  before drying rather than after.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickling:</h3> &nbsp; Make sure all containers and tools used are 
  sterile, and totally free of oil or fat. The amount of salt is fairly 
  critical. Ideally, these greens should be packed in a small crock, 
  covered by a fitted plate with a heavy weight on top, and a cloth 
  covering. If you don't have the crock, use a 3 cup wide mouth jar. 
  I have found that ramming the greens back down once or twice a day 
  so the top layer is well washed with the brine works to suppress mold.
  Another way is to fill a strong plastic bag with water, seal it 
  tightly and force it into the jar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Drying:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than sun drying, I use the same 
  electric dehydrator as used for the initial wilting. Set fan-on and 
  low or moderate temperature (depending on room temperature) It is done 
  in about 12 hours.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Yield</h3> &nbsp; Two pounds of greens makes 2 ounces fermented 
  and dried - a low yield, but most recipes call for well under 1 ounce.
