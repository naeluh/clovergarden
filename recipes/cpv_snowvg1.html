This mild pickle and its juice are used in many recipes from the 
Shanghai region (Zhejiang), but "Snow Vegetable" is hard to find 
even in the Asian markets of Los Angeles, but it's easy to make.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 	(30 min + 7 to 10 days)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate the leaves of the <b>MUSTARD GREENS</b> and float wash. 
    Dry well, preferably in a salad spinner. At this point I cut a "V" 
    at the base of the leaves to remove the thick white part for use in 
    another recipe.</li>
  <li>Wilt the <b>Greens</b> by one of the methods suggested in 
   <a href="cpv_snowvg1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> to achieve the right balance between 
   salt and liquid.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Greens</b> crosswise into 1/2 inch strips, stems into 
    about 3/4 inch pieces. If leaves are very wide you can make a couple 
    lengthwise cuts before cutting crosswise. Put them in a large mixing 
    bowl.</li>  
  <li>Sprinkle with 1 Tablespoon <b>Sea Salt</b> and massage it in hard, 
    as if you were kneading stiff bread dough. Massage until the salt 
    is thoroughly incorporated and the leaves look wet as they start to 
    exude their liquid. Let it rest for 15 minutes and then massage 
    some more</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Greens</b> in a sterile container and ram them down tight 
    so all air is excluded and their liquid covers the top of the greens 
    (it may take an hour for there to be that much liquid). Weight it 
    down so the leaves are completely covered (see <a href="cpv_snowvg1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>). Cover and set aside at a cool (but not cold) 
    room temperature.</li>
  <li>The greens are done when they have a satisfying sour-savory 
    taste. A week is about average, but exact time will depend on room 
    temperature. When the flavor is good, refrigerate. It will keep 
    for about two months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Weight</h3> is for greens actually going into the recipe. The 
  "official" green in the Shanghai region is Mizuna (<i>xue li hong</i>), 
  the true "snow vegetable". It's a turnip green (B.rapa), not a mustard 
  green (B.juncia), but it isn't reliably available in North America, 
  and very expensive if you can find it. I use Small Gai Choy (Large 
  Gai Choy is too stemmy), an actual mustard green easily available in 
  Los Angeles. For the 1-1/4 pounds for this recipe I bought 3-1/2 pounds 
  of Small Gai Choy. I cut out the thick white leaf bases for use in 
  another recipe. Some overseas Chinese chefs, with none of these 
  available, use radish greens. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip 
  & Radish Greens</b></a> page, particularly the Asian Greens section.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Natural</u> sea salt should be used for 
  salt pickling. I emphasize "natural", because many major brands of 
  "sea salt" are highly refined. If it doesn't seem a little moist, it's 
  not natural. Various pundits tell you that "salt 
  is salt, it's nearly all sodium chloride", but the Koreans, who do 
  far more salt pickling than anyone else, maintain that some of the 
  minor salts in sea salt are important to proper fermentation. Of course 
  you can buy sea salt from gourmet outlets for astounding prices, but 
  if you find a Korean market you can buy big sacks of it economically. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/salt.html"><b>Salt</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Wilting:</h3> Threading a string through the strongest points and 
  hanging overnight indoors is recommended by Fuchsia Dunlop. She 
  mentions that many people in China dry half a day in the sun, hung up 
  on string or spread out on bamboo trays, but she's based in London 
  where they don't have sun. The object here is not to get any actual 
  dryness, but to wilt for the right balance of water and salt. For the 
  photo specimens, I was pressed for time, so I dried them in my electric 
  dehydrator, fan on and low temperature, for about 1 hour, until lightly 
  wilted. It would be much faster at medium temperature, but would take 
  more attention to prevent over drying.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickling:</h3> &nbsp; Note that the amount of salt is fairly 
  critical. Ideally, these greens should be packed in a small crock, 
  covered by a fitted plate with a heavy weight on top, and a cloth 
  covering. Another way is to use a wide mouth jar with a fair amount 
  of headroom. a small, tightly sealed plastic bag full of water can 
  be stuffed into the jar to hold the contents down. If none of this 
  is possible, I have found that ramming the greens back down once 
  or twice a day so the top layer is well washed with the brine 
  works fine to suppress mold.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is based on one by &uuml;ber 
  expert Fuchsia Dunlop, who approves Small Gai Lan as a substitute for 
  Zhejiang Mizuna (see <a href="cpv_snowvg1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
