In China, fried rice is a snack or street food, not served at dinner 
where its flavors could interfere with flavors of other dishes - but  
we barbarians can do whatever we please. This recipe can be a light main 
dish for two.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>RICE</b> well, and cook with the minimum amount of water 
    needed. Grains should be separate, but cooked fully through. 
    Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>FEATURE</b> into small pieces - no larger than 1/2 inch on a 
    side for soft mild items like Shrimp, smaller for hard or stronger 
    items like Chinese Sausage.</li> 
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> lightly with 1/4 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin crosswise.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Fluff the <b>Rice</b> as best you can.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> over 
    moderate heat. Pour in <b>Feature</b> and fry stirring until just 
    cooked through if raw, or thoroughly heated if not. Scoop out with 
    a slotted spoon leaving all oil in the pan.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Eggs</b>. As they solidify, tilt the pan towards you. 
    Push the solids up away from you while the liquid drains toward you 
    until the eggs are no longer runny but soft and fluffy. Scoop them out
    into a dish using a slotted spoon.</li>
  <li>Add 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> and distribute it well. Pour <b>Rice</b>, 
    into the pan and toss it about over moderate heat until well heated 
    and all lumps are broken up.</li>
  <li>Stir in 2/3 t <b>Salt</b> and the <b>Scallions</b> until well 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Feature</b> and <b>Eggs</b>. Stir and break up 
    the eggs until they are in small pieces and everything is evenly 
    distributed and heated.</li>
  <li>In some regions (Cantonese) a little soy sauce is stirred in at 
    finish. Fried rice can be reheated, either in the oven or back in 
    the pan.</li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; 12 ounces is about 2 cups loosely packed. 1 cup 
  raw rice makes about 17 ounces cooked. This should be long grain 
  rice, completely cold, preferably made a day or two ahead and 
  refrigerated. This changes its starch composition for easier frying. 
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Feature:</h3> &nbsp; These are the items a fried 
  rice dish is named for. You can use just one, or two that complement 
  each other, generally one mild and one strong. Small amounts of other 
  items can be included. If you are using the fried rice as a light main 
  dish, you can up the Feature to 6 or even 8 ounces.
  <ul>
  <li>Shrimp: &nbsp; cut crosswise in 1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Celery: &nbsp; thin end of stalks sliced crosswise 1/8 inch or thinner.</li>
  <li>Chinese Sausage: &nbsp; cut into cubes no more than a quarter inch.</li>
  <li>Chicken: &nbsp; raw or roasted, cut into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Duck: &nbsp; roasted cut into 1/3 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Pork: &nbsp; raw or roasted, cut into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Beef: &nbsp; roasted cut into 1/3 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Ham: &nbsp; baked.</li>
  <li>Bamboo Shoots; &nbsp; sliced thin and cut into narrow strips.</li>
  <li>Bean Sprouts: &nbsp; blanched (skip frying step).</li>
  <li>Green Peas: &nbsp; parboiled if fresh, thawed if frozen.</li>
  <li>Bell Peppers: &nbsp; diced about 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Green Beans: &nbsp; parboiled and cut 1/2 inch long.</li>
  <li>Tofu, pressed: &nbsp; cut into dice.</li>
  <li>Sichuan Vegetable: &nbsp; sliced and cut into narrow stirps.</li>
  <li>Mushrooms: &nbsp; fresh or canned slice medium. If dried, soak at least 
    1/2 hour in warm water and cut fairly small (not too many of these).</li>
  <li>Water Chestnuts: &nbsp; sliced medium.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media in China is 
  Lard, and, if you use it, you will have a lot <u>less trouble with 
  rice sticking</u> to the pan. Lard has a health profile better than 
  butter, and is far and away better for you than the trans fats and 
  denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has told you to use. Do render your 
  own lard though, it's easy. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
