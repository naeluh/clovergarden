In China, fried rice is a snack or street food, not served at dinner 
where its flavors could interfere with flavors of other dishes - but  
we barbarians can do whatever we please. This recipe can be a light main 
dish for two.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Cook <b>RICE</b> with the minimum amount of water needed. Grains 
    should be separate, but cooked fully through. Refrigerate for 8 hours 
    or overnight. This changes the starch composition of the rice, (see  
   <a href="csg_ricefry2.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>With a thin sharp Santoko or similar knife, cut raw <b>CASHEWS</b> 
    into 2 or 3 pieces depending on size.  Dry pan roast them over fairly 
    high heat, turning almost constantly, until they have a lot of medium 
    brown spots and edges. A pan temperature of 440&deg;F/225&deg;C is 
    as high as you should go. This will take about 8 minutes. Stop eating 
    them!</li>
  <li>With scissors, cut <b>NORI</b> sheets into about 3/8 inch square 
    flakes.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> lightly with 1/4 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Fluff the <b>Rice</b> as best you can.</li>
  <li>In a wok, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> over medium-high heat. Pour in 
    <b>Eggs</b>. As they solidify, tilt the pan towards you. Push the 
    solids up away from you while the liquid drains toward you, until 
    the eggs are no longer runny but soft and fluffy. Scoop them out
    into a dish using a slotted spoon.</li>
  <li>Add 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> and distribute it well. Pour the fluffed 
    <b>Rice</b> into the pan and toss it about over moderate heat until 
    well heated and all lumps are broken up.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and <b>Nori</b>. Continue tumbling the 
    rice until the Nori starts to break up.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cashews</b> and toss everything together until evenly 
    distributed. </li>
  <li>Garnish with a light sprinkling of salt and 1 t Sesame Oil.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.  Fried rice can be reheated, either in the oven or back 
    in the pan.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; A long grain rice like Thai Jasmine is good for 
  Fried Rice. 2 cups raw makes 2 pounds 2 ounces cooked - 2 cups lightly 
  packed is about 12 ounces. The rice should be well washed, then cooked 
  fairly dry so when the grains are cooked through they are still quite
  separate. The rice must be fully cold, preferably refrigerated 
  overnight, which changes its starch composition.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cashews:</h3> &nbsp; Raw Cashews pan roasted like 
  this have both flavor and texture considerably different from 
  commercially roasted cashews. In China, pan toasted Pine Nuts might 
  be used instead of Cashews.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Nori Sheets:</h3> &nbsp; [Laver] Standard sheets 
  of paper thin Nori seaweed are about 7-1/2 x 8 inches. 7 sheets weigh 
  about 5/8 ounce. They are available in most Asian markets, particularly 
  those serving Japanese and Korean communities. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/algae.html#red"><b>Seaweed</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media in China is 
  Lard, and, if you use it, you will have a lot <u>less trouble with 
  rice sticking</u> to the pan. Lard has a health profile better than 
  butter, and is far and away better for you than the trans fats and 
  denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has told you to use. Do render your 
  own lard though, it's easy. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
