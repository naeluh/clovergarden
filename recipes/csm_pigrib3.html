  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths less about 2 inches. 
    A sharp Chinese cleaver knife is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Tumble coat <b>Pork Ribs</b> well with <b>Cornstarch</b> and shake off 
    any that's loose. This cornstarch helps with browning and thickens the 
    sauce so it coats well.</li>
  <li>In a coverable wok or saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> enough for deep 
    frying and, in two batches, fry <b>Pork Ribs</b> over very high heat 
    until lightly browned and crisp on the surface (they won't be cooked 
    through yet). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well.</li>
  <li>Pour the oil from the pan and pour in the <b>Sauce Mix</b>. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer for a couple minutes, then add <b>Pork Ribs</b>. 
    Bring back to a boil, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes turning 
    over a couple times for even coating and making sure it doesn't run 
    out of liquid. Actually, I tend to simmer these about an hour to 
    soften the cartilege to edible - great source of calcium and good 
    for joints.</li>
  <li>After simmering, uncover the pan. If the sauce is still too 
    liquid to properly coat the ribs keep at a high simmer until it's 
    thickened, tumbling the ribs occasionally.</li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ketchup</h3> &nbsp; This condiment originated in 
  China. It wasn't made from tomatoes because they didn't have tomatoes, 
  but the tomato variety is used there now.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Juice:</h3> &nbsp; You probably don't want 
  to open a can for just 2 T. Take a hunk of very ripe tomato, peel off 
  the skin, chop it a bit and pound into juice in your mortar.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chinkiang Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; This is a dark 
  rice vinegar. If you don't have it use regular rice vinegar.</li>
