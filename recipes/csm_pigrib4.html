Mildly spicy ribs cooked quickly. There's enough sauce made by this recipe 
so it will go well with long grain rice. It reheats ok but the bell 
peppers will be soft.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths of 2 inches or less 
    depending on your preference. A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
    by a soft faced mallet is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> and 2 T <b>Water</b> and tumble with ribs to 
    coat. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> into largish pieces, about 1 inch by 2 
    inches. Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 2 inch lengths, mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Mix with <b>Black Bean Chili Sauce</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a coverable wok or saut&eacute; pan heat enough <b>Oil</b> to 
    fry <b>Pork Ribs</b> (do in two or three batches). Fry stirring over 
    high heat until lightly browned (they won't be cooked quite through 
    yet). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well. Be careful not to 
    burn the cornstarch that sticks to the pan.</li>
  <li>Pour out the oil from the pan leaving 1 T. Bring back hot over 
    medium heat and stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b>. Fry stirring about 
    30 seconds, then stir in <b>Bell Peppers</b> and fry stirring another 
    30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Pork Ribs</b> and fry stirring another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 
    about 5 minutes stirring occasionally until ribs are cooked through.
    </li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Ribs:</h3> These are cooked for a rather short 
  time so I suggest Baby Back Ribs which are more uniform than spare ribs, 
  or select just the bone parts of a side of spare ribs and cut any very 
  thick ones into bone and meat halves (every piece doesn't have to have 
  a bone in it). Save the thick cartelage stiffened pieces for a longer 
  cooking dish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> One red and one green is visually 
  preferable but both red or both green is fine too.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Vineger:</h3> This is a red rice vinegar often 
  used for dips in China. If you don't have it white rice vinegar will 
  work fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Bean Chili Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This can 
  be purchased in jars, but you can also make it yourself. See our 
  recipe
