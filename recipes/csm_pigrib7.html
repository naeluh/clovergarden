An excellent deeply flavorful appetizer or meat side dish, easy to make 
too. I use my 13" wok for the whole process, washing it between steps. 
The frying step could be omitted, but the flavor would be less 
intense.

  <ol>
  <li>Remove all excess fat from the <b>PORK RIBS</b> (before weighing), 
    separate them and cut into lengths of about 1-1/2 inches. 
    A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet is 
    perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Pork Ribs</b> in a pot with plenty of <b>Water</b> and bring 
    to a boil over high heat. Let boil for around 3 minutes, pour out 
    into a clean sink and rinse.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Garlic</b> and chop fine. Mix together all 
    <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Pork Ribs</b> in a pot with <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring 
    to a boil. Simmer covered 45 minutes. Remove ribs and retain cooking 
    liquid.</li>
  <li>In a wok or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Pork 
    Ribs</b> stiring until lightly browned all over. This will not take 
    long.</li>
  <li>Add reserved <b>Cooking Liquid</b> and cook over moderate heat 
    until a sauce forms that coats the ribs well.</li>
  <li>Serve ribs hot with sauce poured over.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing 
  all excess fat, but with bone and cartilage in.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Bean Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Made from chilis, 
  fermented (black) soybeans and oil, it's available in markets serving 
  a Chinese or Southeast Asian community - but it's easty to mix up your 
  own <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/cjv_blkbnchili1.html"><b>Black Bean Chili Paste</b></a>. 
  Other chili sauces could be used with some change of flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional  
  frying medium through Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary 
  and Poland. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats they told us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you 
  still don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or Avocado 
  Oil for richer flavor.</li>
