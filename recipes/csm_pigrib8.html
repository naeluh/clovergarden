  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>PORK RIBS</b>, separate ribs and cut 
    into lengths about 2 inches. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife 
    driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Massage all <b>Marinade items</b> into the Pork Ribs and set 
    aside for 30 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GINGER</b> into two slices and and crush them lightly. 
    Trim white part of <b>SCALLIONS</b> and crush lightly with the 
    side of your prep knife. Mix (use the greens for something else).
    </li>
  <li><u>IF using</u>: Grind <b>Red Yeast Rice</b>.
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Drain <b>Pork Ribs</b> well, <u>reserving marinade</u>.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over high 
    flame.  Stir in drained <b>Pork Ribs</b> and fry, stirring now and 
    then, until lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger mix </b> until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Pour the <b>Pork Rib Mix</b> into a Dutch oven or suitable tightly 
    coverable pot. Stir in reserved <b>Marinade</b>, <b>Sugar</b> and 
    2/3 cup <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer slowly for about 
    30 minutes.</li>
  <li><u>If using</u>: Stir in <b>Red Yeast Rice</b>.</li>
  <li>Continue to simmer slowly for another 30 minutes. Monitor liquid 
    and add boiled water if needed.</li>
  <li>After simmering, uncover the pan. Reduce the liquid at a high 
    simmer until sauce consistency, tumbling the ribs now and then. 
    </li>
  <li>Serve warm, along with lots of paper napkins and a bone bowl.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Fermented Tofu</h3> &nbsp; This can be found 
  in any East and Southeast Asian markets in small jars. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofufz.html">Fermented Tofu</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Yeast Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a natural purplish red food 
  coloring much used in parts of China. It is where Statin drugs were 
  first found, but this small amount from homemade or from a nutritional 
  supplement shouldn't be a problem. The photo example is with a rather 
  intense red fermented tofu, but contains no Red Yeast Rice itself.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Color and flavor will vary considerably based 
  on the character of the Fermented Tofu used. I have made it from a red 
  variety that was so dark the color was dark brown, but is was delicious.
