This recipe exploits the complimentary flavors of pork and orange. It's 
simple to make and can reheat in the oven. They can be served cold, but 
they're better served warm. They will be just moderately sticky.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/4 hr - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths 2" or less (A Chinese 
    cleaver knife works well). Remove any excess fat</li>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER</b> fine, wrap in a square of muslin and squeeze 
    out the juice.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marniade items</b> and massage into <b>Pork Ribs</b>. 
    Marinate the ribs for at least 1 hour turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok, kadhai or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> (at least one 
    cup) very hot and fry <b>Pork Ribs</b> tumbling frequently for about 3 
    minutes until all evidence of rawness is gone.</li>
  <li>Turn down the heat so the ribs are just sizzling and cook tumbling 
    now and then to give them a chance to cook through and become tender. 
    About 10 minutes for thin ribs, 20 minutes for very meaty ones.</li>
  <li>Turn the heat back up very hot and fry the ribs, tumbling frequently 
    until nicely browned, then pull them out and drain well.</li>
  <li>Pour all the oil out and put the pan back over moderate heat, stir up 
    the <b>Sauce Mix</b> and pour it into the pan. Bring it to a strong 
    simmer and scrape to incorporate the "fond" left in the pan. Thin with 
    water as needed to keep a medium sauce consistency.</li>
  <li>When much of the fond is incorporated in the sauce, stir in the 
    <b>Pork Ribs</b> until thoroughly coated and reheated.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm garnished with orange slices.</li>
  </ol></td>
