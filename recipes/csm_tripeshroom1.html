  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 30 minutes in warm water. Squeeze out 
    water and slice into strips about 1/8" wide.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>TRIPE</b> in three changes of water with 1 t salt and a 
    lemon slice in the first two, for about 1-1/4 hours total. For exact 
    method see <a href="csm_tripeshroom1.html#01">Note-1</a>.  It is done when it is still a 
    bit chewy but a fork pierces it easily. Cut into 1/8" wide strips 
    about 2" long and mix with <b>Mushroom slices</b>.</li>
  <li>Core <b>CHILIS</b> and slice lengthwise into strips about 1/8" wide 
    and 2" long.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> <u>including stems</u> quite small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Lard</b> and fry chili slices 
    until just a bit wilted. Turn heat down and add <b>Stock</b>, 
    <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Garlic</b>, bring to a boil and simmer about 
    5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tripe / Mushroom mix</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer 
    another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and turn off heat immediately.</li>
  <li>Serve at once garnished with Cilantro sprigs.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; For best appearance use 
  "blanket" (flat) tripe. Market tripe in the U.S. is cleaned and 
  par-boiled but needs more cooking, and it will shrink considerably. 
  To yield 8 ounces you need to start with a little over a pound. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Fresnos, but other 
  medium hot chilis will work fine too. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional  
  frying medium through Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary 
  and Poland. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans 
  are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans 
  fats the AHA urged us to use instead. It has a better health profile 
  than butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or Avocado oil 
  for richer flavor.</li>
