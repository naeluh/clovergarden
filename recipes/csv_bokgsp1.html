A simple, easy to make stir fry with good flavor  - a fine side dish for 
Asian or Western menus. It can also serve, with rice, as a light 
vegetable main course for two. The photo example is garnished with a 
few Papery Dried Shrimp.

  <li>Grind <b>Dried Shrimp</b> to powder in your spice grinder and

  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in

  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 
    for about 2 minutes, tumbling now and then.</li>
  <li>Uncover and stir in <b>Potato Starch mix</b> (if using), until 
    Bok Choy is glossy. Adjust the liquid if needed. There should be 
    adequate liquid, but the Bok Choy shouldn't be swiming.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed rice. Long grain Thai Jasmine 
    or medium grain (California type) are both appropriate for the 
    Shanghai region.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Bok Choy:</h3> &nbsp; [Shanghai Bok Choy, 
  Baby Bok Choy (markets)] &nbsp; This Bok Choy cooks more quickly and 
  much more evenly than the white stemmed Bok Choy. How you cut it 
  depends on the size. The photo example used the very tiny heads 
  available here in Los Angeles, which were only cut in half and trimmed 
  to 4 inches long. If you use supermarket "Baby Bok Choy", select the 
  smallest heads you can get. Quarter them lengthwise and cut into into 
  4 inch lengths. Include the trimmed tops in the recipe. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_boksz.html">Shanghai Bok Choy</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure 3 T with the 
  shrimp coarsely crushed. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html">Dried Shrimp</a> page.</li>
<li> id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> Use a good drinkable Chinese rice 
  wine. The cooking versions are heavily salted and not that good to start 
  with. If you don't have the rice wine use a dry sherry. Sake, though 
  made from rice, is not considered a good substitute. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe used the 
  shrimp whole, soaked 1/2 hour in Water and Rice Wine. That may be 
  authentic, but it wasn't too pleasant due to prickley shrimp. Since 
  I'm powdering the shrimp, my order of work is different, but works 
  out about the same (except no prickles).</li>
