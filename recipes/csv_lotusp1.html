This is a magnificent stir fried "salad" of pond and land vegetables. 
The flavor is light, but intriguing, with an interesting textural 
contrasts. Use it as a warm appetizer or as a side for stronger flavored 
main dishes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min - (see <a href="csv_lotusp1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>))
  <ol>
  <li>Trim ends and peel <b>LOTUS ROOT</b>. Slice in half lengthwise 
    and slice crosswise a little less than 1/4 inch thick. Hold in 
    lightly salted cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>De-string <b>CELERY</b>, cutting off the edges should be good 
    enough. Slice on a sharp diagonal about 1/2 inch wide. Mix with 
    Lotus Root</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and slice lengthwise about 1/8 inch thick. 
    Cut slices on a sharp diagonal to match the celery slices. Mix 
    with Lotus Root.</li>
  <li>With a sharp vegetable slicing knife, take a thin cut from top and 
    bottom of <b>WATER CHESTNUTS</b>, then peel around the rest with 
    a vegetable peeler. Slice into 3 or 4 rounds, depending on size.</li>
  <li>Trim root and discolored stem end from <b>LILY BULBS</b> and 
    separate all the flakes. Pinch off any discoloration. Mix with 
    Water Chestnuts and keep them both in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin. Cut off white part of 
    <b>SCALLION</b> and crush it lightly. Mix. (Use the Greens for 
    something else).</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Glaze items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min, exclusive of boiling water)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saucepan bring 6 cups <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil. Stir 
    in 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and 1/2 t <b>Oil</b>. Stir in drained 
    <b>Lotus Root mix</b> and bring back to a boil over high heat. 
    Hold at a full boil for about 1-1/2 minutes to just barely cook.</li>
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Water Chestnut mix</b> and bring back to a boil 
    over high heat. As soon as up to a boil, drain in a strainer - do 
    not overcook.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Stir 
    in <b>Ginger mix</b> just until aromatic. Stir in the drained 
    <b>Vegetable mix</b> and fry tumbling over high heat until well 
    heated through.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Glaze mix</b> until glossy.</li>
  <li>Serve as a warm appetizer, or as a side to a contrasting main dish. 
    You can remove the slices of Ginger and the Scallion before serving.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lotus Root:</h3> &nbsp; Actually a Rhyzome, not 
  a root, these are available fresh in many Asian markets year round. 
  They are also available peeled and sliced, frozen or in vacuum pack, 
  though I've found the fresh roots seem to cook better. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/pr_lotusz.html">Lotus </a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water Chestnuts:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for 
  <u>Fresh</u> unpeeled Water Chestnuts. Canned are much more convenient 
  but not nearly as good. If you must use canned, use 5 ounces (usually 
  1 can). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sd_wchestz.html">Water Chestnuts</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lily Bulbs:</h3> &nbsp; These bulbs of the 
  Lanzou Lily are pretty much essential to this recipe as they provide 
  most of the sweetness. They are now quite common in Asian markets in 
  North America. They are sold vacuum packed, 4 bulbs to a package, with 
  an overall weight of about 4 ounces. They are quite perishable and 
  should not be stored long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_davidz.html">Lily Bulb</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; This can be done even a day 
  ahead if the Lotus Root mix and the Ginger mix are packed under 
  water, sealed in heavy plastic bags or jars and refrigerated.</li>
