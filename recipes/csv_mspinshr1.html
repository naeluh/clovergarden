Malabar Spinach is popular all over Southeast Asia, Southern China, 
Southern India and tropical Africa, regions too hot for regular spinach.

  <p>For a faster finish, you could fry the salt fish as part of the 
  prep stage.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>SALTED FISH</b> very thin. Don't worry if it breaks up.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>SAAN CHOY</b> well. Break up vines into convenient lengths, 
    discarding overly thick stems and removing large leaves from stems.</li>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b>. Leave whole or cut in half depending on size 
    and your preference.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate heat and fry <b>Salted 
    Fish</b>, stirring until lightly browned. Remove the fish with a 
    slotted spoon and set aside. Crumble it if it hasn't already broken 
    into small pieces.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring for a moment. Stir in 
    <b>Shrimp</b> and fry stirring for another moment, then stir in 
    <b>Spinach</b> until coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and stir over moderately high heat until 
    Spinach is wilted and a uniform cooked color. Don't overcook or it'll 
    become slimy.</li>
 <li>Adjust liquid if needed, sprinkle with <b>Sesame Oil</b> (dark) and 
    Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Salted Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Fillets of salted fish, often mackerel, 
  are to be found in the freezer cases of markets serving Korean, Chinese 
  and Southeast Asian communities. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshsaltz.html">Salted Fish</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Mong Toi, Saan Choy] &nbsp; 
  It's closer to cactus than to our regular spinach, but has a similar 
  (but much milder) taste. Be careful not to overcook it - it can become 
  slimy. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html">
  <b>Malabar Spinach</b> page</a></li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, 
  use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
