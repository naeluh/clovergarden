Ong Choy is quite popular in Asian communities and makes a very simple 
stir fry with good flavor and interesting texture - but it may be 
illegal in your state. This recipe can also be made without the 
fermented tofu or with yellow bean sauce instead.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Strip Leaves from  <b>ONG CHOY</b>  and tear them into 2 inch 
    lengths with the stem removed. Discard overly thick stem ends if any 
    and cut all stems, including leaf stems, into about 1-1/2 inch 
    lengths. Keep separate from leaves.</li>
   <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
     and chop fine. Mix.</li>

  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and sir in 
    <b>Ginger mix</b>. Fry stirring just a few seconds, then stir in 
    <b>Ong Choy Stems</b>. Fry stirring until coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bean Curd</b> (and <b>Chili Paste</b> if used). When it 
    is well broken up and distributed add <b>Rice Wine</b> and 
    <b>Water</b>.  Cover and simmer stirring occasionally until Ong Choy 
    stems are tender, (about 4 minutes - the bigest ones should remain a 
    bit crisp),</li>
 <li>Stir in the <b>Ong Choy Leaves</b> and simmer until they have wilted 
    (about 2 minutes). Adjust liquid and <b>Salt</b> to taste (if any is 
    needed).</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ong Choy</h3> &nbsp; [Water Spinach] &nbsp; This 
  very popular vegetable is widely available and can be transported 
  without a permit here in California, but is a controled substance in 
  some states. It is quite perishable so should not be bought more than 
  a day ahead. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fermented Bean Curd:</h3> &nbsp; [Fermented Tofu] 
  &nbsp; This is available in markets serving Asian communities. It comes 
  as cubes, 3/4 inch to 1-1/2 inches, packed in small jars of pickling 
  liquid. The proper version for this recipe is packed with chili, but 
  if you have only plain add 1 t of a suitable chili paste to the recipe. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofufz.html"><b>Fermented Tofu</b></a> page. 
  Yellow bean sauce could also be used for a similar flavor. </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> Use a drinkable grade of Chinese rice wine (the 
  cooking versions are salted and not that good). If you don't have the 
  rice wine use a dry sherry. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
