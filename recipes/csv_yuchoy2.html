  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>YU CHOY</b>. Remove yellowed or damaged leaves. Cut away 
    any really huge stem ends. Trim sprigs to a reasonably uniform 
    length. Split big end of stems in half for an inch or so, or in 
    quarters for really big ones.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GARLIC</b> quite coarse.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Oyster Sauce</b>, <b>Stock</b> and 1/4 t <b>Salt</b>.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a wok or wide saut&eacute; pan, place plenty of <b>Water</b> 
    for cooking the Yu Choy. Add 1/3 t <b>Salt</b> and bring to a boil. 
    Drip in a few drops of <b>Sesame Oil</b>. Turn down heat and keep 
    near a simmer, ready for the Yu Choy.</li>
  <li>In a small pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Garlic</b>. Fry 
    stirring until Garlic threatens to color. Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, 
    bring to a boil, then cover and keep hot (but not to a boil), to 
    wait for the Yu Choy.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Water</b> back to a full boil. Lay in the 
    <b>Yu Choy</b> and bring back to a full boil. Simmer for about 
    4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Lift out the <b>Yu Choy</b> with tongs, and place onto a serving 
    dish. Distribute the hot <b>Sauce</b> fairly evenly over the Yu Choy 
    and serve immediately (see also <a href="csv_yuchoy2.html#03"><b>Serving</b></a>).
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Yu Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This popular green is now very available in 
  Asian markets, but hasn't hit the supers yet. Shanghai Bok Choy (sold 
  as "Baby Bok Choy") could also be used. Other Choys have tougher stems 
  requiring longer cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian Cabbage / Mustard 
  Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; For such small amounts, I usually just use 
  some water and an appropriate bit of Chicken Powder (Or Vegeta 
  for vegetarian). In Asia, a dash of Magi Seasoning is often used.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Serving whole sprigs, as in the photo, is 
  very pretty and often done. It does present challenges at the table. 
  The stems are just a little too tough to easily cut with the side of 
  a fork, and you wouldn't want them overcooked. I break off leaf stems 
  from the main stem, then fold them up for easy eating - I don't know 
  how you'd handle these with chopsticks. My practical suggestion is, 
  remove from the water to the cutting board and slice crosswise into 
  about 2 inch lengths, give them a toss, transfer to the serving 
  dish(s) and spoon the Sauce over.</li>
