Officially you start with live snails in the shell, but in North 
America this isn't practical - so see <a href="daf_snails1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>. 
If you can't get or don't want to deal with snails, see <a href="daf_snails1.html#06">
<b>Note-6</b></a>.

  <ol>
  <li><b>IF</b> using <b>LIVE SNAILS</b> follow the directions on the page 
    <a href="gsf_snails2.html"><b>Preparing Live Snails</b></a>.
  <li>Start the Chilis soaking for <a href="djx_biscay1.html">
    <b>Biscayne Sauce</b></a>.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 to 6 hours, depending on snails)
  <ol start="3">
  <li><b>IF</b> using frozen snail meat, boil plenty of water and 
    parboil the snails for about 2 minutes (thaw the snails first).</li>
  <li>Make <b>COURT BOUILLON</b>. Chop all the vegetables and put in a pan 
    with water salt and vinegar. Simmer for about 1/2 hour, then strain 
    and discard the vegetables.</li>
  <li>Simmer <b>Snails</b> in <b>Court Bouillon</b> until as tender as 
    you want them (or can get them for Apple Snails). Some sources say 
    fresh vineyard snails are ready in about an hour, but Apple Snail 
    meat needs simmering for maybe 5 hours.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: Make <a href="djx_biscay1.html"><b>Biscayne 
    Sauce</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Hard boil <b>EGGS</b>, cool, shell (for best method see 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>. Eat the whites 
    with a little salt and save the yolks.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Onion</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Ham</b> and <b>Chorizo</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>When Snails are done: In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    over moderate heat and fry <b>Onions</b> for a couple of minutes. 
    Stir in <b>Ham mix</b> and continue to fry over moderate heat until 
    sausage begins to brown.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Biscayne Sauce</b>. Cook stirring over moderate heat 
    until bubbly.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Snails</b>, mixing them well with the sauce. Chop 
    <b>Egg Yolks</b> fine and mix them in along with the <b>Pepper 
    Flakes</b>. Continue to cook over low heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve warm. For buffet, I serve this in a sauce warmer (a tiny 
    Crock Pot) and put out a basket of toast squares and a spoon.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Snails:</h3> &nbsp; The original recipe calls for about 3 pounds 
  live vineyard snails in the shell. Tubs of live snails are very scarce 
  in North America, even here in Los Angeles, so we must compromise. The 
  suggested alternative is canned in-the-shell snails from France. They 
  can be had, but the awe inspiring cost makes them impractical too. 
  Fortunately, the Asian markets around here have a plentiful supply of 
  frozen Apple Snails and Apple Snail Meat at reasonable prices. Our 
  recipe, based on apple snail meat, gets you a whole lot more snail 
  meat than you'd get from the live snails. Note that 2 pounds of frozen 
  snail meat will get you a little less than 1 pound cooked "tender". 
  For details, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_gpapplez.html"><b>Apple 
  Snail</b></a> page. If you do go for live snails, see our page 
  <a href="gsf_snails2.html"><b>Preparing Live Snails</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; If using snails in the shell, 
  use enough water to cover them by 1 or 2 inches.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serrano Ham:</h3> &nbsp; This is an unsmoked salt cured ham, now 
  legal in the US, but astoundingly expensive. Some similar are made in 
  North America now, but are still scarce. A similar product available 
  at almost any deli is Italian Prosciutto.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chorizo:</h3> &nbsp; <u>NOT</u> Mexican chorizo, but also not a 
  hard dry Spanish chorizo. This needs to be Chorizo de Balbao or a 
  similar semi-cured cooking chorizo. I buy Balbao from the freezer 
  cases in Philippine markets (USA made), but it can be ordered from 
  Spanish sausage makers like La Espanola Meats. If you can't find 
  it, use a firm, mildly hot pork sausage. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausage</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Biscayne Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very famous sauce in the 
  Basque region and is not difficult to make. See our recipe 
  <a href="djx_biscay1.html"><b>Biscayne Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Option:</h3> &nbsp; So you're not quite up to dealing with snails. 
  No problem, this recipe is already less than totally authentic on a 
  couple counts, so instead of snails you can use diced Duck Gizzards. 
  These are available in most Asian markets and take a lot less simmering 
  than snails. The flavor is reasonably similar and the texture more 
  tender (depending on cooking time).</li>
