Sometimes called "Spanish Roulette", most are mild, a few are not. This 
dish is very popular in tapas bars in Spain and California.

<p>I served these (Sashitos) at a buffet party (late 2019) and they were 
very much liked - and all eaten. People even asked where they could get 
the peppers.</p>

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min)
  <ol>
  <li>On your hottest burner, in a spacious pan (see <a href="dav_padron1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>), heat <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    to about 440&deg;F/225&deg;C or until you see the first wisp of smoke.
    </li>
  <li>Fry <b>Peppers</b>, tumbling frequently, until they are fairly 
    covered with brown blisters - but they should still be a bit crisp! 
    Keep your oil just below smoking for best results.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately sprinkled with coarse <b>Sea Salt</b>.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Padr&oacute;n Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; These are small wrinkled green 
  chilis grown in Galicia, Spain and California - and probably Virginia, 
  as La Tienda sells them (at a high price). Look for them at farmer's 
  markets - in the stands that sell unusual stuff. &nbsp; 
  <b><u>Subst</u>:</b> &nbsp; easily available Shishito (Japanese) chilis 
  are very much the same, including wrinkling and occasional heat, 
  except narrower and longer. They work superbly. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_padshiz.html"><b>Chilis: Padr&oacute;n &amp; 
  Shishito</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use "Pure Olive Oil" (sometimes 
  marketed as just "Olive Oil"). The required temperature is way too 
  high for Virgin or Extra Virgin. Olive Pomace will go to even higher 
  temperatures.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pan:</h3> &nbsp; The chilis will pop and spit a lot when they 
  first hit the oil, so my prefered pan is an Indian 
  <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, designed to contain 
  this. It also requires only a modest amount of oil to do this job. A 
  wok is similar but shallower.</li>
