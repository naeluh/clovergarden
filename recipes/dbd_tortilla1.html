Potato tortillas are popular everywhere in Spain as a breakfast, snack 
or picnic item. They may be served warm or at room temperature.

If served immediately the center can still be a bit runny, but see it is 
set all the way through if to be served later. The finished tortilla 
in the photo weighed 1-1/2 pounds.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into squares about 3/8 inch square and 
    1/8 inch thick - see <a href="dbd_tortilla1.html#02"><b>Equipment</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> about 3/8 inch.</li>
  <li>Heat 1/8 inch <b>Oil</b> over moderate heat. Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> 
    and <b>Onions</b>. Cook turning now and then until done through but 
    not at all browned. I'd use a larger pan because your tortilla pan 
    would be a bit cramped.</li>
  <li>Strain cooked <b>Potato mix</b> in a wire strainer and let cool 
    some, Catch the oil for the next tortilla or for some other use.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> and <b>Salt</b> thoroughly with a fork, then stir 
    into <b>Potato mix</b>, thoroughly.</li>
  <li>In a 9 inch heavy, well seasoned iron skillet, heat 1-1/2 T <b>Olive 
    Oil</b> quite hot. Pour in the <b>Egg mix</b>. Reduce heat to moderate 
    and cook until the bottom and sides have set fairly well. I cover 
    the pan with a large saut&eacute; pan lid to encourage a little 
    setting on the top.</li>
  <li>With a wooden spatula, loosen the edges of the tortilla and shake 
    the pan to loosen the bottom.</li>
  <li>Cover the pan with a large plate. Invert, dumping the tortilla onto 
    the plate. <u>Caution:</u> it's going to still be  quite runny but the 
    set shell should keep it together.</li>
  <li>Add another 1/2 T <b>Olive Oil</b> to the pan and slide the 
    tortilla back in, what was the top now the bottom. Continue to cook 
    over moderate heat until the tortilla. is pretty well set. Some say 
    to turn it again twice, cooking briefly on each side. This is to get 
    the edges nice and round, said to be the mark of an expert tortilla 
    cook.</li>
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or Red potatoes will work well 
  here. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Equipment:</h3> &nbsp; This is what you need 
  (see <a href="dbd_tortilla1x.html#gall"><b>Gallery</b></a>):
  <ul>
  <li><b>French Fry Cutter:</b> &nbsp; Not essential but a real 
    convenience. I use the French fry blade of my Oxo mandolin. Once you 
    have French fries it's easy to line up a bunch and cut them crosswise.
    </li>
  <li><b>Skillet:</b> &nbsp; A 9 inch well seasoned iron skillet with 
    rounded or sloping sides. The photo shows mine immediately after 
    cooking the tortilla in the photo.
  <li><b>Plate:</b> &nbsp; A large, preferably rimless plate quite a bit 
    bigger than the tortilla pan. Mine is 11-3/8 inches diameter. 
    <b>Note:</b> I have seen it suggested to use a large lid from a 
    saut&eacute; pan which has a nice handle on it - <u>BUT</u> it must 
    be distinctly concave - that tortilla will be slipperier than a 
    greased pig and will slide right off a flat surface.</li>
  <li><b>Misc:</b> &nbsp; Mixing bowls and wooden spatula.</li>
  </ul>
