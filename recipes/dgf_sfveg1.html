An eye catching party salad that's not difficult to make. If you use the 
optional Surimi Baby Eels, that increases the cost, but I like them as 
a visual contrast.

<p>This recipe makes 3-1/2 pounds - probably enough for 12 on the buffet 
if there's much else. It can be made the evening before.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs+ - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into small florets. Weight is for 
    florets only with no thick stems. Bring water to a full boil in 
    your steamer and steam <b>Cauliflower</b> until just barely done - 
    that'll be about 6 minutes max. <u>Do not overcook</u>! Refresh with 
    cold running water, drain and place in a  mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>BELL PEPPER</b> about 3/8 inch. Dice <b>TOMATO</b> just a 
    little larger. Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> small. Mix all with
    Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Sliver <b>ONION</b> very thin (cut diagonally, but more lengthwise 
    than crosswise). Mix with Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Add to Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> and cut into about 3 pieces each. Mix with 
    Cauliflower.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>DILL</b> small. Mix with Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>cut <b>SQUID</b> into salad size pieces, usually rings.</li>
  <li>Bring 6 cups <b>Water</b> to a boil with 1/2 T Lemon Juice and 
    1/2 t Salt. Dump in the <b>Mussels</b> for about 2 minutes. Scoop 
    out and let cool. Dump the <b>Squid</b> into the boiling water and 
    cook 2 minutes, <u>no more or you'll end up with rubber squid</u>. 
    Drain and refresh under cold running water. &nbsp; <u>Caution:</u> 
    if using tentacles, cook them after scooping out the squid tubes 
    or the purple skin will discolor them.</li>
  <li>When cool, add the <b>Mussels</b> and <b>Squid</b> to the 
    Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Open cans of <b>Baby Eels</b> and drain well. Add to the 
    Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing Items</b> in a small jar that can be shaken 
    vigorously.</li>
  <li>A few hours before serving, vigorously shake up the <b>Dressing</b> 
    and pour over the <b>Salad</b>. Tumble gently and Refrigerate until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Serve cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cauliflower:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for 
  <u>florets</u> <u>only</u> - as the amount of stems and leaves 
  included in a head of cauliflower varies greatly.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mussel Meats:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  calls for medium size in the shell, steaming and discarding the 
  shells, but they're much more economical (and convenient) shelled 
  and frozen in bags. The Asian markets here in Los Angeles generally 
  have these in the freezer cases. Medium size New Zealand are fine 
  for this recipe, the largest being a bit too large for a salad.  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cleaned and skinned 
  - with tentacles if possible. If uncleaned, you'll need to start with 
  twice the weight. Asian markets are the best source, having many forms 
  on ice and in the freezer cases, cleaned and not, but the small Squid 
  Rings found in many regular markets can be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Baby Eels:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example is made 
  with Surimi Baby Eels You'll need 2 3.8 oz cans for this full recipe. 
  Ubago brand Surimi Eels are available from La Espa&ntilde;ola Meats.
  <u>Do Not</u> buy real ones, which cost between $11 and $18 per ounce 
  (depending on vendor) due to being nearly extinct, and canned are much 
  inferior to fresh anyway, Surimi Eels cost about 2017 US $1.20 per 
  ounce, canned, and look very much like real ones. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Mediterranean 
  olives, not California salad olives (unless those are all you have). 
  Turkish black olives are readily available in vacuum packs and are 
  excellent. I usually use pre-pitted small Kalamatas available from a 
  nearby deli.</li>
