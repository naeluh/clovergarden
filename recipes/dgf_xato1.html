An unusual salad with an intensely flavorful dressing (Xat&oacute;). 
This salad is traditional in Catalonya, the northeast corner of Spain.

Recipes vary some, but the green used must be Escarole, regular lettuce 
doesn't have the bitterness needed. The amount of fish can vary a little 
but there shouldn't be too much. "You have forced me to like salad" - 
actual quote from a committed carnivore.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 days)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>SALT COD</b> in cold water in the refrigerator for 
    2 days or a little more, changing the water twice a day.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Core and seed the <b>CHILI</b> (see <a href="dgf_xato1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>). Break it up and run to powder in your spice 
    grinder.</li>
  <li>If raw, toast <b>HAZLENUTS</b> until very lightly browned (see 
    <a href="dgf_xato1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Include some extras so you can 
    sample for the roasted flavor. Cool and crush.</li>
  <li>In a mortar, or preferably in a mini-prep food processor, mash 
    together all <b>Dressing Items</b>, starting with the solids and 
    finishing with the liquids. Add just a touch of water if the 
    dressing seems too thick, but it should be quite thick, not 
    runny.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>ESCAROLE</b> rather small. Drain <b>COD</b> and shred 
    very small. Drain <b>TUNA</b> and break up quite small. Break up 
    <b>ANCHOVIES</b>. Pit <b>OLIVES</b>. Slice <b>RADISHES</b> thin. 
    Toss all together well.</li>
  <li>Serve cold with <b>Dressing</b> drizzled over (see

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Salt Cod:</h3> &nbsp; This can usually be found 
  easily in Italian groceries and delicatessens. I have also found it in 
  a Korean market here in Los Angeles, but theirs was rather bony and 
  skin-on. If you can't get salt cod, increase the amount of tuna and 
  anchovies to compensate. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_codsaltz.html"><b>Salt Cod</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I suggest using a large California Chili. In 
  Spain dried Nora chilis would be used, but these are prohibitively 
  expensive in North America. Because Noras have no heat, a small hot 
  chili would be included, use your own best judgement as to whether a 
  small hot chili should be added along with a  California Chili, but 
  the dressing should have some bite. Of course you could also use a 
  chili powder of your choice. Traditionally the chilis are soaked and 
  the flesh scraped off with the skins discarded, but with a whirling 
  blade spice grinder this is not necessary.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hazelnuts:</h3> &nbsp; These are best if freshly 
  shelled and roasted in a dry pan or in a 350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven for 
  about 5 minutes (easier, but dangerous, because you'll probably forget 
  about them). If you are in a hurry you can use pre-roasted hazelnuts.
  Some recipes specify almonds.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; Recipes vary in asking for red or white, 
  so either can be used - but quality matters. I usually use an imported 
  Italian wine vinegar, but California wine vinegars can also be very 
  good (though harder to find).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tuna:</h3> &nbsp; This is about what you will get from a 5 ounce 
  can of water packed Chunk Light Tuna, if it's one of the better brands.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Anchovies:</h3> &nbsp; Avoid Moroccan anchovies which tend to be 
  lower quality in flavor and consistency (sometimes as bad as mush full 
  of scales and bones). Those from Italy, Spain, Chile and Peru are 
  usually fine. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_anchopd.html">
  <b>Anchovy Products</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These should salt/oil cured Mediterranean 
  olives, not canned California salad olives. Those from Turkey are 
  generally very good and easily available.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; For buffet service make half again as much 
  dressing and serve it in a bowl with a very small ladel - not in a 
  pourable container or some bozo will pour it all on his portion.
  </li>
