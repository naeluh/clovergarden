This sauce/dip (pronounced "moho") is used with fish, potatoes and 
fresh cheese, as a sauce, dip or marinade. Similar sauces sare used 
in the Caribbean and South America.

Cilantro was once the top herb in most of Europe, taken to the Canary 
Islands, the New World, and Asia by European traders. In Europe it has 
been almost entirely replaced by parsley, but the Canary Islands and 
Latin America are still very big on Cilantro, as is most of Asia.

    (this recipe just fits in my mini-prep processor) you will have to 
    start adding Olive Oil as soon as you put in the garlic, as garlic 
    is very sticky.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; Volume is leaves only, 
  finely chopped and lightly packed, with all coarse stems discarded. 
  Measuring Cilantro (and other fresh herbs) is a real pain, but here 
  there is so much it is easier. 1 c finely chopped = 6-3/4 ounces 
  whole bunches (big stemmy bunches like we get in Southern California 
  produce markets). This will yield about 3-1/2 ounces of leaf, so 3-1/2 
  ounces leaves = 1 cup chopped fine.</li>
