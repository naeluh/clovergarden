This sauce is typical of Catalunya, in the northeast corner of 
Spain. Recipes vary a bit from town to town, but in all cases it's a 
thick red sauce.

<p>This sauce is most famous as the dressing for 
<a href="dgf_xato1.html"><b>Xatonada Salad</b></a>, but it is 
also used as a dip or dressing for fish, snails, chicken, lamb and 
vegetables.</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
    <li>Core and seed the <b>CHILI</b> (see <a href="djv_xato1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>). Break it up and run to powder in your spice 
    grinder.</li>
  <li>If raw, toast <b>HAZLENUTS</b> until very lightly browned (see 
    <a href="djv_xato1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Include some extras so you can sample 
    for the roasted flavor. The brown skins should mostly rub off, but 
    no need to get anal about it, a few patches of skin won't hurt. 
    Cool and crush.</li>
  <li>In a mortar, or preferably in a mini-prep food processor, mash 
    together all <b>Dressing Items</b>, starting with the solids and 
    finishing with the liquids. Add just a touch of water if the 
    dressing seems too thick, but it should be quite thick, not 
    runny.</li>
  <li>Serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I suggest using a large 
  California Chili. In Spain dried Nora chilis would be used, but these 
  are prohibitively expensive in North America. Because Noras have no 
  heat, a small hot chili would be included.	use your own best judgement 
  as to whether a small hot chili should be added along with a  
  California Chili, but the dressing should have some bite. For me, I'd 
  certainly add a hot chili, but depending on my guests I might not. 
  Traditionally the chilis are soaked and the flesh scraped off with 
  the skins discarded, but with a whirling blade spice grinder this is 
  not at all necessary.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hazelnuts:</h3> &nbsp; These are best if freshly 
  shelled and roasted in a dry pan or in a 350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven for 
  about 5 minutes (easier, but dangerous, because you'll probably forget 
  about them). If you are in a hurry you can use pre-roasted hazelnuts.
  Some recipes specify almonds.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; Recipes vary in asking for 
  red or white, so either can be used - but quality matters. I usually 
  use an imported Italian wine vinegar, but California wine vinegars 
  can also be very good (though harder to find).</li>
