The ingredient list may seem rather simplistic - basically, chicken 
and onions, and preparation is very easy, but the result is both 
unusual and delicious.

<p>This is a fine dish for a family meal or party buffet, and reheats 
well.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (20 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into serving pieces. About 1-1/2 inch is fine, 
  or a bit larger for family service (see <a href="dmc_chkonn1.html#03">
  <b>Note-3</b></a>). Tumble with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> and 
  set aside.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
<li>Peel loose skin from <b>GARLIC</b>, but leave the head intact.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol start="4">
<li>Dust <b>Chicken</b> with flour, shaking off any excess (see 
  <a href="dmc_chkonn1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
<li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and 
  fry <b>Chicken</b> over moderate heat until lightly browned. Be careful 
  any fond that adheres to the pan does not burn.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Wine</b>, then <b>Garlic Head</b>, 
  <b>Bay Leaf</b> and <b>Saffron</b>. Cover and simmer slowly until 
  Chicken is done, about 40 minutes. Add more <b>Stock</b> only if 
  needed, the sauce should be fairly thick.</li>
<li>Fish out <b>Garlic Head</b>. Squeeze all the pulp out and discard 
  the skins. Stir the pulp into the sauce.</li>
<li>Check <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, adjusting if required. Serve 
  with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, 
  boneless meat. I always use Thigh / Leg meat as it has better flavor 
  and texture than the cardboard flavored breast meat we get around here. 
  The pattern recipe calls a 3-1/2 pound chicken cut into serving pieces, 
  but for buffet service boneless meat is easier for the guests to deal 
  with, and for family dinner there's no fighting over who gets what 
  parts.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Use the bones, skins and fat to make the Stock, 
  so you won't lose any flavor. Defat the stock using your Gravy 
  Separator.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The size of the chicken 
  pieces and the flour they are dusted with are a critical factor in 
  this dish. The flour dusting the chicken makes it easier to fry, 
  but it is also the thickener for the sauce. If you cut the pieces 
  quite small you need to be careful to shake off as much flour as you 
  can,  or you'll need to add more chicken stock and will end up with 
  quite a lot of sauce. If you're serving with steamed rice, a fair 
  amount of sauce is fine, but for serving other ways you may want 
  a little less.</li>
