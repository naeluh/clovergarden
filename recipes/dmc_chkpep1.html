This recipe, first published in the 16th century, probably hails 
from Moorish times. It was the Moors who brought almonds and saffron to 
Spain, and sauces made from them.

<p>My recipe, configured for buffet service, differs somewhat from most 
recipes for this dish - see <a href="dmc_chkpep1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.</p>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite size pieces, about 2 inches 
  is good. Tumble them well with the <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b></li>
<li>Chop 6 oz <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Scald <b>BOILING ONIONS</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
  water. Trim a little off the tip and peel. Trim the root end minimally, 
  so it holds the onions together.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1/2 to 1 inch long rounds, 
  depending on size.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch chunks. Hold in cold 
  water until needed.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Prepare Sauce</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol start="5">
<li>Boil and peel <b>EGGS</b> <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"> (<b>Best 
  Method</b>)</a>. Separate Yolks from Whites. Crush Yolks lightly. Chop 
  Whites small for Garnish and set aside.</li>
<li>Soak <b>SAFFRON</b> in 1 T warm water for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b>, crush and chop fine.</li>
<li>Run <b>ALMONDS</b> in a mini-prep processor or similar until as 
  finely ground as they will get. Add chopped <b>Garlic</b>, 
  <b>Egg Yolks</b> and <b>Saffron</b> (with its water). Grind together 
  as best you can, scraping down the sides often.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
<ol start="9">
<li>In a saut&eacute; pan or skillet, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and 
  fry <b>Chicken</b> over moderately high heat, tumbling until lightly 
  browned. Be careful any fond that adheres to the pan does not burn.
  Remove to the Stew Pot or Dutch Oven, leaving Oil behind.</li>
<li>Add <b>Onions</b>, <b>Carrots</b> and <b>Potatoes</b> to the Stew 
  Pot. Arrange all contents neatly.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Wine</b> into the frying pan and bring to a simmer, scraping 
  up all the fond. Pour in with the Chicken.</li>
<li>Add <b>Stock</b> to the Pot, along with <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> 
  <b>Cinnamon</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
  slowly until Chicken is tender, about 30 minutes (45 min or more 
  for whole joints).</li>
<li>Strain out solids and set aside, returning all the liquid to the 
  pot.</li>
<li>Stir enough liquid from the pot into the <b>Sauce</b> to make 
  a fairly thin paste. Whisk the paste into the pot. Bring to a 
  slow boil and simmer slowly for about 15 minutes, covered or 
  uncovered as needed to adjust consistency - this sauce should be 
  quite liquid, or it will seize up when off the heat.</li>
<li>Stir the <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Vegetables</b> back into the 
  sauce until well heated.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Egg Whites</b> and/or 
  chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, 
  boneless Thigh and/or Leg meat, now easily available in markets. 
  The pattern recipe called for a whole 3 to 4 pound chicken cut into 
  serving pieces - see <a href="dmc_chkpep1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Boiling Onions:</h3> &nbsp; These should be 
  maximum 1-1/2 inches diameter. a bit smaller is better.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. Actually, The pattern 
  recipe called for tiny Red Potatoes with skins on, but none that 
  small are available around here. If peeled or cut, reds don't hold 
  together as well as White Rose. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; If using my method here for buffet service 
  (chicken leg and thigh chunks) use the bones, skins and fat to make 
  the Stock so no flavor is lost. Defat the stock using your Gravy 
  Separator.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Olive Oil</h3> &nbsp; Temperatures will be a bit 
  high, so use Pure Olive Oil, not Virgin.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; 
    <ul>
    <li>As it is popularly served in restaurants, this dish is usually 
      just the sauce over whole chicken thighs and/or drumsticks. 
      Recipes may call for them skinless to cut the amount of fat. If 
      skin-on, most of the fat must be poured off at the end of the 
      frying step.</li>
    <li>The pattern recipe is different in including vegetables, but it 
      originates from a Spanish cook employed in the home, where this 
      approach is quite practical. It called for a whole chicken cut 
      into serving pieces, with the excess fat poured off after 
      frying.</li>
    <li>For convenience of buffet service, my recipe uses leg and thigh 
      chunks rather than whole joints. This can also eliminate fights 
      over who gets which piece for home service. The Chicken chunks 
      match the size of the vegetables nicely, and there will be no 
      excess fat to pour off. There will be no loss of flavor, because 
      the Stock will be made of the bones and skins.</li>
      </ul>
