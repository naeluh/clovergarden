  <p>This recipe is sized to fill an 8 quart pot.</p>

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>CHICKPEAS</b> with water to cover and 2 t <b>Salt</b> 
    (yes, salt) for at least 8 hour. Drain.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-1/2 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Split <b>BONES</b> lengthwise if large.</li>
  <li>Strip skin and trim fat from <b>CHICKEN</b> but leave as whole joints.
    </li>
  <li>Place in a large pot <b>Bones</b>, <b>PIG FOOT</b>, <b>BEEF</b> (in 
    one piece) and <b>Chicken</b>. Add <b>Water</b> to cover well and bring to 
    a rapid boil for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Dump it all out into the sink, Wash the pot and rinse the meats to 
    remove all sludge.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Bones</b> <u>only</u> back in the pot. Add water to cover and 
    the <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for at least 2 hours.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Pig Foot</b> and <b>Chickpeas</b>. Add water to cover as needed 
    and simmer another 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Beef</b> and water to cover as needed. Simmer another 1-1/2 
    hours.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Meanwhile:</u></b>
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Cut <b>CARROTS</b> into large chunks, Trim <b>LEEKS</b> down to white 
    and light green. Split them in half lengthwise and wash out all the grit 
    from between the leaves. Cut <b>CELERY</b> stalks in half so they'll fit 
    in the pot. Peel <b>ONION</b>, split in half lengthwise and stick each 
    half with a clove. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut in half crosswise. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>SWISS CHARD</b> but keep the leaves whole. Reserve the stems 
    for another use.</li>
  <li>When <b>Beef</b> has cooked for 1-1/2 hours, add <b>Chicken</b>, 
    <b>Vegetable mix</b> and <b>Chorizo</b> (as whole links). Add water 
    as needed to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer another 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Now add <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Morcilla</b> (in one piece), <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>. Again bring to a boil and simmer.</li>
  <li>After 10 minutes simmering put in the <b>Swiss Chard</b>.</li>
  <li>When the Potatoes are done you're ready to serve. Here's the traditional 
    way, but see also <a href="dmm_cocido1.html#06"><b>Note-9</b></a>.
    <ol>
    <li>Strain out all solids and de-fat the liquid (use your gravy 
      separator).</li>
    <li>Sort out and discard the bones, onion, leeks and anything else 
      that's mushy.</li>
    <li>Cut into serving pieces the <b>Beef</b>, <b>Pig Foot</b>, 
      <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Chorizo</b> and <b>Morcilla</b>. A sharp 
      Chinese cleaver knife and a soft faced mallet are invaluable for 
      cutting chicken and pig foot bones). Arrange on a platter.</li>
    <li>Cut <b>Vegetables</b>, including <b>Chard</b> to convenient sizes 
      as needed and arrange on  a platter along with <b>Chickpeas</b>.
      </li>
    <li>Add some of the liquid to each platter to keep the contents moist.
      </li>
    <li>Bring remaining liquid to a boil, add pasta and anything else you 
      want to make a soup course.</li>
    </ol></li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bones:</h3> &nbsp; This is supposed to be a bone from a Serrano Ham 
  or other unsmoked cured ham. I'm betting you don't have that on hand, 
  so you'll probably have to make due with beef or pork bones or such.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pig Foot:</h3> &nbsp; The pig foot is essential as a one-fingered 
  gesture to Muslim invaders, and as a test for converted Jews, but also 
  adds substance to the broth. In Europe this would be a salted pig foot 
  soaked overnight. In North America those are very rare, so use a fresh 
  foot and skip the soaking. If your market cuts their pig feet into 
  pieces, that's fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for a single piece, boneless and with 
  all excess fat trimmed. Chuck, Round or another relatively tough 
  flavorful cut is best.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given here is for chicken 
  thighs (what I use) before stripping skin and fat. I usually also bone 
  them. In Spain they'd likely just chop up a whole chicken.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chorizo:</h3> &nbsp; <u>NOT</u> Mexican chorizo, but also not 
  a hard dry Spanish chorizo. This needs to be Chorizo de Balbao or a 
  similar semi-cured cooking chorizo. I buy Balbao from the freezer cases 
  in Philippine markets (USA made), but it can be ordered from Spanish 
  sausage makers like La Espanola Meats. If you can't find it, use a 
  firm, mildly hot pork sausage.  For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I favor White Rose for recipes of this sort. 
  Avoid Yukon Gold types which disintegrate to mush if cooked just a 
  little long. For details See our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Morcilla</h3> &nbsp; OK, this is the tough one. This is a 
  Spanish blood sausage that is likely right at hand in the Spanish 
  kitchen - but not in North America. Do not use Morcilla de Arroz (with 
  rice) as it swells and disintegrates. If you can't get Morcilla, use a 
  French Boudin Noir or English Black Pudding (also blood sausages). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sausage.html">
  <b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Cooking</h3> &nbsp; This recipe will fill an 8-quart 
  pot. If you make, say, a recipe and a half for a party, and an 8 quart 
  pot is your largest, you can cook the Beef stage 2 hours instead of 
  1-1/2. Pull out Beef, Bones and Pig Foot. Discard the bones and keep 
  the meats warm while proceeding with the rest.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; The serving method given in the steps above  
  is "official". but clearly impractical for other than a big family 
  dinner. I serve this as a buffet party dish so do it differently. After 
  cutting everything to serving pieces I just pile it all in a big 
  electric skillet (mine's a 16 inch Presto with glass lid) with plenty 
  of the liquid and just skip the pasta. Very successful.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Reheating</h3> &nbsp; This recipe reheats very well. The chicken 
  will disintegrate into shreds but the general flavor improves.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; The Cocido of Spain and the 
  <a href="amm_cozido1.html"><b>Cozido</b></a> of Portugal and Brazil 
  are very similar, but the Spanish includes Chickpeas and the Portuguise 
  doen't.  Both are adapted from the <a href="hmm_sefrina1.html">
  <b>Sefrina / Adafina</b></a> of the Sephardic Jews. Forbidden to 
  cook on the Sabbath (cooking is considered work) they would prepare a 
  one-pot meal on Friday evening, which could be left to stay warm in 
  the kitchen embers and feed the family for the next day. As with most 
  traditional recipes, ingredients vary, and the The Spanish / Portuguese 
  versions include ingredients forbidden to the Jews. Also, there's 
  nothing to keep non-Jews from finishing up the stew on the day it is 
  to be served, regardless of what that day might be. Our Gods and 
  Goddesses are on call all day every day (or as they please), and permit 
  work on any day.</li>
