<p>While this recipe uses Medieval spices, for a truly Medieval effect 
you'd want to use a lot more - those who could afford spices used a heavy 
hand to show off their wealth, but you might find that inedible.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into the size chunks appropriate for how you will be 
  serving it. 1-1/2 inch or so is usually good.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix with <b>Salt</b> and 
  <b>Pepper</b> and pound to paste in a mortar (the salt and pepper will 
  help mash the garlic).</li>
<li>Massage the paste into the <b>BEEF</b> very thoroughly - yes, I said 
  "massage", not mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Chop <b>BACON</b> fine.</li>
<li>Set <b>CAPERS</b> soaking in cold water to cover to reduce salt.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix with <b>Pine Nuts</b> and <b>Salt</b> 
  and pound to paste in a mortar.</li>
<li>Grind <b>CINNAMON</b> and grate <b>NUTMEG</b>. Mix together with 
  <b>Ground Ginger</b>, the <b>Clove</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>.</li>
<li>For Garnish, chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and/or <b>EGG</b> as desired (I don't 
  bother with egg, but then I'm not Spanish). Note that in Medieval timse 
  Cilantro would likely have been used rather than Parsley.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="10">
<li>Heat <b>Olive Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry 
  <b>Beef</b>, tumbling frequently until lightly browned on all sides. 
  Be very careful the fond that sticks to the pan doesn't burn.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Bacon</b> and fry stirring for a couple of minutes, 
  then stir in <b>Onion Mix</b>.and continue to fry stirring until onions 
  are softened.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Spice mix</b>, then <b>Stock</b>, <b>Wine</b> and 
  <b>Vinegar</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly, and simmer slowly until 
  Beef is tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours depending on cut.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Capers</b> and stir in along with <b>Pine Nut mix</b>. 
  Simmer a few more minutes. Check liquid and add more <b>Stock</b> if 
  needed (the pine nuts will thicken the sauce somewhat - and see <a 
  href="dmm_cowof1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
<li>Serve hot with Rice, Boiled Potatoes, or, for medieval authenticity, 
  coarse bread.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is stewing beef trimmed 
  of all excess fat, membranes and tendons. Shoulder clod is good, or 
  round, but that takes longer simmering.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  Chicken broth, but Pork (the recipe is already tainted with bacon, so 
  you don't have to worry about kosher) or Beef stock will work fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thickening:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe provides rather 
  little sauce. If you want more you can do this Medievally by using more 
  of a strong stock and thickening with some blanched almonds (raw) pounded 
  to paste and added to the pine nut mix..</li>
