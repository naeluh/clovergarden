<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (3-1/2 hrs)
<ol>
<li>Blanch <b>ONIONS</b> in boiling water for one minute to make them easy 
  to peel. Cut off the tips and pull the peels down around the root end. 
  Cut off as little as possible at the root end so the onions hold together 
  well.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Onions</b> in <b>Olive Oil</b> (use Pure, not Virgin) slowly 
  turning now and then until lightly browned. Keeping the oil at about 
  350&deg;F/175&deg;C this will take about 15 minutes. </li>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of any excess fat. Fry in the same <b>Oil</b> 
  until nicely browned on all sides, This will take about 20 minutes for a 
  3 pound lump of beef, keeping the oil at about 400&deg;F/200&deg;C. 
  See <a href="dmm_cowprst1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for details. </li>
<li>Roast <b>GARLIC</b>. Wrap the whole head in foil, stick it with a skewer 
  for easy handling, and roast it over a gas burner (or whatever you can 
  manage). Turn frequently, and it's done when you see wisps of smoke. 
  Let cool, then remove skins.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
  water, skin them and cut into pieces about 3/4 inch on a side. Cut 
  <b>CARROTS</b> into large chunks. Dice <b>BELL PEPPER</b> about 3/4 
  inch. Mix all.</li>
<li>Put <b>Beef</b>, <b>Onions</b>, <b>Garlic</b>, <b>Tomato mix</b>, 
  and <b>Bay Leaves</b> into a large Dutch Oven.</li>
<li>Add <b>Stock</b> and bring to a boil. Simmer slowly, tightly covered, 
  for about 1 hour if beef is Chuck, 1-1/3 hour if Round.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into largish chunks. Hold in 
  a bowl of cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Grind together <b>All Seasonings</b>.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> has cooked its allotted time (see above), add 
  <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Seasonings</b>. Bring back to a boil and 
  continue to simmer for another hour.</li>
<li>Lift out <b>Beef</b> and set aside to let cool.</li>
<li>Strain out <b>Vegetables</b> and set aside.</li>
<li>De-fat <b>Sauce</b> using your gravy separator. Put in a sauce pan 
  and simmer down to about 1/3, or whatever looks right for your stew. 
  When reduced, stir in <b>Wine Vinegar</b>.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is thoroughly cold you can slice it neatly with a 
  razor sharp slicing knife. Slice across the grain so it isn't stringy. 
  For a party dish cut the pieces smaller.</li>
<li>Arrange <b>Vegetables</b> in a deep ovenproof dish. Arrange <b>Beef</b> 
  embedded in the center. Pour sauce over it all and slide into the oven 
  to reheat - see <a href="dmm_cowprst1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a> for alternative.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; I like a chuck roast for this 
  recipe. A round roast can be used, but will take a little more time and 
  is a bit leaner.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use Red Potatoes, but White 
  Rose would also work. Don't use "Yukon Gold" type potatoes, they turn 
  to mush if cooked a little too long.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Saffron:</h3> &nbsp; Spanish recipes tend to use saffron in 
  everything, in quantities difficult to afford in North America (Spain 
  is a major saffron producer). You may want to cut back to a large 
  pinch depending on how flush you are feeling.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; If you have Sherry Vinegar, 
  use 2 t (it's stronger than regular wine vinegar), otherwise 1 T red.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Browning:</h3> &nbsp; This is traditionally done in the Dutch 
  oven the meat will be roasted in, but this can be difficult, depending 
  on the shape and size of the meat compared to the pot. It may be more 
  practical to brown in a large heavy pan. Pour the fat into the Dutch 
  oven and de-glaze the pan with the wine / water mix. I fry in an 
  Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">Kadhai</a> which gives me the 
  best possible control. In any case, browning such a large lump is 
  dangerous (hot oil can splash if it slips when turning), so it needs 
  to be done by a careful, sober  adult with no children hanging around. 
  If your SO can meet that description it will free you to do other 
  tasks.  A 3 pound lump of beef browns in about 20 minutes, a bit 
  longer for larger lumps.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Since I serve this at buffet 
  parties, I arrange it in a shallow coverable electric pan, vegetables 
  around the edge and meat, sliced and cut into modest size pieces, in the 
  center. Pour in hot sauce and heat with the pan set at "low". When it 
  starts to bubble, turn it down to "warm" (about 165&deg;F/74&deg;C 
  is safe). Keep covered so it doesn't dry out.</li>
