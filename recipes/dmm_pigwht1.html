In Spain, this stew is often made in the spring when tender shoots of 
Wild Fennel can be picked, but here we use Bulb Fennel, which works well 
enough.

<p>Note that the Potatoes and Bell Pepper are not always included, 
but I find they work well for buffet service and help make this a 
delicious stew that will be liked by all - except, of course, Jews, 
Muslims, Vegetarians and the Gluten Free.</p>

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>WHEAT BERRIES</b> 8 hours minimum, preferably overnight, 
    with water to cover. Drain.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>WHITE BEANS</b> with 1/2 T Salt (yes, salt) and water to 
    cover, 8 hours or overnight.</li>
  <li>Simmer <b>Beans</b> in water to cover until just tender through, 
    then drain. They'll get at least another 20 minutes of cooking (see 
    <a href="dmm_pigwht1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into chunks about 3/4 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium. Cut <b>FENNEL</b> lengthwise into to 
    thin slivers about 1-1/2 inches long. Hopefully you have some fronds 
    you can set aside to use as a garnish (many stores trim bulbs too 
    close).</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> (if used) and cut into about 1/2 inch dice. 
    Hold in cold water until needed.
  <li>Using your propane torch, char the skin of the <b>BELL PEPPER</b> 
    (if used) black and brush it off under cold running water. Cut into 
    dice about 1/3 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MORCILlA</b> and <b>CHORIZO</b> as desired. Perhaps split 
    in half or quarters depending on diameter and slice about 1/4 inch 
    thick. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Drain <b>Wheat</b> and place in a pot of sufficient size for the 
    whole recipe. Stir in 8 c <b>Water</b> and the <b>Pork</b>. Bring 
    to a boil and skim off any foam that rises.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion</b> and <b>Fennel</b>.  Simmer covered about 
    1 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Beans</b>, <b>Morcilla mix</b>, <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>. If using, stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Bell 
    Pepper</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer covered 20 minutes 
    or until beans are tender (wheat berries will remain chewy).</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with Fennel Fronds. &nbsp; Note: this 
    recipe reheats well, but will need a bit more boiled water 
    added as it tends to thicken.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Wheat Berries:</h3> &nbsp;  Whole wheat berries 
  are called for (peeled wheat, pelted wheat). If you are in an awful 
  hurry (and using canned beans) you could use coarse bulgur with some 
  degradation of texture and flavor. It would go in with the Potatoes 
  and Chorizo, not with the Pork and Onions.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>White Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These should be large 
  white beans, White Kidney Beans, Cannellini, or the like, but 
  the largest we can easily find around here are Great Northern, and 
  they work well.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat 
  removed. Cushion Meat or Leg is fine here.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar all 
  purpose potatoes work well here. Avoid Yukon Gold types which turn to 
  mush if cooked a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Morcilla de Cebolla</h3> &nbsp; This is a Spanish 
  blood sausage that is likely right at hand in the Spanish kitchen - but 
  not here in North America. <u>Do not</u> use Morcilla de Arroz (with 
  rice) as it swells and disintegrates. Morcilla can be ordered from 
  La Espa&ntilde;ola Meats (West Coast) and other domestic sausage makers, 
  or from La Tienda (East Coast) which sells imported at a higher price. 
  If you can't get Morcilla, use a French Boudin Noir or English Black 
  Pudding (also blood sausages). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chorizo:</h3> &nbsp; <u>NOT</u> Mexican chorizo, 
  but also not a hard dry Spanish chorizo. This needs to be Chorizo de 
  Balbao or a similar semi-cured cooking chorizo. I buy Balbao from the 
  freezer cases in Philippine markets (USA made), but it can be ordered 
  from Spanish sausage makers like La Espa&ntilde;ola Meats. The photo 
  example was made with Chorizo Riojano. If you can't find a Spanish 
  sausage, use a firm, mildly hot pork sausage.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The main change I've made to 
  the pattern recipe is in handling the beans. I soak them with salt, 
  which makes the skins more penetrable, resulting in more even soaking. 
  In the pattern recipe the beans go in with the wheat and pork, but I 
  cook them separately. This gives better control of softness, and 
  discarding the cooking water also discards some of the fart causing 
  indigestible sugars. There is still plenty of bean flavor in this 
  recipe, in fact, more might not be as good. The Bell Pepper and 
  Potatoes are not my addition, they are often included in Spain.</li>
