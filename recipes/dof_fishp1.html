<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol>
<li>Filet your <b>FISH</b> and make the <b>FISH STOCK</b>, if you don't 
  already have it.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol start="2">
<li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into bite size pieces.</li>
<li>Use a vegetable peeler to remove zest of <b>BITTER ORANGE</b> (or 
  substitutes) in thin strips as large as you can get them. Cut and 
  squeeze out all juice, reserving both zest and juice (separately).</li>
<li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and cut in half crosswise. Cap and core 
  <b>BELL PEPPER</b> and cut into largish pieces. Cut <b>TOMATO</b> 
  in half crosswise. Mix all <b>Vegie mix</b> items.</li>
<li>Peel <b>GARLIC CLOVE</b> and run a metal skewer through it lengthwise. 
  Rotate over a burner flame until soft and lightly browned. Don't get 
  it too close or it will burn (if the pointy tip burns, cut it off). 
  </li>
<li><u>IF</u> &nbsp; using <b>SAFFRON</b>, soak threads in hot water for 
  at least 15 minutes. Saffron must not touch oil until fully soaked.</li>
<li><u>IF</u> &nbsp; using <b>POTATOES</b>, peel and cut into 1/2 inch 
  dice. Put in a saucepan with water to cover well, bring to a boil and 
  cook until tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
<li><u>IF</u> &nbsp; using <b>SHRIMP</b> cut them in half if large.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="9">
<li>In a 3 quart or larger sauce pan, place <b>Fish Stock</b>, 
  <b>Vegie mix</b> and <b>Orange Zest</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
  covered for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Strain out <b>Vegies</b> reserving both Vegies and Stock. Remove 
  and discard <b>Orange Zest</b>, <b>Tomato Skins</b> and <b>Parsley</b>.
  </li>
<li>Place <b>BREAD</b> in a shallow bowl and pour over just enough of 
  the <b>Stock</b> to moisten. Let stand for 30 seconds or so.</li>
<li>Place <b>Vegie mix</b>, <b>Garlic</b>, and <b>Bread</b> in a food 
  processor or blender with enough <b>Stock</b> to run it to a 
  pur&eacute;e. Pass the pur&eacute;e through a strainer or food mill 
  to remove annoying Pepper Skins.</li>  
<li>Return to the pan all <b>Stock</b> and the <b>Vegie Pur&eacute;e</b> 
  along with <b>Salt</b>. <u>IF</u> using, stir in <b>Saffron</b> 
  and/or <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Fish</b>, and <b>Shrimp</b> (if using). Bring back to a 
  boil and simmer just until the fish can be flaked (10 minutes max).
  </li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Orange Juice</b> and take off the heat. Serve hot, 
  garnished with Parsley.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; It is always best to buy 
  your fish whole (the only way you can be sure you're getting the kind 
  of fish you're paying for), and the heads, fins, bones, and sometimes 
  skins can be used to make excellent fish stock. You can have the fish 
  man scale and clean the fish (done free in all the Asian markets here 
  in Southern California). For details see our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fillets ready to add to the soup. 
  The pattern recipe suggests Cod or Hake which are not common here in 
  Southern California. The fish you choose should be ones that hold up 
  well in wet cooking. The photo example was made with Tilapia, which 
  holds together just well enough. For guests I'd likely use Golden 
  Pompano, common around here and very good. It can be used skin off 
  or skin on, and makes excellent fish stock. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bitter Orange:</h3> &nbsp; [Sour Orange, Seville Orange, 
  Bigarade; <i>Citrus aurantium</i>] &nbsp; For details and substitutions 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ci_osourz.html"><b>Bitter Orange</b></a> 
  page. &nbsp; <b>IF</b> using the Potato Option, I'd also include 
  the juice from another 1/2 Bitter Orange.</li>
<li id="#04">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Either Green or Red can be used. I use a 
  Red Anaheim if available, as it will not add an excessive amount of 
  heat.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; If Using - White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Without options, this recipe makes a fine 
  light soup course (about 1 cup per person), though some Shrimp 
  certainly wouldn't hurt. If you want a more substantial soup to serve 
  in larger portions, use the Potato Option. I would always use the 
  Potato Option if serving buffet style. The photo example was made 
  with Shrimp but no Potatoes.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The name translates literally as "Dog Soup", 
  but is derived from "el perro", Andalusian slang for a shipboard cook.
  Some recipes allow for a pinch of Chili Powder, but not more. The 
  Potato and Shrimp are not "official" parts of the recipe, but used by 
  cooks when appropriate.</li>
