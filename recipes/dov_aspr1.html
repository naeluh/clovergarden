Most Asparagus Soups are disappointing - this one is not. A 
substantial soup, it will serve 3 to 4 as a soup course, or two for 
a light lunch, with some bread and beer.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel tough ends of <b>ASPARAGUS</b> (cut off any that are just 
    too tough and fibrous). Weight is after trimming and peeling. 
    Cut the Asparagus into 1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> with the side of your prep knife.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a suitable pan (a 2 quart saut&eacute; is perfect), heat 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> over moderate heat until 
    just translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and <b>Asparagus</b>, then the <b>Stock</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and run in a Blender or Food Processor until 
    smooth.</li>
  <li>Clean the pan and put the <b>Soup</b> back in. Stir in <b>Cheese</b>, 
    and <b>Salt</b> if needed (depends on how salty your stock is). 
    Reheat stirring over gentle heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished as desired. Accompany with bread.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asparagus, Green:</h3> &nbsp; Moderate size, fresh and very green 
  is best for color and flavor. Weight given is "recipe ready" after 
  removing tough ends (but only the very toughest), and peeling the rest 
  of the thick end. You will need to start with at least a pound.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Manchego Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; This is a fairly common Spanish hard 
  cheese. The pattern recipe calls for it in the ingredients, but in the 
  steps it calls for "Parmesan", so we can assume that's a suitable 
  substitute.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Vegetable stock for Vegetarian, or Chicken Stock 
  if you don't care about that. The photo specimen was made with two 
  cups of water and a teaspoon of Vegeta powder, and it was fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; A few cooked Asparagus Tips is nice, or 
  Croutons, or chopped Herbs of choice.</li>
