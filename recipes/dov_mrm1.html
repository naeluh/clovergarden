An interestingly flavored soup showing a Medieval ancestry and Moorish 
influence. It can be made vegetarian as easily as not. While an elegant 
soup course, as with most smooth soups, it is not well suited to being 
a feature dish.

<p>Having little use for elegant soup courses, I found it easy to make 
it more robust (see <a href="dov_mrm1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>) and it will serve 
more people this way. It was quite successful at a recent party.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>MUSHROOMS</b> small,</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cover the <b>PORCINI</b> with boiling water and set aside until 
    well softened. Chop small and return to the liquid.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
  <li>If using, peel <b>POTATOES</b> and dice about 1/2 inch or even 
    smaller. Put in a pan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer until potatoes are just done through. Drain and set aside.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a pan large enough for the recipe, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Onion mix</b>, stirring over moderate heat until very lightly 
    golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in fresh <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry stirring over moderate 
    heat until liquid exuded by Mushrooms has evaporated (they will 
    start sticking to the pan at this point).</li>
  <li>Stir in , <b>Porcini</b> (including liquid) and <b>Sherry</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then simmer slowly for 5 minutes. Let cool a little.
  <li>Run <b>Mushroom mix</b> in a food processor until quite smooth. 
    Return to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, a little at a time to start to avoid lumps, 
    then all of it. Stir in <b>Thyme</b>. Bring to a simmer for about 
    20 minutes.</li>
  <li>A little at a time, stir some hot soup into <b>Almond Butter</b> 
    until it is smooth and quite liquid (about as much soup as there is 
    Almond Butter). Stir into the soup. Season with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.
  <LI>Bring to a simmer, carefully because it can easily boil over at 
    this point. Simmer about 5 minutes or so - or, if using, 
    stir in cooked <b>Potatoes</b> and simmer for about 10 minutes. 
    Adjust liquid as needed.</li>
  <li>Fish out the Thyme Sprigs and stir in <b>Parsley</b>. Give it 
    another minute simmering and then serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; It is best to use several 
  different mushrooms if possible, preferably ones with distinct mushroom 
  flavor. Two or three fresh shiitakes can help, but not too many - their 
  flavor is strong and very distinctive. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Porcini:</h3> &nbsp; 1/4 ounce is about 2 T 
  crushed small - but good ones are too tough to crush, so you'll probably 
  have to "guesstimate" it. These are Dried Mushrooms, available at 
  Italian markets and often regular supermarkets (at very high prices), 
  but there is no real substitute. They are more economically bought 
  on-line. They store well, so you can buy an economical quantity.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  "chicken stock or water". Water sounds a bit weak, but I may want 
  to serve this as a vegetarian dish at a buffet party, so I used our 
  <a href="giv_stockv1.html"><b>Vegetable Stock</b></a>, which works well.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Almonds;</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for blanched almonds 
  lightly roasted and ground fine - but modern home equipment is not 
  capable of grinding oily nuts fine enough, and the dish will turn out 
  very unpleasantly gritty. A Mexican <a href="../ke/mortar.html#stone">
  <b>Metate y Mano</b></a> or Indian Sil and Batta would work, but few 
  North American homes have those. Smooth Almond Butter is the way to 
  go - Trader Joe's has it in salted and unsalted (I used unsalted).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  all purpose potatoes work well here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Variation:</h3> &nbsp; Needing a more robust soup, 
  I added potatoes cut into dice. This, of course, blows it out of the 
  Medieval era because they didn't have potatoes in Europe or Africa 
  then, but I find they greatly improve the usefulness of this soup.</li>
