This recipe is entirely worth it, but a bit of a production. Fortunately 
it can be can be done in steps, even starting several days in advance, 
through step #9. Leftovers can be reheated in the oven.

<p>I have made changes from the pattern recipe and traditional Spanish 
practice for reasons explained in <a href="dsg_ricesq1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>. This 
dish was very well liked at a recent buffet party.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hrs 45 min - 1 hr 40 min work)
<ol>
<li>Clean <b>SQUID</b>, peel skins and cut into about 3/4 inch squares. 
  include tentacles cut free from their base. See <a href="dsg_ricesq1.html#01">
  <b>Note-1</b></a> for instructions.</li>
<li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> (reserving the shells for the broth). De-vein 
  and cut into thirds if medium, halves if small and quarters if very 
  large.</li>
<li>Clean your <b>FISH</b> and fillet it. Use the fillets for some other 
  recipe.</li>
<li>Slice <b>Tomato</b> thick. Mix all <b>Broth Items</b> with <b>Fish</b> 
  heads, bones and fins. Bring to a low simmer for about 40 minutes. 
  Strain and de-fat (use your gravy separator). You want to end up with 
  3-1/2 cups, so add boiled water to make up the difference, or simmer 
  down as needed.</li>
<li>In a mortar or mini-prep processor, mash 3 cl <b>GARLIC</b> with 
  the <b>Saffron Threads</b>. If using the mini-prep you can add 1/4 
  cup of the <b>Broth</b> to make that possible.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
  water, peel, core and chop small.</li>
<li>Crush 5 cl <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
<ol start="8">
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (see <a href="dsg_ricesq1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>) 
  heat <b>Olive Oil</b> over rather mild flame. Stir in <b>Rice</b> 
  (<u>Do</u> <u>Not</u> rinse the Rice). Fry stirring constantly until 
  rice is a light golden color.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Squid</b> and <b>Shrimp</b>, the 5 cl <b>Garlic</b>, 
  <b>Tomato</b> and <b>Paprika</b>. Fry stirring constantly until liquid 
  has evaporated and it is back to frying (you'll start getting a little 
  fond sticking to the pan).</li>
<li>Stir in 3-1/2 cups <b>Broth</b> (3-1/4 if 1/4 cup was used for the 
  Saffron mix), the <b>Wine</b> and the <b>Saffron mix</b>. Bring to 
  a boil and cook stirring over moderate heat until the rice is no 
  longer soupy, but there is plenty of water left. <b>Salt</b> to taste.
  </li>
<li>Here you may choose a method. &nbsp; <u>My Method</u> is to cover 
  tightly and turn to a bare simmer for 10 minutes. You may uncover 
  <u>once</u> at 8 minutes to check and stir, recovering immediately. 
  Turn off the heat at 10 minutes and let the rice rest for 10 minutes 
  without lifting the lid. &nbsp;  <u>Spanish Method</u> is to place 
  uncovered in an oven preheated to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C for 10 minutes. 
  If all is just right you'll get tender rice with a slightly crispy top. 
  Pull out, cover tightly with foil and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp; These are easily available in 
  most Asian fish markets, particularly Philippine fish markets here in 
  Los Angeles. For details see our <a href="../ingred/seasquidc.html">
  <b>Cleaning, Cutting &amp; Cooking Small Squid</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; These should be "shell on" 
  so you can use the shells in the fish broth. I suggest using headless 
  shrimp as the heads will result in a rather strong shrimpy flavor and 
  red color. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/seashrimp.html"><b>Shrimp &amp; Prawns</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  a "small whiting" (a sort of poor man's cod), but we don't have those 
  in Southern California.  The closest would probably be a small Pollock, 
  which we do have, but I used a 14 ounce Pompano, with the fillets 
  reserved for another use. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (veeeeery 
  large page).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Frying Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are thin walled, usually 
  yellow-green, not hot peppers, sold here in Los Angeles as Armennian 
  or Hungarian peppers. They are also known as Turkish peppers, but we 
  wouldn't dare call them that here in the Western capital of Armenia. 
  My local produce market didn't have any this week so I used 1/2 an 
  Anaheim pepper with the veins cut out to reduce hotness. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Saffron:</h3> &nbsp; The Spanish are rather 
  liberal with Saffron (it is produced there). The pattern recipe calls 
  for 1/8 teaspoon, but that would set you back something like US $7.00 
  around here, so I call for a more conservative amount.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Do not rinse the rice for 
  Spanish dishes of this sort. Spanish short grain is preferred, but 
  lacking that, Italian, Egyptian or California (Koda Rose or similar) 
  rice will work. Technically, these are all medium grain rice, but 
  popularly called "short grain".</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Use real Spanish or Hungarian Paprika, not 
  that supermarket stuff that has less flavor than sawdust.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Pan and Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  calls for a mild steel paella pan about 18 inches across, but few 
  American households have one of those on hand - and it wouldn't work 
  on our stoves anyway. A large paella pan only works well over a wood 
  fire or a special, very wide gas burner. I use a 3-1/2 quart multi-ply 
  saut&eacute; pan. It's deeper, with rather different cooking 
  properties, and coverable, so I modified the cooking sequence some, 
  and skip finishing in the oven.  Here in Sunny Southern California 
  we don't fire up an oven unless we really need to. Also, I thought 
  the pattern recipe's sequence of frying the squid and shrimp before 
  the rice wouldn't work well - and it didn't. With Chicken and Beef 
  the Spanish do this, brown the meat, then stir in the rice to brown 
  lightly, but they usually put the squid in later, as I do here. I 
  have made a double recipe in a large, coverable electric skillet, 
  and that worked well.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Prep Times:</h3> &nbsp; Prep Squid: 25 minutes. You can reduce this 
  to 5 minutes by buying cleaned frozen squid and squid tentacles from 
  an Asian market. Prep Shrimp: 8 min. Prep fish: 25 min.</li>
