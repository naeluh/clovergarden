From Aragon, in northeast Spain, comes this mix of beans, rice 
and potatoes - typical of the region. This side dish is easy to 
make, substantial, and almost flavorful enough to stand on its own.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>WHITE BEANS</b> with 1/2 T Salt (yes, salt) and water to 
    cover, 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hrs -  20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Simmer <b>Beans</b> in water to cover until just tender through, 
    then drain. They'll get at least another 20 minutes of cooking (see 
    <a href="dsp_bnrice1.html#06">Note-6</a>).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch dice. Hold in 
    cold water until needed.

  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar, place 
    1-3/4 c <b>Water</b>, the <b>Onion mix</b>, <b>Potatoes</b>, 
    <b>Bay Leaf</b>, <b>Paprika</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Olive Oil</b> and 
    <b>Beans</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer about 10 
    minutes. &nbsp; Note: if your Beans seem a little too soft, put them 
    in with the rice instead of here.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice</b> and simmer covered until rice is fully cooked, 
    about 20 minutes. &nbsp; Note: the dish should not be dry, still a 
    little soupy when the rice is done. Adjust as needed by simmering 
    with the lid off or adding boiling water as needed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. &nbsp; Note: if this dish needs to be re-heated, 
    reheat covered in a 300&deg;F/150&deg;C oven. It'll be a little 
    drier, but still good.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>White Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These can be small or 
  medium beans. The photo example is made with Great Northern beans. 
  Some writers allow red beans but most insist on white.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  all purpose potatoes work well here. Avoid Yukon Gold type because 
  they turn to mush if cooked a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Spanish or 
  Hungarian Paprika, not that sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the 
  supermarkets. Both Spain and Hungary have Hot Paprika, but if you have 
  only the regular, add a bit of Cayenne to the recipe to sharpen it.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Most specialty Spanish rice is specific to 
  Paella, but this recipe is not Paella and a California type rice 
  such as Kokuho Rose will work fine (the Spanish, like the Italians, 
  use medium grain rice). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html"><b>Rice</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The main change I've made to 
  the pattern recipe is in handling the beans. I soak them with salt, 
  which makes the skins more penetrable, resulting in more even soaking 
  and cooking. In the pattern recipe, soaked but uncooked beans go in 
  the pan with water first, until almost tender, then the rest of the 
  ingredients go in as above. Cooking the beans separately gives better 
  control of their softness, and discarding the cooking water also 
  discards some of the fart causing indigestible sugars. There is still 
  plenty of bean flavor in this recipe. Also I have cut the garlic back 
  from 10 cloves to 7, because Americans aren't accustomed to quite that 
  much garlic.</li>
