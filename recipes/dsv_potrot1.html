<b><u>DoAhead Option</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Can be done a day or more 
  ahead and refrigerated. (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut as desired. For the photo they were sliced a 
  little less than 3/8 inch thick and into short sticks (See <a href="dsv_potrot1.html#02">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a>).</li>
<li>Bring 2 quarts of <b>Water</b> to a boil and add 2 Tablespoons of 
  <b>Vinegar</b>. Dump in the <b>Potatoes</b> and boil until just cooked 
  through. You will notice the outside surfaces will be slightly hardened by 
  the vinegar, for better frying. Drain and refresh with cold water. Drain 
  very well (I use a salad spinner).</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
<ol start="3">
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in quarters lengthwise, then fairly thin crosswise.</li>
<li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>. Set 1 teaspoon aside for sprinkling.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
<ol start="6">
<li>Prepare everything you need for frying <b>EGGS</b>. See <a href="dsv_potrot1.html#02">
  <b>Eggs</b></a>.</li>
<li>Break the <b>Eggs</b> into small shallow bowls so you know the yolks 
  are unbroken and they are ready to be fried.</li>
<li>Select a suitable vessel to deep fry the Potatoes in. Place 2 Tablespoons 
  of oil in it and fry the <b>Onions</b> until they are barely translucent and 
  still fairly crisp. Scoop out onto paper toweling to drain </li>
<li>Add the deep fry oil to the pan and bring it up to about 
  360&deg;F/180&deg;C. Fry <b>Potatoes</b> in two batches. Fry stirring until 
  just light golden - they will darken a bit when cooled, and the Seasoning 
  will darken them more. Scoop out into a large mixing bowl lined with Paper 
  Towels and keep warm.</li>
<li>Pull the Paper Towels from under the <b>Potatoes</b> and mix in the 
  <b>Seasonings mix</b> and <b>Onions</b>. Distribute into serving bowls. 
  and garnish with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
<li>Fry the <b>Eggs</b>. They <b><u>MUST</u></b> be fried, covered, "Sunny 
  Side Up", with whites just barely set and yolks completely liquid. Serve 
  immediately. See <a href="dsv_potrot1.html#02"><b>Eggs</b></a>.</li>
<li>Place an <b>Egg</b> on each serving of <b>Potatoes</b> and very lightly 
 sprinkle a little of the reserved <b>Seasoning</b> over it.</li>
<li>Serve hot. Immediately upon serving, the egg yolk is broken open so the 
  liquid yolk runs down into the Potatoes as a sauce.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>General:</h3> &nbsp; Like many very simple dishes, this one can be 
  tricky. The potatoes are reasonably forgiving, but the eggs are not 
  forgiving at all - they must be exactly right. The recipe given here 
  is similar to how it is served in many Spanish Tapas Bars, and is one 
  of the more demanding presentations - see also <a href="dsv_potrot1.html#06">
  <b>Variations</b></a>.
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Russets are preferred for frying, but an "all 
  purpose" potato like White Rose will work OK. Maybe even Yukon Gold 
  type will work. Cutting into sticks is most common, but you can use other 
  shapes. Baby Potatoes (white or red) can be used simply sliced 1/4 inch 
  thick, skin on. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a>. page</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; The Spanish aren't into really hot, so 
  Korean flake is a good choice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The amount given presumes you will fry in two 
  batches, which won't take much more time than a single batch. A single 
  batch would take 2 cups of Oil. I use Pure Olive Oil which can stand 
  fairly high temperatures. The Oil can be filtered through a paper towel 
  and used for other frying.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking the Eggs is critical - if they are not right 
  the dish is ruined. You must have a cover to set over the eggs as soon as 
  they are on the heat, or the yolks will be ruined long before the whites 
  are set through. I use an 11x11 inch electric skillet with glass cover, 
  set to 330&deg;F/165&deg;C, checked with an infra-red thermometer. It'll 
  do 4 eggs at once. With this set-up, the Eggs are ready in 2 to 2-1/2 
  minutes from hitting the surface. Be sure to let electric pans preheat, 
  at first their temperatures are very wild. Preheat with the cover on so 
  it is warm too.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; As is so often the case with simple traditional 
  recipes, this one is made in many variations.	It is thought to have 
  originated in the Spanish Canary Islands, where it was favored by the poor. 
  It is now popular all over Spain, particularly in Madrid. In its purest 
  form, still popular, it is just SSU Eggs over fried potatoes, but today it 
  is most often elaborated with toppings.
    <ul>
    <li>Today, some Tapas Bars greatly simplify preparation by serving the Egg 
      over Potato Chips. If you do that, try to use one of the more "natural" 
      varieties and without flavorings which would conflict with the Seasoning 
      mix.</li>
    <li>Some cooks fry the potatoes only until cooked through, not browned. 
      If you do this skip the boiling with vinegar step.</li>
    <li> At least one Spanish cook admits that when she does this recipe at 
      home, she simply boils the potatoes and dresses with some Extra Virgin 
      Olive Oil.</li>
    <li><b>Toppings</b> &nbsp; The recipe given here is vegetarian, but it 
      is very common in Spain to top with small pieces of fried Chorizo, 
      Chistorra, Bacon, or with very thinly slice Serrano Ham (not fried). 
      A topping of marinated red peppers would be good for vegetarian. </li>
    </ul></li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Health</h3> &nbsp; Eggs fried as given here are considered by the FDA 
  to be "undercooked". This is no problem here in "over regulated" California, 
  where sickness from home cooked eggs is practically unknown, but if you 
  live in one of those "business friendly" Red States (or if you know your 
  immune system is compromised), you might want to make it topped with 
  "pasteurized egg" (more expensive), or even scrambled eggs.</li>
