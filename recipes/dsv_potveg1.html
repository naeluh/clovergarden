This casserole, from Mallorca, Spain, is great as a side dish or, 
with rice, a light vegetarian main dish. It's a bit of a hassle for two, 
but very good for larger groups.

<p>In Mallorca the ingredients would all be fried, making the dish a 
bit oilier than we would like today. See <a href="dsv_potveg1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> 
for preparation details.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</li>
<li>Cut <b>EGGPLANT</b> into 3/8 inch slices and arrange on an oiled baking 
  sheet. Brush with <b>Olive Oil</b> on both sides and Sprinkle lightly 
  with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bake at 400&deg;F until cooked through, 
  10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut lengthwise in half if small, quarters if 
  larger. Slice crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Put in a saucepan 
  with water to cover, bring to a boil and simmer until cooked through. 
  Drain well.</li>
<li>Drain <b>TOMATOES</b>, reserving the juice. Chop fine and return to the 
  juice.</li>
<li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your propane torch and rub the skins 
  off under running water. Core and slice into strips about 1/2 inch 
  wide and half the pepper height in length.</li>
<li>Slice <b>ZUCCHINI</b> about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
<li>Chop some more <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
<ol start="10">
<li>Heat 1 T <b>Olive Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and add  
  <b>Zucchini</b>, <b>Peppers</b> and just 1 teaspoon of the <b>Garlic</b>. 
  Sprinkle with a little <b>Salt</b> and fry tumbling until all is coated 
  with oil. You can then cover and steam the vegetables in their own juices 
  over low flame, tumbling now and then, until Zucchini is just cooked 
  through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>Heat 1 T <b>Olive Oil</b> in the saut&eacute; pan and stir in 
  remaining <b>Garlic</b>. Fry stirring for a few seconds, then stir 
  in <b>Paprika</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Parsley</b>. Cover and 
  simmer, stirring now and then, until tomatoes are very soft.</li>
<li>Tumble the <b>Potatoes</b> with a bit of <b>Olive Oil</b> and <b>Salt</b> 
  to taste.</li>
<li>Oil a 2 quart casserole or baking dish. Layer in the <b>Potatoes</b>. 
  Next layer is the <b>Zucchini mix</b> and then the <b>Eggplants</b>. 
  Finally, pour the <b>Tomato mix</b> over the top.</li>
<li>Slip casserole into the oven and bake at 400&deg;F for about 20 
  minutes (see <a href="dsv_potveg1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
<li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Use a small diameter 
  eggplant such as Italian or Japanese.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar waxy potatoes work 
  well in this recipe. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly 
  turn to mush if cooked beyond the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Spanish or Hungarian paprika, 
  not that sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Details:</h3> &nbsp;  To keep oiliness down to a 
  modern level, the eggplant is oven roasted rather than fried. The 
  pattern recipe calls for salting the eggplant slices and draining them 
  in a colander to "drain their bitter juices". Since I've never detected 
  bitter juices in eggplants I don't bother. If, however, you decide to 
  be "authentic" and fry the eggplants, the salting is useful - it cuts 
  down the amount of oil the eggplants will absorb. The pattern recipe 
  calls for microwaving the potatoes instead of frying them for the 
  same reason, but having no kids demanding instant gratification, I 
  don't need a microwave, so I simmer them.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; I have made this up 
  completely except the final oven heating and refrigerated overnight 
  (and most of the following day). Then put it in the oven, where it'll 
  take a lot longer than 20 minutes to come up to a simmer. I then 
  spoon it all out into an electric warming pan for buffet service.
