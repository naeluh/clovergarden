In the Czech Republic, all the better pubs have a big jar of pickled 
eggs and a big jar of these pickled sausages - they are extremely 
popular with beer.

<p>This recipe is scaled for a 2 quart (8 cup / 1/2 gallon / 2 litre) 
jar.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5+ days - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>IF your <b>SAUSAGES</b> have thick or artificial casings, strip 
    them off.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Sausages</b> as needed to fit in the jar you are using, 
    but not too short. Make a lengthwise cut about 2/3 way through the 
    sausage pieces.</li>
  <li>Spread <b>Mustard</b> in the cut - not too much.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> lengthwise into long, very thin slices. Pack a 
    few strips into the cut on each sausage piece. They go in easiest 
    with the ends pointing down.</li>
  <li>Cover the bottom of a sterile jar with the remaining <b>Onion 
    slices</b>. Pack the sausage pieces into the jar, fairly tightly. 
    Put remaining <b>Onion</b> slices on top.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b> and bring to a simmer in a non-reactive 
    pan. Simmer slowly for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let <b>Pickle</b> cool just a few degrees and pour over the 
    <b>Sausages</b> until the jar is full. As you go, spoon the spices 
    into the jar. If you have excess pickle, keep it to replenish the 
    jar when you pull the first sausage for testing (bring it back to 
    a boil first).</li>
  <li>Keep in a cool place or in the refrigerator - depending on your 
    water to vinegar ratio. They should be OK to eat in about 5 days 
    (again, depending on your vinegar ratio) but 7 days is better and 
    14 days is considered best. Even with a high vinegar ratio I'd 
    refrigerate after 7 days, but with low vinegar you need to 
    refrigerate from the start.</li> 
  <li>Serve with Czech beer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; Polish Kielbasa is good, or any other 
  <u>smoked</u> sausage that is fully cooked, such as smoked bratwurst. 
  I buy sausages in the vacuum pack to be sure they are sterile.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pickle:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where recipes diverge rather widely. 
  My ratio is 3 to 1 in favor of vinegar. I have seen them as far as 1 
  to 3 favoring water to 4 to 1 favoring vinegar. The most important 
  difference, other than flavor, is curing temperature. At 1 to 3 
  favoring water, the jar must always be refrigerated. At 3 to 1 favoring 
  vinegar it can be un-refrigerated at least part of the time.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Most Czech recipes do not call for Chilis - 
  but I live in Southern California where a pickle without chilis is 
  unthinkable. I use 2 to 4 very hot Thai type chilis, but use your own 
  best judgement.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Background:</h3> &nbsp; Utopenci means "Drowned Men". The story is 
  that a miller invented this way of pickling smoked sausages, but later 
  drowned while trying to repair his water wheel - thus suggesting the 
  name. As with 99.87% of food stories and claims, it is unlikely to be 
  true. Others say it's just because the sausages looked drowned in the 
  vinegar - or we could get lewd here - but I'll leave that up to you.
