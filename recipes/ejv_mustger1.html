Tired of the absurd prices charged for tiny jars of German mustard? 
Make your own - without sacrificing flavor. It's easy, but does take 
a few days to fully mature. This recipe makes just shy of 2 cups at about 
US $1.00/cup.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 days - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Mix all three <b>Mustards</b> in a non-reactive bowl.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and chop small. Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    small. Chop <b>TARAGON</b> small.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cinnamon</b> and <b>Allspice</b>. Mix all <b>Seasonings</b> 
    together in a non-reactive sauce pan. Bring to a boil and simmer until 
    reduced by almost half.</li>
  <li>Let cool until you can stick a finger in it, then pour over 
    <b>Mustard mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Let stand covered in a cool place for 24 hours. Check after a couple 
    of hours to see that it isn't getting dry on the top. Add a little 
    more vinegar if needed.</li>
  <li>Process in a min-prep food processor or blender until you have the 
    consistency you want - generally you want a reasonable amount of 
    texture, not turned completely into paste. This can take a little time 
    in a mini-prep because those seeds are resistant even after a 24 hour 
    soak.</li>
  <li>Age in the refrigerator for about 3 days. It will tend to thicken 
    so add additional vinegar if needed to keep a spreadable texture.</li>
  <li>Turn out into jars and keep refrigerated.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mustard Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Coleman's is excellent 
  but pricey (about US $1.20 for this recipe). Many generics are just 
  fine. Don't think you can just grind up some yellow mustard seeds in 
  your spice grinder - the grind isn't nearly as fine, it won't be as 
  hot and the flavor is quite different.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tarragon:</h3> &nbsp; This measure is for Russian 
  tarragon (the kind sold in stores) and is enough to be noticeable. For 
  French tarragon use less, but you have to grow that yourself, which is 
  tricky. It doesn't grow from seed and poisons it's own ground, so it has 
  to be transplanted once a year or so - which is why it's not much 
  grown commercially.</li>
