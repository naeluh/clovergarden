This Czech chicken dish is intensely flavorful but a little bit of a 
production (it needs more than the usual attention during cooking), so 
is best used for special occasions.

<p>This dish can be made ahead right up to the last minute, which can be 
finished after bringing back to a simmer.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40  min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into the size chunks appropriate for how you will 
  be serving it (see <a href="emc_chkfric1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Not too small 
  because you have to pick it out of the vegetables - at least 1-1/2 
  inches for boneless meat.</li>
<li>Rub <b>Chicken</b> lightly with <b>Salt</b> and set aside.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice medium crosswise. 
  Peel <b>CARROT</b>, <b>PARSNIP</b> and <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and cut into 
  about 3/4 inch cubes. Mix all.</li>
<li>Dice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> fairly small. Fry over low heat in 1 T 
  <b>BUTTER</b> until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
<li>Squeeze <b>LEMON</b> for juice and hold aside. Cut a 1-1/2 inch 
  square of the Peel - yellow part only, and set aside.</li>
<li>Chop <b>Parsley</b> fine.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hr)
<ol start="7">
<li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan (it will just fit 
  in a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute;. Stir in 
  <b>Chicken</b>, then <b>Vegetable mix</b>. Boil off the water and fry 
  tumbling frequently until all is lightly browned. Watch the fond that 
  sticks to the pan - if it's getting too dark, go to the next step 
  right away. It should be reddish brown, not chocolate brown.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Pepper</b>, <b>Nutmeg</b>, reserved <b>Lemon Peel</b> and 
  1-1/2 c <b>Stock</b>. Cover tightly and simmer over low heat until 
  Chicken is tender (about 30 minutes), tumbling now and then and 
  checking liquid. Don't get it too tender or it'll fall apart when you 
  try to remove it from the vegetables.</li>
<li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> and set aside, leaving Vegetables in the pan.
  </li>
<li>Press the <b>Vegetables</b> in a wire strainer to recover all 
  liquid. Discard the solids. If the vegetables are too dry to strain 
  well, heat with a little extra water before straining. Scrape any pulp 
  that is on the underside of the strainer into the liquid and return the 
  liquid to the pan.</li>
<li>Melt 3 T <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Flour</b> in it, stirring almost 
  constantly, until it darkens a bit and you have a blonde roux.</li>
<li>Start stirring pan liquid into the <b>Roux</b> until you have a 
  smooth paste. Add boiling water if needed to get a loose sauce.</li>
<li>Return <b>Sauce</b> to the saut&eacute; pan and stir in 
  <b>Mushrooms</b>, <b>Parsley</b> and <b>Cream</b>. Simmer about 5 
  minutes and check salt to taste.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Chicken</b> back in. Adjust liquid with boiling water as 
  needed to get a rather loose sauce. Keep in mind it will thicken 
  considerably when cooled to serving temperature. Bring up to a simmer. 
  </li>
<li>When about ready to serve, stir in <b>Egg Yolk</b>, then 
  <b>Lemon Juice</b> to taste (I use 1 T or a little more). Serve 
  hot. This dish goes very well with steamed white rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless, 
  preferably thigh/leg meat for better texture and flavor. The pattern 
  recipe called for a whole 4 pound chicken cut up into serving pieces. 
  I find skinless, boneless easier to cook and much better for buffet 
  service. It can also be more equitably divided at the family table. 
  Skin-on may provide flavor, but I get that flavor from the stock (see 
  <a href="emc_chkfric1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; [Celeriac] This vegetable 
  is now available in many produce markets, at least here in California. 
  If you are not familiar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional  frying medium used by 
  Czechs. The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are 
  afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats 
  they urged us to use instead. It has a better health profile than 
  butter, and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. While Butter 
  is not traditional you can use it if you feel you can't use lard - or 
  you can use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or, better, Avocado oil.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for water, but stock 
  makes a richer dish. I make the stock with the skins and bones I strip 
  from the thighs I use for the meat. For details see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
