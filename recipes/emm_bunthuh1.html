"Colorful Chicken" is a fine light stew or soup, made from beef, or more 
often pork, but never from chicken. This recipe is based on one from 
Lower Saxony using beef, but pork can be used without changing the other 
ingredients.

<p>Why "Colorful Chicken"? Well, I found a detailed explanation, but it 
was totally unintelligible after passing through Google Translate.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 hrs, 30 min work)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>BEANS</b> overnight or at least 6 hours in plenty 
  of water with 1-1/2 T salt (see <a href="emm_bunthuh1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). 
  Drain.</li>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of all excess fat and cut into 1 inch cubes. 
  put in a pot of water and bring to a boil for about 2 minutes - drain 
  and rinse to remove all scum.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice crosswise about 1/4 
  inch wide.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
<li>Dice <b>CELERY</b> about 1/4 inch. Include leaves if available.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes and hold in cold 
  water until needed.</li>
<li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into squares about 1/2 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Cut <b>APPLES</b> into 3/4 inch chunks and hold in cold water until 
  needed.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="9">
<li>In a pot large enough to hold the whole recipe place <b>Beans</b> and 
  <b>Beef</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer slowly for about 45 min.</li>
<li>Meanwhile: fry <b>Bacon</b> in a heavy skillet over moderate heat until 
  translucent, then stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry until translucent. Add to 
  the pot.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is about 20 minutes from tender, stir in <b>Carrots</b>, 
  <b>Celery</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer until 
  Potatoes are done and Beef is tender.</li>
<li>When nearly ready to serve, stir in <b>Apples</b>, then <b>Vinegar</b>, 
  <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> to taste.</li>
<li>Garnish with <b>Parsley</b> and Serve hot with plenty of crusty bread.
  </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; If using Beef, Chuck Roast is a good choice. 
  Local markets have it reliably and often at a good price. Top round 
  roast is a little too lean, but it'll work well enough. You don't want 
  really tender cuts because they lack flavor.
  <br><h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; If using Pork everything is the same except 
  the par-boil in prep is optional, and in the final cooking go by the beans, 
  the pork will be tender more quickly than beef.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes work well or others that 
  stay reasonably firm. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes which turn to 
  mush if cooked just a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Recent experiments have shown that beans soaked 
  in salted water cook faster, are more tender, and fewer burst. 3 T per 
  pound of beans with sufficient soaking water is about right. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining 
  Dried BeansBeans</b></a> page.</li>
