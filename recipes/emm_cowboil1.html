This recipe makes both boiled beef but also plenty of stock. Supposedly, 
beef cooked this way was the favorite lunch of Emperor Franz Josef, and 
it has been popular in Austria ever since.

<p>A 3 pound roast will yield about 1 pound 10 ounces of cooked meat and 
2-1/2 to 3 quarts of stock.</p>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4+ hrs - 30 min work)
<ol>
<li>You'll need at least an 8-quart pot for this recipe.</li>
<li>Crack the <b>BEEF BONES</b> into pieces if you haven't had the 
  supplier saw them up (<a href="emm_cowboil1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of as much fat as you can.</li>
<li>Blanch and rinse both <b>Beef</b> and <b>Beef Bones</b> so your stock 
  will be clear. To do this put them into a pot with plenty of water to 
  cover (together or separately), bring to a rolling boil for 3 minutes, 
  then pour out the water and rinse any remaining scum off the meat and 
  bones. Clean the pot.</li>
<li>Put the <b>Beef Bones</b> only into a pot with 4 quarts (16 cups) of 
  fresh cold water and bring to a boil. Simmer covered for  at least 2 
  hours. Meanwhile, chill the beef with cold water and refrigerate until 
  needed.</li>
<li>Slice <b>ONION</b> thickly crosswise, chop <b>TURNIP</b> coarse, chop 
  <b>CARROTS</b> into 1/4 inch rounds. Carefully clean <b>LEEKS</b> 
  discarding green parts. Slice white and yellow parts about 1/4 inch thick. 
  Mix all.</li>   
<li>Add <b>Beef</b> to the pot as a single lump. Add <b>Vegetable Mix</b>, 
  <b>Peppercorns</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Simmer until meat is tender 
  (1-1/2 to 2 hours).</li>
<li>Pull <b>Beef</b> and cool. When cold it can be sliced and eaten with 
  horseradish, mustard or cucumber sauces, fried with onions and served 
  with sauce, used in sandwiches or diced for soups.</li>
<li>Strain out and discard all solids from the stock and de-fat. 
  (<a href="emm_cowboil1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).  For storage methods see our

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes call for Brisket. I usually use a 
  Chuck Roll Roast which local markets have reliably and at a good price. 
  Round is a little too lean, but it'll work well enough. Tough cuts are 
  best here for flavor. The fat goes in with the meat - much of the 
  flavor in meat fats is water soluable, and it's easy to remove at the 
  end using a gravy separator. For more details see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Bones:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for "marrow bones", but 
  what we generally find in markets here "soup bones" which are pretty 
  solid. If you buy a large bone your vendor should be asked to saw it 
  into chunks for you. Alternatively, use a sharp heavy meat cleaver 
  and drive it through the bones with a soft faced mallet. Always break 
  bones lengthwise as they are very hard to break crosswise.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>De-fat:</h3> &nbsp; Use your gravy separator. It'll take several 
  batches so pour off only 2/3 of what's in the separator before 
  refilling to keep fat out of the pour spout. An alternate to the gravy 
  separator is to refrigerate the stock to solidify the fat layer, 
  then peel it off, but who has that much room in their fridge?.</li>
