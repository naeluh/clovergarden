<b><u>Marinade</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 to 5 days - 20 min work)
<ol>
<li>Tie the <b>BEEF</b> with kitchen twine in several places. This not only 
  holds it together firmly but serves as a handle for turning it.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Mix <b>All Marinade Items</b>. Bring the 
  marinade to a rapid boil in an uncovered saucepan and simmer for 5 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Place <b>Beef</b> in a heatproof glass or ceramic bowl and pour the 
  hot marinade over it. Cool to near room temperature. If the marinade 
  doesn't cover add 50% water 50% vinegar (boil it first).</li>
<li>Chop <b>Parsley</b> fine and add to marinade. Cover (plate or plastic, 
  not foil) and keep in a cool place. Turn the beef every 8 hours for at 
  least 4 days (see <a href="emm_cowsauer1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-3/4 hrs - 40 min work)
<ol start="5">
<li>Start <b>RAISINS</b> soaking in water to cover.</li>
<li>Lift <b>Beef</b> from the marinade, drain it well and pat as dry as 
  you can with paper towels (so it will brown well).</li>
<li>Strain the <b>Marinade</b>, separately reserving both liquids and solids.
  </li>
<li>Rub <b>Beef</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, then dust with 
  <b>Flour</b>.</li>
<li>Melt <b>Butter</b> in a heavy Dutch oven and fry the <b>Beef</b> 
  over moderately high heat, turning until browned all over.</li>
<li>Remove <b>Beef</b> and set aside. Discard all drippings from the 
  Dutch oven.</li>
<li>Slice <b>CARROT</b> thin. Chop <b>Onion</b> medium. Mix.</li>
<li>In the Dutch Oven, melt <b>Butter</b> and add <b>Carrot mix</b>. Fry 
  stirring often until onions are lightly colored, then stir in reserved 
  <b>Solids</b> from the marinade and fry stirring a couple minutes more.
  </li>
<li>Return <b>Beef</b> to the pot. Add 2 cups <b>Liquid</b> from the 
  marinade (keep the rest) and the <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Bring to a boil, 
  turn down and simmer <u>slowly</u> covered for 3-1/2 to 4 hours until 
  the beef is tender (test with a long skewer).Turn now and then and check 
  liquid, maintaining it near its original level.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is tender, remove it and cover with foil to keep 
  warm.</li>
<li>Strain the <b>Liquid</b> and discard the solids. Defat the liquid (see 
  <a href="emm_cowsauer1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>). Pour back in the pot and add remaining 
  <b>Liquid</b> from the marinade, <b>Sugar</b>, <b>Red Wine</b>, 
  <b>Raisins</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. 
  Crumble in <b>Ginger Snaps</b> and bring to a boil over moderately high 
  heat. Boil gently until reduced by nearly half and a nice sauce 
  consistency.</li>
<li>Taste the <b>Sauce</b> and if too sour mix in <b>Current Jelly</b> 
  until you have the tartness you like.</li>
<li>Slice <b>Beef</b> about 1/4 inch thick across the grain. Arrange 
  overlapping slices on a platter and pour sauce over. Place any extra 
  sauce in a boat to pass separately. Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; The best cut for this recipe is some part of the 
  round. It needs to be a fairly tough cut to stand up to the long 
  marinade and simmering. On the other hand, it should be good 
  quality meat with at least some marbeling. A cut with a thin outer 
  layer of fat is best. &nbsp; <u>Important</u>: &nbsp; to be able 
  to slice the beef you must select a cut where the grain goes 
  lengthwise. A cut with crosswise grain tastes fine, but breaks up.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Wine #1:</h3> &nbsp; A dry German red is preferred, but 
  they're pretty scarce around here. Other good dry reds will work fine.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Wine #2:</h3> &nbsp; Again a German red wine is preferred, but 
  this one can be just medium dry. Other reds will also do fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Red Current Jelly:</b> &nbsp; This is not real common around 
  here, but an orange marmalade or similar can be substituted.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Marinating:</h3> &nbsp; In Germany the marinating would be done 
  in a cool place, like an unheated pantry or root cellar. The acidic 
  marinade protects the meat from spoilage. This is not so practical 
  here in Sunny Southern California, so it'll have to spend a lot of the 
  time in the refrigerator, with more time allowed (maybe an extra day). 
  Instead of keeping it in a covered bowl you can bag it with 
  the marinade in a strong polyethylene bag. Seal the bag and turn 
  every 8 hours.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>De-fat:</h3> &nbsp; Use your gravy separator. It'll take several 
  batches so pour off only 2/3 of what's in the separator before 
  refilling to keep fat out of the pour spout.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes use sour cream instead of 
  tomato paste, mostly in Bavaria.</li>
