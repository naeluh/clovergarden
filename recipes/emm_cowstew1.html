<p>This recipe makes a great party stew. When nearly ready to serve, 
bring it up to temperature, stir in the bell peppers, simmer a few 
minutes until they're crisp tender and pour it all into your slow 
cooker set to "keep warm".</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of all excess fat and cut into 1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise, peel and slice about 1/4 inch 
  thick. Chop coarse.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix into <b>Onions</b> along with 
  <b>Caraway Seeds</b> and <b>Marjoram</b>.</li>
<li>Core <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> and cut into 1 inch squares.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs)
<ol start="5">
<li>Heat 4 T <b>Oil</b> over high heat in a heavy iron skillet. Fry 
  <b>Beef</b> in 3 batches, stirring frequently until.lightly browned. 
  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
<li>Clean the skillet and heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> 
  and fry  stirring over moderate heat until you have a light golden 
  color and good flavor.</li>
<li>Mix <b>Beef</b> and <b>Onions</b> in a coverable pot. Stir in 
  <b>Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b> until evenly mixed. Stir in 
  <b>Tomatoes</b>  (including all juice) and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a 
  boil, cover and simmer gently for about 2 hours. <b>Caution:</b> 
  because of the flour you need to stir up the bottom often and keep it 
  at a very low simmer or you'll get a burned crust on the bottom.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Bell Peppers</b> and simmer another 15 minutes or until 
  crisp tender, regulating liquid by adding boiling water or simmering 
  uncovered as needed.</li>
<li>Serve with plenty of crusty bread and/or boiled potatoes.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck Roast is a good choice here. Local markets 
  have it reliably and often at a good price. Top Round roast is a little 
  too lean, but it'll work well enough. You don't want really tender cuts 
  because they lack flavor.</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Canned tomatoes are used because 
  the fresh ones available in markets are, even at their best, of inferior 
  flavor, and pretty bad in winter. If you have been careful about heat 
  and the oil used to fry the meat does not have a burned taste you can 
  fry the onions in it, but this will produce a very dark stew.</li>
