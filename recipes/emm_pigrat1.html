<p>This is a complex recipe, but dividing it up into separate chunks 
makes it quite doable. It can even be spread over 2 or 3 days, and 
the final cooking is short.</p>
<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
<ol>
<li>Make <b>BROWN GRAVY</b> if you don't have it on hand. It can be 
  made in various ways, see <a href="emm_pigrat1.html#02"><b>Brown Gravy</b></a>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Rat Tails</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/4 hrs - 45 min work)
<ol>
<li>Trim the large central muscle from a Pork Loin Roast and put it in 
  the freezer compartment until stiffened, so it can be sliced 
  precisely - (2-1/2 hrs or so). You want to get it too hard to slice 
  on the outside, then give it a little time on the cutting board until 
  it is sliceable, otherwise the core will still be too soft.</li>
<li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/4 inch thick, with the grain. Again, with 
  the grain, cut the slices into "Rat Tails", narrow strips tapering to 
  a point. They should be 5 to 6 inches long. You can wrap them in 
  plastic and hold overnight in the fridge, or, if you need more time, 
  you can freeze them.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="3">
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise and cut fairly thin 
  crosswise.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
  water and peel. Chop to about 1/4 inch.</li>
<li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
  off the skins under running water. Cut into 1/4 inch wide strips.</li>
<li>Slice <b>OLIVES</b> crosswise about 1/4 inch thick. Stem 
  <b>MUSHROOMS</b> and cut in half if large, then cut at right angles 
  about 1/4 inch thick. Slice <b>BABY CORNS</b> crosswise to about 1/2 
  inch lengths.</li>
<li>Mix all <b>M&eacute;lange</b> items.</li>
<li>Mix all <b>Seasonings items</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Rat Tails:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 to 45 minutes - 
Read <a href="emm_pigrat1.html#08"><b>Frying Rat Tails</b></a>)
  <ol start="9">
<li>In a skillet, Heat 1/4 cup <b>Butter</b> or <b>Lard</b> and fry 
  <b>Rat Tails</b>, stirring gently over moderate heat until lightly 
  browned. Flamb&eacute; with the <b>Calvados</b> and set aside. </li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol start=10>
<li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat 1/4 cup <b>Butter</b> and fry 
  the <b>Onions</b> until translucent.</li>
<li>Add <b>White Wine</b> and <b>Red Wine</b>. Simmer down to about 
  1/3 the depth.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>M&eacute;lange mix</b>. Cover and set to a simmer for 
  about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Slowly stir in the <b>Brown Gravy</b>, then the <b>Seasonings mix</b>
  stirring until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Heavy Cream</b> and <b>Port</b>. Don't bring quite 
  to a boil.</li>
<li>Gently stir in the <b>Rat Tails</b> until thoroughly heated. Keep 
  warm for about 15 minutes to let flavors blend.</li>
<li>Serve with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Loin:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is from the big central muscle 
  of a Pork Loin Roast, which will be sufficiently uniform to cut with 
  the grain into the desired shapes. A 3-1/2 pound roast should be 
  sufficient. See also <a href="emm_pigrat1.html#09"><b>Roast</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Brown Gravy</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Brown Gravy is made from 
  "drippings" from a beef roast - but we aren't doing beef roasts much 
  these days, so alternatives have been created. Our recipe 
  <a href="gjm_brngvy1.html"><b>Brown Gravy</b></a> is such a recipe, 
  and quick to make.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Spanish pimiento stuffed 
  Olives.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular white "button" mushrooms are called 
  for. Criminis will also be fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Butter / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe specified Butter for 
  frying the Rat Tails, and that's what I used, but Lard would be 
  quicker (higher temperature) and perhaps more traditional. Lard has a 
  better health profile than butter, so don't fear it. Offcuts from the 
  <a href="emm_pigrat1.html#09"><b>Roast</b></a> will provide the lard. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Calvados:</h3> &nbsp; This is an Apple or Pear brandy made in the 
  Calvados region of France. It can be hard to find, so if you don't 
  have it, use some other brandy. Stand back when you light it off.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Mustard:</h3> &nbsp; the pattern recipe calls for "mild German 
  mustard". My German mustard was not mild, so I used Dijon.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Frying Rat Tails:</h3> This can take from 25 minutes to 45 minutes 
  depending on the size of you skillet (how many Rat Tails you can 
  stretch out in it at once), how fussy you are about your Rat Tails 
  being straight, and if you fry in Butter or Lard. I did the frying in 
  Butter, in a small 10 inch skillet, in 5 batches in 45 minutes, being 
  quite fussy about straightness. They all go back into the pan at once, 
  with the heat turned high, for the Flamb&eacute;. Don't overdo the 
  browning or they will be rather stiff. This can be another break point.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Roast:</h3> &nbsp; The big central muscle of a Pork Loin Roast 
  is surrounded by a lot of fat and narrow pieces of meat. Once you 
  have trimmed away all that stuff and placed the central muscle in the 
  freeze to stiffen, deal with the offcuts. Offcuts that are clear fat 
  go into a fry pan with a little water to be rendered into useful Lard 
  and Cracklings (see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html">
  <b>Lard</b></a> page). Significant pieces of meat can be recovered, 
  sufficient for soup or stir fry. Tiny scraps and scraps that are mixed 
  meat and fat all go into a pot to be simmered into soup stock. There 
  should be no waste.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; From its diverse ingredients and methods, 
  this recipe clearly belongs to the "New German Cuisine", initiated by 
  young chefs who were scattered around in the post war period, learning 
  other cuisines. The diced White Onion was just garnish for the photo, 
  but got tossed in with the Rat Tails when they were rewarmed for my 
  supper. Now, I wouldn't serve this dish without them! I don't claim 
  this exact recipe is served by any specific restaurant, and having 
  seen no photos, I can't even say if it looks the same as in Hamelin.</li>
