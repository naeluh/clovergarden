This is a fairly light stew or soup (depending on how much liquid 
you add), but flavorful, substantial and very satisfying.  It is easy 
to make and can be made ahead.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (20)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and chop fine. Hold in cold water until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CARROTS</b>, <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and <b>LEEK</b> fine. Mix 
    all with <b>Marjoram</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BACON</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 
    small pieces.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BARLEY</b> and drain well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot of at least 5 quarts, melt <b>Butter</b> and 
    fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Barley</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat until 
    lightly toasted, 4 to 5 minutes depending on how wet the barley is. 
    There should be barely any browning and no blackening of the onions.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in along with the <b>Vegetable 
    mix</b>, <b>Sausages</b> (whole) and <b>Bacon</b>. Stir in <b>Stock</b> 
    and simmer until Barley is tender. Stir frequently, making sure 
    the barley doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. This may take as 
    little as 45 minutes for heavily pearled barley, but it takes 1-1/4 
    hours for the lightly pearled barley I use.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Nutmeg</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Pull out <b>Sausages</b> and cut them into appropriate size pieces. 
    Depending on size you may have to cut them lengthwise in half or 
    quarters. Then cut crosswise about 1/4 inch thick. Return them to 
    the soup.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Parsley</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley</b> (see also 
    <a href="eom_barsg1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). For buffet service just stir the Parsley 
    in just before setting out.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Russets work fine here as 
  they are basically a thickener and should dissolve in the soup. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sausage:</h3> &nbsp; A fairly mild sausage such 
  as Bratwurst works well here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausage</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; I use a relatively lightly 
  pearled barley (it still has a shade of color) as it maintains a better 
  texture and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot, a real problem 
  with heavily pearled barley.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken stock is most used, 
  but pork stock will also work fine. The pattern recipe suggests 
  Vegetable stock as an alternate, but what's the point when you have 
  sausages and bacon in the mix?</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe served 
  the broth in a bowl, and the sausages and parsley as garnishes. This 
  is nice for table service, but impractical for buffet service, just 
  mix the sausages back in. Stir in the parsley just before pouring it 
  into a slow cooker set to "keep warm". The pattern recipe also put 
  the bacon in as one piece, and discarded it before serving. I don't 
  see the point in this.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; Barley will keep absorbing 
  water for quite some time. When doing ahead, cook until barley is just 
  tender enough, cool, and refrigerate until needed. When used, bring it 
  back to a simmer, adding water or stock as needed, and stirring often 
  to make sure the barley doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Make 
  sure it is liquid enough and pour it into a slow cooker set to 
  "keep warm" for service.</li>
