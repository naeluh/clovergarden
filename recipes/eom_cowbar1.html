This is a substantial and meaty soup. The recipe is a bit of a production 
- but it makes plenty, and can be started days before the party. Final 
assembly takes only 20 minutes before servng.

  <b><u>Beef &amp; Broth</u> &nbsp; (1 to 3 Days Before)</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    (6-1/2 hrs, 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into large chunks, leaving fat on. In an 8 quart 
    pot, place <b>Beef</b> and <b>Beef Bones</b> with water to cover. 
    Bring to a rolling boil for 3 minutes or so, then pour it all out 
    into the sink. Clean the pot and rinse all the scum off the Beef and 
    Bones. Cool the beef and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Bones</b> back into the pot with plenty of <b>Water</b> 
    to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer about 4 hours.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Beef</b> to the pot, adding <b>Water</b> as needed. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer until Beef is tender, 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours 
    depending on cut and size of pieces.</li>
  <li>Cool the <b>Beef</b> and strip off excess fat. You should 
    have about 2 pounds. Refrigerate. It should be very cold before 
    dicing.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Broth</b>, discarding the bones. Defat using your 
    gravy separator. Boil it down a bit if too much - you need 8 cups. 
    Put in jars, cool well and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Soup Day Prep</u> &nbsp; (or afternoon before)</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    (55 min, 45 min work)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Rinse <b>BARLEY</b> and place in a pot with 3 c of the 
    <b>Beef Broth</b> and 1/2 cup <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer slowly until barley is tender, 45 min to 1 hr.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>CELERY</b> about 3/8 inch. Peel 
    <b>POTATOES</b> and dice about 5/8 inch. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in half and slice about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Dice <b> BEEF</b> about 5/8 inch or smaller - or as desired.</li>
  <li>Tip and tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> (if using). Cut into about 3/4 inch 
    lengths. Par boil in boiling salted <b>Water</b> until just tender. 
    Refresh under cold running water and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, melt <b>Lard</b>. Stir in <b>Onion</b> and fry 
    stirring until translucent. Stir in <b>Carrot mix</b> and simmer over 
    low heat, stirring now and then, until Potatoes are tender. Stir in 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> simmer another 4 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>At this point you can refrigerate everything for the next day if 
    you wish (The Beef and Broth should already be in the fridge).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Assemble &amp; Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="14">
  <li>Chop <b>Parsley</b> or <b>Dill</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>In a 5 quart pot, bring 5 c <b>Beef Broth</b> to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Beef</b>, <b>Vegetable mix</b>, <b>Barley</b>, <b>Thyme</b>, 
    <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a simmer for 5 minutes 
    or so. Adjust with boiling water if too thick (it probably will be).
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Green Beans</b> (if used).</li>
  <li>In a bowl, mix <b>Sour Cream</b> with some of the broth, then stir 
    into the soup.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Parsley</b> or <b>Dill</b>. For buffet 
    service, as soon as it's done, I pour it into a slow cooker set to 
    "keep warm".</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fairly lean boneless beef. Shoulder 
  is good, or Round. You don't need a tender cut for this.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well here. Reds could be 
  used but tend to disintegrate more. "Yukon Gold" type potatoes should 
  be avoided as they turn to mush when cooked a little long. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the primary frying medium used by Czechs. 
  The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid 
  to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they 
  insisted we use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, 
  and is now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't want to use it, butter will work, or even oil.</li>
