This delicious and easy to make recipe is in between a soup and a stew. 
To make a soup use a little more water and cut the pieces a little smaller. 
For stew use a little less water.

<p>My method differs substantially from the pattern recipe, but I call 
precedence - there is no way in Hades the given recipe would produce the 
soup shown in the photo that accompanies it. My method gets closer.</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs, 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/2 inch thick and and cut into chunks of 
    the desired size, smaller for soup, larger for stew. Split the 
    <b>Beef Bones</b> if needed.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b> in your soup pot and bring it to 
    a boil over high heat. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and <b>Bones</b>. Bring back 
    to a boil and as it comes to a boil skim the surface until no more crud 
    rises.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly and stick <b>ONION</b> with <b>Cloves</b> 
    (theoretically to make the cloves easier to retrieve, but it doesn't 
    actually work). Add both to the pot along with <b>Bay Leaf</b> and set 
    to a slow simmer. Simmer until Beef is tender, about 2 hours for 
    shoulder, up to 2-1/2 for round.</li>
  <li>Strain out the solids. Discard Onion, Bay Leaf and cloves (if you can 
    find them). De-fat the stock as needed (if your bones had much marrow 
    you need to, it's mostly fat). Use your gravy separator for this.</li>
  <li>While beef is cooking: core <b>CABBAGE</b> and cut lengthwise into 
    wedges about 1-1/2 inches wide. Slice crosswise about 1/2 inches wide.
    </li>
  <li>Trim outer leaves of <b>LEEK</b> leaving only white and yellow. Split 
    lengthwise, rinse out mud and cut into 1 inch lengths. Add to Cabbage.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into convenient size chunks. 
    Peel <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and cut into convenient size chunks, cutting 
    away any woody parts. Add both to Cabbage.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into chunks as desired - about 3/4 inch 
    for soup, 1 inch or so for stew. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Stock</b> to the pot. Stir in <b>Cabbage mix</b> and 
    drained <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer slowly until 
    Potatoes are done, about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Beef</b> to the pot and bring up hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fairly lean beef, 
  boneless and trimmed of all excess fat. Shoulder is good for this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Celery Root</h3> &nbsp; Select a modest size celery root with 
  numerous stems. Those that are too large or have just one huge stem 
  tend to be woody. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well here. Reds could be 
  used but tend to disintegrate more. "Yukon Gold" type potatoes should 
  be avoided as they turn to mush when cooked a little long. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
