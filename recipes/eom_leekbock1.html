"This soup is seductive" - a party guest. Flavorful and substantial, this 
recipe does work well as a party dish, but see that the leeks are cooked

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim <b>LEEKS</b> so only the white and yellow remain (a little green 
  is OK). Quarter them lengthwise from just above the roots, spread leaves 
  and wash thoroughly. Slice crosswise into slices about 1/2 inch wide 
  (start at the leaf end and work toward the root).</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Keep submerged in 
  cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise, slice about 1/4 inch wide 
  crosswise and chop medium. Peel <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and cut into 1/4 
  inch dice. Cut <b>CARROTS</b> into 3/4 inch dice. Mix all.</li>
<li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="5">
<li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Bacon</b>, reducing heat as it frys, until 
  the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp. Remove bacon with a slotted 
  spoon, drain on paper towels and resist eating it (maybe start with a 
  little extra for "test samples").</li>
<li>Pour out <b>Oil</b> into a bowl. Measure 3 T back into the pan.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Onion mix</b> stirring over moderate flame until onions are 
  golden.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and put in a pot along with <b>Beef Stock</b> 
  and <b>Onions</b>. Arrange <b>Sausages</b> on top. Bring to a boil, 
  cover and turn down to a gentle simmer for about 30 minutes until 
  potatoes are tender.</li>
<li>Remove <b>Sausages</b> and slice about 3/16 inch thick. Return to the 
  pot.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Leeks</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a 
  boil and simmer another 10 to 15 minutes until leeks are just crisp 
  tender - especially for buffet, the leeks should be minimally cooked 
  before pouring into a slow cooker set to "keep warm".</li>   
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium.</li>
<li>When about ready to serve, taste for salt and stir in <b>Parsley</b> 
  and <b>Bacon</b>.</li>
<li>Serve with plenty of crusty <b>Bread</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I favor White Rose potatoes for this. They 
  will provide some thickening from their corners and edges but will not 
  disintegrate. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes, they will disintegrate 
  into mush cooked just a bit long. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; Bockwurst or Knackwurst are the proper 
  sausages for this recipe. Knackwurst will split apart as shown in the 
  photo, Bockwurst will stay more intact. The amount is highly variable 
  from none to a little more than the amount given.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't find this use about 3 ounces 
  of celery ribs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> page.</li>
