This excellent soup is substantial, but not heavy, suitable for all 
seasons. The ingredient list is long, but it's not at all difficult to 
make.

<p>The Swiss are of two minds about tripe - half the people know what it 
is and want nothing to do with it, the other half know what it is and 
love it.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs - 1-1/2 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>TRIPE</b> and cut off any fat that clings to it. Place in a 
    pot with 1/4 t <b>Citric Acid</b>, 1/4 t <b>Salt</b> and cold water to 
    cover for about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse. Repeat one more time.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the tripe with just enough cold water to 
    cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until tripe is tender but still 
    "al dente", about 1-1/4 hour or more depending on type of tripe.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Trim <b>LEEKS</b> to white and light green 
    only. Split and wash out all remaining mud, then slice thin.
    Trim <b>CELERY ROOT</b> to remove all the grungy stuff. Cut into about 
    1/2 inch cubes. Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, 
    quench in cold water, peel and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Slice 
    <b>CARROTS</b> about 1/4 inch thick. Tip and tail <b>BEANS</b> and 
    cut into 1 inch lengths. Slice cabbage about 1/2 inch wide by 1-1/2 
    inches long. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Dice bacon about 1/4 inch. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> stirring until the first trace of color. Stir in 
    <b>Garlic</b> and continue to fry stirring until garlic starts to 
    color (and stick to the pan). If you're doing a double recipe do this 
    step in a saut&eacute; pan, loosen with white wine and pour into the 
    soup pot.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>White Wine</b>, <b>Stock</b> and 5 c <b>Water</b> into the 
    Soup Pot. Bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vegetable mix</b> and bring back to a boil. Turn down 
    the heat and simmer about 3/4 hour.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Tripe</b> into strips about 3/8 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches 
    long and add to the Soup.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Seasoning items</b> as needed and stir into the soup. Simmer 
    for another 15 minutes.</li> 
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and dice into about 
    1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Adjust seasoning to taste and serve hot, garnished with grated 
    <b>Cheese</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; honeycomb tripe is preferred but blanket tripe 
  will do fine. The weight given and cooking time is for tripe as sold 
  in U.S. markets (cleaned, par-boiled and bleached). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Tripe Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Citric Acid:</h3> &nbsp; 1/2 t is equivalent to the juice of 1 
  lemon.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; Use celery root if you can, it better 
  matches the texture of the soup. Select ones with a bunch of stems, 
  those with a single thick stem will be fibrous. If you just don't 
  have celery root, use 2 ounces celery stems trimmed and sliced about 
  1/4 inch thick. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer White Rose for recipes of this sort. 
  Don't use Yukon Gold type, which disintegrate into mush if overcooked 
  a few minutes.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Swiss Sprinz, but If you don't 
  have that Parmesan will work well.</li>
