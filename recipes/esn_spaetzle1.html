This is the pasta of Germany. It is thought to have originated in Swabia 
in Southern Germany, but is now popular throughout the country.
It is commonly used as a side dish with meats, plain or with plenty 
of sauce or gravy.

<p>Sp&auml;etzle may also be baked in a casserole with cheese and 
onion.	In the German corner of Italy it is made with spinach added to 
the batter. In Hungary it is called <i>nokedli</i> and may be used in 
soup.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil so it will be ready when 
    the batter is ready.  Place a big bowl of cold water conveniently 
    nearby.</li>
  <li>Combine <b>Flour</b>, <b>Nutmeg</b> and <b>Salt</b> in a bowl 
    and make a well in the center.</li>
  <li>Whisk together <b>Milk</b> and <b>Egg</b>. Pour them into the 
    well.</li>
  <li>Beat the ingredients into a smooth paste with a wooden spoon until 
    the batter is smooth and elastic. OK, I confess, I use my big 
    Kitchen Aid mixer with the paddle to do this work. Careful, don't 
    overbeat or the dough will become tough, but it should be just soft 
    enough to push through the holes of the sp&auml;etzel maker - no 
    softer.</li>
  <li>Press the batter through a Sp&auml;etzle Maker directly into the 
    boiling water (see <a href="esn_spaetzle1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Let cook for 4 to  
    8 minutes, depending on thickness, then scoop them out into the 
    bowl of cold water. They can be kept there for up to an hour. &nbsp; 
    <u>Note</u>: &nbsp; Do this right away - I've noticed a definite 
    tendency to stick together in lumps coming out of the ricer if the 
    batter sits.</li> 
  <li>In a heavy skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Butter</b> and fry 
    the <b>Sp&auml;etzle</b> gently until warm, or until lightly browned, 
    as you prefer.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; In Central Europe, rather soft flour is used. 
  Our All Purpose flour is a lot tougher, so this recipe uses more milk 
  than called for in Germany. Gold Medal brand was used, purchased in 
  California - other brands may vary a little.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sp&auml;etzle Maker:</h3> &nbsp; I use a strong potato ricer, 
  similar to a <i>Sp&auml;tzlepresse</i>. In Germany, many chefs coat a 
  wooden paddle with batter and push thin threads off into the pot. Some 
  people use a wooden spoon to push batter through a large holed 
  colander. The most common "official" sp&auml;etzel maker 
  (<i>Sp&auml;tzlehobel</i>) looks like a single sided grater. It has a 
  box for the dough which is slid back and forth over the grater while 
  held across the pot of boiling water. This device will make the 
  <i>Kn&ouml;pfle</i> (small buttons) form of sp&auml;etzle rather than 
  the long stringy form.
