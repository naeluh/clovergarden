Potato dumplings are very popular in the Czech Republic, as a side dish 
with sauces, in soups and stews, or just sliced and dressed with fried 
onion and hot lard or butter.

<p>This dough recipe, uncooked, also serves as the basis of some other 
dishes, like the delicious Cones shown in the photo.	</p>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs - 5 min work)
<ol>
  <li>Boil <b>POTATOES</b> in their skins until tender all the way 
    through. Cool and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Strip skins from <b>Potatoes</b> and grate them.</li>
  <li>Get a pot of water boiling for immediate cooking of the dumplings.
    </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Potatoes</b> with <b>Salt</b>, <b>Semolina</b> and 
    <b>Flour</b> until evenly blended.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Potatoes</b> into a mound with a well in the center. 
    Pour in <b>Eggs</b> (without shells) and Vinegar. Work into a stiff 
    dough. Don't let it sit too long or it may become sticky and watery. 
    If already sticky, work in a little more flour.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Dough</b> into cylinders about 2 inches in diameter and 4 
    or 5 inches long. Get them into the boiling water, making sure they 
    don't stick to the bottom of the pot, keep them at a medium boil 
    until cooked through, about 25 minutes. This will be a little while 
    yet after they float to the surface. Cut one in half to verify 
    doneness.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Dumplings</b> and serve dressed as desired. For soups 
    or stews you can cut the slices in quarters, or even smaller.</li> 
  </ol>
<p><b>-- <u>Cones</u> --</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<br>These are finished "Polish Style" in butter browned bread crumbs, 
and they are delicious.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Make one recipe <b>Dumpling Dough</b> (uncooked).</li>
  <li>Form <b>Dough</b> into cones about 1 inch diameter and 2 inches 
    long. As soon as all are formed, get them into boiling water for 
    about 5 minutes or until done through. Drain. </li>
  <li>Melt <b>Lard</b> or <b>Butter</b>. Fry <b>Bread Crumbs</b> until 
    lightly browned. Stir in cones until coated with Bread Crumbs and 
    heated through. I do this in a large electric skillet, which gives 
    me the best temperature control.</li>
  <li>Serve warm. For buffet, I serve these in a smaller electric skillet 
    set to "warm".</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Russets or similar baking 
  potatoes are right for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is perhaps more traditional, and has a 
  slightly better health profile than butter, but the flavor of butter 
  can't be beat here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Recipe:</h3> &nbsp; The dumpling recipe is from a cookbook 
  published in 1986 in Czechoslovakia, before the fall of Communism 
  and separation into Czech Republic and Slovakia (czc159). 
  An older recipe (1965) adapted from a popular Czech cookbook used 3-1/4 
  cups Instantized flour (flour processed for use as a thickener) with 
  no semolina or vinegar, but I don't know how "adapted" it was (cc97).
