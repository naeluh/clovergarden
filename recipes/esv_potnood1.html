The Germans call these "nudeln" (noodles). I call them "potato slugs" 
(perhaps too graphic?). This recipe makes 50 to 60 slugs . . err. . 
noodles.

These are typical of the southwest German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, 
and are also very popular in S&uuml;dtirol in the Alpine region of 
northeastern Italy. They are often served with sauerkraut. See

  <li>Boil <b>POTATOES</b> in their skins until tender all the way 
    through. Cool and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)

  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.
  <li>Strip skins from <b>Potatoes</b> and grate them.</li>
  <li>Get a pot of water boiling for immediate cooking of the slugs.
    </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Potatoes</b> with <b>Nutmeg</b>, <b>Parsley</b> 
    <b>Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b> until evenly blended.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Potatoes</b> into a mound with a well in the center. 
    Pour in <b>Egg Yolks</b>. Work into a stiff  dough. If sticky, 
    work in more flour. Don't let it sit too long or it may become 
    watery and sticky.</li>
  <li>Roll small balls of <b>Dough</b> into spindle shapes, about 2-1/2 
    inches long and 3/4 inch diameter at the center, tapering to a blunt 
    point at both ends. As soon as all are formed, get them into boiling 
    water, in batches so they aren't over-crowded. When they all float 
    to the surface, give them 2 more minutes. Scoop them out and 
    Drain.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Lard</b> or <b>Butter</b>. Fry <b>Bread Crumbs</b> until 
    lightly browned. Stir in slugs and fry over moderate heat, tumbling 
    often, until coated with Bread Crumbs and heated through. The outer 
    surface will become just a little stiff. I do this in a large 
    electric skillet, which gives me the best temperature control.</li>
  <li>Serve warm. For buffet, I serve these in an electric skillet 
    set to "warm", usually with Sauerkraut.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Russets or similar baking 
  potatoes are right for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is perhaps more traditional, and has a 
  slightly better health profile than butter, but the flavor of butter 
  can't be beat here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; These are often served as an appetizer with 
  stewed sauerkraut. See our recipe <a href="esv_skrautt1.html">
  <b>Sauerkraut with Apples &amp; Wine</b></a>, used both in Germany 
  and S&uuml;dtirol. They may also be served with sour cream, or as a 
  side for meat dishes. If serving at a buffet, make plenty, they will 
  be popular.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; Most of the work can be done 
  even a few days ahead. Do all steps through boiling and draining. When 
  cool enough to handle, tumble with a dash of oil, just enough to 
  keep them from sticking. Bag them in plastic and refrigerate for as 
  long as three days.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Recipe:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is based mainly on one from 
  S&uuml;dtirol that finishes them "Polish style": boiling, then frying 
  in butter and breadcrumbs. Many German recipes do not use the bread 
  crumbs, and often do not do the boil either, but let them sit 15 
  minutes and then fry them in lard until lightly browned. Considering 
  the stunning success of my <a href="esv_potdump1.html"><b>Czech 
  Potato Cones</b></a>, a similar recipe finished "Polish Style", I 
  stayed with that method. In German restaurants, to save effort, the 
  dough is often rolled out about 1/2 inch thick and the noodles are 
  cut from it.</li>
