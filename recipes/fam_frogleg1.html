Fresh, tasty and easy to make. There are many recipes under this name, but 
this one uses ingredients and simple methods typical of Provence. I think 
some recipes mistake "Proven&ccedil;ale" for "country style".

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Thaw <b>FROG LEGS</b>, separate into individual legs and cut off 
    bony toes if present. Rinse in several changes of water.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix 
    both with Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Note that there is no acceptable substitute for Olive Oil, which 
    should be your best Extra Virgin.</li>

  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)

  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, place <b>Frog Legs</b> and pour over them 
    <b>Vermouth</b> or white wine. Bring to a boil, then take off heat.  
    Remove frog legs and set them aside.</li>
  <li>Add to the pan <b>All Items</b> <u>except</u> the Frog Legs. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer uncovered to reduce by about half.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Frog Legs</b> to the pan and simmer for around 20 min for 
    4/6 size, less for smaller (see <a href="fam_frogleg1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Serve with rice or crusty bread, a salad and a light Burgundy wine.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Frog Legs</h3> &nbsp; If you don't live in one of the regions were 
  frog legs are traditional, look in Asian markets in the frozen food 
  cases. For details see our <a href="../ingred/rp_frogz.html">
  <b>Frogs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vermouth</h3> &nbsp; Other white wines can be used if you don't 
  have vermouth on hand.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cooking Time:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "5 minutes" 
  or until they turn pearly white. For the 4/6 frog legs we have around 
  here, at 8 minutes they started falling apart but were still a bit 
  rubbery. At around 20 minutes they were more tender and hadn't fallen 
  apart much more, so I say go with a longer cooking time unless your 
  frog legs are much smaller and proven tender.</li>
