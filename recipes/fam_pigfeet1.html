This French recipe presents Pig Feet without the bones and with a crispy 
crust over the gelatinous center. Deboning is rather messy, so I suggest 
doing this part well ahead.

<p><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; these are very filling, which has caused me to 
develop a non-traditional serving style (see <a href="fam_pigfeet1.html#02">
<b>Serving</b></a>).</p>

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-1/2 hrs / alt 6 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> well. If not already done, split in half 
    lengthwise (see <a href="fam_pigfeet1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Put in a pot with 
    water to cover well and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Pour them out 
    in the sink and rinse. Clean the pot and return the pig feet to it. 
    Pour in enough cold water to cover the pig feet well.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEKS</b> to white and light green parts and cut into chunks. 
    Cut <b>CARROTS</b> into 1 inch lengths. Dice <b>Turnip</b> about 3/4 
    inch. Mix.</li>
  <li>Put everything <u>except</u> Finish items in the pot with the pig 
    feet. Add cold water to cover if needed and bring back to a boil. Set 
    to simmer slowly until the pig feet have 3 hours total cooking time.
    </li>
  <li>Pull <b>Pig Feet</b> from the pot, drain and cool enough to handle 
    but not cold. Remove all the bones working from the cut side.</li>
  <li>Melt 1-1/2 oz <b>Butter</b>. In a bowl, tumble <b>Pig Feet</b> with 
    the Butter until coated. Then roll them in <b>Bread crumbs</b> to 
    coat on all sides.</li>
  <li>Grill or Broil <b>Pig Feet</b> until golden brown on all sides.</li>
  <li>Melt 2 oz <b>Butter</b>. Arrange hot <b>Pig Feet</b> on a heated 
    platter and drizzle with hot butter. Serve hot with <b>Mustard</b>.
    <p></p></li>
    </ol>
  <ol start="7">
  <li><b><u>Alternate</u>:</b> &nbsp; Take the pig feet from the broiler 
    or grill and let cool, then refrigerate until very firm so they 
    slice nicely.</li>
  <li>Slice to the thickness you desire (1/2 inch or thicker). Place in a 
    pan or on foil in a 400&deg;F/200&deg;C oven until nicely hot. 
    Arrange on a heated platter and serve with <b>Mustard</b>.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; These weigh about 1 pound each and should be 
  sawed in half lengthwise by your butcher - or you can do it yourself 
  driving a razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife through with a soft faced 
  mallet. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html">
  <b>Pig Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally these are taken from the grill 
  directly to a heated platter and served whole (see 
  <a href="fam_pigfeet1x.html#trad"><b>Photos</b></a>). The problem is, a whole 
  piece is so filling it's likely to ruin you appetite for much else. Pig 
  feet don't have much fat but they're almost pure protein, and the 
  buttered   bread crumbs don't make them any lighter. This has caused 
  me to develop an alternate serving style.</li>
