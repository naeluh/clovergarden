This is your basic French savory omelet. Very simple, extremely 
versitile, but it takes a properly seasoned <a href="fbd_omelet1.html#04"><b>Pan</b></a> 
and a little practice to 
get it right.

<p>The chef set favors a double fold these days, making a long narrow 
omelet. This has the advantages of leaving more room on the plate for 
fancy and it holds less filling, but those are not generally my 
objectives so I use the single fold.</p>

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 minutes for 4, + making filling)
<ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>FILLING</b> for as many omelets as you will be making 
    and keep it warm. The photo example is a bit over-stuffed with fried 
    blood sausage.</li>
  <li>Warm the <b>Plates</b> your omelets will be served on.</li>
  <li>Set up your <b>Eggs</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b> ready to be 
    whipped, but don't whip until just ready to use. If you're making 4 
    omelets set them up in individual cups.</li>
  <li>When ready to make an omelet, whip up a set of <b>Egg Mix</b>, 
    enough to blend the yolks and whites but not frothy.</li>
  <li>Over a moderately hot flame, heat the omelet pan. Test hotness with 
    a small piece of butter which should foam well but not brown. Wipe out 
    the test with a paper towel.</li>
  <li>Put in the <b>Butter</b>, about 1 teaspoon depending on your pan. 
    and swirl it about, then pour in the <b>Egg Mix</b> with a circular 
    motion.</li>
  <li>Immediately start working the egg from the sides of the pan to the 
    middle as long as there's liquid egg enough to refil the edge . Once 
    it is setting well work just the top and get it all about level.</li>
  <li>When the top is nearly ready, spoon your <b>Filling</b> onto 
    the left half of the omelet (looking from the handle side and 
    presuming you're right handed).</li>
  <li>When it's ready, make sure the omelet is free from the pan and 
    slide it off onto the plate by tilting the pan. When it's half on the 
    plate, tilt the pan up to fold the empty half over the filling. This 
    is the critical point - not done enough you'll have liquid egg 
    running on the plate, too well done and you have a ruined omelet, 
    see (<a href="fbd_omelet1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Grind a little pepper over and serve immediately. Diners should 
    start on their omelet as soon as placed, not waiting for others to 
    be served.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes insist on cream but I rarely have 
  cream open and water was good enough for Dione Lucas.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Whipping:</h3> &nbsp; Some persons of refined sensibility strain 
  the whipped mixture to remove the white strings that holds the yolk in 
  place but I'm a barbarian so I don't bother. Haven't ever seen the 
  silly things in an omelet anyway.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Doneness:</h3> &nbsp; Many years ago a couple asked me 
  to teach them how to make omelets in their own kitchen because they 
  considered mine so much better.  At the critical point I filled the 
  omelet and started to slide it onto the plate. The lady protested, 
  "No, we like our eggs more done than that!". I replied, "No you don't, 
  or you wouldn't be having me showing you how to make omelets". 
  Overcooking was their entire problem.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pan:</h3> &nbsp; Anyone serious about omelets has an omelet pan 
  that is used for nothing else, and woe betide anyone who touches it.
  I prefer a long handled plain steel pan 9-1/4 inches diameter with 
  shallowly sloping sides (7 inch flat). Omelet &uuml;ber expert Dione 
  Lucas prefered an aluminum pan with shallowly curved sides. In any 
  case, the pan is never washed. If egg sticks, which it never should, 
  it is removed by scrubbing with a paper towel and coarse salt.</li>
