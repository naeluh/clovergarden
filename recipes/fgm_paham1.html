<p>In a dish so simple, quality of ingredients and care with texture are 
critical.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cook <b>PASTA</b> the usual way in plenty of rapidly boiling salted 
    water until just done - do not overcook! Drain well and stir in just a 
    few drops of olive oil to keep it from sticking together. Chill well.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HAM</b> into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Hard cook <b>EGGS</b> in salted water. Peel and chill them. Slice them 
    fairly thin and cut slices into halves or quarters (depending on 
    diameter).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PICKLES</b> thin and chop slices fairly small.</li> 
  <li>Mix together <b>all Dressing Items</b> until smooth.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>all Items</b> except egg slices together with the 
    <b>Dressing</b>. When thoroughly and uniformly mixed, mix in 
    <b>Egg Slices</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve well chilled.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a very small tubular 
  form. The photo specimen was made with miniature elbow macaroni, and 
  I was quite happy with the result.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Gherkins", 
  which means rather small cucumber pickles (real gherkins are almost 
  impossible to find even in India). The important thing is that they 
  taste good. I used very small and fairly mild kosher dills, and 
  they worked fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's "Real Mayonnaise" (east of the Mississippi) 
  or Best Foods Real (west of the Mississippi), as nearly all food 
  writers agree.</li>
