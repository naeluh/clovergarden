This variation of the standard cucumber salad, replacing oil with cream, 
is very popular in france. See also <a href="fgv_cukcream1.html">

<p>Salting and wringing out the Cucumbers is to prevent the salad from

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBERS</b> very thin, preferably on a mandolin or 
    some similar cutter.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice very thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>Cucumbers</b> and <b>Onions</b> with salt and let stand 
    in a non-reactive bowl for at least 45 minutes, tumbling a couple of 
    times. Rinse well, and squeeze out excess water (the cucumbers should 
    be quite limp at this stage). Place in a mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Garlic</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>Dill</b> fine. Mix into 
    the Cucumbers.</li>
  <li>Mix in <b>Cream</b>, then <b>Vinegar</b> and season with 
    <b>Pepper</b>. The Cucumbers should still be a little salty, so salt 
    probably won't be needed.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use small Persian 
  cucumbers, or similar cukes that don't have to be peeled or seeded. 
  If you have only the standard waxed green blimps, you'll have to peel 
  and seed them, cutting them lengthwise in half or quarters depending 
  on size. Weight would be after peeling and seeding.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dill:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but the pattern recipe allows 1/2 
  t dried dill weed.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very high fat 
  slightly soured cream. I buy Bellwether Farms brand from Trader Joe's. 
  The pattern recipe calls for 1 cup, but the tubs I buy are 7-1/2 oz, 
  so that's what I call for. If you can't get it use 1 c highest fat 
  sour cream you can find (Alta-Dena around here) and cut it with 2 T 
  Heavy Cream. That'll still be significantly more sour than with 
  Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che</li>
