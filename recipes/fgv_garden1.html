<p>Yes, an hour is quite long for making a salad - but you're getting 
more than 4 pounds of salad, enough for a whole bunch of hungry people.
</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hour)
  <ol>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into rather small florets. Trim so there's 
    very little stem. Soak in water with 1 T <b>Salt</b> for 30 minutes. 
    Drain.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> medium. Quarter <b>CUCUMBERS</b> and cut into 
    1/4 inch pieces (see <a href="fgv_garden1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Dice 
    <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> about 3/8 inch and mix in along with drained 
    <b>Cauliflower</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Herbs</b> and mix in along with <b>Paprika</b>.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Dressing:</b> First mix <b>Vinegar</b> with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>. When Salt is dissolved, mix with <b>Olive Oil</b>. 
    Put in a jar and shake vigorously, then tumble with the <b>Salad</b>. 
    Refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b>. Remove all stems and dry in your salad 
    spinner. Cut leaves into pieces between 3/4 and 1 inch on a side or 
    as desired.</li>
  <li>Cut Garnish <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> into narrow strips.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, tumble <b>Spinach</b> into the salad. 
    Garnish with strips of <b>Bell Pepper</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use small Persian 
  cucumbers, or similar cukes that don't have to be peeled  or seeded. 
  They should be no larger than 1-1/4 inch diameter. If you have only 
  the standard waxed green blimps, use a couple more ounces than given. 
  You'll have to peel and seed them, then cut into 6ths lengthwise before 
  slicing.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dressing:</h3> &nbsp; Half and half vinegar and oil is pretty bold, 
  more like California or Spain than France, where more than twice as 
  much oil as vinegar is the norm - but I'm not about to question the 
  Frenchness of Mapie, Countess of Toulouse Lautrec. On the other hand, 
  Toulouse is down in the Occitania region near Spain and 
  Proven&ccedil;e where such a ratio would be normal. Personally, I never 
  use more oil than vinegar, but then I'm not a French gourmet.</li>
<li id="#03">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; I use a flavorful Extra Virgin oil, though 
  the French tend to like a milder oil. Remember, quality counts.</li>
<li id="#04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Either red or white can be used, 
  though I prefer red. Again, quality counts. I use a flavorful Italian 
  wine vinegar.</li>
