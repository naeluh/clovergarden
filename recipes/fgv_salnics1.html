A justly famous and quite substantial salad that can also serve as a light 
but satisfying lunch - if so used, you can add a 6 ounce can of drained 
water packed Tuna along with the potatoes and eggs.

<p>Since the dressing is added at serving time, this salad can be made 
ahead.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the <b>Dressing</b>. It should have a couple hours to mature. I 
    just toss all the ingredients in a min-prep food processor and run it 
    until very well blended.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>POTATOES</b> in boiling water until just done (a sharp skewer 
    encounters no hard spot going through the center of the largest potato).
    Chill thoroughly, and with a very thin knife cut into dice between 1/2 
    and 3/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Hard boil <b>EGGS</b>. The yolks should be cooked quite firm. Chill 
    them thoroughly, shell and cut into quarters.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GREEN BEANS</b> diagonally into 1 inch lengths. Drop into 
    boiling water and cook until just barely tender. Refresh in cold water.
    </li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil and toss in the <b>TOMATOES</b> 
    for just 1 minute, chill in cold water and peel. Cut into 3/4 
    inch dice and drain.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONIONS</b> and slice into thin rings.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> into thin rings (if very small) or narrow 
    strips (easier to eat).</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> and cut in half crosswise.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHERVIL</b> coarse.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>When ready to serve, toss together <b>All Salad items</b> 
    (see <a href="fgv_salnics1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). Hold the <b>Potatoes</b> 
    until next to last and the <b>Eggs</b> until last so they don't 
    get mushed up.</li>
  <li>Line individual bowls with lettuce leaves, place salad on top and 
    drizzle with dressing. Serve.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Use Mediterranean brine or 
  salt cured olives, not those canned "California olives". The recipe calls 
  for small olives, so if all you have is very large ones, make two cuts 
  instead of one. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chervil</h3> &nbsp; This is the gourmet's favorite herb, because 
  it's almost impossible to find in North America, even in Los Angeles. 
  To fake it up use the inner (yellowish) stems and leaves of celery, 
  3/4 by volume, parsley leaf almost 1/4 by volume, and a few leaves of 
  Tarragon. I have successfully used Armenian canned Chervil in this 
  recipe. For details see our <a href="../ingred/py_chervz.html">
  <b>Chervil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Anchovies:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible use Italian or Spanish 
  Anchovy Fillets (they'll be packed in jars). Morocco produces nearly 
  all the canned anchovies in the world - and their anchovies are 
  generally of poor quality. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_anchoeuz.html"><b>European Anchovy</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Here I'm using a little more vinegar to oil 
  than is the custom in France, because I like my dressing a bit tart. 
  Adjust either way to your preference. Use your best white wine vinegar 
  for this salad.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This salad is often served as performance art. 
  A shallow bowl is lined with lettuce and the various vegetables are 
  arranged over it in an artful manner. The bowl is presented at the 
  table and dramatically tossed there. It is then parted out to bowls 
  and the dressing drizzled over it. When I serve it as buffet dish I 
  make two recipes of salad and three of dressing. I set the salad out 
  in a bowl and the dressing in a separate container with a 1 ounce 
  ladle.</li>
