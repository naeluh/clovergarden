In France, this important sauce is credited to Louis de B&eacute;chamel, 
maitre d'h&ocirc;tel to Louis XIV, but it had already long been used in 
Italy under the name <i>Balsamella</i>, now spelled <i>Besciamella</i>.

<p>There is disagreement as to how to keep it from getting lumps, see

on thickness. See <a href="fjd_bechamel1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for sauces made from

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Keep <b>Milk</b> well chilled.<li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> over moderate heat in a heavy bottomed saucepan. 
    Stir in <b>Flour</b> and cook stirring constantly for a couple of 
    minutes until the flour is a light blonde color (no browing at all) 
    and no longer smells raw. This is called a "blonde roux".</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and stir in the chilled <b>Milk</b> all at once. 
    Return to the heat and stir constantly until the sauce thickens 
    and becomes smooth, about 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b>, <b>White Pepper</b> and Nutmeg.</li>
  <li>If you need to hold the sauce, cover the surface with plastic 
    film, or otherwise protect it from air. It can be refrigerated 
    overnight - reheat very slowly with plenty of stirring.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes tell you to heat the milk to a 
  simmer, then stir it into the roux starting with fractions of a 
  teaspoon and adding slowly increasing amounts until it is all stirred 
  in. Mapie, Countess de Toulouse-Lautrec, says you will be much more 
  successful stirring chilled milk into the hot roux all at once. 
  Alma Lach concurrs. These are two of the formost experts in the French 
  cuisine, and it works for me, so I give that method here. If you do 
  get any lumps, strain them out.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thickness:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce can be made a little thicker by 
  using a bit more flour, but also add a little butter as the weight of 
  flour must not exceed the weight of butter. Alma Lach makes it a little
  thicker than given here, then thins it with some cream if it is to be 
  used plain.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; In Provence, France, Olive Oil may be used in 
  place of the butter.</li>
