This popular sauce is served with raw vegetables, steamed or boiled potatoes, 
or spread on toast before fish soup is ladled over. There are endless 
recipes for this sauce, but the ones here are typical, and work.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use 
  Red Fresnos, but Holland Red and others are fine. Fresno's usually 
  aren't that hot, but I've encountered some that were positively 
  homicidal. After tasting adjust hotness with a chili powder. I 
  usually use Indian Reshampatti, a medium hot powder I always have 
  on hand, but other powders like Cayenne will work fine - but not 
  California or New Mexico "Chili Powders" which have other ingredients.  
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mini-Prep:</h3> &nbsp; I use a Cuisinart Mini-Prep 
  Plus. It has two indented vent holes in the lid. I drilled one a bit 
  larger so I can drizzle olive oil through while it's running, making 
  emulsified sauces easy.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's Real (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods 
  Real (west of the Mississippi), as nearly all food writers agree.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Egg Yolk:</h3> &nbsp; Recipe #1 uses raw egg yolk. The danger in 
  this is controversial.  Here in "over regulated" California, infections 
  from home cooked food are paractically unknown and even institutional 
  events have been rare. On the other hand, If you live in one of those 
  "business friendly" Red States, you should be very cautious. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html#safe"><b>Egg Safety</b></a> 
  article. In any case, infants, very small children, the frail elderly 
  and those with compromised immune systems should avoid undercooked 
  egg.</li>
