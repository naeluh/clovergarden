Simmered chicken in a firm flavorful sauce, an excellent party dish 
because it's made a day ahead and served without reheating. It needs 
at least 6 hours in the fridge to firm up.

<p>This is French home style, much more practical than the highly 
decorative concoctions of pricey chefs. The photo specimen was a half 
recipe using just chicken thigh meat.</p>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol> 
<li><b>IF</b> using whole <b>CHICKENS</b> wash them, remove the 
  stuff packed inside and excessive fat. Put them side by side in a heavy 
  bottomed pot. 
  <br><b>IF</b> using whole joints, such as thighs, cut them 
  into convenient serving pieces. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver 
  knife and soft faced mallet are perfect for this.
  <br><b>IF</b> using just meat (my recommendation), cut it into largish 
  bite size pieces. Use chicken broth in place of half the water if 
  possible.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into thick slices. Peel <b>TURNIPS</b> 
  and dice them about 1/2 inch on a side. Trim <b>Leeks</b>, keeping 
  only the white and light green. Split them in half and rinse out sand, 
  then slice crosswise about 1/2 inch wide. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/li_leekz.html"><b>Leeks</b></a> page. 
  Chop <b>ONION</b> coarse. Toss all these into the pot with the Chicken.
  </li>
<li>Toss in the <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>TARAGON</b> sprigs along with the 
  <b>Cloves</b>, <b>Wine</b> and enough cold <b>Water</b> to cover 
  everything.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
<ol start="4">
<li>Bring to a boil, skimming off any scum that comes to the surface. 
  Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer slowly for about 
  50 minutes for whole chickens or bone-in joints, a bit less for just 
  meat. Let cool to handling temperature.</li>
<li><b>IF</b> using Whole Chickens, pull them out and remove the skin. 
  Leave them to get cold, then cut into serving pieces, discarding 
  inedible parts. You may wish to refrigerate it so the sauce sticks 
  better.
  <br><b>IF</b> using Bone-in Joints Do the same as for whole chicken, 
  except it's already cut into serving pieces.
  <br><b>IF</b> using Boneless Meat, just fish it out and leave it to 
  get cold.</li>
<li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; strain <b>Broth</b> through a fine mesh strainer, 
  discarding solids. Let it sit for a while to settle, then pour the 
  clear liquid off, leaving any crud that sinks to the bottom. Defat 
  the stock using your gravy separator.</li>
<li>Boil the stock down by about 1/2 (you need 4 cups), then let cool.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs - 35 min work)
<ol start="8">
<li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b></li>
<li>Separate <b>Eggs</b>. Use whites for some other purpose.</li> 
<li>Measure out 4 cups of <b>Stock</b>.   
<li>Fry <b>Flour</b> gently in <b>Butter</b> to make a blonde roux. 
  Stir in just a little of the strained, defatted and cooled <b>Broth</b>. 
  Stirring constantly, add more broth in small amounts until you have a 
  smooth thin paste with no lumps. Stir in the rest of the 
  <b>Broth</b>.</li>
<li>Bring the <b>Broth</b> to a boil while stirring, and simmer stirring 
  often for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Let cool a minute, then stir in the <b>Cream</b>.</li>
<li>Beat the <b>Egg Yolks</b> and stir in a little of the hot 
  <b>Sauce</b>, then a little more until quite loose. Stir it all back 
  into the sauce, stirring vigorously as you do so and for another minute 
  or so.</li>
<li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Lemon 
  Juice</b>. Taste it as you do as you may not want all the lemon juice, 
  depending on taste.</li>
<li>Arrange <b>Chicken Pieces</b> in a serving dish. Pour the sauce 
  over to coat well. Chill in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>Just before serving, scatter some tarragon leaves over the top.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless chicken Meat. 
  This weight can be achieved by several means depending on how you wish 
  to serve the dish. The pattern recipe called for two whole large 
  chickens (about 8 pounds), cooked, skinned and cut into serving pieces. 
  If you use whole, bone-in thighs (my recommendation for bone-in parts), 
  you need about 7 pounds. You can also use just 3-3/4 pounds of 
  thigh/leg meat (which is how I make it). I wouldn't consider breast 
  meat because that of North American factory chickens tastes like 
  cardboard.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Turnips</h3> &nbsp; These are the spherical "white turnips" with 
  the purple tops for those of you who live in countries or regions 
  confused about what a "turnip" is. See our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_turnipx.html"><b>What is a Turnip?</b></a> page. 
  Select small ones, as large ones can be fibrous.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tarragon:</h3> &nbsp;  Unfortunately, here in North America, we 
  have little choice but to use Russian Tarragon. French Tarragon has 
  more complex and more intense flavor, but is very difficult to grow 
  commercially.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Heavy Cream</h3> &nbsp; In France "Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che" 
  would be used, but that can be a problem in much of North America 
  (Trader Joe's usually has it), so Heavy Whipping Cream may have to be 
  used. While the two have different cooking properties, it should not 
  be too much of a problem for this recipe.</li>
