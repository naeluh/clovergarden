Awesome flavor assures this dish will be a hit at buffet parties - make 
plenty. The pattern recipe was <i>Gibelotte de Lapin</i>, but rabbits 
are rather costly around here, and the recipe admits it can be made with 
chicken.

</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite-size pieces. If using bone-in, 
    cut into larger pieces.</li>
  <li>Clean <b>MUSHROOMS</b> and trim stems. Leave whole if small, cut in 
    half if medium and into quarters if large.</li>
  <li>Tie <b>Parsley</b>, <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b> together with 
    kitchen string (so they'll be easier to remove later).</li> 
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a high boil and stir in the <b>ONIONS</b> 
    for 1 minute only, then chill them in cold water.  Cut off just 
    enough of the stem end so you can peel the outer skin. Cut off the 
    minimum from the root end so the onions hold together well.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs) 
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into small pieces and fry it slowly in 
    <b>Butter</b> until the fat is translucent. Stir in the <b>Onions</b> 
    and fry over moderate heat, tumbling often until bacon is browned and 
    all its fat is mostly rendered. Remove <b>Onions</b> and <b>Bacon</b>, 
    leaving all the fat.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Chicken</b> in small batches until until lightly browned 
    all over, being careful not to burn the fond that forms in the pan. 
    Return any drained fat to the pan for the next batch.</li>
  <li>Drain excess fat from the pan, leaving about 1 T.
  <li>Return all <b>Chicken</b> to the pan and sprinkle with <b>Flour</b>. 
    Fry over moderate heat, tumbling often for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Add <b>White Wine</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and add 
    to the pan. Bring to a boil and add <b>Herbs</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. 
    Taste for <b>Salt</b> (it will depend on how salty your bacon is). 
    Cover tightly and simmer slowly for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions</b> and <b>Bacon</b> to the pan, plus up to 1/2 cup 
    <b>Stock</b> if needed. Bring back to a simmer and simmer slowly 
    for another 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Mushrooms</b> to the pan and simmer covered for another 10 
    minutes or until the chicken is tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mustard</b>. Serve hot garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This should be dark meat chicken, and weight 
  is for skinless, boneless meat. I usually use thigh / leg meat, but 
  if you aren't up to dismantling thighs you can use 3-3/4 pounds of 
  whole bone-in thighs cut into pieces - or the packaged boneless leg 
  meat that has recently appeared on the market (because the Russians 
  are no longer taking our surplus legs). The pattern  recipe called 
  for two 2-pound rabbits cut into 6 pieces each. For details see our  
  our <a href="../ingred/ar_rabbitz.html"><b>Rabbit</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/bd_chicken.html"><b>Chicken</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Pick out the smallest boiling onions you can 
  find in the onion bin - about 1 inch diameter is good. Those in the 
  photo were a little larger than I like, but they were what I could get 
  that day.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for veal or chicken 
  stock, but rabbit or pork stock would work fine too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be made ahead all the way to 
  adding the mustard. Refrigerated it can be held up to three days, then 
  just reheat, stir in the mustard and serve.</li>
