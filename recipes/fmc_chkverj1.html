Verjus provides a more interesting flavor than vinegar and a different 
sort of sourness (tartaric acid rather than acetic acid).  This recipe 
is simple and easy to make, and see <a href="fmc_chkverj1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite-size pieces. If using bone-in, 
    cut into larger pieces. Massage in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. 
    Refrigerate if you need time, but in any case, let the chicken come 
    to room temperature before frying (about 1/2 hour).</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b>, Leaving whole.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Parsley</b> for garnish.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs) 
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> and <b>Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan 
    (3-1/2 qt, 5 qt if bone in pieces) and fry <b>Chicken</b> and 
    <b>Garlic</b> over fairly low heat (pan temperature about 
    275&deg;F/135&deg;C) tumbling fairly often until lightly browned. 
    Watch that the fond adhering to the pan doesn't get too dark - should 
    be reddish brown, not chocolate.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> using skin-on joints, pour off the accumulated fats.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>White Wine</b> and simmer tightly covered for 10 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Pour in 1/3 c <b>Verjus</b> and immediately cover tightly to lock 
    in aromas. Simmer 5 minutes or so, tumbling chicken once.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Stock</b>, bring to a boil and simmer covered another 
    5 minutes or until chicken is tender (see <a href="fmc_chkverj1.html#05">
    <b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you are using skin-on joints and have drained the fat 
    as mentioned above, stir in 2 T <b>Butter</b>.</li>
  <li>Taste for seasoning. Add <b>Verjus</b> to taste, along with 
    <b>Salt</b> (the amount given presumes salt-free stock) and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sour Grapes</b> just long enough to warm through, 
    then serve, garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp;  I use thigh  meat, which has better flavor 
  and texture than the cardboard breast meat we get around here, but if 
  you aren't up to dismantling thighs you can use 5-3/4 pounds of whole 
  bone-in thighs cut into pieces (and a bigger pan) - or the packaged 
  boneless leg meat that appeared on the market when the Russians 
  stopped taking our surplus legs. The pattern  recipe called for leg 
  and thigh, bone in and skin on, cut into serving pieces - about 6 
  pounds. I cut into skinless boneless chunks because that's more 
  practical for buffet service, and I can use the skin and bones 
  for the stock. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bd_chicken.html"><b>Chicken</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>White Wine:</h3>This should be a crisp dry wine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Verjus:</h3> &nbsp; This is made from unripe 
  grapes. You can make your own if you can get the grapes (April to 
  June), or it is available bottled from California, and also Perigord, 
  France (but at considerably greater cost). For how to make it see our 
  recipe <a href="giv_verjus1.html"><b>Verjus</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a rather strong 
  home-made stock. I buy my chicken thighs whole and use the skins and 
  bones to make the stock a few hours or the day before starting this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; If making ahead, stop cooking before the 
  chicken is quite tender so it will not start breaking up into shreds 
  during reheating.</li>
