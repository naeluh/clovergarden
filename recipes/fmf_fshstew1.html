A flavorful and satisfying seafood stew that can be made as a soup by 
adding more stock. The difficult part (fish disassembly and stock 
making) can be done ahead (see <a href="fmf_fshstew1.html#05"><b>Notes 5,6</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs (variable))
  <ol>
  <li>Scale <b>FISH</b>. Clean out the innards (most fish markets around 
    here will do these steps for you without charge). Cut off the heads, 
    fillet, and skin fillets. Cut into about 1 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Fish Stock</b>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove Gills from <b>FISH HEADS</b> and discard. Cut off collar 
      (cut at point of chin and bend it back). Split heads lengthwise. 
      Rinse them out well.</li>
    <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> and <b>CARROTS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. 
      Mix.</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, melt <b>Butter</b> and add <b>Onion mix</b>. 
      Fry stirring until onions are translucent but not at all browned.
      </li>
    <li>Add <b>Fish Heads</b>, <b>Bones</b> and <b>Fins</b> (skins only 
      if known not to be oily or have a strong flavor), <b>Parsley</b>, 
      <b>Thyme</b>, <b>Bay Leaf</b>, <b>Tomato Paste</b> and about 5 cups 
      of <b>Water</b> to cover the fish well. Bring to a simmer. skim and 
      simmer covered very slowly for 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Strain through a fine strainer. Let the stock stand for a bit so 
      bits drop to the bottom, then decant.</li>
    <li>Remove all oil (use your gravy separator).</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li> 
  <li>Scrub <b>MUSSELS</b> if using live mussels. If using frozen meat, 
    just thaw. Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and pull gut as needed. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In your stew pot, fry <b>ONIONS</b> until translucent. Add 
    <b>Herbs</b> and drained <b>Potatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Calvados</b> and <b>White Wine</b>. Add <b>Salt</b>, 
    <b>Pepper</b>, <b>Cayenne</b> and <b>Saffron</b>. Pour in enough of 
    the <b>Fish Stock</b> to just cover. Bring to a simmer and simmer 
    covered for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Layer the <b>Fish</b> on evenly and add enough more <b>Fish 
    Stock</b> to not quite cover. Layer the <b>Shrimp</b> and 
    <b>Mussels</b> evenly on the top (do not add more stock unless making 
    soup). Bring back to a simmer, cover tightly and simmer slowly for 
    another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>If using whole mussels, pull any that didn't open, they may be bad.
  </li>
  <li>Give it a stir, fish out the herbs, and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for whole fish, "heads guts and 
  feathers", because you need to make fish stock. These fish should yield 
  somewhere near 1-1/2 pounds of flesh, depending on type of fish used. 
  A variety of fish can be used, but select fish that stay firm enough to 
  be used in soup, are of light to medium flavor, and that produce a good 
  soup stock. My favorite is always <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html">
  <b>Golden Pompano</b></a>. For a vast amount of information on fish 
  and  cooking them see our <a href="../ingred/seafish.html">
  <b>Fish</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose are very good for 
  this recipe. Avoid "Klondike Gold" type potatoes which turn to mush if 
  cooked a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mussels:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 12 ounces of 
  whole live mussels in the shell. Small mussels make for a picturesque 
  stew - but the ones common here in Los Angeles are just too large. 
  They also require scrubbing, there's a risk some will be bad and not 
  open, they aren't particularly suited to buffet service, and they 
  aren't nearly as economical as frozen mussel meat which runs around 
  2011 US $4.29 per pound in the Asian markets.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Do not use pre-cooked shrimp. They are almost 
  flavorless and contribute nothing to the soup.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Do-Ahead</h3> &nbsp; Preparing the fish and the fish stock can be 
  done even days ahead. Freeze the fillets quickly in one layer. After 
  straining and oil removal, reheat the stock to boiling, let cool a 
  little (keeping lid on) and pour into jars (empty pickle jars work 
  fine). Put the lids on tight immediately, and after cooling 
  refrigerate. It'll keep for weeks.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; I very often have plenty of 
  plain fish stock already made, and fillets in the freezer. In this case 
  I make the stock with the vegetables and 4-1/2 cups of plain fish 
  stock.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Mods:</h3> &nbsp; I have modified the procedure considerably 
  for my convenience, for buffet service, and because here in Sunny 
  Southern California we don't fire up ovens unless we really need to. 
  The pattern recipe slices the potatoes thin and places them over the 
  (unfried) onions. The fish fillets are placed on top whole. Seasonings and 
  liquids are added and the pot is brought to a simmer for 10 minutes. The 
  mussels and shrimp are placed on top, the pot covered and placed in a 
  preheated 400&deg;F oven for 20 minutes.</li>
