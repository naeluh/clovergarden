The name means "Garnished Sauerkraut". The French inherited this very 
popular dish when they acquired Alsace and Lorraine in 1648. See  
<a href="fmm_choug1.html#10"><b>Method</b></a> and <a href="fmm_choug1.html#11"><b>Presentation</b></a>.

<p>While preparation of the sauerkraut is pretty standard, the 
combination of meats and vegetables is not standardized, though potatoes 
are usually included.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Drain <b>SAUERKRAUT</b> and wring it out. Soak a few minutes in two 
    changes of water. Drain well and wring out excess water  
    (see <a href="fmm_choug1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise, then slice medium crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into chunks about 3/4 inch long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into pieces about 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MEATS</b> as desired, or leave whole if you wish 
   (see <a href="fmm_choug1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a>). Mix all.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into chunks or as desired. Put in a 
    pot with plenty of lightly salted water, bring to a boil and simmer 
    until just cooked through. Cool and hold.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Broth items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (2 hrs or more)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a large saut&eacute; pan or Dutch oven (you'll need 4-1/2 to 
    5 quart size), heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Bacon</b>, stirring for a 
    couple minutes. Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until 
    translucent but not browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauerkraut</b> and <b>Broth mix</b>, cover tightly and 
    simmer slowly for an 1 hour or more - but see 
    <a href="fmm_choug1.html#10"><b>Note-10</b></a> for traditional method. Monitor 
    liquid, there should be enough for steaming the meats.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Carrots</b> into the Sauerkraut, then place the 
    <b>Meat Mix</b> over the Sauerkraut. Simmer covered for another 
    45 minutes to an hour, monitoring the liquid. The Sauerkraut should 
    be very wet with some free liquid, but not swimming. Check salt - 
    need depends on your ingredients.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, warm the <b>Potatoes</b> in boiling water or 
    however is convenient for you. Drain.</li>
  <li>On a heated platter, lay out <b>Sauerkraut</b> surrounded by 
    <b>Potatoes</b> and garnished with the <b>Meats</b> - or - see 
    <a href="fmm_choug1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Serve with French Bread,  Beer or Riesling wine, and 
    <b>Mustards</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp; a 32 oz (900g) jar will probably be labeled 
  24 oz (700g - 1-1/2 pound) drained weight, but by time you wring it out 
  really well it'll be about 1 pound. Some fine sauerkrauts are now 
  imported from Poland, my usual brand is Vitarol. Just because 
  sauerkraut comes in a bag rather than a jar doesn't automatically mean 
  it's better. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_skrautz.html">
  <b>Sauerkraut</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp;French sources say when sauerkraut is 
  cooked in wine it needs to be rinsed until it is no longer briny.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; This should be slab bacon so the pieces can be 
  cut appropriately. You may be able to find a good brand of bacon "ends 
  and pieces" that's lean enough and in thick enough pieces to use.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Juniper Berries:</h3> &nbsp; These seem a bit hard to find here in 
  Southern California, but are considered essential. One recommendation 
  is to use 1/2 cup of Gin instead. I would recommend a real Dutch 
  Genever (Jenever) which is flavored only with juniper berries rather 
  than mixed with a lot of herbs as in London style Gin.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for Chicken stock, but I use 
  Pork stock, which is what I usually have the most of - and all the 
  meats are pork anyway.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Riesling is the proper wine to use for this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Meats:</h3> &nbsp; Most common are smoked pork and various 
  precooked sausages, including Frankfurters, Polish Kielbasa, Bratwurst, 
  etc., and sometimes boiled ham. I wouldn't hesitate to toss in 
  Philippine hamonados either.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Mustard:</h3> &nbsp; Often several different mustards are made 
  available, but good mustards, not that fluorescent yellow stuff.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, this is done in a large Dutch 
  oven, brought to a boil on the stove top, then placed in a 
  325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven for about 4 hours, with the meats going 
  in for the last hour. Here in Southern California we don't fire up an 
  oven unless we really need to, and don't need our sauerkraut cooked 
  that long, so this recipe uses the stove top.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Presentation:</h3> &nbsp; Chefs often serve this garnished with 
  whole charcoal grilled sausages, large slabs of smoked pork, etc. for 
  an impressive show. My presentation is designed for buffet service, 
  everything in pieces and even mixed a bit, so some clown can't walk 
  off with all the sausages. The photo shows this dish served on a 
  platter, but I usually serve buffet style in an electric skillet set 
  to "keep warm".</li>
