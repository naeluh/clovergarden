This stew is very popular in Provence, with several names and many minor 
variations (see <a href="fmm_cowalag1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).  The name means 
"Beef in the manner of a lady from Gordes".

<p>This dish is best made a day ahead (or more, refrigerated) and warmed 
up slowly before serving. It is served with Macaronade pasta, not rice or 
bread, but I was unable to replenish my supply, so I broke up some 
Mezzanelli, a reasonable substitute.</p>
  
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (13+ hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> as needed and cut into cubes about 1-1/2 inch on 
    a side.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> moderately. Slice <b>ONIONS</b> thick. 
    Chop <b>CELERY</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>beef</b>. Package 
    in a non-reactive bowl, or polyurethane bag. Stash in the fridge 
    for at least 12 hours. Turn now and then.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TINY ONIONS</b>. Scald them for one minute in rapidly 
    boiling water, then chill in cold water. Cut just a little 
    off the top end, peel back the dry layers and cut off. Cut as little 
    as possible from the root end so the onion will remain intact with 
    cooking.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into chunks about 3/4 inch long 
    (see <a href="fmm_cowalag1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).  Mix with peeled <b>Onions</b>, 
    bag and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs) 
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Fish <b>BEEF</b> out of the marinade and drain well. Keep all 
    the marinade.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (see <a href="fmm_cowalag1.html#07">
    <b>Note-7</b></a>), heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Beef</b> until all 
    exuded liquid has evaporated and beef is lightly browned on all 
    sides.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Brandy</b> over the <b>Beef</b> and light it off. Stand 
    back, and use great care, it'll nearly explode.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Marinade</b> over the <b>Beef</b>. Bring to a boil, cover 
    tightly and simmer slowly until Beef is reasonably tender. This could 
    be as little as 1 hour or as much as 2, depending on size of cubes, 
    toughness of cut and length of time in marinade. Don't simmer too 
    long - beef chunks need to be firm enough to remove intact from the 
    sauce. They'll get more cooking later. Make sure it does not run low 
    on liquid - liquid should nearly cover the Beef, add wine or broth 
    if needed. </li>
  <li>Fish <b>Beef</b> out of the pot and set aside, retaining all 
    liquid.</li>
  <li>Strain the sauce, squeezing the solids so as to get as much 
    flavorful liquid as possible. Discard the solids, and if there is 
    excessive fat, defat the liquid using your gravy separator. Return 
    liquid to the pan.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Flour</b> with 1/3 cup of cold <b>Beef Broth</b> until 
    there are no lumps. stir into the rest of the <b>Beef Broth</b> until 
    well blended. Stir <b>Broth</b> into the <b>Sauce</b> until well 
    blended.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Beef</b> to the pan and stir in <b>Carrot mix</b>.
    Bring to a slow simmer for 30 minutes or until vegetables are 
    cooked through.  Be careful the sauce doesn't get too thick. 
    Add a little more broth if needed.</li> 
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Pasta</b>. The traditional pasta for this is 
    French Macaronade, much like our small macaroni but much longer and 
    gently curved. For details see our <a href="../ingred/pa_euro.html">
    <b>European Pasta and Noodles</b></a> page.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Chuck Roast:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck (Shoulder - any part) is good 
  for this recipe, flavorful but not too tough. Weight is for boneless 
  and trimmed of all excess fat and membranes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Savory:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this, substitute some 
  Marjoram or Oregano.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Wine:</h3> &nbsp; If possible, use a Burgundy type wine 
  (Pinot Noir).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beef Broth:</h3> &nbsp; I've usually made plenty of this by 
  simmering the trimmings cut from the hunk of Beef I bought for this 
  recipe.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tiny Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Pearl onions are fine, but so small 
  they're really a hassle (and they're expensive). I pick out the 
  smallest ones from a bin of boiling onions at a local market - about 
  1 inch diameter is good.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; One of the most common variations is to 
  use about 5 ounces of unsmoked pork belly cut in small cubes for 
  frying instead of the oil. Variations of the herbs and vegetables are 
  common. If it is to be served cold a split calf foot is tossed in for 
  the simmering stage so the sauce will gel.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; For a half recipe I use a 3-1/2 quart 
  saut&eacute; pan, for a whole recipe a 5 quart. If you use a Dutch 
  oven, deeper but less bottom area, you may have to fry in two batches. 
  Some recipes are done on the stove top as given here. Others do the 
  simmering stage in the oven, tightly sealed in a Dutch oven, 
  275&deg;F/135&deg;C for 4 hours.</li>
