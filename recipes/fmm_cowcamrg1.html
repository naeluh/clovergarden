<p>This dish is properly served with Macaronade pasta, not rice bread or 
potatoes. I couldn't replenish my supply, so I broke up some Mezzanelli, 
a reasonable substitute.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (13+ hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> as needed and cut into cubes about 1-3/4 inch on 
    a side.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice thick, Chop <b>ONIONS</b> coarse. 
    Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>beef</b>. Package 
    in a non-reactive bowl or polyurethane bag. Stash in the fridge 
    for at least 6 hours. Turn now and then.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into small dice.</li>
  <li>Lightly crush <b>GARLIC</b>.</li>
  <li>Pit <b>Olives</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs) 
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Fish <b>BEEF</b> out of the marinade and drain well. Keep all 
    the marinade.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or Dutch oven (see <a href="fmm_cowcamrg1.html#05">
    <b>Pan Size</b></a>), heat <b>Olive Oil</b> (Pure, not Virgin) and 
    fry <b>Bacon</b> until lightly crisp. Remove bacon crisps and set 
    aside, leaving the oil behind.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Beef</b> into the hot oil and fry stirring until lightly 
    browned all over.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Marinade</b> over the <b>Beef</b>, along with <b>Wine</b>, 
    <b>Stock</b>, <b>Garlic</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    cover tightly and simmer slowly until Beef is reasonably tender, 
    remembering it's going to get another 40 minutes or so. Time could 
    be as little as 1 hour or as much as 2 depending on size of pieces, 
    toughness of cut and length of marinade step. Make sure it does 
    not run low on liquid - the Beef should be nearly covered.</li>
  <li>Strain out the liquid, returning all the solids to the pan. Defat 
    the liquid using your gravy separator and return to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato Paste</b>, <b>Olives</b> and reserved 
    <b>Bacon Crisps</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer tightly covered 
    for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Pasta</b>. The traditional pasta for this is 
    French Macaronade, much like our small macaroni but much longer and 
    gently curved. For details see our <a href="../ingred/pa_euro.html">

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Chuck Roast:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck (Shoulder - any part) is good 
  for this recipe, flavorful but not too tough. Weight is for boneless 
  and trimmed of excess fat and membranes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Wine:</h3> &nbsp; If possible, use a Burgundy type wine 
  (Pinot Noir).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Beef Broth:</h3> &nbsp; I've usually made plenty of this by 
  simmering the trimmings cut from the hunk of Beef I bought for this 
  recipe.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Olives, Green &amp; Black:</h3> &nbsp; These must be Mediterranean 
  salt and oil cured black olives and cracked green olives. Canned black 
  salad olives and Spanish cocktail olives will not do - wrong flavor. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pan Size:</h3> &nbsp; For 1/2 recipe I use a 3-1/2 quart saute pan, 
  for the full recipe a 5 quart. If you use a Dutch oven, deeper but with 
  less bottom area, you'll probably have to fry the beef in two batches.
