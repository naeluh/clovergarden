Beef Cheeks are tender, moist and delicious cooked this way - and it's a 
complete dinner - no side dishes needed (though a salad before or after 
would be nice). See <a href="fmm_cowchks1.html#09"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<p>This is a "chef dish" and a bit of a production, but it's not really 
difficult. It can be done in stages, most of it even a day ahead.</p>
 
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 to 2 days - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF CHEEKS</b> as needed (weight given is after 
    trimming)</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Dice <b>CELERY</b> small. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>beef</b>. Package 
    in a non-reactive bowl or 2 mil polyethylene bag. Stash in the fridge 
    for at least 1 day, preferably 2 days. Turn now and then.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 hrs - 1 hr work) 
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Fish <b>Beef Cheeks</b> out of the marinade. Drain well, brush off 
    the solids and pat dry with paper towels. Keep all the marinade, 
    including solids.</li>
  <li>Rub <b>Beef Cheeks</b> <u>lightly</u> with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>In heavy bottomed non-reactive pot or Dutch oven that will hold at 
    least 4 quarts, melt <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Beef Cheeks</b> in 
    batches until lightly browned, being careful not to burn the butter. 
    Remove and set aside as they are done (See <a href="fmm_cowchks1.html#07">
    <b>Note-7</b></a>).</li>
  <li>After all the Beef Cheeks are removed, add to the pot the reserved 
    marinade, the <b>Beef Stock</b> and <b>Calf Foot</b>. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Tuck the <b>Beef Cheeks</b> into the pot. Cover tightly, bring to 
    a boil and simmer slowly until cheeks are tender (about 3-1/2 hours) 
    - or, see <a href="fmm_cowchks1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>. Turn the cheeks over 
    every 45 minutes or so.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Meanwhile:</u></b> &nbsp; -  &nbsp; (45 min - 25 min work)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Cut <b>Bacon</b> into about 1/4 inch cubes and fry until almost 
    getting crisp. Drain and set aside (hold some of the fat).</li>
  <li>Stem <b>Mushrooms</b> and cut in half, or however is appropriate 
    for the kind of mushrooms you are using. Steam until just cooked 
    through. Mix with Bacon.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Carrots</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks. Steam until 
    tender. Mix with Mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>Onions</b> in boiling water 1 minute, then quench in cold 
    water. Cut a little off the top and peel back the dry layers. Cut 
    as little as you can from the root end so they hold together. Steam 
    until just cooked through. Mix with Mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>Pasta</b> the usual way until <i>al dente</i> - don't 
    overcook! Tumble with a few drops of the bacon fat and mix with the 
    Mushrooms.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 20 min work)
  <ol start="14">
  <li>Fish out the <b>Beef Cheeks</b> and set aside.</li>
  <li>Strain the liquid through a fine strainer. Discard the solids 
    (well, not the calf feet, which are very tasty at this point. They 
    can be either set aside as a snack for the cook, or the recoverable 
    material can be cut from the bones and added to the cheeks.</li>
  <li>Defat the sauce using your gravy separator, then simmer it down 
    to the amount you will need (see <a href="fmm_cowchks1.html#09"><b>Comments</b></a>). 
    Keep hot.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beef Cheeks</b> as desired. Arrange with the 
    <b>Pasta mix</b>, cover with foil and warm it all back up in a 
    350&deg;/175&deg;C oven for about 15 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Pour sauce over and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Cheeks:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after trimming excess fat. Do 
  not over-trim connective tissue. To get 4 pounds trimmed, you'll need 
  to buy about 6-1/2 pounds untrimmed. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_cheekz.html"><b>Beef Cheeks</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kosher Salt:</h3> &nbsp; In most cases there is no purpose to 
  using kosher salt - if you don't want iodine, there's plenty of 
  regular no-iodine salt. For coating meat though, that's what kosher 
  salt was invented for. Diamond Crystal brand is best because it is 
  fluffier.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Calf Foot:</h3> &nbsp; Any ethnic meat market should have these, 
  and even some supermarkets. If not already sawed up, have the butcher 
  saw it into medium size pieces. This is expected, so there should be 
  no charge. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_footz.html">
  <b>Calf Foot</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; Regular white mushrooms can be used, but I 
  use King Trumpet mushrooms which I prefer for both flavor and texture. 
  Others, of course, can also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tiny Onions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "pearl 
  onions", but I find these rather tedious to deal with. I go to one 
  of the markets that has a bin of Boiling Onions, and pick out the 
  smallest ones to use for recipes like this.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Large Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "large 
  shells", but I prefer a pasta with more shape integrity, so I used 
  medium pipes.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Browning:</h3> &nbsp;  How do you tell if something almost black 
  to start with is "lightly browned"? The surface will become a little 
  dry and a little stiff.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe set up the meats and stock 
  as above, but cooked in a 325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven for 4 hours, 
  turning the Cheeks every hour. I simmered this on the stove top where 
  I could monitor it closely, and that worked just as well.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  If you have some other vegetable side dish 
  this could be simplified to just the pasta dressed with the bacon and 
  some bacon fat. In my opinion, the sauce could use a little thickening 
  with roux. A tablespoon of flour could be fried lightly in a 
  tablespoon of the bacon fat, chilled and added bit by bit as the 
  sauces is simmered down, until you get the consistency you want.
