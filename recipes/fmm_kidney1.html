An excellent dish for those of us who like kidneys. I made a big batch 
for a party recently - there was none left for me. It goes very well 
with rice and a salad - and red wine. This recipe reheats very well.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - Can be done a day ahead 
    and refrigerated)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove fat and membranes from <b>BEEF KIDNEYS</b> (see 
    <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html#prep"><b>Beef Kidneys, Prep</b></a>). 
    Soak in three changes of salted water for about 1/2 hour total. Place 
    kidneys in a pot with plenty of water to cover and bring to a boil for 
    a couple of minutes. This drives the blood out of the kidneys, so there will be 
    a <u>lot</u> of foam. Drain and rinse well. Clean pot and do the boiling 
    once more. Rinse and let cool. Slice 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>While the kidneys are soaking, render the fat (see <a href="fmm_kidney1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b>, <b>ONIONS</b> and <b>CARROTS</b> thin. 
    Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hours)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Melt 1 T of the <b>Fat</b> in a coverable saut&eacute; pan or 
    similar and stir in the <b>Vegetable mix</b>. Fry over moderate heat, 
    stirring until threatening to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Flour</b> and fry stirring another minute.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with the <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Add the <b>Bouquet 
    Garni</b>. Place sliced <b>Kidneys</b> over the vegetables. Add 
    the <b>Wine</b>, bring to a simmer and simmer covered for about 
    1-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li>Remove the <b>Kidneys</b> (tongs or chopsticks). 
    Strain out all other solids, pressing well to save as much of the 
    liquid as possible. Discard the solids.</li>
  <li>Place the liquids in a Saut&eacute; pan. In a small bowl mix 
    <b>Cream</b> and <b>Mustard</b>, then stir into the liquid. Bring to 
    a simmer and reduce to the sauce consistency you want (it should be 
    fairly liquid).</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Kidneys</b> into the sauce just long enough to come up to 
    temperature. Serve garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; For details on buying and preparation 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a> 
  page. This recipe can also be made with pork or lamb kidneys, with a 
  significant difference in flavor and texture.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fat:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is supposed to use kidney fat, and you 
  have just removed some from the kidneys. Slice the fat into small pieces, 
  put it in a small skillet with 1/8 inch water and bring to a slow boil. 
  When the water is gone and you hear frying sounds, turn the heat to very 
  low - the temperature of the oil should never get above about 
  312&deg;F/155&deg;C. When the solids have become fairly crisp, pour out 
  the oil through a paper towel lined strainer. You can eat the crisps 
  with a little salt. You'll have plenty of fat left after this recipe, 
  use it for other frying.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bouquet Garni:</h3> &nbsp; A simple bouquet made from 4 sprigs 
  Parsley, 2 sprigs Thyme and 1 Bay Leaf is fine. Usually these would 
  be tied into a bundle, but since all solids get strained out - just 
  toss 'em in.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I've modified the method (but not the ingredients) 
  to be easier to do in our kitchens, especially since here in Sunny Southern 
  California we don't heat up an oven unless we really need to. Having made 
  it the original way the first time I can vouch for the results.</li>
