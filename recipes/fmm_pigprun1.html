  <b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li><b>IF Needed:</b> &nbsp; set <b>PRUNES</b> to soak in cold water 
    for a couple of hours. (see <a href="fmm_pigprun1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>)</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>SAUCE</u></b> - Make this First  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b>, <b>CARROT</b> and <b>CELERY</b> small. Mix</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan melt 2 T <b>Butter</b>. Stir in <b>Onion 
    mix</b>, <b>Bouquet Garni</b>, <b>Cloves</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Fry stirring over moderate flame until onions are 
    light golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Wine</b>. Simmer for about 20 minutes, 
    adding water as needed.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: place soaked <b>Prunes</b> in a saucepan with just enough 
    water to cover. Bring to a simmer, cover and poach over very low flame 
    for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain the Sauce, discarding solids. You should end up with 1-1/4 to 
    1-1/2 cups.</li>
  <li>Work together 1 T soft <b>Butter</b> and  1 T flour to make a 
    <i>beurre mani&eacute;</i>. Break it into small pieces and stir them 
    into the sauce. Cook over low flame for a few minutes, stirring 
    frequently, until the lumps have all dissipated and the sauce is 
    somewhat thickened.
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Prunes</b> and cook  another minute or so. Keep 
    warm (or reheat when needed).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>CHOPS</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Season chops lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a heavy skillet and fry 
    <b>Chops</b> until golden brown on both sides. Keep warm.</li> 
  <li>Meanwhile: chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>To serve, arrange <b>Chops</b> on warm plates. Ladle some sauce over 
    and arrange a few <b>Prunes</b> around them. Garnish the chops with 
    chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Prunes:</h3> &nbsp; Our fresh California prunes need no soaking - 
  but those from other sources, or if stored too long, may need soaking. 
  Our prunes are also rather large, and very sweet, so I cut them into 
  two or three pieces.  If I had small seed-in prunes I would leave 
  them whole, pit to be dealt with at the table. This would be the best 
  looking form for fancy presentation of whole chops.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Chops:</h3> &nbsp; Whole chops, bone on, make the most 
  impressive presentation, but present difficulties. By time meat at the 
  bone is fully cooked, the rest is a bit dry, knives are needed at the 
  table and the bone is a bit messy to deal with because it's got sticky 
  sauce all over it. For a buffet presentation I use pork cut to the 
  thickness of pork chops and into strips about 3/4 inch wide by 2 inches 
  long, with no bones.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bouquet Garni:</h3> &nbsp; A simple bouquet made 
  from 4 sprigs Parsley, 2 sprigs Thyme and 1 Bay Leaf is fine. Usually these 
  would be tied into a bundle, but since all solids get strained out - just 
  toss 'em in.</li>
