This famous soup is variously made, but is always pur&eacute;ed and 
always includes fennel - if you don't have a bulb, use seeds.  This is 
a rich soup, so serve in modest quantity.

<p>The method I have composed here avoids using a food mill, which most 
North America kitchens don't have, but which is essential for traditional 
methods to eliminate fish bones, peels, etc..</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare your <b>FISH</b> (see <a href="fof_proven1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). 
    Scale, clean and fillet the fish. Skin the fillets and put them in 
    the fridge. Complete instructions will be found at 
    <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning &amp; Filleting 
    Round Fish</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Put all the heads (with gills removed), bones and fins (include 
    skins only if approved by our page for that fish, some have too 
    strong a flavor) in a pot with 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil 
    with the pot open and skim the foam as it comes to a boil, then 
    cover and simmer slowly for about 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain the fish stock, discarding the solids and defat it (use your 
    gravy separator).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.Trim <b>LEEK</b> to white and light green 
    (see <a href="fof_proven1x.html#leek"><b>Photo</b></a>), split 
    lengthwise down to the root end  and wash well . Slice thin. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and slice medium. Slice <b>FENNEL</b> thin. Mix all.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 3/4 inch dice.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (1.5 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> 
    over moderate heat, stirring often, until light golden.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; cut <b>Fish Fillets</b> into the size chunks you 
    want for service - see <a href="fof_proven1.html#03"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan, bring the <b>Fish Stock</b> up to a boil, then stir 
    in <b>Fish Chunks</b>. As soon as you see the first bubbles turn the 
    heat off or to extremely low and allow to poach for about 5 to 10 
    minutes depending on thickness. Lift out with a slotted spoon and 
    set aside. A few fragments of fish left in the stock won't hurt 
    anything.</li> 
  <li>When Saut&eacute; is done, stir in <b>All Soup Items</b>, including 
    the <b>Fish Stock</b>, and bring to a boil. Turn to a simmer and 
    cover. Cook until potatoes are well cooked.</li>
  <li>Remove the <b>Bay Leaf</b> and <b>Herb Stems</b>. Run all the rest 
    in your food processor until well pur&eacute;ed (or run through a 
    food mill as traditionally done in France).</li>
  <li>Return to the pot, season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring 
    to a simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: Put your tea kettle on and boil up some water - because 
    this soup may look plenty liquid in the pot, but when poured over a 
    piece of toast in a bowl it may turn into paste. Dilute with 
    <u>boiling</u> water as needed.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot - see <a href="fof_proven1.html#03"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li> 
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; These should be whole salt water fish, with heads 
  and tails - one or several varieties. Select fish that make a good fish 
  stock and also stay fairly firm when wet cooked. Avoid both the mildest 
  and the strongest fish. You want your fish stock fairly light, but not 
  flavorless. My usual choice is <a href="../ingred/sf_pompcz.html">
  <b>Golden Pompano</b></a>. For more see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large file). You can probably ask your fish market to scale and 
  gut the fish, but from there on it's up to you. For complete instructions 
  see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning &amp; Filleting Round 
  Fish</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Saffron:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1/2 t ground 
  saffron. That's about 1 gram and at anywhere between U.S.$5 and $18 
  per gram (depending on source) this is a pretty tall order. Even back 
  in 1964 Mapie, Countess de Toulouse-Lautrec, suggested turmeric as a 
  substitute, but turmeric doesn't have the aroma or flavor. Cheapskate 
  that I am, I compromise and put in a generous pinch of saffron threads 
  for aroma and 1/4 t turmeric for color.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rouille:</h3> &nbsp; This somewhat spicy sauce is used in Provence 
  with fish soup, raw vegetables and potatoes and is considered nearly 
  essential with this soup. It is  variously made - for a few recipes 
  see our <a href="fjd_rouille1.html"><b>Rouille</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; This soup is served in several ways, but 
  toasted bread and garlic are always included.
  <ol>
  <li><b>Pur&eacute;ed:</b> &nbsp; In this method the fish is simply 
    cooked in the soup rather than separately as described above (put it 
    in near the end of cooking). It gets pur&eacute;ed along with the 
    rest of the ingredients. A slice of toasted bread, rubbed with a cut 
    clove of garlic or spread with <i>Rouille</i>, is placed in a bowl 
    and the soup ladled over.</li>
  <li><b>Stacked:</b> &nbsp; In this method the fish is cooked separately 
    as I've indicated above, cut into fairly large chunks. A toast, rubbed 
    with garlic or smeared with <i>Rouille</i>, is placed in the bowl, a 
    chunk of fish is placed on top and the soup ladled over or around 
    according to presentation style, and perhaps a garnish.</li>
  <li><b>Buffet:</b> &nbsp; This is my California style service. The fish, 
    cut in smaller chunks, is stirred into the finished soup, which is 
    kept warm in a slow cooker. A bowl of toasted bread squares (cut 
    about 1 inch on a side (and rubbed with garlic if you have the 
    patience for it)) is placed on the table, and a bowl of 
    <i>Rouille</i> for those who desire it.  Encourage guests to put 
    the toast (spread with <i>Rouille</i> or not as they wish) in the 
    bowl before ladling in the soup, but there's no use bitching if 
    they don't do it that way.</li>
