<p>This recipe can be done ahead up to the "Finish" steps.</p>
  
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Thaw <b>FROG LEGS</b>, separate into individual legs. Rinse in 
  several changes of water and drain well.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>WATERCRESS</b>. Discard overly thick stems (larger than 
    1/4 inch). Blanch for 1 minute in boiling water, strain and refresh 
    with cold water. Wring out and chop coarse.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - alt 1 hr 
    <a href="fom_frogwc1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, melt <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Shallots</b> 
    until translucent. Stir in <b>Frog Legs</b> and fry tumbling now and 
    then for 2 minutes without browning. Boil off any liquid the Frog 
    Legs exude.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Wine</b> and <b>Fish Stock</b>. Bring to a simmer and 
    stir in <b>Nutmeg</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.  Simmer 
    covered until <b>Frog Legs</b> are sufficiently done. This is when 
    they start becoming disjointed, 10 minutes or a little more.</li>
  <li>Remove frog legs and set them aside until cool enough to handle. 
    Remove all bones, tossing the bones back into the stock. Simmer stock 
    another 20 minutes or so (but see <a href="fom_frogwc1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). Strain 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Frog meat</b> into pieces 3/8 to 1/2 inch long and toss 
    with the <b>Watercress</b> until well distributed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>When ready to serve - place a bowl over simmering water. Stir 
    together the <b>Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che</b>, <b>Butter</b> cut 
    into bits and <b>Egg Yolks</b>. Whip with a wire whisk until it about 
    doubles in volume, then pour immediately into another bowl to stop 
    cooking - you'll need a rubber spatula for this. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Soup Stock</b> up hot, but not boiling. Gradually 
    stir in the <b>Cream mix</b> and whip it smooth with the wire whisk. 
    Finally, stir in the <b>Frog - Watercress mix</b>.</li>     
  <li>Serve with crusty bread, a salad and Riesling wine or Beer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Frog Legs:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't live in one of the regions were 
  frog legs are traditional, look in Asian markets in the frozen food 
  cases. Here in Southern California they are frozen in bags weighing one 
  pound. For details see our <a href="../ingred/rp_frogz.html">
  <b>Frogs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Riesling Wine:</h3> &nbsp; The wine has a substantial influence 
  on the finished soup. Preferably use an Alsatian Riesling, but if not 
  available, another good quality Riesling will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This is something I always have on hand, 
  because I buy most of my fish whole. That's the only way you can tell 
  if the fish you're paying for is the fish you're getting - and I make 
  fish stock from the heads, bones and fins. For details of making and 
  storing fish stock see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">
  <b>Fish Stock</b></a> page, and also <a href="fom_frogwc1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very heavy 
  lightly soured cream with a fat content well over 30%. It is much 
  more resistant to curdling in hot soup than lower fat creams. I usually 
  get Bellwether Farms brand from Trader Joe's, which is 39% fat. 
  Beware of "Low Fat Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che", an American style 
  product stabilized with gums. Its OK for fruit topping but not for 
  cooking. If you can't get real Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che, use the 
  highest fat heavy cream you can find, and be careful you soup stays 
  below a simmer.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for a rather strong 
  fish stock made with vegetables. My fish stock is always plain, 
  because I don't know what cuisine it will be used for. To adjust, at 
  the time the frog bones are tossed back into the stock, I put in 6 oz 
  sliced onion, a rib of celery and a carrot, both sliced, a few springs 
  of parsley and a bay leaf. I simmer for about 45 minutes, before 
  straining.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is most appropriate as a soup 
  course at a sit down dinner, but I have, with care to temperatures, 
  served it at a small buffet in a slow cooker set to "keep warm".</li>
