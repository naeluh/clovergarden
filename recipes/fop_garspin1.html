<p>While the pattern recipe is fine for a small soup course as intended, 
I've made some additions to make it more suitable for buffet service or 
as a main dish soup (see <a href="fop_garspin1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). You may omit 
them if you wish.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min to 9 hr, depends on Chickpeas)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b>, remove stems and spin in your salad 
    spinner. Cook leaves lightly with 1 t Olive Oil 
    (see <a href="fop_garspin1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Squeeze out excess water and 
    chop medium.</li>
  <li>If using dried <b>CHICKPEAS</b> soak and cook as explained in 
    <a href="fop_garspin1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>, drain. If using canned, drain and 
    rinse.</li>
  <li>Crush about 2/3 of the <b>Chickpeas</b> fairly thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>POTATO</b> about 1/2 inch. Hold in cold water until needed.
    </li>
  <li>Separate the <b>Eggs</b>. Beat the yolks lightly (and use the 
    whites for some other purpose).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Bread</b> (IF using - see <a href="fop_garspin1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) 
    into crustless squares that will fit in the soup bowls.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a large sauce pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> 
    until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chickpeas</b> and 5 or 6 cups of <b>Water</b> 
    (see <a href="fop_garspin1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Bring to a simmer for 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>. Simmer for about 15 
    minutes or until Potatoes are cooked through.</li>
  <li>Season soup with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Spoon a little of the soup into the <b>Egg Yolks</b> and stir 
    well to loosen them. Stir <b>Egg Yolk mix</b> into the hot 
    <b>Soup</b>, stirring vigorously as you do so.</li>
  <li>Bring back to a simmer and serve over squares of <b>Bread</b> 
    (If using - see <a href="fop_garspin1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) and a drizzle of 
    <b>Olive Oil</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for a very good bunch which will 
  yield 1 cup cooked. For complete details on preparation and cooking 
  of spinach, see our <a href="../ingred/ch_spinachz.html">
  <b>Spinach</b></a> page. The pattern recipe admits to using a 10 ounce 
  package of frozen spinach.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chickpeas:</h3> &nbsp; (Garbanzo Beans) Generally canned Chickpeas 
  are acceptable for this soup (1 15 oz can is about 1 cup). To get 1 
  cup from dried, soak 1/2 cup of dried beans for 8 hours with 1 t Salt. 
  Drain, rinse and cook in lightly boiling water  until tender (1/2 to 
  3/4 hour). For details, see our <a href="../ingred/bp_chickz.html">
  <b>Chickpeas, (Kabul type)</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bread / Water:</h3> &nbsp; This should be French or Italian bread, 
  of course, not Wonder Bread<small>&reg;</small> or similar. Serving 
  soups over a slice of bread, or with a square on top to thicken the 
  soup is typical French. Personally, I usually have my soup without it 
  (but I'm not French). If you are skipping the bread, cut the amount 
  of water back to about 5 cups.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Changes:</h3> &nbsp; To make this recipe more suitable for larger 
  portions, I've fried some Onion in Olive Oil (the pattern recipe had 
  no onion and olive oil was used only as a seasoning after cooking) 
  and some diced Potato. These additions are common in neighboring Spain 
  and Portugal, so I'm confident they are also often used in 
  Proven&ccedil;e (Italians use pasta rather than potatoes).</li>
