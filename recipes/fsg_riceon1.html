Onion Rice originated in Lyon, This version is a little different from 
<a href="fsg_riceon1.html#05"><b>Traditional</b></a> in using caramelized onion rather then 
lightly fried.

<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> 
<ol>
  <li>Make <b>BROTH</b>: Chicken or Vegetable. See <a href="fsg_riceon1.html#03">
    <b>Broth</b></a> - (1 hr to 4 hours depending on type).
  <li>Caramelize the <b>ONIONS</b> per our recipe <a href="gkv_oncarm1.html">
    <b>Caramelized Onions</b></a> - (1-1/4 hrs, all work).</li>
  </ol> 
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
<ol start="3">
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Strip <b>THYME LEAVES</b> 
    from their stems (measure is after stripping). Mix, including   
    <b>Black Pepper</b>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="4">
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> using a Rice Cooker, you can use the same 3-1/2 quart 
    saut&eacute; pan used for the onions. <b><u>IF</u></b> cooking on the 
    stovetop, use a 3 quart sauce pan.</li>
  <li>Melt 1 T <b>Butter</b>. Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b>. Fry stirring just 
    until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>White Wine</b> and cook off until almost all liquid is 
    gone.</li>
  <li>Melt 3 T more <b>Butter</b> and stir in Rice. Rice should be lightly 
    but completely coated with Butter.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/2 to 2/3 of the <b>Caramelized Onions</b>, depending on how 
    strong you want the onion flavor. Stir until well distributed. The 
    rest are for garnish.</li>
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> cooking stovetop, stir in <b>Broth</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Cook using your normal heat and time for this amount of rice. When done, 
    let rest 10 minutes without uncovering. Uncover and fluff gently with a 
    fork. In Lyon, they would add more Butter at this point.</li>
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> using a rice cooker (recommended), scraoe the contents 
    of the saucepan into the cooker, then add <b>Broth</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Click to cook and leave the rest to the cooker. When it snaps to "Keep 
    Warm", let it sit 10 minutes without uncovering. Uncover and fluff gently 
    with a fork. In Lyon, they would add more Butter at this point.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, garnished with Caramelized Onions (and Cheese (if using)).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; In Lyon they use imported Long Grain Rice. Basmati is 
  common, but Thai Jasmine is considered acceptable. The photo example was 
  made with Dunar Elonga basmati.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thyme:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have fresh, use 1-1/4 teaspoon dried.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/mt_thymz.html"><b>Thyme</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken broth is normally used, but Vegetable broth 
  / stock can be used for vegetarian. For details, see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; (Optional) &nbsp;  Both recipes I have found for 
  this Caramelized Onion Rice call for Cheese. Traditional Lyon recipes I've 
  found do not call for cheese at all. One of the two recipes calls for 1 
  cup grated Parmesan stirred in after the rice is cooked. This is odd as 
  Parmesan is almost unknown in Lyon - the large Italian population of the 
  16th century is long gone. The other specifies shredded Gruy&egrave;re 
  used as a topping on individual bowls, along with Caramelized Onions. 
  If I were to use cheese, I'd definitely choose that option.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Traditional Method:</h3> &nbsp; In Lyon they use about 6 ounces onion, 
  fried translucent, then mix in the rice and broth. they cover the pan, 
  bring it to a boil, then rest it over low heat for 2 minutes. They then 
  replace the lid with a circle of parchment paper and bake the rice in a 
  preheated 350&deg;F/177&deg;C oven. Here in Southern California we don't 
  fire up an oven unless we really need to, so this recipe is made in the 
  pan on the stovetop, or in a rice cooker.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The French eat far less rice than any other 
  country in Europe, except in the city of Lyon. Italian merchants held 
  trade fairs in Lyon during the 15th and 16th century, and it became a 
  center for   silks, spices, and exotic foods, including rice, all coming 
  through Italy. The rice used in Lyon is imported long grain rice, most 
  often basmati.</li>
