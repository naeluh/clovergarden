An excellent recipe for when you need a side dish that's more of a 
feature than plate filler. It would also make an excellent vegetarian 
main dish served with rice or pasta.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Run a knife along the stems of the <b>CHARD</b> to remove the 
    green leaves. Run a vegetable peeler down the back side of each 
    stem to remove the threads, then cut into 2 inch lengths and those 
    lengthwise about 1/4 inch wide. Put immediately into cool water 
    acidulated with Citric Acid or Lemon Juice. Cut <b>Chard Greens</b> 
    into strips about 1/4 inch wide and 2 or 3 inches long.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and dice about 3/8 inch. Set in a non-reactive strainer 
    to drain.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise into quarters and slice thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>CARAWAY SEEDS</b> until very fragrant. Cool well and 
    grind fine.
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a tightly coverable pan (see <a href="fsv_chrdoni1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>), 
    heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Onions</b>, 1/3 t <b>Salt</b> and 
    3 T <b>Water</b>. Bring to a simmer, and simmer slowly over very 
    low heat for about 40 minutes, stirring now and then. The onions must 
    not dry out or brown at all.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a sauce pan, bring 8 cups of <b>Water</b> 
    to a boil. Drain the <b>Chard Stems</b> and stir into the water. 
    Simmer covered for about 15 minutes - the chard should still have 
    some crunch. Take it off the heat and let cool in it's water.</li>
  <li>When the <b>Onions</b> are done, stir in the <b>Chard Leaves</b> 
    and fry stirring until the water the Chard exudes has almost all 
    evaporated, but it is not actually frying.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Chard Stems</b>.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) heat 4 T 
    <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in the <b>Chard Stems</b> and fry stirring 
    over moderately high heat until they are very lightly colored.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion Mix</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Garlic</b>, 
    <b>Caraway</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a simmer 
    and simmer covered for 5 to 10 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro Leaves</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chard</h3> &nbsp; (the "Swiss" part is now redundant, Cardoons 
  are no longer called "Chard"). Choose the white stemmed kind, nice 
  large crisp leaves.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; Apparently Cilantro (Coriander Leaves) has 
  returned to France. This recipe comes from a book written by a French 
  restaurateur, in France and originally in French. Through the 
  Renaissance Cilantro was used everywhere in Europe, then was completely 
  supplanted by Parsley, everywhere but parts of Portugal and Italy. By 
  this time, the Spanish and Portuguese had already taken Cilantro to 
  the New World, where it is very popular to this day.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pan:</h3> &nbsp; I highly recommend a coverable wok for this, as 
  it's by far the best pan for sweating down piles of greens. If your's 
  isn't coverable, you can transfer the onions to a wok just before 
  adding the chard leaves. The wok I use is the excellent Calphalon 13 
  inch multi-ply, with a 12-1/2 inch (32 cm) stainless lid purchased 
  from an Asian market.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3> &nbsp; The photo with the pattern recipe did 
  not reflect the actual recipe. The chard stems were diced, not sliced, 
  there was no evidence of tomato, and the neat tiny white onion rings, 
  all about the same size, obviously hadn't been cooked with the chard. 
  Clearly, you have some latitude here.</li>
