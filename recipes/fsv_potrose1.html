These are delicious! I have modified the pattern recipe which used Idaho 
potatoes and sliced them before frying, but I'm sure somebody in France has 
done the same.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> (this recipe doesn't work well with unpeeled 
    potatoes). Place in a saucepan with plenty of water to cover. Bring to 
    a boil and simmer until done through (a sharp skewer doesn't encounter 
    a hard spot in the center). Drain well.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: remove <b>ROSEMARY</b> leaves from the stems and chop 
    them as fine as you can get them. Measure is after chopping. Then 
    put them in your mortar and pound to get it really fine. You can toss 
    in the salt and peppercorns here for easier crushing. Alternately, see 
    <a href="fsv_potrose1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a skillet sized so the potatoes just fit in one layer, heat 
    <b>Butter</b> and <b>Olive Oil</b> (see <a href="fsv_potrose1.html#02">
    <b>Method</b></a>). Fry over gentle heat (this is butter which burns 
    easily) tumbling often until golden as uniformly as you can get 
    something that's a bit irregular in shape.</li>
  <li>Pour out the excess butter and oil, then, over very moderate heat, 
    stir in <b>Rosemary</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Tumble the 
    potatoes until uniformly coated.</li>
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature. This dish can be rewarmed in 
    a skillet or in the oven.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes work very 
  well here. Preferably get really small potatoes, smaller than a plum if 
  you can. Select them to be as spherical as possible so they'll roll around 
  well in the skillet. If you have to use bigger ones, you'll need to slice 
  them about 1/4 inch thick before frying.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; By far the best way to make this dish is in a 
  quality electric skillet with a good non-stick coating, because the 
  temperature can be so precisely controlled, it's roomy enough for 
  plenty of potatoes and it doesn't tie up the stove.
  <ol>
  <li>Peel enough potatoes to fill the skillet in a single layer with 
    enough room left to move them around.</li>
  <li>Pour in water to cover, bring to a boil and cook covered until 
    potatoes are tender through.</li>
  <li>Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon. Pour out the water, wipe 
    the skillet and return the potatoes. Add sufficient butter and olive 
    oil for the amount of potatoes. Fry uncovered at 300&deg;F/150&deg;C 
    (that's about the smoke point for butter) rolling the potatoes 
    around until nicely browned on all sides.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: chop and pound the Rosemary, or see <a href="fsv_potrose1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and pour out the oils. You 
    can keep some oil in the pan, or wipe it and add about 2 T fresh butter.
    </li>
  <li>Return the potatoes and sprinkle over the Rosemary, Salt and Pepper. 
    bring back up to a very low frying temperature rolling the potatoes 
    around frequently. Then set to "keep warm", and it's ready to serve.
    </li>
  </ol>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rosemary:</h3> &nbsp; An Indian <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html">
  <b>Mixie</b></a> with the chutney can will reduce the rosemay to powder 
  in 4 seconds. You may need to add a little more fresh rosemary than you 
  need.</li>
