A remarkably flavorful sweet-sour treatment for zucchini. One of the best 
zucchini recipes I know. It can serve as a star side dish, or as a light 
vegetarian main course, but see <a href="fsv_zuconion1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil. Toss in the <b>ONIONS</b> for 
    just 1 minute, stirring them around, then quench in cold water. This 
    will make them easy to peel. Trim off just the tip of the stem end and 
    peel the papery layers back. Cut the minimum from the root end so they 
    don't come apart in cooking.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ZUCCHINIS</b> depending on size. You want sticks between 1-1/2
    and 2 inches long and fairly narrow (see <a href="fsv_zuconion1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FIGS</b> into very small dice. Toss them in a pot of warm water 
    for about 10 minutes, then drain.</li>
  <li>Carve the skin and white rind from the <b>LEMON</b>. Break it apart 
    and separate the pulp from the membranes. Discard membranes and seeds 
    and chop the pulp fairly small. Add to the Figs.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>MINT</b> and <b>CILANTRO</b> small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>CARDAMOM</b> pods (green or white) lightly to crack open and 
    strip out the seeds, discarding the husks. Break tops off <b>Chilis</b> 
    and shake out the seeds. Discard seeds and add Chilis to the Cardamom.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, place <b>Onions</b> and all <b>Sauce 
    items</b>. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. stirring 
    now and then.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Zucchini</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Bring back to a boil 
    and simmer covered over low flame about 4 minutes, turning frequently. 
    You want the Zucchini to still have some crispness and the seeds to 
    stay attached to the sticks.</li>
  <li>Stir in 2 T <b>Olive Oil</b>, make sure there is enough water and 
    bring to a high boil for about 1 minute uncovered to blend the oil 
    with the sauce.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Figs</b> and <b>Lemon</b> and take off the heat.</li> 
  <li>When ready to serve, pull out bay leaves and chilis and stir in 
    <b>Mint mix</b>. 
  <li>If serving as a side, it's best to use shallow bowls so each serving 
    can have some sauce. If serving as a light main dish, accompany with 
    some steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Onions</h3> &nbsp; The original recipe calls for "pearl onions", 
  but those are scarce and ridiculously expensive around here, and a 
  real hassle to peel. I pick through the bin of boiling onions at a 
  local produce market for the smallest ones.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Zucchini</h3> &nbsp; Buy the smallest Zucchini you can get. For 
  the photo I actually used Mediterranean squash (lighter color, 
  slightly milder flavor), 5 inches long and 1-7/8 inches diameter. 
  I cut lengthwise into 8 wedges, then cut the wedges in half crosswise.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Japones chilis are small and 
  not very hot and give this dish a just noticeable bite. OK, I actually 
  used a pare of de Arobols for a little more bite. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for twice as 
  much figs and lemon - it was almost inedible. With the amount given 
  here, this recipe is excellent.</li>
