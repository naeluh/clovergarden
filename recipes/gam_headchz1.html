It's disrespectful to a pig to call certain parts "disgusting" and discard 
them when they are perfectly fine to eat if properly prepared. This antique 
French recipe for Head Cheese is a good example.

The photo specimen is darker and less pink than commercial products, 
because it has more meat in it and was made without Saltpeter, which 
preserves the meat color.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 days - 2 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash the <b>PIG Head</b>. Scoop out the brain with a spoon and 
    discard it (<a href="gam_headchz1.html#02">Note-2</a>).</li>
  <li>Remove the flesh and skin from the head bones. Just start working 
    from the edges with a razor sharp boning knife. Work around until 
    you have it all off, then take also all the tongue. 
    (<a href="gam_headchz1.html#03">Note-3</a>). You should end up with something near 
    3 pounds.</li>
  <li>Remove the skin from the fresh hocks and all the meat from the 
    bones. You should have about 1 pound of meat and about 1/2 pound of 
    skin. Toss skin and meat in with the pig head. Use the bones to make 
    soup stock.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>PEPPER</b> and <b>ALLSPICE</b>, crumble <b>BAY LEAVES</b>, 
    strip leaves from <b>THYME</b> stems. Mix all with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Saltpeter</b> (if used).</li>
  <li>Work the <b>Salt Mix</b> thoroughly into all sides of the 
    <b>Pig Head</b> and other meat and skin parts. Pack into a 
    non-reactive (glass, ceramic or stainless) bowl, cover tightly and 
    store in the refrigerator for a week (<a href="gam_headchz1.html#07">Note-7</a>). I 
    generally pull it out, turn and repack a couple times during the 
    week to make sure everything is well distributed.</li>
  <li>After a week of curing in the fridge, rinse all the pieces in cold 
    water and put them into a pot.</li>
  <li>Peel the <b>ONION</b>, cut in half crosswise and stick each half 
    with a <b>Clove</b>, cut <b>CELERY</b>  into 1 inch lengths and 
    <b>CARROT</b> into 1/2 inch lengths. Put all <b>Cooking items</b> 
    in the pot with the <b>Pig Meat/Skin</b> and add water to just cover. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer very slowly until all pieces of meat 
    pierce easily, 1-1/2 hours should be about right.</li>
  <li>Pull all the <b>meat/skin</b> from the pot, cool and cut into 
    fairly large pieces, about 3/4 inch by 2 inches long and 1/2 inch 
    thick. Cut <b>ears</b> into strips about 1/8 inch wide by about 2 
    inches long.</li>
  <li>Boil the broth down by about 1/2. Strain it and de-fat it (use your 
    gravy separator).</li>
  <li>Pack the <b>Meat/Skin</b> chunks into molds shaped so the head 
    cheese can be unmolded easily. Pack only medium tight, then pour in 
    enough of the broth to just cover the meat. Let cool and refrigerate 
    until well chilled and jelled.</li>
  <li>To unmold, partially fill a bowl with hot water, set the mold in it 
    just long enough to free the cheese, then unmold onto a plate and 
    refrigerate to re-chill.</li>
  <li>If you haven't eaten it all within a week, melt it down over very low 
    heat, simmer slowly for 10 minutes, remold and refrigerate.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Head:</h3> &nbsp; in Southern California pig 
  heads are generally sold sawed into left and right halves with the 
  ears, eyelids and some of the lip cut away. Replacement ears are 
  available at Philippine and other Asian markets - they add a crunchy 
  texture. Heads are actually hard to get here, but you can use snouts, 
  tongues, ears an other parts easily available in Asian markets. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_pigc.html#other">Pig / Pork Cuts 
  by Chart</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Brain:</h3> &nbsp; The brain is mushy but small, about the size of 
  1/2 lemon split lengthwise. A waste to discard it, yes, but there have 
  been cases of nerve damage from pig brains in processing plants - and 
  if I were a pig I'm not sure I'd want anyone eating my brain anyway, 
  it's kind of a personal part. Of course if you're a brain-hungry 
  zombie with spoon in hand - go for it!</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Boning:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally you'd start with 
  a whole head with ears on and remove all the skin and flesh in one piece 
  so the head cheese could be made wrapped up in the skin. Generally the 
  butcher shop would perform this work. With a half head this isn't a 
  practical method. One major reason for using the wrap method is the 
  cheese would keep longer, a week even - but we have refrigeration now.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Meat & Skin:</h3> &nbsp; Meat that has a lot of connective tissue 
  so it cooks up moist and contributes gel to the broth is preferred - 
  neck and hock are considered good. Fresh hocks are easily available 
  and come with skin on them too so you get two ingredients in one tray 
  - with neck you'd have to buy some extra skin (available in meat 
  markets serving a Mexican community). Some people toss in a pig 
  foot instead.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp;  Kosher salt is preferred but 
  regular table salt will do. 3-1/2 ounces is just over 1/3 cup Morton 
  Kosher, just over 1/2 cup for Diamond Crystal, or just over 1/4 cup 
  regular table salt.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Saltpeter:</h3> &nbsp; Including this will make 
  a cheese pinker and more like commercial products, and is also a strong 
  anti bacterial. This can be Potassium Nitrate or Sodium Nitrate - or you 
  can replace all the salt with 1/4 cup Prague Powder #1 (Instacure #1). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html">Curing Salts</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Salt Cure:</h3> &nbsp;  Antique recipes say to 
  cure four or five days in a "cool place". We don't have places like 
  that in July in Southern California so I suggest a longer time in the 
  fridge.</li>
