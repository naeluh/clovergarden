Pig ears are enjoyed prepared in various ways, pickling being one - they 
aren't just for doggy chews. Ears have a uniquely enjoyable texture due 
to their thin crunchy cartilaginous core coated by a thick layer of skin 
on both sides. Of course they must be pickled properly, as this recipe 
will do.

  <li>Prepare a jar of sufficient size to hold the Ears. A 2 quart (8 
    cup) jar is just right for 3 pounds of ears. It should be as sterile as 
    possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting cleanser like 
    Comet or a rinse with bleach solution will do fine).</li>
  <li>Clean <b>PIG EARS</b>. At this point I usually cut off the thick root 
    end so the ears pack better in the pot. Yes, the thick ends go in too.
    </li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Cure</b> in a large stainless steel pot and add the 
    <b>Pig Ears</b>. Yes that's a lot of cure, but the pig ears are likely 
    to be unruly and take a lot of room. Over high heat, bring to a boil for 
    just a moment, then hold at 210&deg;F/99&deg;C, or a bare simmer for about 
    5 minutes. Take the pot off the heat and let it stand tightly covered 
    in a cool place for 12 hours.</li>
  <li>Bring the pot to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C and hold it there for half an 
    hour to 45 minutes. Start sampling the ears early to make sure you don't 
    overcook them - Hey! Stop eating them. The skin layer should remain a 
    little chewy.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Ears</b> and let cool enough to handle them. Slice them into 
    strips a little less than 1/2 inch wide (including those thick ends).</li>
  <li>Place <b>Ears</b> back in the pot. Pack them down, then pour in 
    enough <b>Vinegar</b> to just about cover. Remove the <b>Ears</b> again 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the <b>Vinegar</b>, 
    then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Ears</b> back in and bring to a full boil over high 
    heat. Immediately turn off heat and scoop the Ears out into the sterile 
    jar. Pour the pickle vinegar over to cover. You can strain it or not, as 
    you wish. At this point I usually cool them down rapidly by immersing 
    the jar in cold water. If you have extra pickling vinegar save it in a 
    separate jar for topping off as you remove ears from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jar tightly and let sit in a cool place for about 3 days   
    before you start eating them (yeah, sure, like you're going to be able 
    to do that).</li>
  <li>When serving, rinse pieces in warm water to reduce acidity.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pig Ears:</b> &nbsp; I hear pig ears are fairly 
  common in the Chicago region, but not in most of the rest of the 
  country - except in Asian markets. I find them most plentiful in 
  Philippine markets, but they also appear in markets serving an East or 
  Southeast Asian community. Scratch the skin. If you can scratch the 
  skin off the cartilage the ears are spoiled and should be discarded - 
  the skin should be rather tough and scratch resistant.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Saltpeter:</b> &nbsp; This may be Potassium or 
  Sodium Nitrate - I use Potassium Nitrate. The action of this chemical 
  greatly improves color, texture and taste, as well as suppressing 
  bacterial growth. For details and pros and cons see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html">Curing Salts</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at 
  a Restaurant Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the supermarket 
  where it's 5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White Vinegar, or you 
  can use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and apple juice) sold in 
  gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in quarts or smaller).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 4 Japones will not make the 
  skins very hot at all. 4 dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. 
  De Arbols are in between, so use your own best judgement. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The Salt and Potassium Nitrate 
  cure has some advantages over pickling without nitrate. The meat retains 
  a better color, and the gelatin doesn't migrate into the pickle liquid and 
  jell it up solid. The flavor is also better. No, the saltpeter won't cause 
  your pecker to go flat, that's an old boarding school myth, but English 
  gin will do that. Potassium Nitrate is easy to order on the Internet. In 
  my childhood we could get it cheaply from the local drug store, but I'm 
  not sure that is still possible.</li>
