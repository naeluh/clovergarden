even better than the deli and Mexican brands. See also <a href="gam_pigftpkl1.html#04">

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - about 2 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare jars sufficient to hold the feet. They should be as sterile 
     as possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting cleanser 
     like Comet or an even stronger "institutional" version seems to do 
     fine).</li>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> well to remove all bone particles. Put them into 
    a large pot and cover with water by about 2 inches or more as they'll 
    swell a bit. An 8-quart pot is sufficient for 6 pounds. Bring the pot to 
    a boil over high heat  for a few minutes, then dump it all out in the 
    sink and rinse the crud off the feet.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and put the <b>Pig Feet</b> back in with water to cover. 
    Bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer covered until tender but 
    not overdone. That should be about 1-3/4 hours (some recipes call for 
    cooking far too long). Sample to see when you have the desired consistency 
    it should be possible to pull out the large bones, but not too easily. A 
    little more cooking is good for edibility but bad for appearance.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Pig Feet</b>. Rinse any scum off them and remove any 
    bones that are loose and not serving any purpose.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the <b>Pig Feet</b>. Pack them down, then 
    pour in enough <b>VINEGAR</b> to just about cover. Remove the 
    <b>Pig Feet</b> again and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the <b>Vinegar</b>, 
    then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Pig Feet</b> back in and bring to a full boil. Turn off 
    heat and with tongs, transfer the Feet into the sterile jars. Pour the 
    pickle vinegar over to cover. You can strain it or not, as you wish. If 
    you have extra pickling vinegar save it in a separate jar for topping 
    off as you remove pig's feet from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jars tightly and let sit in a cool place for 3 days or more  
    before you start eating them (yeah, sure, like you're going to be able 
    to do that).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pig Feet:</b> &nbsp; Buy your pigs feet split in half 
  lengthwise (band sawed, actually), then crosswise into halves. Packing 
  full length feet is more difficult, and you may not always want to eat 
  a whole one all at once.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at a Restaurant 
  Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the supermarket where it's 
  5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White Vinegar, or you 
  can use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and apple juice) sold in 
  gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in quarts or smaller).</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 6 Japones will not make the feet very hot. 6 
  dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. De Arbols are in 
  between. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
  <b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; This uncured method is quick, 
  simple and flavorful. Disadvantages are that the color is darker and gelatin 
  tends to migrate into the pickle liquid, diluting it and making the feet 
  difficult to remove from the jar after a while. Figure on eating them 
  fairly soon. Our alternate recipe, 
  <a href="gam_pigftpkl2.html"><b>Pickled Pig Feet #2</b></a> cures 
  overnight with salt and a little potassium nitrate (saltpeter) making 
  them more like the commercial product, but still with good flavor.</li>
