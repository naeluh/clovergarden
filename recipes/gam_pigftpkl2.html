  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - about 2 hrs work)
  <br>This recipe fits in two 1/2 gallon kimchee jars.
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare jars sufficient to hold the feet. They should be as sterile as 
    possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting cleanser like 
    Comet or an even stronger "institutional" version seems to do fine).</li>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> well to remove all bone particles.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Cure</b> in a large pot, then add the <b>Pig Feet</b> Bring 
    the pot to just short of a boil (210&deg;F/99&deg;C). Hold it there for 
    a few minutes so the feet are warmed through (if it boils you'll have to 
    deal with the scum).</li>
  <li> Set aside, tightly covered, for 12 hours or a bit more.</li>
  <li>Bring up to around 180&deg;F/82&deg;C and hold there until feet 
    are cooked to the right state (see <a href="gam_pigftpkl2.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>). 
    At this low temperature that will take as much as 3 hours. They are 
    done when the large bones could be pulled out, but not too easily.
    </li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Pig Feet</b>. Rinse any scum off them and remove any 
    bones that are loose and not serving any purpose.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the <b>Pig Feet</b>. Pack them down, then 
    pour in enough <b>VINEGAR</b> to just cover. Remove the 
    <b>Pig Feet</b> again and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the <b>Vinegar</b>, 
    then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Pig Feet</b> back in and bring to a full boil. Turn off 
    heat and with tongs, transfer the Feet into the sterile jars. Pour the 
    pickle vinegar over to cover. You can strain it or not, as you wish. If 
    you have extra pickling vinegar save it in a separate jar for topping 
    off as you remove pig's feet from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jars tightly and let sit in a cool place for 3 days or more  
    before you start eating them (yeah, sure, like you're going to be able 
    to do that).</li>
  <li>When serving, rinse in warm water to reduce acidity.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pig Feet:</b> &nbsp; Buy your pigs feet split in half 
  lengthwise (band sawed, actually), then crosswise into halves. Packing 
  full length feet is more difficult, and you may not always want to eat 
  a whole one all at once.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Saltpeter:</b> &nbsp; This may be Potassium or 
  Sodium Nitrate - I use Potassium Nitrate. The action of this chemical 
  greatly improves the color and texture, as well as supressing bacterial 
  growth. For details and pros and cons see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html"><b>Curing Salts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at 
  a Restaurant Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the supermarket 
  where it's 5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White Vinegar, or you 
  can use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and apple juice) sold in 
  gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in quarts or smaller).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 6 Japones will not make the feet 
  very hot. 6 dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. De Arbols are 
  in between. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The Salt and Potassium Nitrate cure has some 
  advantages over pickling without it. The meat retains a better 
  color, and the gelatin doesn't migrate into the pickle liquid so much. 
  Without the cure the pickle will become gelled solid after a while. No, 
  the saltpeter won't cause your pecker to go flat, that's an old boarding 
  school myth, but English gin will do that. Potassium Nitrate is easy to 
  order on the Internet. In my childhood we could get it cheaply from the 
  local drug store, but that isn't still possible.</li>
<li id="06"><b>Method</b> &nbsp; After bringing this recipe up 
  to 185&deg;F/85&deg;C I pour it into a large Slow Cooker where I will 
  have good control. Unfortunately, my big slow cooker is 205&deg;F on 
  "Low" and around 170&deg;F on "Keep Warm" So I turn it back and forth, 
  though I'm sure 205&deg; would do no harm.</li>
