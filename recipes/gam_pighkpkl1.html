Back in my early working days, any self respecting bar had a big jar of 
pickled eggs and another of pickled pork hocks. Hocks are quite different 
from Pig Feet so the pickling procedure is also substantially different.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - about 2 hours work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare jars sufficient to hold the hocks. They should be as 
    sterile as possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting 
    cleanser like Comet or an even stronger "institutional" version seems 
    to do fine).</li>
  <li>Wash <b>HOCKS</b> well to remove all bone particles. Put them in 
    a large pot with plenty of water to cover (they will twist, taking 
    up a lot more room). Bring to a boil for two minutes. Pour out into 
    a clean sink and rinse. Wash the pot.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Cure</b> in the large pot, then add the <b>Hocks</b> 
    Bring the pot to just short of a boil (208&deg;F/98&deg;C, a bit 
    lower at higher altitudes). Hold it there for a 5 minutes so the 
    hocks are warmed through.</li>
  <li> Set aside, tightly covered, for 12 hours or a bit more.</li>
  <li>Bring up to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C and hold between 180&deg;F and 
    190&deg;F until hocks are cooked to the right state. At this low 
    temperature that will take around 1 to 1-1/4 hour, depending on 
    thickness. They should still seem a little undercooked with he skins 
    a bit chewy.</li>
  <li>Drain the hocks, discarding the cooking liquid.</li> 
  <li>Clean the pot and return the <b>Hocks</b>. Pack them down, then 
    pour in enough <b>Vinegar</b> to just about cover. Remove the 
    <b>Hocks</b> again and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the 
    <b>Vinegar</b>, then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain the pickle liquid and return to a boil. Put the <b>Hocks</b> 
    back in and bring up to 180 &deg;F/82&deg;C, then turn off the heat. 
    <u>CAUTION:</u> if the liquid exceeds about 190&deg;F the hocks will 
    fall apart completely.</li>
  <li>With tongs, transfer the Hocks into the sterile jars. Pour the 
    pickle vinegar over to cover. If you have extra pickling vinegar 
    save it in a separate jar for topping off as you remove hocks feet 
    from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jars tightly and let sit in a cool place for 3 days or more  
    before you start eating them.</li>
  <li>When serving, rinse the pieces in warm water to reduce the acidity.
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pork Hocks:</b> &nbsp; Buy your hocks bandsawed into slices, 
  preferably about 3/4 inch thick. Those used for the photo were from 
  an Philippine market in Los Angeles (Eagle Rock). They were a bit 
  larger than I would have liked, and a bit thinner, but they were the 
  best hocks available at the time (their thick ones were waaaay too big.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Saltpeter:</b> &nbsp; This may be Potassium or Sodium Nitrate - I 
  use Potassium Nitrate. The action of this chemical greatly improves 
  the color and texture, as well as suppressing bacterial growth. For 
  details and pros and cons see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html"><b>Curing Salts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at a Restaurant 
  Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the supermarket where it's 
  5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White Vinegar, or you can 
  use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and apple juice) sold in 
  gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in quarts or smaller).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 6 Japones will not make the feet 
  very hot. 6 dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. De Arbols 
  are in between. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The Salt and Potassium Nitrate 
  cure has significant advantages over pickling without it. The meat 
  retains a better color, and the gelatin doesn't migrate into the pickle 
  liquid so much. Without the cure the pickle will become gelled solid 
  after a while. No, the saltpeter won't cause your pecker to go flat, 
  that's an old boarding school myth, but English gin will do that. 
  Potassium Nitrate is easy to order on the Internet. In my childhood 
  we could get it cheaply from the local drug store, but I'm not sure 
  that is still possible - it can be used to make explosives.</li>
