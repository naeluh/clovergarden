Super Bacon - pork ribs with bacon layer and rind all intact. It's bacon 
cured, smoked and oven roasted - as stunningly delicious as you'd expect.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 475&deg;F/245&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Score <b>PORK RIBS</b> skin side diagonally in both directions just 
    through the skin. You need a very sharp knife for this because the skin 
    is tough.</li>
  <li>Rub <b>Olive Oil</b> onto the skin side.</li>
  <li>Set the <b>Pork Ribs</b> skin side up on a roasting rack placed in a 
    roasting pan. Slide into the oven and roast for about 10 minutes to 
    start the skin crisping.</li>
  <li>Turn the heat down to 300&deg;F/150&deg;C. Carefully pour 1 or 2 cups 
    of water into the pan (depending on pan size). Continue to roast for 
    another 1-1/2 hours. By this time much of fat will be rendered out and 
    the meat should be reasonably tender.</li>
  <li>Slice, cut slices into strips and serve. You'll have to slice along 
    the score lines because the crispy skin is too hard to cut through 
    without breaking up the  rest. This recipe is best served warm, but 
    it's still plenty good at a warm room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Smoked Pork Ribs:</b> &nbsp; This is a deli item, at 
  least here in Los Angeles. Full length strips are cut from the spare rib 
  area of the pork belly, ribs, bacon layer and skin intact. These strips 
  are given a bacon cure, then hung up and smoked well. Photo on "Enlarged" 
  page.</li>
