Compared to other pig parts, pickling skins is pretty tricky, and 
definitely requires potassium nitrate (saltpeter) or the jar will gel 
solid. The worst sin you can commit is overcooking - even a little 
overcooked they are Yuk!

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - about 2 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare a jar of sufficient size to hold the skins. A 1-1/2 quart 
    (6 cup) jar is just right for 2 pounds of skins. It should be as 
    sterile as possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting 
    cleanser like Comet or a rinse with bleach solution will do fine).
    </li>
  <li>Check <b>PIG SKINS</b> for excess fat, particularly at the edges 
    and cut it away. Cut the skins into pieces about 1-1/4 by 2-1/4 
    inches. This takes a sharp, strong knife and some effort - there's 
    a reason they made footballs out of pig skin.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Cure</b> in a large pot and bring it up to a simmer (yes 
    that's a lot of cure, but the skins tend to curl and take a lot of 
    space). Stir in the <b>Pig Skins</b> and, over high heat, bring back 
    to 210&deg;F/99&deg;C, in other words, just short of a boil. Take  
    the pot off the heat and let it stand tightly covered in a cool place 
    for 12 hours.</li>
  <li>Bring the pot to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C quickly. Immediately drain the 
    skins and let cool.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the <b>Pig Skins</b>. Pack them down, then 
    pour in enough <b>Vinegar</b> to just about cover. Remove the 
    <b>Pig Skins</b> again and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the 
    <b>Vinegar</b>, then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Pig Skins</b> back in and bring to a full boil over high 
    heat. Immediately turn off heat and scoop the Skins out into a clean 
    bowl. With tongs, transfer the Skins into the sterile jar. Pour the 
    pickle vinegar over to cover. You can strain it or not, as you wish. 
    If you have extra pickling vinegar save it in a separate jar for 
    topping off as you remove skins from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jar tightly and let sit in a cool place for about 3 days   
    before you start eating them (yeah, sure, like you're going to be able 
    to do that).</li>
  <li>When serving rinse the pieces in warm water to cut down the 
    acidity.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pig Skins:</b> &nbsp; Rolls of pig skins are easily found in meat 
  markets serving a significant Mexican community. For this use, thicker 
  hides are better, and they should have the fat removed pretty 
  thoroughly (pork processors have a special machine for that - it's not 
  easy to do by hand).</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Saltpeter:</b> &nbsp; This may be Potassium or 
  Sodium Nitrate - I use Potassium Nitrate. The action of this chemical 
  greatly improves color, texture and taste, as well as suppressing 
  bacterial growth. For details and pros and cons see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html"><b>Curing Salts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03"><b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at 
  a Restaurant Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the 
  supermarket where it's 5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White 
  Vinegar, or you can use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and 
  apple juice) sold in gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in 
  quarts or smaller).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 4 Japones will not make the 
  skins very hot. 4 dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. De 
  Arbols are in between, so use your own best judgement. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The Salt and Potassium Nitrate 
  cure has some advantages over pickling without nitrate. The meat 
  retains a better color, and the gelatin doesn't migrate into the pickle 
  liquid and jell it up solid. The flavor is also better. No, the 
  saltpeter won't cause your pecker to go flat, that's an old boarding 
  school myth, but English gin will do that. Potassium Nitrate is easy 
  to order on the Internet. In my childhood we could get it cheaply from 
  the local drug store, but I doubt that is still possible.</li>
