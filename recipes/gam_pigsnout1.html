In pig raising parts of the country these are put up in big jars with 
their noses pressed to the glass. They are trickier to pickle than pig 
feet, much easier to overcook, but not nearly as tricky as pig skins.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - about 2 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare a jar of sufficient size to hold the snouts. A 2 quart 
    (8 cup) jar is just right for 3 pounds of snouts. It should be as 
    sterile as possible (a thorough cleaning with a strong disinfecting 
    cleanser like Comet or a rinse with bleach solution will do fine).
    </li>
  <li>Check <b>PIG SNOUTS</b> for excess fat and cut it away, but don't 
    get too carried away. Cut into large pieces as desired, particularly 
    if you got whole faces.</li>
  <li>Mix the <b>Cure</b> in a large pot. Add the <b>Snouts</b> and, over 
    high heat, bring it up to 210&deg;F/99&deg;C, in other words, just 
    short of a boil. Take  the pot off the heat and let it stand tightly 
    covered in a cool place for 12 hours.</li>
  <li>Bring the pot to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C quickly. Hold at that 
    temperature for 15 minutes, <u>no</u> <u>more</u>. Immediately drain 
    the snouts and let cool.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot and return the <b>Snouts</b>. Pack them down, then 
    pour in enough <b>Vinegar</b> to just about cover. Remove the 
    <b>Snouts</b> again and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into lengthwise wedges and stir into the 
    <b>Vinegar</b>, then stir in all <b>Spices</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer covered for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Snouts</b> back in and bring to a full boil over high 
    heat. Immediately turn off heat and scoop the Snouts out into a clean 
    bowl. With tongs, transfer the Snouts into the sterile jar. Pour the 
    pickle vinegar over to cover. You can strain it or not, as you wish. 
    If you have extra pickling vinegar save it in a separate jar for 
    topping off as you remove snouts from the jar.</li>
  <li>Cover jar tightly and let sit in a cool place for about 3 days   
    before you start eating them (yeah, sure, like you're going to be able 
    to do that).</li>
  <li>When serving, rinse pieces with warm water to reduce acidity.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Pig Snouts:</b> &nbsp; Here in Los Angeles, every Asian meat market 
  has plenty of pig snouts for sale. In most you get a tray with several 
  snouts, but in the local Philippine market you get one snout with the 
  rest of the pig's face folded under it with eye holes cut out. Both 
  ways are good.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Saltpeter:</b> &nbsp; This may be Potassium or 
  Sodium Nitrate - I use Potassium Nitrate. The action of this chemical 
  greatly improves color, texture and taste, as well as suppressing 
  bacterial growth. For details and pros and cons see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_saltptz.html"><b>Curing Salts</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Buy lots of vinegar. Get it at 
  a Restaurant Supply where it's under $1.50/gallon, not at the 
  supermarket where it's 5 times that or more. Generally, Distilled White 
  Vinegar, or you can use the fake Cider Vinegar (white vinegar and apple 
  juice) sold in gallon jugs (real Cider Vinegar comes only in quarts or 
  smaller).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; 4 Japones will not make the 
  snouts very hot. 4 dried Thai chilis are a different matter though. De 
  Arbols are in between, so use your own best judgement. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Method:</b> &nbsp; The Salt and Potassium Nitrate cure has some 
  advantages over pickling without nitrate. The meat retains a better 
  color, and the gelatin doesn't migrate into the pickle liquid and gell 
  it up solid. The flavor is also better. No, the saltpeter won't cause 
  your pecker to go flat, that's an old boarding school myth, but 
  English gin will do that. Potassium Nitrate is easy to order on the 
  Internet. In my childhood we could get it cheaply from the local drug 
  store, but that's not still possible.</li>
