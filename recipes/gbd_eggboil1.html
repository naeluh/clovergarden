Two minute eggs and soft boiled eggs may be served in individual egg cups 
for breakfast, but for many other uses, from salads to garnishes, hard 
boiled eggs are needed. This method, incorporating current "best 
practices", will make any of those.

<h3>Egg Spoon</h3>
<p>This is the ideal utensil for removing eggs 
from hot water - it holds the egg but the hot water all escapes. I also 
find it very useful for transferring tomatoes from the scalding water 
to the cold quench water for peeling.	 For details see our 
<a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html"><b>Egg Piercer / Spoon / Slicer</b></a> 
page.

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<p>Hard cooked eggs should be just cooked through and not overcooked or 
the yolks become discolored and texture becomes less appetizing. 
There are many ways recommended in many books and on many Web pages as 
to how to accomplish this, but much of it is bunk. The method given here 
follows the latest research and actual comparative testing.</p>
<p>Note: &nbsp; Many sources recommend buying eggs you will hard cook 
a week in advance and keep them well refrigerated. This is said to make 
them easier to peel. My experience says otherwise.  I've had older eggs 
that just wouldn't peel, and very fresh eggs that peeled wonderfully. 
My experience has recently been confirmed by actually testing by 
J. Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt. Some hens lay peelable eggs and some just 
don't know how (peelability is probably not a high priority for a 
chicken). If you're going to do a big batch, test before need. If they 
just won't peel, try a batch from a different farm. Free range eggs 
are reportedly the most difficult to peel.<p>
<p>This method will maximize the peelability of hard cooked eggs</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Piercing?</b> &nbsp; Optional: you may want to use an egg 
    piercer or a large sewing needle to puncture the round end of the 
    egg where the air sack is. This hole need not be visible to be 
    effective. This does not materially affect peelability, but does 
    help keep eggs with invisible cracks from bursting.</li>
  <li><b>Prepare:</b> &nbsp; Have your cooking pan (I usually use a 
    large saut&eacute; pan when doing a lot of eggs) ready with plenty 
    of cold water in it. <b><u>Do Not</u></b> add salt, vinegar, baking 
    powder / soda or any other substance you may have heard recommended. 
    Preferably the pan should be large enough for all the eggs in one 
    layer, with 1/2 inch of water above the eggs. You can probably get 
    away with two layers with 1 inch above the eggs.</li>
  <li><b>Pretreat:</b> &nbsp; This greatly improves peelability. Bring 
    a small but deep saucepan to a rolling boil. With an egg spoon, 
    lower eggs, two or three at a time into the boiling water. Let them 
    stay for about 30 seconds, then remove them into the waiting cold 
    water in your cooking pan.</li>
  <li><b>Cooking:</b> &nbsp; On high heat, bring the cooking pan to a 
    rolling boil. As soon as it is boiling well, turn off the heat. 
    Leave covered and let stand for 15 minutes - it should still 
    be around 188&deg;F/88&deg;C. The eggs will be perfectly cooked 
    through and the outside of the yolks will have none of that 
    gray-green color. &nbsp; <b>Note:</b> &nbsp; you can do 2 minute 
    and soft boiled eggs by this method - just pull the eggs sooner. 
    The exact timing may vary a bit depending on your pan, amount of 
    water and size of your eggs - you'll just have to experiment.</li>
  <li><b>Peeling:</b> &nbsp; I've read much advice on peeling eggs, and 
    most of it doesn't work at all. Some say the eggs must be cold, but 
    the eggs I get tend to be totally unpeelable cold. Here's what 
    works for me.
    <ol>
      <li>Pull an egg from the hot water (easiest using a wooden egg 
        spoon).</li>
      <li>Give the egg a quick dash under cool running water so you can 
        handle it.</li>
      <li>Crack the shell lightly on a hard flat surface in several 
        places, just hard enough to break the membrane under the shell. 
        <u>Caution:</u> strike or massage gently, because if you are 
        rough enough to separate the outer two layers of egg, peeling 
        is hopeless.</li>
      <li>Many say to peel under cold running water, but I get the best 
        results peeling the egg as hot as I can handle it.</li>
      <li>If the water the remaining eggs are in drops down below 
        150&deg;F/66&deg;C, I start having trouble peeling, so I put the 
        pan back on the stove and bring it back up to 180&deg;F/82&deg;C.
        </li>
        </ol>
  <li><b>Cooling:</b> &nbsp; If you want your peeled eggs uniformly 
    round with no flat spots, cool them floating in cold water.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Egg Slicer</h3>
<p>Slicing eggs with a knife is an exercise in frustration. The eggs 
stick to the sides of the knife, the yolks smear and crumble, and the 
whites break. The wires of the Egg Slicer have no sides to stick to. 
It cuts eggs into slices or wedges without difficulty or mess. For 
details see our
