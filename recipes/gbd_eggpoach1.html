Poached eggs lend themselves to many elegant and flavorful dishes, and 
many of them are easy to make.  They are suited in particular to intimate 
breakfasts for two, but they can be made ahead so are suitable also for 
larger gatherings.

<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Eggs:</b> &nbsp; Be aware that some chickens just don't know how to 
  lay a poachable egg. Before doing anything important test an egg from the 
  batch. If it makes a mess in the pan, get another batch from a different 
  farm.</li>
<li><b>Fresh:</b> &nbsp; Eggs for poaching must be as fresh as you can get 
  them. Older eggs have runny whites which will make sloppy looking poached 
  eggs.</li>
<li><b>Timing</b> for poaching eggs is very critical. The trickiest part is 
  learning exactly when to pull the eggs, because the surest way to ruin 
  them is to overcook them. The yolks must be skinned over but still very 
  liquid inside, both for flavor and to act as a sauce for the whites.</li>
<li><b>Learn</b> to judge doneness by poking the whites near the 
  yolk with a chopstick and noting how they jiggle. With a little practice 
  you can get them right every time.</li>
<li><b>Holding:</b> &nbsp; Once eggs are poached they can be held in warm 
  water until you have them all ready - or - in cold water and refrigerated 
  overnight.</li>
<li><b>Preferences:</b> &nbsp; Some people insist on their eggs being 
  overcooked, not because they like the flavor but out of squeamishness. 
  Serve them scrambled eggs and bitch about having to overcook them.</li>
<li><b>The French Method:</b> &nbsp; Some gourmet cookbooks describe the 
  "French method" for poaching eggs, supposedly used by the great chefs. 
  You swirl hot water into a whirlpool, then carefully unload the egg into 
  the eye of the whirlpool where it will be "pocketed" until done. This is 
  <u>a cruel joke</u> designed to convince yuppies and "purists" that 
  poaching eggs is nearly impossible.  Even if this method worked, which 
  it most certainly does not, you could only poach one egg at a time. 
  The so called "American" method is the only method mentioned by 
  Escoffier, beyond whom only Car&ecirc;me is greater.</li>
<li><b>Devices:</b> &nbsp; Many poaching aids are sold to contain eggs as 
  they poach. Some work, some don't, but most produce a very "industrial" 
  looking egg. I use no devices and recommend none.</li>
<li><b>Sauces</b> can often be made the day before.</li>
<li><b>Health Note:</b> Poached eggs fall under the USDA heading of 
  "undercooked eggs". which may carry salmonella. This is a controversial 
  subject, particularly since salmonella problems seem all to be 
  institutionally related. For full details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html#health"><b>Eggs</b></a> page.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Equipment you will need</h3>
<ol>
<li>A saut&eacute; pan or similar about 2-1/2" deep and about 10" across.
  </li>
<li>A saucepan or similar of sufficient size to hold all the eggs you 
  intend to poach floating in warm water without excessive crowding. This 
  is not necessary if you intend only a few eggs to be served immediately 
  they are done.</li>
<li>A slotted spoon of large size, say 3 inches or more across, for 
  lifting the eggs out of the pan when they are done.</li>
<li>A couple of very small dishes or shallow cups with which to get the 
  eggs into the hot water with minimum disturbance.</li>
<li>A wooden spatula with which to move eggs around in the pan.</li>
<li>A chopstick or similar device for poking the egg whites to judge 
  doneness.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put about 1-1/2 inch of water in your pan and add 1/4 cup vinegar to 
  help set the whites.</li>
<li><b>IF</b> you will be holding the eggs warm, fill a saucepan with 
  enough water to float them all without crowding and bring it up hot 
  enough so you can only hold your fingers in it for a few seconds - 
  <u>but not hotter</u> or it may set the yolks and the eggs will be 
  ruined.</li>
<li><b>IF</b> you will be holding the eggs for a long time, like overnight, 
  use a pan of ice cold water instead of warm water.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the shallow cups or dishes disturbing them as little 
  as possible as you do.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat under the simmering water and wait for it to be 
  completely still.</li>
<li>Lower the cups into the water, tip them and slide them out from under 
  the eggs disturbing the water and eggs as little as possible.</li>
<li>Turn the heat back on, but not too high, you don't want to get the water 
  rolling. You can push the eggs around a bit with a wooden spatula to make 
  sure they don't stick and circulate the water around so it's evenly hot.</li>
<li>Poke the whites right near the yolk with a chopstick to see if they are 
  set - you need a little practice to learn to tell.</li>
<li>When eggs are properly done, use the slotted spoon to lift them out, 
  either onto a prepared serving dish or into the saucepan of water if you 
  will be holding them in.</li>
<li>When ready to use eggs you have been holding, lift each egg out with a 
  slotted spoon and let it drain well before placing it in it's final 
  position.</li>
<li><b>IF</b> you have held the eggs in cold water, heat a pan with plenty 
  of water in it almost to a boil. Turn off the heat and lower the eggs 
  in as quickly as you can. Let them sit there with the heat off for 10 
  to 15 minutes until they are warmed through.</li>
