An easy breakfast that's been well liked for centuries, and a good way 
to use up yesterday's bread. French Toast is not at all specific to 
France (see <a href="gbd_frogtoast1.html#03"><b>History</b></a>).

  <ol>
  <li>Beat together <b>Eggs</b> and <b>Salt</b>, then beat in 
    <b>Milk</b>. Pour out into a shallow dish that will easily fit the 
    bread slices.</li>
  <li>Heat a thin coating of <b>Butter</b> in a skillet or griddle over 
    medium-low heat.</li>
  <li>One at a time place <b>Bread Slices</b> in the <b>Egg mix</b> and 
    let soak for about 2 seconds, then turn over for a second or so more. 
    Do only as many as you will fry at one time and get them in the 
    skillet quickly. You can pass them directly to the pan or hold them 
    on a plate for a couple minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer to the skillet and fry slowly over rather low heat until 
    lightly browned on one side, then turn and do the other side.</li>
  <li>Some recipes sprinkle the finished toast with cinnamon and sugar.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Butter</b> and/or <b>Syrup</b>. Garnish with 
    fruit if desired. A dollop of yogurt with the fruit wouldn't hurt 
    either.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Alternatively this can be half and 
  half for a richer toast.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bread:</h3> &nbsp; White bread is generally used, 
  with the crust left on. Day old bread is better than fresh. This recipe 
  will make 4 to 6 slices depending on size and other factors.</li>
<li id="p3">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; In England, this recipe is called 
  "Poor Knights of Windsor", and the name "Poor Knights" was used in 
  German and Scandinavian languages from the 14th century. The earliest 
  recipe is from Apicius, somewhere between the 1st Century CE and the 
  fall of the Roman Empire. Tailivent offered a recipe named 
  "Tost&eacute;es Dor&eacute;es" in the 14th Century. Today it is called 
  "Pain Perdu" (lost bread) in French, referring to otherwise unusable 
  day-old bread. In France it is rarely served as a breakfast dish. This 
  recipe became well known in North America under the name "French Toast" 
  from being featured in railroad dining cars in the early 20th century.
