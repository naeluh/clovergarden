An easy breakfast and easy to clean up after - and it's tasty too! 
Some people call the One Eye "Toad in a Hole" - but we know what a 
real <a href="bmm_toadhole1.html"><b>Toad in the 
Hole</b></a> is and can't condone that practice.

  <b><u>Method #1</u></b> &nbsp; - properly cooked eggs - See 
    <a href="gbd_oneeyej1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.
  <ol>
  <li>Melt some <b>Butter</b> in your skillet. How much depends on your 
    preferred flavor / calorie ratio - it will nearly all be absorbed 
    by the bread.</li>
  <li>Break the <b>EGG</b> into a small shallow bowl and make sure the yolk 
    is not broken.</li>
  <li>Cut a hole in the center of a slice of <b>Bread</b>. I use a 2-7/8 
    inch diameter tumbler as a cutter to do this. Eat the bread disk.</li>
  <li>Bring your skillet up to medium and put in the <b>Bread</b>. Fry 
    the bread gently until browned as you like it.</li>
  <li>Flip the bread over, drop a tiny piece of butter through the hole and 
    carefully dump in the <b>Egg</b>.</li>
  <li>Let it all fry on rather low heat until the egg white has set pretty 
    much all he way through.</li>
  <li>Serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle on salt and pepper to taste. Dip 
    pieces of the bread into the yolk which acts as sauce for both bread 
    and egg.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Method #2</u></b> &nbsp; - overcooked eggs.
  <ol>
  <li>Melt some <b>Butter</b> in your skillet. How much depends on your 
    preferred flavor / calorie ratio - it will nearly all be absorbed 
    by the bread.</li>
  <li>Break the <b>EGG</b> into a small shallow bowl being careful not to 
    break the yolk.</li>
  <li>Cut a hole in the center of a slice of <b>Bread</b>. I use a 2-7/8 
    inch diameter tumbler as a cutter to do this. Eat the bread disk.</li>
  <li>Bring your skillet up to medium, put in the <b>Bread</b> and dump 
    the egg into the hole. Fry the bread gently until browned as you like 
    it and the egg white is cooked most of the way through.</li>
  <li>Turn the <b>Bread</b> over without breaking the yolk. This is actually 
    a lot easier than you might at first think. There's no free oil in the 
    pan, so just pick up the bread with a wide thin turner, tilt the pan 
    vertical, turn the bread into it and set back down on the burner.</li>
  <li>Fry on the second side just long enough to set the yolk the way you 
    like. The bread will not be much browned on the bottom side but that's 
    not a problem.</li>
  <li>Use the turner to lift the bread out onto a warm plate, then wipe 
    out the skillet with a paper towel and do the next one.</li>
  <li>Serve warm. Sprinkle on salt and pepper to taste.</li>  
  </ol></td>
