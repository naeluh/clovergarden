Ghee is much used in Africa, the Near and Middle East, Central and 
South Asia, and east to Malaysia and Indonesia.</td>

Ghee can be stored for long periods without refrigeration, and also can 
be used for frying at elevated temperatures, up to 480&deg;F/250&deg;C. 
It has a buttery flavor that may be distinctly nutty, depending on how 
high the temperature is taken when it is made. The photo is of freshly 
made Ghee in a semi-solid slurry phase.

Select a burner on your stove that can be very precisely controlled near 
the bottom of its heat range, and preferably one with a heat spreader, 
as in the photo, or use some other heat spreader on the burner.
<br class=cll>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee15d.jpg" alt="Melting Butter" class=mrg>
Purchase 1 pound of a top grade <u>unsalted</u> butter and melt it 
slowly in a heavy bottomed pan. The pan in the photo is a 1-1/2 quart 
tri-ply sauce pan. It would be large enough for 2 pounds of butter. Do 
not disturb the butter as it melts.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee16d.jpg" alt="Melted Butter" class=mrg>
Once the Butter has completely melted without being disturbed, there will 
be a layer of foam on the top, and some milk solids will have fallen to 
the bottom. This foam must be carefully skimmed off.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee19d.jpg" alt="Partially Skimmed Butter" class=mrg>
Here the foam has been partially skimmed off, exposing the melted butter. 
Skim it all off and simmer the butter, skimming any additional foam. 
You will see bubbling as the water in the butter slowly boils off. Barely 
visible in the center of the pan are some bubbles. Let this boiling 
proceed slowly.</p>
<p><span class=lg><b>Clarified Butter:</b></span> &nbsp; Eventually the 
bubbling will slow and be a lot more erratic, with small bursts of 
bubbles rising to the surface. The temperature will start to rise above 
212&deg;F/100&deg;C. When it gets quite erratic and up to around 
240&deg;F/115&deg;C, you can call it <b>Clarified Butter</b>, give it 
a final skim and decant it off the solids in the bottom. There will still 
be some residual water in the butter, but Clarified Butter is usually 
used right away, so this will not be a problem.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee21d.jpg" alt="Now the Butter is Ghee" class=mrg>
At this point, the bubbling has stopped, the butter has become a light 
honey color, and the temperature has risen to about 290&deg;F/140&deg;C.
You can see the lightly browned milk solids in the bottom of the pan. The 
butter I used here, Challenge grade AA, left very little solids on the 
bottom. At this point, we have <b>Ghee</b>. Some people like a nuttier 
flavor and let the temperature rise higher and the Ghee get darker.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee23d.jpg" alt="Final Straining of Ghee" class=mrg>
Now do a final skimming and pass the Ghee through an extremely fine mesh 
strainer (these can be found in East / Southeast Asian markets), or a double 
layer of cheesecloth. There must be no foam or milk solids left in the Ghee, 
or it could spoil.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee25d.jpg" alt="Finishaed Ghee" class=mrg>
Here we have the finished Ghee, still in it's melted state. In a tightly 
sealed jar, it will last for several weeks at room temperature. It will 
be liquid, slurry or solid depending on room temperature. The photo at 
the top of the page is from this batch cooled to the semi-solid slurry 
state. Refrigerated it will last pretty much forever.</p>
<p><span class=lg><b>Caution:</b> </span> &nbsp; When spooning Ghee out 
of the jar, it is important that the tools you use be totally dry. Any 
moisture introduced could result in spoilage. The jar you store it in 
must also have been totally dry before pouring the Ghee into it.
