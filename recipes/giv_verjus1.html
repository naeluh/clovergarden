Verjus was an important souring agent in Europe from the time of Ancient 
Greece to around 1900, when vinegar production ramped up - but it is 
still occasionally used in France for its unique flavor.

Verjus is much used in Anatolia and Caucasus, as well as the Near and 
Middle East. It is available bottled from California and Perigord, 
France, but it costs a lot less to make your own.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
<li>Wash the grapes. Pick them off the stems (a few tiny ones included 
won't hurt).</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil over high heat. Dump the grapes in 
for just a few seconds. This kills the yeast on the outside of grapes 
and will delay fermentation of the juice. Refresh with cold water and 
drain well.</li>
<li>Place the grapes in a food processor with the sharp metal blade and 
run until thoroughly mashed, usually around 15 seconds.</li>
<li>Place in a non-reactive strainer (nylon) and press with a wooden 
 spoon until all the juice is out.</li> 
<li>For more thorough filtering you can squeeze through a muslin bag.</li>
<li>If you want to eliminate all sediment, run through a coffee filter or 
a mesh strainer lined with a paper towel.</li>
<li>Refrigerate. Use within about 5 days or freeze.</li>
