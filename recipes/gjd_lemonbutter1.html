Lemon butter sauce, often used with fish and various vegetables, is 
pretty much anything you want that includes lemon and butter as major 
ingredients. Those given here are my favorites.
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Recipes as given here are quite lemony, but you can balance 
to your taste by changing the ratio of wine to lemon juice. 
Lemon butter sauce can be thickened with a little corn starch 
suspended in water but I usually don't.
