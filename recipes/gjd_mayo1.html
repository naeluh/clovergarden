Home made Mayonnaise is superior to any commercial product, provided 
a high quality oil is used. This recipe presents the traditional method, 
but takes Raymond Sokolov's advice to use Dijon mustard for greater 
stability - see <a href="gjd_mayo1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>. See also 
<a href="gjd_mayo1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> on egg safety.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 minutes (hand beaten - 
    much faster by machine))
  <br><b>Caution:</b> For one, or maybe even two recipes, don't 
    use kitchen machinery, just a bowl and wire whip. The yolk sticks 
    to the machine's container and the blades or beaters can't get to 
    it, so there isn't enough for the oil and the sauce crashes.
  <ol>  
  <li>Set your <b>EGG</b> out long enough to come to room temperature. 
    Separate the yolk from the white (use the white for something else).
    </li>
  <li>Place <b>Egg</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Dijon</b> in the mixing bowl 
    and whip together.</li> 
  <li>Whipping continuously, very slowly dribble in just a little 
    <b>Oil</b>  until the mayonnaise "takes" and has a creamy 
    consistency.</li>
  <li>Now whip in the <b>LEMON JUICE</b>, then continue adding <b>Oil</b> 
    while whipping. The oil can be streamed in a little faster as you go. 
    If it's getting too stiff to work, add just a tiny bit of water, and 
    a mayonnaise that's too stiff may break.</li>
  <li>Whip in <b>PEPPER</b> to taste and adjust consistency with a touch of 
    water if needed. Refrigerate and use in less than a week.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use Pure Olive Oil (lightly 
  refined) rather than Virgin, for lighter flavor, and because Virgin 
  interferes with oil emulsification. Olive Pomace and other refined 
  oils can also be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Repair:</h3> &nbsp; If your sauces starts to 
  break, you can often repair it by beating in another teaspoon of Dijon. 
  A badly broken sauce can be repaired by starting with a new egg yolk 
  and feeding in the broken sauce as you would the oil.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Raw Egg Yolk:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe requires 
  raw egg yolk. Here in "over regulated" California there have never 
  been reports of salmonella poisoning from home cooking, and I would 
  not hesitate to use this recipe. If you live in a "business friendly" 
  Red State like Iowa, you may want to think about it. You will find 
  much more on egg handling and safety on our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html"><b>Eggs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Commercial Mayo:</h3> &nbsp; Commercial products 
  are convenient, safe, and can be kept refrigerated much longer. If you 
  decide to use commercial, just about all food writers agree the one to 
  use is Best Foods "Real Mayonnaise" (west of the Mississippi) or 
  Hellmann's "Real Mayonnaise" (east of the Mississippi and Canada). 
  These are the same product.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Raymond Sokolov explains  
  that purists will claim mayonnaise doesn't include Dijon, but, 
  "Purists will tell you anything so long as it makes your life more 
  difficult". Historically, mayonnaise has contained a lot of different 
  things at different times. If you do not use Dijon, the recipe will 
  still work, but with a little more risk of it breaking down early. 
  For newer methods and a method that uses lightly cooked egg yolks 
  see Harold McGee's <i>The Curious Cook</i>.</li>
