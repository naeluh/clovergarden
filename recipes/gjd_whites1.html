This very simple sauce is the base for many dishes and many sauces. 
Before the French Revolution it was a veal velout&eacute; with a lot of 
cream in it, but this form was set down by Auguste Escoffier in 1903, 
and has been standard ever since.

  <b>Important:</b> start a bit more than you need. Some will stick 
    to the sides of the pan, and if you scrape it down you'll get lumps.
  <ol>
  <li>In a heavy bottom saucepan, preferably a Windsor pan (flaring sides 
    for easier stirring), make a white roux. Melt <b>Butter</b> over very 
    moderate heat. There should be no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Flour</b> (all purpose flour is fine). Stir constantly 
    over very moderate heat until it has lost its raw taste but without any 
    browning - about 1 minute. Determine this by smell, not taste or you'll 
    burn your tongue.</li> 
  <li>Take off heat. Slowly at first stir in cold <b>Milk</b> stirring 
    constantly until you have a smooth sauce (<a href="gjd_whites1.html#02"><b>
    Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Back on the heat, bring it up gently to a very slow simmer and cook 
    stirring until thickened, just a few minutes. Make sure it does not 
    scald to the bottom of the pan.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. The amounts given 
    work very well, but more or less may be called upon depending on use. 
    Sometimes other seasonings are called for as well (<a href="gjd_whites1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li>If you have mild lumps you can press the sauce through a sieve.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Thickener:</h3> &nbsp; The amount of butter and 
  flour (equal weight) varies depending on use. For a very thin sauce, 
  half as much as given in this recipe and for a very thick sauce twice 
  as much. If you have to measure rather than weigh, 2 T butter, 3-1/2 T 
  of flour. This recipe is about right for macaroni and cheese casseroles 
  and similar uses.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Whole milk is best. Most 
  recipes on the Internet call for simmering milk to be mixed with hot 
  roux, often roux to milk rather than as I have given. Cold milk slowly 
  stirred into hot roux is less risky, and is the way called for by 
  Mapie, Countess of Toulouse-Lautrec, Dione Lucas and Alma Lach, all of 
  whom knew a thing or two about French cooking.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Pepper is a "non-optional" 
  ingredient. Usually white pepper is used for more even color and to 
  provide a more aromatic flavor, but black pepper can be used if you don't 
  mind the black specs in the white sauce.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Seasonings:</h3> &nbsp; The most common additional 
  seasoning is a pinch of nutmeg. If you have used white pepper it will 
  already have a suggestion of nutmeg. Many recipes simmer the sauce 20 
  minutes with a small onion stuck with a clove and bay leaf (from Escoffier).
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cream:</h3> &nbsp; If the sauce is to be "stand alone", it 
  should be made a little thicker and cut with cream for richer flavor.
  </li>
