This fresh tasting tomato sauce recipe uses fresh ripe tomatoes - 
preferably home grown, or from a farmer's market. I have had success with 
some types from specialty produce markets. See

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel the <b>TOMATOES</b>. One minute in rapidly boiling water, then 
    chill in cold water, core and pull off the peel.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>Tomatoes</b> 1/2 inch or less. Keep the juice with them - 
    much of the flavor is in the juice.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Chop <b>CELERY</b> small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; ()
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot or a 5 quart saut&eacute; pan, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> over moderate heat, stirring 
    until the onions treaten to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and continue to fry stirring until garlic 
    starts to color (and stick to the pan).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Bay Leaves</b> and <b>Thyme</b>. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer down, stirring frequently. Start on fairly high 
    heat and lower the heat as the liquid boils out. You want to still 
    have some free liquid when you finish because if the tomatoes get 
    too dry they lose their fresh flavor.</li>
  <li>Pull out the <b>Bay Leaves</b> and stems from the <b>Thyme 
    Sprigs</b>. Ladle out about 2 cups of <b>Sauce</b> and run it in a 
    mini-prep food processor or similar until pur&eacute;ed. Stir it 
    back into the sauce. Of course you can do more or even all depending 
    on the texture you want, but 2 cups is what I like.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Sauce</b> back to a simmer. Season to taste with 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Stir in the <b>Parsley</b> and 
    simmer a couple minutes more.</li>
  <li>Serve - generally with pasta of choice. For the coarse texture I 
    like, I prefer medium shells, conchiglioni or other shapes that will 
    scoop up lumps of tomato well (the photo shows conchiglioni). Drain 
    the pasta and return to the pot. Stir in just enough sauce to coat 
    the pasta very lightly to keep it from sticking. Serve with a big 
    dollop of sauce on top, or pass a bowl of sauce separately.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Generally for sauces you're better off with 
  canned tomatoes, but a nice fresh sauce can be made with fresh tomatoes, 
  if they are are good enough. They must be very ripe, even a little 
  over-ripe, and must have good flavor. I have achieved a good sauce with 
  large size cluster tomatoes when they are at their peak (generally when 
  the price is lowest). I set them out on the counter for about 4 days to 
  continue ripening before using them.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thyme:</h3> &nbsp; This could also be other herbs of 
  choice, fresh or dried. Oregano, Marjoram and Savory are good.</li>
