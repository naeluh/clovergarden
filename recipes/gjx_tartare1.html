A popular sauce served with fried fish, oysters, scallops and the like.
Use Pure olive oil, not Extra Virgin which could overpower. See

  <li>Drain thoroughly all <b>Flavoring items</b>, chop very fine and 
    mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Separate <b>Egg Yolks</b> making sure no white is included. Whisk 
    lightly in a mixing bowl, then whisk in the <b>Spices mix</b> and 
    whisk as long as needed to make smooth.</li>
  <li>Start adding <b>Olive Oil</b> a half teaspoon at a time whisking 
    in well, then in teaspoons and finally tablespoons making sure each 
    addition is mixed in well before adding the next. Once you've added 
    1/2 the Olive Oil alternate with Vinegar until all of both are used 
    up and you have a smooth sauce.</li>
  <li>Mix in the chopped <b>Flavoring mix</b>. Refrigerate and use in 
    less than a week (two weeks if using commercial mayonnaise).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Raw Egg Yolk:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe uses raw egg yolk. If you 
  are uncomfortable with that, see <a href="gjx_tartare1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.
  Here in "over regulated" California there have never been reports of 
  salmonella poisoning from home cooking, and I would not hesitate to 
  use this recipe. If you live in a "business friendly" Red State like 
  Iowa, you may want to think about it. You will find much more on egg 
  handling and safety on our <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html#safe">
  <b>Eggs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; To avoid raw Egg Yolk or to make a version 
  that can be refrigerated longer, use 2/3 cup commercial Mayonnaise in 
  place of the Egg Yolks and Olive Oil, and cut the Vinegar to 2 T. Most 
  food writers prefer Best Foods "Real Mayonnaise" (west of the 
  Mississippi) or Hellmann's "Real Mayonnaise" (east of the Mississippi 
  and Canada). These are the same product.</li>
