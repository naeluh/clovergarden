These are just wonderful for flavoring or garnish - but, <u>do ahead</u>, as 
you'll be standing at the stove for 50 minutes or more.  See also

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut a bit off the stem end of the <b>ONIONS</b>, then cut in half 
    lengthwise. Make another lengthwise cut to make quarters - but not 
    all the way through the root end. Slice crosswise thin, and as evenly 
    as you can manage.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart), melt <b>Butter</b> and 
    stir in <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Onions</b> and sprinkle with 
    <b>Salt</b> - it helps them brown evenly.</li> 
  <li>Fry <b>Onions</b> starting on medium high heat. Stir very often, and 
    make sure you're turning the Onions over, not just sliding them around.  
    Fry on declining heat and increasing stirring. Regulate the heat so you 
    see no browning until near the end when the Onions start to take color. 
    </li>
  <li>Near the end, stir almost constantly. The moment you see the color you 
    want, pour them out into a bowl to cool.</li>
  <li>These will keep in a the fridge in a sealed package or jar, for at least 
    a week.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, for Vegan you can use all Olive Oil, without 
  losing too much flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; We use a fair amount of butter and oil in this 
  recipe, important for even browning. Don't worry about it, these Onions 
  are used in very modest quantity. That 1-1/2 pounds of Onions ends up at 
  about 3.9 ounces, unless you eat too many while frying them.</li>
