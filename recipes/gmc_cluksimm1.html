Many recipes call for "cooked chicken". Simmering is a very easy and 
convenient way to have tender and tasty cooked chicken.  You also end up 
with some very fine chicken broth. I find the method with 6 cups of water 
makes particularly good broth.

  <li>Skin <b>CHICKEN</b> or not, depending on the ethnicity of your 
    recipe. In India, some areas of Southeast Asia and much of 
    Sub-Saharan Africa, skins are not much used. Skinless broth will 
    be thinner in flavor.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Chicken</b> or not depending on your intent (See 
    <a href="gmc_cluksimm1x.html#gallery"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>). 
    A whole chicken will take about 12 cups of water, parted for 
    simmering will take about 6 cups and parted to serving pieces will 
    take about 4 cups. The more water the less concentrated the 
    finished broth will be.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Chicken</b> in a pot - a 5 quart will work fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> medium, chop <b>CELERY TOPS</b> medium and put 
    both in the pot along with <b>Peppercorns</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Add water to cover (see above) and bring to a boil. Turn heat down 
    to low and simmer until tender (about 40 minutes).</li>
  <li>For best results let the chicken cool in the broth. Remove 
    <b>Chicken</b>, drain well and pull the meat from the bones (see 
    <a href="gmc_cluksimm1.html#02"><b><b>Note-2</b></b></a>). Do not attempt to slice 
    or cut into cubes until well chilled in the fridge.</li> 
  <li>Strain the broth, then defat it using your gravy separator. 
    Refrigerate when cool enough - see <a href="gmc_cluksimm1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> 
    for details.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Chicken:</b> &nbsp; A 4 pound chicken will yield about 1-1/3 pounds 
  of skinless, boneless meat after simmering (34%) -  plus excellent 
  chicken broth. Leg quarters work well also if you don't need wings 
  and breast meat (I don't use breast meat because its texture and 
  flavor are inferior to thigh/leg meat), It can also be done with 
  packaged skinless boneless thigh/leg meat, now economically available 
  (see <a href="gmc_cluksimm1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). For further details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bd_chicken.html#yield"><b>Parts &amp; Yields</b></a> 
  tables.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Bones:</b> &nbsp; While deboning be sure to eat 
  all the cartilage at the ends of the bones. Some medical researchers 
  have reported it very good for joints and arthritis.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Broth:</b> &nbsp; If you bring the broth back to 
  a boil after de-fatting, and pour it into clean heat resistant jars 
  (I use 4 cup sauerkraut and pickle jars) while still very hot, and 
  immediately cap them tightly, it'll keep for months in the fridge. 
  For details see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock 
  / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Leg Meat</b> &nbsp; This excellent product, made from the tastiest 
  parts of the chicken (legs and thighs), is a recent development (2008). 
  Due to Americans' misguided preference for cardboard like breast meat, 
  huge amounts of legs and thighs were shipped to Russia. Then the 
  Russians developed their own chicken industry and immediately declared 
  American chicken "unsafe". Processors had to find a way to market legs 
  in North America and devleoped a method of deboning whole leg-thigh 
  modules, resulting in a convenient product - just in time, because 
  consumer preference has been turning to darker meat. 4 pounds of leg 
  meat simmered will yield  2 pounds 5 ounces of leg meat (58%).
