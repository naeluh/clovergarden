<h1>Baking Fish</h1>
<br><img src="img/gmf_mackstuff1e.jpg" alt="Baked Mackerel on Platter" class=mrg>
<p>
Baking fish is easy and produces little mess. Essentially, the fish 
is steamed in it's own juices, with perhaps some lemon juice, white wine 
and aromatic herbs to enhance them.

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>

<ol>
<li>Scale and clean the fish per method on our page 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html">Cleaning and Filleting Round Fish</a> 
  or <a href="../ingred/seafishcd.html">Cleaning &amp; Filleting Deep 
  Bodied Fish</a>, whichever is applicable. Pan dress the fish if you 
  want it that way, otherwise leave it whole.</li>
<li>Many fish need several diagonal slashes half way through the flesh on 
  both sides to keep skin shrink from randomly tearing the fish and making 
  it unattractive. The Red Snapper in the photos has skin with very modest 
  shrink so it doesn't need slashes.</li>
<li>Rub the fish with kosher salt and a little pepper, also rub a 
  little on the inside of the body cavity. Brush both sides of the fish with 
  Extra Virgin olive oil.</li>
<li>At this point you have options. The Red Snapper shown has just a sprig 
of Rosemary placed in the body cavity. You can pour a tablespoon of white 
wine around the fish, or place several very thin slices of lemon over the 
top (as shown on a pan dressed trout), or you can stuff the cavity  
as was the baked mackerel at the top left of this page.</li>
<li>Seal the package as tightly as you can to contain the steam as the fish 
cooks.</li>
<li>Bake according to the table below</li>
<li>Serving: &nbsp; You can serve the fish as baked (as was the stuffed 
mackerel at the top of this page, or you can dismantle the fish for serving. 
Our instruction <a href="gmf_fishdisa1.html">Dismantling Cooked Fish</a> 
continue with the Red Snapper used here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="timeb">Baking Time</h2>

<p>Others have published times much shorter than mine - I tried theirs 
and got raw fish. A fish that's baked a few minutes over is still just 
fine, but an underdone fish is a disaster, particularly if you try to 
disassemble it for serving.</p>
<p>Most recommend "Cook until opaque and flakes easily" which can be 
difficult to determine without destroying the product. FDA guidelines are 
an internal temperature of 145&deg;F/63&deg;C for 15 seconds, or 
165&deg;F/74&deg;C for stuffed fish (higher 'cause they have no idea what 
you've stuffed it with).</p>

<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Hints for many kinds of fish are on the 
  "Details and Cooking" pages linked from our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). Some fish stay firm and manageable while others 
  tend break up. Baking is more tolerant than other cooking methods, 
  but you still want fish that stays together reasonably well.</li>
<li><h3>Dismantling:</h3>  &nbsp; If you intend to dismantle your fish 
into fillets before serving, selecting a fish that cooks firm is 
important. Even more important is that the fish be done all the way 
through to the backbone or you'll break it up trying to get the fillets 
loose.</li>
<li><h3>Done:</h3> &nbsp; One test for doneness of a baked fish is to pull 
out the dorsal (top) fin. If it doesn't pull out smoothly and easily the 
fish isn't done.</li>
<li><h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; You can use your best Ultra Virgin Olive Oil for 
this cooking method.</li>
<li><h3>Marinading:</h3> &nbsp; If you marinade fish, let them soak up the 
marinade for about 20 minutes at room temperature or 1 hour in the 
refrigerator. Salt and acid in the marinade will retard spoilage but 
don't leave them out more than about 20 minutes. If you use leftover 
marinade for a sauce <i>bring it to a high simmer for 5 minutes</i> in 
a saucepan to make sure it's safe </li>
</ul>
