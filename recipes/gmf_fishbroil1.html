Broiling is a fish cooking method that's fast, tasty, easy to clean up 
after and keeps the stove top clear for other uses. The downside is the 
amount of energy used and heating up the kitchen.</span>

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>

<p>In this example we'll use a 12 inch Black Pomfret (which is a 
actually a Pompano). The photo specimen is a bit large for a single 
portion, in practice I'd go for two smaller fish to serve two people, 
each in it's separate foil tray for easy handling.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're using a marinade, get your fish soaking in it in the fridge. 
 You want about 1/2 to 1 hour soak, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Prepare your broiler pan and preheat your broiler.</li>
<li>Make a tray out of aluminum foil sufficient to fit the fish. Fold the 
  sides and ends to strengthen them so you can lift the fish out of the 
  broiler by the foil - but not too thick so they cool quickly. If you 
  fold the sides downward first and then bend them upward it'll be easier 
  to slide the fish off later because it won't catch on the fold. Punch 
  some holes through this foil so liquid can drain or you're likely to be 
  steaming your fish rather than broiling it. Brush the foil with Olive 
  Oil.</li>
<li>Make sure your fish is ready and dry. If it's been marinading clean 
  off all marinade it hasn't absorbed. If you're going to use that extra 
  marinade get it into a saucepan and bring it to a high simmer for about 
  5 minutes.</li>
<li>Make three shallowly diagonal cuts part way through the flesh on both 
  sides. Brush both sides of the fish with Olive Oil. Place the fish 
  in the foil tray you have made <u>good side down</u> so it'll be up 
  after turning.</li>
<li>Some recipes will have you also brush the fish with lemon juice at 
  this point, or rub it with seasonings. Herbs and seasonings can be 
  worked into the diagonal cuts to penetrate the flesh better.</li>
<li>Set you broiler pan low. My antique Wedgwood stove has a maximum of 
  3-1/2 inches between the heating element and the pan but that seems to 
  be enough for fish of reasonable size. Line your broiler pan with foil 
  so liquid that drains through the holes you've punched will be easy to 
  clean up. Check that your broiler is fully up to temperature.</li> 
<li>Place the fish in its tray onto the broiler pan, slide it in under the 
  burner and close the door.</li>
<li>Check your fish periodically so you don't burn it. If you want to 
  keep the tail and gill cover from charring you can put small pieces of 
  foil over those parts when they've got enough color.</li>
<li>Broil a little less than half the time on the first side. When it 
  looks good, slide the broiler tray out. In just a few seconds the 
  sides of the foil tray will be cool enough for you to touch them. 
  Pick up the fish with a thin wide turner and steady it by holding 
  one of the edges.</li>
<li>Turn the fish over. I do this by sliding the thin turner under the 
  fish, being careful not to damage it, Then I place the foil over the 
  fish and turn the works over.</li>
<li>Put the fish back on the broiler pan and broil the other side.</li>
<li>When the fish is done on the second side, bring it out again and 
  slide it off onto the serving plate, apply sauce, garnish and serve.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="time">Broiling Time Table</h2>

<p>These times are approximate because a lot depends on the fish and 
particularly on your broiler - they vary a lot.</p>

<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Hints for many kinds of fish are on the 
  "Details and Cooking" pages linked from our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). Some fish stay firm and manageable while others 
  tend break up. Broiling is more tolerant than grilling, but you still 
  want fish that stays together reasonably well.</li>
<li><h3>Select:</h3> &nbsp; Broil fish that are fairly thin so they cook 
  through before they burn on the outside - about 1-1/2 inch max, but 
  steaks and fillets should be at least 1/2 inch thick or they'll dry out 
  like boards.</li>
<li><h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use an oil that can stand the temperature. Pure 
  Olive Oil should do, or Olive Pomace.</li>
<li><h3>Marinading:</h3> &nbsp; If you marinade fish, let them soak up the 
  marinade for about 1/2 hour to 1 hour in the refrigerator. Fish spoil 
  fast - don't leave them out. If you use leftover marinade for a sauce 
  <i>bring it to a high simmer for 5 minutes</i> in a saucepan to make 
  sure it's safe - its been exposed to raw fish.</li>
</ul>

fish.</li>
