If your presentation requires it, or if you are serving folks who 
don't really want meet what they're eating face to face, or something 
went wrong making your whole fish unpresentable, you can disassemble 
any reasonably firm fish that has been baked, steamed, poached or even 
broiled.</span></p>

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>

<p>There are a quite a few steps here but they aren't hard or time 
consuming. Of course that depends on how cooperative your fish is. The 
Pacific Red Snapper used as an example is medium cooperative though 
not the best.</p>
<ol>
<li>First you need to cook your fish. If you plan to dismantle it after 
  cooking baking is usually the best cooking method to use. Make sure the 
  fish will be done all the way through to the backbone or your fish will 
  break up instead of coming free from the bones..</li>
<li>With a sharp knife cut through the skin all around. This will help 
  a lot because the skin is usually toughest at the edges.</li>
<li>Bend back the gill covers so you can get at the front edge of the 
  skin and peel it back. I suppose you could also start at the tail if 
  you preferred. A butter knife will help get under the skin if you have 
  any problems.</li>
<li>Now you can lift off the fillet using the same technique you would use 
  for a raw fish except you can do it with a thin turner - it should be 
  very thin.</li>
<li>Check the fillet and remove any bones, set it on a plate.</li>
<li>Starting with the tail you can now remove the backbone along with 
  most of the other bones. The head should come off with the backbone.
  </li>
<li>Remove all the fins, both top and bottom, They will pull off easily.
  </li>
<li>Clean up around the fillet and flip it over. You can now peel the skin 
  off the second side.</li>
<li>You should now have two fillets and some small fish meat fragments. 
  The fillets will probably be of slightly different size because it's 
  much easier to do the second side without pieces breaking off.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Hints for many kinds of fish are on the 
  "Details and Cooking" pages linked from our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). Some fish stay firm and manageable while others 
  tend break up. If you intend to disassemble your fish into fillets 
  before serving, selecting a fish that cooks firm is important.
  <br><b>Snappers, Mackerel, Trout</b> are among the easy to dismantle 
  fish. <b>Croakers</b> tend to break up.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Is it Done?</h3> &nbsp; Critically important is that the fish 
  be done all the way through to the backbone or you'll just break it 
  up trying to get the fillets loose.
  <br><b>Test:</b> &nbsp; For a baked fish a good test is to pull out 
  the  dorsal (top) fin. If it doesn't pull out smoothly and easily the 
  fish isn't done.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tool">Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Knife:</h3> You need a very sharp knife A filleting knife is 
preferable, but your normal kitchen knife is fine if it is very 
sharp.</li>
<li><h3>Turner</h3> You need a very thin, flexible turner or you risk 
breaking up the fish trying to get under the fillet.</li> 
</ul>
