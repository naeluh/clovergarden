<span class=bg>
Pan frying is quick and easy for fillets, steaks and small whole fish, 
and relatively hard to screw up if you follow a few simple rules. Almost 
any fish can be pan fried in one form or another.</span>

</ul>

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you're using a marinade, get your fish soaking in it in the fridge. 
  You want about 1/2 hour to 1 hour soak.</li>
<li>Prepare any coating or batter you will use. I almost always use just 
  a dusting with rice flour. If you want more browning, use wheat flour, 
  or a mix of the two. The photo examples were made with wheat flour.
  </li>
<li>Make sure your fish is ready and dry. If it's been marinading, dry 
  off any marinade it hasn't absorbed.</li>
<li>In a spacious iron skillet, bring your oil up to temperature - you 
  want about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C (when reflections off the surface start 
  to "crawl" you're good to go.</li>
<li>Dust or batter just enough fish for one batch, just before putting it 
in the oil or it will get soggy.</li>
<li>Distribute fish in the skillet, thicker pieces first. If frying 
  fillets, they go skin-side up. After a minute 
  or so push the pieces around just a little to make sure they aren't 
  stuck.</li>
<li>Fry until golden on the bottom side and turn over, thin pieces first, 
  and fry golden on the other side. Avoid having to turn the fish more 
  than once. If the fish have opened enough to be stable, you can set 
  them up to fry a bit from the belly.</li>
<li>Start removing pieces as they are done, using a slotted turner and 
  setting to drain on paper towels. Keep warm in the oven until all are 
  done.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Pan:</h3> &nbsp; You need a well seasoned cast iron pan with 
  plenty of real estate so as not to crowd your fish. You don't want to 
  use your expensive multi-ply stainless saut&eacute; pan to fry fish 
  for at least three reasons.
  <ul>
  <li>The slanted sides of the cast iron pan allow easy access for turners 
    and other tools at a shallow angle. The saut&eacute; pan's straight 
    sides make this much more difficult.</li>
  <li>The slanted sides of the cast iron pan allow easier air circulation 
    to carry away steam, while a straight sided pan traps steam and your 
    fish ends up half fried and half steamed. Saut&eacute; pans, 
    interestingly, aren't very good for saut&eacute;ing but excellent 
    for many other uses.</li>
  <li>No matter how careful you are you're going to get oil on the outside 
    of your saut&eacute; pan which will be baked on by time you're done. 
    These oil deposits are unsightly and amazingly difficult to scrub off.
  </li>
  </ul></li>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Hints for many kinds of fish are on the 
  "Details and Cooking" pages linked from our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). Some fish stay firm and manageable while others 
  tend break up. Coat delicate fish sufficiently to hold it together.
  </li>
<li><h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable high temperature oil - see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> for 
  appropriate oils. I use Olive Pomace which has a high smoke point, 
  no significant olive flavor, and is economical. Peanut Oil is also 
  pretty good. I don't use high polyunsaturated oils like corn or soy 
  which rapidly turn rancid when heated. Don't use Extra Virgin or any 
  other "unrefined" oil - they can't stand the heat. </li>
<li><h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes specify butter as the frying 
  medium and that's just fine too, but use real butter, not unhealthy 
  hydrogenated butter substitutes. You have to carefully monitor the 
  frying temperature, keeping it low, and fry the fish a little longer. 
  Alternatively, us Ghee (highly clarified butter) which is still 
  buttery, but goes to high temperatures.</li>
<li><h3>Temperature:</h3> &nbsp; Keep the temperature of your oil as 
  close to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C as you can. Keep it well below smoking 
  temperature at all times.</li>
<li><h3>Don't Overload Your Pan:</h3> &nbsp; Fry in batches small enough 
  so you have room to move and turn the fish. If oil temperature drops too 
  far you'll end up with heavy, oily fish with a steamed flavor.</li>
<li><h3>Coating Fish:</h3> &nbsp; While I fry some fish naked, most fish 
  I give a light powdering of rice flour or all-purpose flour. In many 
  cases it's necessary to keep the fish skin from sticking to the pan, 
  and in other cases a crust may be all that's holding delicate fillets 
  together. Wheat flour will produce a darker brown than rice flour, 
  but rice flour is lighter in flavor.</li>
<li><h3>Batter for Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes call for coating fish 
  with batter, sometimes much too heavy a batter. We're not frying 
  pancakes here, we're frying fish. A quick dip in buttermilk followed 
  by a dusting of lightly salted (or seasoned) flour is generally plenty. 
  Dipping in egg will make the coating thicker.</li>
<li><h3>Coat or Batter</h3> just before frying or you'll end up with 
  soggy batter. For the Lodge 12" skillet, lay out a standard paper towel 
  (not the long size). Coat your fish pieces and lay them out on the 
  paper towel. When the towel is full, that's what'll fit in your pan.
  </li>
<li><h3>Marinading:</h3> &nbsp; If you marinade fish, let them soak up the 
  marinade for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator. Fish spoil fast - 
  don't leave them out. If you use leftover marinade for a sauce 
  <i>bring it to a high simmer for 5 minutes</i> in a saucepan to make 
  sure it's safe </li>
<li><h3>Clean-up:</h3> &nbsp; Clean oil off your stove as soon as possible. 
  heat will dry the oil into varnish which becomes more difficult to 
  remove with each passing hour.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="tool">Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Pan:</h3> &nbsp; You need a well seasoned cast iron pan with plenty 
of real estate so as not to crowd your fish. The Lodge #10S 12" skillet 
shown is excellent.</li>
<li><h3>Turner:</h3> &nbsp; For most uses, a regular thin flexible turner 
will do fine. If you do larger whole fish or large fillets a wide fish 
turner is a good idea. Try to get a thin flexible one. The one shown 
is not flexible and was an efficient destroyer of fish until I used a 
bench grinder to grind the bottom side until the edge was almost 
knife-like.</li>
<li><h3>Thermometer:</h3> &nbsp; An infra-red 
<a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html"><b>Surface Temperature Gun</b></a> is 
very useful for regulating the oil temperature for best frying 
performance.</li> 
</ul>
