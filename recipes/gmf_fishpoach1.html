Poaching is ideal for bringing out the character of delicately 
flavored fish - and it's healthy. You can poach your fish whole, 
"pan dressed" (head and tail removed), filets, or steaks. It's also fine 
for scallops, shrimp and squid. Unlike braising or stewing, the liquid 
fish is poached in will be discarded (individual recipes may violate 
this rule), though it can be used more than one time in a single 
session.</span>

<p>Fish are generally poached in a <b>Court Bouillon</b> (say "Booyon"). 
Court means "short" in French, implying the bouillon contains herbs and 
vegetables only - no meat. The court bouillons listed here are all 
excellent and well tested. The #2 East Asia is definitely worth trying, 
fitting well with increasingly popular "fusion" cuisines.</p>

<p>For poaching a whole fish (except very deep bodied fish like Pomfret 
and Pompano) a fish poaching pan like the one shown is ideal. You could 
improvise with an oval roasting pan but it'd take even more poaching 
liquid. Even with the poaching pan a lot of liquid is needed so an 
economical court bouillon like #3 is a good idea - #1 would need a whole 
bottle of white wine which you might rather be drinking.</p>

<p>The method outline here is deep poaching where the fish is submerged 
and the liquid is discarded after use. Another method of "poaching" fish 
in "court bouillon" uses relatively shallow liquid with both liquid and 
vegetables served as a sauce with the fish. 
<a href="6mf_catfshcreole1.html"><b>Creole Catfish in Court 
Bouillon</b></a> is an example, but this method is also used in France.
</p>

<p><u>Fish suitable for poaching</u>: &nbsp; Bass, Cod, Haddock, Halibut, 
  Pomfret, Pompano, Salmon, Snapper, Sole, Tilapia, Trout, Turbot.
<br><u>Matter of Opinion</u>: &nbsp; Catfish - some people just don't 
  like poached catfish, but I have no objection to it at all. 
<br><u>Not so good for poaching</u>: &nbsp; Shark, Mackerel, Tuna.</p>

<h2 id="court">Court Bouillon Recipes</h2> 
<p>#1 is the classic French poach but my favorites are #4 with Red Wine 
and #2 East Asia (very tasty, compatible with Western sauces, and 
economical), but for simplicity and economy, no other can match #5.</p>
<p>A half recipe or a little more is sufficient for thin filets in a 2 
quart saute pan. For a whole fish in an 18 inch fish poacher you will 
need about a double recipe. With Court Bouillon #1 you'd have a whole 
bottle of wine invested so you probably want a fish about 16 inches long 
weighing around 2 pounds to make it worthwhile - or use the #3 with 
vinegar, or #5.<p></p>

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select a saut&eacute; pan, fish poacher or other tightly coverable 
    vessel sufficient in size and depth to hold your fish completely covered 
    with water. It should have enough room so filets are not on top of each 
    other or they won't poach evenly.</li>
  <li>To find out how much liquid you need, put the fish in the pan 
    and fill with cold water to the necessary depth. The liquid should be 
    enough to cover but not much more. Remove the fish and measure the water. 
    <u>Note:</u> if you're poaching filets they will curl some so you need a 
    little extra depth. Fillets are very rarely poached skin-on, because 
    those would curl up into rolls.</li>
  <li>Select the ingredients for the poaching liquid you wish to use, 
    adjusting the amount to the amount of water. Prepare them as needed 
    and place all ingredients in the pan with the measured amount of cold 
    water. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for 1/2 hour or as noted in 
    "Hints" below.</li>
  <li>Strain the poaching liquid if desired and set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Prepare the rest of your meal and the sauce you will serve the fish 
    with. The fish will poach quickly and should be served immediately.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>For Filets, Shellfish, Small Fish.</u></b>
  <ol start="6">
  <li>When ready to go, bring the poaching liquid to a boil, reduce to a 
    simmer.</li>
  <li>Lower the fish into the liquid and turn the heat to high. The moment 
    you see the first bubbles of boiling turn off the heat and cover the 
    pan tightly. Let it sit for about 4 to 10 minutes depending on thickness. 
    Remove fish and serve.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>For Larger or Thicker Fish Fillets</u></b>
  <ol start="6">
  <li>When ready to go, bring the poaching liquid to a boil, reduce to 
    a simmer.</li>
  <li>lower the fish into the liquid and turn the heat up. As soon as 
    you see the first bubbles of boiling turn the heat down to below a 
    simmer and cover tightly. Check in a bit to make sure the liquid is 
    barely moving with few or no bubbles reaching the surface.  Poach 
    for 10 minutes to 20 minutes depending on size of fish.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>For Whole Fish with Skin On</u></b>
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Strain the Court Bouillon and let it cool. Starting with cold 
    Bouillon minimizes skin breakage.</li>
  <li>When ready to go, lower the fish into the liquid, cover tightly 
    and bring to a simmer over medium heat, checking now and then.</li>
  <li>When the first bubbles break the surface, turn the heat down to 
    below a simmer. Poach for 10 to 20 minutes depending on size of 
    fish.</li>
  </ol>


<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Fish to be Served Cold</b> &nbsp; They should be allowed to cool 
  in the cooking liquid for best flavor and texture.
  <p></p></li>
<li><b>#1 Court Bouillon:</b> &nbsp; Cut <b>Celery</b>, <b>Onion</b>  
  and <b>Lemon</b> into medium slices crosswise and put <b>All 
  Ingredients</b> into a pot. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1/2 hour. 
  Strain before poaching the fish.
  <br><u>Variations</u>: many variations of the herbs and amounts exist. 
  Some include carrot and herbs may include thyme and tarragon.
  <p></p></li>
<li><b>#2 East Asia:</b> &nbsp;  Put the <b>Cilantro</b> sprigs in whole. 
  Peel <b>Garlic</b> and crush with the side of the knife. Slice 
  <b>Ginger</b> and hit with the back of your knife or a kitchen mallet 
  to crush slightly. cut <b>Scallions</b> into 1" lengths. Add <b>Oil</b> 
  and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer liquid for only 5 to 10 minutes before adding 
  fish. 
  <br><u>Variations</u>: for a more Thai version use basil in place of some 
  of the cilantro.
  <p></p></li>
<li><b>#3 Court Bouillon with Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; some chefs recommend 
  vinegar rather than wine when poaching shellfish, but vinegar court 
  bouillon is also used for fish. Also, some use a mix of vinegar and 
  white wine. You'll want to use a good quality white wine vinegar in 
  most cases. Slice <b>Onion</b> and <b>Carrot</b> crosswise thin. 
  Peel <b>Garlic</b> and crush with the flat side of a knife. Put 
  <b>All Ingredients</b> into a pot, bring to a boil and simmer 1/2 
  hour. Strain the liquid before use.
  <p></p></li>
<li><b>#4 Court Bouillon with Red Wine:</b> &nbsp; Cut <b>Celery</b>, 
  <b>Carrot</b> and <b>Onion</b> into medium slices crosswise and put 
  <b>All Ingredients</b> into a pot. Bring to a boil and simmer for 
  1/2 hour. Strain before poaching the fish.<p></p></li>
<li><b>#5 Court Bouillon "No-Fuss"</b> &nbsp; OK, I Confess. This is 
  the one I use 90% of the time. Just bring to a boil and you're ready 
  to go. After poaching, I place the fish on a deep plate, spoon over it 
  a good amount of my <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html"><b>Lemon Wine Sauce 
  for Fish</b></a> and disassemble the fish at the table with chopsticks 
  (pointy ones  are particularly good for small fish with bones). I hope 
  this does  not caused any French Chefs to loose sleep or break out in 
  hives.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="tool">Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Fish Poacher:</b> &nbsp; This pan is excellent for poaching whole 
fish of some size, especially since it comes with a rack with handles 
for lifting the fish out. Though it takes a lot less liquid than, say, 
an oval roasting pan would, it's still a lot so you really have to want 
to poach a large fish whole. On the other hand, I use the reversible lid 
of the model I have (shown above left) for a baking dish for fish and 
the whole pan and rack with just a half inch of water (or the basket 
inverted and lots of water if the fish isn't too thick) for steaming 
fish.</li>
