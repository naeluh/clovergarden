<h1>Steaming Fish</h1>
<br><h3>Worldwide</h3>

<span class=bg>
Fish is often steamed in Asia because ovens were almost unknown there 
until recently, and are still rare in traditional homes. Steaming is 
also very quick and uses much less energy than baking or broiling and is 
much lower in calories than frying, grilling or broiling. Very useful if 
you don't want to heat up the oven.</span>

<h2 id="proc1">Procedure - Chinese Dish Method</h2>

<p>More detail on this particular dish will be found in the recipe 
<a href="cmf_fishsteam1.html">
<b>Steamed Fish Chinese Style</b></a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select a fish the skin of which doesn't shrink badly.</li>
<li>Scale and clean your fish. Cut deep diagonal slanted slits on both sides 
of the fish. This helps it absorb flavors and keeps it neat looking if the 
skin shrinks a bit.</li>
<li>Rub the fish on both sides and inside with kosher salt.</li>
<li>Whatever seasonings and vegetables the recipe calls for, stuff some into 
the body cavity.</li>
<li>Place fish on the steaming dish, which will also be the serving dish.</li>
<li>Drizzle with soysauce, rice wine, sesame oil, or whatever liquids the 
recipe calls for. Spread remaining seasonings and vegetables on top and 
let marinade for 20 minutes at room temperature or an hour in the fridge.
</li>
<li>Set up the steamer with an inch or more of water and place the plate 
on the rack. Add any additional ingredients called for in the recipe.</li>
<li>Bring the water up to a rolling boil uncovered (this prevents too 
much condensation into the dish). Cover the steamer and steam at a 
moderate boil for 15 to 20 minutes depending on thickness of the fish.
</li>
<li>Serve immediately when done. All liquid that has gathered in the 
dish while steaming becomes part of the sauce.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="proc2">Procedure - Packets Method</h2>

<ol>
<li>Cut fish into bite size chunks and marinade per recipe (this Catfish was 
marinaded in fish sauce and red curry paste.</li>
<li>Lay out a double layer of banana leaf (or foil or parchment paper 
depending on ethnicity and/or what you have).</li>
<li>Fold the package up as tightly as you can without bursting or tearing 
the wrapper. It's best to put them seam side up so juices won't escape, so 
you may need to tie them or set a plate on top of them in the steamer.</li>
<li>Stack packets in the steamer leaving plenty of channels for the steam 
to rise.</li>
<li>Steam according to the table below</li>
<li><b>Serving:</b> You can serve the packets as steamed so each person can 
unwrap their own.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; (hints for many kinds of fish are in 
our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">Varieties of Fish</a> page. Baking 
is more tolerant than other methods but you'll still want fish that stays 
together reasonably well.</li>
<li><h3>Dismantling:</h3> &nbsp; If you intend to dismantle your fish 
into fillets before serving, selecting a fish that cooks firm is 
important. Even more important is that the fish be done all the way 
through to the backbone or you'll break it up trying to get the fillets 
loose.</li>
<li><h3>Done:</h3> &nbsp; One test for doneness of a steamed fish is to 
pull out the dorsal (top) fin. If it doesn't pull out smoothly and easily 
the fish isn't done.</li>
<li><h3>Marinading:</h3> &nbsp; If you marinade fish, let them soak up the 
marinade for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator or 20 minutes at room 
temperature. Salt and acid in the marinade will retard spoilage but don't 
leave the fish longer than 3/4 hour at room temperature. If you use 
leftover marinade for a sauce <i>bring it to a high simmer for 5 
minutes</i> in a saucepan to make sure it's safe - it's been exposed to 
raw fish.</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="tool">Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Wok Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; The photo shows the excellent Calphalon 
#155 13" multi-ply wok outfitted with a steamer rack and 32cm stainless 
wok cover (both from a local Asian market). It provides sufficient space 
for a decent size dish.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Steamer Pan:</h3> &nbsp; This easily available steamer pan 
fits a saucepan you probably already have. It works well but is limited 
to steaming small items, such as the packets shown above. The photo 
specimen is is by Cuisinart and fits 8, 7, and 6 inch saucepans.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Asian Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional multi-level bamboo 
steamer trays set over boiling water in a wok are fading from use due to 
difficulty keeping them clean. They are being replaced by two and three 
level stainless steel pots. The photo specimen is a two level, with a 
steamer insert in the main pot and a tray on top. A three level would 
have a second tray on top. This example is 11 inches inside diameter, 
with headroom of 2 inches in the lower tray and 3 inches in the upper 
tray. These are generally usefully large, but have the disadvantage of 
taking a lot of space if you don't do steaming every day - but so do 
the bamboo trays. The bottom can be used as a simple pot, but is not 
multi-ply, which limits is usage.<p></p></li>
<li><h3>Fish Poacher - "Re-purposed":</h3> &nbsp; My fish poacher 
(Progressive brand) has a basket that can be put in upside-down, and a 
deep lid, so there's a little more than 2-1/4 inches of headroom for 
steaming long narrow fish in it. The box mentions that the lid can be 
inverted as a broiling pan, but maybe they never thought of using the 
thing this way for steaming. If they had, I think they would have made 
the sides of the basket just a little lower for more headroom.
