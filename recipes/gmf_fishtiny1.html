<span class=bg>Some fish, like smelts, are best lightly coated and deep 
fried whole, and eaten whole. Others small fish are too large, or their heads 
and bones are too strong to eat and are easier to handle deep fired with the

</ul>

<h2 id="proc">Procedure</h2>

<p>The examples here are Smelt, small enough to eat head bones and all, 
and Round Scad, larger and with backbone and head too strong to be edible. 
While Great Lakes Smelt were traditionally eaten "head guts and feathers", 
the Smelts we get these days tend to be bitter if not gutted. Round Scad 
definitely should be gutted and it comes out much less torn up if you 
remove the head as shown.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Smelts:</h3> &nbsp;  One way to gut them is to just break in from 
  the bottom and grab the gills, then pull down and forward. Along with the 
  gills, the innards will pull out without breaking the belly. Another 
  way is to use a thin, razor sharp filleting knife. Insert the tip jut 
  under the head, sharp side out, and slit back to the vent, near the tail. 
  With this method you can also remove the dark blood works just below the 
  backbone. Just scrape it out with a fingernail and rinse under running 
  water. A batch of small to very small smelts (56 fish) took me 35 minutes 
  to gut using the split belly method with rinse.</li>
<li><h3>Scad, etc:</h3> &nbsp;  With a larger, tougher fish like the Round 
  Scad, first pinch the bottom fins just behind the head and pull them off.</li>
<li>With your kitchen shears cut just behind the head from the top just 
  deep enough to sever the backbone.</li>
<li>Now you can pull the head off and all the innards will come out with 
  it leaving the body of the fish in good condition.</li>
<li>Rinse the fish and drain cavity side down.</li>
<li><h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Select an appropriate high temperature oil. 
  See our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page for 
  the best choices.</li>
<li>Bring your oil up to temperature. A <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html">
  <b>Infrared Gun</b></a> is great here, but a long probed thermometer 
  that goes to at least 400&deg;F/200&deg;C can be used. The ideal 
  temperature is 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. Keep your oil well below smoking 
  temperature at all times.</li>
<li>Dry the fish with paper towels. There should be no free water.</li>
<li>Dust the fish lightly with lightly salted flour. Smelt can be coated 
  all at once by shaking in a plastic bag with the flour. For larger fish, 
  coat just enough for one batch just before putting them in the oil or the 
  coating could get soggy.</li>
<li>Make sure your oil is at the right temperature and put the fish in 
  (being careful not to splash). Stir often until sizzling decreases and 
  fish is lightly browned. <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; don't fry them to the 
  color you want, because they will darken significantly while draining.
  </li>
<li>Scoop out with a wire spider or other device that allows the pieces 
  to drain freely. Drain further on a wire rack or wire basket. This will 
  give you less oily fish than drying on paper towels.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="hint">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Know Your Fish:</h3> &nbsp; (hints for many kinds of fish are 
  linked from our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). Some fish stay firm and manageable while others tend 
  to break up.</li>
<li><h3>Coating Fish:</h3> &nbsp; While I fry some fish naked, most fish I 
  give a light powdering of Rice Flour, which doesn't brown much but is 
  good for the taste of the fish. If you want browner, mix in some 
  all-purpose Wheat Flour. I also usually whirl some Salt in my spice 
  grinder and mix it with the flour (it mixes better ground). A good way 
  with smelts is to put them in a plastic bag, pour in the flour and 
  shake until well coated. Pour out into a strainer and shake it a bit 
  to remove excess flour.</li>
<li><h3>Batter for Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes call for coating fish 
  with batter, sometimes much too heavy a batter. If you want pancakes, 
  make pancakes, we're frying fish here. A quick dip in buttermilk 
  followed by a dusting of lightly salted (or seasoned) flour is 
  generally plenty. Dipping in egg will make the coating thicker.</li>
<li><h3>Marinading:</h3> &nbsp; If you marinade fish, let them soak up 
  the marinade for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator. Fish spoil fast - 
  don't leave them out. If you use leftover marinade for a sauce 
  <i>bring it to a high simmer for 5 minutes</i> in a saucepan to make 
  sure it's safe </li>
<li><h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable high temperature oil - see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page for good 
  choices. I use Olive Pomace which has a high smoke point and almost no 
  olive flavor so it won't overpower the fish, and it's quite economical.
  Peanut Oil is also pretty good. Don't use Extra Virgin or any other 
  "unrefined" oil - they can't stand the heat. </li>
<li><h3>Temperature:</h3> &nbsp; 
  temperature at all times. Ideally keep your oil between 
  360&deg;F and 380&deg;F (182&deg;C to 193&deg;C). <u>It should never 
  smoke</u>.</li>
<li><h3>Don't Overload Your Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Fry in small batches so the 
  temperature doesn't drop too far or you'll end up with heavy, oily fish 
  with a steamed flavor. Small batches finish faster so it won't take much 
  more time.</li>
<li><h3>Draining</h3> &nbsp; Drain on a wire rack of wire basket set over 
  a pan. Draining on paper towels will end up with more oily fish.</li>
<li><h3>Clean-up:</h3> &nbsp; Clean oil off your stove as soon as possible. 
  heat will dry the oil into varnish which becomes more difficult to 
  remove with each passing hour.</li>
<li><h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Serve fried fish immediately as there is still 
  enough moisture in them to reduce the crispness. Small fish can be 
  re-crisped reasonably well in a 350&deg;F/177&deg;C oven - 10 minutes for 
  smelt, a little longer for larger fish.</li>
<li><h3>Re-using Oil:</h3> Oil degrades with use, different oils at 
  greatly different rates. Polyunsaturated oils (corn, soy, "vegetable") 
  degrade very rapidly and should never be reused, while Olive is 
  relatively durable. See the "IOS/OSI" column in our 
  <a href="../ingred/oilchart.html"><b>Oil Chart</b></a> page for 
  relative durability (IOS low numbers are better, OSI high numbers are 
  better). Oil that isn't yet tired and hasn't been overheated can be used 
  again (for fish only) within a reasonable time (tired oil foams a lot). 
  Heat it long enough that it no longer "pops", indicating all water has 
  been evaporated. Filter it, still quite hot, through one layer of plain 
  paper towel in a wire strainer. Store in a tightly capped jar.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tool">Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Fryer:</h3> &nbsp; The ideal device for deep frying modest 
  quantities of just about anything is the Indian 
  <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, similar to a wok 
  but with somewhat different geometry. The sides are wide enough and high 
  enough to contain most of the splattering and it requires a very modest 
  amount of oil to fry a reasonable amount of fish. They do a lot of deep 
  frying in India and can't afford to waste oil.</li>
<li><h3>Basket Fryer:</h3> &nbsp; The Western basket fryer is an efficient 
  and effective device but requires quite a bit of oil and tends to 
  splatter a lot of oil about, so be prepared to do clean-up, lots of 
  clean-up.</li>
<li><h3>Spider:</h3> &nbsp; A wire <a href="../ke/ke_spider1.html">
  <b>Spider</b></a> will allow the fish to drain well and quickly as you 
  remove it from the oil (photo to the left).</li>
<li><h3>Wire Basket or Rack</h3> &nbsp; Draining on a wire rack or basket 
  you will get fish with less oil than if drained on paper towels, which 
  tend to quickly get saturated with oil.</li> 
  
<li><h3>Thermometer:</h3> &nbsp; An 
  <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html"><b>Infrared Thermometer</b></a> is 
  ideal, but a thermometer with a long probe that goes up to at least 
  400&deg;F/200&deg;C can be used.</li> 
  </ul>
