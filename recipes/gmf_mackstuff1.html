You can serve this tasty mackerel as an appetizer, as a side, or as a main 
dish with rice. Give the first section behind the head to an experienced 
fish eater because it'll have the root bones of the fins in it. Mackerel 
is very perishable so don't keep it long in the fridge before cooking. It's  
loaded with Omega 3, but it's a little oily - a fish for people who like 
fish.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Mackerel:</b> &nbsp; Atlantic mackerel (also sold 
  as Norwegian Mackerel) is fine for this recipe being the right size and 
  having a robust but not overwhelming flavor. Pacific Sierra would be a 
  bit milder.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Oatmeal:</b> &nbsp; For this recipe i use steel cut oats, 
  John McCann's or Bob's Red Mill. If you use rolled oats or some other 
  kind you'll have to match the water and cooking time to suit.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Breadcrumbs:</b> &nbsp; A flavorful multi-grain whole grain bread is 
  best for this stuffing, sliced, dried (mostly) and crushed or chopped.

<h2 id="method" class=lrg>Method <small>to</small> Prepare, Stuff 
  <small>&amp;</small> Bake</h2>

<p>Clean the fish per method on our page 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and Filleting Round 
Fish</b></a>, then with your kitchen shears cut the fin off the top.</p>

<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake03.jpg" alt="Cut backbone" class=mrg>
With your kitchen shears cut the backbone as far forward in the cavity as 
you can, then do the same as far back as possible and once in the middle. 
Be careful not to go through the top of the fish. Actually, you can make 
a cut on both sides of the anal fin and go a bit farther back than the 
end of the body cavity.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake05.jpg" alt="Cut Ribs" class=mrg>
Mackerel is quite tender so cut the ribs off both sides of the backbone. 
If you rip the backbone out ribs and all like you can on some fish you 
may tear up the flesh too much.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake06.jpg" alt="Pull Backbone" class=mrg>
Pull out the backbone with a strong pair of pliers. You will probably 
want to use your fingers on both sides to keep it from pulling out any 
flesh.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake07.jpg" alt="Backbone is out" class=mrg>
The backbone should come out with very little flesh attached.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake09.jpg" alt="Pulling Ribs" class=mrg>
Now go in and feel around with your fingers to find all the bones and pull 
them out (lengthwise towards the center wherever possible) while holding the 
flesh back with your fingers so it doesn't tear. In particular, check for 
small bones up at the head end.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake10.jpg" alt="Ready to Stuff" class=mrg>
Your fish is now ready to stuff.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake01.jpg" alt="Stuffed" class=mrg>
Brush an ample sheet of aluminum foil with olive oil. Brush the fish with 
olive oil as well. Put in as much of the stuffing as it will comfortably 
hold.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/sf_mackbake02.jpg" alt="Wrapped" class=mrg>
Wrap the foil to seal as well as possible at top and both ends. Put in a 
preheated oven and bake at 375&deg;F/190&deg;C for 1/2 hour.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/gmf_mackstuff1e.jpg" alt="Cooked" class=mrg>
Serve in whatever manner you wish but accompany with plenty of lemon wedges 
for squeezing on the fish or with some <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/9jv_lemwfish1.html">
<b>Lemon Butter Sauce</b></a> (but don't drown it, just a little will do).
