  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 475&deg;F/245&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Score <b>PORK BELLY</b> skin side diagonally in both directions just 
    through the skin. You need a very sharp knife for this because the skin 
    is tough.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Fennel Seed</b> and <b>Coriander Seed</b>. <b>Thyme</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b> together. If using fresh Thyme remove leaves from stems. 
    Mix with the other items after they are goround. Mix all with 
    <b>Olive Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Rub mix into the scored skin side of the pork belly and let sit for 
    about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Set the <b>Pork Belly</b> on a roasting rack placed in a roasting pan.
    Slide into the oven and roast for about 20 minutes until the skin starts 
    to crisp.</li>
  <li>Turn the heat down to 300&deg;F/150&deg;C. Carefully pour 1 to 2 cup 
    of water (depending on pan size) into the pan. Continue to roast for 
    another 3 hours. By this time the fat should be pretty much rendered 
    out and the meat very tender. Of course, if you want more fat your can 
    cut the time some.</li>
  <li>Slice and serve. You'll have to slice along the score lines because 
    the crispy skin is too hard to cut through without breaking up the 
    rest.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; Select pork belly with skin on. 
  The more even in thickness the better. Try to avoid bellies with a 
  really thick area. Pork bellies are available in just about any 
  meat market that serves an Asian community.</li>
