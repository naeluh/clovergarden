Asparagus soups are pretty much always disappointing. Asparagus just 
isn't good for that, and trying is just a waste of asparagus, time and 
other ingredients.

<p>The flavor of Asparagus just isn't intense enough to base a soup on, 
and it tends to turn an unatractive gray green color when cooked. The 
one in the photo tries very hard, but has to use spinach to get some 
flavor and decent color, and goat cheese for interest - resulting in 
a passable spinach soup and a pound of asparagus wasted.</p>
<p>Where asparagus does work in soup is when you're making a light 
vegetable soup or something of that sort. Cut short pieces of asparagus, 
toss them in as the last item and give the soup 5 to 7 more minutes of 
cooking. Asparagus in soup works - asparagus soup doesn't.</p>

<h2>Updates, 2020</h2> 

<p>The above was writen back in 2008, after considerable disappointment. 
Since then, following a number of trials, we have found a couple 
Asparagus Soups that did not disappoint - appropriately used as light 
soup courses.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dov_aspr1.html"><b>Asparagus Soup</b></a>
    - (Spain) most asparagus soups disappoint, not this one.[v0]</li>
  <li><a href="vov_aspar1.html"><b>Asparagus Soup</b></a> 
    - (Sweden) elegant, rich, and flavorful soup course.[v]</li>
</ul>
