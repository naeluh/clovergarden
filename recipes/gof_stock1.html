<h1>Making Fish Stock</h1>
<br><h3>Everywhere</h3>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<p>Seafood soups can be very flavorful and well accepted, both at dinner and 
as buffet party dishes. They are not made often because of the 
inconvenience of making the fish stock upon which they are based. This 
page will show you how to make fish stock well ahead, when convenient, 
and have it on hand when you want to make a seafood soup.</p>

<p>Fish stock is made from the off-cuts when you prepare whole fish 
for recipes. It may also include other seafood, mainly shrimp shells 
and/or shrimp heads. Most recipes also include vegetables, herbs and 
spices, but I make mine plain because I usually don't know in advance 
what I will use the stock for. Those additional flavorings are easily 
added when the stock is used.

<p><img src="img/ke_stockpot01.jpg" alt="Stock Pot on Stove" class=mrg>
<h3>Pots:</h3> &nbsp; Of course you need pots - in various 
sizes. Keep in mind that a pot that's a bit too big is a minor annoyance 
- a pot that is too small is a disaster. I prefer light weight stainless 
pots with a thick multi-ply bottom, like the one in the photo. The thick 
bottom isn't needed for stock, but I can use the same pot for soup, 
where the thick bottom is often very desirable, especially if there is 
barley in the soup.

<img src="img/ke_filletset05h.jpg" alt="Cleaver &amp; Mallet" class=mrg>
<h3>Cleaver Knife, Mallet <small>&amp;</small> Kitchen Shears:</h3> 
&nbsp; These items have already been shown on the page 
<a href="../ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning <small>&amp;</small> 
Filleting Round Fish</b></a>, but are also used here. mainly for cutting up 
skeletons and fish heads. This set includes a razor sharp Chinese Cleaver 
Knife, a Soft Faced Mallet and Kitchen Shears. These tools are also very 
useful for many non-fish tasks in the kitchen.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/ke_stock03h.jpg" alt="Strainer, Skimmer, Ladle" class=mrg>
<h3>Strainer, Skimmer <small>&amp;</small> Ladle:</h3> &nbsp; These 
are all standard kitchen tools with many non-fish uses. The flat skimmer 
is used to skim off scum as it rises, just as the pot comes to 
a boil. The strainer is used to separate the solids (discarded) from the 
liquid, and the ladle for moving sock from pot to jar (it's hard to 
pour directly if the pot is quite full).
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/ke_bowl03c.jpg" alt="Large Deep Bowl" class=mrg>
<h3>Deep Bowl:</h3> &nbsp; Again, standard kitchen equipment 
unrelated to fish. You need this in the sink under the strainer when you 
strain the solids out of the stock (otherwise the stock will just pour 
down the drain, duhh!). Let the stock sit for awhile in the bowl so 
small solids sink to the bottom and fat rises to the top before pouring 
into the separator.  Of course, a pot could also be used for this.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/ke_oxofat1c.jpg" alt="Gravy Separator" class=mrg>
<h3>Gravy Separator:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the greatest kitchen 
tools ever invented. Yes, you can use it to degrease gravy, but mine 
is used far and away more often for defatting soup stock. No, you 
can't get as clean a stock skimming, only by taking an extra day to 
refrigerate the stock - unacceptable. Shown is the Oxo 4 cup, which 
features a rubber plug to help keep fat out of the spout. That blue 
strainer it comes with is worthless - the holes are too big and it's 
capacity is too small. You can safely toss it.
<p>The only deficiency of this device is the lack of any tool for cleaning 
the inside of the spout - and I'm pretty fussy about that sort of thing. 
I purchased a cheap bulb baster which came with a cleaning brush that 
works just fine in the spout.</p>
<p>Wet the plug and put it in before filling the separator. Let it sit 
for a bit for the fat to rise to the top, then pull the plug and decant 
about 2/3 of the contents. Replug and refill. Let sit, then decant again. 
For the last batch, pour slowly, watching the spout. Tilt up to stop flow 
the moment you see a bubble of fat enter the spout. Store the plug inside 
the bowl, not stuck in the spout, or it eventually won't seal well.
<br class=cll></p> 

<img src="img/ke_jar02c.jpg" alt="Jars" class=mrg>
<h3>Jars:</h3> &nbsp; I keep various sizes of jars for storing soup 
stock, most with the 3 inch opening, but some smaller ones as well. 
The photo shows a 4 cup, but 3 cup, 2 cup and 5 cup versions are also 
available for this size lid. I prefer lids with a safety dimple (barely 
visible in the photo) so I can be certain the seal is good. I wash my 
jars and lids well with a disinfecting cleanser.
<p>Jars from most commercial canned goods, such as sauerkraut, pickles 
and the like are made of heat resistant glass and will not crack when 
hot stock is poured in, though I give the stock a couple of minutes 
to cool below boiling. The only time I remember a cracked jar was some 
years back with an old Clausen's sauerkraut jar (but the stock was 
saved - it just cracked, and any glass chips would quickly sink to the 
bottom anyway).

<ol>
<li><h3>Buy Whole Fish:</h3> &nbsp; These should be fish suitable for fish 
  stock. You will find recommendations in the "Details and Cooking" pages 
  for individual types of fish. These pages are accessible from our 
  <a href="../ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page). In general, these fish will be light to medium 
  flavor and color with low oil content. Avoid dark oily fish such as 
  mackerel, tuna, bonito, etc.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Collect Ingredients:</h3> &nbsp; Set aside all your fish pieces 
  as you fillet the fish. Keep them well chilled while you work. You 
  should include Heads (with gills removed), Skeleton, any miscellaneous 
  Bones and Meat, and Fins. DO NOT include skins unless the "Details and 
  Cooking" page for that particular fish says they are OK. These pages 
  are accessible from our <a href="../ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties 
  of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).
  <p>You can also include shrimp shells and/or heads, and if you will be 
  including vegetables, herbs and spices, they should also be prepared 
  at this time for inclusion - generally chopped small. I don't include 
  vegetables and herbs at this time, giving me more flexibility when I 
  use the stock - these flavorings are easy to include at time of use, 
  which may be months later.
  </p></li>

<li><h3>Cut up the Heads:</h3> &nbsp; Refer to the photos at the left. 
  <p></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Make a cut with your kitchen shears right under the front of the 
    jaw to free the collar. Bend it back and use the shears to cut it 
    free from the back of the head. Cut it into two halves.</li>
  <li>Starting with the point of the shears in the mouth, cut the lower 
    jaw away from the head on both sides.</li>
  <li>Set the head upright and facing you with an accusing gaze. Place 
    the edge of your sharp Chinese Cleaver knife right along the center 
    of the head, between the eyes. Drive it through the head with a 
    soft faced mallet. Don't worry about brains splattering all over - 
    fish are not exactly intellectual giants - they hardly have any 
    brains.</li>
  <li>Give everything a final rinse, removing any gooy stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Fill the Pot:</h3> &nbsp; Put all ingredients in a pot, fish 
    parts, shrimp shells / heads if used, and vegetables if used. Pour 
    in cold water to cover the ingredients well. Bring to a boil 
    uncovered (otherwise it may foam over).<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Skim:</h3> &nbsp; As the pot starts to boil, use the flat 
    skimmer to remove any foamy sludge that rises. Some fish will 
    produce a lot of sludge and some will produce almost none.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Simmer:</h3> &nbsp; As soon as the pot is boiling, put it over 
    low flame and simmer slowly for about 40 minutes - at least 30 and 
    less than 50 minutes.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Strain:</h3> &nbsp; Arrange the wire strainer over the deep 
    bowl and pour the contents of the pot through the strainer. Discard 
    all solids.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Stand:</h3> &nbsp; Let the bowl stand quietly for awhile so the 
    small solids sink to the bottom and the oil rises to the top.
    <p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Defat:</h3> &nbsp; Using your gravy separator as described in 
    the "Equipment" section, remove the oil, and leave the small solids 
    in the bottom of the bowl.<p></p></li>
  <li><h3>Jar:</h3> &nbsp; Bring the stock to a boil, stand covered about 
    1 minute, then pour into jars as described above. Let cool 
    thoroughly and check that the seal is good. Refrigerate until needed.
    <p></p></li>

<h2 id="store" class=larg>The Storage Problem</h2>

<p>Fish stock is highly perishable, and keeps in the refrigerated for 
only a few days. Many suggest pouring stock into ice cube trays, 
freezing, then bagging the cubes for future use. Problem: the packing 
density of cubes is very poor, and your freezer compartment is probably 
already full.</p>
<h3>Solution:</h3> &nbsp; Here's what I do now, and it works 
really well, at least for me.
<ul>
<li>Make the stock (method will be found above).</li>
<li>Strain the stock, discarding all the solids.</li>
<li>While it is still hot, use your gravy separator to remove all the 
  oil. This is very easy to do - see the "Equipment" section.</li>
<li>Put stock in a clean sauce pan and bring to a boil uncovered 
  (otherwise it may foam over). Cover, and let cool just a couple minutes.
  </li>
<li>Pour into jars it will just fit into with 1/2 inch or less of air 
  space. Screw down the lid tight and set aside on the counter.</li>
<li>When thoroughly cool, check the lid to make sure the seal is good 
  and it's sucked down tight. If the lid has any spring, re-boil and 
  re-jar, maybe using a different lid. See the "Equipment" section 
  for more on jars.</li>
<li>Apply a sticker with what it is and what date it was made - no, you 
  are not going to remember. Refrigerate.</li>
  </ul>
<p>How long will this stock keep in the refrigerator? I don't know, I 
discard any that is approaching a year old - haven't encountered a bad 
jar yet (one sniff would tell you if it was bad). Of course, if you find 
a jar where the lid isn't sucked down tight and has some spring to it, 
it should be discarded immediately.</p>
<p>When you use some, you pry up the edge of the lid to break the 
seal so you can get the lid off easily (I use an antique Lucky Lager 
church key (most church keys sold today are too thick), but some 
recommend the pointy end of a spoon. If you have some left it must be 
used within a few days or reboiled and stored in a smaller jar.</p>
