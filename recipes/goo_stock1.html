<h1>Soup Stock / Broth - General Method </h1>
<br><b>Everywhere</b>
<p>Stock is one of the very most important staples you can have in your 
kitchen, useful for many recipes from many cultures. Unfortunately, in 
most kitchens, it is often routinely unavailable and inconvenient to 
make when needed. You can, of course, resort to commercial bouillon cubes 
or similar, if the list of ingredients doesn't scare you. Tropical 
Cultures without refrigeration traditionally used fermented flavorings, 
but have mostly converted to commercial cubes and powders. The methods 
presented here will help avoid that necessity, particularly in the 
matters of storage and availability.</p>
<p>What is the difference between Stock and Broth? Not a lot, really. 
Broth is usually defined as the liquid left from simmering a bird or a 
large piece of meat to be served separately. Stock is purpose made from 
off-cuts, bones and scraps of birds fish or meats. Either may be made 
with herbs, vegetables and spices - or not.</p>

<h2 id=store>The Storage Problem</h2>

<p>This is the most serious problem in having 
stock available. Writers warn that you can keep stock in the refrigerator 
for just a few days (true, as far as that goes). This is fine if you are 
constantly at work in the kitchen cooking similar things that use stock. 
For most of us, that isn't nearly long enough. Our lives simply are not 
that orderly.</p>
<p>Many suggest pouring stock into ice cube trays, freezing, then bagging 
the cubes for future use. Problem: the packing density of cubes is very 
poor, and your freezer compartment is probably already full. Years ago, I 
would freeze stock in the bottom of a saucepan, dip the pan in hot water 
to release the cookie and wrap it in plastic. A piece of the cookie could be 
chopped off when needed. Much better, but still a freezer space and 
accessability problem, especially with multiple kinds of stock.</p>

<h3>Solution:</h3> &nbsp; Here's what I do now, and it works 
really well, at least for me.
<ul>
<li>Make the stock (methods will be found below).</li>
<li>Strain the stock, discarding all the solids.</li>
<li>While it is still hot, use your gravy separator to remove all the 
  fat. This is very easy to do. (see equipment, below). The often 
  recommended method is to chill the stock in the fridge and peel the 
  fat off in the morning - a problem for scheduling and fridge space.</li>
<li>Put stock in a clean sauce pan and bring to a boil uncovered 
  (otherwise it may foam over). Cover, and let cool just a couple minutes.
  </li>
<li>Pour into jars it will just fit into with 1/2 inch or less of air 
  space. If there is too much headroom, just boil some water and pour 
  it in. Screw down the lid tight and set aside on the counter.</li>
<li>When thoroughly cool, check the lid to make sure the seal is good 
  and it's sucked down tight. If the lid has any spring, re-boil and 
  re-jar, maybe using a different lid. I prefer lids with a safety 
  button I can hear snap down. See Equipment below for more on jars.</li>
<li>Apply a sticker with what it is and what date it was made - no, you 
  are not going to remember. Refrigerate.</li>
  </ul>
<p>How long will this stock keep in the refrigerator? I don't know, I 
discard any that is approaching a year old - haven't encountered a bad 
jar yet (one sniff would tell you if it was bad). Of course, if you find 
a jar where the lid isn't sucked down tight and has some spring to it, 
it should be discarded.</p>
<p>When you use some, you pry up the edge of the lid to break the 
seal so you can get the lid off easily (I use an antique Lucky Lager 
church key - most church keys sold today are too thick), but some 
recommend the pointy end of a spoon. If you have some left it must be 
used within a few days or reboiled and stored in a smaller jar.</p>

<h2 id=gen>General Notes</h2>

<p>Most recipes presume you will make the necessary stock specifically 
for that recipe, just before using it. That isn't really practical, 
particularly if you are a "non planner" like I am. You make your stock 
when convenient.  Store it as described above and it will be ready, 
even months later.</p>

<p>I usually make my stock at least a little overly strong so it stores 
in less space - you can always add some water later.</p>

<p><b>Herbs &amp; Vegetables:</b> &nbsp; While most stock recipes 
specify various vegetables, herbs, salt, spices, etc. in the making 
of the stock, I usually use only the meats. The reason is simple. I 
seldom know in advance what recipe or even what ethnicity I'll be using 
that stock for - especially since it may not be used for months. Those 
additional flavorings are very easy to add at the time you use the stock. 
If you do include Herbs and Vegetables, and don't have a specific recipe 
to guide you, use a mix similar to that for 
<a href="goo_stock1.html#veg">Vegetable Stock</a>, but perhaps half as much.</p>

<p>Put the meat and bones in the stock pot and cover with water by 
an inch or two, depending. The stock pot should be brought to a boil 
quickly. Use a flat skimmer to skim off any sludge that rises to the top 
as the pot comes to a boil. Turn down and simmer slowly. The slower it 
simmers the clearer the finished stock will be.</p>

<p>The Chinese, to make the very clear stocks they often demand, cook 
the stock in a double boiler. With the outside pot at a simmer, the inside 
pot stays just a few degrees below a simmer.</p>
<br>

<h2 id=equip>Equipment</h2>

<img src="img/ke_stockpot01c.jpg" alt="Stock Pot" class=mrg>
<h3>Pots:</h3> &nbsp; Of course you need pots - in various 
sizes. Keep in mind that a pot that's a bit too big is a minor annoyance 
- a pot that is too small is a disaster. I prefer light weight stainless 
pots with a thick multi-ply bottom, like the one in the photo. The thick 
bottom isn't needed for stock, but I can use the same pot for soup, 
where the thick bottom is often very desirable, especially if there is 
barley in the soup.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/img/ke_oxofat1c.jpg" alt="Oxo Gravey Separator" class=mrg>
<h3>Gravy Separator:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the greatest 
kitchen tools ever invented. Yes, you can use it to degrease gravy, but 
mine is used far and away more often for defatting soup stock. No, you 
can't get as clean a stock skimming, only by taking an extra day to 
refrigerate the stock - unacceptable. Shown is the Oxo 4 cup, which 
features a rubber plug to help keep fat out of the spout. That blue 
strainer it comes with is worthless - the holes are too big and it's 
capacity is too small. You can safely toss it. <p>The only deficiency of 
this device is the lack of any tool for cleaning the inside of the spout 
- and I'm pretty fussy about that sort of thing. I purchased a cheap bulb 
baster which came with a cleaning brush that works just fine in the spout.
</p>
<p>Wet the plug and put it in before filling the separator. Let it sit 
for a bit for the fat to rise to the top, then pull the plug and decant 
about 2/3 of the contents. Re-plug and refill. Let sit, then decant again. 
For the last batch, pour slowly, watching the spout. Tilt up to stop flow 
the moment you see a bubble of fat enter the spout. Store the plug inside 
the bowl, not stuck in the spout, or it eventually won't seal well.
<br class=cll></p> 

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/img/ke_stock03h.jpg" alt="Strainer, Skimmer &amp; Ladle" class=mrg>
<h3>Strainer, Skimmer <small>&amp;</small> Ladle:</h3> &nbsp; The flat 
skimmer is used as noted above to skim off scum as it rises, just as 
the pot comes to a boil. The strainer is used to separate the solids 
(discarded) from the liquid, and the ladle for moving stock from pot to 
jar (it's hard to pour directly if the pot is quite full).

<p>Since this photo was taken, I've supplemented this collection with 
a large and a small Asian skimmer / strainer with extremely fine mesh. 
The small one is good for skimming when the pot is too small for the 
flat skimmer. Pouring into the gravy separator through the large one 
results in cleaner stock.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/img/ke_bowl03c.jpg" alt="Deep Bowl" class=mrg>
<h3>Deep Bowl:</h3> &nbsp; You need this in the sink under the 
strainer when you strain the solids out of the stock (otherwise the stock 
will just pour down the drain, duhh!). Let the stock sit for awhile in 
the bowl so small solids sink to the bottom and fat rises to the top 
before pouring into the separator.  Of course, a pot could also be used 
for this.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/ke_cleavmal02h.jpg" alt="Cleaver & Mallet" class=mrg>
<h3>Cleaver &amp; Mallet:</h3> &nbsp; These are needed only if 
you will be breaking up hard bones - vegetarians and piscitarians need 
not apply. <u>Never</u> hack at bones with a cleaver - you'll have bones 
and pieces of bone flying everywhere, perhaps even smashing the fine 
glassware your aunt Clara gave you (and checks on every year). Place the 
cleaver carefully, then drive it through with a heavy soft faced mallet. 
Split bones lengthwise, not crosswise, they are very hard to break 
crosswise.
<p>One of the stupidest pieces of knife advice I've seen is that "a meat 
cleaver does not need to be sharp". It needs to be very sharp, or it will 
skid off the bones sending them flying rather than bite in and crack 
them. It is sharpened <u>at a steeper angle</u> so the edge is very 
sturdy, but it is still sharp.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/img/ke_jar02c.jpg" alt="4 cup Jar" class=mrg>
<h3>Jars:</h3> &nbsp; I keep various sizes of jars for storing 
soup stock, most with the 3 inch opening, but some smaller ones as well. 
The photo shows a 4 cup, but 3 cup, 2 cup and 5 cup versions are also 
available for this size lid. I prefer lids with a safety dimple (barely 
visible in the photo) so I can be certain the seal is good. I wash my 
jars and lids well with a disinfecting cleanser.
<p>Jars from most commercial canned goods, such as sauerkraut, pickles 
and the like are made of heat resistant glass and will not crack when 
hot stock is poured in, though I give the stock a couple of minutes 
to cool below boiling. The only time I remember a cracked jar was some 
years back with an old Clausen's sauerkraut jar (but the stock was 
saved - it just cracked, and any glass chips would quickly sink to the 
bottom).
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p> 

<h2 id=chk>Chicken</h2>

<p>When I need chicken meat, I buy bone-in, skin-on, thighs (usually), or leg 
quarters - whichever seems most reasonable at the time (leg quarters produce 
more broth, less meat). I skin the meat, trim the fat, cut out the bones, and 
use the meat immediate or freeze it in a single layer to minimize damage from 
water crystals. All the bones, skins, off-cuts, and fat go into the stock pot. 
Yes, the fat too - much of the desirable flavor from fat is water soluble, 
and the fat is easy to remove later with your gravy separator.</p>

<p>For recipes calling for cooked chicken, I put the whole Thighs in a pot, 
skin, bones, and all, bring to a boil, then simmer for about 30 minutes until 
Chicken is tender. I fish them out, let cool, then remove bones and skin. The 
skin and bones go back in the pot to simmer another hour or so to strengthen 
the stock. 4 pounds of bone-in, skin-on thighs yields about 1 pound 14 ounces 
of cooked meat after skinning and boning.</p>

<p>Chicken bones, skin and fat should be brought to a boil with skimming as 
described in General Notes, then simmered slowly for 1 to 2 hours. If you use 
herbs and vegetables, put them in for the last 45 minutes or so. Strain, 
defat and store as described above.</p>
<p>A Caution: many years ago I was doing computer programming rather than 
cooking. On Monday I'd buy a big tray of chicken legs, toss them in a 
pot, simmer until done, then eat as many as I wanted. I'd strip the 
meat off the rest, and let the skins and bones simmer overnight for 
a very strong soup stock. Then several days during the week I'd use the 
stock and chicken meat with a little vegetables for chicken soup. The 
result was painful episodes of gout. Once I determined the source of the 
problem, I've used chicken more moderately and have had no problems at all 
(treat gout with celery seed extract, it's cheap and effective - used it 
on my last episode many years ago).</p>

<h2 id=cow>Beef <small>&amp;</small> Pork White Stock</h2>

<p>When I need Beef or Pork, I buy a big cut, bone in, and in the case of 
pork, often with skin and fat on. I cut these up for the meat I need and 
everything else goes in the pot, including fat, just as for chicken. I 
usually buy more than I need right then and freeze the rest. My tests 
find frozen meat loses no more liquid than non-frozen during cooking, it 
just loses it a bit faster.</p>
<p>Yes, more of a hassle than buying trimmed cuts, but you get all that 
really great soup stock this way.</p>
<p>If your off-cuts aren't sufficient for a pot of stock, freeze them to 
add to the next batch, or better, buy some meaty beef bones at the same 
time so you have enough - they're usually not too expensive. If practical, 
larger bones should be broken up - see Cleaver &amp; Mallet under 
Equipment above.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil with skimming as described in General Notes. Simmer 
slowly for an absolute minimum of 4 hours, but 7 hours or so is much 
better. If you use vegetables and herbs, put them in for the last 
45 minutes or so. Strain, defat and store as described above.</p>

<h2 id=lamb>Beef <small>&amp;</small> Lamb Brown Stock</h2>

<p>This is pretty much the same as the White Stock above, but first 
preheat the oven to 475&deg;F/250&deg;C and roast meat and bones 
in a roasting pan, turning several times, until well browned, but not at 
all blackened. This may take around an hour. From there, proceed as 
above.</p>

<h2 id=fish>Fish</h2>

<p>Buy whole fish from a reliable fish market. Here in Los Angeles we 
have a large number of very good Asian fish markets to select from. 
Frozen is OK (today just about all fish is frozen or "previously 
frozen"). Actually, whole fish is about the only way to be sure you're 
getting what you're paying for - especially in the more costly fish. 
"Substitution" is rampant in the fish market, and even in pricey sushi 
bars. Of course some fillets, like tilapia, are unmistakable, and I 
buy some for convenience, but I often want skin-on and/or to make stock 
where only whole tilapia will do.</p>
<p>Select fish that makes good stock of the type you want - fish isn't 
as simple as chicken or mammals. For suitable types see the 
"Details and Cooking" links from the various types of fish listed on 
our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
(very large page). For pictorial instructions on how to prepare fish for 
stock, see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish Stock</b></a> 
page. Shrimp shells can be added along with the fish for a more complex 
flavor.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil with the usual skimming as described in General Notes, 
and simmer for about 40 minutes, at least 30 and no more than 45 minutes. 
If vegetables and herbs are used, they go in with the fish. Strain, 
defat, and store as described above.</p>

<h2 id=veg>Vegetable Stock</h2>

<p>Here you have no choice whatever except to include the herbs and 
vegetables, or you will have naught but hot water. The recipe given 
here is a good basic stock. You can experiment with many other 
vegetables, but use a little caution - don't overload with a flavor 
you are not familiar with, and be cautious with Bell Peppers and 
Tomatoes, vegetables that tend to "take over". Some people use Onions, 
but Leeks make a more pleasant stock.</p>
<p>Remember, if you're serving vegan, you must be certain no animal was 
inconvenienced in any way in producing, delivering, or preparing the 
vegetables used (including packaging). Inconveniencing people (even 
though we are also animals) is not only permitted, but mandatory in 
the vegan lifestyle. This recipe makes 8 cups.</p>
