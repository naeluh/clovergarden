Live vinyard snails are not much sold in North America, but if you find 
them, this is how to get them ready for use in a recipe. They will still 
need a long simmer in court bouillon after this perparation. &nbsp;

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>SNAILS</b> in a large colander and place the colander on a 
    plate to catch the drippings. Rub the snails thoroughly with coarse 
    salt. This is very unpleasant for the snails and they will release a 
    large amount of snail snot to try to wash the salt away. Let sit at 
    room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, then rinse thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Repeat Step #1 two or three more times until the water runs clear 
    when you rinse them.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Snails</b> in a pot with water to cover by about 2 inches. 
    Bring to a boil and cook at a fast simmer for about 1/2 hour. At this 
    point the snails will smell pretty bad, that is normal.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>Snails</b> thoroughly under cool running water. They are 
    now ready to cook and will need at least an hour simmering in court 
    bouillon or per the recipe instruction.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Snails:</h3> &nbsp; I remember from my childhood an 
  Italian market in Easton Pennsylvania that had big tubs of live vinyard 
  snails out front. Some were always escaping and wandering around on the 
  sidewalk. Unfortunately, markets with tubs of snails are no longer 
  common in North America, but if you do find a source, you now know what 
  to do with them. If you catch your own snails, be careful they have not 
  been poisoned.  For more detail and an alternate method, see our
