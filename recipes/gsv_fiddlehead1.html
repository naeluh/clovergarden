The basic recipe closely follows one published by the Los Angeles Times 
test kitchen. My pasta variation makes more efficient use of an expensive 
ingredient.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fiddleheads</h3> &nbsp; These don't grow here 
  in Southern California, but, in season, some are available from high 
  end yuppie outlets, such as Whole Foods Markets (also known as "Whole 
  Paycheck Markets"). We have plenty of fern fiddleheads in a light 
  brine in the Korean markets, but that's a different fern and doesn't 
  taste the same. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fern.html"><b>Ferns</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pasta</h3> &nbsp;  Broken pieces of Bucatini or Mezzanelli will 
  match the fiddleheads well. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_itall.html"><b>Italian Long Pasta Shapes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
