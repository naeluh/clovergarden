A standard Euro -American side dish, generally served one per person, 
split open and with various toppings. The photo shows a Russet (left), 
a White Rose (right) and a White Rose that was baked wrapped in foil 
(not a good idea).

  <li>Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C (see <a href="gsv_potbake1.html#02">Note-2</a>)
    </li>
  <li>Pierce <b>POTATOES</b> with a sharp skewer several times about 1 inch 
    apart and moderately deep to allow steam to escape.</li>
  <li>IF desired, rub <b>Potatoes</b> with Olive Oil. This is usually 
    done, but the photo specimens were done without oil. Oils other than 
    Olive can be used.</li>
  <li>IF desired, rub oiled <b>Potatoes</b> with kosher salt. This is 
    sometimes done.
  <li>Do Not wrap potatoes in foil (see <a href="gsv_potbake1.html#03">Note-3</a>). 
  <li>Set <b>Potatoes</b> on the top rack of the oven in a single layer 
    and bake until done, about 1 hour for an 8 oz potato. Check doneness 
    with a sharp skewer - it should pass through without hitting a stiff 
    spot in the center. The ideal finish temperature a the center of the 
    potato is 210&deg;F/99&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Potatoes can be held hot for 15 to 20 minutes before slitting, but 
    serve as soon as you can.</li>
  <li>Make a lengthwise cut on the top side and squeeze in from the ends 
    to open it. Fluff the innards with a fork.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with butter, sour cream, or whatever topping you 
    desire (even just salt). Keep in mind that baked potatoes are not 
    fattening, but the toppings often can be.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Potatoes:</b> &nbsp; Russets are the recommended 
  potato for baking, producing a desirable light dry fluffy result. 
  Second best is White Rose which bakes out with a much more tender skin 
  and a little more waxy and less fluffy. For Irish dishes of any kind, 
  only Russets. The Irish will not eat any other kind of potato. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <b>Temperature:</b> &nbsp; Potatoes can be baked at 
  lower temperatures down to around 325&deg;F/165&deg;C if they need to 
  go in with other dishes, but will take considerably longer.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Foil:</b> &nbsp; Russets are almost always baked 
  naked, but some people wrap other potatoes in foil. This is wrong. A 
  potato baked in foil has exactly the color, taste and texture of a 
  boiled potato, so why bother heating up the oven for that?</li>
