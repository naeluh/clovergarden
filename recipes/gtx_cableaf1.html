Cabbage leaves are used in many countries, particularly as wrappers 
around a filling to form cabbage rolls, but also for other recipes.

  <li><b>Things</b> you will need.
     <ul>
     <li>A Large Pot deep enough so your largest cabbage can be held down 
       completely submerged.</li>
     <li>A strong sharp Prep Knife of pointed shape.</li>
     <li>A Wooden Spoon for holding the cabbage down and sloshing it 
       around.</li>
     <li>A strong metal skimmer (see photo) for lowering the the cabbage 
       into the pot and lifting it out. If your pot is fitted with a mesh 
       basket with a bale handle, that will work even better.</li>
     <li>A large stainless mixing bowl or similar device for transporting 
       cabbages and leaves from the stove to the sink counter.</li>
     <li>A good pair of tongs for removing leaves from the pot and/or pulling 
       them from a hot cabbage.</li>    
     </ul></li>
  <li><b>The Cabbage:</b> &nbsp;Many recipes call for one large cabbage head. 
     I prefer two medium heads (about 2-1/2 pounds each) for several reasons:
     <ul>
     <li>Smaller heads are <u>much</u> safer to handle.</li>
     <li>Leaves will be more uniform in size.</li>
     <li>Large cabbage leaves make rather bulky rolls.</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ol>
  <b><u>Procedure</u></b>
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Remove damaged outer leaves from cabbages and cut out the stem 
     core. Cut the core out out very thoroughly for two reasons:
     <ul>
     <li>So hot water can get at the stem ends of the leaves for more even 
       softening.</li>
     <li>Most of the larger leaves will come loose just by sloshing the 
       cabbage around with a wooden spoon in the core cavity. You can then 
       simply lift them out with tongs - <u>much</u> safer than having to 
       lift out the whole cabbage to pull the leaves loose.</li>
     </ul></li>
  <li>Put your largest cored cabbage in the pot and fill with water. This 
    is to make sure there isn't too much boiling water in the pot which 
    would overflow disastrously when you put a head of cabbage in.</li>
  <li>Remove the cabbage and put in <b>1 T Salt</b>. Bring the water to a rolling 
    boil on your hottest burner.</li>
  <li><b>Carefully</b> lower a cabbage into the boiling water. If you don't 
    have the mesh basket mentioned above, set the cabbage top down on the 
    skimmer. Insert the wooden spoon into the core cavity to stabilize it 
    and slowly lower it into the water.</li>
  <li>With the spoon inserted into the core cavity push the cabbage below 
    the water and start gently rocking it about. In about two minutes the 
    outer leaves should start to separate. As they do, pull them out with 
    the tongs and place them in the bowl. Inner leaves are too convoluted 
    to come loose like this, but they're probably too small by then anyway.
    </li>
  <li>If you find you need to lift the cabbage out, use the same method 
    as for lowering it in (but it will be a lot heavier) and lower it into 
    a bowl.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Stuffing</u></b>
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Check your leaves for flexibility. If any are stiff or have opaque 
    areas, just put them back into the pot of boiling water for a minute.
    </li>
  <li>Shave the thick center rib with a sharp knife so it's thinner and 
    flexible like the rest of the leaf.</li>
  <li>Set a leaf on the cutting board and spoon on 2 to 3 T of the 
    stuffing mix about an inch in from the stem end (see photo). Roll 
    the stem end over the stuffing, then fold in the left and right 
    sides. Finish rolling and set aside, seam side down. Repeat until 
    you run out of stuffing or leaves.</li>
