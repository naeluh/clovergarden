Bean salads are very common in Sephardic cuisine, and are more substantial 
than salads of just greens. This excellent version is from Turkey. See 
also <a href="hgp_bnegg1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BEANS</b> with 1/2 T <b>Salt</b> (yes, salt) for 8 hours 
    or overnight.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>EGGS</b>, either plain <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html">
    <b>Boiled Eggs</b></a> (25 min) or fancier 
    <a href="hsd_eggons1.html"><b>Onion Skin eggs</b></a> (6 hrs 
    simmer). Peel and refrigerate to cool thoroughly. </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 5min work)
  <ol start="3">

  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Beans</b>. Place in a saucepan with water to 
    cover and simmer until just tender - take care, beans vary. You 
    want them just tender through, overcooked they will start to fall 
    apart. Drain, rinse with cold water and set aside to cool, then 
    refrigerate to chill.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Salad</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min + 30 min chill time)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut <b>TOMATOES</b> into dice, about 3/8 inch, and drain them well, 
    preferably in a nylon strainer (drink the juice).</li>
  <li>Stem and core <b>BELL PEPPER</b>. Cut into squares about 3/8 
    inch on a side. I toss them in the strainer over the tomatoes to 
    encourage draining.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium.</li> 
  <li>Tumble together <b>White Beans</b> and all <b>Salad items</b>. 
  Refrigerate until ready to serve</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Dressing</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing items</b> items in a small jar so they can 
    be shaken vigorously before pouring. Cool.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Garnish &amp; Serve</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise in halves or quarters, and slice 
    crosswise very thin.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGS</b> into wedges.</li>
  <li>Dress salad and serve chilled, garnished with <b>Onions</b> and 
    <b>Eggs</b>. For buffet service the Onions can just be mixed in, 
    and the salad tossed with the <b>Eggs</b> just before serving.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle lightly with <b>Sumac</b> if desired.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Dressing:</h3> &nbsp; In France, salad dressings are around 4 to 1 
  Oil to Vinegar. In Spain and California they are  nearly equal, but 
  in Turkish and Sephardic practice they are relatively tart, even as 
  much as 1 to 2 Oil to Vinegar. Adjust if you feel you need to.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; The eggs can be plain 
  <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Hard Boiled</b></a>, or for fancier, 
  they can be <a href="hsd_eggons1.html"><b>Onion Skin Eggs</b></a>, 
  as in the photo.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sumac:</h3> &nbsp; This red flake is ground from 
  berries of a special sumac plant and is moderately sour. It is much 
  used as an herb or garnish in Anatolia and the Levant, so is available 
  from markets serving those communities. Many American sumacs are quite 
  toxic.</li>
<li id=04>
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; I made this Salad guided more by the 
  accompanying photo than the recipe text (tomatoes and bell pepper 
  weren't included). The photo seems to have been made according to 
  Suzy David's <i>The Sephardic Kosher Kitchen</i>. This version of 
  Piyaz uses sliced onions as a garnish rather than chopped onions 
  mixed with the beans, as some others do.</li>
