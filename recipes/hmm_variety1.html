A Passover dish very popular with Sephardic Jews of Morocco. They've  
all been driven out of Morocco, but still cook their traditional 
dishes.

<p>When used as a buffet party dish I cut the pieces a little smaller,

<ol>
<li>Rinse and drain <b>LIVER</b> thoroughly. Broil or grill so all liquid 
  drains away. It should be dry on the outside and cooked completely 
  through. See <a href="hmm_variety1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> for the reason. Cut into 
  1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Remove all fat and membranes from <b>KIDNEYS</b> and slice them 
  into chunks 1/4 inch thick about 1 inch on a side. Rinse well.</li>
<li>Rinse <b>SWEETBREADS</b>, remove any membranes and stringy things. Cut 
  into 1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Cut <b>COOKED BEEF</b> into 1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Rinse <b>TONGUE</b> in cold water, then warm. Place in a pot with 
  plenty of water to cover. Slice <b>ONION</b> very thick and add to the 
  pot along with <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until a sharp 
  skewer goes through the thickest part without encountering a tough 
  center. This will take about 1 hour per pound of weight. Remove from 
  the pot and peel off the skin as soon as it's cool enough to handle 
  (the skin sticks down if you let it get cool). Cut into 1 inch cubes.
  </li>
<li>Grind <b>CUMIN</b> and mix together <b>All Seasonings</b>.</li>
<li>Put <b>Chicken Broth</b> and <b>Seasonings</b> into a pan and bring 
  to a boil. Add all the <b>Meats</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer for 
  about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve with plenty of steamed white rice. This dish reheats very well.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Liver:</h3> &nbsp; Jewish law requires "koshering" a 
  thoroughly washed and drained piece of liver by roasting thoroughly 
  on a grill, or if that's not available in the broiler, on a grate so 
  all juices fall into a pan. It must be cooked completely through. 
  For a reasonably authentic flavor  we do need to broil the liver on 
  a grate, even if we are Pagans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_liverz.html"><b>Beef Liver</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; These have pretty much disappeared from 
  supermarket but are generally available in markets serving an Eastern 
  European community. For details and preparation see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Beef Sweetbreads:</h3> &nbsp; The original recipe calls for 
  <b>Brains</b>. While Calf brains are available in some ethnic markets, 
  I don't recommend them. Sweetbreads (thymus and/or pancreas) are a much 
  superior alternative (unless you are a zombie) and are more available. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_brainz.html">
  <b>Brains</b></a> and <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html">
  <b>Sweetbreads</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Left over roast beef is called for, but if you 
  don't have that just cut some beef into 1 inch cubes and simmer it 
  until reasonably tender.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Veal Tongue:</h3> &nbsp; These are often not available, so you can 
  cook a Beef Tongue (about 3 hours) and just use half of it. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tonguez.html"><b>Beef / Veal 
  Tongue</b></a> page.</li>
