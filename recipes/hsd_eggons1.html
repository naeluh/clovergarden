These eggs have been a part of Sephardic cuisine for hundreds of years. 
Called "Haminados" meaning "baked" they were originally simmered  
overnight in the ashes from the bakery ovens.

<p>Today, lacking hot ashes, these eggs are simmered very slowly on the 
stove top, or in a slow cooker. Despite the shells, color and flavor 
penetrate through into the yolk. For some alternate names 
see <a href="hsd_eggons1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.</p>

<b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (weeks)
  <ol>
  <li>Collect a bag of dried <b>Onion Skins</b> over a week or three 
    of cooking. Exact amount is not important, just that there are a 
    lot of them.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Fill a roomy saucepan (or Slow Cooker, see <a href="hsd_eggons1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>) half way with cold <b>Water</b>.</li>
  <li>Pierce <b>EGGS</b> and scald them 30 seconds in rapidly boiling 
    water (makes peeling much easier). Place them, immediately and 
    carefully, in the cold water. I scald the eggs 2 or 3 at a time, 
    handling them with an <a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html"><b>Egg 
    Spoon</b></a>.</li> 
  <li>Heap the <b>Onion Skins</b> on top, along with either <b>Tea 
    Leaves</b> or <b>Coffee Grounds</b> as desired. Add <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    and <b>Vinegar</b>, then add cold <b>Water</b> to cover well.</li>  
  <li>Bring <b>Eggs</b> to a boil over high heat, then turn to very low, 
    a bare simmer, for about 6 hours, adding boiling water if needed.</li>
  <li>One at a time, cool <b>Eggs</b> under cold water just sufficiently 
    to handle them. tap on a hard surface, then massage the shells 
    gently, just enough to crack the shell. Peel them. If you want them 
    nice and round, continue to cool floating in cold water.</li>
  <li>These <b>Eggs</b> are usually served at the Sabbath meal, for 
    Passover, or may be included as a garnish in salads and the like.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="1">
  <h3>Slow Cooker</h3> &nbsp; You can do this recipe in a slow cooker 
  instead of a sauce pan. Start on high, then turning to low when it 
  begins to bubble. You should add an extra hour because the slow 
  cooker will take a long time to come up hot.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Names:</h3> &nbsp; Italian Jews call these "Turkish Eggs". Greek Jews call them "Salonika Eggs" 
  (<i>Selanlik yamurta</i>) or "Jewish Eggs" (<i>Yahudi yamurta</i>).
