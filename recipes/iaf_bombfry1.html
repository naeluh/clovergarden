Do not be fooled - this "duck" does not waddle or go 
"quack". Described by my appreciative guests as "fish jerky", this recipe 
is for dried salted fish - if you can get the "fresh" (previously frozen) 
see our <a href="iaf_bombfry2.html"><b>Bombay Duck, Fried #2</b></a>.

This recipe is from the Parsi (Persian Zoroastrian) community in Mumbai 
(formerly Bombay). It is often served as an appetizer accompanied with 
lemon or lime wedges and beer. It can also be crumbled over bland dishes 
for flavor.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr / 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove heads and tails from <b>DUCKS</b>. Cut away all fins (see 
    <a href="iaf_bombfry1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> for a link to a picture showing where 
    to find     the fins). Cut each Duck into 4 pieces. This is easily 
    done by driving your prep knife through with a soft faced mallet.</li>
  <li>Wash the <b>Duck</b> well and soak in warm water for an hour or more 
    depending on thickness.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Salt</b> to powder in a mortar and mix with <b>Turmeric</b> 
    and <b>Chili Powder</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and chop fine. Pound to paste in a mortar 
    and mix with spices.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Ducks</b> well and rub <b>Spice Mix</b> into them. Let 
    stand for an hour or more.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> to a depth about 1/8 inch. Fry the 
    <b>Ducks</b> slowly over very moderate flame, turning often until crispy 
    and brown. If you see wisps of smoke, turn the heat down (It'll smoke 
    at about 360&deg;F/180&deg;C).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bombay Duck:</h3> &nbsp; This famous dried fish is sometimes 
  available in Indian markets (ones that aren't totally veg), but 
  increasingly from markets serving a Southeast Asian community 
  (labeled "Dried Latia Fish" or "Kho C&aacute; Khoai", or 
  "Cream Fish"). Yes, they smell to high heaven - don't worry about it. 
  Quantity given is for large ducks, about 10 inches long, or 7-1/2 
  inches with head and tail off. If your ducks are smaller use more of 
  them.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_bumaz.html"><b>Bombay Duck</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili</h3> &nbsp; Kashmir chili powder is a good choice - or 
  Korean if you don't have that. In any case, you want a chili powder 
  that isn't blazing hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
