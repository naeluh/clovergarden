Do not be fooled - this "duck" does not waddle or go "quack". This 
recipe is for whole "fresh" fish. For the dried form, see 
<a href="iaf_bombfry1.html"><b>Bombay Duck, Fried #1</b></a>. This 
hot appetizer is accompanied with raw onion rings, lemon or lime wedges, 
and beer.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 25 min prep + 45 min fish)
  <ol>
  <li>Filet the <b>DUCKS</b>. It's not hard, but a little different than 
    for most fish. For complete pictorial details on how to do this see 
    our <a href="../ingred/sf_bumaz.html"><b>Bombay Duck</b></a> page, 
    and  the linked Photo Gallery.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Duck Fillets</b> as desired, usually either two or four 
    pieces (see <a href="iaf_bombfry2.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Mix them 
    together and pound to a paste in a mortar or by some other means.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b>. Coat <b>Ducks</b> well and 
    set aside to marinate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Coating items</b> and pour onto a plate for coating the 
    fish.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Onion</b> into very thin rings. Prepare <b>Lemon Wedges</b> 
    (or <b>Lime Wedges</b>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> to about 360&deg;F/180&deg;C (see 
    <a href="iaf_bombfry2.html#04">Note-4</a>).  Coat fish lightly with the flour mix and 
    fry in batches until crispy on the outside and golden brown.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Onion Rings</b> and <b>Lemon</b> or <b>Lime 
    Wedges</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bombay Duck:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for whole "fresh" 
  (previously frozen) fish - yield will be nearly half this weight. 
  You need 6 or 7 fish depending on size. This famous fish is sometimes 
  available in Asian fish markets here in Southern California. For buying 
  and complete preparation details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_bumaz.html"><b>Bombay Duck</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; Kashmir chili powder is a good choice - 
  or Korean if you don't have that. In any case, you want a chili powder 
  that isn't blazing hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Semolina:</h3> &nbsp; [Rawa] &nbsp; The purpose of this ingredient 
  is texture, so use a moderately coarse semolina.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Some call for deep frying, some for shallow 
  frying. Deep frying is safer because this fish is so delicate. If you 
  shallow fry, you can use Mustard Oil if you wish (bring it hot to the 
  first wisp of smoke, then let cool a bit before frying fish). See also 
  <a href="iaf_bombfry2.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Details:</h3> &nbsp; The red onions go very well with this fish 
  and should not be omitted. This dish should definitely be served hot 
  if at all possible - even if you have to reheat in the oven. If you 
  deep fry, as are the example pieces, they will curl to the skin side. 
  Either quarter fillets or half fillets cut crosswise  will work. The 
  skin doesn't shrink strongly, but the flesh  has almost no strength 
  at all. You can pan fry in shallow oil for larger flat pieces (half 
  fillet - cut either way). Keep the oil fairly shallow so it doesn't 
  get on the skin side as you fry the flesh side. You must fry long 
  enough that the fish is cooked almost all the way through and the 
  underside is stiff and lightly browned, then turn skin-side down. 
  If it curls significantly, just pat it down flat.</li>
