  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (36 hrs - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>SOY BEANS</b> in water to cover well for 8 hours.</li>
  <li>Set up <b>Soy Beans</b> in your <a href="../ke/ke_sproutjz.html">
    <b>Sprouting Jar</b></a>, or other sprouting device. Rinse twice a day 
    to prevent mold.</li>
  <li>When most of the <b>Beans</b> have tails 1/2 to 1 inches they are 
    ready. If you need to hold them, refrigerate overnight or a little 
    longer.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Mix <b>Mustard Seeds</b> and <b>Cumin Seeds</b>.</li>
  <li>Measure out <b>Urad Dal</b>.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>Curry Leaves</b> from stems. Cap <b>Chilis</b> and break in 
    half, spilling as many seeds as will go. Mix.</li>  
  <li>Measure out <b>Asafoetida</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35+ min)
  <ol start="35">
  <li>In a coverable Kadhai, Wok or Saut&eacute; Pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    stir in <b>Mustard Seed mix</b>. When the Mustard Seeds start to pop, stir in 
    <b>Urad dal</b> and fry until starting to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Curry Leaves mix</b> and <b>Asafoetida</b>. Careful: the 
    Curry Leaves will snap and spit for a few seconds. Fry stirring until 
    <b>Chilis</b> start to darken.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Soy Sprouts</b>, <b>Water</b>. and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a 
    boil, cover and simmer until the <b>Soy Beans</b> are well cooked 
    and the water has almost all evaporated. This will be about 25 minutes, 
    and the beans will still have some crunch, which I like. To be more 
    tender will take more time and more water. You will have a lot of loose 
    skins, but they won't be a bother.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. See <a href="iap_sunsoy1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Soy Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very light colored beans that 
  are very fresh. Some are sold particularly for sprouting. I've had good 
  luck with Laura brand, sold for making Tofu. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_soyz.html"><b>Soybeans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Black Mustard is always used, 
  but if you don't have it, yellow will work. For details, see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Urad Dal;</h3> &nbsp; [White Lentils, Black Gram Dal] This is peeled 
  and split Black Urad Beans, which have many uses in Indian cooking. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis. Red:</h3> &nbsp; Japones are fine for this use. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; I eat this dish with steamed Sella Basmati Rice, 
  which gives a lovely contrast in flavors and textures. The most popular 
  Sundal is made with Chickpeas (Chana), but various other beans, peas and 
  lentils are also used. Street vendors in India serve it in a cone of 
  rolled up newspaper, a practice not encouraged by the FDA here in the 
  U.S. </li>
