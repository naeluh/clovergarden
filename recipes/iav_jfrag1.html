Some Konkani recipes just deep fry the rags and serve with a sprinkle 
of salt, but this recipe makes them more interesting. The fried rags 
would be an excellent crispy garnish too. See also <a href="iav_jfrag1.html#05">

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Obtain your <b>JACKFRUIT RAGS</b> (see 
    <a href="iav_jfrag1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Make sure clumps are cut or pulled 
    apart. Individual rags will stick together, but that's not a problem.
    </li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Batter items</b> using just enough water to 
    make a batter that will coat the Rags well when massaged in - not 
    too liquid.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>JACKFRUIT RAGS</b> into the batter until evenly coated, 
    pulling them apart so they are separated from each other.</li>
     </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a Kadhai or other suitable deep fry pan, heat <b>Oil</b> to 
    about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Place 1/3 of the coated <b>Rags</b> (for this quantity) on you 
    spider and dump them into the <b>Oil</b>. Spread them out quickly, 
    but no further stirring until the foam subsides. Most of the Batter 
    will shatter off the Rags and form strands and crumbles tangled with 
    the Rags. This is what we want.</li>
  <li>The rags are wet, so the oil temperature will drop below 
    220&deg;F/104&deg;C. Fry tumbling often until the Rags are getting 
    crisp and lightly golden. 
  <li>Watch the batter closely. As the temperature rises (don't let it 
    get over 350&deg;F) the orange batter will start to darken. This 
    happens suddenly. When it is brick red, no darker, turn off the heat and 
    quickly scoop out the rags with your spider. Drain on paper towels.
    </li>
  <li>Repeat exactly as above until all the Rags are used.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Jackfruit Rags:</h3> These are undeveloped 
  flower ovaries inside a jackfruit. You cannot buy these, you have to 
  get them when you disassemble a Jackfruit. For instructions 
  see our <a href="../ingred/mb_jackz.html"><b>Jackfruit</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Urad Dal Flour:</h3> &nbsp; You will probably 
   have to grind this yourself. I use my spice grinder to reduce white 
   Urad Dal to powder. It's not as fine as real flour, but does the job 
   well enough.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Kashmir 
   chili powder which is quite mild. If you don't have it, fake it up 
   with 1/3 hotter chili powder and 2/3 good Hungarian sweet paprika, 
   or use Hungarian hot paprika. For details see our 
   <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Flake &amp; Powder</b></a> 
   page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida / Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant 
  fennel plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. 
  &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida 
  beads or ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is 
  heavily cut with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure 
  asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" 
  form, and stir into temperings at the last moment. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I call this recipe "Konkani / California" 
  because the pattern recipe was imprecise and the ratio of batter to 
  rags seemed too small - so I used the same ingredients in similar 
  proportions, but doubled the quantity of Jackfruit rags. Speakers of 
  the Konkani language inhabit the central western coast of India, 
  centered on the former Portuguese colony of Goa, and between the Sea 
  and the Western Ghats (the steep coastal mountain range). Many 
  botanists believe the Jackfruit tree originated in the Western 
  Ghats. I have not found recipes for jackfruit rags from other regions.
