This recipe makes an appetizer with flavors intense enough to serve just 
warm. There are a number of steps to do but they're all easy, reasonably 
fool proof, and can be done well ahead.

    to smoke, then let cool for a minute. Fry <b>Potatoes</b>, tumbling 
    often until lightly browned all over. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>CORIANDER</b>. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very thin and chop fine. 
    Mix all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut into very thin slivers. Chop 
    <b>CILANTRO</b> medium. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a coverable saut&eacute; pan.. Stir in 
    <b>Spice mix</b> and fry stirring for a minute, then add <b>Water</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have real Mustard Oil, stir 
  1/4 t powdered mustard into the oil you are using. Mustard oil is the 
  traditional cooking oil of Bengal and north central India and Kashmir. 
  It is handled differently from other oils. Mustard oil is heated in 
  the pan with no other ingredients until it reaches a temperature 
  where the first wisps of smoke appear (about 440&deg;F/250&deg;C). 
  Immediately take it off the heat and allow to cool to a more reasonable 
  frying temperature (around 360&deg;F/180&deg;C) before adding other 
  ingredients. This procedure removes the acrid taste of the raw oil 
  and renders it quite pleasant. Mustard oil is available in markets 
  serving an Indian community. It will always be labeled "For Massage 
  Use Only" due to lack of FDA approval, based on reasons no longer 
  considered valid. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Half a Serrano will make this moderately spicy. 
  Kashmiris are not into high heat. Use your own discretion as to how hot 
  you want it.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This should properly be Kashmir chili 
  powder which is fairly mild. If you don't have it fake it up with 
  1/3 hotter chili powder and 2/3 good Hungarian paprika, or use 
  Hungarian hot paprika. For details see our 
   <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Kashmir garam masala is very 
  aromatic and non-hot. See our recipe 
   <a href="iys_masalgmk1.html"><b>Kashmir Garam Masala</b></a>.</li>
