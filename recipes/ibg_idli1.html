  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ days - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Mix <b>Urad Dal</b> and <b>Fenugreek Seeds</b>.</li>
  <li>In separate jars, soak <b>RICE</b> and <b>URAD mix</b> for at 
    least 8 hours, or overnight. Give them enough water there will 
    still be some left after soaking. They are soaked separately, 
    because they don't grind the same.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Urad Dal</b>. Grind in whatever device you are using, 
    adding water in stages until you have achieved a smooth batter that 
    is thick but just pourable.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Rice</b>. Grind as for the Urad Dal, until you have 
    achieved a smooth batter that is thick but just pourable.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Rice</b> and <b>Urad</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Place in 
    a container large enough for expansion to twice the amount. Cover 
    well enough to prevent drying, but allow some air circulation. Place 
    in a warmish place and let ferment. In the hot yeast infested climate 
    of Tamil Nadu, this may take as little as 5 hours, but here in 
    Southern California it can take overnight, or even longer, and in 
    cooler weather there is no wild yeast, so I have to add 1/2 teaspoon 
    of yeast to get it to ferment at all. It is ready when it is nearly 
    doubled in size.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Wet a piece of Paper Towel with a little oil. Wipe the bowls of 
    your steamer trays with the oil to coat very lightly. I do this for 
    my non-stick steamer trays too.</li>
  <li>Put half the <b>Batter</b> in a plastic bag and seal it, a Ziplock
    is good. cut a little off one corner and use it to pipe the batter 
    into the steamer bowls, just to the top of the bowl.</li>
  <li>Put water, no more than 3/4 inch, in the bottom of your Idli 
    Steamer. Bring it to a full boil.</li>
  <li>Turn the burner down a little so the boiling isn't too violent. 
    Place the tray stack into the steamer and put the lid in place.
    Wait for awhile until the whistle starts whistling well, then 
    start timing them. Regulate the heat so the whistle is steady and 
    fairly loud, but not too violently loud. The Idlis should be done 
    in 15 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Turn off the heat. Remove the tray stack and let sit for just 
    a minute or so, then push the Idlis out of the bowls.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, see <a href="ibg_idli1.html#08"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Reheating: &nbsp; See <a href="ibg_idli1.html#07"><b>Reheating</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Idli Rice:</h3> &nbsp; The official rice for idli is a very tiny 
  medium grain rice, which may be par boiled or not. It is sold as "Idli Rice" 
  (Idli Pulungal Arisi) in the Indian markets here in Southern California 
  and elsewhere. For other rice see <a href="ibg_idli1.html#10"><b>For Science!</b></a> 
  below.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Black Gram Dal, White Lentils] &nbsp; This 
  is peeled and split Urad beans. Its role in this recipe is to promote 
  fermentation. It is used in a great many Indian recipes so is widely 
  available in Indian markets, or on-line. <u>Use very fresh Urad</u>, 
  it should be pure white, not yellowish. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fenugreek Seed:</h3> &nbsp; [Methi] &nbsp; This seed is used by 
  many cultures so is widely available, even in many supermarkets. It's 
  place in this recipe is to promote fermentation. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_fenugz.html"><b>Fenugreek</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Idli experts recommend using a non-iodized 
  salt, holding that the iodine slows fermentation. I can't confirm 
  this is true, but I use Korean Natural Sea Salt, which is specifically 
  for use in fermenting foods.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Idli Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; In ancient times, Idlis were made in 
  leaves, but today, the Idli Steamer is universal, preferably with a 
  whistle in the lid. For details see our 
  <a href="../ke/kp_idliz.html"><b>Idli Steamer</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Grinders:</h3> &nbsp; In most homes in India, a 
  <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> is used. It is much 
  like a blender but optimized for mixing and grinding, rather than 
  making smoothies. If higher production is needed, or for really fussy 
  idli makers, a <a href="../ke/ke_wetgrndz.html"><b>Wet Grinder</b></a> 
  is used. If you have neither of these, you can use a powerful blender, 
  but grind in smaller batches.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Reheating:</h3> &nbsp; This is very easy. Load cold Idlis (including 
  if they have been refrigerated overnight) in the trays of the Idli Steamer. 
  Put some water in the steamer and bring to a boil. Set the tray stack in 
  the steamer and cover. After it starts whistling, wait 4 minutes and you'll 
  have nice warm Idlis. You can hold them warm by simply taking the steamer 
  off the heat.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Figure about 3 Idlis per breakfast serving 
  and 4 Idlies for lunch, with accompaniement. They are usually served 
  with one or two Chutneys, particularly a Coconut Chutney, or a Sambar. 
  When I first made these, I decided what I wanted was neither, but a 
  Rasam. I found one appropriate to the task. See our recipe 
  <a href="iov_rasidl1.html"><b>Rasam Idli</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Leftovers:</h3> &nbsp; There are so many wonderful uses for 
  leftover Idlis, you will want to make plenty of extras. Examples: 
  <a href="igg_idliyg1.html"><b>Idli in Yogurt Sauce</b></a> &nbsp; 
  | &nbsp; <a href="ibg_idlupm1.html"><b>Idli Upma</b></a> &nbsp; | 
  &nbsp; <a href="ibg_idlkai1.html"><b>Kaima Idli</b></a> &nbsp; | 
  &nbsp; <a href="ibg_idlman1.html"><b>Idli Manchurian</b></a> 
  &nbsp; <a href="ibg_podidl1.html"><b>Podi Idli</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>"For Science!"</h3> &nbsp; I tested several rices other than Idli Rice. 
  Here are the results:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Sella Basmati:</b> &nbsp; Made acceptable Idli, but, leftovers 
      did not work for pan frying. The chunks just fell to pieces and stuck 
      to the pan. Not nice.</i>
    <li><b>Thai Jasmine:</b> &nbsp; Considered "long grain" but meets the 80% 
      minimum amylopectin. Made acceptable Idli, but a little dense and a bit 
      sticky on top. They failed the pan frying test. The chunks all stuck 
      together into a big ball.</li>
    <li><b>California Rice:</b> &nbsp; [Kokuho Rose] &nbsp; These were quite 
      successful. Just a touch sticky on top and a little chewy when fresh 
      out of the steamer, but much less so when refrigerated overnight and 
      resteamed. They passed the frying test with just a little initial 
      sticking. This was completely eliminated with a light dusting of 
      rice flour.</li>
    <li><b>Thai Long Grain Sweet:</b> &nbsp; Hilarious! Puffed up, sticking 
      to the tray above. Spread out and stuck to the sides of the steamer. 
      Collapsed into a taffy like sticky mass. A big mess, very difficult 
      to clean up. Expect this same result from short grain Sweet Rice.</li>
    </ul>
