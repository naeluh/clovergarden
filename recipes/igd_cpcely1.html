Pachadis are similar to the Raitas of northern India, refreshing yogurt and 
vegetable salads. This one makes a nice dip, spread, or side dish - chili heat 
very adjustable.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "2 green 
  chillies", without mentioning how hot. Indian chilis are scarce even here 
  in Los Angeles so our default hot chili is the Serrano. They are hotter 
  than Indian chilis, so I call for just one. With most of the core removed, 
  this recipe will be mild enough for most people. 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Black Mustard Seeds are always 
  used. If you have only Yellow, they will work but pop more violently and 
  at a slightly lower temperature.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This very white dal is split and peeled black 
  urad beans (black gram). In India they are used both in bean dishes and 
  a very common ingredient in tadkas and temperings, so are easily available 
  in Indian markets. If you don't have them they can be omitted without 
  greatly changing the recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Bean</b></a> page .</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Chili,dry</h3> &nbsp; This will have almost no effect on the 
  hotness of the recipe, so use whatever small dried red chili you have.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee is easily available in markets serving an 
  Indian or North African community. Accept only Butter Ghee - Vegetable 
  Ghee is often deadly trans fats. If you can't get (or won't accept) 
  butter ghee, use oil. Avocado Oil would be best but Pure Olive Oil 
  (not virgin) will work fine. For details and a link to our recipe for 
  making Ghee, see our <a href="../ingred/oi_gheez.html"><b>Ghee</b></a>
