Raitas are often used as a cooling salad, contrast for heavily seasoned 
dishes. I consider this recipe excellent as a spread, but if I wanted a 
"cooling" salad I'd cut the amount of both chilis in half.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; (Mong Toi, Saan Choy) 
  Weight is for leaves and tender tips after removing large stems, because 
  steminess can vary. Around here it'll be about 8 ounces with stems. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar 
  Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; Indian chilis are scarce even here in 
  Los Angeles - most Indian groceries stock Serranos. These are fairly 
  hot, and around here they've become rather large, so I suggest just 
  half of one - adjust as you desire. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Red:</h3> &nbsp; Use small dried red chilis according to 
  your best judgement. Since this should not be very hot I use the common 
  Japones. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This very white dal is split and peeled 
  black urad beans (black gram). In India they are used both in bean 
  dishes and a very common ingredient in tadkas, so are easily available 
  in Indian markets. If you don't have them they can be omitted without 
  greatly changing the recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Bean</b></a> page .</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
