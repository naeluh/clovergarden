This makes a fine cold vegetable salad or warm side dish for a Western 
menu. In India a Kootu would be served hot as one of the accompaniments 
to the rice. The clams are more a flavoring than a feature ingredient.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; As you can see from the 
  photo, the Indian approach to bean sprouts is quite different from how 
  the Chinese do it (the ones in the photo are actually a bit 
  over-sprouted). Flavor and texture are both rather different. To get 
  this effect, take 1/3 cup of mung beans per 1/2 pound of sprouts (they 
  shouldn't be too old) and sprout them as you would any other seeds. 
  This takes about 3 days max. When they are sprouted enough you can 
  hold them for a day or two in the refrigerator. While the beans shown 
  in the photo are Mung Beans, same as for Chinese sprouts, In India 
  they sprout many different beans and peas this way.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This count is based on red ripe Fresnos and 
  will give the dish a very moderate chili bite. Red or green chilis of 
  your choice and quantity to your taste. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cockles / Clams:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1/4 
  pound cockles in the shell. Well, we don't have cockles around here, 
  even in the frozen seafood sections of the huge Asian markets - 
  closest they get are Manilla Clams - and they are absurdly expensive 
  for the amount of meat you get. I have chosen to use frozen Littleneck 
  Clam Meat which is easily and affordably available in the frozen 
  seafood cases at the Asian markets. If necessary, you could use canned 
  baby clams, though the flavor may not be as good. My recipe probably 
  has more meat then the pattern - I don't have yield figures on cockles 
  yet.</li>
