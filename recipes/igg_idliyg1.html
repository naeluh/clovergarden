<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Idli:</h3> &nbsp; These are small cakes of fermented Rice and Urad 
  Dal, very popular in South India and Sri Lanka. There are often 
  leftovers which can be used in various dishes, including this one. For 
  details see our <a href="ibg_idli1.html"><b>Idli - Rice Cakes</b></a> 
  Recipe</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; Use a plain, light, tart, full fat 
  Yogurt, not a bland or flavored one, and certainly not 
  "Greek Yogurt".</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I use an Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, 
  which are fairly hot. Use your own best judgement here. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; For the Garnish you can use the same 
  Chili Powder as for the seasonings, or can use Kashmir or Paprika, 
  which are milder and have a brighter color. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.
