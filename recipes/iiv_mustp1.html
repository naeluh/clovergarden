Traditionally this paste is ground with a <b>Sil</b> and <b>Batta</b>, 
similar to the Mexican <a href="../ke/mortar.html#stone"><b>Metate y 
Mano</b></a> (Aztec blender). Unfortunately the fine texture produced 
by this method cannot be exactly duplicated with common household 
machinery.

  <li>Soak <b>MUSTARED SEEDS</b> in warm water a minimum of 6 hours. 
    Drain well.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILIS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Mustard Seeds</b> and <b>Chilis</b> in a blender and 
    blend to a smooth paste, which will be flecked with brown and green 
    (see <a href="iiv_mustp1.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Stored in a tightly closed jar in the refrigerator it will keep for 
    a few days, but gradually becomes more bitter (see 
    <a href="iiv_mustp1.html#06">Note-6</a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; The mustard seed used in India is black 
  (actually, very dark brown), not yellow. <i>Bong Mom's Cookbook</i> 
  does suggest using yellow seeds if you want to cut the sharpness a bit, 
  and further suggests replacing some mustard seed with white poppy seed 
  if you need it even less sharp.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Indian cookbooks always specify 
  "green chilis" without giving any hint as to size or hotness. I use 2 
  Chilis Serranos with good results. The green chilis are supposed to 
  keep the paste from being bitter.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Dijon Mustard:</h3> &nbsp; This is from the 
  <i>Bengali Five Spice Chronicles</i>, which suggests using Grey Poupon 
  for best results, some Dijon's are harsher.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Powder</h3> &nbsp; This is from the 
  <i>Bengali Five Spice Chronicles</i>, which specifies imported Indian 
  powdered mustard, Swad brand or similar. The results probably wouldn't 
  be the same with Colman's.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Grinding:</h3> &nbsp; I was not satisfied with 
  the result of mechanical processing, so I ground it medium, then gave 
  it a good pounding in my big Thai granite mortar. Not as efficient 
  or effective as a Sil and Batta, but it worked reasonably well.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Storage:</h3> &nbsp; It is possible a little 
  vinegar may stop this mustard from getting bitter, as is done with 
  Western prepared mustard, but they don't use vinegar in India except 
  in the former Portuguese colony of Goa, but Lime Juice will probably 
  work too.</li>
