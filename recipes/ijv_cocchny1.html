This light, fluffy Chutneys is a favorite served with Idli in South 
India. It is also served with other items, particularly deep fried 
snacks. Very tasty, not too hot.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>COCONUT</b> into moderate pieces and place in your Mixie 
    or Blender. Grind fairly fine. You should have about 3/4 cup.</li>
  <li>In a dry pan, toast <b>Chana Dal</b> stirring until medium  
    golden. Add to the Coconut.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>SERRANO</b> and toss in with the Coconut. This Chutney will 
    be satisfyingly sharp by Southern California standards. Use half if 
    you want an unusually mild chutney - or use two chilis if you want 
    it scorching.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut the slices into threads, and 
    chop fine. Add to the Coconut.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Cumin seed</b> and <b>Water</b> to the Coconut.</li> 
  <li>Blend until you have a nice smooth paste, adding a little more 
    water if you need to.</li>
  <li><u>Tempering</u>: Break up <b>Red Chili</b> a bit. Heat <b>Oil</b> 
    and stir in <b>Mustard Seeds</b>. When they start popping, stir in 
    <b>Chili</b>, <b>Urad Dal</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b>. Carful, the 
    Curry Leaves will snap and spit for a few seconds. When Dal is 
    showing some color, take off the heat and stir in pinch of 
    <b>Asafoetida</b>.</li>
  <li>The Tempering can serve as an attractive garnish, or it can be 
    just stirred in right from the start.</li>
  <li>Refrigerated in a sealed jar, this chutney will keep for a few 
    days.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; You want meat from a Brown Coconut. It can 
  be fresh or frozen. If frozen, you may be able to get it already ground, 
  if so, use about 3/4 cup.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Split Bengal Gram] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Bengal Chickpeas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas Bengal / Desi 
  Type</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili</h3>	&nbsp; In India, this might be a Jawala Chili, 
  quite hot. That type of chili is hard to find in North America, so 
  here we use a Serrano, similarly hot. For me, one Serrano is perfect, 
  but some folks from the Frozen North may disagree. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seeds are always 
  used (except brown in Bengal), but the yellow ones will work if you 
  don't have black.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Black Gram Dal, White Lentils] &nbsp; This 
  is peeled and split Urad beans. Its role in this recipe is to promote 
  fermentation. It is used in a great many Indian recipes so is widely 
  available in Indian markets, or on-line. <u>Use very fresh Urad</u>, 
  it should be pure white, not yellowish. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
