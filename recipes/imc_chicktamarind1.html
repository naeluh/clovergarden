A richly spiced and delicious curry from the central coast of eastern 
India. There's a lot of ingredients here but it isn't at all hard to 
make, and would still be worth it if it were.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite size pieces.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>TAMARIND</b> as needed - see <a href="imc_chicktamarind1.html#02">Note-2</a>.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise, slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Spice Mix items</b>, leaving whole.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    chop fine. Grind <b>CORIANDER</b> and <b>SESAME</b> in a mortar. 
    Mix together all <b>Ginger Mix items</b>.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop medium.</li> 
  <li>Grind <b>Peppercorns</b> and mix together all <b>Tomato Mix 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>CHICKPEA FLOUR</b> until it is lightly browned. Mix with 
    1/3 cup <b>Water</b>.</li>
  <li>Cop your <b>GARNISH</b> ingredients to however you want them, any or 
    all of those listed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Spice mix</b> and fry stirring for a few moments, just until 
    aromatic, then stir in <b>Onion</b>. Fry stirring until light 
    golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger mix</b> and fry stirring until raw smell is 
    gone - about 45 seconds.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until all raw color is gone 
    and its fairly dry, being very careful the garlic sticking to the 
    bottom of the pan doesn't burn..</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>, fry stirring until fairly dry and oil 
    threatens to separate, then add <b>Beer</b> and again stir until 
    fairly dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind liquid</b> and 1 cup <b>Water</b>. Simmer slowly 
    until chicken is quite tender (30 min).
  <li>Stir in <b>Chickpea Flour mix</b> and simmer a couple minutes more 
    to thicken. Served Western style with rice it should be fairly 
    loose.</li>
  <li>Garnish as desired. Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><b>Chicken:</b> &nbsp; For Indian curries always remove 
  the skin and as much fat as possible. Weight given is for thigh or leg 
  meat without skin, fat or bones. In India, more likely a  whole chicken 
  would be skinned and chopped into serving pieces. If you use bone-in 
  joints bump the weight up to about 15 ounces (skin and fat removed) 
  and cut them into serving pieces. A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
  by a soft faced mallet is perfect for this. Chicken is very expensive 
  in India and reserved for special occasions.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 1 T, or if it's block use about 1 T, soak and strain. If you don't 
  have tamarind use 2 t lemon juice - not the same, but it's something. 
  For detailssee our  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; The given amount in Indian Reshampatti 
  powder makes this dish "wonderfully spicy" for those of us in the 
  Southwest who have <a href="../ingred/cp_heat.html">Paid Our Dues</a> 
  but may be devastating to many folks in the Frozen North. Kashmir will 
  be found much milder. Cutting down the amount, of course, affects 
  the flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chili Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many because some people 
  don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chickpea Flour:</h3> &nbsp; [Besam, Gram Flour] &nbsp; If you 
  don't have this use regular whole wheat flour. Either way dry roast 
  only until slightly darkened. The roasting is the same in theory as 
  frying flour in butter for European roux - it's to remove the 
  undesirable raw flavor.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Beer:</h3> &nbsp; It's actually supposed to be Palm Toddy, but 
  that's real hard to find even in Los Angeles. The supermarket on 
  Valley Blvd. in Alhambra and San Gabriel sometimes have non-alcoholic 
  palm toddy, but that's too sweet.</li>
