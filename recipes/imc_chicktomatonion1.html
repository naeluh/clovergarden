Aromatic and softly spiced this northern chicken dish is very flavorful, 
not chili hot, and will be enjoyed by those not acustomed to Indian food. 
It can be made well ahead and in several steps.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut the <b>CHICKEN</b> into larger than bite sized chunks (they shrink) 
    or see <a href="imc_chicktomatonion1.html#01">Note-1</a>. Fry in very hot oil until just barely 
    browned (joints and cut up whole chicken can be browned more). Deep 
    frying is easiest, but you can also pan fry. Fry in batches so the 
    chicken browns before it dries out - it doesn't take any longer than 
    frying all at once. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop very fine (food processor fine).</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise very thin.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop very fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>CUMIN</b>until aromatic. Cool and grind to powder.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Don't forget to have you <b>Chicken</b> already fried.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> (you can use 
    chicken frying oil if it's not burned) and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring 
    until golden. Stir in <b>Cardamom</b> and <b>Cinnamon</b> and fry a 
    couple minutes more, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stiring 
    until garlic starts to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Chili Powder</b> for just a few 
    seconds, then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Chicken</b>. Add 1 cup 
    <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer slowly about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check liquid and adjust as desired (more liquid for rice than for 
    bread).</li>
  <li>Let it rest for 1 hour to overnight if you have time. When ready to 
    serve, reheat, chop <b>CILANTRO</b> fine and stir it in along with 
    the <b>Cumin</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. Traditionally it is served with Indian breads, but I'm 
    just as likely to serve it with basmatti rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless and 
  boneless. If you're using joints with bones (skin still needs to be 
  removed and all fat) use 2.5 pounds. In India they would more likely 
  cut up a whole chicken into serving peices in which case you'd need a 
  3 pound chicken. Yes, skin and all fat still need to be removed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; Black cardamom is quite different from the 
  regular green cardamom. If you don't have black use twice as much 
  green cardamom - not the same but acceptable. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_cardomz.html"><b>Cardamom</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Kashmir is the natural choice. It is 
  a very mild and flavorful chili powder and the quantity given produces 
  a very mild dish. If you don't have it you can use a hot Hungarian 
  paprika, or use your own best judgement with your favorite ground red 
  chili. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
