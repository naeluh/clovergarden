  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min -or- 10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>Achar Masala</b>. See <a href="imc_chkach1.html#02"><b>Achar Masala</b></a> 
    for two recipes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine, Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    chop fine. Pound both to a paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Spicing Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Nigella</b> and <b>Mustard Seeds</b>.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> Using: Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE
  </b>.</li>
  <li>For Garnish: Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and cut slices into narrow strips.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hrs)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Pour off any whey on the <b>Yogurt</b>. Spoon into a bowl and whip it 
    until it is completely smooth. set aside.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart), heat <b>Oil</b>. &nbsp; 
    <u>IF Using</u> <b>Mustard Oil</b>, heat until you see the first wisp of 
    smoke, then take off the heat and let cool to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C 
    frying temperature.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Nigella mix</b> and fry stirring until mustard seeds start 
    to pop, then stir in <b>Asafoetida</b> for just seconds, followed by 
    <b>Onions</b>.</li> 
  <li>Fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring over medium heat until a medium blonde 
    color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b> and fry just until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Lower heat and stir in <b>Achar Masala</b> until aromatic, about 1 
    minute, then immediately stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Fry stirring until 
    most (but not all) liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spicing mix</b> and fry stirring for 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Turn the heat very low. A little at a time, stir <b>Yogurt</b> into 
    the sauce until it is completely incorporated. Turn the heat up a little 
    and continue to cook, stirring very often until there is little liquid 
    left.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and cook stirring until the raw color is 
    completely gone.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Hot Water</b> to loosen the sauce, but not to the final 
    consistency you want, as the chicken will exude water as it cooks.</li>
  <li>Simmer covered until Chicken is fully cooked, about 20 minutes for 
    chunks, longer for bone-in. Stir frequently. As it nears fully cooked, 
    add <b>Hot Water</b> as needed for desired consistency. Keep in mind 
    that there will be less water in it than it looks like there is while 
    simmering.</li> 
  <li><u>IF Using</u>: stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b> or <b>Pickle</b>. Take 
    off heat and let rest for a few minutes. </li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati Rice, Roti, or Naan.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless and fat removed. 
  Thigh/Leg meat has the best flavor and texture. In India this recipe would 
  usually be skinless bone-in chicken parts. I find boneless meat far better 
  for buffet service, and it would eliminate fighting over who gets which 
  parts at the family table. Do it whichever way you want.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Achar Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a pickling masala, but also used in 
  a number of stewed dishes, like the one above. We have two recipes for 
  this masala. <a href="iis_acharm1.html"><b>Achar Masala</b></a> makes 
  a cup and a half. The simpler <a href="iis_acharm2.html"><b>Achar Masala 
  - Quick</b></a> makes 5 Tablespoons, fine for two recipes of the size 
  given above. Recipes vary widely on amount, from 3/4 Tablespoon to 4 
  Tablespoons, so you can use the amount you prefer.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp;  Here you use your own best judgement as to 
  how hot and how much. It can be anything from Aleppo Mild on through 
  Indian Extra Hot or Cayenne. I use Kashmir or Aleppo Extra Hot for a 
  moderate chili bite. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html">
  <b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; You need to use an All Natural, Full Fat, Whole 
  Milk Yogurt. Low Fat Yogurts are prone to curdling when mixed into the 
  masala. Greek Yogurt may work but is more of a risk.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is traditional and gives the most 
  authentic flavor. Follow the heating instructions above, as this removes 
  the acrid taste of the raw oil. Other oils can be used, such as Pure Olive 
  Oil (not Virgin). For details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html">
  <b>Mustard Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Black Mustard Seeds are used 
  because they pop at a known temperature, but Yellow Mustard Seeds pop at 
  about the same temperature, 400&deg;F/200&deg;C.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Asafetida:</h3> &nbsp; [Hing] &nbsp; This is the resin of a large 
  fennel plant. Measure is for pure Auravedic grade. If using the more 
  common Hing Powder, use 1/2 teaspoon, as it is seriously cut with rice 
  flour. If you don't have it, skip it. This recipe contains plenty of 
  Onions, so will not lack flavor. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Pickle:</h3> &nbsp; Some people add 1 Tablespoon of an Indian Pickle, 
  Aam Ka Achar (Mango Achar), a paste like pickle made from unripe mangos. 
  Some people use just a little oil from the pickle, and others use no 
  pickle at all. Others may use Lemon Juice.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes for this dish are surprisingly 
  similar, but a few are quite different. Some modifications can be applied, 
  for instance one writer adds 1/2 green bell pepper, diced, and calls it 
  her "secret ingredient".</li>
