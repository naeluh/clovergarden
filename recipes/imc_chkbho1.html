  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati Rice, Chipatis or other Roti, 
    and with  a Raita (cool Yogurt Salad) on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for skinless boneless chicken meat.  
  I prefer thigh meat for best flavor and texture. In India, Chicken is 
  usually stripped of skin and all removable fat (except for tandoor), but 
  see <a href="imc_chkbho1.html#04"><b>Broth</b></a> and <a href="imc_chkbho1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; For some, the Green Serrano combined with 1 t 
  hot chili powder in two places may be too much. You may want to select a 
  mild one like Kashmir or Aleppo Hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili</h3> &nbsp; Availability of fresh Indian Chilis is quite 
  uncertain, even here in Los Angeles, so we us Serranos as the go-to hot 
  green chili. One Serrano makes this dish noticeably hot. Use your own best 
  judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; When preparing to do a recipe like this I buy 
  bone-in skin-on Chicken Thighs, then make a strong broth from the 
  skin, bones, and fat to flavor the curry. The fat is removed with a 
  gravy separator. There will be some left over for other uses.
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is based on one recently composed 
  by Pallavi Nigam Sahay in the Bhojpuri region of Bihar India, which she 
  named "Madhubani Chicken Curry". Mine is a little different in stepping 
  and treatment of ingredients, so I don't use that name.  She used 1kg 
  (2 pounds 3 ounces) of whole bone-in chicken joints. From the recipe and 
  photo it appears she used the chicken skin-on, unusual for India. I use 
  skinless, boneless chunks of chicken thigh, which is more suitable for 
  buffet service (and prevents family fights at the table). I add flavor 
  with a strong Broth made from the skin, bones, and fat. You could 
  also cut whole joints into smaller pieces using a sharp Chinese cleaver 
  knife driven by a soft faced mallet.
