India has become a world center for cooking European Cauliflower. It 
grows only in a few cool mountain valleys, so it's expensive, and chicken 
is very expensive in India too, making this a feature dish

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite size pieces.</li>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into medium size florets. Split any thick 
    stems for faster cooking.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CHARD</b> into narrow strips. Use leaf only, reserving the 
    stems for another use.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> and <b>Coriander</b>. Mix all <b>Spices items</b>.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok, kadhai or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> very 
    hot and fry <b>Chicken</b> until lightly browned, Remove from the pan 
    and drain on paper towels. Do this in two or three batches so the oil 
    stays very hot and the chicken browns before drying out. It won't 
    take significantly longer than doing it all at once.</li>
  <li>Pour out all but 1 T <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Onions</b> stirring until 
    translucent, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and <b>Spices</b>. Fry 
    stirring for a minute and then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. 
    Fry stirring until tomatoes are very soft and all the liquid has 
    evaporated, but there should be no browning.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b> until well blended. Then 
    stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Cauliflower</b>. Simmer covered until 
    Cauliflower is just tender, turning only a couple of times so as not 
    to break it up. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chard</b> just until just wilted.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless boneless 
  meat - with thigh meat highly preferred as it has much better flavor and 
  texture than the cardboard flavored breast meat sold in North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cauliflower:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for florets 
  broken from the main stems.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chard:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use the white stem 
  variety. Weight is leaf only without stems. Indian recipes often call for 
  spinach, but "spinach" in Indian is actually a beet green closely related 
  to Swiss Chard, so Chard makes the best substitute.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Reshampatti would be 
  appropriate, or Kashmir for mild, or Korean for in between. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; a good strategy is to do all 
  the prep and fry the Chicken - then start your rice and finish up the 
  curry when the rice is at least half done. The rice should have time to 
  rest (covered) for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
