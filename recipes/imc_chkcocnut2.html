A flavorful curry from Tamil Nadu, the southern tip of India. Note that 
chicken is very expensive in India and generally reserved for special 
occasions. This recipe can be prepared even a day ahead up to adding 
curry leaves and lime juice.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
I make this recipe more liquid than they might in India because for me 
it's not just an item on the thali, it's a main dish with rice so I 
like a little more sauce.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for skinless 
  boneless chicken meat - I prefer thigh meat for flavor. Chicken is always 
  stripped of skin and all removable fat for Indian recipes (except tandoor).
  In Tamil Nadu the chicken is cut small but still on the bone. Legs cut 
  crosswise would work well if you want bone in (use a sharp Chinese cleaver 
  driven by a soft faced mallet).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; Use an actual coconut if at all possible, I 
  prefer a fresh (white) coconut because the sauce will be less gritty 
  than with a brown coconut. If you must use dried grated Coconut 
  (unsweetened) soak it for 1/2 hour in just as much warm water as it will 
  absorb. Weigh out the needed amount after soaking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconuts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Poppy Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India white poppy seeds 
  are always used (available in Indian markets or on the Internet). Black 
  seeds will work, but it's rather hard to tell when they've been fried just 
  enough. This is a thickener and doesn't much affect the flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if at all 
  possible. American "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which is thick 
  and hard. Real cinnamon can be found among Mexican spices - the bark 
  is very thin. Real cinnamon originated in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), just south 
  of Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a southern 
  masala if at all possible. See our recipe 
  <a href="iys_masaltn1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Tamil Nadu</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Reshampatti would be right for this
  recipe, but others can be used depending on how hot you want this dish. 
  The given amount of Reshampatti makes for a noticeably spicy dish. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; There is no substitute, and 
  dried are rather inferior. Fortunately production has been ramped up 
  in North America and fresh leaves are now  available in most Indian 
  markets and on the Internet - but use caution, some people don't like 
  the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> page.</li>
