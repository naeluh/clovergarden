  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN</b> as desired (see <a href="imc_chkkar1.html#01"><b>Chicken</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut 
    slices into threads, and cut threads very fine. Place both in a Mortar 
    with 1/4 t salt and pound to a coarse paste.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHILIS</b> in half lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Dry Pan Toast all <b>SPICES</b> one by one, just until aromatic, 
    and perhaps darkened just a shade. Keep you toasting pan between 370&deg; 
    and 400&deg;F (190/200&deg;C). Let cool, then grind all together.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse. Measure is chopped and moderately packed. 
    You can chop both instances together, then divide into 1/2 cup (recipe) 
    and 1/4 cup (garnish).
  <li>Slice 1-1/2 inches of <b>GINGER</b> lengthwise into very thin 
    matchsticks.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a Kadhai or Wok (13 inches minimum), heat <b>Oil</b> and <b>Ghee</b>. 
    Over medium flame, stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until just 
    starting to take color, then stir in Garlic mix for just a minute or 
    so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat, tumbling 
    often, until it has completely lost it's raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spices mix</b> for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Seasonings</b>. Cook over moderately 
    high heat (a Karahi is cooked uncovered). Tumble the Chicken frequently, 
    scraping the pan to prevent sticking.  Continue to cook until Tomatoes 
    have formed a sauce that coats the Chicken. Center temperature of 
    the chicken pieces should reach 180&deg;F/77&deg;C or higher. See also 
    <a href="imc_chkkar1.html#09"><b>Cooking</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/2 cup <b>Cilantro</b>. Continue to cook, stirring often, 
    for about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> and <b>Ginger Matchsticks</b>, 
    along with plenty of steamed Basmati Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; In Pakistan, this recipe is most often made with 
  whole chickens, cut into small curry pieces (about 18). In South Asia, 
  Chicken is almost always stripped of skin and all removable fat (except for 
  tandoor). Here, this recipe is better made from bone-in skinless chicken 
  parts, particularly Drumsticks and/or Thighs, which may be whole or cut. 
  The photo example was made with rather large drumsticks, with the thin 
  end cut off. Thighs can be rather large, so it is good to cut them in half 
  crosswise. This is best done with a razor sharp 
  <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Cleaver Knife &amp; Mallet</b></a>.
  Breast meat is bland and stringy.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Sacrilege! &nbsp; A "real" Karahi is made without 
  Onions! Onions are now commonly used in restaurants, preferred by many, 
  and have even converted some Purists. Omit if you are a hard core Purist.
  "Purists will do anything to make life more difficult".</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be well ripened, brightly colored, 
  and flavorful. Commercial Tomatoes in North America are very often lacking 
  in these characteristics. If yours are, I suggest 4 ounces or more of a 
  simple Tomato Sauce be added.  My favorite is Faraon brand Spanish Style, 
  which comes in convenient 8oz cans, but other very simple sauces can be 
  used.</li>
<li id="04">
<h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes in English call for 2 Serranos, 
  as hot Indian Chilis are imperfectly available, even in Los Angeles. These 
  will contribute a sharp but moderate heat to the recipe. The photo example 
  was made with 5 yellow Aji Limo, which are hotter, but much smaller. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kalonji:</h3> &nbsp; [Nigella] &nbsp; This is not usually included, but 
  I adopted it from the recipe of professed Karahi Purist, so I'm sure it's 
  OK. For details see our <a href="../ingred/rn_nigelaz.html"><b>Nigella 
  / Kalonji</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Paprika</h3> &nbsp; If possible, use real Hungarian Sweet Paprika, not 
  the sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets. Hungarian has 
  much better flavor and a more intense red color.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you really control the hotness 
  of the recipe (which is supposed to be fairly hot). Allepo Hot will be 
  very mild, Korean Flake is variable, but usually hotter. Indian Reshampatti 
  or Khandella are quite hot. Or you can grind some of your favorite Dried 
  Chilis.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee contributes more flavor than Oil, but you can 
  use all Oil (or all Ghee) if you choose. Ghee is easily available in markets 
  serving an Indian or North African community. Accept only Butter Ghee - 
  Vegetable Ghee is often deadly trans fats. Otherwise Avocado Oil would be 
  best as it has a buttery flavor. Pure Olive Oil (not virgin) will work 
  fine. For details and a link to our recipe for making Ghee, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_gheez.html"><b>Ghee</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The trick here is having the Chicken cooked before 
  the sauce gets too dry. Too high a heat will leave the Chicken a bit tough, 
  especially Drumsticks, but since this is wet cooking, "overcooking" the 
  Chicken over lower heat does little damage. In South Asia and West Africa 
  they cook Tomatoes down until "the oil starts to separate". This, 
  they say, is to "remove the bitterness". I have never detected "bitterness" 
  in Tomatoes, but I do find that cooking it down that dry destroys the fresh 
  Tomato flavor, so I don't do it, authenticity be damned! This is probably 
  another hangover from knowing that Tomatoes are Nightshade Berries, which 
  were long cooked to detox. Also, I prefer the sauce a little more liquid, 
  so it flavors the Rice better.</li>
