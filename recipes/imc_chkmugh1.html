From the rich, warmly spiced Mughlai cuisine of northern India and 
Hyderabad. All or part can be done in advance, up to stirring in the 
Cilantro. The quantity is large (3 pounds) because it's most often a 
party dish. See also <a href="imc_chkmugh1.html#08"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into chunks about 1-1/2 inches on a side, or 
    as desired, but not smaller - or you can use half joints (see 
    <a href="imc_chkmugh1.html#01">Note-1</a>).</li>
  <li>Cut 4 oz <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Chop 13 oz <b>ONION</b> fine (see <a href="imc_chkmugh1.html#07">Note-7</a>). Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Heat a tava or comal rather hot. Roast <b>POPPY SEEDS</b> stirring 
    until darkened by no more than a shade. Pour out on a plate to cool. 
    Split <b>CASHEWS</b> in half lengthwise (a thumbnail into the big 
    end will usually do it). Roast stirring until very lightly browned. 
    Cool well.</li>
  <li>Separately pound to a paste, <b>Poppy seeds</b> and <b>Cashews</b>. 
    Both must be crushed very well so they act as a thickener. Mix and 
    blend in 1/4 cup <b>Yogurt</b> so it doesn't clump.</li>
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>Cumin Seed</b> and grind to powder. Mix all 
    <b>Spices items</b>. They are left whole (except the Cumin and 
    Turmeric) and can be removed before serving.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a 5 quart saut&eacute; pan or heavy bottomed pot, heat 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry, stirring over 
    decreasing heat, until the Onions are lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes 
    over moderate heat.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Spices mix</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Chicken is lightly browned. Make sure the fond adhering to the pan
    does not get too dark. It should be reddish. If it threatens to 
    go chocolate, go to the next step immediately.</li> 
  <li>Stir in 3/4 c <b>Yogurt</b> and 2/3 cup water. Scrape up the fond 
    adhering to the pan. Cover tightly and simmer slowly, stirring now 
    and then, until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Check 
    liquid, the onions will absorb a lot.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> for garnish. Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Poppy Seed mix</b>, <b>Garam Masala</b>, <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Lemon Juice</b>. Adjust consistency with boiling water as 
    needed (sauce should not stick to the bottom of the pan). It should 
    be more liquid served with rice than with bread. Simmer about 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless 
  boneless meat. I use the very convenient deboned leg and thigh meat 
  which has become available since the Russians aren't buying it up any 
  more. It has much better flavor and texture than the cardboard breast 
  meat sold in North America. The pattern recipe calls for 2 ea 3 pound 
  chickens cut up, or 5-1/2 to 6 pounds of chicken pieces. Skin and fat 
  are removed in either case, they are not used in India. This would 
  yield 3-1/4 pounds of boneless meat. I prefer boneless meat for ease 
  of service, but you may do as you please.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for homemade, but 
  that isn't practical for most of us. Do use an unflavored 
  <u>natural</u> yogurt (not "Greek").</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The standard Japones produce a 
  dish with almost no noticeable heat. Use de Arbols for more heat, or 
  according to your desire and best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; These are <u>very different</u> in 
  size and flavor from regular green cardamom pods. They can be found in 
  markets serving a South Asian or Chinese community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_cardomz.html"><b>Cardamom</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cinnamon:</h3> &nbsp; In India, real Cinnamon is used, not the 
  Cassia Bark called "Cinnamon" in North America. Real cinnamon is 
  available in the spice section of any market serving a Mexican 
  community. Cassia bark can be used if real Cinnamon is not available. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; This is an Indian spice mix, variously 
  made. It can be purchased, but is <u>much better</u> ground at home. 
  For a GM suitable for North India recipes see our recipe 
  <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala #1</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for grating the 
  onions. I have found that onions grated or run in a processor can get 
  very bitter, forcing you to fry them longer than you want to to fry 
  out the bitterness, so I chop them fine with a sharp knife.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally this dish would be served with 
  Naan Bread in the north, Basmati rice would also works well, or Jasmine 
  rice for Hyderabad (South India type rice is not common in North 
  America).</li>
