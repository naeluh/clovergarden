  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN</b> as desired (see <a href="imc_chksao1.html#01"><b>Chicken</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut 
    slices into threads, and cut threads very fine. Place both in a Mortar 
    with 1/4 t salt and pound to paste.</li>
  <li>Dry Pan Toast all <b>Masala Spices</b> one by one, just until aromatic, 
    and perhaps darkened just a shade. The chilis should be browned in spots 
    but not blackened (see <a href="imc_chksao1.html#10"><b>Toasting</b></a>). Pour them out 
    on a plate to cool. When cool, grind in a spice grinder, or preferably an 
    Indian <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> which will do the 
    whole batch at once in about 5 seconds.
    </li> 
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for garnish. Measure is after chopping, 
    lightly packed.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a 3-1/2 qt saut&eacute; pan, coverable kadhai, or wok, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> quite hot. Stir in <b>Cumin Seeds</b> until they are quite 
    aromatic but not burned, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b>, <b>Turmeric</b>, 
    <b>Chili Powder</b> and <b>Masala Spices</b> until well mixed. Stir in 
    <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until Onions are well translucent. Scrape 
    the bottom of the pan vigorously so the masala doesn't burn to it.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat for about 
    3 minutes, then stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Water</b>, bring to a boil, 
    turn down to a simmer. Simmer covered about 40 minutes, or until tender. 
    Tumble the Chicken now and then for even cooking. You may want to boil 
    down the sauce a bit for the last third of cooking, but not to far, it'll 
    firm up as it cools a bit.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>. Serve with plenty of steamed 
    Basmati Rice, Chipatis or other Roti, and with  a Raita (cool Yogurt 
    Salad) on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is made form bone-in skinless chicken 
  parts, usually legs, which may be whole or cut. For the example recipe I 
  cut off the thin parts and used them in the stock pot. I cut the thick 
  parts in half, all this with a razor sharp <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Cleaver Knife &amp; Mallet</b></a> to drive it through. In 
  India, Chicken is usually stripped of skin and all removable fat (except for 
  tandoor).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Dried Red:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is supposed to be Hot. 10 of 
  the standard Japone chilis barely gave the finished dish any hotness at all. 
  One Indian writer said he used half Kashmir (mild, probably actually Byadgi) 
  and half Guntur (quite hot and way larger than Japones). Gunturs are banned 
  from North America and Europe for excess pesticide residue. Another recipe 
  called for Patna Chilis, which are unknown to me. Both these recipes added 
  a substantial amount of hot chili powder in the final curry. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; This is much different, much larger, and 
  not interchangeable with Green Cardamom. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_cardomz.html"><b>Cardamom</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Cumin:</h3> &nbsp; [Shahi Jeera (India)] &nbsp; This is <u>NOT</u> 
   Kalonji / Nigella. often called "Black Cumin" in North America - and it's 
   not our fault. It's what the Bongs (Bengalis) call Nigella, and they got 
   here early.  Shahi Jerra is small, thin and sickle shaped. For details 
   see our <a href="../ingred/py_cuminz.html"><b>Cumin | Black Cumin</b></a> 
   page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Poppy Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; [Khas Khas (India)] &nbsp; In India it is 
  white poppy seeds that are used in cooking. In this recipe you could use 
  the black if you don't have the white. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/rn_poppyz.html"><b>Poppy Seeds</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Coconut, Grated:</h3> &nbsp; This must be <u>unsweetened</u> coconut, 
  preferably fine grated.  It gets toasted to a light blonde color.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> This is split and peeled Bengal Gram (Desi type 
  Chickpeas). For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html">
  <b>Chickpeas (Bengal / Desi type)</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Stone Flower:</h3> &nbsp; [Dagad Phool (Maharashtra)] &nbsp; This is 
  a signature flavoring of the Maharashtra region, also used in Hyderabad 
  and Tamil Nadu regions. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_lichenz.html"><b>Lichens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; In finishing the curry, I added 1 teaspoon 
  of Indian Khandela chili flake which is fairly hot, and it was barely 
  enough, probably scandalously mild by Nagpur standards.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Toasting Spices:</h3> &nbsp; While each spice is very quick to toast, 
  there are a lot of them, so it takes time. In Nagpur, enough would be 
  toasted at once to make several curries, and this would not take much 
  more time than a one dish batch. Keep you toasting pan between 370&deg; and 
  400&deg;F (190/200&deg;C) and pull off the heat if you see even a trace 
  of smoke.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Buffet Service:</h3> &nbsp; I would use skinless, boneless chunks of 
  Leg & Thigh meat cut into about 1-1/4 inch chunks. The amount of sauce in 
  this recipe can support at least 2-1/2 pounds of Chicken.</li>
