Spices and coconut make this stew aromatic and flavorful. Yes, stew is 
now an accepted term in India, for dishes that are too liquidy to be 
curries. Can invention of the spoon be far behind?

  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch chunks (see 
    <a href="imc_chkstewk1.html#02">Note-2</a>). Keep them in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CARROT</b> into sticks about 3/4 inch long.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut half the slices into thin

  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> fine. Mix.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for skinless boneless chicken 
  meat - I prefer thigh meat for flavor. Chicken is always stripped of 
  skin and all removable fat for Indian recipes (except tandoor). In 
  Karala the chicken is cut small but still on the bone. Legs cut 
  crosswise would work well if you want bone in (use a sharp Chinese 
  cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet). Chicken is very 
  expensive in India and reserved for special occasions.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for real New 
  Potatoes boiled in their skins, but these tiny, paper skinned potatoes 
  are almost impossible to get in North America (fingerling potatoes 
  have tough skins), and too expensive if you can get them. For this 
  reason I suggest red or white rose potatoes, peeling them and cutting 
  them into chunks. Don't use Yukon Gold type potatoes which turn to 
  mush if cooked a little long.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These are necessary for the true flavor 
  of southern India, and are now reasonably available in Indian markets, 
  at least here in California. If you don't have them you will have to 
  leave them out - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with 
  how many because some people don't like the resinous taste. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis, Green:</h3> &nbsp; OK, what does the pattern recipe 
  mean by by "Green Chili"? The most common green chili in India is the 
  Jawala, very hot. "Indian chilis" available in Los Angeles vary from 
  very hot to not so hot - so I suggest a Serranos or three green Thai 
  chilis (hotter but much smaller) - or use your own best judgement. 
  Remember, Karala is at the far southern tip if India, so this recipe 
  should not be too mild. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee is easily available in markets serving an 
  Indian or North African community. Accept only Butter Ghee - Vegetable 
  Ghee is often made with deadly trans fats.  If you can't get (or can't 
  accept) butter ghee, replace it with more oil (preferably 
  Pure Olive Oil). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_gheez.html"><b>Ghee</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds</h3> &nbsp; In India black mustard seeds are always 
  used, but yellow ones will work.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Cinnamon Leaf</h3> &nbsp; The thought that you could get a 
  cinnamon leaf in North America as laughable. The pattern recipe 
  suggests substituting a bay leaf.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if possible. American 
  "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which is thick and hard. Real 
  cinnamon can be found among Mexican spices - the bark is very thin. 
  Real cinnamon originated in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), just southeast of 
  Karala. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia Bark</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Best is a southern masala. See our recipe 
  <a href="iys_masaltn1.html">Garam Masala - Tamil Nadu</a>. Karala 
  and Tamil Nadu are back-to-back on the southern tip of India.</li>
