This is the source from which the famous Country Captain of the American 
Southeast and the English Country Captain were derived. This is a drier 
curry than either of those, and is still well known in India.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into largish bite size pieces or as desired 
    (see <a href="imc_ctrycap1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>)</li>
  <li>Crush both <b>GARLIC</b> and <b>GINGER</b> through your Garlic 
    Press, then chop fine to break up remaining fibers, or pound in a 
    mortar (better). Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mix all <b>Marinade 
    Items</b>. Massage into Chicken and set aside to marinate for at 
    least an hour.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr, depending)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. 
    Fry <b>Onion</b> and 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> over declining heat, 
    stirring more frequently, until uniformly lightly golden. Remove 
    half the Onions and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and stir marinaded <b>Chicken</b> 
    into the remaining Onions. Fry stirring until lightly browned. Be 
    careful the fond sticking to the pan doesn't burn. It can be reddish, 
    but if it tends to chocolate go on to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li> Stir in <b>Stock</b>.  Bring to boil, cover, and simmer 30 to 
    40 minutes or until chicken is tender, longer if bone-in.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid if needed. This curry should not have a lot of 
    free liquid, but it should have some. Stir in <b>Reserved Onions</b> 
    until well heated.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Cilantro</b>, and with plenty 
    of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for skinless, boneless and 
  trimmed of fat. You can use bone-in joints, with legs and thighs cut 
  in pieces (use a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced 
  mallet) You will need about 2-1/2 pounds. They must be skinless as 
  skin and fat are not used in India. I use leg and thigh meat for better 
  flavor and texture than the cardboard breasts we get around here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I use Khandela or Reshampatti, both 
  hotter than Kashmir but less hot than Cayenne. This makes the 
  dish "satisfyingly spicy" by Southern California standards. If in 
  doubt, use Kashmir powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Los Angeles we can not always get 
  "Indian Chilis" that are as hot as in India, but one Serrano will do 
  the job, or, if in doubt, seed the serrano. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In India this may have originally been Ghee or 
  Mustard Oil, depending on region. I use Pure Olive Oil, which 
  &uuml;ber expert Julie Sahni has declared fine for all Indian cooking 
  (except where ghee or mustard oil are distinctly called for). She says 
  it is increasingly used in India as it westernizes.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Historical Notes:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is 
  probably named for captains of India based ships called "country ships" 
  during the Raj, thus "Country Captain". It could also be named after 
  an Indian native serving as a captain in the British army, also a 
  "Country Captain", but its prominence in American and English seaports 
  suggests the nautical origin. Anglo-Indian Country Captain (as made in 
  India) is a drier curry than either the American or English, but it's 
  still basically fried chicken with curry spices and lots of onions. 
  In England it is made with stock and soured with lemon or lime, while 
  in the American south it is made using tomatoes. In keeping with 
  Indian practice, the chicken is skinless and the dish is served with 
  steamed long grain rice. In England and America The rice was probably 
  originally Carolina Rice, once a major export from America, but exports 
  did not recover from  the Civil War. I recommend Thai Jasmine rice for 
  those versions, but for this Indian version Basmati rice would be 
  preferred. Of course, Jasmine rice (formerly called "Thai Basmati") 
  could be used here too.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; There is no standard 
  recipe, everyone's grandmother did it a little different. This recipe 
  was composed after studying several authentic sources. Indian writers 
  all declare their grandmothers would be horrified at using anything but 
  the freshest ingredients, yet they all call for using Garlic paste 
  and Ginger paste out of jars, a shortcut very standard in India 
  today. Those are inferior products and I won't stand for them. 
  Because my usage is different from India, this will probably be the 
  only dish accompanying my rice, so I prefer it with a little more 
  liquid than is done in India.</li>
