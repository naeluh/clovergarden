Delicious and fiery. Goa is the port through which Portuguese sailors 
introduced chili peppers to India. Recipes labeled "Goa" tend to be 
hot, and this one doesnt disappoint. If you haven't made peace with the 
Chili Gods, use caution.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr / 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inch on a side by whatever 
    thickness your fish is. Tumble the pieces with <b>Lemon Juice</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Set aside for 1 hour or so.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold  
    water, peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Split <b>GREEN CHILIS</b> open lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>TAMARIND</b> if using block form (see 
    <a href="imf_fishgoa1.html#03">Note-3</a>).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Mix and smash to paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>COCONUT</b> and chop as fine as you can get it. Pound it 
    to paste in a mortar - or use whatever means you have available.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>Dry Chilis</b>, break in half and dump out any seeds that will 
    come out. Grind along with <b>Coriander Seeds</b> and <b>Cumin Seeds</b> 
    in your spice grinder.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Coconut Paste items</b>. Run it all in a 
    blender if you didn't get it pounded pasty enough.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onions</b> stirring until golden. Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry 
    stirring until tomatoes are quite soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Paste</b> and 1 c <b>Water</b>. Simmer another 10 
    minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting water as needed. 
    It should be fairly liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Green Chilis</b>, then gently stir in <b>Fish</b> and 
    arrange evenly. Cover and simmer until fish is done (do not stir), about 
    8 minutes depending on thickness.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="2">
  <h3>Chilis, Green:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 
  4 green chilis. These would be Indian chilis which are narrow, 
  thin walled and quite hot - but chilis called "Indian Chilis" here 
  in Los Angeles are sometimes not nearly hot enough, and often not 
  available. I substitute Serranos, which are wider and thick walled, 
  but are reliably hot and alwasys available. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Use concentrate, or prepare block form as 
  described on our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh if possible. Weight is for fresh or 
  frozen coconut. I prefer a "fresh" coconut which is like the dry ones 
  but white instead of brown. The flesh pops out of the shelleasily and 
  grates easier, and the water is more flavorful for drinking. If fresh 
  or frozen aren't available use 1 cup of dried grated coconut 
  (unsweetened) and soak with enough water to cover. Drain before 
  using. For details on handling coconuts, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconuts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis Dry:</h3> &nbsp; I use dried Arbols. If you want less hot 
  use Japones. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
