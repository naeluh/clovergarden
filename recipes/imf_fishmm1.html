Outstandingly flavorful, this dish will be loved by anyone who likes 
spicy food. It takes a bit of effort to make it, but the harder steps 
can be done a day in advance. "Meen" is a common Indian word for 
"fish" - as for "Moily", see <a href="imf_fishmm1.html#06">Note-6</a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inch on a side by whatever 
    thickness your fish is. Tumble the pieces with <b>Lemon Juice</b> and 
    set aside for 1/2 hour or so.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold
    water, peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Put all <b>Coconut Paste items</b> <u>except</u> <b>Coconut</b> in 
    a small pan and fry stirring over moderate heat until chilis darken 
    and mustard seeds are popping - do not burn the chilis! Cool 
    thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>COCONUT</b> and chop as fine as you can get it. Pound it 
    in a mortar, then mix with <b>Coconut Paste items</b> and pound to 
    paste - or use whatever means you have available.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>TAMARIND</b> if using block form (see <a href="imf_fishmm1.html#03">Note-3</a>).
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for recipe (or use Curry Leaves, see 
    <a href="imf_fishmm1.html#05">Note-5</a>). Pull <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves from stems 
    for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">kadhai</a>, wok or iron skillet, 
    heat sufficient <b>Oil</b> to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C and fry fish lightly. 
    Do a few pieces at a time so they fry quickly and aren't crowded. Drain 
    and set aside (can be done in advance).</li> 
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> (you can use 
    fish fry oil) and fry <b>Onions</b> until lightly browned. Stir in 
    <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Turmeric</b> and fry stirring until tomatoes 
    are quite soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind</b> and 2/3 c <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Paste</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer another 10 
    minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting water as needed. It 
    should not be too dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cilantro</b> (or Curry Leaves), then gently stir in 
    <b>Fish</b>. Simmer until fish is done, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> leaves and along with plenty 
    of steamed Basmati or Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I use dried de Arbols or Thai Chilis. If you 
  want less hot use Japones. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh if possible. Weight is for fresh 
  or frozen coconut. I prefer a "fresh" coconut which is like the dry 
  ones but white instead of brown. The flesh pops out of the shell easily 
  and grates easier, and the water is more flavorful for drinking. If 
  fresh or frozen aren't available use 2/3 cup of dried grated coconut 
  (unsweetened) and soak with enough water to make up 1 cup. Drain before 
  using. For details on handling coconuts, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconut</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 1 T, or if it's block use about 1 T, soak and strain. If you 
  don't have tamarind use 2 t lemon juice - not the same, but it's 
  something. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">Tamarind</a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe (published in India - see 
  <a href="biblio.html">bibliography</a> reference imp) calls for 
  Cilantro in the ingredients and Curry Leaves in the text, and the 
  photo shows curry leaves (unlike many Indian recipes, the photo 
  actually more or less resembles what the recipe produces). I'm not 
  going to be too hard on the Indians here, inconsistency may be a habit 
  they picked up from English cookbooks. Meen Moily recipes on the 
  Internet that are cribbed from the source book (some display the book's 
  photo upside down, attempting to conceal its origin) call for Cilantro. 
  Other recipes call for curry leaves (from 4 to 30 or so). While I have 
  easy access to curry leaves, most in North America don't, so I'm 
  leaving it up to you. Use curry leaves if you have them (and like them) 
  - it'll be more "authentic". For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Moily:</h3> &nbsp; The story from India is that when Portuguese 
  sailors came to Karala they were served a dish too hot for them to 
  handle. It was toned down for them by a lady named Moily by adding 
  coconut. This story is <u>highly suspect</u>. It was those Portuguese 
  sailors who brought hot chilis to India (and most of the rest of the 
  world), and they were real fire eaters - see 
  <a href="imm_pigvinda1.html"><b>Pork Vindaloo</b></a> and other 
  recipes from the Portuguese port colony of Goa.</li>
