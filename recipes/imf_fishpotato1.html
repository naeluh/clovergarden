This is a very popular dish on the east coast of India. variously made. 
I composed this recipe from several versions, and am quite happy with it.

  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inch on a side, larger if 
    you use carp (see <a href="imf_fishpotato1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). IF you will be 
    frying the  fish (see <a href="imf_fishpotato1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>), rub with 
    <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Set Aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold water

  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. pound to a paste in a 
    mortar.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>DRY CHILIS</b> and break in half, dumping out as many seeds as 
    will dump out. Grind along with <b>Coriander</b> and <b>Cumin</b> in 
    your spice grinder. Mix all <b>Spicing mix items</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Medium potatoes like White Rose work well 
  here.  See our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potato 
  Page</b></a> for details. Note that the acid in the tomatoes firms 
  the outside of the potatoes resulting in sharp edged cubes and no 
  thickening of the sauce. If you wish to avoid this, half cook the 
  potatoes in water. Drain and set aside until needed. Add as above 
  and shorten the 20 cooking time some.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis, Green:</h3> &nbsp; Two Serrano split from under the 
  cap to the tip add just enough hotness to be noticed. Feel free to 
  use more if you like, less, or even none.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; I use Arbols, but if you 
  want less hot use Japones. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of 
  much use. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bay Leaves</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for 2 Bay Leaves in 
  place of the Curry Leaves.  This may be presuming curry leaves are 
  not available - Andhra is far enough south to be in curry eaf 
  territory. Of course, if you don't have them, or don't like the 
  resinous taste, you can use Bay Leaves. While Indian Bay Leaves 
  are not much available in North America, the closely related 
  Mediterranean bay leaves are suitable.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp;  Indian recipes of this sort very often have 
  you dust the fish and sometimes the potatoes lightly with a little 
  salt and turmeric, then fry them separately until light golden. This 
  step does provide a unique flavor but also adds complexity. It can 
  be skipped without ruining the dish, but it's well worth the while if 
  you can take the time.</li>
