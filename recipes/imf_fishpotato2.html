Fish curries are very popular in eastern India. This one is from West 
Bengal on the northeast coast. See <a href="imf_fishpotato1.html">
<b>Fish &amp; Potato Curry</b></a> for a version from farther south, 
and <a href="imf_fishpotato2.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> on method.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces, about 2-1/2 by 1-1/2 inches. Use rather 
   large pieces if you use carp (see <a href="imf_fishpotato2.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). 
   IF you will be frying the fish (see <a href="imf_fishpotato2.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>) 
   rub with <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Set Aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into small florettes.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANT</b> into 1 inch cubes, Hold in water acidulated with 
    a little citric acid or lemon juice until needed. </li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Mix and pound to a paste in a large mortar (or use a 
    mini-prep processor).</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b>, <b>Mustard Seed</b> and <b>Coriander Seed</b> 
    in a spice grinder. Mix all <b>Spices items</b> and blend into 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Split <b>CHILIS</b> lengthwise from just under the caps to the tips. 
    Remove seed and veins only to the extent you want to control hotness.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Option, see <a href="imf_fishpotato2.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> - heat 4 T <b>Oil</b> 
    in a well seasoned iron skillet and fry fish over moderate heat 
    until lightly browned on both sides. Remove from the oil and drain 
    on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Measure 2 Tablespoons of the <b>Oil</b> into a coverable saut&eacute; 
    pan and heat over moderate flame. Fry <b>Nigella Seeds</b> for about 15 
    seconds, then stir in <b>Aromatics mix</b>. Fry stirring for a 
    few minutes, then stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and 1 c <b>Water</b>. Cover 
    and simmer until potatoes are nearly done, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cauliflower</b>, <b>Eggplant</b>, <b>Green Chilis</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b> (and a little water if it's too dry). Simmer, stirring a 
    couple of times, for about 8 minutes until cauliflower is just crisp 
    tender.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid if needed and taste for <b>Salt</b>. Stir in <b>Fish</b> 
    and simmer covered just long enough for it to be hot (or just long 
    enough to be cooked through if you didn't fry it).</li>
  <li>Garnish with chopped <b>Cilantro</b> amd serve with plenty of 
    steamed Basmati rice. Reheating may degrade texture a little, but the 
    flavor will be even better.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Medium potatoes like White Rose work 
  well here. Avoid Yukon Gold type as they turn to mush if cooked a 
  little long.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Use goose egg size Indian eggplants if you 
  can (but not white ones - they have tough skins). Otherwise any long 
  narrow variety. In either case, split in half and then into pieces 
  about 1 inch long, skin on. If all you have is big purple globes, 
  peel with a vegetable peeler and cube about 1 inch on a side.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Reshampatti is good here, or Korean if 
  you don't have that. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis, Green:</h3> &nbsp; Two Serrano split from under the 
  cap to the tip add just enough hotness to be noticed. Feel free to use 
  more if you like, less, or even none. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Technically this should be Mustard Oil, which 
  needs to be brought up to the smoke point for a second, then cooled 
  a bit before proceeding. This removes the pungency. Pure Olive Oil 
  (not Virgin) works fine too, but don't take that up to smoking. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard 
  Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Indian recipes of this sort very often have 
  you dust the fish and sometimes the potatoes lightly with a little 
  salt and turmeric, then fry them separately until light golden. This 
  step provides a unique flavor but also adds complexity. It can be 
  skipped without ruining the dish, but the flavor will be noticeably 
  less complex.</li>
