A curry with only modest chili heat, but intensely flavored with spices - 
not a dish for wimps. The recipe is a bit of a project, but the 
entire prep section (except 5 minutes for cutting the fish) can be done 
a day ahead.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inch on a side by whatever 
    thickness your fish is.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> as described in <a href="imf_fishtamar2.html#02"><b>
    Note-2</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Separately dry pan roast all <b>Spicing items</b>. <b>Cumin</b> and 
    <b>Coriander</b> should be aromatic but darkened just a shade. The 
    remaining items should be roasted a medium blonde. Grind them to 
    to powder, or as fine as you can get them.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    cut slices into narrow threads, and chop them fine. Mix and pound to 
    paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Curry Leaves</b>, <b>Mustard Seeds</b> and <b>Nigella</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan (3 qt), heat <b>Oil</b> 
    over moderate flame and fry <b>Tempering mix</b> until Mustard seeds 
    are popping well.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Onions</b> and <b>Turmeric</b>. Fry stirring over 
    declining heat until Onions are a medium blonde, taking care the 
    fond adhering to the pan doesn't get too dark.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring until well distributed, 
    about one minute.</li> 
  <li>Stir in ground <b>Spicing mix</b> and <b>Chili Powder</b> until 
    well mixed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Add 
    <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring now and 
    then for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check consistency. Add boiling water if needed (the onions and 
    roasted spices will thicken it greatly).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b>, bring back to a simmer and continue to simmer 
    covered for another 4 to 8 minutes, depending on your fish.</li>
  <li>Check for <b>Salt</b>, then gently stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and take off 
    the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (it's closer to the 
    rice used in southern India than Basmati is). This recipe reheats 
    very well if the right fish is used.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly Philippine 
  markets. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for block form 
  "the size of a golf ball" (1-7/8 ounces) soaked in 3/4 cup hot water 
  and strained. If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, use 7 Tablespoons 
  and add enough water to make 3/4 cup. If you don't have tamarind use 4 t 
  lemon juice - not the same, but it's something. For details and exact 
  method see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chironji:</h3> &nbsp; [Charoli] This ingredient is much used in 
  Andhra, but very difficult to find in North America. I use split raw 
  cashews as a substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cw_chiroz.html"><b>Charoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Poppy Seeds:</b> &nbsp; In India, white poppy seeds are used. 
  They are a bit milder than the blue. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/rn_poppyz.html"><b>Poppy Seed</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "1/4 dry 
  desiccated coconut", which would be about 1-1/2 ounces. We substitute 
  dried grated coconut (insweetened) which is much easier to deal with.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in Indian 
  markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much use. If 
  you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is no 
  acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Authenticity suggests Reshampatti chili 
  powder which is fairly hot. The given measure produces a dish of very 
  moderate heat (by Southern California standards). If you want less hot, 
  use Kashmir or Korean powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
