A very fine tasting curry. Using cream marks this as a recipe for the 
well-to-do, as dairy products are costly in India. The nut paste acts 
as a thickener, common practice before cheap starches became available.

  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into convenient pieces.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Pound them to paste in a mortar. Mix <b>All Marinade 
    items</b>, then stir in <b>Fish</b> until well coated. Marinade for at 
    least 1/2 hour, turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Lightly dry roast the <b>CASHEWS</b> and/or <b>ALMONDS</b> until 
    golden (in spots). Cool thoroughly and pound to a paste in a mortar 
    along with <b>Coconut</b> and <b>Chili Powder</b> (or use a mini-prep

  <li>Chop <b>GARLIC</b> fine.</li>

  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain the <b>Fish</b> well and dab with paper towels.</li>
  <li>In a kadhai or well seasoned iron skillet heat sufficient <b>Oil</b> 
    for frying (see <a href="imf_fishtomato1.html#04">Note-4</a>). Fry <b>Fish</b> until 
    lightly browned on both sides . Drain well and set aside.</li> 
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> 
    and fry stirring until light golden. Stir in Tomatoes and fry 
    stirring over moderate heat until almost all moisture is gone and 
    oil starts to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Nut Paste</b> and fry stirring for 3 minutes. Stir 
    in <b>Garam Masala</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Fish</b> and <b>Cream</b>. 
    Adjust liquid as needed (I usually make it a bit more liquid than 
    shown in the photo for serving with rice) and Simmer about 5 minutes, 
    turning gently once or twice.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are possibilities. All these fish 
  often appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; Kashmir is good if you want the sauce 
  mild, Reshampatti if you want it a little sharper (I use Reshampatti). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders 
  &amp; Flake</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cashews / Almonds:</h3> &nbsp; One or the other can be used if you 
  don't have both, but they should be raw, not roasted.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Frying Fish:</h3> &nbsp; This step is included for many Indian 
  fish curries. It does makes the recipe more difficult and messy, but 
  it also changes the flavor and texture significantly. Deep frying in 
  a kadhai (India wok) as it would be done in India is easiest, but not 
  so suited to our kitchens. Frying in 1/8 inch of oil in a well 
  seasoned iron skillet will work for fish that holds together well. 
  I've found a light dusting of rice flour or potato starch after 
  draining and drying the fish is a great help for frying in shallow 
  oil. The fish holds together better and browns nicely. The starch 
  does thicken the curry some, so it needs more liquid and there will 
  be more sauce, but I don't see that as a problem.</li>
