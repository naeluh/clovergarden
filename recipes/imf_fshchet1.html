  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long by 
    whatever thickness your fillets are.</li>
  <li>If not using concentrate, prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> as described in 
    <a href="imf_fshchet1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> and <b>Coriander</b> in your spice grinder. Mix 
    all <b>Spicing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fairly fine. Quarter <b>GARLIC</b> lengthwise. Slice 
    <b>GINGER</b> thin crosswise, cut slices into threads and chop threads.
    Cut <b>GREEN CHILI</b> in half lengthwise. Mix all <b>Aromatics Items</b>
    </li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium. Measure is after chopping, lightly packed.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan (3 qt), heat <b>Oil</b> 
    over moderate flame and fry <b>Tempering mix</b> until <b>Urad</b> 
    is lightly colored (about 30 seconds).</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Aromatics mix</b> and fry stirring until Onions 
    are just translucent.</li> 
  <li>Stir in ground <b>Spicing mix</b> until well mixed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind</b>, <b>Tomato Sauce</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring 
    to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring now and then for about 15 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Check consistency. Add boiling water if needed - the onions and 
    roasted spices will have thickened it.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b>, bring back to a simmer and continue to simmer 
    covered for another 4 to 8 minutes, depending on your fish.</li>
  <li>Check for <b>Salt</b>, then gently stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and take 
    off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (it's closer to the 
    rice used in southern India than Basmati is). This recipe reheats 
    very well if the right fish is used, in fact, the pattern recipe 
    suggests giving it a rest and reheating it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American or Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). The photo example is with Tilapia, my standard for 
  testing recipes. It is more tender than some, so treat it gently. For 
  stronger tasting fish, Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All 
  these fish often appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Indian green chilis are only erratically 
  available, even here in Los Angeles, so our fall-back hot green chili 
  is the Serrano. The pattern recipe calls for "two green chilis cut in 
  half", but serranos are larger and hotter than Indian green chilis, so 
  we call for only one.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you control the hotness of 
  the dish. I use Indian Khandella or Reshampatti, which are quite hot. 
  This is perfect for me, and probably similar to how it would be in 
  Chettinad, but use your own best judgement. Many people will like it 
  made with a milder chili powder (but don't wimp out). For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in Indian 
  markets, at least here in California. Commercially dried ones aren't of 
  much use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there 
  is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Black Gram] &nbsp; This tiny white dal is 
  available in most Indian markets. If you don't have it, omitting it will 
  not make a big difference in the recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern recipe allows 
  2 cups of pur&eacute;ed Tomatoes, but strongly favors tomato sauce, as 
  do I. A very simple sauce is in order. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, 
  but other simple sauces will also work, even Goya Spanish Style, if you 
  aren't still boycotting them for enthusiastically endorsing Trump on 
  TV. If you use pur&eacute;ed Tomatoes, you will probably want to cut back 
  a bit on the added water.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is very low in Tamarind, getting 
  its sourness from tomatoes, so some from a jar of concentrate should be 
  fine. Otherwise, make it from about 1 Tablespoon of block form soaked in 
  warm water. If you don't have tamarind use 1 t lemon juice - not the same, 
  but it's something. For details and exact method see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Chettinad</h3> &nbsp; Though not right on the coast, Chettinad was 
  home to very wealthy bankers and international traders, especially in the 
  spice trade. The district, a bit south of central Tamal Nadu, is famous 
  for the fabulous mansions scattered about the region, mansions that could 
  easily pass as palaces. It's also famous for its refined, but somewhat 
  spicy, cuisine.</li>
