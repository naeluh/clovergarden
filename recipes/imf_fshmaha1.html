A flavorful curry made with many variations. I composed this recipe 
from 5 recipes, selecting for authenticity, but avoiding Maharastrian 
specialties not available in North America - see notes.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. My 
  favorites are Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack, but Cobia, 
  Cod, and Emperor are also fine. Also Catfish, American and Vietnamese 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). My standard for testing recipes is Tilapia, an 
  "all purpose" fish, but treat it gently. For stronger tasting fish, 
  Indian Mackerel or other Mackerel are good. All these fish often 
  appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly 
  Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Block Tamarind has the best flavor, but 
  Concentrate can be used (just 2 T Concentrate). Chop Block medium and 
  soak 30 minutes in Hot Water. Force through a strainer and discard 
  solids (be sure to scrape paste from outside bottom of strainer). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This curry should have 
  a noticeable chili bite. I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  are fairly hot, but in this quantity the curry isn't particularly hot. 
  A good alternative would be a green Serrano, chopped fine. Use your 
  own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Every English language recipe I've found 
  for this fish curry calls for Garam Masala. I suspect Goda Masala 
  (Sweet Masala) is more "authentic" as it is unique to Maharashtra. 
  Problem: it requires some hard to get ingredients, most importantly 
  a dried Lichen (Dagad Phool). The masala isn't a major factor in this 
  recipe, so unless you intend to do a lot of Maharastrian recipes I'd 
  just go with Garam Masala. For an example, see our recipe for 
  <a href="iys_masalgmk1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Kashmir</b></a>. 
  Meanwhile, since I have Dagad Phool and other hard to get items, I'll 
  be posting a pretty authentic Goda Masala recipe, eventually.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Many Indian recipes do 
  not use Coconut Milk. They scrape (grate) about 3/4 cup of fresh 
  coconut. This is mixed with the Spice mix items and ground to a masala 
  paste in a "mixi" (mixer grinder). This would make a thicker curry, but 
  the onions already make it plenty thick. The mixi is the "must have" 
  appliance in Indian homes that have electricity. It's similar to a 
  blender, but has multiple jars and blades for different tasks. A 
  powerful blender might work, but getting mine out and onto the counter 
  is a federal case. "Scraping" coconut without an Indian coconut scraper 
  is also a hassle, so I'm sticking with the minority and using a top 
  quality Thai coconut milk (Aroy-D).</li>
