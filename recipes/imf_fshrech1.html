<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Select fish durable with wet cooking. The pattern 
  recipe called for Shark or Catfish, and those are traditional, but Shark 
  should be avoided due to over-fishing. Others that would work well are 
  Golden Pompano, Japanese Amberjack, Cobia, Cod, or Vietnamese Catfish 
  (Swai, Basa, Tra). I had no Catfish, so the photo example is with Tilapia, 
  my standard for testing recipes. It needs to be treated a little more 
  gently than the others mentioned, but works. All these fish (except shark) 
  often appear in Asian markets here in Los Angeles, particularly Philippine 
  markets. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The preferred oil for this dish is Coconut Oil, but 
  Pure Olive (not virgin) will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Recheio Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This delicious masala is not too chili hot, 
  despite the reputation for Goa cuisine. It is a very important masala, 
  most often use with fish and shellfish, but also with meats and some 
  vegetables. You can make it by our recipe <a href="ijv_recheo1.html">
  <b>Recheio Masala</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The best vinegar for this dish is Coconut Vinegar, 
  available in markets serving a Philippine community. Other of the fine 
  Philippine vinegars would work well too, or a good Malt Vinegar. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Vinegars &amp; 
  Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Goa Red Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a parboiled light colored rice. It's 
  not much available in North America, so some say to use Basmati Sela, 
  (not regular Basmati), which may be your only option. The most reliable 
  photos I've seen show a par boiled medium grain rice, smaller than 
  California rice and with a scattering of red streaks. While 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html#goa"><b>Goa Red Rice</b></a> is very hard 
  to find, <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html#rmatt"><b>Kerala Rose Matta</b></a> 
  can be had on-line. It looks and is described very much the same, but is 
  grown a ways farther south. <u>Note</u>: a cup of this 
  rice takes 4 cups of water and 1-1/4 hours steaming to cook.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The colony of Goa was where Portuguese sailors 
  introduced hot chilis, vinegar, and pickled pork to India. Chilis spread 
  like wildfire, transforming Indian cuisines throughout the continent, but 
  vinegar didn't go far from Goa, and pickled pork definitely didn't. The 
  Recheio Masala is related to Portuguese cuisine by name. In Portugal, 
  Recheio is a name for stuffings.</li>
