An excellent moderately sour fish curry, and not as chili hot as Goa's 
reputation suggests. See also <a href="imf_fshsour1.html#07"><b>Comments</b></a>, and

  <ol>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b> and cut into thirds, dumping out as many seeds as

    for at least an hour.</li>
  <li>Grind together <b>* Items</b> in your Spice Grinder</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin

  <li>Mix <b>All Items</b> and run to a slightly coarse paste, preferably 
    in an Indian <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, but it 
    can also be done in a processor or blender. Add a little <b>Water</b> 
    if necessary for grinding.</li>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Chop up <b>TAMARIND</b> and start soaking in hot water (if using block 
    form (best)). Soak at least 1/2 hour, then press through a strainer and 
    discard solids.</li> 
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> as needed. For this soup it is usually in rather large 
    chunks. (see <a href="imf_fshsour1.html#01"><b>Fish</b></a> for details).</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold

  <li>Stir <b>Masala Paste</b> and fry stirring about 2 minutes. Add a touch

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cleaned and with head and tail removed. 
  The traditional fish for this dish is Shark, but Catfish has also been 
  popular. Fisheries experts urge you to use Catfish because Sharks are 
  badly over-fished. Shark would be boneless and cut into large chunks for 
  this dish, but Catfish is usually just cut crosswise and 
  goes into soups with skin and bones (1-1/4 inch thick is good). This is 
  a  worldwide practice. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes use 
  <a href="../ingred/cl_kokumz.html"><b>Kokum</b></a> as their souring 
  agent (about 8 pieces for this size recipe). It needs to be removed at 
  serving time. Some use some Tamarind and less Kokum. I use all Tamarind 
  because it is highly available in North America and Kokum is not. Block 
  form Tamarind gives the best flavor. If your Tamarind is concentrate in 
  a jar, use about 3 Tablespoons or to taste. If you don't have Tamarind, 
  use Lemon Juice to taste - not the same, but it's something. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Byadagi Chili</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipes all called for "Kashmir 
  Chilis" (Kashmiri Mirch), but real Kashmir Chilis are in critically short 
  supply in India, never mind here. I see from photos what is actually being 
  used is Byadagis, often labeled "Kashmiri", which are very wrinkled while 
  real Kshamiris are larger and smooth. Byadagis are grown in Karnataka, 
  which almost surrounds Goa. If you can't get Byadagis, you can use 
  Guajillos and add some bright red Paprika for color. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The best vinegar for this dis is Coconut Vinegar, 
  available in markets serving a Philippine community. Other of the fine 
  Philippine vinegars would work well too, or a good Malt Vinegar. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Vinegars &amp; 
  Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The preferred oil for this dish is Coconut Oil, but 
  Pure Olive (not virgin) will work.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Goa Red Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a parboiled light colored rice. It's 
  not much available in North America, so some say to use Basmati Sela, 
  (not regular Basmati), which may be your only option. The most reliable 
  photos I've seen show a par boiled medium grain rice, smaller than 
  California rice and with a scattering of red streaks. While 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html#goa"><b>Goa Red Rice</b></a> is very hard 
  to find, <a href="../ingred/gr_rice.html#rmatt"><b>Kerala Rose Matta</b></a> 
  can be had on-line. It looks and is described very much the same, but is 
  grown a ways farther south. <u>Note</u>: a cup of this 
  rice takes 4 cups of water and 1-1/4 hours steaming to cook.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The colony of Goa was where Portuguese sailors 
  introduced hot chilis, vinegar, and pickled pork to India. Chilis spread 
  like wildfire, transforming Indian cuisines throughout the continent, but 
  vinegar didn't go far from Goa, and pickled pork definitely didn't. The 
  Recheio Masala is related to Portuguese cuisine by name. In Portugal, 
  Recheio is a name for stuffings.</li>
