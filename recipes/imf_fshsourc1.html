Famous and delicious! Delicious! From the list you can see this is not a 
dish for wimps, but in Sri Lanka, even the women love this dish - so man 
up, or slink out.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare your <b>FISH</b> (scale, clean, fillet or whatever you need 
    to do)</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>GORAKA</b> in 1/2 cup hot water until soft. Chop it fine, 
     then pound to a paste in a mortar. Add just enough water to make 
     a thin paste (the soaking water is fine).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Slice 
    <b>GINGER</b> thin and chop small. Mix all with Goraka.</li>
  <li> Grind <b>Peppercorns</b> and <b>Cardamom</b> in your spice 
    grinder.and mix with Goraka.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Paste items</b> and run as smooth as you can get it 
    in a blender or mini-prep processor.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt), line with <b>Banana 
    Leaf</b> (if using). Place <b>Pandan Leaf</b> in the pan (if using).
    </li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, mix <b>Fish</b> with <b>Paste</b> and 1/2 cup 
    <b>Water</b>. Massage it all together until evenly distributed 
    (taking care not to break up the fish). Let it sit aside for 20 
    minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Mix 1 cup <b>Water</b> into the <b>Fish</b>, then place pieces 
    in the saut&eacute; pan, in a single layer if possible. Scatter 
    <b>Curry Leaves</b> over the Fish, then pour all the Sauce remaining 
    in the bowl over the Fish.</li> 
  <li>Cook uncovered over medium heat until the liquid is of sauce 
    consistency. Do not stir or the fish may break up, just shake the pan 
    now and then.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for Fillets, skin on 
  or skin off as appropriate. The <u>official</u> fish is Tuna, some 
  prefer Bonito as the best Tuna for the dish. Mackerel is also used, 
  and other fish that cook firm can be used. The photo is of my test 
  run, and my test runs are always with Tilapia, and it worked fine, 
  but mackerel would be my choice (Tuna is in the Mackerel family).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Goraka:</h3> &nbsp; [Gambooge, Gummi-Gutta] &nbsp; Most recipes 
  call for 5 pieces (0.75 ounce, 21 grams) but I use a bit more 
  (1 oz = 28 grams = 6 pieces). Goraka may be difficult to find, but 
  it is available on-line. If you can't get it, use Black Kokum (more 
  plum-like and less citrusy). If you can't get that either use Tamarind 
  Paste - different, considered too sour for fish, but in the ball park 
  (Goraka is often called "fish tamarind"). Cut a 2 ounce piece from the 
  block, or 3 Tablespoons from a jar. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cl_kokumz.html"><b>Kokum / Gambooge</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I don't know what chili powder they use 
  in Sri Lanka, but I use Indian Reshampatti or Khandela, which are 
  medium hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Banana Leaf</h3> &nbsp; This is particularly needed for the 
  traditional Sri Lankan method. A clay pot is lined with Banana Leaf 
  to prevent sticking, and in the traditional method, the curry is 
  simmered down until very dry. Banana Leaf is less needed if you keep 
  your curry somewhat liquid, as many do today.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use (unless you force dried them yourself within a couple weeks). If 
  you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is no 
  acceptable substitute. My curry leaf trees bear leaves much smaller 
  than commercial curry leaves, so I double the quantity. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Pandan Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; Some toss in some Pandanus leaf. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/pd_pandan.html"><b>Pandanus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Originating with the Sinhala people of Sri 
  Lanka, this was also a method for preserving fish. Simmered down quite 
  dry, this dish can sit at room temperature for several days without 
  spoiling. Today, with refrigeration available, many people, including 
  myself, like a bit of sauce with it, and don't boil it down completely 
  dry. The Paste varies somewhat from recipe to recipe, in complexity 
  and ingredients. As given here it is quite typical. As for the name, 
  <i>Maalu</i> means Fish, <i>Ambul</i> means Sour. I find no 
  translation for <i>Thiyal</i> so I presume it is a Sinhala name for 
  a particular type of dry curry.</li>
