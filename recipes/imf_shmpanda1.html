Wow! this is really good! A simple but wonderfully tasty shrimp dish in the style of the Andaman 
Islands off the coast of Tamil Nadu in southeast India. With coconut, 
onions and tamarind.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>TAMARIND</b> in hot water to cover, 20 minutes or more. 
    For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
    <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and de-vein if needed, and save the shells for 
    broth. For details see our <a href="../ingred/seashrimpw.html">
    <b>Working with Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine and mix with <b>PEPPERCORNS</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Press <b>Tamarind</b> through a strainer, discarding solids. 
    Mix paste (make sure you scraped all from the outside of the 
    strainer) together with all <b>Seasonings items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b>, stir in <b>Tempering</b> (careful, the Curry 
    leaves will snap and spit for a moment) and fry until Mustard 
    seeds are popping well.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion Mix</b> and fry stirring until Onions show a 
    touch of color, then stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b> and continue frying 
    until Garlic is light golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk Mix</b>, and 1/2 cup <b>Broth</b>, cover and 
    simmer 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Shrimp</b>, check <b>Salt</b> and liquid. Bring to a 
    boil, and simmer until shrimp are cooked, perhaps a minute more.

  <li>Serve with steamed Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is not appropriate 
    this far south.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Do not</u> buy pre-cooked shrimp for this 
  recipe (or any other recipe), they are pretty much devoid of shrimp 
  flavor. The Shrimp used for the example photo were 31-40, a good medium 
  size, purchased headless in the shell. Size you use is up to you.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chile Serrano</h3> &nbsp; One Serrano and the given amount of 
  Reshampatti Chile Powder is the perfect hotness for me. If you have 
  yet to make your sacrifices to the Chili Gods, you may want to cut both 
  in half. If you go for less than that, you fall into the category we 
  initiates call "Wimps".</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut Milk</h3> &nbsp; Must be unsweetened. Brands from Thailand 
  are best, my favorite being Aroy-D.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; A good choice for this region is 
  Reshampatti, but others are fine too. Again, use your own best 
  judgement. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use (unless you force dried them yourself within a couple weeks). If 
  you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is no 
  acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seeds are always 
  used, but yellow will work if you don't have black.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Best to make this broth by simmering the shells 
  from the shrimp for about 15 minutes. If you don't have the shells, 
  use some other broth, or plain water if necessary.</li>
