  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and de-vein if needed. You can leave the 
    tails on if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice about 1/4 inch wide 
      crosswise.</li>
    <li>Opt: &nbsp;  Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
      off the skins under running water.  (see <a href="imf_shmpdev1.html#04">
      <b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
    <li>Cut <b>Bell Peppers</b> into strips about 3/8 inch wide and 1-1/2
      inches long.</li>
    <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>. If serving as a main dish with rice, 
      add a couple tablespoons of Water.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or skillet, heat <b>OIL</b> over highest flame, but not 
    quite to smoking.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring for 30 seconds. Stir in 
    <b>Bell Peppers</b> and fry stirring for 1 minute. Stir in 
    <b>Shrimp</b> and fry stirring 1-1/4 minutes, then stir in 
    <b>Sauce</b> and fry stirring 1 minute more. Note: stirring in time 
    doesn't count, time is for after stirring in - but stir in as quickly 
    as possible.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; [Prawns] &nbsp; Weight is raw, headless, 
  shelled and de-veined.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, 
  which comes in small 8 ounce cans, but other simple sauces will also 
  work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you control the Devil. 
  I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which makes this recipe fairly 
  hot, and to my liking. Use your own best judgement on what powder 
  and how much. Just keep in mind it's Sri Lankan, so should not be mild. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe doesn't blast the 
  Bell Peppers, but cuts them into smaller 1/2 inch squares. The cooking 
  time is so short this works well enough, but I still prefer the mouth 
  feel with the skins off - particularly important if any part will be 
  reheated. With the torch, it only takes a few minutes.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is from a cookbook by a 
  married couple of Sri Lankans, he a Tamil, she Sinhalese - but it was 
  published in England, so typically, the photo does not at all represent 
  the recipe. It shows a small dish with several sauced shrimp and a 
  folded dosa - no vegetables at all. For most English cookbooks the 
  publisher holds the copyright, so authors have limited control. I 
  have modifying handling the onion. The pattern recipe quarterd it 
  lingthwise, then spread out the layers of the quarters.</li>
