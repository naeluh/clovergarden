This is a very flavorful, moderately spicy curry from India that should 
be enjoyable to anyone not allergic to shrimp. See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min - exclusive of shelling Shrimp)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> if using block form. Chop course and soak in 
      2/3 cup hot water for at least 1/2 hour. Strain out and discard 
      the solids.</li>
  <li>Shell and de-vein <b>SHRIMP</b>.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Make curry paste. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice 
     <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine. 
     Grind <b>Coriander</b>, <b>Mustard</b> and <b>Cumin</b>. Mix all 
     with <b>Garam Masala</b>. Pound it all to a paste in a big mortar 
     - or run in a mini-prep food processor with 1 T water.</li>
     </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Curry Leaves</b> 
      for a few seconds until they stop snapping, then stir in 
      <b>Onion</b>. Fry stirring until onion is translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> and fry gently, stirring until it 
      starts to dry out and onion threatens to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add 
      water if needed to achieve your desired consistency (should be 
      pretty thin for serving with rice).</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Shrimp</b>, bring back to a simmer and simmer 
      gently for 5 minutes or until shrimp are pink and opaque. Check 
      liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind</b> and <b>Salt</b> to taste.
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice (see 
    <a href="imf_shrimpmasala1.html#06">Note-6</a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for raw headless shrimp, shell on.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is 
  concentrate in a jar, use 3 T. If it's block form use about 3 T, 
  soak 1/2 hour in 3/4 cup warm water and press through a strainer 
  (use all the liquid). If you don't have tamarind use 3 t lemon 
  juice - not the same, but it's something. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; Since this is from the southern parts of 
  India, a southern GM is appropriate, similar to our 
  <a href="iys_masaltn1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Tamil Nadu</b></a> 
  version, but in a pinch a northern GM will do (not as sharp).</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In southern India the predominant 
  cooking oil is Coconut Oil. It's not nearly as bad as the AHA has told 
  you, in fact, it may be the most healthy cooking oil available. A 
  suitable substitute is Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). For details see 
  out <a href="../ingred/oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; A popular rice in the south is Sona Masoori, but 
  Thai Jasmine will work fine, and Basmati is always an option.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is adapted from an older Indian 
  cookbook (1976), referring it only to South India. It is one of the 
  earliest recipes on this site, so I reviewed it for validity in 2014. 
  I found a recipe very close to this one attributed to Goa, and decided 
  to let this older recipe stand as written in 2004, with revised notes 
  and new photo.</li>
