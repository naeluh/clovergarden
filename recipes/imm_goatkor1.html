This dish is in the style of Hyderabad, so it is more closely related 
to the softly spiced Mughlai cuisines of northwest India than to those 
of the rest of southern India.

In India the word "mutton" commonly refers to goat, not to mature sheep. 
Goat is the main meat of India, but during the Raj, the British called 
it "mutton" to make it taste more British, and the name stuck. This has 
caused a lot of confusion in recipes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr exclusive of de-fat &amp; de-bone Goat)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim away excess fat and remove bones from <b>MUTTON</b>. Cut into 
    pieces about 1-1/2 inches on a side or however it works out.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Mix and pound to paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Garlic mix</b> into <b>Mutton</b> and set aside until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into pieces about 1 inch on a side. 
    </li>
  <li>Deep fry <b>Potatoes</b> until a light blonde, or pan fry (see 
    <a href="imm_goatkor1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>). Do this while doing other prep 
    work. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>"PUMPKIN"</b> and cut into cubes about 1 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Separately dry pan roast <b>Caraway</b> and <b>Coriander</b> until 
    aromatic but darkened just a shade. Roast <b>Chironji</b> until 
    light golden. Cool them well. Grind all <b>Spicing items</b> as fine 
    as you can get them. Mix all.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Massage <b>Spicings mix</b> into the <b>Mutton</b>, then stir in 
    yogurt.</li>
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan (3 qt), heat <b>Ghee</b> 
    over moderate flame and fry <b>Onions</b> stirring over declining 
    heat until light blonde, taking care they don't stick to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Mutton mix</b> into the pan with the Onions. Fry stirring 
    until all liquid has evaporated and the oils starts to separate. 
    Scrape the fond off the bottom as you go. If it won't scrape any 
    more - then watch it. It should remain reddish. If it starts 
    to trend towards chocolate go on to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in 4 cups <b>Water</b>. Scrape up the fond and bring to a 
    boil, cover tightly and simmer, stirring now and then, until goat is 
    2/3 done, about 1-1/3 hours.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>"Pumpkin"</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Cover 
    and simmer, stirring now and then, until goat is tender, about 
    30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check consistency. Add boiling water if needed (the onions and 
    roasted spices will thicken it greatly).</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (it's closer to the 
    rice used in southern India than Basmati is). You could also serve 
    with hot Roti (flat breads).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mutton:</h3> &nbsp; This can be Goat, Sheep, or even Lamb. I 
  prefer Goat, and can get it cheaper than Mutton or Lamb. This is 
  important, because all these are 1/3 bone, 1/3 fat and 1/3 meat, 
  so your cost for meat will be three times the already high price 
  marked.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well for recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes as they disintegrate 
  into mush if cooked a little longer than the minimum. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "pumpkin, ash 
  gourd or squash". "Pumpkin" doesn't mean our Halloween type, but a 
  cooking type winter squash like Kabocha or Acorn Squash. Gourds are 
  less sweet, but hold their shape well in cooking. Ash Gourd 
  (Winter Melon) is good, but the photo example was made with easily 
  available Opo Squash (Bottle Gourd). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gourds.html"><b>Gourds</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/squash.html"><b>Squash</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chironji:</h3> &nbsp; [Charoli] This ingredient is much used in 
  Telangana, but very difficult to find in North America. I use split 
  raw cashews as a substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cw_chiroz.html"><b>Charoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "a 2 inch piece 
  of dry coconut". I have estimated the intended weight and replaced it 
  with dried grated coconut which is more available and much easier to 
  deal with.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cinnamon:</h3> &nbsp; In India real Cinnamon is  used rather than 
  the Cassia Bark common in North America. Real cinnamon is a lot easier 
  to grind, and can be found in the spice section of almost any market 
  serving a Mexican community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Ghee</h3> &nbsp; This is thoroughly clarified butter, available 
  in jars in most markets serving Indian communities. Use only "butter 
  ghee", the vegetable stuff often contains lots of deadly trans fats. 
  Other choice would be Avocado Oil (buttery), Coconut Oil (used in the 
  region) or Pure Olive Oil (not virgin).</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is oil for deep frying the potatoes. If you 
  don't have it handy you can fry the Potatoes in the oil that will be 
  used to fry the Onions, more attention needed, but workable. Add a 
  little more oil as needed.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Changes:</h3> &nbsp; I have re-sequenced this recipe and changed 
  some quantities, because I didn't like it made as in the pattern 
  recipe (way too much sauce, not enough goat, and potatoes dissolved 
  to mush). I also added a little Chili Powder to brighten it up (I 
  live in Southern California where a stew without at least some chili 
  is unthinkable). The amount I used is barely detectable. Easily 
  available Reshampatti powder is appropriate for the region. The 
  pattern recipe also included 1/4 t Saffron, but in a recipe with 
  so much spicing I don't think the expensive Saffron contributes 
  much, it's just traditional in the (formerly) Muslim Hyderabad 
  cuisine.</li>
