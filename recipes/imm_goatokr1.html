Goat is the main meat of India, but during the Raj, the British called it 
"mutton" to make it taste more British, and the name stuck.  This curry 
is lighter and brighter than the Mughlai style mutton curry of Hyderabad.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (variable, depending on cut)
  <ol>
  <li>De-bone and de-fat your <b>Goat</b>, <b>Mutton</b>, or 
    <b>Lamb</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Trim away excess fat and remove bones from <b>MUTTON</b>. Cut into 
    pieces about 1-1/2 inches on a side or however it works out.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Mix and pound to paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Garlic mix</b> and <b>Oil</b> into <b>Mutton</b> and 
    set aside for at least an hour.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into pieces about 1 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Deep fry <b>Potatoes</b> until a light blonde, or pan fry (see 
    <a href="imm_goatokr1.html#08">Note-8</a>). Do this while doing other prep work. 
    Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Shave the hard cap from the <b>OKRAS</b>. Use a very sharp knife 
    and cut in the form of a cone, making sure you do not cut into the 
    hollow part.</li>
  <li>In a non-reactive bowl, tumble <b>Okras</b> with <b>Vinegar</b>. 
    Let them soak for 30 minutes, tumbling occasionally to make sure 
    they stay coated - this treatment prevents them from splitting open 
    during cooking.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>Tomatoes</b> in boiling water 1 minute, quench in cold 
    water, peel and dice about 3/8 inch.</li> 
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>Coriander</b> until aromatic but darkened just 
    a shade. Grind to powder and mix with <b>Chili Powder</b> and 
    <b>Turmeric</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> and <b>Mint</b> small. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="13">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan (3 qt), heat <b>Oil</b> 
    over moderate flame and fry <b>Onions</b> stirring over declining 
    heat until light blonde, taking care they don't stick to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coriander mix</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Optional Spices</b> if used.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Mutton mix</b> into the pan. Fry stirring until all 
    liquid has evaporated and oil begins to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in 3 cups <b>Water</b>. Scrape up the fond and bring to a 
    boil. Cover tightly and simmer, stirring now and then, until goat is 
    2/3 done, about 1-1/3 hours.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Okra</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b> Cover and simmer, stirring now and then, until goat is 
    tender, about 30 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Check consistency. Add boiling water if needed - the sauce should 
    be fairly liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Herb mix</b> until well distributed. Take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (it's closer to the 
    rice used in southern India than Basmati is). You could also serve 
    with hot Roti (flat breads).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mutton:</h3> &nbsp; This can be Goat, Sheep, or even Lamb. I 
  prefer Goat, and I can often get it cheaper than Mutton or Lamb 
  (here, all come from New Zealand). Price is important, because all 
  these are 1/3 bone, 1/3 fat and 1/3 meat, so your cost for actual 
  meat will be three times the price marked.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe allows oil or ghee (highly 
  clarified butter). Coconut oil would be an appropriate choice for this 
  region, but Avocado Oil or Pure Olive Oil (not virgin) will work fine. 
  In India, expensive ghee is used for fancy occasions, but use only 
  real butter ghee - vegetable ghees may be loaded with trans fats. 
  For details see our <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well for recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes as they disintegrate 
  into mush if cooked a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select the smallest, youngest tender pods you 
  can find. Older pods can be fibrous. Try for 3 inches or less, but 
  the smallest I could find for the photo example were 4 inches.  For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/mw_okraz.html"><b>Okra</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Easily available Reshampatti powder is 
  appropriate for this region. 2 teaspoons makes a curry that is very 
  moderately hot by Southern California standards - if in doubt, cut it 
  back a bit, but not less than 1 teaspoon. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cinnamon:</h3> &nbsp; In India real Cinnamon is used, which releases 
  flavor faster than the Cassia Bark called "cinnamon" in North America. 
  It can be found in the spice section of almost any market serving a 
  Mexican community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is oil for deep frying the potatoes. If you 
  don't have it handy you can fry the Potatoes in the oil that will be 
  used to fry the Onions, more attention needed, but workable. Add a 
  little more oil as needed.</li>
