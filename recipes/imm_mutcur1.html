This is one of the most popular dishes among those people of Andhra Pradesh 
who are not vegetarian. Gongura is also much used in the vegetarian cuisine 
of the region.

<li>Stir in <b>Goat</b> with marinade, the <b>Spice mix</b>, then 
  <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer until Goat is

<li>Adjust liquid to the amount you desire, by adding water or simmering

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><h3>
  Goat / Mutton:</h3> &nbsp; Goat is the most common meat in India, 
  but the British called it "Mutton" during the Raj, thinking goat below 
  their station. Mutton is a good substitute but neither Goat nor Mutton 
  is common in most of North America. Use Lamb if you can't get either. 
  Weight is for boneless with all excess fat removed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Reshampatti would be an appropriate 
  powder - it's fairly hot, but this dish is supposed to be rather hot - 
  in fact hotter than I have given it here. Use your own best judgement. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Gongura / Kenaf:</h3> &nbsp; This member of the 
  mallow family is now reasonably available in parts of North America 
  where there are Indian or Persian communities. It tastes much like 
  sorrel. Use only grean leaf, not even leaf stems. This is a fiber crop - 
  stems are far too tough to eat. To get 4 ounces (1-3/4 cups tight packed) 
  you will need to start with about a 10 ounce bunch. If you can't get 
  Gongura, try Sorrel (different texture), and lacking that, try Spinach 
  (somewhat different flavor). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mw_kenafz.html"><b>Kenaf - Gongura</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; 2 Serranos will make this dish very moderately 
  hot (or perhaps distressingly hot if you're from the Frozen North). 
  Use your own best judgement. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; A Southern GM would be appropriate here 
  (see our recipe for <a href="iys_masaltn1.html"><b>Garum Masala - 
  Tamil Nadu</b></a> for an example) but a Northern one will do in a 
  pinch. Some recipes omit the Garum Masala.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Most (but not all) Indian recipes for this 
  dish make it in a pressure cooker. These are very popular in India 
  where fuel is scarce and expensive, because cooking time is shorter, 
  but they have long been out of style in North America. Since most 
  households here don't have one, I use a stovetop method.</li>
