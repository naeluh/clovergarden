Very simple and simply delicious. Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland (where 
a similar dish, <i>Thevo Chu</i>, is made) are tribal regions in the 
extreme northeast of India. See also <a href="imm_pigbamb1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (17 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> into pieces about 1/2 inch thick and 1 inch on a 
    side. Cut fat about 1/4 that size.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into strips 
    about 1/2 inch wide by 1 inch long, or however works with the size you 
    have.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in 
    cold water and peel. Chop coarse and mix with Bamboo.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Slit <b>CHILIS</b> open lengthwise. Mix all with Tomatoes 
    along with <b>Salt</b>..</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Water</b> and mix in <b>Pork</b>. 
    Let it cook, stirring now and then, over moderate heat until the water 
    has evaporated and the fat is starting to render. It should not brown.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bamboo mix</b> Cover and simmer slowly, stirring now and 
    then, until pork is tender, about 3/4 hour. Adjust liquid as needed - 
    there should be some, but not a lot.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> and serve hot with <b>Rice</b>. Both long 
    grain <i>indica</i> and medium grain <i>japonica</i> rice are used in 
    Arunachal Pradesh.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Any cut but it should include some 
  fat. In Arunachal Pradesh smoked pork may be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3>  &nbsp; Fresh is best, vacuum packed is second 
  best and canned third. If you use canned refresh them in boiling water 
  for a couple minutes to remove some of the "canned" taste. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html#var"><b>Bamboo</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Thai chilis are fine. Adjust to your 
  tolerance. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments</h3> In this far northeast tribal region, ingredients are 
  similar to those of China. Cooking oil is not used in the region, nor 
  are Indian curry spices, but herbs (most not available in North America) 
  are very popular ingredients. During WW II the Japanese tried to invade 
  this region from Burma, with insufficient men, insufficent equipment, 
  not enough food or medical supplies, and an impossible re-supply 
  situation. The operation was a total disaster.</li>
