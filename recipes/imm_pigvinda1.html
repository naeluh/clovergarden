India learned this dish from 16th century Portuguese sailors in Goa, the 
port through which they introduced hot chilis, vinegar and pickled pig.  
Pickled pig and vinegar didn't go far from Goa - but chilis were soon 
the darling of southern Asia.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9+ hrs - 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into 3/4 inch cubes removing all fat (Indian cooking 
    does not use animal skin or fat).</li>
  <li>Make marinade: Grind all the spices to a powder. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop very fine, mix 
    with Garlic and pound to paste in a mortar. Work everything together 
    into a smooth paste.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Marinade</b> thoroughly into <b>Pork</b> and set aside 
    for at least 4 hours, but 6 to 8 is better. If you just must marinade 
    in the fridge, that'll be 16 hours minimum.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise.
    </li>
  <li>When ready to start cooking, crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Split <b>CHILIS</b> in 
    quarters lengthwise or slice in fairly wide diagonals. Mix all.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain <b>Marinade</b> from <b>Pork</b> - <u>DO NOT discard 
    marinade</u>!</li>
  <li><b>ONLY IF</b> using <b>MUSTARD OIL</b> (<a href="imm_pigvinda1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>), heat in the saut&eacute; pan until the first 
    trace of smoke, then turn off heat and let cool just a little.</li>  
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion</b>, 
    stirring diligently until a uniform light blond color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili Mix</b> and fry stirring vigorously until garlic 
    takes on some color, then stir in the <b>Pork</b> and continue to 
    stir until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Marinade</b> and 1/4 c <b>Water</b>. <b>Salt</b> to 
    taste (don't skimp, you're gonna die anyway), cover and simmer for 
    about 40 minutes or until Pork is reasonably tender, but not falling 
    apart.</li>
  <li><b>Serve</b> with steamed Basmati rice and plenty of <b>Beer</b> 
    or <b>Red Wine</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Dried Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The count of dried 
  chilis is for the common <b>Japones</b>, which are relatively mild. 
  I prefer the much hotter de Arbols or Thai chilis. Apply windage for 
  your chilis and your tolerance. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis Serranos:</h3> &nbsp; The hot green chilis used in India 
  aren't much available in North America, so we use Serranos - a bit 
  thicker walled and different in flavor, but they work fine. The 
  number of chilis given in this recipe results in a <b>shamefully mild 
  vindaloo</b>, so feel free to adjust up to taste (only foks from the 
  Frozen North are allowed to adjust down).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This oil is found in markets that serve 
  an Indian community, it is always labeled "for massage use only" due 
  to lack of FDA certification. While it's necessary for authenticity, 
  if you don't have it use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp;  This dish improves with age. Refrigerated it 
  should be brought to a simmer once a week, if kept at room temperature, 
  every day or two depending on the temperature of the room.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Pig is not widely eaten in India for 
  economic reasons, but the Kodava, inland from Goa, hold pig in high 
  esteem. If burdened by dietary prohibitions you will have to use beef 
  or lamb, but some heretics now use chicken, and some American self 
  styled "chefs" substitute tomatoes for the vinegar. Intolerable! This 
  is a dish for drunken sailors, not polite society.</li>
