<p>This recipe is easy to make - don't let all those notes frighten you, 
they're just stuff you should know before starting.</p>

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>GREEN TOMATOES</b> into pieces less than 1/2 inch on a 
    side.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>TOOR DAL</b> in several changes of water. Put in a sauce 
    pan with 2 cups <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil uncovered (to 
    prevent it from foaming over) and simmer covered until tender and 
    starting to break up (45 minutes or more). See 
    <a href="imp_gntommas1.html#12"><b>Note-12</b></a> on Cooking Toor Dal.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TAMARIND PASTE</b> and soak in 2 cups freshly boiled water 
    for 1/2 hour or more. Strain through a wire strainer, retaining 
    the liquid and forcing the paste through the strainer with a wooden 
    spoon. Discard the fiber. Be sure to scrape the outside of the 
    strainer, as much will be stuck there.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Powders items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> small for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt), coverable wok or kadhai, 
    heat <b>Oil</b> quite hot. Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> and let it 
    sputter for just 20 seconds, then stir in <b>Chili</b>, followed 
    immediately by <b>Tomatoes</b>. Fry until the tomato liquid is at 
    a boil.</li>
  <li>Turn heat to low. Cover tightly and sweat the Tomatoes, stirring 
    now and then, for about 20 minutes. Mash them some every time 
    you stir. I use a wooden pestle.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Powders mix</b> and fry stirring for a couple of 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind liquid</b> and bring to a boil. Cover tightly 
    and simmer over low heat for another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Toor Dal</b> and simmer another 5 minutes. 
    Adjust liquid with boiling water if needed, this dish should be 
    almost soup-like.</li>  
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>. Accompany with Roti 
    or long grain rice (south Indian or Thai Jasmine).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are unripe regular tomatoes, 
  <u>not</u> "Mexican Green Tomatoes" (Tomatillo) which are   not 
  actually tomatoes. The tomatoes should be solid green or with a 
  slight white or pink blush. Riper tomatoes can be used, but must be 
  very hard. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomato.html"><b>Tomatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split Pigeon Peas, also 
  called Tuvar Dal and Red Gram (for the flowers). For a lighter flavor 
  you could use Moong Dal- peeled and split Mung Beans, and some recipes 
  call for half of each. Both these are available at any market serving 
  an Indian community. See <a href="imp_gntommas1.html#12"><b>Note-12</b></a> for cooking 
  details.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This comes in several forms. This 
  recipe uses block paste, but if you wish to use concentrate, use 
  the same amount. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The hot green Jwala chilis used in India 
  are not much available, even here in Los Angeles, so we use Serranos. 
  One, combined with the Chili Powder, will make this dish moderately 
  hot by Southern California standards. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India black mustard seeds are always 
  used, but yellow will work.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This tiny white dal is split and peeled 
  urad beans (black gram). It is easily available in any market serving 
  an Indian community. If you don't have it, leaving it out will not make 
  a lot of difference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic, but 
  is also often combined with onions. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are 
  two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or ground) and the more common 
  "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut with rice flour. The 
  amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much 
  if what you have is the "powder" form. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Dahni chilis would be used, which 
  are essentially the same as our Thai Chilis, but the common Japones 
  could also be used for a little less hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are essential for the true flavors 
  of southern India, and fortunately are becoming more common in Indian 
  markets, at least here in Los Angeles. If you don't have them, leave 
  them out - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Sambar Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important masala in southern 
  India. It can be purchased, but is better made at home. Here is our 
  recipe for <a href="iys_masalsp02.html"><b>Sambar Powder</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; I use Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  makes this dish fairly hot by Southern California standards. If in 
  doubt, use Kashmir powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Cooking Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; Toor Dal must be well washed to keep 
  it from foaming too much, either in several changes of water or by 
  shaking vigorously in a wire strainer under hot running water. Place 
  in a saucepan with plenty of head room and bring to a boil uncovered. 
  I usually use a skimmer to remove the pile of foam that rises. Turn 
  to a very low simmer, cover and simmer for 45 minutes or longer until 
  as tender as you want it. Time depends on the texture you want (I 
  like more texture than they do in India) and on the age of the Toor 
  Dal. If it is old, it will never be tender, no matter how long you 
  simmer it. Unfortunately, you can't tell how old it is until you try 
  cooking it. It should end up with almost no free water, but there 
  should be some - hold uncovered at a high simmer for a while if there 
  is too much. In India, where fuel is always in short supply, this 
  cooking is often done in a much shorter time in a pressure cooker 
  (for three whistles or so), but few homes in North America have a 
  pressure cooker these days.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A Masiyal is very similar to a Sambar, 
  except the vegetables are mashed. Thakkali is Tomato in Tamil, and 
  Kai is "raw", but really means unripe. Recipes of this sort are made 
  with different steps depending on the cook. The biggest difference 
  is that some do the recipe without the Tempering, then fry the 
  Tempering in a teaspoon of oil and stir it into the recipe just 
  before serving.</li>
