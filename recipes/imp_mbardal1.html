  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>MALABAR SPINACH</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Check <b>DAL</b> for foreign objects and rinse.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and chop small. Split <b>CHILI</b> lengthwise into 
    quarters. Do not scrape out the seeds unless you really feel you need 
    to. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Mix all.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (65 minutes)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a roomy saucepan, place <b>Dal</b>, <b>Spinach</b> and <b>Onion mix</b> 
    along  with <b>Turmeric</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 2 cups <b>Water</b>, Bring to a 
    boil uncovered (so it doesn't foam over), then cover and simmer slowly 
    until Dal is just short of done - about 55 minutes.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> with the side of your prep knife. Cap 
    <b>CHILIS</b> and spill out loose seeds. Mix together all 
    <b>Tadka items</b> <u>except</u> Oil and Mustard Seed.</li>
  <li>In an iron skillet, heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Mustard Seeds</b> 
    and fry stirring until they are popping well, then stir in all 
    <b>Tadka items</b>. Fry stirring for about 15 to 30 seconds until the 
    urad and chilis darken a bit, then pour into the finished <b>Dal</b> 
    and give it a stir.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind Paste</b> and 1/2 cup <b>Water</b>. Simmer 
    uncovered for 7 to 10 minutes or until you get the consistency you 
    want. In India it would be cooked to mush, but around here we like 
    a little more texture.</li>
  <li>Check salt and serve with steamed rice (this is southern India so 
    Thai Jasmine rice is good). Some suggest serving a stir fry along 
    with it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Mong Toi, Saan Choy] &nbsp; Weight 
  is for leaves and tender tips after removing large stems, because 
  steminess can vary, but around here it'll be about 14 ounces with 
  stems. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; Also called Tur Dal, Red Gram and various 
  other names - it is one of the most common dals used in India. It is 
  split and peeled pigeon peas.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; Indian chilis are scarce 
  even here in Los Angeles - most Indian groceries stock Serranos. These 
  are hotter than most Indian chilis and around here they've become rather 
  large, so I suggest just one - adjust as you desire. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Red:</h3> &nbsp; Use small dried red chilis according 
  to your best judgement. The common Japones will be fairly  mild, 
  Arabols less so and Thai a bit spicy. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This very white dal is split and peeled 
  black urad beans (gram dal). In India they are used both in bean 
  dishes and a very common ingredient in tadkas, so are easily 
  available in Indian markets. If you don't have them they can be 
  omitted without greatly changing the recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Bean</b></a> page .</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 1 T, or if it's block use about 1 T, soak and strain. If you don't 
  have tamarind use 2 t lemon juice - not the same, but it's something. 
  For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Mntion to your less experienced guests that 
  the curry leaves (if used) are not edible. This dish is also made 
  with Masoor Dal (red lentils).</li>
