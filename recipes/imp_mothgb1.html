A delightful, moderately spiced bean dish, for light main or side. In 
India, the Moth Beans are always sprouted before cooking, but you can 
do the dish with well soaked beans.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 hrs or 30 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>MOTH BEANS</b> and soak in lightly salted water (skip the 
    salt if you will be sprouting them) for about 6 hours, drain.</li>
  <li><u>IF Sprouting</u>: &nbsp; Follow instructions given on our 
    <a href="../ingred/bp_sproutm.html"><b>Sprouting Bean, Peas, &amp; 
    Lentils</b></a> page. Sprout them until they have tails about 3/4 
    inch long. With fresh Moth, this can take as little as 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Tip and Tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> and slice into 1/4 inch lengths. 
    </li>
  <li>Bring a pan of water to a boil, add 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and cook 
    <b>Green Beans</b> until just barely done. Drain and refresh 
    under Cold running water. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Chop all <b>PASTE items</b> small and the Ginger fine. Run in a 
    Mixie, Food Processor, or Blender until reduced to a paste. Add just 
    enough water to get a paste consistency.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan, Heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Mustard Seed</b> and <b>Cumin Seed</b>. When mustard seeds are 
    popping well, stir in <b>Asafoetida</b> and immediately stir in 
    <b>Paste mix</b>. Fry stirring until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Moth Beans</b> and 1/2 c <b>Water</b>. Cover and simmer 
    over low heat until moth is tender (1/2 hr or so for sprouted, 
    probably more for just soaked). Stir occasionally and check water, 
    it should not be dry.</li>  
  <li>Stir in <b>Green Beans</b>, <b>Amchur</b>, and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Bring back to a simmer for a few minutes and adjust liquid as 
    needed.</li>
  <li>In India this would be served with roti or some other bread. I 
    usually make it a little more liquid and serve with rice. A good 
    quality Sella Basmati goes very well with this (Sella means Par 
    Boiled).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Moth Beans</h3> &nbsp; These are very tiny beans available 
  only in markets serving and Indian community. for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_mothz.html"><b>Moth Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili</h3>	&nbsp; In India, this might be a Jawala Chili, 
  quite hot. That type of chili is hard to find in North America, so 
  here we use a Serrano, similarly hot. If you want a little more 
  hot, use a whole one. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seeds are always 
  used (except brown in Bengal), but the yellow ones will work if you 
  don't have black.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Amchur</h3> &nbsp; This is dried powder of Unripe Mango. If you 
  don't have it, substitute 1 t Lemon Juice.</li>
