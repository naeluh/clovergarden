  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>TOOR DAL</b> to reduces foaming. Fastest is to shake 
    vigorously in a wire strainer under running hot water. Put in a 
    sauce pan with 1 cup <b>WATER</b> and bring to a boil uncovered. 
    Turn to a very low simmer, cover tightly and simmer for 35 to 45 min 
    until cooked through. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Use a vegetable peeler to peel the thin but hard rind from the 
    <b>OPO GOURD</b>. Cut into about 3/8 inch (1 cm) dice, or as you 
    prefer. Tumble with <b>TURMERIC</b> to coat.
    </li>
  <li>Cap all 3 <b>RED CHILIS</b>, cut in half lengthwise and remove 
    the seed cores. Leave in the membranes so they provide some heat. 
    Cut one half of one into narrow strips, reserving them for the Tadka. 
    Chop the rest coarse.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>COCONUT</b> and run in a food processor or blender until 
    very fine, add <b>Urad Dal</b>, the chopped <b>Red Chilis</b>, 
    <b>Cumin Seeds</b>, and <b>Rice</b>. Continue processing. Add Water 
    a little at a time until you achieve a smooth paste 
    (see <a href="imp_opokoot1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Tadka items</b>, except Oil.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Cook <b>Opo Gourd</b> in 2 cups <b>WATER</b> until tender, about 
    10 minutes when it will be mostly translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Toor Dal</b> until thoroughly mixed, then stir in 
    <b>Coconut Paste</b> and <b>Salt</b> to taste. Cook, stirring 
    occasionally, for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
  <li>In a small pan heat <b>Oil</b> and add <b>Tadka mix</b> (careful, 
    the Curry Leaves will snap and spit for a few seconds). Fry stirring 
    until Mustard Seeds are popping well, then stir into the Kootu.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tuvar Dal] &nbsp; This is peeled and split 
  Pigeon Peas. Use the un-oiled, the oiled is obsolete. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Opo Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; [Bottle Gourd] &nbsp; Usually sold here as 
  "Opo Squash", this gourd is now quite common in North America. In 
  India, Snake Gourd would often be used, but it isn't commonly available 
  in North America yet. Loofa (smooth or angled), or Fuzzy Melon could 
  also be used, as well as other vegetables. For Fuzzy Melon and Snake 
  Gourd, you can just scrape off the thin skin rather than peeling.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos which are 
  easily available, but other medium hot red chilis could be used. As 
  given, chili heat is faint - if you want more, chop up a hot green 
  chili and add it to the mix.for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fresh Coconut. If all you have 
  is dried (unsweetened!) 1/4 cup of fine grated with 1/4 cup water, 
  soaked for at least 20 minutes, will give you 3 ounces. Coarse grated 
  you'll need about 1/3 cup. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconuts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [White Lentils] &nbsp; These are tiny beans, 
  split and peeled, often used in India as a seasoning ingredient. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a week or so). If you don't have them you will have to leave them 
  out - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you 
  use, because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Paste:</h3> &nbsp; My Mini-Prep food processor was just adequate 
  for producing the paste, going back and forth between "chop" and 
  "grind". The Coconut still had some texture, but that's normal.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A Kootu is similar to a Sambar, but a bit 
  dryer.</li>
