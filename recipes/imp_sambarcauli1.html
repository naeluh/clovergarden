Sambars appear in most meals in Southern India. They are a stew 
of toor dal with vegetables and spicing, and are delicious. Finish with a 
"tadka", a sort of aromatic garnish that gets swirled in. See also

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into moderate size florettes</li>
  <li>Wash <b>TOOR DAL</b> in a wire strainer under hot running water 
    (the washing reduces foaming). Put in a sauce pan with 2 cups 
    <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil uncovered (to prevent foaming over). 
    Turn to a very low simmer, cover and simmer for 45 min (or longer if 
    you want it very smooth as they do in India - I like a bit more 
    texture). Simmer uncovered a bit if necessary - there should be 
    almost no free water when it is done.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks, mix with 
    <b>Sambar Powder</b> and <b>Turmeric</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir enough water into <b>Rice Flour</b> to suspend it as you would 
    with corn starch.</li>
  <li>Make the seasoning paste: &nbsp; Put <b>Oil</b> in a small frying 
    pan and bring it up hot. Fry <b>Coriander</b>, <b>Peppercorns</b> and 
    <b>Urad Dal</b> until Urad starts to color. Take the pan off the heat 
    and immediately stir in <b>Asafoetida</b> and cool. Put in a heavy 
    mortar with <b>COCONUT</b> and about 1 T <b>Water</b>. Pound to a 
    fine paste.</li>
  <li>Mix Tadka: &nbsp; Split the <b>RED CHILI</b> lengthwise and mix with <b>Mustard 
    Seeds</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b> (if you have them). Have this all 
    ready for the last moment before serving.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Put <b>Cauliflower</b> in a sauce pan with enough water to about 
    1/3 cover. Stir in <b>Tomato Mix</b> and bring to a simmer until 
    Cauliflower is nearly done (about 10 minutes).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spice Paste</b>, <b>Rice Flour</b> and <b>Cooked Dal</b>. 
    Stir in <b>Salt</b> to taste and simmer a few minutes to blend.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Coconut Milk</b> and adjust liquid as needed - Sambars should 
    be fairly liquid. Bring back to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Tadka: heat <b>Oil</b> in a small pan. Fry <b>Mustard Seed Mix</b> 
    stirring until mustard seeds are popping well (just a few seconds). 
    Pour over the sambar and give it a swirl.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tuvar Dal] &nbsp; This is peeled and 
  split Pigeon Peas. For a lighter flavor you could use Moong Dal- 
  peeled and split Mung Beans. Both these are available at any market 
  serving an Indian community. If your Toor Dal is old, it will not 
  cook tender.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sambar Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important masala in 
  southern India. It can be purchased, but is better made at home. 
  Here is our recipe <a href="iys_masalsp02.html"><b>Sambar 
  Powder #2</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This tiny white dal is split and peeled 
  urad beans (black gram). It is easily available in any market serving 
  an Indian community. If you don't have it, leaving it out will not make 
  a lot of difference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In India, a person would anoint their rice 
  with warm Ghee (clarified butter), and then would mix in some Sambar. 
  It would be served with several other dishes, all used in modest 
  portions with the rice (the main dish). On the Western table it is 
  more likely to be served in larger amount as a vegetarian main dish. 
  I serve it in a bowl, with a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on the 
  table, to be spooned into the Sambar as desired. There would probably 
  be only one other dish, perhaps a salad.</li>
