Delicious Sambars appear in most meals in Southern India. They are a 
stew of toor dal (usually) with vegetables and spicing. Preparation takes 
some time, but can all be done even a day ahead. See also

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hr - 55 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>TOOR DAL</b> in <b>Water</b> to cover for 20 minutes. 
    Drain and rinse in several changes of water (the washing reduces 
    foaming). Put in a sauce pan with 2 cups <b>Water</b> and bring to 
    a boil uncovered (to prevent it from foaming over). Turn to a very 
    low simmer, cover and simmer until it has the consistency you want. 
    In India they like it very smooth, but I like a bit more texture. It 
    can take 1 to 3 hours depending how old the Toor Dal is and the 
    desired texture. There should be little free water when it is done.
    </li>
  <li>Prepare <b>Tamarind</b> as needed (see 
    <a href="imp_sambfuzm1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>);
  <li>Wipe the prickly fuzz off <b>FUZZY MELON</b>. Scrape off green peel 
    and cut into 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Shallots</b> and chop fine. Crush <b>Garlic</b> and chop 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into about 1/2 inch chunks. Mix all 
    <b>Tomato mix items</b>.</li>
  <li>Make the seasoning paste: &nbsp; Put <b>Oil</b> in a small frying 
    pan and bring it up hot. Fry <b>Coriander</b>, <b>Peppercorns</b> and 
    <b>Urad Dal</b> until Urad starts to color. Take the pan off the heat 
    and immediately stir in <b>Asafoetida</b>, then let it cool. Add 
    <b>Coconut</b> and about 1 T <b>Water</b>. Pound to a fine paste in 
    a heavy mortar.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Tempering items</b></li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a coverable 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat 2 t 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b>. When Curry Leaves have 
    sputtered out and Mustard Seeds start to pop (chilis should be 
    darkened but not blackened), stir in <b>Shallot mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring until they soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>, <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>, <b>Tamarind</b> 
    and 1 c <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer slowly 
    for about 15 minutes or until Fuzzy Melon is fairly tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Toor Dal</b> and <b>Seasoning Paste</b>. Bring 
    back to a simmer and simmer for about 4 minutes or until Fuzzy 
    Melon is tender enough.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid as needed. Sambars should be fairly liquid to go 
    well with rice.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice. This dish reheats 
    well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Qua (China)] &nbsp; Actually a gourd, 
  this is an immature form of the giant Ash Gourd or Winter Melon. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html"><b>Fuzzy 
  Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tuvar Dal] &nbsp; This is peeled and 
  split Pigeon Peas. For a lighter flavor you could use Moong Dal- 
  peeled and split Mung Beans. Both these are available at any market 
  serving an Indian community. If your Toor Dal is old, it will not 
  cook tender.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is 
  concentrate in a jar, use 3 T. If it's block form use about 3 T, 
  soak 1/2 hour in 3/4 cup warm water and press through a strainer 
  (use all the liquid). If you don't have tamarind use 3 t lemon 
  juice - not the same, but it's something. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sambar Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important masala in 
  southern India. It can be purchased, but is better made at home. 
  Here is our recipe <a href="iys_masalsp02.html"><b>Sambar 
  Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Indian Reshampatti 
  is appropriate. It is fairly hot and has good flavor. 1 t makes this 
  Sambar "satisfyingly hot" by Southern California standards. If in 
  doubt, use half as much, or use Kashmir powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This tiny white dal is split and peeled 
  urad beans (black gram). It is easily available in any market serving 
  an Indian community. If you don't have it, leaving it out will not make 
  a lot of difference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In India, a person would anoint their rice 
  with warm Ghee (clarified butter), and then would mix in some Sambar. 
  It would be served with several other dishes, all used in modest 
  portions with the rice (the main dish). On the Western table the Sambar 
  would likely be served beside the rice and in a larger amount as a 
  vegetarian main dish. I do it this way and stir the Sambar into the 
  Rice as I eat. There would probably be only one other dish, perhaps a 
  chicken, fish, or meat dish.</li>
