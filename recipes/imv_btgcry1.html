  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>Toor Dal</b> and place in a pan with about 1-1/2 cups of 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil uncovered (or it'll foam over). Simmer 
    covered over low flame for about 45 minutes until the Dal is tender. 
    Be sure it doesn't run low on water, there should still be a fair amount 
    when it is done. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut up <b>TAMARIND</b> as best you can and pour over 1 cup of <b>Warm 
    Water</b>. Let sit for at least 20 minutes. Force through a strainer, 
    discarding all the solids.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BITTER GOURD </b> in half lengthwise, scoop out seed mass, 
    and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Separately dry toast all <b>Spices items</b> and pour out on a plate 
    to cool. Then grind all together. Just toast Coriander and Pepper until 
    aromatic. The two Dals should be toasted to a light golden color. The 
    Chilis should have plenty of dark splotches, but no burning.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasonings items</b>.</li>
  <li>For Garnish: in a very small pan, heat <b>Ghee</b> and fry 
    <b>Cashew Halves</b> stirring until light golden. Set the pan aside 
    to use for the Tempering step.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Tempering items</b> <u>except</u> Oil.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, place <b>Tamarind Juice</b>. 
    Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Add <b>Bitter Gourd</b> and 
    <b>Seasonings mix</b>. Simmer over low heat until the Gourd is tender, 
    around 15 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Spices mix</b> and return to a simmer 
    for a minute or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Toor Dal</b> and stir gently until well distributed.
    </li>
  <li>In a very small pan, heat 2 t <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Tempering 
    mix</b>, carefully as the Curry Leaves will pop and spit for a few 
    seconds. When the <b>Mustard Seeds</b> are popping well, stir into the 
    Curry.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, bring it up to a simmer. Stir in <b>Coconut 
    Milk</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (Thai Jasmine is closer to 
    the rice used in Tamil Nadu than Basmati is). This dish reheats well, 
    but don't bring quite to a boil.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bitter Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for a whole gourd, as purchased. 
  Here I presume the common smoothly warty Chinese style. The pattern recipe 
  clearly calls for the sharply warty Indian style, and rather small ones. 
  She calls for "2 or 3 (125 grams)" and doesn't mentioning seeding them. 
  If you use those, you may want to cut back an ounce or so, as they are 
  more bitter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter Melon / Bitter Gourd</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tovar Dal, Red Gram, Arhar] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Pigeon Peas, available in any market serving an Indian community. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html">
  <b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Weight and instruction presumes Block Form. If 
  you are using Concentrate, mix 2 ounces with 1/2 cup water.  For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> This is split and peeled Bengal Gram (Desi type 
  Chickpeas). For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html">
  <b>Chickpeas (Bengal / Desi type)</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This tiny white dal is split and peeled 
  urad beans (black gram). It is easily available in any market serving 
  an Indian community. If you don't have it, leaving it out will not make 
  a lot of difference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili, Dry Red:</h3> &nbsp; I suggest the standard Japones here. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sambar Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important masala in 
  southern India. It can be purchased, but is better made at home. 
  Here is our recipe <a href="iys_masalsp02.html"><b>Sambar 
  Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Jaggery:</h3> &nbsp; optional, see <a href="imv_btgcry1.html#13"><b>Comments</b></a>. 
  This is unrefined cane sugar sold in cakes. If you don't have it, use some 
  other partially refined sugar or omit it.</li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Black Mustard Seeds are always 
  used. If you have only Yellow, they will work but pop more violently and 
  at a slightly lower temperature.</li>  
<li id="10">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Use a high quality "full cream" coconut 
  such as Aroy-D from Thailand. This will provide the "thick coconut milk" 
  called for by the pattern recipe. Shake it up well before adding to the 
  recipe, especially if using a partial can.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 1 Tablespoon of 
  Jaggery (sugar), which I thought excessive and cut it in half. That turned 
  out to be still excessive, so I've cut it to a teaspoon and consider it 
  optional. Two things going here - Asians are sugar junkies, and they like 
  Bitter Melon, but keep trying to reduce its biterness with sweet. This 
  recipe already makes the bitterness very slight without any sugar. The 
  pattern recipe called for 1-1/2 cups of grated fresh coconut, to soak in 
  hot water, run in a processor, and squeeze for the "thick coconut milk". 
  I chose to use an 8 ounce can of Aroy-D coconut milk, which is plenty 
  "thick".</li>
