An excellent vegetable curry that will not disappoint. Cauliflower is a 
prestige vegetable in India. For spiciness, 
use your own best judgement, and see the notes.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into smallish florets.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Make Masala: &nbsp; Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice 
    <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut slices into slivers and chop fine. Mix in a Mortar 
    with <b>Salt</b> and pound into paste. Grind <b>Spices</b> and mix into 
    Paste along with <b>Chili Flake</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li><b>Optional:</b> &nbsp; In a kadhai or wok, Heat enough <b>Oil</b> 
    for deep frying - see <a href="imv_caulcry2.html#07"><b>Deep Frying</b></a>. Fry 
    <b>Cauliflower</b> in batches, tumbling until golden. Remove and 
    drain on paper towels. This will add 15 minutes to the time given here.
    </li> 
  <li>Heat 2 T of <b>Oil</b> over moderate flame (you can use the same pan 
    and 2 T oil from deep fry). Stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until 
    getting translucent, then stir in <b>Masala</b> for 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato Sauce</b> and <b>Finish Spices</b>. Fry stirring 
    until bubbling well (see <a href="imv_caulcry2.html#06"><b>Tomatoes</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cauliflower</b> until well distributed. then stir in 
    <b>Water</b> to almost cover it. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer over 
    low heat until Cauliflower is tender. Time depends on whether you have 
    deep fried the Cauliflower - up to 15 minutes for raw. Toss just once or 
    twice during simmering so you don't break up the florets.</li>
  <li>When done, adjust <b>Salt</b> if needed.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Basmati rice. This dish reheats well, but 
    won't be quite as bright red.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cauliflower:</h3> &nbsp; Cauliflower in India was developed from 
  European varieties, but is now somewhat different. It tends to be light 
  yellow to cream colored and has a stronger flavor. Cooking qualities are 
  similar, so European types work well in Indian recipes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for pur&eacute;eing the 
  Onions, but I've found pur&eacute;ed Onions tend to be bitter, a bitterness 
  that requires overcooking to get rid of - and I like more texture in my 
  curries anyway.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; In the two places you can use the same or 
  different Chili Flake / Powder. For the photo example I used Aleppo Extra 
  Hot (very similar to Kashmir) in both cases, and this produced very low 
  chili heat. For myself I'd use Indian Khandella or Reshampatti in one or both 
  places for more heat. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for pur&eacute;eing 
  "two medium tomatoes" (with no hint as to how much a "medium tomato" weighs 
  in Bihar). For best flavor, I prefer using a convenient 8oz can of a very 
  simple tomato sauce. My favorite is "Faraon Spanish Style", but other 
  simple sauces will also work, even Goya "Spanish Style", if you aren't still 
  boycotting them for enthusiastically endorsing Trump on TV.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is the name of the finishing spice mix 
  used throughout India - but made very differently from one region to 
  another, and even from household to household. For a version appropriate to 
  Bihar, see our recipe <a href="iys_gmjhar1.html"><b>Garam Masala - 
  Bihar</b></a>, but others may be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for frying the Tomatoes 
  "until it dries out". This is very common in India and Africa, usually 
  stated "fry the tomatoes stirring until the oil begins to separate". They 
  say this removes the "bitter taste" from the Tomatoes. I've never tasted 
  bitterness in tomatoes, but what this really removes is the fresh tomato 
  flavor. I recommend against this practice.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Deep Frying:</h3> &nbsp; In India, deep frying is extremely popular, 
  and many households have oil and a kadhai ready at all times. The pattern 
  recipe called for deep frying the Cauliflower, but admitted you might not 
  want to. Here in Southern California, we don't do deep frying regularly, 
  so it's a hassle. I did the photo example with the deep fry, but don't 
  think it's worth the bother, and it adds 15 minutes to the cooking time.
  </li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe includes all the same ingredients and 
  in the same quantities as the pattern recipe, except the noted Tomato sauce 
  instead of Tomatoes. They have, however, been handled in a way I prefer. The 
  original recipe can be found on page 80 of the book indexed as bhok in our 
  bibliography (see top of index).</li>
