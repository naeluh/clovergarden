Green Tomatoes are a popular vegetable in India. While having little 
chili heat, this is not a dish for timid tastes, but certainly worthwhile 
for the adventurous.  See also <a href="imv_gntomsbj1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>GREEN TOMATOES</b> into about 3/4 inch wide wedges, then 
    cut the wedges into sections about 3/4 inch long, 2 or 3 pieces 
    per wedge depending on tomato size.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PEANUTS</b> into crunchy little bits in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Separately dry toast <b>CUMIN</b> and <b>CORIANDER</b> just long 
    enough to be aromatic and darken just a shade. Pour out on a plate 
    to cool. When cool, grind them together in your spice grinder. 
    <u>Immediately</u> divide the ground spices in half so you won't 
    forget.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Mix together all <b>Powders items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> quite hot. Stir in 
    <b>Tempering mix</b> and let it sputter for just 20 seconds, 
    then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring over medium heat until 
    Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Powders mix</b> until Onions are well coated, 
    then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and 1/2 the <b>Spices mix</b> 
    until all is evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Turn heat to low. Cover tightly and sweat the Tomatoes, stirring 
    now and then, until tender, about 12 minutes. They should still 
    have a bit of crunch.</li> 
  <li>Stir in the other 1/2 of the <b>Spices mix</b>, the <b>Peanuts</b> 
    and the <b>Jaggery</b>. Adjust liquid if needed. This should be a 
    dryish dish, but I like a little more liquid if serving with rice. 
    Cook covered another 5 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>. Accompany with Roti or 
    Paratha - or with Basmati rice if you prefer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are unripe 
  regular tomatoes, not "Mexican Green Tomatoes" (Tomatillo) which are 
  not actually tomatoes. The tomatoes should be solid green or with a 
  slight white or pink blush. Riper tomatoes can be used, but must be 
  very hard. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomato.html"><b>Tomatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seed is always 
  used, but yellow will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic, but is 
  also often combined with onions. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are two 
  forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or ground) and the more common 
  "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut with rice flour. The amount 
  given here is for pure asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much if what 
  you have is the "powder" form. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; I use Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  makes this dish quite mild by Southern California standards, but, if 
  in doubt, use Kashmir. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Jaggery:</h3> This is a partially refined cane sugar, much used in 
  India, sold in various shaped cakes. If you don't have it, use a 
  similar partially refined sugar. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sweet.html"><b>Sweeteners</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A Sabji or Bhaaji is a vegetable dish, what 
  we might think of as a side dish - but this dish has the impact of a 
  main dish. I have cut the amount of sugar to 1/4 what was called for 
  by the pattern recipe, and consider that more than enough. South Asian 
  dishes often need the sugar cut way back for Western tastes - as well 
  as for health.</li>
