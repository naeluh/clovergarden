Green Tomatoes are a popular vegetable in India.  This dish is moderately 
spiced, emphasizing the vegetable. For a more intensely spiced (but less 
chili hot) version see <a href="imv_gntomsbj1.html"><b>Green Tomato 
Sabji #1</b></a>. See also <a href="imv_gntomsbj2.html#08"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>GREEN TOMATOES</b> into about 3/4 inch wide wedges, then 
    cut the wedges into sections about 3/4 inch long, 2 or 3 pieces 
    per wedge depending on tomato size.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Grind <b>CORIANDER</b> in your spice grinder and mix together all 
  <b>Powders items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> quite hot. Stir 
    in <b>Tempering mix</b> and let it sputter for just 20 seconds, 
    then stir in <b>Chili mix</b>. Fry stirring over medium heat until 
    aromatic, no browning, then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring 
    until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Powders mix</b> until Onions are well coated, 
    then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> until all is evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Turn heat to low. Cover tightly and sweat the Tomatoes, stirring 
    now and then, until tender, about 12 minutes. They should still 
    have a bit of crunch.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Jaggery</b>. Adjust liquid if needed. This should be a 
    dryish dish, but I like a little more liquid if serving with rice. 
    Cook covered another 5 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>. Accompany with Roti or 
    Paratha - or with long grain rice if you prefer (south Indian or 
    Thai Jasmine).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are unripe 
  regular tomatoes, not "Mexican Green Tomatoes" (Tomatillo) which are 
  not actually tomatoes. The tomatoes should be solid green or with a 
  slight white or pink blush. Riper tomatoes can be used, but must be 
  very hard. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomato.html"><b>Tomatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The hot green chilis used in India 
  much available here, so we use Serranos. One half to one Serrano, 
  according to taste, size and hotness (these can be treacherous). 
  Combined with the chili powder this will make the dish a little hot by 
  Southern California standards. Use your own best judgement. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic, but is 
  also often combined with onions. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are two 
  forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or ground) and the more common 
  "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut with rice flour. The amount 
  given here is for pure asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much if what 
  you have is the "powder" form. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; I use Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  makes this dish quite mild by Southern California standards, but, if 
  in doubt, use Kashmir. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp;  This is a spice mix used in every 
  Indian household, but there are many variations. Here is a recipe for 
  <a href="iys_masaltn1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Tamil Nadu</b></a> 
  typical for the cuisines of southern India. If you don't have it on 
  hand, using a northern Garam Masala won't change the taste much.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Jaggery:</h3> This is a partially refined cane sugar, much used in 
  India, sold in various shaped cakes. If you don't have it, use a 
  similar partially refined sugar. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sweet.html"><b>Sweeteners</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A Sabji or Bhaaji is a vegetable dish, what 
  we might think of as a side dish - but this dish can easily stand as 
  a vegetarian main dish. I have cut the amount of sugar to less than 
  1/4 what was called for by the base pattern recipe, and consider that 
  more than enough. South Asian dishes often need the sugar cut way back 
  for Western tastes - as well as for health. I have modified procedures 
  a little, in keeping with other recipes for this dish, and added Onion 
  which most other recipes have. I have identified this recipe as from 
  southern India by the use of Curry Leaves, which are tropical and not 
  used in the north.</li>
