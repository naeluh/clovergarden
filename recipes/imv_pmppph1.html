A relatively dry squash dish that's very interestingly spiced, and not too 
chili hot. It's great as a vegetarian main dish for two, served with rice, 
or as an appetizer.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>"Pumpkin":</h3> &nbsp; (Kabocha Squash) &nbsp; Weight is peeled and 
  seeded. This is what a "Pumpkin" is almost everywhere except North America. 
  In India, the Kabocha would be called a "Red Pumpkin" from it's deep orange 
  inside color. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sq_kabochz.html">
  <b>Kabocha Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Chili</h3> &nbsp; What small red chili you use can be quite hot,
  or not. It will not greatly affect the chili hotness of the finished dish.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Panch Phoron:</h3> &nbsp; This is a mix of whole spices used as a 
  Tempering. It can be made in 5 minutes - see our recipe 
  <a href="iys_panchp1.html"><b>Panch Phoron</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; For northern India, a mild Chili Powder is 
  appropriate. 1/2 teaspoon of Kashmir is barely noticeable in this recipe. 
  Use your own best judgement here.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is the traditional cooking oil of 
  Bengal and north central India. It is handled differently from other 
  oils. Mustard oil is heated in the pan with no other ingredients until 
  it reaches a temperature where the first wisps of smoke appear 
  (about 480&deg;F/250&deg;C). Immediately take it off the heat and 
  allow to cool to a more reasonable frying temperature (around 
  360&deg;F/180&deg;C) before adding other ingredients. This procedure 
  removes the acrid taste of the raw oil and renders it quite pleasant. 
  Mustard oil is available in markets serving an Indian community. It 
  will always be labeled "For Massage Use Only" due to lack of FDA 
  approval, based on reasons no longer considered valid. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for sweating the Pumpkin 
  in it's own liquid, but our properly aged Kabochas have flesh that's too 
  dry, so they need some water. The dish should finish up with little liquid.
