  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1.1 hrs - 14 minutes less if you don't 
    skin the peppers)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>PEANUTS</b> in a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer until Peanuts are cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Opt: &nbsp; Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush the 
    skins off under running water - see <a href="imv_pprpnt1.html#08"><b>Peppers</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Cap and Core <b>Bell Peppers</b> cut into about 1/2 inch squares.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Paste A items</b>.</li>
  <li>Heat 2 t <b>Oil</b> in a small pan. Add <b>Paste A mix</b> and fry 
    over moderate heat until fragrant and the Dal is light golden. Take 
    off the heat and stir in <b>Paste B items</b>.</li>
  <li>Run <b>Paste mix</b> in a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> 
    or Blender until smooth.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering</b> items.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>Jaggery</b> (if needed) and mix with 1 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Rinse <b>Bell Peppers</b> and drain well. We just want a light coating 
    of water on them.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, coverable kadhai, or wok, heat 2 t 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> (careful, the Curry Leaves will 
    snap and spit for a few seconds) and fry stirring until <b>Mustard 
    Seed</b> are popping well.</li>
  <li>Stir in wet <b>Bell Peppers</b>, cover and sweat them over moderate 
    heat, stirring a couple of times, until they are crisp tender. Remove 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir into the pan <b>Jaggery mix</b>, <b>Paste mix</b>, and 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Peanuts</b> and <b>Peppers</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    another 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of Steamed Rice or Roti. Thai Jasmine rice will 
    do, unless you have patience to wait 1-1/2 hours for Rose Mata rice to 
    steam. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ri_indiz.html"><b>South 
    Asian Rice</b></a> page.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, Red Dry:</h3> &nbsp; The standard Japones will work fine, 
  adding interest, but very light heat. Use hotter chilis if you prefer. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html">
  <b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; This presumes block form, just cut from the block 
  and chopped. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Coconut, Grated:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe presumes fresh grated, 
  but frozen is fine. If you have only dry grated, measure the same amount 
  and soak 20 minutes in half the volume of water.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; this is the Indian temperature gage, 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Jaggery:</h3> &nbsp; This is Indian partially refined cane sugar. 
  If you don't have it, use a dark brown sugar.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The blasting and skinning step is not in the 
  pattern recipe - households in India would not have the torch, but you 
  should. This step improves the texture, but more important, if part of 
  the dish is reheated (almost always the case for me), it prevents very 
  annoying curled pepper skins from floating around in the sauce. With the 
  recommended <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> this 
  skinning process takes 14 minutes and the peppers remain raw.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  This recipe could stand a little more liquid 
  than shown in the photo example. This recipe has the minimum amount of 
  Jaggery, it could be as much as a full Tablespoon if you want sweeter. 
  Some recipes use a lot more, but warn it is too sweet to serve with 
  rice, only roti. The garnish in the photo is dry pan toasted peanuts.
