<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach Stems:</h3> &nbsp; 6 ounces is about what you get in stems 
  from 1 pound of spinach. "Spinach" (Palak) in India is actually a 
  form of beet leaf. &Uuml;ber-expert Julie Sahni recommends Swiss Chard 
  (a beet green) for the leaves, but that won't work for the stems, so 
  we use regular Spinach for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ch_amaranth.html"><b>Amaranths</b></a> page, 
  particularly <b>"Perpetual Spinach Chard"</b>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Moong Dal:</h3> &nbsp; (Green Gram) These are split and peeled 
  green Mung Beans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_mungz.html"><b>Mung Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; In India black mustard seed is always 
  used, but yellow will work. This is the Hindu temperature gage, when 
  they're popping well the oil is hot enough (440&deg;F/225&deg;C or a 
  little higher).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is split and peeled Indian 
  Chickpeas (Bengal Gram). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas, Desi type</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; (Black Gram, White lentils)This is one of 
  the most important beans in India and often appears in the seasoning 
  mix for recipes from Southern India. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili, Dried Red</h3> &nbsp; Dried red chilis from India aren't 
  much available in North America, at least not properly identified. 
  Most sold in Indian markets are Japones, or similar, and are not as 
  hot as most Indian chilis. Dry red De Arbols are a good substitute, 
  or Japones for less heat, or Thai for more heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> These leaves, only useful if fresh or frozen, 
  are becoming increasingly available in Indian markets in North America. 
  They are essential to the authentic flavor of Southern Indian cuisine 
  and there is no substitute - so if you don't have them you'll just have 
  to leave them out. No, bay leaves are <u>not</u> a suitable substitute. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Reshampatti is a good choice for this 
  southern dish, and will provide noticeable bite. Korean will work (use 
  a little more) or Cayenne (use a little less). For  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, Basmati is the famous rice of India, but 
  that's way up north and in Pakistan. Southern India, where Curry Leaves 
  and Chilis are popular, is too tropical for Himalayan basmati. Long 
  grain rice like Thai Jasmine is more appropriate.</li>
