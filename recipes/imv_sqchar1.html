This is a fairly dry curry, with the sweetness from squash and onion 
countered by chard and chili, with yogurt providing a light sour note. 
The generous portion of Black Cumin gives it an unusual aroma.

    stems.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> small. Slice

  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, wok or kadhai, heat 
    <b>Mustard Oil</b> until you see the first wisp of smoke. Take off

    about 10 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winter Squash:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after peeling, as yield from 
  different squash can vary significantly. The photo example used almost 
  half a large green Hubbard squash, but other  winter squash will do 
  fine too, especially Kabocha. For details, see our  
  <a href="../ingred/squash.html"><b>Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chard, Red:</h3> &nbsp; The measure is chopped fine and very 
  lightly packed. You will need to start with a bundle weighing about 
  12 ounces, a little more if it's real stemmy.</li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Indian cookbooks always give chilis by 
  count - and never provide any hint as to how big or how hot they 
  should be. I use 1 Chili Serrano for this recipe which I don't think 
  needs to be any hotter than that. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Cumin:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>! &nbsp; This is a special 
  version of cumin with very small long seeds. It is <u>NOT</u> nigella, 
  often sold as "black cumin". For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_cuminz.html"><b>Cumin</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This oil is needed for the true taste of 
  Bengal and Kashmir cuisines. It is available in any market serving an 
  Indian community. If you use some other oil, do not heat it up to 
  smoking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for no water, but I 
  found it needed. This will depend on your squash and cooking time - 
  adjust as needed.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is highly clarified butter, available from 
  stores serving an Indian, Middle Eastern or North African community. 
  Buy Butter Ghee only, Vegetable Ghee is often trans fats. If you must 
  use oil, avocado oil has a more buttery taste than others. For details 
  see our recipe <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Bengali garam masalas 
  are very simple compared to those of northern India, see our recipe 
  <a href="iys_gmbong1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Bengali</b></a>. If 
  you have  only a northern style GM, it certainly won't ruin the dish.
