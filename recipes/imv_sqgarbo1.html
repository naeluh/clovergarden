Delicious and satisfying as a vegetarian main dish served with steamed 
Basmati rice, this recipe's spicing is mild enough so it can also serve 
as a side dish for Western cuisine. I'm usually not a big squash fan, 
but I find this recipe excellent.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9-1/2 hrs - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>GARBANZOS</b> about 8 hours with 1/4 teaspoon of salt 
    (yes, salt). Drain and rinse, then cook until tender but not at 
    all mushy.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Peel <b>SQUASH</b>, scrape out the seed mass and dice about 
    1/2 inch on a side, or as desired.</li>
  <li>Core <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> and cut into strips up to 2 inches long 
    and 3/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> quite small.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Turmeric</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Yogurt</b> and <b>Garam Masala</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tadka items</b> in a tiny pan. The Bay Leaves 
    and Cinnamon Stick should be broken up into a several pieces.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, wok or kadhai, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Onion</b> and <b>Spice Paste</b> stirring for about 2 minutes, 
    then stir in <b>Squash</b>, <b>Bell Pepper</b> and 
    <b>Turmeric mix</b>. Fry stirring over fairly high heat for about 
    4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chickpeas</b> and <b>Yogurt mix</b> until well blended. 
    Cover tightly and simmer slowly, stirring a couple of times, until 
    squash is tender but not at all mushy. This may be 15 to 30 minutes 
    depending on your squash. I don't like my curries too dry, so I 
    included 1 T of water as well.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b> and get it ready to serve.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Tadka</b> up to frying temperature for about 1 minute, 
    then pour it over the Squash (see <a href="imv_sqgarbo1.html#09">Note-9</a>).</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winter Squash:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after peeling, as yield from 
  different squash can vary significantly. The photo example used almost 
  half a large green Hubbard squash, but other  winter squash will do 
  fine too, especially Kabocha. For details, see our  
  <a href="../ingred/squash.html"><b>Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chickpeas:</h3> &nbsp; Garbanzos in California, Kabuli Chana in 
  India. These are best soaked overnight with a little salt and cooked, 
  but a good brand of canned beans could be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chickz.html"><b>Chickpeas (Kabul Type)</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; This is an adaption used in the source 
  recipe, a substitute for the Parval or Pointed Gourd 
  used in Bengal. The flavor is different, but texture and color are 
  similar. Parval are seldom available even here in Los Angeles. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gourds.html"><b>Gourds</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Bengali garam masalas are very simple 
  compared to those of northern India, see our recipe 
  <a href="iys_gmbong1.html"><b>Garam Masala - Bengali</b></a>. If 
  you have only a northern style GM, it certainly won't ruin the dish.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Spice Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is simple - see our recipe for 
  <a href="iiv_gicuco1.html"><b>Ginger Cumin Coriander Paste</b></a>. 
  You can make up a batch - or, just as much as you need for this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lemon Juice:</h3> &nbsp; This is my addition. While very good, 
  the recipe seemed to lack something. This fixed it.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is highly clarified butter,available from 
  stores serving an Indian, Middle Eastern or North African community. 
  Buy Butter Ghee only, Vegetable Ghee is often trans fats.  If you must 
  use oil, avocado oil has a more buttery taste than others.  For details 
  see our recipe <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Cinnamon Stick:</h3> &nbsp; Use real Cinnamon if at all possible. 
  The Cassia Bark sold as Cinnamon in the United States won't work well 
  - it's too thick and hard for the short frying time of a Tadka. Real 
  Cinnamon can be found in markets selling Mexican herbs and spices, 
  because that's what's used in Mexico. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Tadka:</h3> &nbsp; In India, people eat everything with their 
  fingers, and can easily feel and deal with the debris from the Tadka. 
  This is not the case in North America, so you are justified in 
  straining it before pouring over the squash. If I'm serving buffet 
  style, I just strain the Tadka and stir it in right after the Lemon 
  Juice.</li>
