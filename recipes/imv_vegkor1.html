Kormas are braised dishes with a thick sauce. They are usually made with 
meats, but this vegetable one from Tamil Nadu is outstanding. This can be 
a <a href="imv_vegkor1.html#09"><b>Make-Ahead</b></a> dish.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/8 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold water, 
    peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice thin on a diagonal.</li>
  <li>Thaw frozen <b>PEAS</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into smallish size florets.</li>
  <li>Paste-A: &nbsp; Dry pan roast <b>Chana Dal</b> until lightly golden. 
    let cool. Mix all <b>Paste-A items</b> and grind to powder in a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, Spice Grinder, or 
    pound in large stone Mortar.</li>
  <li>Paste-B: &nbsp; Prepare <b>COCONUT</b> as needed (see <a href="imv_vegkor1.html#03">
    <b>Coconut</b></a>). Crush <b>Almonds</b>. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> small. 
    Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut slices into threads and chop fine. 
    Mix all and reduce to paste in a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html">
    <b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender. You can add enough water to make a 
    loose paste.</li>
  <li>Blend <b>Paste-A</b> into <b>Paste-B</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>. All ingredients remain whole.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="12">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt), heat <b>Ghee</b> and 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> (careful, Curry Leaves will 
    snap and spit for a few seconds) and fry stirring until seeds are aromatic.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>. Fry stirring until Onions 
    are translucent.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in along with <b>Carrots</b>. Sprinkle 
    with <b>Turmeric</b> and fry stirring another minute or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Paste mix</b>, then <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover, 
    and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cauliflower</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, and <b>Salt</b>. Bring back 
    to a boil and simmer covered until Potatoes are tender, about another 10 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garam Masala</b>, <b>Peas</b>, and <b>Cilantro</b> for 
    another 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice (much closer to South 
    India rice than Basmati is). This full recipe will provide 6 9oz servings.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Poppy Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, white Poppy Seeds are always used, 
  and are available in markets serving an Indian community. Some older 
  recipes call for a lot of them as a thickener, as they were cheap and 
  plentiful. Today, due to poppy growing restrictions, they are expensive.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut, Grated:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh grated of frozen are fine. If you 
  have only dry grated (unsweetened), measure the same volume, add half that 
  volume of water, and let soak at least 10 minutes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe asks for 4 Green Chilis, 
  without any hint as to how big or how hot they should be. I suggest 1 Chili 
  Serrano for this recipe, which should be OK for most people. If you want 
  more heat, make it two. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cassia Bark:</h3> &nbsp; This is what passes for Cinnamon north of the 
  Mexican border, as well as in China and Southeast Asia. 1 stick is about 
  2-3/4 inches. It is better for stews than Cinnamon because it doesn't break 
  up into splinters. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html">
  <b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is highly clarified butter, available from 
  stores serving an Indian, Middle Eastern or North African community. 
  Buy Butter Ghee only, Vegetable Ghee is often trans fats. If you must 
  use oil, avocado oil has a more buttery taste than others. For details 
  see our recipe <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but varies a 
  lot from region to region, and some from one household to another within 
  the regions. For this recipe <a href="iys_masaltn1.html">
  <b>Garam Masala - Tamil Nadu</b></a> would be most appropriate, but others 
  could also be used.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Make Ahead</h3> &nbsp; This recipe reheats well, but to preserve color, 
  if you make it ahead, hold the Peas and Cilantro to add after reheating.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; It is important the Tomatoes not go in until 
  Potatoes are at least half done, because their acid will harden the surface 
  of raw Potatoes.</li>
