Delicious, but powerful! "Jeera" means "Cumin", and it's well flavored with 
that spice, and chilis too. In southern India Rasams are drizzled onto 
rice, but see <a href="iov_rasamj1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Dissolve <b>TAMARIND</b> in 1 c nearly boiling water for 
    at least 30 minutes. Press through a fine strainer and discard the 
    solids. Be sure to scrape the outside of the strainer as some 
    paste will cling there.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water, quench in cold water and 
    chop fine.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Sambar Podi</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b> 
    into Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin Seeds</b>, <b>Toor Dal</b> and <b>Red Chili</b> 
    in your spice grinder. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a sauce pan, place <b>Tamarind juice</b> and <b>Tomato mix</b> 
    and 1-1/2 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and 
    simmer slowly for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>. Bring up almost to a simmer, 
    uncovered. Turn off heat.</li>
  <li>In a tiny skillet, heat <b>Oil</b>, <b>Mustard Seeds</b> and 
    <b>cumin seeds</b> until Mustard Seeds are popping well. Stir 
    in <b>Curry Leaves</b>. When they stop sputtering, pour into 
    Rasam.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>, and with steamed Jasmine 
    rice (see <a href="iov_rasamj1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>). Jasmine rice is much 
    closer to rice used in southern India than is Basmati.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; The amount is for block 
  form, which should always be used for rasams as it is more flavorful 
  than concentrate. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rasam Podi:</h3> &nbsp; For an easy to make recipe from the region of 
  this recipe see our <a href="iys_rasamch1.html"><b>Rasam Podi 
  Chettinad</b></a>. A Sambar Podi could also be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Toovar Dal, Red Gram Dal, Arhar Dal] &nbsp; 
  This is split and peeled Pigeon Peas, available from markets serving an 
  Indian community. Do not buy the oiled version. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05"><h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I use a de Arbols which 
  are a fairly hot chili. A regular Japone chili would make it a little 
  less hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In India, Rasam is served drizzled over rice, 
  which is eaten with the fingers (tricky). Traditionally, they don't have 
  spoons in India, but we have spoons. It's much more practical for us to 
  serve the Rasam in soup bowls and place a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on 
  the table to be spooned in as desired. Other experienced cooks have also 
  recommended this. This does mean a lot more Rasam will be taken and less 
  rice. With a 6 oz serving, leaving plenty of room for rice, this recipe 
  is 4 portions, or 3 at 8 ounces.</li>
