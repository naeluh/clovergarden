<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "3 
  whole dry Kashmiri red chilis". Real Kashmiris are almost impossible 
  to get in India, so I don't know what substitute is implied. I used 
  5 Indian Byadagis, often used to make "Kashmir Powder", but most won't 
  have these either. Perhaps 3 California or New Mexico chilis will do, 
  and perhaps a teaspoon of Hungarian Paprika for more color. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tur Dal, Toovar Dal] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Pigeon Peas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. Do not buy the 
  version preserved with oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Split Bengal Gram] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Bengal Chickpeas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas Bengal / Desi 
  Type</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; The amount is for prepared liquid. <u>IF</u> 
  using block form, which is more flavorful than concentrate, cut off 
  2 ounces from the block and chop as best you can. Pour near boiling 
  water over to cover and let soak for 45 minutes or more, breaking it 
  up a bit. When soaked, press it through a wire strainer using the 
  backside of a wooden spoon. Collect all that goes through, including 
  scraping the outside of the strainer. Discard the debris. Use all 
  of it, it'll be the right amount even if not 1/4 cup. For concentrate, 
  use 1/4 cup. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Rasam Powder:</h3> &nbsp; [Rasam Podi] &nbsp; If you already have 
  a Rasam Podi you like on hand, you can use it. This recipe makes about 
  2-1/2 Tablespoons. For another recipe, see our 
  <a href="iys_rasamch1.html"><b>Rasam Podi Chettinad</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; A really good way to serve this is to place 
  <a href="ibg_idli1.html"><b>Idlis</b></a>, perhaps 4 of them, 
  overlapping a bit in a dish deep enough to hold some liquid. Then, 
  pour a generous ladle of the Rasam over them. This recipe makes 
  enough for about 64 idlis served this way. Fortunately it keeps well 
  in the fridge, and can be brought back to a boil every 5 days or so.
