In India, Rasams are drizzled over rice, which is eaten with the fingers, but 
for us they are peppery soups, often tart and well spiced (see <a href="iov_raslem1.html#08">

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water, quench in cold water and 
    chop fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut slices into narrow threads and 
    chop threads fine. Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine. Mix together all
    <b>Seasonings items</b>.</li>
  <li>Break <b>Red Chili</b> in half and shake out as many seeds as will 
    go. Mix together all <b>Tempeing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> small for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Wash <b>Toovar Dal</b> (reduces foaming). Place in a sauce pan with 
    <b>Turmeric</b> and 3 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil uncovered, 
    cover and simmer over low heat until almost all texture is lost. 
    This will take 1-1/2 hours, and you may still want to hit it with an 
    immersion blender (I do).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and 1 cup water. Bring up to a boil and 
    simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a tiny skillet, heat <b>Ghee</b> and stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> - 
    Careful, the Curry Leaves will snap and spit for a few seconds. When 
    Mustard Seeds are popping well, stir into the Rasam.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Rasam</b> back to a boil. Take off the heat and stir in 
    <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> and with steamed Jasmine rice 
    (see <a href="iov_raslem1.html#08"> <b>Serving</b></a>). Jasmine rice is much closer to 
    that used in Southern India than Basmati is.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toovar Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Toor Dal, Red Gram Dal, Arhar Dal] &nbsp; 
  This is split and peeled Pigeon Peas, available from markets serving an 
  Indian community. Do not buy the oiled version. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Hot green Indian chilis are imperfectly 
  available even here in Los Angeles. Our standard substitute is the Serrano, 
  which is larger, hotter, and has more flavor. If you need to reduce heat, 
  remove the seed core and as much of the veins as you think necessary - 
  use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rasam Podi:</h3> &nbsp; For an easy to make recipe from the region of 
  this recipe see our <a href="iys_rasamch1.html"><b>Rasam Podi 
  Chettinad</b></a> recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; this is the Indian temperature gage, 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into tadka at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Chili, dried:</h3> &nbsp; There's not enough of this to make a 
  big impact on the Rasam. A regular Japone chili will do fine. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In India, Rasam is served drizzled over rice, 
  which is eaten with the fingers (tricky). Traditionally, they don't have 
  spoons in India, but we have spoons. It's much more practical for us to 
  serve the Rasam in soup bowls and place a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on 
  the table to be spooned in as desired. Other experienced cooks have also 
  recommended this. This does mean a lot more Rasam will be taken and less 
  rice. With a 6 oz serving, leaving plenty of room for rice, this recipe 
  is 4 portions, or 3 at 8 ounces.</li>
