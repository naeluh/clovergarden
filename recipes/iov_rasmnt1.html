In India, Rasams are drizzled over rice, which is eaten with the fingers, but 
for us they are peppery soups, often tart and well spiced (see <a href="iov_rasmnt1.html#07">

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place all <b>Paste A</b> items in a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html">
    <b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender and run to powder.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>MINT LEAVES</b> from stems. Measure is firmly packed. Chop 
    <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine. Add both to the Mixie or Blender along with 
    3 T <b>Water</b> and run to a smooth paste.</li>
  <li>Break <b>Red Chili</b> in half and shake out as many seeds as will 
    go. Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> small for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Wash <b>Toovar Dal</b> (reduces foaming). Place in a sauce pan with 
    <b>Turmeric</b> and 3 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil uncovered, 
    cover and simmer over low heat until almost all texture is lost. 
    This will take a least 1-1/2 hours, and you may still want to hit it 
    with an immersion blender (I do).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Paste mix</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring back to a simmer for 
    another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a very small pan, heat <b>Ghee / Oil</b> and stir in <b>Tempering 
    mix</b> - careful, the Curry Leaves will snap and spit for a few seconds. 
    When Mustard Seeds are popping well, stir into the Rasam.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Rasam</b> back to a boil. Take off the heat and stir in 
    <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> and  with steamed Jasmine 
    rice (see <a href="iov_rasmnt1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>). Jasmine rice is much closer 
    to that used in Southern India than Basmati is.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toovar Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Toor Dal, Red Gram Dal, Arhar Dal] &nbsp; 
  This is split and peeled Pigeon Peas, available from markets serving an 
  Indian community. Do not buy the oiled version. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Hot green Indian chilis are imperfectly 
  available even here in Los Angeles. Our standard substitute is the Serrano, 
  which is larger, hotter, and has more flavor. If you need to reduce heat, 
  remove the seed core and as much of the veins as you think necessary - 
  use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; this is the Indian temperature gage, 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into Tadka (Tempering) at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Red Chili, dried:</h3> &nbsp; There's not enough of this to make a 
  big impact on the Rasam. A regular Japones chili will do fine. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In India, Rasam is served drizzled over rice, 
  which is eaten with the fingers (tricky). Traditionally, they don't have 
  spoons in India, but we have spoons. It's much more practical for us to 
  serve the Rasam in soup bowls and place a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on 
  the table to be spooned in as desired. Other experienced cooks have also 
  recommended this. This does mean a lot more Rasam will be taken and less 
  rice. With a 6 oz serving, leaving plenty of room for rice, this recipe 
  is 4 portions, or 3 at 8 ounces.</li>
