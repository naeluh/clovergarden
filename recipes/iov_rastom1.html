In India, Rasams are a second course, drizzled over rice, eaten with the 
fingers, but see <a href="iov_rastom1.html#09"><b>Serving</b></a>. Most of the Prep time 
is for chopping tomatoes - a processor will give you a different texture.

    pan with 1 cup <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil uncovered, then 
    cover tightly and simmer slowly for at least 1-1/2 hours. Stir several 
    times during the last 30 minutes. Set aside. </li>
  <li>Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Powders items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a sauce pan (3 qt is good), heat <b>Ghee</b> quite hot. Stir 
    in <b>Tempering mix</b>. When mustard seeds start to pop (about 20 
    seconds), stir in <b>Chili mix</b>, followed by <b>Tomatoes</b> 
    and 1 cup <b>Water</b>. Stir in <b>Powders mix</b>, bring to a boil 
    and simmer 5 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These need to be very good quality fully 
  ripe tomatoes, for both taste and color. Get them from a grower or 
  Farmer's Market if possible. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomato.html"><b>Tomatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Toovar Dal, Red Gram Dal, Arhar Dal] &nbsp; 
  This is split and peeled Pigeon Peas, available from markets serving an 
  Indian community. Do not buy the oiled version. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Hot green Indian chilis are imperfectly 
  available even here in Los Angeles. Our standard substitute is the Serrano, 
  which is larger, hotter, and has more flavor. If you need to reduce heat, 
  remove the seed core and as much of the veins as you think necessary - 
  use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; In India, Dahni chilis would be used, which 
  are essentially the same as our Thai Chilis, but the common Japones 
  could also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee is easily available in markets serving an 
  Indian or North African community. Accept only Butter Ghee - Vegetable 
  Ghee is often deadly trans fats. If you can't get (or can't accept) 
  butter ghee, use oil. Avocado Oil would be best but Pure Olive Oil 
  (not virgin) will work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_gheez.html"><b>Ghee</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In India, Rasam is served drizzled over rice, 
  which is eaten with the fingers (tricky). Traditionally, they don't have 
  spoons in India, but we have spoons. It's much more practical for us to 
  serve the Rasam in soup bowls and place a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on 
  the table to be spooned in as desired. Other experienced cooks have also 
  recommended this. This does mean a lot more Rasam will be taken and less 
  rice. With a 6 oz serving, leaving plenty of room for rice, this recipe 
  is 4 portions, or 3 at 8 ounces.</li>
