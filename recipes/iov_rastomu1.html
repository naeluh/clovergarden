In India, Rasams are a second course, drizzled over rice, eaten with the 
fingers, but see <a href="iov_rastomu1.html#10"><b>Serving</b></a>. Most of the Prep time 
is for chopping tomatoes - a processor will give you a different texture.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> fine, but not to a pur&eacute;e.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>TOOR DAL</b> in several changes of water. Put in a sauce 
    pan with 1 cup <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil uncovered, then 
    cover tightly and simmer slowly for at least 1-1/2 hours. Stir several 
    times during the last 30 minutes. Set aside. </li>
  <li>IF your <b>TAMARIND</b> is paste, chop and soak in just boiled 
    water for at least 1/2 hour. Force it through a wire strainer, 
    keeping liquid and pulp, discarding fiber.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Powders items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a sauce pan (3 qt is good), heat <b>Coconut Oil</b> quite hot. 
    Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b>. When mustard seeds start to pop (about 
    20 seconds), stir in <b>Chili</b>, followed by <b>Tomatoes</b> 
    and 1 cup <b>Water</b>. Stir in <b>Powders mix</b>, bring to a boil 
    and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Toor Dal</b> (including liquid) and 1-1/2 cup 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring back to a boil and it is ready.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>. Accompany with steamed 
    long grain rice (Thai Jasmine is fine) - see <a href="iov_rastomu1.html#10">

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These need to be very good 
  quality fully ripe tomatoes, for both taste and color. Get them from 
  a grower or Farmer's Market if possible. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomato.html"><b>Tomatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split 
  Pigeon Peas, also called Tuvar Dal and Red Gram (for the flowers). 
  This is available at any market serving an Indian community. Buy the 
  unoiled. For details and cooking method see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind 
  is concentrate in a jar, use 2 T, or if it's block use about 2 T, soak 
  and strain. If you don't have tamarind use 4 T lemon juice - not the 
  same, but it's something. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The hot green Jwala chilis used in India 
  are not much available even here in Los Angeles, so we use Serranos. 
  One will be just noticeable depending on how hot the individual chilis 
  are (like all chilis they are quite variable). Most of the heat in this 
  recipe comes from the Rasam Podi. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Udupi Rasam Podi</h3> &nbsp; This important masala is much used in 
  Udupi cuisine for Rasams and for other types of dishes. It is easily 
  made at home by our recipe <a href="iys_rasampu1.html">
  <b>Rasam Podi Udupi</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Coconut Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This oil, once condemned as a heart killer, 
  is now recognized as outstandingly healthy. It is easily available in 
  markets serving South and Southeast Asian communities, as well as from 
  Yuppie outlets like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In India, Rasam is served drizzled over rice, 
  which is eaten with the fingers (tricky). Traditionally, they don't have 
  spoons in India, but we have spoons. It's much more practical for us to 
  serve the Rasam in soup bowls and place a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice on 
  the table to be spooned in as desired. Other experienced cooks have also 
  recommended this. This does mean a lot more Rasam will be taken and less 
  rice. With a 6 oz serving, leaving plenty of room for rice, this recipe 
  is 4 portions, or 3 at 8 ounces.</li>
