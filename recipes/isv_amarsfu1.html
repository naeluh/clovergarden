This flavorful stir fry of greens is from the very strict vegetarian 
cuisine of Udupi, in Karnataka, on the west coast of India. It is similar 
to a Western spinach side dish, but with more flavors and a firmer 
texture.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>If using block form <b>TAMARIND</b>, dissolve in 3 T nearly boiling 
    water for 30 minutes or more. Strain, discarding the solids. If using 
    concentrate, just measure out 1-1/2 Tablespoons.</li>
  <li>Pinch off <b>AMARANTH</b> leaves and tender tips, leaving leaf 
    stems behind. Rinse leaves, spin dry in you salad spinner and chop 
    fairly small. You should end up with at least 1 pound. Don't worry 
    about the huge pile, it will cook down until you worry about not 
    having enough.</li>
  <li>If you want significant chili bite, chop a serrano chili fine 
    and mix it in with the amaranth.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasonings items</b>, breaking up <b>Chili</b> 
    coarsely.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Salt</b>, <b>Jaggery</b> and <b>Turmeric</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok, kadhai or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> 
    quite hot. Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> (careful, the curry leaves 
    will splatter). Fry stirring until mustard seeds are popping well.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Amaranth</b> until coated with oil, then stir 1/4 cup 
    <b>Water</b> and <b>Jaggery mix</b>. Cover tightly and simmer over 
    low heat until until Amaranth is tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Tamarind</b>, <b>Rasam Powder</b> and <b>Coconut</b>. 
    Take off heat</li>
  <li> Serve hot with steamed Basmati or Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Amaranth:</h3> &nbsp; These greens are available in 
  markets serving South and Southeast Asian communities. For details see 
  our  <a href="../ingred/ch_amaranz.html"><b>Amaranth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; The amount is for block 
  form. Concentrate isn't as flavorful, but if that's what you have, 
  use 1 Tablespoon. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seeds are 
  always used (except brown in Bengal), but the yellow ones will 
  work if you don't have black.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Urad Dal</h3> &nbsp; This is split and peeled black urad beans. 
  The dal is very white compared to other dals, and is available in any 
  Indian market.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I use a de Arbol which is a fairly hot 
  chili, but with just one the recipe is still very mild. 
  If you want hotter, chop a green Serrano fine and mix with the 
  amaranth. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Jaggery</h3> &nbsp; This is an unrefined sugar 
  which comes in lumps or cones. It is needed to counter the natural 
  bitterness of the amaranth. It's available in any Indian market.
  The version used in the photo example was sold as "Gur", which should  
  properly be palm sugar. Indian terminology is rather inconsistent, 
  but it did taste like palm sugar.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Udupi Rasam Podi:</h3> &nbsp; [Saarina Pudi] 
  This powder is used not only in Rasams (sour tamarind soups) but in 
  many other Udupi recipes. It is easy to make. See our recipe 
  <a href="iys_rasampu1.html"><b>Rasam Podi</b></a>.</li>
