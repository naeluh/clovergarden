  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Break the <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into rather small florets.</li>
  <li>Slice the <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1/4 to 3/8 in pieces including the 
    green part, chop the <b>CHILI</b> fine and mix both with <b>Turmeric</b>, 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in 
     the <b>Mustard Seeds</b>. When the seeds start to pop stir in the 
     <b>Urad Dal</b> and fry stirring until dal is very lightly colored.
     </li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Scallion mix</b> and fry stirring for about 10 
    seconds, then stir in <b>Cauliflower</b> and fry stirring until 
    cauliflower is fairly uniformly yellow from the Turmeric, add 1/2 cup 
    <b>Water</b>, bring quickly to a simmer, then cover and simmer over 
    low heat, stirring just once or twice, until Cauliflower is just getting 
    tender, about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Uncover, turn heat up and and let the water evaporate. Continue to fry 
    turning only a couple of times until ingredients are just starting to 
    brown. <u>Resist the urge to stir too much or you'll mush your 
    cauliflower</u>.</li>
  <li>Check salt to taste and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Scallions</h3> &nbsp; This number is for scallions about 1/2 inch 
  diameter (about 8 ounces total). If yours are much larger or smaller 
  adjust the number you use.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Chili</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses Fresnos, but other 
  medium red chilis like Holland Red will work. Red Indian chilis are 
  seldom available even here in Los Angeles. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>. page</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds</h3> &nbsp; In India black mustard seeds are used, 
  but yellow ones will work. They not only provide flavor, but their 
  popping tells you the oil is hot enough.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal</h3> &nbsp; This is a tiny, very white dal made from 
  split and peeled black urad beans, very commonly used in southern 
  India both as dal and as a seasoning. It is available in any market 
  serving an Indian community, but if you don't have it, leaving 
  it out won't have a large effect on the recipe.</li>
