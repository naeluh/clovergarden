This flavorful curry of eggplant and fenugreek greens is popular in 
Bengal. It is a very simple recipe which works well as a side dish or as 
a light vegetarian main dish with rice - if you don't mind slightly 
bitter greens (see <a href="isv_epmethi1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min (mostly stripping greens))
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>METHI</b>. Pick off leaves and tender tips, discarding 
    tough stems. If there are immature seed pods, take them too (they 
    are so long an thin they look like blades of grass. You should end 
    up with somewhere near 10 ounces (see <a href="isv_epmethi1.html#06">
    <b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Bunch up the <b>Methi</b> and, holding tightly, slice the bunch 
    thin with a very sharp knife. This is easier and  more consistent 
    than chopping, but use care - blood is not an authentic ingredient 
    in this dish.</li>    
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> as you wish - this varies with the cook. For 
    the photo example I cut into pieces roughly 3/4 inch on a side. There 
    is no need to peel these eggplants. If you will not be frying them 
    immediately, hold in water acidulated with Lemon Juice or Citric 
    Acid.</li>
  <li>Split <b>CHILIS</b> lengthwise from under the cap to the tip. Mix 
    with <b>Kalongi</b> and <b>Methi Seeds</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Eggplants</b> if they have been held in water.</li>
  <li><b>ONLY IF</b> using <b>Mustard Oil</b> (<a href="isv_epmethi1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>), heat in the saut&eacute; pan until the first 
    trace of smoke, then turn off heat and let cool just a little.</li>  
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b>
    quite hot. Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> just until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplants</b> and fry stirring until they are cooked 
    through and getting quite soft. Add a little water if it seems too 
    dry, especially if the eggplants were not held in water.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Methi</b> leaves and <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring over 
    moderate heat until Methi is wilted and cooked through (3 to 5 
    minutes).</li>
  <li> Serve hot with steamed long grain rice or Chapatis.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Methi Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Methi is Fenugreek. You may be 
  familiar with the seeds, used as a spice, but in India, the Near and 
  Middle East, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, the greens 
  are much used. Given that ethnic mix, you can be sure there is no 
  shortage of fresh methi greens here in Los Angeles. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_fenugz.html"><b>Fenugreek</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp;  I use the small Indian eggplants which are 
  very available here in Southern California, but Italian, Japanese or 
  similar thin skinned eggplants will work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html#var"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The Indian green chilis sold around here are 
  often too mild, and not always available, so I use Serranos, which 
  are highly available in North America. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is the traditional cooking oil of 
  Bengal and north central India. It is handled differently from other 
  oils. Mustard oil is heated in the pan with no other ingredients until 
  it reaches a temperature where the first wisps of smoke appear 
  (about 480&deg;F/250&deg;C). Immediately take it off the heat and 
  allow to cool to a more reasonable frying temperature (around 
  360&deg;F/180&deg;C) before adding other ingredients. This procedure 
  removes the acrid taste of the raw oil and renders it quite pleasant. 
  Mustard oil is available in markets serving an Indian community. It 
  will always be labeled "For Massage Use Only" due to lack of FDA 
  approval, based on reasons no longer considered valid. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Methi Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is common Fenugreek seed, found in 
  the spices section of most markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_fenugz.html"><b>Fenugreek</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; There is no fixed ration between Methi and 
  Eggplant. The recipe given here is at the high limit for Methi. 
  Persons unaccustomed to bitter greens may wish to increase the Eggplant 
  and reduce the Methi a bit. A few recipes add a little Jaggery 
  (unrefined sugar) to counter the bitterness. Many recipes add "a pinch" 
  of Turmeric, but this has no effect on the bitterness.</li>
