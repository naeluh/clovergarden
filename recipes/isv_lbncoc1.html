A tasty side dish, but too light for a main dish. Thorans (Malayalam) or 
Poriyal (Tamil) are served as side dishes, along with rice and a curry or 
similar main dish.

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into lengths of 1/2 to 3/4 inch. If using 
    Green bean, 1/4 to 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Shallots</b> and <b>Chili</b> small. Mix together all 
    <b>Paste items</b>. In a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a>, 
    Blender, or Mini Food Processor run to a somewhat coarse paste.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok, kadhai, or other suitable pan, heat <b>Coconut Oil</b>. 
    Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> (careful, the Curry Leaves will snap and 
    spit for a few seconds) and fry stirring until the mustard seeds are 
    popping well.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beans</b>. 1/3 c <b>Water</b>, and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to 
    a boil stirring a couple of times. Cover and reduce to a simmer until, 
    stirring now and then, until Beans are tender. Green beans take less 
    time than Long Beans. There should be a little free water left.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Paste mix</b> until well distributed and well heated.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Rice and a Curry, Sambar, or similar main dish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Long Beans</h3> &nbsp; These are available in produce markets that 
  serve an Asian community, and now even some that don't. These should be 
  cut between 1/2 to 1/3 inch long depending on diameter, thicker shorter 
  than thinner. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html">
  <b>Long Beans</b></a> page. Regular <a href="../ingred/bp_greenz.html">
  <b>Green Beans</b></a> are also used, but these should be cut a bit 
  shorter, and the cooking time is significantly less.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Coconut, Grated:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe presumes fresh grated, 
  but frozen is fine. If you have only dry grated (unsweetened), measure the 
  same amount and soak at least 10 minutes in half the volume of water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Hot Indian Green Chilis are not reliably 
  available, even here in Los Angeles, so we use Serranos. One whole 
  Serrano makes this recipe fairly sharp. If you wish less, remove the 
  seed mass and some or all the veins - use your own best judgement. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html">
  <b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split Urad Beans. They are 
  easily available in markets serving a significant Indian community. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The main difference between a Thoran (Karala) 
  and a Poriyal (Tamil Nadu) seems to be that the Thoran requires Coconut 
  Oil, where a Poriyal may use Coconut Oil or some other oil. The garnish 
  in the photo example is dry pan roasted peanuts.</li>
