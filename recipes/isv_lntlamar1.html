<p>You can make this recipe vegetarian by omitting the fish.</p>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>AMARANTH</b>. Pick off leaves and tender tips, discarding 
    stems, including leaf stems. You should end up with at least 2 
    ounces. Place in a saucepan.</li>
  <li>Pick over <b>Red Lentils</b> as needed, wash in several changes of 
    water and add to the Amaranth.</li>
  <li>Open can of <b>COCONUT MILK</b> without shaking it. Spoon out 3 T 
    of the coconut cream on the top and reserve. Pour the rest and 1 cup 
    <b>Water</b> in with the Lentils.</li>
  <li>Break open <b>CHILIS</b> and pour out the seeds. Break up the shells 
    and add to the Lentils.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>MALDIVE FISH</b> in your spice grinder or pound to a 
    powder in a mortar (1/4 ounce is about 2 t). Add along with 
    <b>Turmeric</b> to the Lentils.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Onion</b>, cut in quarters lengthwise, then slice crosswise 
    very thin. Peel off outer leaves of <b>Lemon Grass</b> and cut off 
    the tough root end. Whack the lowest 4 inches good with your kitchen 
    mallet and cut off the leaf end high enough to keep the whacked part 
    from falling apart. Mix together <b>All Finish Items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Bring <b>Lentils</b> to a boil and simmer until done. Stir 
    frequently and add Water as needed. In Sri Lanka "done" is a thick 
    soup consistency, but I like my lentils a little more identifiable 
    so I simmer 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a skillet heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Finish mix</b> over very moderate heat, stirring until onions are 
    very lightly colored.</li>
  <li>When <b>Lentils</b> are done, stir <b>Finish mix</b> and <b>Coconut 
    Cream</b> in with them. <b>Salt</b> to taste and simmer another 10 
    minutes, uncovered.</li>
  <li>Fish out the Pandanus and Curry leaves, lemon grass and cinnamon 
    (chopsticks work well for this). Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Amaranth:</h3> &nbsp; These greens are available in markets 
  serving Southeast Asian communities. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/ch_amaranz.html"><b>Amaranth</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Thai chilis or Arbols will work fine, 
  or for less heat use Japones. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Maldive Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Smoked, fermented and dried fish broken 
  up into pieces with the appearance and hardness of old wood splinters. 
  If you don't have it, use Japanese Bonito Flakes - same fish 
  processed the same way just cut differently. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfshdry.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted &amp; 
  Smoked</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pandanas Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These leaves can be found in the 
  frozen food sections of markets serving Southeast Asian communities, 
  and sometimes fresh here in Southern California. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pd_pandan.html"><b>Pandanus - Screw Pine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lemon Grass</h3> &nbsp; Stalks of fresh lemon grass are now 
  available in North America in markets serving a Southeast Asian 
  community. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html">
  <b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; The appropriate oil is Coconut Oil, but Pure 
  Olive Oil (not virgin) or similar can be used.</li>
