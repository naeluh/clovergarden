  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Toss <b>OKRA</b> with <b>Vinegar</b> to coat. Let sit for 20 minutes 
    tossing a couple times to keep them coated. This helps them stay intact 
    and non-slimy. Drain and rinse.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>  
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> small - see <a href="isv_okrppr1.html#02"><b>Chilis, Green</b></a>.
    </li>
  <li>Cap <b>Okra</b> and cut about 3/4 inch on a fairly steep diagonal.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok. Heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> fairly hot. Stir 
    in <b>Okra</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes. Remove and drain on 
    paper towels.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and bring up hot. Stir in <b>Cumin 
    Seeds</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b>. Careful, the curry leaves will snap 
    and spit for a few seconds.  When the Cumin Seeds are quite aromatic, 
    stir in the <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until starting to get 
    translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Chilis</b>. Fry stirring another 2 
    minutes.</li>
 <li>Stir in the <b>Okra</b>. Cover and let the Okra steam over fairly low 
   heat. Let steam until Okra is cooked through and as tender as you want 
   it, it should still have a little crunch.</li>
 <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> for a minute and take off the 
   heat.</li>
   </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select fairly small firm, dark colored Okras, as 
  large ones and old ones can be fibrous. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mw_okraz.html"><b>Okra</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, Green:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 2 Green Chilis, 
  but the long thin chilis in the photos are not available here in Los Angeles, 
  and I have no idea how hot they are. I use 1 <b>Serrano</b> (they are larger 
  and quite hot). I cut the cap off, then cut the Chili in half lengthwise. I 
  core it, removing seeds and membranes. Just for me I may leave in some 
  membranes for more heat. I then chop it small. Chili sensitive people may 
  wish to use only half - use your own best judgement for preference and 
  type of Chili. Some recipes use dried red chilis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a medium grind. Adjust 
  quantity to taste, but it should be at least one teaspoon.</li>
