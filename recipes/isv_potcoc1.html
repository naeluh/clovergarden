  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>POTATOES</b> until just cooked through. Peel off the skins 
    and cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch chunks. There will be some crumbling, but 
    that works well for this recipe.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>COCONUT</b> fine. If using dried grated coconut, use 1/4 
    cup and soak in water for at least 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Spicing items</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Break <b>Dried Red Chili</b> in half and dump out as many seeds as 
    will go. Mix all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li>

  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat. Stir in <b>Tempering mix</b> - careful, the Curry Leaves will snap 
    and spit for a few seconds. Fry stirring until Mustard Seeds are popping 
    well and Dal have a little color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Spicing mix</b>. Fry, tumbling gently, 
    until Potatoes are well coated with the spice mixes - about 3 minutes.

  <li>Sprinkle <b>Coconut</b> over and tumble until evenly distributed.

  <li>Serve warm as a side dish or appetizer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose and Red Potatoes work well for 
  this method of cooking. Yukon Gold type can be used here, but don't 
  overcook or they'll be mush. The flavor is different and they don't 
  have those in India. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Coconut, Grated:</h3> &nbsp; The recipe calls for "fresh grated", 
  (or frozen) but you can use dried (unsweetened and fine grated) giving 
  it at least 20 minutes soaking in warm water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  are fairly hot, and in this amount it will be noticeable. Use your own best 
  judgement as to amount and hotness. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Dry Red:</h3> &nbsp; use any small chili, like Japone, it won't 
  make much difference in the heat of the dish.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Seed:</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seed is always used, 
  but yellow can be used if you don't have black.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is split and peeled urad beans (black gram). 
  It is available in markets serving an Indian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is split and peeled Bengal Gram (Desi type 
  Chickpeas). For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html">
  <b>Chickpeas (Bengal / Desi Type)</b></a>.</li> 
<li id="08">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into tempering at the last moment. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Chana Dal and Urad Dal are important to the 
  flavor and texture of the dish, but as made they are quite hard.  If you 
  will be serving folks with compromised teeth, make this dish a day ahead 
  and let it sit in the fridge overnight. The Dal will be quite softened 
  the next day.</li>
