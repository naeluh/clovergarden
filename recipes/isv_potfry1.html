Much like American pan roasted potatoes but with a lot more flavor. In 
Southern India this recipe would be made with Taro. Serve warm or at 
room temperature, a good buffet dish.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min - 8 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes 3/4 to 1 inch on a side. 
    Put them in a pot with plenty of lightly salted water, bring to a 
    boil and cook until the cubes are just cooked through. Drain well 
    and hold until needed.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>CHILIS</b> and break in half. Crush <b>CHANA DAL</b> 
    lightly into pieces similar to the Urad Dal. Mix together 
    <b>All Spices</b> items.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a large, well seasoned iron skillet or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> 
    hot. Stir in <b>Spices mix</b> (careful, the Curry Leaves will 
    splatter a bit) and fry stirring until mustard seeds start to pop.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>. See also 
    <a href="isv_potfry1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a> for method.</li>
  <li>Fry over decreasing heat, turning gently every few minutes until 
    potatoes are nicely golden (about 30 minutes). It should not smoke 
    at any time.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with <b>Sambar Powder</b> and serve warm. If you think 
    it's already as hot as your guests can take, you can skip the 
    Sambar Powder without ruining the recipe, but I prefer the extra 
    flavor. In my opinion, a sprinkle of lime juice would go well with 
    these too.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, which are firm enough to 
  survive the frying without crumbling. Red potatoes are a little more 
  delicate but could work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page. If you 
  use Taro (available in markets serving any community of tropical 
  origin), the process is pretty much the same. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_taroz.html"><b>Taro / Colocasia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dal:</h3> &nbsp; Chana is peeled and split chick peas (the 
  small Indian ones); Urad, (black gram) are tiny and very white, 
  though the beans they are split from are black. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_legumev.html"><b>Beans, Peas &amp; 
  Lentils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Thai chilis or Arbols will work fine 
  and make the dish fairly hot. If you have doubts, use the common 
  Japones which are not as hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Coconut oil is appropriate for the region, and 
  what I use - though our de-odorized coconut oil from the Philippines 
  is a little different from what they use in southern India. Pure 
  Olive Oil (not virgin) can also be used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sambar Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is a little 
  different from the Porial powder called for by the original recipe, but 
  pretty similar. so why stock yet another masala? Here's our 
  recipe for <a href="iys_masalsp02.html"><b>Sambar Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I'm usually making this with 5 to 7 pounds of 
  potatoes, so I do it a little differently than in India. I cook and 
  drain the potatoes as above. I heat the appropriate amount of oil to 
  400&deg;F/200:&deg;C in a smaller skillet and pour in the 
  <b>Spices mix</b>. When the curry leaves have settled down and the 
  mustard seeds start to pop well I pour it all into an electric skillet 
  and add the <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>. I then 
  fry at abut 275&deg;F/135&deg;C, shuffling them around frequently 
  until lightly browned. The electric skillet is very good for frying 
  potatoes, it's non-stick, has excellent temperature stability, and it 
  leaves the stove free for other uses. The photo example was pan fried, 
  thus not so evenly browned.</li>
