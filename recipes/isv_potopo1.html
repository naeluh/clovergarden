    side and 1 to 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into pieces Of about the same size 
    as the Opo. Mix with <b>Opo</b> and keep in cold water to cover 
    until needed.</li>

  <li>Drain <b>Potato mix</b>.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> using <b>Mustard Oil</b>, heat it in a coverable kadhai, 
    wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan until you see the first wisps of 
    smoke. Immediately take it off the heat and allow to cool to a

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Opo Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; [Lauki, Dodhi, Bottle Gourd] &nbsp; This 
  gourd is commonly available in produce stores in North America. Many 
  recipes say you can substitute Zucchini for Opo, but this is not true 
  - zucchini will turn to mush, opo will not. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose and Red Potatoes work well for 
  this method of cooking. Yukon Gold type can be used here, though the 
  flavor is different and they don't have those in India. For details, 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into tempering at the last moment. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Amchur:</h3> &nbsp; Used as a souring agent, this is a powder made 
  from dried unripe mangos. It is available in markets serving an Indian 
  community. If you don't have it, use 3 T Lemon Juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; 1/2 teaspoon Khandela or Reshampati 
  will make this dish moderately hot by Southern California standards. 
  If in doubt, use Kashmiri powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is the traditional cooking oil of 
  Bengal and north central India. It is handled differently from other 
  oils. Mustard oil is heated in the pan with no other ingredients until 
  it reaches a temperature where the first wisps of smoke appear (about 
  480&deg;F/250&deg;C). Immediately take it off the heat and allow to 
  cool to a more reasonable frying temperature (around 
  360&deg;F/180&deg;C) before adding other ingredients. This procedure 
  removes the acrid taste of the raw oil and renders it quite pleasant. 
  Mustard oil is available in markets serving an Indian community. It 
  will always be labeled "For Massage Use Only" due to lack of FDA 
  approval, based on reasons no longer considered valid. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/oi_mustz.html"><b>Mustard Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A Subzi [Sabzi, Sabji] is a simple, 
  relatively dry, vegetable stir fry.</li>
