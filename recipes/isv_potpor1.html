<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes, Tiny:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for tiny 
  "New Potatoes", Then calls for them to be peeled after cooking. Real 
  "New Potatoes" have paper thin skins and are never peeled. They aren't 
  much available here in Southern California, anyway. The really tiny potatoes 
  we get here have tough skins, so I used some white potatoes with thinner 
  skins that are a little larger, up to 1-3/8 inches diameter. I have also 
  used somewhat larger Red Potatoes cut into quarters. Red potatoes have 
  thinner skins than white. I see no reason this recipe couldn't be made with 
  larger White Rose potatoes, peeled and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split Urad Beans. They are 
  widely used in Indian cuisines, so easily available in markets serving a 
  significant Indian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 2 Tablespoons 
  of mild chili powder made from Goondu Milagai chilies, only available around 
  Chettinad. I used half their amount of Aleppo Hot, which is a good stand-in 
  for Indian Kashmiri powder, and found the resulting heat just right - but 
  the chili adverse may wish to cut it down a bit. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is from a famous restaurant 
  in Chettinad. Restaurant recipes are often a bit "difficult", because they 
  reflect the unique environment of the restaurant (kitchen staff, etc.), 
  not a home kitchen. I have restepped this recipe to be more in keeping with 
  other Indian recipes.</li>
