This recipe may have originated around Mumbai, but 
the region of India where it is now most popular is England. Cooking 
methods vary (see <a href="isv_potspin1.html#05"><b>Note-4</b></a>) but the ingredients 
remain pretty much the same. Chard was used for the photo.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Put in cold 
    water and bring to a boil until they are just cooked through.</li>
  <li>Float wash and stem <b>SPINACH</b> (or Chard) and cut into narrow 
    strips. Drop into plenty of rapidly boiling water and parboil until 
    just limp (2 min for spinach, 4 min for chard). Cool and squeeze 
    out excess water, then fluff it so it's not all in a lump.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, then chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop fine. Slice <b>Chili</b> thin and chop fine. Mix all with 
    <b>Salt</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Optional, but better flavor: heat <b>Oil</b> in a well seasoned 
    iron skillet. Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and fry over gentle heat, 
    turning about every 5 minutes until lightly browned on all sides. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b>.  Stir in <b>Mustard Seeds</b> and <b>Cumin 
    Seed</b>. fry stirring until mustard seeds start to pop, 
    then stir in <b>Ginger mix</b> for about 1 minute, followed by 
    <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until onions show just a trace of color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and cook stirring over low heat until potatoes 
    are thoroughly warmed, then stir in <b>Spinach</b> and cook 
    another 3 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Red Potatoes and White Rose work well for 
  this method of cooking. Yukon Gold type can be used, though the flavor 
  is different and they don't have those in India (or England, as far as 
  I know). For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; In England regular spinach 
  would be used, but &uuml;ber expert Julie Sahni says Swiss Chard is 
  much closer to what is called "spinach" in India. If using chard, 
  select the white version and cut out the thick stems, saving for 
  another use. Weight of greens only should be about 8 oz.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One Serrano will make this dish moderately 
  spicy, but I use two. Use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes for this dish come from England. 
  Some do not fry the potatoes at all, which makes the recipe quicker, 
  easier and lower in calories. Some use frozen spinach and others use 
  fresh spinach but cook it along with the potatoes for 20 minutes or so 
  (England is, after all, the land of overcooked vegetables). For that 
  method raw potato cubes are added to the fried onions along 
  with the spinach and it is cooked covered.</li>
