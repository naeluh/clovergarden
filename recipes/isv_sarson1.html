This famous pur&eacute;e of greens is very popular in the Punjab region 
of India (Northwest). It is made with countless variations of ingredients 
and methods - but the mustard greens are invariable.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
The "tempering" (tarka, tadka or whatever) varies greatly, and sometimes 
the greens are spiced a bit more and simply garnished with butter or 
crumbled paneer cheese. In all cases you want to end up with a 
pur&eacute;e that's thick but still pourable. Serve with corn bread, 
chapatis, roti, or similar.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 55 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>All Greens</b> to completely remove sand and mud. 
    Strip leaves and tender tips from <b>Methi</b>. Strip stems from 
    <b>Greens</b> and cut or tear into coarse pieces.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Chilis</b> and <b>Onions</b> medium. Mix.</li>
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or other suitable pan, place <b>Greens</b> and 
    <b>Chili Mix</b>. Mix <b>Cornstarch</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Water</b> 
    and pour in with the greens. Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer 
    slowly for about an hour until greens are very well cooked. Turn 
    occasionally and check water to make sure they don't dry out.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and chop small. Slice 
    <b>GARLIC</b> about 1/16th inch thick.</li>
  <li>When <b>Greens</b> have cooked, let them cool a bit and then run 
    them in a food processor (in batches as needed) until very smooth.
    </li>
  <li>Wash the pan and pour the <b>Greens</b> back in. Bring up slowly to 
    a simmer, watching that it doesn't splatter a lot. Adjust consistency 
    as needed, it should be just pourable, not too thin nor too thick,
    </li>
  <li>Tempering: &nbsp;Heat <b>Butter</b> in a small pan over moderate 
    heat and fry <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Garlic</b> until just lightly 
    browned.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Greens</b> into a fairly shallow serving dish. Pour 
    tempering over it and give just a few strokes of stirring to streak 
    it into the greens.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>"Spinach:"</h3> &nbsp; All recipes say "spinach", but 
  &uuml;ber-expert Julie Sahni says "spinach" in India is very different 
  from North American spinach. She suggests Swiss Chard (white stem 
  version) as the closest substitute, and that's what I use. She says 
  if you must use regular spinach include a small green bell pepper 
  (chopped) to improve the flavor. If you do use regular spinach cut 
  the weight down to about 10 ounces and use all but the largest stems.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Methi Greens:</h3> &nbsp; This is Fenugreek greens. Find them in 
  markets serving Mediterranean, Middle Eastern or Indian communities. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_fenugz.html">
  <b>Fenugreek</b></a> page. Note that some recipes use Goosefoot 
  (Lambs Quarters, Pigweed, <i>Chenopodium album</i>) instead of Methi 
  (or a whole lot of it in place of the spinach). You can't buy that in 
  North America, but it's such a common and aggressive weed here you 
  may have plenty of it in your garden </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Naturally these should be green Indian 
  "elephant trunk" chilis, but those are not always available even where 
  I shop, so use Serranos if you need to. Two seed-in serranos 
  makes this recipe noticeably hot - use your own best judgement. 
  Fof details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
