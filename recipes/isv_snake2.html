Delicious and satisfying as a side dish or as a light vegetarian main 
dish served with steamed Basmati rice. This recipe is from the Konkani 
cuisine, which spans the central western coast from Mumbai south to

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; &nbsp; (8-1/4 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li><b>IF</b> using <b>Dried Peas</b>, soak 1/2 cup 8 hours or 
    overnight with 1 t <b>Salt</b>. Drain and rinse.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b>  &nbsp; &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Split <b>GOURD</b> lengthwise and scrape out the spongy seed mass. 
    Cut into about 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch pieces, or as desired. In most 
    cases it is not necessary to peel the gourd.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>COCONUT</b> fine if fresh (or soak if dried grated - 
    see <a href="isv_snake2.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>) and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Core <b>CHILIS</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Grind the <b>Coconut</b> and <b>Chilis</b> to a paste 
    (see <a href="isv_snake2.html#06"><b>Note-7</b></a>), either together or separately 
    and then mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Sichuan Peppercorns</b> lightly in 1 T of water.</li>

  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saucepan, place <b>Gourd</b> and <b>Peas</b> along with 1-1/2 
    cups of water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the peas and gourd 
    are done - with frozen peas this will be about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut mix</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Kokum</b> and <b>
    Sichuan Pepper</b>. Add boiling water as needed for consistency - 
    not dry, not too watery. Bring back to a boil stirring, then simmer 
    for another 8 to 10 minutes stirring now and then.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Snake Gourd:</h3> &nbsp;  Found in markets serving an Indian 
  community, there are several sizes, shapes and colors of this gourd 
  ranging from 3 foot long and 1 inch diameter to 6 feet by 3 inches 
  or so.  A short gourd about 2-1/2 inches diameter works well in this 
  recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_snakez.html"><b>Snake Gourd</b></a> page. 
  You could also use Bottle Gourd (Opo) which is much easier to find, but 
  that one needs to be peeled. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black-eyed Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These can be either frozen or dried 
  soaked overnight (measure after soaking). I prefer frozen because they 
  stay nicely intact and finish up right with the gourd and the rice. 
  Black-eyed peas are from Africa, and made their way to India long 
  before they appeared in the American South.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh if possible. Measure is for fresh 
  or frozen coconut grated fine and measured without packing. I prefer 
  a "fresh" coconut which is like the dry ones but white instead of 
  brown. The flesh pops out of the shell easily and grates easier, and 
  the water is more flavorful for drinking. If fresh or frozen aren't 
  available use 2/3 cup of dried grated coconut (unsweetened) and soak 
  with enough water to make up 1 cup. Drain before using. For details on 
  handling coconuts, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconuts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 5 red chilis 
  but doesn't specify what kind, and her photo isn't very red which 
  would indicate small ones. I presume these would be Dhani, which are 
  pretty much the same as Thai red chilis, which are easily available 
  in North America. Five Thai chilis makes a  dish pretty hot by 
  Southern California standards - use your own best judgement. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kokum:</h3> &nbsp; A "piece" of kokum is generally 1/2 pod, 
  whether sliced crosswise or lengthwise. You could use 1/2 T Tamarind 
  concentrate as a substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cl_kokumz.html"><b>Kokum</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sichuan Pepper</h3> &nbsp; the pattern recipe calls for 5 
  <i>Teppal</i>. That Indian variety is much larger than the Chinese 
  variety so I doubled the quantity. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html"><b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; You can do the chilis and coconut while the 
  peas are cooking. The best tool to do the grinding is probably a 
  "Liquadora Azteca" (Aztec Blender), a flat stone surface with an oblong 
  stone slider (Sil and Batta in India) - but who has one of those in 
  North America? My mini-prep processor kind of chokes on this and needs 
  a lot of scraping down, but it's either that or chop on the cutting 
  board. When I get it as fine as I can I pound it in my big Thai granite 
  mortar - still not really paste. Anyway, do the best you can with 
  whatever you have.</li>
