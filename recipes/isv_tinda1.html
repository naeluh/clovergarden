<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tinda Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; These immature gourds are found in 
  markets serving an Indian or Pakistani community. As sold in Southern 
  California, they usually need no peeling or seeding. If you find they 
  have hard white or black seeds, these must be scraped out. The skins 
  are noticeable but usually not distracting. If you have older gourds, 
  or are uncertain, peel thinly with vegetable peeler. For details see 
  our   <a href="../ingred/gd_tindaz.html"><b>Tinda</b></a> page. You could 
  also make this recipe using Bottle Gourd (Opo) which is more easily 
  available in North America. It is much larger and needs peeling, but 
  cooking time is shorter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using the 2 Tablespoons of 
  tomato paste called for in the pattern recipes, I like to use a 
  convenient 8oz can of a very simple tomato sauce, which helps make up 
  for deficient tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other 
  simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; For Punjabi recipes, a mild Kashmir Chili 
  Powder is appropriate. 1/2 teaspoon of Kashmir is barely noticeable in 
  this recipe. Use your own best judgement here For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; This should be a northwestern Indian Garum 
  Masala, such  as our recipe <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam 
  Masala, Punjab</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; In Persia, Sabzi means herbs or other greens, 
  but in India Sabzi (or Subzi or Sabji) is a vegetable dish cooked with 
  a "gravy". This is not a heavily spiced dish, but if you want it 
  lighter, cut in half the whole Cumin Seeds at the start, and the 
  Garam Masala in the Finish Spices. I also like a little more "gravy" 
  than may be the practice in India, as I will likely eat it alone with 
  rice. The pattern recipe called for "Asafoetida" (hing), which is most 
  used by people forbidden onions, to fill the flavor gap, but I don't 
  consider it important here because there's plenty of onions. The large 
  amount (1/4 t) and late addition (with the Cooking Spices) indicates 
  she means "Hing Powder", which is cut with rice flour. Pure Hing would 
  be "a pinch" with the whole Cumin Seeds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
