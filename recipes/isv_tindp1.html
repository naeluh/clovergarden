<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tinda Gourd:</h3> &nbsp;  These immature gourds are found in 
  markets serving an Indian or Pakistani community. As sold in Southern 
  California, they usually need no peeling or seeding. If you find they 
  have hard white or black seeds, these must be scraped out. The skins 
  are noticeable but usually not distracting, but if you are uncertain,  
  peel thinly with vegetable peeler. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_tindaz.html"><b>Tinda</b></a> page. You could 
  also make this recipe using Bottle Gourd (Opo) which is much more 
  easily available in North America. It is a lot larger and needs 
  peeling, but cooking time is shorter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_opoz.html"><b>Bottle Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes of 
  this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Caution</u> - the measure is for 
  Kashmir chili powder, which is quite mild, and appropriate for Punjabi 
  recipes. Use your own best judgement here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chili</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is my addition. A convenient 8oz 
  can of a very simple tomato sauce, does wonders to make up for 
  deficient tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other 
  simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; This should be a northwestern Indian Garum 
  Masala, such  as our recipe <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam 
  Masala, Punjab</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; In Persia, Sabzi means herbs or other greens, 
  but in India Sabzi (or Subzi or Sabji) is a vegetable dish cooked with 
  a "gravy". For a drier version (without potatoes) see 
  <a href="isv_tinda1.html"><b>Tinda Gourd Sabzi</b></a>. The pattern 
  recipe called for "Asafoetida" (Hing), which is usually used by those 
  forbidden Onions to fill the flavor gap, We have enough onions in this 
  recipe, so I don't consider Hing to be important. If you wish to use 
  it, for pure Hing, add a pinch to the oil with the Cumin Seeds. For 
  the common Hing Powder, 1/4 teaspoon with the Cooking Spices. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html">
  <b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
