This recipe has a lot of steps, but it's really rather easy. Several 
operations can be done concurrently, and it can be done a day ahead, 
it reheats well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove seed mass from <b>ASH GOURD</b>. Cut into strips narrow enough 
    so you can peel them with your vegetable peeler. Cut into cubes about 
    3/4 inch on a side, or whatever size you prefer. Put in a pot with water 
    to cover, bring to a boil and simmer until done, about 15 minutes. The 
    pieces are done when they're translucent to the center. Drain, reserving 
    1 cup of the water.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>MOONG DAL</b> well and soak in water to cover for 1/2 hour, 
    Drain and put in a saucepan with <b>Turmeric</b> and 1 c <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil uncovered (to keep it from foaming over), then cover 
    and simmer on very low heat until done - 1/2 to 3/4 hour depending 
    on how you like your dal (in India they like it quite mushy).</li>
  <li>In a mortar, crush <b>URAD DAL</b> until a bit coarser than coarse 
    corn meal.</li>
  <li>In a small skillet, heat 1 t <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Urad Dal</b>, 
    <b>Cumin Seed</b>, <b>Chilis</b> and <b>Curry Leaves</b>. Fry stirring 
    over very moderate flame until the Urad becomes a light golden color. 
    Turn off heat and stir in <b>Coconut</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Pour out on 
    a plate to cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Pound cooled <b>Paste mix</b> in a mortar until it is a paste, then 
    mix it with the cooked <b>Moong</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a saut&eacute; pan and sir in <b>Mustard Seeds</b>.
    Fry stirring until seeds are popping well.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ash Gourd</b> and about 1/2 cup of the reserved 
    <b>Cooking Water</b>. Bring it up to a boil, then stir in 
    <b>Moong mix</b>. Adjust liquid so it's the consistency you want (I 
    make it fairly loose to go with rice) and bring back up hot.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ash Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; Sold as "Winter Melon",  
  these large gourds can be found in most Asian markets in North America. 
  they are so large they are usually cut into wedges and bagged in 
  plastic so you can buy by the piece.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html"><b>Ash Gourd</b></a> page </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Moong Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is the common green mung bean split 
  and peeled. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_mungz.html"><b>Mung Bean</b></a> page..</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; Urad is just like Mung Beans except black 
  instead of green. The dal is ivory white rather than yellow. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3>> &nbsp; If you like hot, use dried red de Arbols or 
  Thai chilis. For less heat use the common Japones. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are necessary 
  for the true flavor of southern India. They are now grown in California 
  and available fresh in many markets serving Indian communities. They 
  aren't effective dried. If you don't have them, leave them out - there 
  is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html">Curry Leaf</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; For this recipe we presume this is dried 
  grated coconut, but just a little more of fresh grated could be used.
