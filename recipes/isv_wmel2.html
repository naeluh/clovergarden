An excellent contrasting side dish served with rice and a main dish. It 
is a little sharp and a little simple to be a vegetarian main dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove seed mass from <b>ASH GOURD</b> and peel. You may have to 
    cut it into strips narrow enough for your vegetable peeler. Cut into 
    cubes about 3/4 inch on a side, or whatever size you prefer. </li>
  <li>Make Paste: &nbsp; Start by grinding <b>COCONUT</b> fine, then the 
    <b>CHILI</b>. Grind the <b>Cumin Seeds</b> to powder in your spice 
    grinder and stir into the Coconut along with <b>Rice Flour</b>. 
    Stir in <b>Yogurt</b> until well blended.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Put <b>Ash Gourd</b> in a sauce pan with <b>Turmeric</b>, 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and 
    simmer until done (15 to 20 minutes) tumbling now and then. The 
    pieces are done when they're translucent to the center. Drain, 
    <u>reserving the water</u>.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Ash Gourd</b> to the sauce pan and mix in the 
    <b>Paste</b> and enough of the reserved <b>Water</b> to make it 
    easy to stir (it will thicken some). Bring to a simmer for about 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>In a tiny skillet, heat <b>OIL</b> and <b>Mustard Seeds</b>.
    Fry stirring until seeds are popping well. Stir in 
    <b>Curry Leaves</b> until they stop spluttering. Pour over the 
    Ash Gourd.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ash Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; Sold as "Winter Melon",  
  these large gourds can be found in most Asian markets in North America. 
  they are so large they are usually cut into wedges and bagged in 
  plastic so you can buy by the piece.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html"><b>Ash Gourd</b></a> page </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; For this recipe we presume dry grated coconut, 
  which is easier and safer, but about 1/2 cup of fresh grated could be 
  used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Serranos are closest to Indian green chilis. 
  The Serranos grown here are quite large now, and just one makes this 
  dish quite sharp by Southern California standards - folks from the 
  Frozen North may prefer 1/2 Serrano. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Coconut oil is appropriate for this region, 
  but Avocado or Pure Olive (not virgin) can be used.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
