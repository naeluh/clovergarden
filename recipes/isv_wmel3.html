This is not only an excellent side dish, but sufficiently robust to be 
a vegetarian main dish for two. Served it with steamed rice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Put <b>Ash Gourd</b> in a sauce pan with 1 cup <b>Water</b>. Bring 
    to a boil, cover tightly and simmer until done (15 to 20 minutes), 
    tumbling now and then. The pieces are done when they're translucent 
    to the center. They'll still be a little firm on the rind edge. 
    Drain.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>TAMARIND</b> in 1/2 cup near boiling water for at least 
    30 minutes. Press through a fine strainer, keeping the liquid and 
    discarding the solids. Be sure to recover the paste clinging to the 
    outside of the strainer.</li>
  <li>Measure out <b>CHICKPEAS</b>. If not using canned, see 
    <a href="isv_wmel3.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>TOOR DAL</b> (reduces foaming) and cook with 1/16th 
    teaspoon <b>Turmeric</b> in water to cover well. In southern India 
    they cook to a soup like consistency (often in a pressure cooker), 
    but I like more texture, so 45 minutes to an hour is fine by me.</li>
  <li>Make Spicing: &nbsp; Separately dry roast each ingredient down to 
    but <u>not including</u> Rice Flour, until aromatic and darkening 
    just a shade. <b>Chili</b> should be lightly browned, not black. 
    Cool all <b>Roasted items</b> well, then grind to paste. Mix with 
    <b>Rice Flour</b>, <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> for Garnish.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Bring some <b>Water</b> to a boil. You will need it for precisely 
    controlling the consistency of the sauce.</li>
  <li>In a sauce pan sufficient for the recipe, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    <b>Mustard Seeds</b> until seeds are popping well, then stir in 
    <b>Curry Leaves</b> and <b>Asafoetida</b> just until the Curry 
    Leaves stop spluttering.</li> 
  <li>Stir cooked <b>Ash Gourd</b> into the pan along with 
    <b>Tamarind Juice</b>. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly and simmer 
    for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spicing mix</b>, <b>Toor Dal</b> and <b>Chickpeas</b>.
    If it's too dry (probably), stir in some boiling water until you 
    get the right consistency. Simmer covered another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ash Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; Sold as "Winter Melon", these large gourds 
  can be found in most Asian markets in North America. they are so large 
  they are usually cut into wedges and bagged in plastic so you can buy 
  by the piece.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html">
  <b>Ash Gourd</b></a> page </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; The amount is for block 
  form, which is more flavorful than concentrate. For details see our   
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chickpeas:</h3> &nbsp; The measure is for fully 
  cooked beans, from a can is just fine. The pattern recipe calls for a 
  "handful" of dried brown chana (Kala Chana), but allows Kabuli Chana 
  (Garbanzos). The Kala Chana would have to be soaked overnight and then 
  cooked, probably why the ingredient was flagged "optional". I find 
  Kabuli Chana from a can works well enough and don't consider this 
  ingredient optional, especially if using the recipe as a main dish.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tur Dal] This is split 
  and peeled Pigeon Peas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. Avoid the version 
  preserved with oil.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Bengal Gram] This is split and peeled Kala 
  Chana (see Chickpeas, above). It is available in any market serving an 
  Indian community, as it is a major item in the region.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; I use de Arbols, which make 
  this recipe suitably hot for southern India, and quite acceptable by 
  Southern California standards. If in doubt, use just one the first 
  time you make it. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Coconut:</h3> &nbsp; For this recipe we presume dry grated 
  coconut.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Coconut oil is appropriate for  
  this region, but Avocado or Pure Olive (not virgin) can be used.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; In India, black mustard seeds are always 
  used (except brown in Bengal), but the yellow ones will work if you 
  don't have black.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much 
  use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them out - there is 
  no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, because 
  some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
