The most common use for this salty, sour powder is as a garnish for 
fruit, salads, vegetables, fruit drinks (particularly freshly squeezed 
sweet lime) and snacks of all kinds. It is absolutely essential for many 
street vendors, who mix their own,

for most applications is from a salt shaker.

  <li>On a dry tava, comal or skillet, over fairly high heat, separately 
    dry toast each of the <b>Toasted items</b>, stirring often and being 
    careful not to burn them. Each is done when it's unique aroma becomes 
    more intense and it just starts to darken a shade. Since this happens 
    at different points for each, it's important they be toasted 
    separately. I always start with Cumin seeds because they make it easy 
    to tell when the pan is at the right temperature. Cool them all well.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Salt:</h3> &nbsp; This sulfurous salt is essential to the 
  correct taste and aroma of Chaat Masala. It can be had from specialty 
  markets serving an Indian community. It should be purchased in chunks 
  to assure it is real.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes include hot chili, but the amount 
  varies radically. I use Indian Reshampatti, which is medium hot and has 
  good flavor. The amount given here is "minimal" and should offend 
  no-one. I usually use twice that - others use more. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html">Indian Chilis</a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Amchur Powder:</h3> &nbsp; [Amchoor, Aamchur] &nbsp; This is dried 
  unripe mango, a standard souring agent in much of 	India, with a 
  citrus-like taste. It is sold both as dried slices and as powder. It 
  can be had from specialty markets serving an Indian community.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Asafoetida:</h3> &nbsp; [Hing] &nbsp; The quantity given here is 
  for pure ground hing. The common "hing powder" is cut with rice flour 
  to about 1/3 strength, so adjust if that's what you have.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; There is also a "Fruit Chaat Masala" which 
  is lighter on cumin, coriander and ginger, but higher in black salt, 
  asafoetida, amchur and chili. The simplest recipe is just Black Salt, 
  Amchur powder and Asafoetida - these ingredients are not optional in 
  any recipe.</li>
