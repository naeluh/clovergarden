A common spice powder in India, this toasted powder has a much different 
taste than just Ground Cumin or whole Cumin Seeds. In India, it is 
usually made in far larger quantity than the 3 Tablespoons shown here.

    details</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Spread <b>Cumin Seeds</b> in an unoiled iron pan or comal. Shown 
    in the Photo Gallery is the Lodge L9OG3 Round Griddle, which is ideal 
    for this sort of work.</li> 
  <li>Heat the pan to around 375&deg;F/190&deg;C, stirring the 
    <b>Cumin Seeds</b> almost constantly. The pan should never exceed 
    about 375&deg;F, and you should <u>never</u> see any trace of smoke. 
    The seeds are done when they are quite aromatic and have darkened 
    just a bit. They should never be darker than in the photos or they 
    will be bitter and lack flavor.</li>
  <li>Pour the <b>Cumin</b> into a dish and let cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> in your spice grinder or by other means. In 
    India, this was traditionally done warm, crushing with a hard 
    roller against a hard flat surface, in which case the result would 
    be much more coarse than in our photo.</li>
  <li>Sealed in a jar and kept in a cool place away from sunlight, this 
    powder should be good for a few weeks.</li>
