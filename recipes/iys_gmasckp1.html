  <b><u>Make:</u></b>	&nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>In a dry skillet, tava or rimmed comal, separately roast each of: 
    <b>Toasted items</b>, turning almost continuously with a thin 
    stainless turner. They are done when distinctly aromatic and 
    darkening just a shade. Since this happens at different points for 
    each it's important they be roasted separately. Pour them out on a 
    plate and cool well.</li>
  <li>When cool, mix the roasted seeds with all the other ingredients 
    and grind them very fine in a spice grinder. (a whirling blade coffee 
    grinder works very well). Make sure to grind well enough that all the 
    coriander husks are pulverized.</li>
  <li>package in an airtight jar. This recipe will 3/4 fill a 4 oz 
    spice jar.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Black Cumin Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; [Kala Jeera, Shahi Jeera, NOT Nigella, 
  called Black Cumin in Bengal] &nbsp; For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_cuminz.html"><b>Cumin / Black Cumin</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Poppy Seed:</h3> &nbsp; In India, white poppy seed is generally 
  used, but black will also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; This is much different in appearance 
  and flavor. The pods are much larger and very dark in color. Measure 
  is seeds only. For details, see our <a href="../ingred/gg_cardomz.html">
  <b>Cardamom</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Nag Kesar</h3> &nbsp; This is a spice used in Maharashtra, 
  and hard to find anywhere else. It is not a strong spice, and 
  most would not notice its absence if you don't have it. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/spices.html#nag"><b>Spices</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sichuan Peppercorns</h3> &nbsp; Fruits of a prickly ash tree, 
  - nothing at all like black peppercorns. The Indian version (Tirfal) 
  is larger but not as strong.  Asian recipes always call 
  for them to be lightly toasted before use, but to be legally imported 
  into the USA they must already be lightly toasted, so I skip that 
  step. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_sichuanz.html">
  <b>Sichuan Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if at all 
  possible. American "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which is thick 
  and hard. Real cinnamon can be found in markets selling Mexican herbs 
  and spices - the bark is very thin. Real cinnamon originated in Ceylon 
  (Sri Lanka), just south of Tamil Nadu, cassia came from Southeast Asia.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / 
  Cassia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>CKP:</h3> &nbsp; The Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu are a high order 
  Hindu caste in Maharashtra, on the central west coast of India. They 
  are roughly equivalent to the Brahmin castes and are authorized to 
  perform Vedic rituals. They are non-vegetarian and, in general, 
  considered "foodies".</li>
