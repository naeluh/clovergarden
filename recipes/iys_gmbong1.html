The Garam Masala of Bengal is much simpler than those of the Punjab and 
the rest of northern India. Traditionally, Bengalis leave the ingredients 
out in the hot sun for a day before grinding, but many younger Bengalis 
lightly dry toast them as is done in other parts of India.

Bengalis may also add other ingredients, particularly dried red chilis, 
and perhaps mace.  Note that the relative proportions of the ingredients 
are quite variable from household to household. Makes about 5 Tablespoons.

  <li>In a dry skillet, tava or rimmed comal, roast the 
    <b>Cardamom pods</b>, turning almost continuously with a thin 
    stainless turner and shaking the pan. They are done when they 
    darken just a shade. Do the same with the <b>Cloves</b> but 
    just until distinctly aromatic. Cool well before grinding.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>all items</b> very fine in a spice grinder. (a whirling 
    blade coffee grinder works very well) and mix together.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar. Stored away from sunlight and heat 
    it will will be usable for several months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cinnamon:</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if at all possible (for 
  all Indian recipes). American "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which 
  is thick, hard and sweeter. Real cinnamon can be found in markets 
  selling Mexican herbs and spices - the bark is very thin. Real 
  cinnamon originated in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), cassia in Southeast Asia. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon &amp; Cassia Bark</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Cardamom Pods, Green:</b> &nbsp; Some cooks shell out the seeds 
  and discard the pods. If using just seeds, freshly shell them out of 
  pods, they degrade rather rapidly after shelling, so commercial seeds 
  may be a bit stale.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bay Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; Note that many recipes for Bengali Garam 
  Masala skip the Bay Leaves. If used, these should actually be Tej Patta, 
  the bay leaf of India, but that is very hard to find in North America. 
  They are larger and have a stronger flavor than Mediterranean bay 
  leaves, and a hint of cassia - but there's already plenty of cinnamon 
  in this recipe. Our bay leaves make a suitable substitute. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/laurel.html#bay">Laurels</a> page.</li>
