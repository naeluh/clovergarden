  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hour - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>In a small skillet, heat 1 t <b>Oil</b> over moderate heat 
    (375&deg;F/190&deg;C). Stir in <b>Chana Dal</b> and fry stirring 
    until light golden. Remove and set aside to cool. &nbsp; <b>Note:</b> 
    with each step there will be less oil, but do not add any more.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Urad Dal</b> and fry stirring until light golden. 
    Remove and add to Chana Dal. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sesame Seeds</b> and fry stirring until light golden. 
    Remove and add to Chana Dal.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Red Chilis</b> and fry stirring until well browned in 
    spots, but not blackened. Remove and add to Chana Dal.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Curry Leaves</b> (if used). They will pop and 
    splutter for a few seconds, then take off the heat and stir in 
    <b>Salt</b>, then <b>Asafoetida</b> for just a few seconds. Add 
    all to the Chana Dal. If not using Curry Leaves, do this right after 
    the Chilis.</li>  
   <li>Spread out on a plate for rapid cooling. When well cooled, grind 
   <b>All Items</b> to a powder (see <a href="iys_idlipd1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).
   </li>
  <li>Package in a small airtight jar, and keep away from heat and 
    sunlight. It should be good for up to three months.</li>
  <li>See <a href="iys_idlipd1.html#07"><b>Uses</b></a> for links to recipes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Split Bengal Gram] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Bengal Chickpeas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas Bengal / Desi 
  Type</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Urad Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Black Gram Dal, White Lentils] &nbsp; This 
  is peeled and split Urad beans. It is used in a great many Indian 
  recipes so is widely available in Indian markets, or on-line. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_uradz.html"><b>Urad Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chilis, dry:</h3> &nbsp; As usual, the pattern recipe didn't 
  say what kind of Chilis. The photo example was made with Japones Chilis  
  for moderate heat. 1 ounce was 48 chilis. Use Thai Chilis for hotter. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html">
  <b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; This is the resin of a giant fennel 
  plant, used in India by sects forbidden to eat onions or garlic. &nbsp; 
  <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or 
  ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". The "powder" is heavily cut 
  with rice flour. The amount given here is for pure asafoetida. Use 
  about 3 times as much if what you have is the "powder" form, and stir 
  into temperings at the last moment. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06"><h3>Spice Grinder:</h3> &nbsp; The ideal is the small jar 
  on an Indian Mixie, but a small whirling blade coffee grinder can do 
  the job in batches.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Uses:</h3> &nbsp; The most important use for this Podi is for 
  smearing on fresh Idli Cakes. See our recipe 
  <a href="ibg_podidl1.html"><b>Podi Idli</b></a>. It is also used 
  similarly for smearing on <b>Dosa</b> - very thin, lacy pancakes 
  made from a fermented batter very like that used to make idlis.</li>
