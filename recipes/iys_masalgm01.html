This Garam Masala is typical of those used in the northwest of India, 
where it is applied to a great many dishes. It may be added to a dish 
during cooking but is more often added at the end of cooking or sprinkled 
over the finished dish before serving. It is a base set and the recipe 
may duplicate some of the ingredients to emphasize them. 
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Exact formulas 
for Garam Masala vary by region and even by household. This formula is 
highly aromatic, rich in flavor and relatively mild (no hot chilis). 
This recipe doesn't quite fill a 6 ounce spice jar.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>In a dry skillet, tava or rimmed comal, separately roast each of 
    the  <b>Dry Roast</b> items, turning almost continuously with a thin 
    stainless turner and shaking the pan. They are done when distinctly 
    aromatic and darkening just a shade. Since this happens at different 
    points for each it's important they be roasted separately. Start 
    with Cumin, as it is easier to tell when the pan is hot enough. If 
    you see even a faint whisp of smoke, your pan is too hot. Pour them 
    out on a plate and cool well before grinding.</li>
  <li>When cool, mix the <b>Dry Roast</b> items with all the other 
    ingredients and grind them very fine in a spice grinder. (a whirling 
    blade coffee grinder works very well - grind in batches so as not to 
    overload it). Make sure to grind well enough that all the coriander 
    and cardamom husks are pulverized well. Do not breath the dust, or 
    you will suffer.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar. Stored away from sunlight and heat it 
    will will be usable for up to a year.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mace:</h3> &nbsp; A "blade" is a whole wrapper from around a 
  Nutmeg. If you don't have Mace, use twice as much Nutmeg.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if at all possible. 
  American "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which is thick and hard. 
  Real cinnamon can be found among Mexican spices - the bark 
  is very thin. Real cinnamon originated in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).</li>
