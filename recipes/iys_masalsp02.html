Sambar Podi (Sambar Powder) is the basic seasoning for sambars, one 
of the signature dishes of Southern India. See also our

Sambars are dal based first course dishes that appear at most meals in 
the vegetarian cuisines of Southern India, but you don't have to be 
a vegetarian to enjoy them.

  <b><u>Make</u></b>	&nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>On a dry tava, comal or skillet, over moderate heat, separately dry 
    toast each of the <b>Toasted items</b>, stirring often and being 
    careful not to burn them. Each is done when it's unique aroma becomes 
    more intense and it just starts to darken. Since this happens at 
    different points for each, it's important they be toasted separately 
    (see <a href="iys_masalsp02.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Have everything measured in 
    advance because toasting time is very short. I always start with 
    Cumin seeds because they make it easy to tell when the pan is at the 
    right temperature. Chilis should be last because they can affect the 
    sense of smell. They should just darken a bit but not become black.
    </li>
  <li>Cool the pan and dry the <b>CURRY LEAVES</b> until brittle. This 
    should be on <u>very</u> low heat, turning frequently.</li>
  <li>Mix all ingredients together and grind them in a spice grinder until 
    very fine.</li>
  <li>package in an airtight jar - it'll keep 6 months or so.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split 
  Indian Chick Peas, which are smaller than the familiar Garbanzo. 
  <u>Any</u> market serving an Indian community will have chana dal. In 
  some recipes a mix of several different dals is used.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Hotness depends on how hot 
  your dried chilis are, and how many of them you use. The not so hot 
  Japones in this quantity will yield a fairly mild masala. Dried Arbols 
  or Thai chilis will deliver more impact, and if you like you can 
  increase the quantity. In Southern India they like their masala pretty 
  hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis Page</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are the signature 
  flavor of Southern India, but if you don't have them, you'll have to 
  leave them out - unfortunately there is no acceptable substitute.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; In India, where this is done 
  every few days (or used to be - now many buy ready made from their 
  local spice vendor), the toasting would be done in one pass. 
  Ingredients would be added in a particular order so they all come out 
  right. I don't have that much practice, so I do them all separately.
