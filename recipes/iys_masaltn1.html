Garam Masala is not so much used in South India, and what is used differs 
substantially from the more familiar Garam Masala of the north and 
northwest. 
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Of course exact formulas vary by household, but what is given here is 
fairly typical. Tamil Nadu also has another Garam Masala with a lot of 
fresh curry leaves and some chilis.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b>	&nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>In a dry skillet, tava or rimmed comal, separately roast each of: 
    <b>SEEDS</b> (top down to the line), turning almost continuously with 
    a thin stainless turner. They are done when distinctly aromatic and 
    darkening just a shade. Since this happens at different points for 
    each it's important they be roasted separately. Pour them out on a 
    plate and cool well.</li>
  <li>When cool, mix the roasted seeds with all the other ingredients and 
    grind them very fine in a spice grinder. (a whirling blade coffee grinder 
    works very well). Make sure to grind well enough that all the coriander 
    husks are pulverized.</li>
  <li>package in an airtight jar. This recipe will completely fill a 4 oz 
    spice jar.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Cardamom Pods, Green:</h3> &nbsp; You can roast these and grind 
  them up in the pods. Some cooks shell out the seeds and discard the 
  pods. If using just seeds, freshly shell them out of pods, they degrade 
  rather rapidly after shelling, so commercial seeds may be a bit stale.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cinnamon</h3> &nbsp; Use real cinnamon if at all 
  possible. American "cinnamon" is actually cassia bark which is thick 
  and hard. Real cinnamon can be found in markets selling Mexican herbs 
  and spices - the bark is very thin. Real cinnamon originated in Ceylon 
  (Sri Lanka), just south of Tamil Nadu, cassia came from Southeast Asia.
