This powder is used to flavor sour peppery soups called Rasams, which are 
very popular in southern India. They are usually vegetarian, but in 
Chattinad some are made with chicken.

  <ol>
  <li>On a dry tava, comal or skillet, fairly high heat (about 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C), separately dry roast each of the <b>Dry Roast 
    items</b>, stirring almost continuously with a thin stainless 
    turner until aromatic and darkened just a shade. The Chilis should 
    be darkened but not blackened. If you see a wisp of smoke, remove from 
    the heat immediately - there should be no smoke. Pour out on a plate 
    to cool.</li>
  <li>Over very low heat, dry the <b>Curry Leaves</b>, turning them 
    often, until they are brittle - they must not burn, just dry 
    thoroughly. Alternately they can be dried in a dehydrator overnight, 
    but they must be freshly dried, not stored dried.</li>
  <li>When well cooled, mix all ingredients together and grind them in 
    an Indian <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or a spice 
    grinder until very fine.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar - it'll keep up to 6 months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The standard Japones will do fine here. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Toover Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Toor, Tur, Tuvar, Red Gram, Arhar] &nbsp; 
  This is peeled and split Pigeon Peas, easily available from any market 
  serving an Indian community. Use the dry, not the oiled. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html"><b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chana Dal:</h3> &nbsp; This is peeled and split desi type chickpeas, 
  easily available from any market serving an Indian community. For details
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas (Bengal / Desi 
  type)</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the true 
  flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in Indian markets, 
  at least here in California. Dried ones aren't of much use. If you don't 
  have them you will have to leave them out - there is no acceptable 
  substitute. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html">
  <b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: 
  Pure Hing (asafoetida beads or ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". 
  The "powder" is heavily cut with rice flour. The amount given here is 
  for pure asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much if what you have is 
  the "powder" form. For details see our  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html">
  <b>Asafoetida</b></a> page. If you don't have it, leave it out.</li>
