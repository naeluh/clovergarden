"Rasam" indicates this powder is used to flavor sour tamarind soups 
called Rasams, but it has many other uses in Udupi cuisine, one of the 
strictest vegetarian cuisines.

  <ol>
  <li>On a dry tava, comal or skillet, fairly high heat (about 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C), separately dry roast each of the <b>Dry Roast 
    items</b>, stirring almost continuously with a thin stainless 
    turner until aromatic and darkened just a shade. If you see 
    a wisp of smoke, remove from the heat immediately - there should 
    be no smoke. Pour out on a plate to cool.</li>
  <li>With kitchen shears cut <b>Biadagi Chilis</b> into about 1/4 inch 
    pieces, discarding the seeds. Dry roast as for the spices above, 
    until chili pieces are darkened a bit, but not blackened and no 
    smoke.</li>
  <li>Over very low heat, dry the <b>Curry Leaves</b>, turning them 
    often, until they are brittle - they must not burn, just dry 
    thoroughly. Alternately they can be dried in a dehydrator overnight, 
    but they must be freshly dried, not stored dried.</li>
  <li>When well cooled, mix all ingredients together and grind them in 
    a spice grinder until very fine.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar - it'll keep up to 6 months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Byadagi Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This dried red chili 
  is the most common one used for "Kashmiri Chili Powder" (real Kashmiri 
  chilis are in very short supply even in India). If you can't find them, 
  your best bet is to dry toast 1/3 cup Kashmiri Chili Powder very 
  carefully, stirring constantly with a thin stainless turner, until it 
  darkens just a shade, then pour out to cool. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are 
  necessary for the true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably 
  available in Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones 
  aren't of much use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them 
  out - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Asafoetida - Hing:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call 
  for this, and some don't. I prefer to leave it out and apply it to 
  the Tempering. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> there are two forms: Pure 
  Hing (asafoetida beads or ground) and the more common "Hing Powder". 
  The "powder" is heavily cut with rice flour. The amount given here is 
  for pure asafoetida. Use about 3 times as much if what you have is 
  the "powder" form. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page. If you don't 
  have it, leave it out.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes for Udupi 
  rasam powder from Karnataka have the spices and chilis fried in a 
  small (or large) amount of coconut oil, but a few toast them dry, 
  as is normal for most of India. Many recipes mention that the flavor 
  fades rather rapidly, and some blame that directly on coconut. For 
  this reason, Since I live in North America, not Karnataka, and will 
  not be having rasam every day, I have chosen to dry toast the spices 
  and chilis, expecting the flavor will last longer as with other 
  masalas. The majority opinion of Karnataka recipes is that Udupi 
  rasam powder, unlike most others, does not contain black pepper. 
  a minority includes black pepper, but I have chosen to omit it.
