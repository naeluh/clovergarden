Sambars are usually the first course in a southern Indian meal. Every 
cook has their favorite Sambar Podi. This simple one is based 
on recipes from Tamil Nadu. See also our

  <li>On a dry tava, comal or skillet, fairly high heat, separately dry 
    roast each of the <b>Dry Roasted items</b>, stirring often and being 
    careful not to burn them - there should never be smoke. Each is done 
    when it's unique aroma becomes more intense and it darkens just a 
    shade. Since this happens at different times for each, it's important 
    they be roasted separately. Have everything measured in advance 
    because roasting time is very short. I always start with Cumin seeds 
    because they make it easy to tell when the pan is hot enough.</li>
  <li>Mix all ingredients together and grind them in a spice grinder until 
    very fine.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar - it'll keep 6 months or so.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Toor Dal:</h3> &nbsp; [Tur Dal] &nbsp; This is split 
  and peeled Pigeon Peas, available in any market serving an Indian 
  community, as it is a major item in the region. Do not buy the 
  version preserved with oil.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Hotness depends on how hot 
  your dried chilis are, and how many of them you use. I used de Arbols 
  which make a fairly spicy podi by Southern California standards. If 
  you want it a little less hot you can use the common Japones, but in 
  southern India they do like their powder fairly hot. Now I have 
  Ramnad Mundu chilis, which are very popular in Tamil Nadu, so I'll try 
  them for the next batch. For details see
