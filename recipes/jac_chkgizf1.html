A very nice appetizer and easy to make - but I have no idea if it has ever 
been made in Japan. The pattern recipe was from a Korean food expert who 
learned it from a New York sushi bar.

Here in California most Japanese sushi bars are now owned and operated 
by Koreans, not Japanese, but the originator of the recipe says it's 
definitely not Korean.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>GIZZARDS</b> and clean as needed. Cut apart the two lobes. 
    The pattern recipe suggests discarding the membrane that bridges between 
    the two lobes for greater tenderness.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>BATTER</b> It will be quite stiff, more like dough than a 
    batter.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Gizzards</b> into the batter until well and evenly coated.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or other suitable vessel, heat sufficient <b>Oil</b> 
    for deep frying to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. During frying try to keep 
    the oil between about 325&deg;F/160&deg;C to and 345&deg;F/175&deg;C 
    so the gizzards have time to cook through before becoming too browned.</li>
  <li>Scoop out some batter coated <b>Gizzards</b> with a large spoon. Use a 
    small spoon to push them off into the hot <b>Oil</b>. When they are 
    medium browned, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and drain briefly 
    on paper towels.</li>
  <li>These are best serve immediately while still fairly hot, because the 
     gizzards get tougher as they cool. I suppose you could reheat in a hot 
     oven, but I haven't tried that (no gizzards left).</li>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><b>Chicken Gizzards:</b> &nbsp; Look for these in 
  markets serving ethnic communities (just about any eth except North 
  Americans). As sold here in California they are peeled, cleaned and 
  ready to cook.  Some recipes call for "scraping off the hard green and 
  yellow stuff" which is completely unnecessary here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Starch:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe didn't say what kind of 
  starch. I used potato starch (of which I had plenty on hand), but 
  probably cornstarch or some other starch would do.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sweet Rice Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Available from almost any market 
  serving an Asian community, this flour is ground from so-called "sweet 
  rice", which is not actually sweet. It gets the name from being a 
  common ingredient in sweets.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dip:</h3> &nbsp; Any dip you like. I often use plain Sukang Iloco 
  (Philippine cane vinegar) and salt, but the source of the recipe 
  suggests 2 T roasted sesame seed pounded in a mortar, 5 T mayonnaise, 
  juice of 1 lemon, 2 t soy sauce and 1 t honey, or more to taste 
  (for 1 # gizzards).</li>
