Miso glazed sablefish is the signature dish of celebrity chef and 
restauranteur Nobu Matsuhisa -  also famous for refusing to remove 
endangered bluefin tuna from his menus. 
</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Lets face facts here. This is a chef's dish - and a Japanese dish to 
boot. That's two strikes. It's tiny, delicate and fussy - but it's also 
<u>totally</u> <u>delicious</u>. It's actually rather easy - but takes 
care and delicate handling. Unfortunately, unlike a celebrity chef, 
you don't have a kitchen full of Guatemalan illegals to do this for you.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 to 24 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>SABLEFISH</b> fillets into the size you'd like, compensating 
    for shrinkage (see <a href="jaf_sablnobu1.html#01">Note-1</a>).</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> thoroughly. Reserve a little of the 
    marinade for garnish on the plate if you want to do the fancy chef 
    thing (See <a href="jaf_sablnobu1.html#04">Note-4</a>).</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Fish</b>. Marinate in the 
    refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours, turning now and then.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min each)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Preheat the broiler.</li>
  <li> Shake excess marinade from the <b>Sablefish</b> 
    and set it (the fish) on a rack, skin side up (if skin-on), and slip 
    into the broiler. Roast until skin starts to bubble and get 
    crisp (if skin-on). You have about 45 seconds between done and 
    burned. If no skin, it should just be nicely browned. Flip over 
    (easier said than done) and broil until nicely browned on the 
    other side (See <a href="jaf_sablnobu1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Very carefully free the fish from the rack and hoist onto a warm 
    dish. Garnish as desired (see <a href="jaf_sablnobu1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>) and 
    serve immediately. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sablefish:</h3> &nbsp; Commonly sold as "Black Cod". This weight is 
  for fillets which may be skin-on or skinless as you desire. If you 
  start with a whole fish you'll need one about 2-1/2 pounds to get a 
  pound of fillet. Japanese markets (a disappearing breed) sometimes 
  have fillets, though I hear they may be cut a bit small, and of course 
  they will be very fine - and <u>very</u> expensive. Note that the tiny 
  serving in the photo started out at 3-1/2 ounces and was larger, but 
  thinner. For more detail see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_sablez.html"><b>Sablefish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shiro Miso:</h3> &nbsp; Shiro (white) miso is not actually white, 
  but a light beige. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soymz.html"><b>Miso Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Different writers give different methods. 
  Common is to use an indoor grill for the browning, then slip into a 
  400&deg;F/200&deg;C oven to finish. Others broil or use a grill pan, 
  and at least one pan fries, but almost all finish in the oven. Perhaps 
  my broiler isn't as hot as whatever they're using, but by time I've 
  got the fish browned on both sides it's done through and threatening 
  to disintegrate into flakes if I look at it hard. Do whatever works 
  for you - but you'd better do a test run (or two) before an important 
  presentation.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; Fancy chefs serve this on a plain white dish 
  much too large for it, decorate the dish with an arc of drops of 
  reserved marinade in order of descending size, and something 
  green - or some other chefly artistry. It is then presented at the table 
  to be swooned over. Some pickled ginger (the pink stuff) is a lot 
  easier, and actually goes really well with the fish - but I suppose you 
  can't get a worshipful write-up in the gourmet press with something 
  simple and practical.</li>
