This is a very popular dish in Japan, particularly in the summer. They 
are traditionally served in a small basket (<i>Zaru</i>). These 
noodles are very different from Pasta, so are handled differently.

<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b>
<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min +15 min sauce, make ahead)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>Condiments</b> as desired. Scallions are pretty much 
    mandatory, then one or two others.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a boil. The Japanese don't usually 
    salt the water because the dip will be salty.</li>
  <li>Hold the bundle of <b>Soba</b> vertically over the pot and have 
    the noodles drop into the pot a few at a time to assure they don't 
    stick together. Stir well for a minute or so, bringing back to a 
    boil, then turn down to a slow simmer and cover.</li>
  <li>Simmer <b>Soba</b> until cooked evenly all the way through (not 
    <i>al-dente</i>). The noodles should be softened, but still strong 
    enough to wash, and not at all mushy.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Soba</b>. Return to the pot and fill with Cold Water. 
    Tumble them around with your hands to wash them well. Change the 
    water and wash some more. Drain well.</li>
  <li>Serve with <b>Dip</b> and <b>Condiments</b> (<i>yakumi</i>) on the 
    side (see  <a href="jag_zarsob1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> and <a href="jag_zarsob1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>).  These noodles are often accompanied with 
    chilled Tofu dice or Tempura, both of which can use the same dip.</li>
  </ol> 

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Soba Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These are noodles made 
  with buckwheat flour. Many "health conscious" recipes presume they are 
  "gluten free", but they almost always contain some wheat flour so there 
  is enough gluten to hold them together. Pure buckwheat Soba is made, 
  but rare, and probably more difficult to handle. In Japan, a common mix 
  is 3-7, 30% wheat, 70% buckwheat - but you'll not find that in the 
  Asian markets around here - I've seen as little as 3% buckwheat, but 
  most don't say, just listing buckwheat as the second ingredient. A well 
  known Japanese Soba enthusiast here in Los Angeles makes hers about 20% 
  wheat, 80% buckwheat. Note that some brands include "Yam" (konnyaku 
  powder) which makes the noodles sturdier and easier to handle.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mentsuyu:</h3> &nbsp; This is the standard Japanese noodle dip / 
  broth, very easy to make, and will last for a couple weeks in the 
  fridge. It is finished in various concentrations. For dip, I like 
  1/2 Dashi, 1/2 Kaeshi. See our  <a href="jjf_ments1.html">
  <b>Kaeshi &amp; Mentsuyu</b></a> recipe.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eating:</h3> &nbsp; You eat these noodles by picking up a small 
  bunch with chopsticks, dip briefly into the sauce (some recipes saying 
  2/3 of the way). I have seen photos on the Internet of a cylinder of 
  noodles wrapped neatly and tightly around a 
  pair of chopsticks. This is essentially impossible to do at the table 
  and had to be carefully constructed for the photo. What I do is pick up 
  some noodles with chopsticks, lower them into the dip, then let go. I 
  immediately pick them up again, across the dip bowl. This brings them up 
  in a less stringy bunch, and brings more condiment with the noodles. 
  Whatever method, don't leave the noodles in the sauce for more than a 
  couple seconds. </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Condiments:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes have you add condiments to 
  the dip, though some hold nori aside and sprinkle it over the noodles. 
  Don't overload the dip with condiments, add a bit more when needed. 
  In Japan, some people capture some of the water drained from the Soba 
  (<i>sobayu</i>). After the noodles are eaten, they add some to the 
  remaining dip and drink it as soup.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Shichimi Togarashi:</h3> &nbsp; OK, you want to know what 
  this is. It's a table condiment - red chili flake mixed with ground 
  yuzu peel, szechuan peppercorns, nori (seaweed), toasted white and 
  black sesame seeds and toasted poppy seeds - or some other stuff. 
  Often called "7 flavor pepper".</li>
