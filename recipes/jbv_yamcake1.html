Similar to potato pancakes (latkes) but tender and more delicate in flavor. 
Excellent for brunch, but figure about 2 pancakes per person as these are 
not low calorie.

<p>This recipe makes about 8 pancakes a little over 3 inches 
across. If you need drier more durable pancakes use 1 ounce and pat 
thinner like an Indian dosa.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>NAGAIMO</b> and grate on the fine shredder side of your 
    grater. You will now have a disgusting slimy glob of goop, but do not 
    fear, it will cook fine.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Shrimp</b> to powder in a mortar or your spice grinder. 
    Massage it into the <b>Nagaimo</b> along with <b>Salt</b> (or 
    have a kid do it, they love playing in slime).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Scallions</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Lard</b> up hot in a large skillet. Put 1-1/2 oz spoonfuls 
    of <b>Nagaimo</b> into the pan and fry over medium high heat until 
    golden brown on the bottom. Meanwhile cut pieces of <b>Sliced Bacon</b> 
    and press them gently onto the top side of the pancakes.</li>
  <li>When pancakes are nicely golden brown on the bottom and hold their 
    shape when moved around use a thin turner to flip them over bacon side 
    down. Continue frying until the bacon side is golden brown also.</li>
  <li>Turn pancakes out onto paper towels and pat the top with a towel to 
    absorb oil, but don't let them linger on the towel, they'll stick. 
    They can be set on a plate or platter bacon side up in a low oven until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Serve garnished with a sprinkle of chopped <b>Scallions</b></li>
  </ol>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Nagaimo:</h3> &nbsp; This long beige yam can be 
  found in markets serving an East Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ym_nagaimoz.html"><b>Nagaimo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; These are important 
  in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America 
  and aren't hard to find. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.
  </li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, lard. My attempt to fry 
  these in olive oil was a total disaster, they stuck fast to the pan 
  and couldn't be pried loose. The pan had to be scraped and washed. I 
  tried lard and they didn't even think about sticking. The American 
  Heart Association so villainized lard Americans are afraid to use it, 
  but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they told us to use 
  instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is now 
  increasingly used by top chefs. Further, the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been 
  <u>completely</u> discredited. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
