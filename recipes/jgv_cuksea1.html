This refreshing Sunomono is very popular in Japan. I have cut the amount 
of sugar called for in most authentic recipes by 1/3, as I like it less 
sweet than they do in Japan. See also <a href="jgv_cuksea1.html#04"><b>Comments:</b></a>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBERS</b> very thin, about 1/16 inch. This is best 
    done on a mandolin or similar slicer. Put them in a bowl 
    with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and tumble so they are evenly coated. Let 
    them sweat for at least 1/2 hour, tumbling a couple of times, 
    then rinse and drain well. Wring out excess water. </li>
  <li>Break up <b>WAKAME</b> into small pieces (they will get a lot 
    larger). Soak in cool water about 20 minutes, then drain well and 
    squeeze out excess moisture. The 1/2 ounce will have become about 
    4-3/4 ounces.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing items</b> together in a small jar.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cucumbers</b> and <b>Wakame</b>. this is best done by hand 
    so you can feel and pull apart any lumps, and tear any oversize 
    pieces of seaweed.</li>
  <li>Shake up the <b>Dressing</b> vigorously and mix into the salad.</li>
  <li>Serve chilled, garnished with <b>Sesame Seeds</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Use narrow unwaxed cucumbers that need 
  not be peeled or seeded (Persian, European, Japanese, Korean, etc.).
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Wakame:</h3> &nbsp; This is a popular seaweed found dried in just 
  about any Asian market. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_wakamz.html"><b>Wakame</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have toasted sesame seeds 
  on hand, it takes only a few minutes to dry pan roast white sesame 
  seeds to a light golden color. See our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a></li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp;  The Japanese usually combine seaweed with 
  a land vegetable, most popularly cucumber. The ratio of seaweed to 
  cucumber varies somewhat. I have seen recipes with twice the seaweed I 
  call for, as well as half my amount. American sushi bars serve a 
  seaweed only salad dressed with sesame oil. That salad is unknown in 
  Japan. Most sushi bars buy that salad in tubs from Costco, and sell it 
  at a "sushi bar appropriate" price. Neither the Japanese nor the 
  Koreans use sesame oil in their seaweed salads. For a salad similar 
  to, but healthier than, the Costco salad, see our 
  <a href="jgv_seasal1.html"><b>Seaweed Salad</b></a>.</li>
