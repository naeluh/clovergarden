Traditional Japanese Mirin (Hon Mirin) is very scarce and hard to find in 
North America. The "Mirin Type Seasonings" found in markets are faked up. 
This recipe is closer to authentic - see <a href="jig_mirinf1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; A lightly refined sugar (Turbanado) gave me a taste 
  and color closer to the authentic Japanese Mirin I had on hand than plain 
  white sugar did. The authentic mirin was a little sweeter than this recipe.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sake:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good quality drinkable Sake for this recipe. 
  For the photo example I used Gekkeikan brand Sake, brewed in Folsom, 
  California.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Traditional Hon Mirin is made by a process similar 
  to making Sake, but modified so a lot of sugars are produced. It ends up at 
  8% to 14% alcohol. Regular Sake is around 15.6%. What is easily available in 
  markets today is faked up "Mirin Type Seasoning", based on Glucose or Corn 
  Syrup (Fructose). They may or may not have a significant amount of alcohol, 
  and if they have any, may have 1.4% salt added to make them undrinkable, 
  avoiding liquor taxes. The version given by this recipe is more authentic 
  than most and will be about 11% alcohol. It is similar to TAKARA Mirin, 
  a high grade product made by TAKARA SAKE USA Inc. Berkeley, California, from 
  Takara brand Sake and sugars. Theirs is 12% alcohol - you could achieve that 
  with a dash of Vodka.
