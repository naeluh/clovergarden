<h3>Hanjuku Yudetomago</h3> means "Soft boiled eggs". Boiled harder is 
just Yudetomago. See <a href="jkd_eggaji1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a><p></p> 
<h3>Ajitama</h3> is short for <b>Ajitsuke Tamago</b>, "Seasoned Eggs".<p></p>

<p>Do these in small batches, 4 to 6 eggs so you have tight control. Always 
do more than you need as you may have one or more that don't peel well.</p>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Pierce <b>EGGS</b> on the big end - doesn't help for peeling, but does 
    help to prevent bursting.</li>
  <li><b>Important:</b> this step makes the eggs more peelable, breaking the 
    undershell membrane from the egg white.
    <br>In a sauce pan, bring plenty of water to a rolling boil. Set <b>Eggs</b> 
    in the water for 30 to 40 seconds over high heat. Pour out as much water 
    as you can, and chill eggs with a splash of cold water. Pour that out and 
    fill the pan with cold water to 1/2 inch over the eggs.</li>
  <li> Place pan on high heat. Bring up to a full boil (eggs will start to 
    rattle around and bubble rise) <u>immediately turn off the heat</u>.</li>
  <li>Time you eggs precisely. For Medium Eggs, about 2 minutes for yolks 
    quite liquid, 2-1/2 minutes for jelly with a little liquid in the center 
    and slight setting on the outer surface. By 3 minutes yolk will be 
    completely solid and flavor will have changed substantially. Large eggs 
    will take about 30 seconds longer.</li>
  <li>Immediately, stop the cooking by pouring out the hot water while 
    pouring in cold water. After a couple of changes of water, let them 
    cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Crack the shell against your cutting board and peel off the shell, very 
    gently and patiently, as the whites are still tender. Doing it under cold 
    running water may help.</li>
  <li>Place Eggs in a bowl of cold water so they float and stay round.</li>

  <li>In a container large enough so the eggs will float fairly loose, 
    place both <b>Sauce</b> and <b>Soft boiled Eggs</b>.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate <b>Sauced Eggs</b> for 8 to 10 hours. Much beyond 10 hours 
    they may begin to get rubbery.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Eggs</b>. Keep refrigerated, but let warm to room temperature 
    for Ramen.</li>
  <li>For Ramen, cut an <b>Egg</b> in half lengthwise (a wire cutter works 
    best - see <a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html#cutter"><b>Egg Tools</b></a>). 
    After placing other Toppings, float Egg half (one or two as per preference) 
    in the Soup, cut side up. Serve immediately.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer medium eggs, as they fit better in a 
  Ramen Soup bowl nicely. Note that Japanese Ramen enthusiasts prefer 
  their Ajitama to have very liquid yolks, even more liquid than the 
  Hanjuku Yudetomago in the photo, and certainly more than the Ajitama 
  in the other photo. Others may want a bit more solid, as is the Ajitama 
  photo, but the flavor does change along with the texture.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Egg Tools:</h3> &nbsp; For helpful tools, see our 
  <a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html"><b>Egg Tools</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Everyone's stove and pans are different, and 
  Hanjuku Yudetomago needs very precise timing. You're going to have to 
  run one or more test batches to make sure you get it right with your 
  facilities. A test batch should be 4 eggs, to be reasonable close to a 
  run of 6 eggs. More than 6 eggs at a time is not recommended.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; If <a href="jkm_pigcsh1.html"><b>Pork 
  Chashu</b></a> (another topping) has been made, there may be plenty of 
  seasoning left over that can be used for this recipe.</li>
