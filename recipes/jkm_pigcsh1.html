<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; Try to get Pork Belly that's about half meat 
  and half fat. Most recipes call for using a single slab, but for that I'd 
  have to go all the way to Vietnam/China (42 miles round trip). The 
  Philippines is closer, but they tend to be more costly. Around here its 
  sliced about 1 inch wide, which is fine by me. Recipes call for "skinless", 
  but here in Southern California it's always "skin on", which is the way it's 
  usually used here. I do shave off the skin for this recipe, but no way am 
  I going to waste that pig skin. It goes into the sauce to be cooked for 
  about 40 minutes, then eaten as a snack. YES, pork belly is fatty, but the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been found to be 
  fraudulent from the get go, and is now thought to be harmful - so go for 
  the flavor - it'll just cause you to eat less sugary stuff. If you're still 
  not convinced, you can use Pork Shoulder, but make sure it's pretty fatty 
  or you will be disappointed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mirin:</h3> &nbsp; This is properly a sweet cooking potion made by 
  a process similar to Sake, but different rice and much sweeter. Around 
  here the real thing is hard to find and expensive. Products like Kikkoman 
  "Aji Mirin" (Aji means "tastes like") are fine for recipes like this. For 
  closer to the real thing see our <a href="jig_mirinf1.html"><b> Mirin - 
  Non Traditional</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Star Anise</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe says "optional", but I 
  always have plenty and see no reason to omit it for additional 
  flavor. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_staraz.html"><b>Star 
  Anise</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sauce</h3> &nbsp; The Sauce left from this recipe is often used as 
  the soaking sauce for making <a href="jkd_eggaji1.html"><b>Ajitama 
  Eggs</b></a>.</li>
