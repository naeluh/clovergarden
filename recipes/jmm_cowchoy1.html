A simple, easy to make but flavorful stir fry in the manner of Japanese 
home cooking. Quite similar to Chinese, but varies some in ingredients 
used in the marinade and sauce.

  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into bite size medallions about 1/8 
    inch thick.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop fine. Chop <b>Scallions</b> fine.  Mix all <b>Marinade Items</b> 
    and massage into the <b>Beef</b>. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes 
    (or 3 times as long in the fridge).</li>
  <li>Tear or cut leaves from <b>BOK CHOY</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 
    inches on a side. Slice the stems about 1/2 inch wide and 
    keep separate.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat removed.  Cooking time is very short, so a reasonably tender 
  cut is appropriate. Shoulder is fine as long as it's clear meat with very 
  little membrane and no gristle.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This should be the dark Asian sesame oil 
  made from toasted seeds.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potato Starch:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 
  katakuriko, but the lily this starch is made from is very slow growing,  
  has been badly over-harvested, and starch from it's root is very 
  expensive. The name has come to mean "potato starch".</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I have given 1/2 the amount of sugar 
  called for in the pattern recipe - but I actually leave it out entirely.  
  Sugar is evil. On the other hand, the recipe tastes more Japanese with 
  sugar - the Japanese are very big on sugar sweetened sauces.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3>  &nbsp; I made this recipe with the 
  very small white stemmed bok choy easily available here in Los Angeles. 
  The pattern recipe used the green stemmed Shanghai bok choy (sold as 
  "baby bok choy" in the markets). That would be a better choice if very 
  small white stemmed bok choy is not available in your markets. With 
  Shanghai bok choy it isn't so important to keep the stems and leaves 
  separate. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mushrooms</h3> &nbsp; Regular white mushrooms are OK for this dish, 
  but I prefer the small King Trumpet Oyster mushrooms now grown in 
  volume here in California. They are typically 5 inches tall 
  and about 1-1/4 inches in diameter, have very good texture, better 
  flavor  and can be kept in the refrigerator for weeks in their plastic 
  bag. For details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html">
