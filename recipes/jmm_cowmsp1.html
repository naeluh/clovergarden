This recipe, clearly in the Chinese style, has been adapted for Japan.
Malabar Spinach is not well known in most of North America, but is popular 
from India to Japan and the Philippines.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>MALABAR SPINACH</b> well. Remove leaves and tender tips 
    from stems. Tear large leaves into smaller pieces. Keep stems 
    separate. Use all stems that snap off cleanly, and some a bit 
    larger if you need too. Snap stems into lengths of 1 inch at the 
    thick end to 1-1/2 inch or more at the tender end.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 
    strips about 1/2 inch wide by 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> into strips of similar size to the Beef.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Make a slurry of <b>Potato Starch</b> and <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Sesame Oil</b> over moderate heat and fry 
    <b>Garlic</b>, stirring until just aromatic. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and 
    fry stirring until all raw color is gone and most exuded liquid has 
    evaporated. Keep the heat moderate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach Stems</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b> fry stirring for 
    about 4 minutes more, still over moderate heat.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach Leaves</b> over high heat. Tumble until coated 
    with oil, then stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>.  Bring up to a boil quickly 
    and tumble until the leaves wilt - don't overcook or it will become 
    slimy.</li>
  <li>Push the ingredients up the sides of the wok. Stir up the <b>Starch 
    Slurry</b> and pour it into the center. Stir until it starts to 
    thicken, then stir the ingredients together until well coated.</li>
 <li>Serve hot with rice (Japanese rice is medium grain).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Mong Toi, Saan Choy] 
  This green is widely available in Asian markets. 1 Pound as sold should 
  yield 12 to 13 ounces usable. Be careful not to overcook it - it can 
  become slimy. If you need to use some stems that don't snap cleanly, 
  cut them diagonally into short lengths. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe, being 
  Japanese, calls for Maitakes, which may not be common where you live, 
  and which are still expensive in Southern California. I use the 
  excellent small King Trumpets now grown in California, but other Oyster 
  mushrooms can be used. If using fresh Shiitakes, give them a 20 minute 
  soak in warm water as if they were dried, then wring them out and slice 
  them. This greatly improves their texture. Regular white mushrooms can 
  be used if that's your only reasonable option. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Beef, Chicken or Pork can 
  be used. The pattern recipe calls for Water with a teaspoon of chicken 
  stock granules.</li>
