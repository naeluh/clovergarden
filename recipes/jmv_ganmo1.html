<h1>Ganmo</h1>
<br><img src="img/jmv_ganmo1f.jpg" alt="Ganmo Patty and Balls" class="mrg">

This is the prototype veggie burger - no attempt at this point to make 
it taste like beef though. Ganmo are made in the form of patties, 
similar to hamburger patties, or balls, similar to meatballs. They 
are made of tofu and grated or slivered vegetables, then deep fried 
in oil.

<p>I favor patties over balls as they have more surface area and become 
crisp and firm. Balls tend to be a bit mushy inside. I suggest making a 
double recipe as it's hardly more effort than a single - most of the work 
is in set-up and clean-up.</p>

<p><b>Recipe:</b> &nbsp; There are many variations so the list of 
vegetables here should be considered typical but not mandatory (though 
nearly all have carrot). Many other firm vegetables could be used as 
well and seasonings can be changed.</p>

  <li>Press <b>TOFU</b> for about 3 hours - see below. Use one block, exact 
    size may vary a little.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>SESAME SEEDS</b> to a light golden color.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK MUSHROOM</b> (a dried Shiitake, actually) in warm water 
    for 1/2 hour. Squeeze dry, remove stem and chop fine,</li>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER ROOT</b> and <b>CARROT</b>, chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine,

  <li>Grate <b>GOBO</b> (if used) and immediately cover with cold water 
    acidulated with a little citric acid or lemon juice to prevent browning.
    </li>
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> in a small pan. Squeeze <b>Gobo</b> dry and add 
    it to the pan along with <b>Mushroom mix</b>. Fry stirring for about 
    1-1/2 minutes. Cool.</li>
  <li>Mash <b>Tofu</b> thoroughly. Mix in <b>Vegetable mix</b> and roasted 
    <b>Sesame Seeds</b>.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>Nagaimo</b> (oog, it's like snail snot) and mix into tofu along 
    with <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Mirin</b>. Mix very thoroughly 
    so it's all even.</li>
  <li>Oil your hands lightly and form the mix into balls or patties. Use 
    about 1 heaping tablespoon for balls, </li>
  <li>Heat Oil to 365&deg;F/185&deg;C and fry ganmo a few at a time. When  
    they float separate them and turn them once or twice for even browning. 
    Drain well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Notes</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Gobo</b> &nbsp; Burdock root - use if available. This is a loooong 
    thin brown root. Scrape the brown skin off and grate fine. Immediately 
    set in water with a little citric acid or lemon juice to prevent 
    browning. Squeeze dry before using. For details see our 
    <a href="../ingred/dy_goboz.html"><b>Burdock / Gobo</b></a> page.</li>
  <li><b>Nagaimo Yam</b> &nbsp; [Yamaimo, Mountain Yam, Glutenous Yam] This 
    is available in all the Asian markets around here - but you may not be 
    so lucky. Some say to substitute 1 T cornstarch, others say use 1 T Egg 
    White. The egg white is probably more effective but less vegetarian.
    For more information see our 
    <a href="../ingred/ym_nagaimoz.html"><b>Nagaimo Yam</b></a> page.</li>
  <li><b>Mirin:</b> &nbsp; Real Mirin is a sweetened sake. Every 
    supermarket Asian section has "Mirin Style Cooking Seasoning" - not 
    as tasty by any means, but usable - or just sweeten sake with sugar 
    syrup.</li>

<p><img src="img/jmv_tofupress05e.jpg" alt="Cut tofu on press" class=mrg>
Start with blocks of regular Soft tofu and cut into pieces that will result 
in the desired size (see below). Why not start with Firm tofu which already 
has less water? Because then it wouldn't be Japanese, now would it?</p>
<p>Your press board should be somewhat slanted so liquid will drain 
off into the sink (retired cutting boards are great for this purpose). Most 
people use a dishtowel or cloth napkin instead of the bamboo mat shown in the 
photo (which drains faster but leaves a pattern on one side). Each of two 19 
ounce blocks of tofu has been cut into thirds and set on the mat. If you're 
doing only one block set the slices near the sink end and use a spacer (about 
the height of the finished blocks - I use a wine cork)  between the boards at 
the counter end and put the weights just an inch inboard from 
directly over the tofu slices.<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/jmv_tofupress06e.jpg" alt="Press in operation" class=mrg>
Here the press is in operation with the top board on and bricks for weights. 
Once the tofu was partially pressed I added a third brick across the two. 
I let the tofu press for 3 hours and by then it was quite firm and no 
more water was dripping out. 4 or 5 hours wouldn't hurt though.
<br class=cll></p>
<p><img src="img/jmv_tofupress07e.jpg" alt="Pressed tofu" class=mrg>
Remove any surface water from the blocks with paper towels. The photo shows 
fully pressed blocks. Originally they were 1.3 inches thick and weighed 6.3  
ounces each. After pressing they were 0.8 inches thick and weighed 3.8 ounces 
each.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/jmv_ganmo03e.jpg" alt="Patties & Balls" class=mrg>
The vegetables have been prepped as noted above and lightly fried. The tofu 
has been mashed very thoroughly and mixed with all the other ingredients. 
The finished mix has been formed into patties and balls and arranged on a 
lightly oiled foil, ready to fry.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/jmv_ganmo04e.jpg" alt="Frying" class=mrg>
Heat plenty of oil to 365&deg;F/185&deg;C and fry the tofu to the degree 
desired. When the balls or patties float to the surface separate them and 
turn them over once or twice for even frying. Commercially in Japan two 
deep fryers are used, a first at about 340&deg;F/170&deg;C and the final at 
about 385&deg;F/195&deg;C. I have found trying to imitate this with a single 
frier impractical.</p>
<p>Here 6 ganmo balls are frying in my favorite deep fry 
rig. That's a 14 inch Indian kadhai charged with Olive Pomace oil and  
fitted with a wire base and draining rack designed for Chinese woks. The 
geometry of the kadhai is much better than a wok for deep frying and results 
in less oil splatter than with any other device (they do a lot of deep frying 
in India and can't afford to waste oil).</p>
<p>Olive Pomace oil provides the same 
health profile as regular olive oil but goes to a very high temperature 
(460&deg;F/240&deg;C), is more resistant to heat degradation than peanut oil 
(1/3 as much polyunsaturated fat) and imparts no olive flavor to the food 
you fry in it. For more information see our  
<a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/jmv_ganmo07e.jpg" alt="Draining" class=mrg>
Here finished patties rest on the drainage rack. A final draining on paper 
towels will finish the operation. Refrigerated they'll last about a week and 
they can be frozen for longer storage. Warming to room temperature and a 
quick deep or pan fry will revive them.
