In Japan, this very popular street vendor offering is always made with 
seafood, and often even chicken - so we call this version "Japan / 
California". All items are cut large, because they are served 
"by the piece".

  <b><u>Broth</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/2 hrs - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Break <b>KELP</b> into very large pieces. Place in a pot along with 
    dried <b>Shiitakes</b> and 8 cups of cold water. Let soak for 3 or 
    4 hours.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Kelp mix</b> to a boil, and just as it comes to a full 
    boil, remove the kelp, leaving the Shiitakes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Nori</b>. Simmer slowly for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in remaining <b>Broth items</b>. Bring back to a simmer for 
    about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour through a fine strainer. Press the solids to expel all liquid 
    and discard solids. You should have about 6-1/2 cups of Broth.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
    <br>Note: all hard items such as daikon, potatoes, carrots, etc, 
    traditionally have the sharp edges shaved off (a vegetable peeler 
    works fine). Options are in parentheses.
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Hard boil <b>EGGS</b> (the smallest you can find), remove shells 
    and set aside. For best method see <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html">
    <b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>Group-1:</b> &nbsp; Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>POTATOES</b>. 
    Cut into largish chunks. (Options: &nbsp; Turnip 6 oz, Lotus Root 
    4oz, Fresh Shiitakes 3 oz, Burdock Root (Gobo) 6oz, Bamboo Shoots 
    6 oz, Wakame 1/4 oz). Mix.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>SGroup-2:</b> &nbsp; Cut <b>KONNYAKU</b> into medium 
    narrow triangles. Cut <b>DAIKON</b> into thick disks or half moons 
    (depending on size) Bevel edges. (Options: &nbsp; Gluten Roll). 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Prep <b>Group-3:</b> &nbsp; If needed, cut <b>Deep Fried Tofu</b>. 
    Mix with <b>Eggs</b>. (Options: &nbsp; Kabocha Squash 6 oz, Firm 
    Tofu 5 ounces, Snap Peas 4 oz, Scallions 3 oz). Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Bring <b>Broth</b> back up to a boil and stir in 4 T <b>Mirin</b>, 
    4 T <b>Soy Sauce</b> and 1 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li  id="01">
  <h3>Nori:</h3> &nbsp; This is the thin sheets of paper-like seaweed 
  used to wrap things in sushi bars. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/algae.html"><b>Algae</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or white boiling 
  potatoes work well here. DO NOT use "Yukon Gold" type potatoes, they 
  will disintegrate into mush and wreck you Oden. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Konnyaku:</h3> &nbsp; [Yam Cake] This item appears in every Oden 
  recipe I've seen. It's available in Japanese and Korean markets. The 
  triangles should be about 3/4 inch by 1/2 inch at the big end and about 
  2-1/2 inches long. Pieces should be long enough to force the guests to 
  bite them, so they learn it's much more firm than other jells and \
  needs to be chewed. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_konjaz.html"><b>Konjac / Konnyaku</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Daikon:</h3> &nbsp; Select small Daikons that can be cut into 
  whole wheels. Larger Daikons tend to be fibrous - you don't notice it 
  raw, but it's unpleasant cooked.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Deep Fried Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; [Ag&eacute;] This is available in 
  various sizes in just about every Asian market (except Korean) here 
  in Los Angeles. Cubes about 1 inch on a side are good. If need be, 
  you can fry your own per our recipe 
  <a href="jmv_age1.html"><b>Thick Ag&eacute;</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard:</h3> &nbsp; The standard condiment is paste made from 
  powdered mustard (Asian or Coleman's powder, 1 T to 
  1/2 T water). This is way too sharp for my unsuspecting guests, so I 
  put out Gulden's Spicy Brown.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Kabocha:</h3> &nbsp; This is a hard winter squash now widely 
  available in North America, because many tons are grown in California 
  (originally for export to Japan). Other hard winter squash can be 
  used. Peel, cube large, and cook in Group-3.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Wakame:</h3> &nbsp; This is a tangled dried seaweed found in just 
  about every Asian market. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_wakamz.html"><b>Wakame</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Burdock Root:</h3> &nbsp; [Gobo] This long root can be found in 
  most Asian markets. It's the things that look like wine corks in our 
  photo - they turn gray due to high iron content. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/dy_goboz.html"><b>Burdock Root</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Lotus Root:</h3> &nbsp; This is found in most Asian  markets. 
  Most conveniently it is often available in plastic bags, peeled, or 
  peeled and sliced. If you peel and slice your own, don't cut them too 
  thick because they remain very crunchy even after long cooking. They're 
  the white disks with holes in them in the photo. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pr_lotusz.html"><b>Lotus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Gluten Rolls:</h3> &nbsp; This is a vegetarian meat substitute 
  found in many Asian markets in a number of forms. It's made of wheat 
  gluten, so must be avoided by Celiacs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_whtglutz.html"><b>Wheat Gluten</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Snap Peas:</h3> &nbsp; These are the fresh "peas in the pod" that 
  have the edible pod, but are much thicker than Snow Peas.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The best way to serve this dish is as a 
  buffet item. Transfer it into a large slow cooker set to "Keep Warm". 
  Provide a slotted spoon or tongs so guests can pick out what pieces 
  they want. Provide a dish of mustard with a small cocktail 
  spoon in it. Tell guests how to select pieces, and how to use the 
  mustard, not that they're going to pay the least bit of attention 
  to what you say.</li>
