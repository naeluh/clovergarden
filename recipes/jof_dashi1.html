Dashi is one of the most important Japanese cooking basics. Given here 
is the authentic recipe for Ichiban Dashi, superior in delicacy and aroma, 
especially if you shave your own dried fermented Bonito (it's harder than 
a board, and takes special tools).

Ichiban Dashi has fallen out of use in Japanese households since the mid 
20th century. Dashi-no-moto (instant dashi) is good enough for most uses, 
particularly the Hon Dashi (true dashi) varieties, and takes only seconds. 
Niban Dashi is for uses less critical than clear soups, an economy 
measure, and pretty rank. Do read <a href="jof_dashi1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b><u>Ichiban (1st) Dashi</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>KELP</b> and <b>Cold Water</b> in a saucepan, and heat 
    over very moderate flame so the Kelp has some soak time. Pull the 
    kelp just as the water comes to a boil. Reserve for Niban Dashi.</li>
  <li>Allow <b>Water</b> to come to a full boil, then add 1/2 cup 
    <b>Cold Water</b> and immediately stir in <b>Bonito Flake</b>. Let 
    the water return to a boil but only for 2 to 3 seconds. Take off 
    the heat. </li>
  <li>Strain through muslin or similar, wringing liquid through and 
    reserving <b>Bonito Flakes</b> with the reserved <b>Kelp</b>.</li>
  <li>The Dashi should be used right away, before it loses aroma and 
    subtle notes of flavor</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Niban (2nd) Dashi</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place reserved <b>Bonito and Kelp</b> in a saucepan with 6 cups 
    of cold water. Bring just to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, and 
    simmer uncovered about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/2 oz fresh <b>Bonito Flakes</b>. Take off the heat 
    and let stand about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Strain through muslin or similar, wringing liquid through. 
  </ol> 
<b><u>Hon Dashi</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Bring <b>Cold Water</b> to a boil. Take off the heat. Stir in 
    <b>Hon Dashi</b> granules - Done.</li>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kelp:</h3> &nbsp; [Konbu, Kombu (Japan); Miyeok, Dashima (Korea); 
  Haidai (China); <i>Laminaria japonica</i>] &nbsp; 
  This wide, flat dried seaweed can be found in any market serving a 
  Japanese or Korean community, and in most markets serving other East 
  and Southeast Asian communities. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_konbuz.html"><b>Kelp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bonito Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This is bonito fillets 
  that have been smoked, carefully fermented and then dried. 
  These fillets are hard as a board, a hardwood board, and need special 
  tools to flake. In North America it is available pre-flaked in 
  markets serving a Japanese or Korean community. Flavor fades with 
  time, so don't store it too long. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfshdry.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted &amp; 
  Smoked</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hon Dashi:</h3> &nbsp; [True Dashi] &nbsp; This is 
  a higher grade of <b>Dashi-no-moto</b> (granulated instant dashi stock) 
  indicating it is actually made using real Kelp and Bonito, rather than 
  cleverly faked. It may still be laced with MSG and salt.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; OK, lets be brutally honest here. If you are 
  serving a clear soup to a Samurai, who happens also to be an epicure, 
  and he's carrying a lot of razor sharp cutlery, and you can get his 
  soup on the table the moment the dashi is done (and you'd better be 
  able to), then you want to make the Ichiban Dashi. Other than that, 
  you may want to go with the Hon Dashi version (yes it is noticeably 
  less delicate, but for Western tastes, you may even prefer it). You'll 
  also save money - Kelp and Bonito Flake are expensive in retail 
  packaging. The Niban Dashi is really pretty rank, tasting mostly of 
  overcooked kelp.</li>
