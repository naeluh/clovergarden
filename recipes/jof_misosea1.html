I don't claim "authenticity" for this soup because I just made it up, 
but all the ingredients are authentic and so is the method. It's quite 
convenient for using up small items of seafood left in my freezer.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>KELP</b> and <b>Water</b> in a pot over very moderate 
    flame so it has some soak time. Pull the kelp just as the water comes 
    to a boil. A little of it can be sliced into shreds to add back to 
    the soup. I just  eat the rest.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>MIXED SEAFOOD</b> as needed and cut into small pieces. 
    See <a href="jof_misosea1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>When you've removed the kelp, take just a little of the hot water 
    and mix it with the <b>Miso</b> until the miso is smooth.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Mixed Seafood</b> to the pot and bring it up to a simmer. 
    That should be all the cooking it needs.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Dashi-no-moto</b> into the soup, then <b>Miso</b>. The 
    soup should be brought up hot but not boil at this point</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mixed Seafood:</h3> This can be just about any seafood, but use 
  only non-oily fish. An oily fish overpowers the soup.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dashi-no-moto</h3> This is a granulated instant dashi stock very 
  much used in Japan today, as making Dashi the original way is more 
  expensive and takes careful attention. Better grades are labeled 
  "Hon Dashi" (True Dashi), indicating they are actually made from kelp 
  and dried bonito, not cleverly faked.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>White Fish</h3> are tiny anchovies about 1 inch 
  long, generally sold as a frozen block of hundreds of fish. just hold 
  a corner of the block under hot water and catch fish that fall off in 
  a strainer. Put the rest of the block back in the freezer.</li>
