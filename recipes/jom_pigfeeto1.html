  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Roast <b>PIG'S FEET</b> in the broiler skin side up until a few 
    blackened spots appear (see <a href="jom_pigfeeto1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Put <b>Pig Feet</b> into a large pot and cover 
    with water by about 2 inches as they'll swell a bit. Bring the pot to 
    a boil over high heat for about 2 minutes, then pour it all out into 
    the sink. Wash the pot and rinse the pig feet, returning them to the pot. 
    Add 4 quarts of water and bring to a boil for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and add to the pot, then turn down to a 
    simmer for another 1 hour.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Soak the <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water 
    for about 1/2 hour. Stem and quarter them and set aside.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>KONBU</b> for about 1/2 hour. Cut into strips about 3/4 
    inch by 2 inches and set aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKONS</b> and cut into about 1 inch lengths, then into 
    half moons.</li>
  <li>When <b>Pig's Feet</b> have cooked their time, pull them out of 
    the broth and de-fat the broth using your gravy separator or some 
    other device. Wash the pot and return both the broth and the pig 
    feet.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Daikon</b>, <b>Konbu</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Awamori</b>. Simmer another 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSTARD GREENS</b> into strips about 3/4 inch by 2 inches and 
    parboil briefly. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir some hot broth into the <b>Miso</b> and blend, then add to the 
    pot. Check your stock for salt and flavor - if you think it needs a 
    bit more flavor stir in <b>Dashi</b>. Take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve in individual bowls, a hunk or two of pig foot, some konbu, 
    daikon and mushrooms, and a few strips of mustard greens.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; Buy pig feet cut in half 
  lengthwise (bandsawed, actually) and twice crosswise so all pieces are 
  less than 4 inches long. Many ethnic markets have them already cut in 
  shrink-wrap trays. You can cut feet yourself using a very sharp Chinese 
  cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet. For details see our
  <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig Feet</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Broiling:</h3> &nbsp; This comes from the former 
  need to singe the feet to remove hairs. Pig feet sold here have no 
  hair. This operation contributes to color but little to flavor, so 
  can be omitted.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; Also called 
  "Forest Mushroom", these  are actually dried shiitakis. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04"><h3>Konbu - Kelp:</h3> &nbsp; Nishimi Konbu, thinner 
  than regular konbu, is used in Okinawa, but a thin sheet of regular can 
  be used. About 6  inches by 6 inches will do. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_konbuz.html"><b>Konbu / Kelp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Daikon:</h3> &nbsp; Use small daikons because 
  large ones have stiff fibers you don't notice when raw, but they make 
  them unpleasant cooked.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Awamori:</h3> &nbsp; The Okinawan version of Japanese Shochu. It 
  is more aromatic and up to 43% alcohol vs. 25% for Shochu. A 
  liquor single distilled from fermented rice, Shochu tastes a lot like 
  sake with some vodka in it. Since neither awamori nor shochu is easily 
  available in most of the US you can just use sake with a little vodka 
  in it, or even just sake.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Hon Dashi</h3> &nbsp; This is a dry powdered soup stock made 
  largely kelp and dried bonito - available at any market serving a 
  Japanese or Korean community.</li>
