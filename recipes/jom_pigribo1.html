Okinawan cuisine is a blend of Japanese and Chinese with it's own individual 
flair.  It's very closely related to one of Okinawa's most famous dishes,

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; .Weight is with all excess 
  fat trimmed off. I prefer the parts with a lot of cartilage rather than 
  bone.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; Also called "Forest Mushroom", these  
  are actually dried shiitakis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Konbu - Kelp:</h3> &nbsp; Nishimi Konbu, thinner 
  than regular konbu, is used in Okinawa, but a thin sheet of regular can 
  be used. About 6  inches by 6 inches will do. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_konbuz.html"><b>Konbu / Kelp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Daikon:</h3> &nbsp; Use small daikons because 
  large ones have stiff fibers you don't notice when raw, but they make 
  them unpleasant cooked.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Hon Dashi</h3> &nbsp; This is a dry powdered soup stock made largely 
  kelp and dried bonito - available at any market serving a Japanese or 
  Korean community. For details see our 
  <a href="jof_dashi1.html"><b>Dashi</b></a> page.</li>
