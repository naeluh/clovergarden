<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with all excess fat removed. Any 
  cut will do fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Leek:</h3> &nbsp; Asian preferred, but a small Western leek will work 
  fine. For details see our <a href="../ingred/li_onion.html#leek">
  <b>Leeks</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer the small King Trumpet mushrooms 
  but others can be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Miso:</h3> &nbsp; Various light, medium, and even dark Misos are 
  used, depending on region. There are two ways to incorporate it into 
  soups. Traditionally it was placed in a <a href="../ke/ke_surib.html">
  <b>Suribachi</b></a> bowl, some hot soup added, and then mushed smooth 
  with a pestle for adding to the soup. Today it is often placed in a  
  <a href="../ke/ke_koshi.html"><b>Miso Koshi</b></a>, which is dipped into 
  the soup and the pestle is used to push it through the mesh. Miso should 
  have very little cooking.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kelp:</h3> &nbsp; A very common seaweed, carried in just about any 
  market that sells Asian foods. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_konbuz.html"><b>Konbu / Kelp</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mitsuba:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have <a href="../ingred/py_mitsuz.html">
  <b>Mitsuba</b></a>, found only in Japanese and some Korean markets, use other 
  herbs. I use 2/3 Flat Leaf Parsley and 1/3 Cilantro. Mitsuba is very fragile 
  and quickly turns to bitter mush with cooking, so it is placed in individual 
  bowls, soup ladled over, and served immediately. With other herbs you have 
  more options.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I added the step to boil and rinse the Pork to 
  prevent scum from rising. The pattern recipe said to skim it off, but that's 
  not easy with all those finely cut vegies floating around. The pattern 
  recipe included 3 oz of Gobo Root (Burdock) sliced on a diagonal. The photo 
  example included Gobo, but I removed it from my recipe. I increased the 
  Daikon and Carrot a little, and added Mushrooms, which the pattern recipe 
  admitted many do. Most in North America have imperfect access to Gobo Root, 
  it's difficult to handle, and throws a little white sludge when cooking - 
  but it's supposed to have an affinity with Pork. </li>
