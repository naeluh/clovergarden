  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for 1/2 hour. Discard the stems 
    and slice the caps into 1/8 inch strips.</li>
  <li>Rinse or soak <b>WAKAME</b> (see <a href="jon_udoveg1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>) 
    and cut it into strips about 3/8 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Remove the central rib from <b>CHARD</b> and cut into strips about 
    3/8 inch wide and 3 inches long. Weight is measured after removing 
    the big central rib.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CABBAGE</b> leaves crosswise about 3/8 inches wide. Slice  
    <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin crosswise (white and green). Mix both with 
    Chard.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using dried Udon noodles, cook in boiling salted water 
    same as any other noodles. They should be cooked softer than Italian 
    pasta. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Bring <b>Water</b> to a boil and turn off heat. Stir in <b>Dashi</b> 
    and <b>Salt</b>, then <b>Mushrooms</b> and <b>Vegetable mix</b>. Bring 
    back up to just short of a simmer for as long as it takes for the 
    Cabbage stems to be crisp tender, then stir in <b>Wakame</b> and turn 
    off heat.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: Bring water for the <b>Udon</b> to a boil.</li>
  <li>Drop <b>Udon</b> into boiling water long enough to heat through. Use 
    tongs to distribute into serving bowls.</li>
  <li>Use tongs to distribute vegetables into the serving bowls, then a 
    ladle to distribute the broth.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Wakame:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very commonly available 
  seaweed, dried in plastic bags or salted in plastic bags found in the 
  refrigerated section of Asian markets. I prefer the salted as it tastes 
  fresher and is more crunchy. Weight is for salted with the salt shaken 
  off - for dried use a little less and soak it until soft. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/al_wakamz.html"><b>Wakame</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chard:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with the stems cut away. In Japan this 
  might be Umaina or another beet green. Swiss Chard is an easily 
  available beet green, a bit coarser in texture but just fine in this 
  soup. The pattern recipe calls for "spinach", but that would have a 
  mushy texture in soup, and is not a beet green.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hon Dashi</h3> &nbsp; (hon means "true"). This instant soup base 
  is made from kelp and shaved dried bonito fish and is easily available 
  in any market serving a Japanese or Korean community. Alternatively 
  you can make your own dashi in various ways, including vegetarian 
  (usually made from mushroom soaking liquid and kelp). For details, 
  see our recipe <a href="jof_dashi1.html"><b>Dashi</b></a>. A little 
  Shiro Miso would not hurt this soup either.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Udon:</h3> &nbsp; These are thick Japanese flour noodles. Weight 
  is for packaged cooked noodles (found in the refrigerated cases of 
  Asian markets). If you have only dried, you will need to boil them 
  in salted water like any other noodles until they are soft (they 
  should be cooked softer than Italian pasta).</li>
