Japan learned about Curry Powder from the British Royal Navy, and adjusted 
it to Japanese tastes. Curries have been very popular in Japan since the 
late 1800s (see <a href="jys_curpjp1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>).

  <li>In a dry skillet over moderate heat, separately roast all 
    <b>Toasted items</b>, stirring until they are aromatic and darken just 
    a shade. Pour out on a plate to cool.</li>
  <li>When toasted spices are cool, grind together with all <b>Just 
    Ground items</b> to a fine powder in your spice grinder 
    (see <a href="jys_curpjp1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). 
  <li>Mix <b>All Ingredients</b> thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Package in an airtight jar. Kept away from heat and sunlight it should 
    keep for several months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; You can use White (favored in Asia), Black 
  (favored by me), or 1/2 of each (some published recipes).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This amount presumes Japones chilis, which are 
  not excessively hot. Some recipes do not include Chilis. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Spice Grinder:</h3> &nbsp; A little whirling blade coffee 
  grinder works well for this job, in batches, but an Indian  
  <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> will do the whole recipe in 
  5 seconds.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; While curry dishes are very popular in Japan, 
  and recipes abound on the Internet, of my 23 Japanese cookbooks, only one 
  (WASHOKU, Elizabeth Andoh, 2006) even admits that Curries exist in Japan. 
  Even she doesn't give a curry powder recipe, but presumes you will use 
  "old fashioned" curry powder in "small tins" (presumably Sun or Ship brand, 
  Anglo-Indian powders) She also mentions blocks of Curry Roux, made from 
  curry powder and animal fats. She says both powder and roux are still 
  "immensely popular" in Japan and does give recipes for Rice Curry (the 
  most popular) and Chicken Curry.</li>
