An appetizer to impress. Attractive and wonderfully tasty - and very quick to 
cook. Best served warm, but still be appreciated at room temperature.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (23 minutes)
  <ol>
  <li>Shell and devein <b>SHRIMP</b>. You can leave the tails on if you 
    like. I don't split the backs to devein, see our 
    <a href="../ingred/seashrimpw.html#prep"><b>Working with Shrimp & 
    Prawns</b></a> page for method. (23 min)</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Garnish items</b> as desired.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (you need plenty of room for tumbling 
    the shrimp), melt <b>Butter</b>, no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, and bring to a simmer stirring. Simmer 
    for a couple minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Shrimp</b>. Keep tumbling them, not constantly, but 
    very often, to keep them coated with the sauce. Cook them until they are 
    just done. Depending on the heat under you pan, this could take from 
    4 to 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, with a bit of the sauce, and garnished as desired. As an 
    appetizer, I'd say about 5 shrimp (Medium Large) per person, or they'll 
    feel deprived. These are really delicious.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Shell-on, Head-off. Medium or Large are 
  fine, unless you really want to show off. Do not buy pre-cooked shrimp, 
  they are nearly flavorless. See <a href="../ingred/seashrimpw.html#size">
  <b>Size Table</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Gochujang:</h3> &nbsp; This Chili Paste is an essential seasoning for 
  Korean cuisine, and is not very hot. It is available in all Korean markets. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_gochujz.html"><b>Gochujang</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flakes</h3> &nbsp; These MUST be Korean chili flakes, or 
  the hotness will be all wrong. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Japanese &amp; Korean Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome, but also used in 
  China and Korea. If you are unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, butter was little used in Korean 
  cooking, but lately, under the influence of TV cooking shows, it has become 
  much more common.</li>
