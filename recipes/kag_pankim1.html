  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Dipping Sauce</b> (if using - recommended). Just mix all 
    ingredients together.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Kimchi</b>, 1/2 inch wide or less. Slice thick part of 
    <b>SCALLION</b> in half lengthwise, then cut whole Scallion diagonally 
    into about 1-1/2 inch lengths. Cut Onion lengthwise into quarters and 
    slice thin. Mix all</li>
  <li>Make Batter:  &nbsp; Beat <b>Egg</b> lightly. Place all <b>Batter 
    items</b> (except water) in a spacious mixing bowl. Pour a little of 
    the <b>Icy Water</b> over the Gochujang and mash it up well. Then start 
    stirring <b>Icy Water</b> into the bowl, mixing everything well. Don't 
    over-mix, just until even and reasonably lump free. The batter should 
    flow easily off a spoon, add more water if it doesn't.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Kimchi mix</b> into the <b>Batter</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min per pancake)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a seasoned iron skillet or similar device (see <a href="kag_pankim1.html#07">
    <b>Note-7</b></a>), heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> to about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Ladle in enough <b>Batter mix</b> for the size pancake you want to 
    make. Spread it out quite thin and keep over fairly high heat. Regulate 
    your heat so it never exceeds 400&deg;F/200&deg;C or spots on the top 
    side will be blackened before the pancake is properly set.</li>
  <li>When the Pancake is set sufficiently, lift it with a thin metal turner 
    to let oil run underneath for even cooking.</li>
  <li>When the Pancake is set sufficiently and the edges are lightly browned, 
    use the thin metal turner to flip it over, controlling it with a wooden 
    spatula. Pour some more oil around it and fry until the top side is set 
    and has browned spots. It helps to lift it a bit when it's firm enough 
    so oil can run under it. Add more Oil and repeat until all batter is 
    used.</li> 
  <li>Keep Pancakes warmed until you get them all done. Cut into convenient 
    sizes and serve warm with <b>Dip</b>, or as desired. They can also be 
    eaten at room temperature, but they reheat easily.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kimchi:</h3> &nbsp; This <u>must</u> be a fully fermented cabbage 
  Kimchi, with plenty of Kimchi Juice included. Buy a live Kimchi from the 
  refrigerated cases of a Korean market. See buying recommendations on our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_kimchiz.html"><b>Kimchi</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; All Purpose Flour [Plain Flour, UK] is fine. The 
  1/4 cup can be swapped out for Sweet Rice Flour, Corn Starch or Potato 
  Starch.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Gochujang:</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential seasoning for Korean 
  cuisine. It is available in all Korean markets. It can be replaced by 
  1/2 Tablespoon of Korean Chili Flake (Gochugaru). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_gochujz.html"><b>Gochujang</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Egg</h3> &nbsp; The Egg helps hold the pancake together, so use it 
  unless you're trying to be Vegan Pure. If so, make the pancakes smaller - 
  also, read the ingredients on your Kimchi, usually some seafood is included. 
  You may need to make your own, which should be fermented at least a week. 
  See our recipe <a href="kpv_kccabj1.html"><b>Cabbage Cut & Jumbled 
  Kimchi</b></a> recipe and skip the Fish Sauce, or see our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_vegfish1.html"><b>Vegetarian Fish Sauce - Clear</b></a>. 
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a high temperature oil. I like Olive Pomace Oil 
  for frying, but Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) will work well enough. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Various Mushrooms can be used, but for this 
  recipe they need sliced into thin strips and fried until tender before use. 
  If using fresh Shiitakes, soak them just as if they were dried before 
  cutting and frying, this changes their texture from tough to silky.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; I use a 10 inch iron skillet, which gives me room 
  for pancakes 6 to 7 inches across, weighing about 4.8 ounces each. This 
  size is quite manageable. The batter amount given will make 5 of these, 
  or about 1.5 pounds.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe will consume a fair amount of oil. 
  Fortunately, the <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has 
  been thoroughly discredited, and you can compensate with lower calorie 
  foods before and after.</li>
