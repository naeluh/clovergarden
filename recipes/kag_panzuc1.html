  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Dipping Sauce</b>. Just mix all ingredients together.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ZUCCHINI</b> into lengths depending on size of your pancakes, 1 
    inch for small, 2 inches for large. Cut these into matchsticks about 1/8 
    inch on a side. Place in a bowl and tumble with 1 t <b>Salt</b> until 
    well mixed. Let sit for at least 10 minutes until wilted.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise. Set one half flat on the cutting 
    board and slice lengthwise as you would for chopping fine, tilting the 
    knife so the edge points to the centerline where the onion touches the 
    board. Cut off the root end to free the slices. If your Onion is large, 
    and pancakes small, cut the slices in half. Separate all the layers.</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>Chilis</b>, remove the veins to reduce heat - or leave 
    them in if you want heat. Cut lengthwise into thin strips, then cut strips 
    in half and mix with Onions.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Zucchini</b> hard to remove as much water as you can, 
    <u>reserving all the water</u>. Add to the <b>Onions</b> and toss to 
    distribute evenly.</li> 
  <li>Make Batter:  &nbsp; In a large mixing bowl, beat <b>Eggs</b> moderately.  
    Mix with <b>Buchim Garu</b>, then the reserved <b>Zucchini Water</b>. Work 
    out any lumps.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Zucchini mix</b> into the Batter until even. It may be a little 
    stiff at first, but should become more liquid in a few minutes. If still 
    stiff, add tablespoon or so of <b>Water</b> until it is right.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min per batch)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a seasoned iron skillet or similar device (see <a href="kag_panzuc1.html#07">
    <b>Note-7</b></a>), heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> to about 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. 
    Avoid letting it get over 400&deg;F/200&deg;C while you work.</li>
  <li>Ladle in enough <b>Batter mix</b> for the size pancake you want to 
    make. Spread it out fairly thin and keep over fairly high heat. I cover 
    the skillet with a lid from a saut&eacute; pan to encourage the top to 
    set.</li>
  <li>When the Pancake is set sufficiently, lift it with a thin turner to let 
    oil run underneath for even cooking.</li>
  <li>When the Pancake is set sufficiently and the edges are lightly browned, 
    use the thin turner to flip it over, controlling it with a wooden spatula. 
    Pour a little more oil around it and fry until the top side is set and has 
    browned spots. Add Oil as needed and repeat until all batter is used.</li> 
  <li>Keep Pancakes warmed until you get them all done. Cut into convenient 
    sizes and serve warm with <b>Dip</b>. They are also just fine eaten at 
    room temperature, and they reheat easily.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Zucchini:</h3> &nbsp; Use young green Zucchini, about 7 ounces each. 
  In Korea this recipe may be made with <a href="../ingred/sq_hobakz.html">
  <b>Aehobak</b></a>, which looks much like a Zucchini but is a different 
  kind of squash with a somewhat different flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Green:</h3> &nbsp; I use Jalap&ntilde;o Chilis, since Korean 
  Chilis are of uncertain availability, even here in Southern California. 
  Cored and veins removed they contribute little heat.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Buchim Garu:</h3> &nbsp; This is the universal Korean pancake mix 
  and batter base for pan frying. It is widely available commercially, in 
  Korean markets or on-line, but it takes only about 5 minutes to make by 
  our recipe <a href="kig_bugar1.html"><b>BuChim Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a high temperature oil. I like Olive Pomace Oil 
  for frying, but Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) will work well enough. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Korean Chili Flake is usually quite mild, so 
  the amount given here shouldn't cause problems for anyone.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; a 10 inch iron skillet is fine for making 8 inch 
  pancakes, or 2ea 4 inch if made a little oval. A 12 inch iron skillet will 
  allow 3ea 4 inch pancakes, or 4ea if made a bit oval. On the other hand, 
  the oil is never deep, so most griddles will work fine too.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe will consume a fair amount of oil. 
  Fortunately, the <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has 
  been thoroughly discredited, and you can compensate with lower calorie 
  foods before and after.</li>
