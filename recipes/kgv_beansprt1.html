This is one of the most common of the many tiny banchan side dishes 
served with a Korean meal. I can't remember any meal in a Korean 
restaurant at which a bean sprout salad was not served. In the 
quantities usually served with a Korean meal this recipe will easily 
serve 6.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp;  These are the common 
  mung bean sprouts. In a Korean household, the thread-like roots would 
  always be pinched off, which is rather tedious (45 minutes for 12 
  ounces) - but that's what kids are for, right? We barbarians are free 
  to ignore this requirement (unless we have Korean guests). Soy bean 
  sprouts can be used for this recipe, and Soy Sprouts can be purchased 
  with the root end already cut off in some Korean markets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are almost always 
  used. If you don't have them, just dry pan roast white sesame seeds, 
  stirring and shaking, until they are a medium blonde color. For details 
  see our <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a> 
  recipe.</li>
