This is one of the most common of the many tiny banchan side dishes 
served with a Korean meal. I can't remember any meal in a Korean 
restaurant at which a bean sprout banchan was not served. In the 
quantities usually served with a Korean meal this recipe will easily 
serve 6.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp;  Most commonly, these 
  will be Soy Bean Sprouts, but the common mung bean sprouts can be 
  used. In a Korean household, the thread-like roots would always be 
  pinched off, which is rather tedious (40 minutes for 12 ounces) - but 
  that's what kids are for, right?  We barbarians are free to ignore this 
  requirement (unless we have Korean guests). Some Korean markets have 
  packaged soy bean sprouts with the root ends already cut off.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses 
  red ripe Fresnos, but other moderately hot chilis will work. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sesame Salt:</h3> &nbsp; This important seasoning is just white 
  Sesame Seeds dry pan roasted until light golden in color, then cooled 
  and crushed with Salt. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Sesame Salt</b></a>.</li>
