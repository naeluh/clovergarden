This salad is one of the many "banchan" (tiny side dishes) served with 
Korean meals. It is very popular, particularly in the summer. Banchans 
are usually served in rather small portions, but this recipe would also 
serve as 4 or so regular salads.

  <ol>
  <li>Break up <b>WAKAME</b> into small pieces (they will get a lot 
    larger). Soak in cool water about 20 minutes, then drain well and 
    squeeze out excess moisture. The 1-1/4 ounces will have become about 
    11-3/4 ounces.</li>
  <li>Slit <b>SCALLION</b> lengthwise (two slices in the white part) 
    and slice very thin crosswise, including the green part.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing Items</b> together in a small jar.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Seaweed</b> with <b>Scallions</b>. This is best done by 
    hand so you can detect and pull apart lumps, and tear seaweed pieces 
    that are too big.</li>
  <li>Shake <b>Dressing</b> vigorously and mix with <b>Seaweed</b>.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Sesame Seeds</b> and serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Wakame:</h3> &nbsp; [Miyeok (Korea)] &nbsp;  This 
  is a very popular, easy to find seaweed. In this recipe we used it 
  dried, though it is also available salted. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/al_wakamz.html"><b>Wakame</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are almost always 
  used. If you don't have them, just dry pan roast white sesame seeds, 
  stirring and shaking, until they are a medium blonde color. For details 
  see our recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
  Seeds</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comment:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for scalding the soaked 
  wakame in boiling water, for everywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. 
  With a 20 minute soak and squeezing out, I haven't found this at all 
  necessary.</li>
