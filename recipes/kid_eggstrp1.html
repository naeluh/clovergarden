Egg strips are a common Korean garnish, bright yellow and easy to make, 
with yolks. <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html#01"><b>Whites</b></a> are another matter. Whole eggs 
are easy, but the strips are pale yellow.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 min)
  <ol>
  <li>This recipe is best done with two Egg Yolks or one Whole Egg.</li>
  <li>Lightly beat <b>EGG YOLKS</b> (or whole Egg) with a fork - no foam.</li>
  <li>Put a few drops of <b>Oil</b> in a well seasoned omelet pan and wipe 
    with a paper towel to leave only a thin film.</li>
  <li>Heat moderately hot (around 270&deg;F/130&deg;C). Pour the <b>Egg 
    Yolk</b> in quickly and tilt the pan around to make a very thin omelet 
    about 6 inches diameter. Immediately turn the heat to very low. When it 
    is well set on the bottom, use a thin metal turner to flip it over, then 
    turn off heat. Leave until that side is set. Remove to a cutting board.
    </li>
  <li>When the <b>Egg</b> is cool, but not cold, roll it up into a cylinder 
    and slice crosswise into strips as thin as you want, but less than 1/4 
    inch wide. Because they were cold, the photo examples were cut flat on 
    the board.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li class="#01">
  <h3>Whites</h3> &nbsp; Making White Strips is much more difficult than 
  Yolk or Whole Egg strips. It takes more patience and close temperature 
  control. It is likely only one side will look good, and the down side 
  may pick up bits of color from the pan, so make sure it's scrubbed clean.
  <ol>
  <li>Do not attempt to do more than one egg white at a time.</li>
  <li>Scrub your pan very thoroughly, if there is anything on it, the whites 
    will pick it up.</li>
  <li>Beat the Egg White moderately with a fork.</li>
  <li>Oil the pan same as for Yolks, but leave a bit more oil.</li>
  <li>Heat pan to about 250&deg;F/120&deg;C. Pour in the Egg White and 
    swirl it around quickly. Turn the heat down to very low. If your pan 
    is fairly heavy, you can turn it off.</li>
  <li>Cover with a lid to contain the heat, and let the Egg White set all the 
    way through. If you have any heat on, check that the egg is not bubbling 
    at all. Turn off the heat if needed. Don't try to flip it, it's much too 
    tender.</li>
  <li>When the top is set well, take the pan off the heat and let the 
    Egg White cool <u>in the pan</u>.</li>
  <li>Carefully remove the omelet from the pan with a thin metal turner and 
    slice into strips flat on the board, it probably won't take well to 
    rolling up.
