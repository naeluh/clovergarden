Toasted Sesame Seeds are an essential pantry item for cuisines of Korea, 
Japan and Southeast Asia - in Korean so important that "sesame seeds" in 
a recipe can be presumed to mean "toasted sesame seeds"  
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Toasted sesame seeds are available commercially from any Korean market, 
but they are fresher and better made at home, which is very easy. One 
thing - be <u>certain</u> the sesame seeds are not rancid. They are best 
bought from a Korean or other high volume Asian market.

  <li>Place <b>Sesame Seeds</b> in a dry skillet (no oil). Over medium 
    heat, toast the seeds, stirring and shaking the pan very often so 
    the seeds toast evenly. They must never get hot enough to smoke. You 
    may hear some popping. When they have reached a light golden blonde 
    color and taste good, take them off the heat and immediately pour 
    them out onto a plate to cool. &nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> watch the seeds 
    very closely. They should be <u>no darker</u> than in the photo - if 
    they go beyond golden blonde to dirty blonde, they will have started 
    to take on a burned taste. The best way to test is by taste. I just 
    moisten a finger, touch it to the top of the seeds and taste the 
    ones that stick.

This widely used seasoning is extremely easy to make, especially if you 
have already made a supply of toasted sesame seeds - and if you are 
cooking any Korean or Japanese recipes, you certainly should have plenty 
of toasted sesame on hand.
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
The amount of salt can vary from 15 to 1 up to 5 to 1. I like it near 
the low end, so this recipe is 13.6 to 1. The most common ratio in 
Japan seems to be 10 to 1. In Japan this is often made with toasted 
black sesame seeds instead of white, but it's a lot harder to tell 
when they are toasted.
