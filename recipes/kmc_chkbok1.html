  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut into bite size 
    pieces. Keep it pretty thin, as cooking time is very short, depending 
    on the choy selected.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>Chicken</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, then add 
    <b>Egg White</b> and <b>Cornstarch</b>. Massage well into Chicken, 
    then set aside while preparing other items.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>Bok Choy</b> and cut it whichever way you like. For 
    Green Bok Choy or Yu Choy, Stems do not need to be held separate 
    unless they are quite large.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut 
    slices into thin slivers. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> and <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and stir 
    in <b>Chicken</b>. Fry tumbling over medium flame just until it has 
    lost all its raw color. The cornstarch will start to stick to the 
    pan, be careful it does not get beyond medium blonde in color, 
    because it will become part of the sauce. The Chicken will not be 
    fully cooked at this point.</li>
    <li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> from the pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> just until 
    aromatic (a few seconds). Stir in <b>Choy Stems</b> (if separate) and 
    fry stirring 1-1/2  to 4 minutes, depending on type, then stir in 
    <b>Leaves</b> until coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Sauce Mix</b>. Bring to a boil. 
    Scrape up fond stuck to the pan into the sauce. Simmer covered, 
    turning frequently, until Yu Choy stems are crisp tender and Chicken 
    is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes - do not overcook.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Stir up 
    <b>Cornstarch mix</b> and quickly stir into the pan until the 
    sauce thickens.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed rice - medium grain for 
    authentically Korean, or Long Grain Jasmine if preferred.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless chicken. I 
  always use thigh and leg meat because it has better texture and flavor 
  than the cardboard chicken breasts produced in North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bok Choy:</h3> &nbsp; Green Shanghai Bok Choy, sold as "Baby" Bok 
  Choy in supermarkets is a good choice that's widely available. Select 
  the smallest you can find. Here in Los Angeles we have many choices, 
  and I prefer to use tiny Bok Choy. Other Choys can be used, but except 
  for Shanghai Bok Choy and Yu Choy, the stems should be kept separate 
  and given a longer lead time over the leaves. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> Use a good drinkable Chinese rice 
  wine. The cooking versions are heavily salted and not that good to start 
  with. If you don't have the rice wine use a dry sherry. Sake, though 
  made from rice, is not considered a good substitute, it's beer, not 
  wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. Quality varies widely. 
  My current favorite is Megachef (Thai), but it isn't as widely 
  available as Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u>, which is also very good - 
  very Chinese looking bottle, but made in Los Angeles. Yes, these are 
  more expensive, but for a reasons - much higher oyster content, 
  unleaded and no melamine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was made with one of more 
  than a dozen Bok Choys available in Los Angeles. This one was very 
  small heads sort of half way between green Shanghai Bok Choy and white 
  stemmed Bok Choy. I did keep the stems separate but gave them less 
  than 2 minutes lead over the leaves. The photo example is garnished 
  with Korean Chili Threads.</li>
