A simple, flavorful,easy to make dish. I generally eat it alone with 
rice, I make it with a fair amount of sauce. As with most Korean 
recipes, I have cut the amount of sugar in half.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min &nbsp; + 4 hrs marinade)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite size chunks.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine. Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Chicken</b> and set aside for 
    about 4 hours.</li>
  <li>Seed <b>BELL PEPPER</b> and cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin on a steep diagonal, white and green. Set 
    aside some for Garnish. Mix the rest with the Bell Pepper.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Lift <b>Chicken pieces</b> from the Marinade, reserving the 
    Marinade (there won't be much).</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> hot. Stir 
    in <b>Chicken</b> and fry over high heat until exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and chicken is lightly browned. Watch the fond in the 
    pan, it should be reddish. If it starts to darken to chocolate, go 
    to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in enough <b>Water</b> to just about cover the chicken, 
    and the reserved <b>Marinade</b>. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer 
    slowly for about 30 minutes, turning the Chicken now and then.</li> 
  <li>If there is too much liquid, uncover and boil some off. I don't 
    like it too dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bell Pepper mix</b> and simmer another 4 minutes, 
    turning once or twice..</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty steamed rice (medium grain). My favorite is 
    Kokuho Rose from California.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for whole chicken 
  thighs. The author is English, so she doesn't bother to say if they 
  are with or without skin and or bones. The photo appears to show 
  skinless thighs - but in English cookbooks, the photos often don't 
  represent the recipe. She says to make 3 slashes in the thighs, but I 
  see no slashes, and they seem to be coated with a different sauce. I 
  prefer to make it with skinless boneless leg and thigh meat for easier 
  and more even serving. Since the Russians are no longer buying all 
  our dark chicken meat, skinned and deboned thigh-leg meat segments 
  are easily and affordably available.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Salt:</h3> &nbsp; This important seasoning 
  is just white Sesame Seeds dry pan roasted until light golden in color, 
  then cooled and crushed with Salt. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Sesame Salt</b></a>.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comment:</h3> &nbsp; Since I usually have this as a single dish 
  with rice, I like a bit more sauce than the pattern recipe calls for. 
  Since the sauce won't be as concentrated, I use chicken stock rather 
  than water to give it more flavor.</li>
