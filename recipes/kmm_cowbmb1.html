This stir fry recipe, from Korean court cuisine, is unusual in that it 
includes Bamboo Shoots, not common in Korean recipes. It may look complex, 
but is not really difficult.

<p><u>Note</u>: &nbsp; I have cut the amount of Sugar to 1/3 that called 
for by the pattern recipe - use your own best judgement here.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (65 min - 50 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in plenty of water for 1 hour. Remove stems, 
    squeeze out excess water and cut caps into narrow strips.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> very thin across the grain, then into narrow 
    strips.</li>
  <li>Make Marinade; &nbsp; Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Split 
    <b>SCALLION</b> lengthwise and slice very fine crosswise, white 
    and green. Mix all <b>Marinade Items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Mix <b>Beef</b> with sliced <b>Mushrooms</b>. Massage 
    <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Beef mix</b>. Let marinate for around 30 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> into strips 1/8 inch thick and roughly 
    1/4 inch wide, or however works for the kind of shoots you have.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b> if desired (see 
    <a href="kmm_cowbmb1.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MINARI</b> stems about 1-1/2 inches long (no leaves).</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>Red Chilis</b> and cut into thin strips.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Make 1 egg worth of <b>Egg Strips</b>, if using for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Place <b>Seasoning mix</b> in a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Bring some <b>Water</b> to a boil. Dump in <b>Bean Sprouts</b> and 
    cook for about 30 seconds (half that if Mung Bean sprouts are used). 
    Drain well and add to the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b>. 
    Stir in <b>Bamboo Shoots</b> and fry stirring for about 4 minutes.
    Remove, leaving as much oil behind as possible, and add to the Mixing 
    Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add 1 t <b>Oil</b> to the pan and stir in <b>Minari Stems</b>. Fry 
    stirring for about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan, leaving as much 
    oil behind as possible, and add to the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and stir in <b>Beef mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring until beef has completely lost its raw color, about 4 
    minutes. Remove from the pan, leaving as much oil behind as possible, 
    and add to the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Chili Strips</b> to the Mixing Bowl. Reserve as many 
    <b>Egg Strips</b> as you need for garnish, and toss the rest into 
    the Mixing Bowl. Tumble everything together until evenly distributed.
    </li>   
  <li>Serve warm, garnished with <b>Egg Strips</b> and accompanied by 
    plenty of steamed rice (medium grain). If it is necessary to reheat 
    before serving, just give it a quick tumble in a hot wok.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; These are the same dried Shiitakes 
  found in every Asian market and many supermarkets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. Cooking 
  time is very short, so select a tender cut, definitely no tougher than 
  Chuck, and slice thin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Toasted Sesame / Sesame Salt:</h3> &nbsp; These are so 
  important an ingredient you should always have plenty on hand if 
  you do any Korean or Japanese cooking. It's just white Sesame Seeds 
  dry pan roasted until light golden in color. The Sesame Salt is 
  these same toasted seeds pounded with some salt. For details see our 
  recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Sesame Salt</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Best for this recipe are the fairly 
  large, cone shaped shoots now available in vacuum bags in Asian 
  markets. This is a much superior package to canned, offering better 
  flavor and choices of shape. I usually use "Green Bamboo", a medium 
  size shoot that is quite solid, so it slices very well. Other shapes 
  can also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html"><b>Bamboo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; I favor the more sturdy Soy Bean Sprouts, 
  available from any Korean market, but the common Mung Bean Sprouts can 
  be used. Traditional Koreans always pinch off the thread-like root 
  end of the sprouts (jobs like this are what children are for), but 
  we Barbarians often ignore this tedious step. If you do it yourself, 
  it will add 18 minutes to prep time. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_sproutz.html"><b>Bean Sprouts</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Minari:</h3> &nbsp; [Java Water Dropwort; Seri (Japanese)] 
  &nbsp;  This herb, with a very unique flavor, is fairly important in 
  Korea, especially for making kimchee, so can often be found in well 
  stocked Korean markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_wdropz.html"><b>Water Dropwort</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses red ripe Fresnos, 
  but other medium hot chilis can be used. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Korean chili flake, which 
  is just moderately hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Egg Strip Garnish</h3> &nbsp; This a very common Korean garnish, 
  easy to make, and can be made even days in advance. For details see 
  our recipe <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip Garnish</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for two fresh 
  Bamboo Shoots. These are usually available from Asian markets here in 
  Los Angeles, but not most places. They need the leaves peeled off, 
  and are then split in half lengthwise and boiled in an uncovered pot 
  for 1 hour to drive off the cyanide. Then they can be cooled and 
  processed as above. Better flavor than even vacuum packed, but a bit 
  of a hassle.</li>
