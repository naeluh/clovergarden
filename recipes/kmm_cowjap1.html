This is deservedly one of Korea's most famous dishes. The recipe is large 
and a bit involved, but not difficult, if you follow the steps carefully 
and do all prep before you start cooking.

Japchae is very popular in Korea as a party dish, suitable for buffet 
service and potluck events. It is also made vegetarian, but I'd add 
a couple more dried mushrooms for that.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr + 1 hr Mushroom soak)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for at least 1 hour. Remove 
    stems and squeeze out excess water. Slice caps thin.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> thin and cut into matchsticks about 2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Beef</b> and sliced <b>Mushrooms</b>. Crush 
    1 cl <b>GARLIC</b>, chop fine and massage all <b>Marinade items</b> 
    into the <b>Beef mix</b> (or Mushrooms if vegetarian).</li>
  <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil as for any pasta. Stir in 
    <b>NOODLES</b> and stir long enough so they don't stick together. 
    Boil gently until just done, 7 to 8 minutes. They should still be 
    a bit chewy, but no hard spots.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Noodles</b>. Lay them out on the cutting board and make 
    several knife cuts through the pile, at right angles, to make the 
    noodles short enough to be manageable. Place in a large shallow  
    mixing bowl and mix in 1 t <b>Soy Sauce</b> and 1 t 
    <b>Sesame Oil</b> to prevent sticking.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil. Stir in <b>SPINACH</b> for 
    30 seconds <u>no more</u>. Drain and refresh with cold running water. 
    Squeeze out excess water. If leaves are large, spread on cutting 
    board and make a couple of cuts through the pile at right angles.</li>
  <li>Transfer <b>Spinach</b> to a bowl. Mix with 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and 
    1 t <b>Sesame Oil</b>, then add to the bowl with the <b>Noodles</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Scrape <b>CARROT</b> and cut into narrow strips 2 to 2-1/2 inches 
    long. Best to use a Julienning vegetable peeler.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise, then slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick, however makes sense 
    for the kind of mushrooms you are using. For King Trumpets I cut 
    lengthwise into strips.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into lengths of about 2 inches and mix with 
    <b>Mushrooms</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush 3 cl <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix together all 
    <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Egg Strips</b> if using for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="14">
  <li>In a spacious skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 t <b>Oil</b> 
    over medium high heat. Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and fry stirring 
    until just getting tender, about 2 minutes. Add to the bowl with 
    the <b>Noodles</b>.</li>
  <li>Add 1 t <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Stir in the <b>Onions</b> and 
    1/4 t <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring until just translucent, about 
    3 minutes. They should still have some crunch. Add to the bowl with 
    the <b>Noodles</b>.</li>
  <li>Add 2 t <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Mushroom mix</b> and 
    fry stirring until mushrooms are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add to 
    the bowl with the <b>Noodles</b>.</li>
  <li>Add 1 t <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Beef mix</b> and fry 
    stirring until the beef has completely lost its raw color, 3 to 
    4 minutes. Add to the bowl with the <b>Noodles</b>.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Seasonings mix</b> to the bowl with the <b>Noodles</b>. 
    Tumble everything together evenly and transfer to a serving bowl.
    </li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Egg Strips</b> if desired. Serve warm or at room 
    temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; These are the same dried Shiitakes 
  found in every Asian market and many supermarkets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sweet Potato Starch Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; It is <u>essential</u> 
  that Sweet Potato Starch Noodles be used in this recipe. Trying to 
  use mung bean noodles or similar will result in disaster. They are 
  available in Korean and some other Asian markets.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe allows white Button 
  Mushrooms, but I prefer the small King Trumpet mushrooms now available 
  around here. You could use fresh Shiitakes, but soak them for 20 
  minutes in warm water as if they were dried. This transforms their 
  texture.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "light brown 
  sugar". &nbsp; <u>NOTE</u>: &nbsp; I have cut the amount of sugar to 
  1/3 that called for by the pattern recipe. Use your own best judgement 
  here, but I don't think it needs more.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are almost always 
  used. If you don't have them, just dry pan roast white sesame seeds, 
  stirring and shaking, until they are a medium blonde color. For details 
  see our <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use Korean "Soy Sauce for Soup", 
  which has a lighter color for better appearance. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_soysz.html"><b>Soy Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; I use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), but since 
  temperatures are low and cooking is short, practically any reasonably 
  neutral oil can be used.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Egg Strip Garnish</h3> &nbsp; This a very common 
  Korean garnish, easy to make, and can be made even days in advance. 
  For details see our recipe <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip 
  Garnish</b></a>.</li>
