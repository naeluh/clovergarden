The name means "Mixed Noodles". The balance of flavors and textures is 
quite wonderful. Served near room tempeature, it's an excellent dish for 
lunch or dinner on a hot summer day.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 50 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for at least 30 minutes. 
    Wring them out, cut away the stems, and slice them into narrow 
    strips.</li>
  <li>Slice the <b>BEEF</b> thin across the grain and then into narrow 
    strips about 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Make Marinade: &nbsp; Slice <b>SCALLION</b> thin. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Mix <b>Beef</b> with sliced <b>Mushrooms</b> and massage the 
    <b>Marinade</b> into them. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 
    minutes, turning a couple times.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Cucumber</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin diagonally. 
    Mix with <b>Salt</b>. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. Rinse, drain 
    and squeeze out excess water.</li>
  <li>Make Sauce: &nbsp;  Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>RED CHILI</b>. Cut into very thin strips for 
    Garnish.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Egg Strips</b> for Garnish.</li>  
   </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min (with no overlaps))
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or saut&eacute; pan, Heat 1 T <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Beef</b> 
    over high heat, stirring until it has completely lost its raw color. 
    Seeing this is not easy as the beef is already dyed dark, but 5 
    minutes in a very hot pan should do.Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>In the pan, heat 1 t oil and fry the rinsed and squeezed 
    <b>Cucumbers</b> over high heat, stirring for about 3 minutes. 
    Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of salted <b>Water</b> to a rolling boil and boil 
    <b>Noodles</b> until just done (important - see 
    <a href="kmm_cowmrn1.html#9">Note-9</a>. Drain, place in a bowl and mix with 
    <b>Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Tumble in <b>Beef</b> and <b>Cucumbers</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve in individual bowls, garnished with <b>Egg Strips</b> and 
    <b>Chili Strips</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the regular 
  dried Shiitakes available at any Asian market and most supermarkets, 
  usually called "Chinese Black Mushrooms".</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking time is very short, 
  so use nothing tougher than shoulder and slice it quite thin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Toasted Sesame / Sesame Salt:</h3> &nbsp; These 
  are so important an ingredient you should always have plenty on hand if 
  you do any Korean or Japanese cooking. It's just white Sesame Seeds 
  dry pan roasted until light golden in color. The Sesame Salt is 
  these same toasted seeds pounded with some salt. For details see our 
  recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Sesame Salt</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Use narrow unwaxed 
  cucumbers that need not be peeled or seeded (Persian, European, Korean, 
  Japanese etc.).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Gochujang:</h3> &nbsp; This prepared chili paste 
  is an essential Korean ingredient and available in Korean markets. 
  It is not very hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_gochujz.html"><b>Gochujang Chili Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Wheat Noodles</h3> &nbsp; These should be Korean, 
  Chinese or Japanese wheat noodles, whatever size you prefer. For the 
  photo example I used wider Korean noodles, which stand up well to 
  mixing in the other ingredients.</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Red Chili</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses 
  red ripe Fresnos, but other red chilis will work fine. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Egg Strips:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very popular 
  Korean garnish, and easily made. See our recipe 
  <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip Garnish</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Mixing &amp; Serving:</h3> &nbsp; You will need a 
  good pair of tongs for this. The noodles will tend to clump and the 
  other ingredients will fall to the bottom. You can only control this 
  with tongs. <b>IF</b> you are a skilled pasta cook, take note that 
  Asian noodles are made of a very different flour and will behave 
  differently. They are more gelatinous, and they are done when there 
  is no chalky taste in the center.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comment:</h3> &nbsp; Many Asians like foods 
  rather sweet - I don't, and nor should you. I have cut the sugar in 
  the marinade by 1/3, and have cut the sugar in the sauce drastically, 
  from 2 T to 1/2 T. Feel free to adjust to your taste.</li>
