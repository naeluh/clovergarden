This lightly glazed deep fried pork dish offers an interesting blend of 
flavors. The deep fry step is a little messy due to the cornstarch, but 
it can be done well ahead so you can have plenty of time to clean up.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min &nbsp; + 2 to 3 hrs marinade)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/2 inch thick, and cut into strips 
    about 1/2 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long, or whatever size works 
    with your piece of pork (but not too small).</li>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER</b> on the "nail hole" side of your grater, and 
    wring out the juice in a square of muslin or similar.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>. Massage into <b>Pork</b> and set 
    aside to marinate for 2 hrs at room temperature, at least 3 hours 
    in the fridge, turning a couple times.</li> 
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLION</b> into about 1-1/2 inch lengths, white and green.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Cap and core <b>CHILIS</b>, and slice into 
    narrow strips. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Malt Liquid</b> and <b>Black Pepper</b>. 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Remove <b>Pork</b> from the marinade, drain briefly.</li> 
  <li>In a wok or suitable pan, heat <b>Oil</b> for deep fry very hot. 
    Doing batches of 5 to 7 pieces (depending on how much oil you have 
    heated), lightly dust each piece of pork in <b>Cornstarch</b>, then 
    fry in the hot oil for about 1 minute. There should be no more than 
    a trace of browning. Remove and drain on paper towels (the outside 
    will be quite stiff now). You can pause for clean-up here.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1-1/2 T of oil over 
    moderate heat. Stir in the <b>Garlic mix</b> for about 1 minute, 
    then stir in <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring another 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallions</b> and <b>Soy Sauce mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    1 minute more.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Sesame Oil</b> over and transfer to a serving dish. 
    Serve hot with plenty of steamed rice (medium grain).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses red ripe Fresno 
  chilis, but other medium hot chilis will work. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil, Deep Fry:</h3>> &nbsp; You don't need a lot, since the pork is 
  fried a few modest size piece at a time. Select a durable high 
  temperature oil such as Olive Pomace. If you use such an oil you can 
  easily recover it for further use by filtering through a paper towel 
  in a strainer. For details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html">
  <b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Malt Syrup:</h3> &nbsp; this syrup is easily available in Korean 
  markets, both clear and amber (amber preferred). It has the same 
  consistency as honey, but is about 1/3 as sweet. The most commonly 
  recommended substitute is Corn Syrup. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sw_maltsz.html"><b>Malt Syrup</b></a> page. You 
  could also use <a href="../ingred/sw_ricesz.html"><b>Rice Syrup</b></a> 
  which has a bit deeper flavor than the amber.</li>
