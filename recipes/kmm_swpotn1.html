<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> 
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: make <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip 
    Garnish</b></a>. Refrigerate. &nbsp; - (10 min)</li>
  <li>If not on hand, prepare <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
    Seeds</b></a>. &nbsp;- (10 min)</li>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b> and remove stems.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 35 min work)
  <ol Start="4">
  <li>Slice <b>MEAT</b> thin and into strips about 3/8 inch wide max, and 
    about 2 inches long. Beef across the grain, Pork and Chicken with the 
    grain.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Meat</b>. Set aside 
    for at least 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>SHIITAKES</b> and <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in warm water for about  
    45 minutes. This will change the texture of the Shiitakes from tough to 
    silky. The Black Fungus will expand greatly, but remain crunchy.</li>
  <li>Remove Stems from <b>Shiitakes</b> and slice thin. Remove hard attachment 
    points from <b>Black Fungus</b> and break or cut into moderate size pieces. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a boil. Add <b>SWEET POTATO NOODLES</b> 
    and cook until they are no longer stiff in the center (10 to 15 minutes). 
    They should still be a bit firm and very slippery. Drain and cool with cold 
    water. Drain well.</li>
  <li>Stretch out <b>Noodles</b> on you cutting board and cut into 4 to 5 inch 
    lengths.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, place <b>Noodles</b> and stir in all <b>Noodles Mix</b> 
    items. Mix well.</li>
  <li>Place sliced <b>Mushrooms</b> in a small bowl. Recover a Tablespoon of 
    the Noodle Marinade and stir it into the Shiitakes.</li>
  <li>Tear large <b>Spinach Leaves</b> into pieces about 2 x 3 inches.</li>
  <li>Bring some <b>Water</b> to a boil. Stir in the <b>Spinach Leaves</b> 
    for no more than 10 seconds. Refresh under cold water and squeeze out 
    excess water. Crush 1 cl <b>Garlic</b> and chop fine. Mix all 
    <b>Spinach Mix</b> items with Spinach. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise about 1/8 inch 
    thick. Set aside.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>Carrots</b> and cut into narrow juliennes about 2 inches long. 
    I use a julienning vegetable peeler. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>BELL PEPPER</b>. Slice 4 ounces into narrow strips about 
    2 inches long. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut thick ends of <b>SCALLIONS</b> in half lengthwise, then cut whole 
    Scallions diagonally into 2 inch lengths. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Intermission</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="18">
  <li>Clean-up and put kitchen back in order</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="19">
  <li>Set out a <b>Large Mixing Bowl</b>. Everything will go into it the 
    moment it is cooked.</li>
  <li>Have <b>all ingredients</b> on the list measured, prepared, and ready 
    to cook. Arrange them in order they appear in the steps below. This will 
    go with no time to spare.</li>
  <li>Scatter <b>Spinach mix</b> into the bottom of the Mixing Bowl, pulling 
    the leaves apart as best you can.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1/2 T <b>Oil</b> over medium 
    heat to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring 
    until translucent but still fairly crisp. Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and fry stirring until 
    just crisp tender. Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Bell Pepper</b> and fry stirring 
    until just crisp tender. Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Scallions</b> and fry stirring 
    until just crisp tender. Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Mushroom mix</b> with any marinade 
    and fry stirring for about 2 minutes. Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Meat</b> with any marinade and fry 
    stirring until all raw color is gone and any exuded liquid has evaporated, 
    (about 4 minutes). Scoop out into the Mixing Bowl.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> if needed. Stir in <b>Noodles</b> with their marinade 
    and fry tossing about for about 3 minutes or until hot and any liquid 
    has been absorbed.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Salt</b> and all <b>Finish items</b> to the Mixing Bowl. Toss 
    everything together to mix evenly. Use Tongs if it's too hot to handle.
    </li>
  <li>Serve as desired, see <a href="kmm_swpotn1.html#09"><b>Serving</b></a>. This recipe 
    can be reheated in a covered saut&eacute; pan or similar, with just 
    a little bit of water, but a certain amount of the carefully created 
    textural contrast will be lost.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; While Beef is most used in Korea, Pork, and Chicken 
  are also used. Any of these should be skinless, boneless, and with excess 
  fat removed. Chicken should be Leg or Thigh meat for best flavor and 
  texture. The photo example was made with Beef.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mirin:</h3> &nbsp; [Mirim (Korea)] &nbsp; This is a very sweet Sake. 
  Traditional is nearly unobtainable, but you can make the next best in 5 
  minutes by our recipe <a href="jig_mirinf1.html"><b>Mirin - 
  Non-Traditional</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shiitake Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; If you cannot find these, you can use 
  dried "Black Mushrooms", soaked for at least 1-1/2 hours.  
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; [Wood Ear, Tree Ear, etc.] This is a commonly 
  available item in most Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sweet Potato Noodles</h3> &nbsp; [Dangmyeon (Korea)] &nbsp; These are 
  available in pretty much all Korean markets and some general Asian markets. 
  They are "Glass Noodles", but thicker and far more durable than the common 
  Mung Bean noodles. These excellent noodles also pose some challenges. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/pa_swpotz.html"><b>Sweet Potato 
  Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Egg Strips:</h3> &nbsp; This is a popular garnish for fancy dishes 
  in Korea. It is easy to make using Egg Yolks (recommended). See our 
  recipe <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip Garnish</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are an essential pantry 
  staple for East and Southeast Asian cooking. If you don't have them, just 
  dry pan roast white sesame seeds, stirring and shaking, until they are a 
  medium blonde color. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Making:</h3> &nbsp; Note that the ingredients are all held separately 
  after prep, and cooked separately. This may seem a hassle, but, according 
  to cooks with plenty of experience with this dish, it's the only way to 
  assure a good, or even acceptable Japchae. Keep in mind, this is a 
  "show off" celebration dish, not a weekday supper, so the effort is 
  fully justified.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Korea, this dish is most often served cold as 
  a banchan (small side dish), but can also be served warm as a main dish, 
  or at room temperature on a buffet. When it is served warm over a bed of 
  rice it is Japchae-bap. Rice should be medium grain Korean / Japanese / 
  California type. My favorite is Kukuho Rose from California.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Japchae</h3> &nbsp; The name means "mixed vegetables". At its origin 
  in the 17th century CE, when presented in the royal court, it included 
  only vegetables, mushrooms, and seasonings. As it became popular outside 
  the court, meats were added, and in the late 20th century, sweet potato 
  noodles, adopted from China, became an almost essential ingredient. 
  Today, Japchaes are made featuring bean sprouts, seafood, peppers, herbs, 
  etc. with or without noodles.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Vegetarian:</h3> &nbsp; All you have to do is omit the Meat, or 
  replace it. This can be with Deep Fired Tofu, Pressed Tofu, Pressed and 
  Seasoned Tofu, or, if there is no Celiac risk, Wheat Gluten.</li>
