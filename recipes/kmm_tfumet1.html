<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 8 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Anchovy Stock</b> if you don't have it (or another suitable 
    Stock) on hand (see <a href="kmm_tfumet1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).
    </li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol Start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>MEAT</b> Into small pieces, less than 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for at least 1-1/2 hours. 
    Drain and cut into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Paste items</b> until Chili Flake has absorbed all the 
    Sesame Oil. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> small.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small</li>
  <li>For Garnish, slice <b>SCALLION GREENS</b> crosswise about 1/4 inch.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Oil</b>. A 3-1/2 
    quart will give you plenty of real estate for handling the Eggs. Stir in 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until Translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b>, then <b>Meat</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b>. Fry 
    stirring until meat takes a little color, then stir in <b>Stock</b>. 
    Simmer covered until Meat is cooked, about 10 to 20 minutes depending 
    on type of meat and how it is cut.</li>
  <li>Uncover and bring to a boil. <b><u>IF</u></b> using Soft Tofu, cut the 
    tubes in half and squeeze into the Stew. <b><u>IF</u></b> using Silken 
    Tofu, scoop it out in large chunks. Once it is in, break it up evenly 
    into medium bite size pieces with a wooden spatula.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Paste mix</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>. When it comes back to 
    a simmer, cover and hold there for about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Eggs</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min)
  <ol start="13">
  <li>When ready to Serve: &nbsp; with the stew bubbling, crack as many 
    <b>EGGS</b> as there will be servings (1 to 4) onto the stew. It will 
    help to crack them into small shallow bowls first to make sure the 
    yolks stay intact. Let cook 2 minutes. Without disturbing the eggs, 
    spoon stew into individual serving bowls. Scoop up an <b>Egg</b> and 
    place it into each bowl. The Yolks should still be liquid.</li>
  <li> Serve immediately, garnished with <b>Scallion Greens</b>. 
    Accompany with Steamed Medium Grain (California) Rice (see 
    <a href="kmm_tfumet1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be made with Chicken, Pork, or Beef. 
  Any of these should be skinless, boneless, and with excess fat removed. 
  Chicken should be Leg or Thigh meat for best flavor and texture. The 
  photo example was made with Chicken.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Soft Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; This is a specialty of Korea, packed in 11 ounce 
  sausage tubes. the same amount of Silken Tofu could also be used. for details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the dried Shiitakes available 
  just about everywhere. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; [Gochu-garu] &nbsp; This should be Korean 
  chili flake, which is (usually) not excessively hot. You can vary the 
  amount to your preference, but I suggest not going below 2 Tablespoons. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer our <a href="kof_ancho2.html"><b>Anchovy 
  Vegetable Stock</b></a>, but Chicken Stock or other low salt stocks could 
  be used. The pattern recipe called for Anchovy Kelp Stock </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; With an egg, this recipe will easily serve 3. With 
  a bowl of rice to be spooned in as desired, it will stretch to 4 with or 
  without egg. If serving with rice, make it a bit more liquid.</li>
