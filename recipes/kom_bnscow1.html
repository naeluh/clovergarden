A quick and simple soup, one of many Korean bean sprout soups. This 
recipe is based on one published in Korea in 1974, but I've increased 
the beef from 4 ounces to 6. This soup is served with rice 
(medium grain).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp;  These are the common  mung bean sprouts. 
  In a Korean household, the thread-like roots would always be pinched 
  off, which is rather tedious (45 minutes for this recipe) - but that's 
  what kids are for. We barbarians are free to ignore this requirement 
  (unless we have Korean guests).</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The Koreans have two kinds of soy sauce, 
  regular (Gan-Jang), similar to Japanese, and Soy Sauce for Soup 
  (Guk-Gan-Jang), which is saltier and lighter in color. Soy Sauce for 
  Soup would be used for this recipe in Korea. Korean cooking maven 
  Maangchi recommends Thai fish sauce to maintain the light color if 
  you don't have Soy Sauce for Soup. A bit less regular Kikoman and a 
  touch of salt could also work. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_soysz.html"><b>Soy Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sesame Salt:</h3> &nbsp; This important seasoning is just white 
  Sesame Seeds dry pan roasted until light golden in color, then cooled 
  and crushed with Salt. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Sesame Salt</b></a>.</li>
