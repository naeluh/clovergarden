A quick and simple soup but surprisingly robust and flavorful with a 
distinctly Korean character. Wter packed fernbrake is easiest, but 
dried can be used, see <a href="kom_cowfern1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>. See 
<a href="kom_cowfern1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for variation.

    <ol>
  <li><b><u>IF</u></b> using dried <b>FERNBRAKE</b> see our 
    <a href="../ingred/fn_fernbrz.html"><b>Fernbrake</b></a> page.  
    Water packed Fernbrake needs no prep.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 40 minutes work, mostly 
    for cutting beef) 
  <ol start=2>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into strips about 
    1/4 inch wide by 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> 
    and massage into <b>Beef</b>. Let marinade for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Fernbrake</b>. Trim water packed fronds 9 inches long to 
    remove hard fibrous ends (dried are usually shorter). Cut into 1-1/2 
    inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally starting 1/2" at the white end 
    going to 1" in the green end.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>SOY SPROUTS</b> - and see <a href="kom_cowfern1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.
    </li></ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Place <b>Beef</b> and <b>Marinade</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; 
    pan. Fry stirring over moderate heat until all liquid has evaporated 
    and the Beef is frying - but not long enough to burn the chili powder.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Water</b>, cover tightly and simmer covered for 
     about 20 minutes or until beef is nearly tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fernbrake</b>, <b>Soy Sprouts</b> (if regular  bean 
    sprouts - see <a href="kom_cowfern1.html#03"><b>Note-4</b></a>), <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.  Bring back to a simmer and let simmer for about 15 
    min more.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallions</b>, give it another minute of simmer, then 
    serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sesame Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use the dark Japanese kind. Frying 
  temperatures will be low enough it won't be harmed starting with 
  it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Korean Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This powder, available in any 
  market that serves a Korean community, is flavorful and only moderately 
  hot. The amount given will not be excessively hot by Southern 
  California standards, but use your own best judgement. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03"><h3>Fernbrake:</h3> &nbsp; [Bracken Fern] &nbsp; Weight is 
  for water packed fronds, or fully soaked dried Fernbrake. Both dried 
  and water packed (refrigerated) can be found in most Korean markets. 
  Dried will need a 30 minute boil, rinsing, and an 8 hour soak in 
  changes of water. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fn_fernbrz.html"><b>Bracken Fern</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Soy Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use soy sprouts. If all 
  you have is regular mung bean sprouts, put them in just for the last 
  5 minutes or so. The flavor and texture will be less robust but 
  acceptable. Please note that no Korean cook would add bean sprouts 
  to a recipe without all the thread-like roots removed - but they 
  have obedient children to pinch them off. Yours would probably call 
  Children's Services if you insisted they do this job. Taking the 
  roots off soybeans for this recipe takes about 20 minutes - but don't 
  despair - Korean children here have been learning disobedience too. 
  Some Korean markets now stock soy sprouts with the roots cut off at 
  the factory, hopefully without violating child labor laws. Of course, 
  we Barbarians are free to ignore this requirement entirely.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variation:</h3> &nbsp; This soup can easily accommodate some bean 
  starch noodles for a little more substance. Soak them, then boil them 
  separately until done - this may be as little as 3 minutes depending 
  on chosen size. Drain. I usually make two or three cuts through the 
  batch to make them more manageable. Add to the soup with the 
  scallions.</li>
