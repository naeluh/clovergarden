A substantial, flavorful soup, good for colder weather. It has good 
Korean character and is not real spicy by Southern California standards. 
We have a simpler version with bracken fern at

<p>Yes, 11 cups is a lot of soup, because I sized it to use a whole 1 
pound package of Royal Fern. Feel free to make a half recipe.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut into soup sized 
    pieces.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>ROYAL FERN</b>, rinse and cut into pieces about 1-1/2 
    inches long.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix all <b>Flavorings items</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally starting 1/2" at the white end 
    going to 1" in the green end.</li>
  <li>For Garnish, slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> very thin crosswise.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a coverable wok or large pot heat <b>Sesame Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Beef</b> over high heat until ligtly browned all over.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Flavorings mix</b>, <b>Royal Fern</b>, <b>Onion</b>,  
    <b>Beef Broth</b> and enough <b>Water</b> to make it look like 
    soup. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer until Beef is 
    tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Bring some salted water to a boil and cook 
    <b>Starch Noodles</b> until just done. This may take as little as 
    3 minutes depending on size. Drain. I usually lay the bundle out 
    on the cutting board and make two cuts through it so the noodles 
    are more manageable. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bean Sprouts</b>, <b>Noodles</b> and <b>Scallions</b>. 
    Simmer another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Scallions</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck is a good choice for this recipe. Weight 
  is boneless with all excess fat removed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Royal Fern</h3> &nbsp; This will be immature fern fronds, boiled 
  and vacuum packed with water in clear plastic bags. They can be found 
  in the refrigerated section of well stocked Korean markets, as they 
  are a popular vegetable in Korea. If unavailable the smaller Bracken 
  Ferns could be used. For details see our <a href="../ingred/fern.html">
  <b>Ferns</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Korean Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This powder available in any 
  market that serves a Korean community, is flavorful and only moderately 
  hot. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Paste:</h3> [Gochujang] This is a dark red, fermented paste 
  available in <u>all</u> Korean markets in jars and plastic tubs. It 
  may be made with chilis and rice flour or with chilis and wheat flour. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_gochujz.html">
  <b>Gochujang</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
<h3>Soy Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use soy sprouts. If all you have 
  is regular mung bean sprouts, put them in just for the last 5 minutes 
  or so. The flavor and texture will be less robust but acceptable. 
  Please note that no Korean cook would add bean sprouts to a recipe 
  without all the threadlike roots removed - but they have obedient 
  children to pinch them off. Yours would probably call Children's 
  Services if you insisted they do this job. Taking the roots off 
  soybeans for this recipe takes about 15 minutes - but don't dispair - 
  Korean children here have been learning disobedience too. Some Korean 
  markets now stock soy sprouts with the roots cut off at the factory, 
  hopefully without violating child labor laws.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sesame Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use the dark Japanese kind. Korea is the 
  only country that does much frying in dark sesame oil.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Starch Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These can be the common mung bean 
  starch noodles known as "celophane noodles" and under various other 
  names. Sweet potato starch noodles may also be used, but those can be 
  found only in Asian markets. Use whatever size you like.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Sometimes small cubes of Tofu are stirred in 
  along with the Bean Sprouts.</li>
