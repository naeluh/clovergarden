<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li><b>If you want to:</b> &nbsp; Pinch tails off of Soy Sprouts 
    (see <a href="kom_cowrad1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol Start="2">
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> less than 1/4 inch thick, across the grain, then 
    into pieces roughly 1 inch square. This is easiest if you give it 40 
    minutes in the freezer compartment to stiffen.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>RADISH</b> about 1/4 inch thick, then into pieces about 3/4 
    inch square.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut into pieces similar 
    to the Radish.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally about 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Sesame Oil</b>. Fry <b>Beef</b> 
    over moderately high heat until it has completely lost its raw color and 
    any exuded liquid has evaporated. Don't overheat the Sesame Oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Radish</b> for about 2 minutes, then stir in <b>Chili 
    Flake</b> until everything is well coated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b>, <b>Soybean Sprouts</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b>, and 
    5 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 15 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallions</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b>, and <b>Salt</b>. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer about 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Steamed Medium Grain (California) Rice (see 
    <a href="kom_cowrad1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. Cooking 
  time is short, so select a tender cut, definitely no tougher than 
  Chuck.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably this will be a plump Korean Radish, 
  but a Daikon will do.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably these will be King Trumpet 
  Oyster Mushrooms, but regular White Mushrooms will work. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster 
  Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; [Gochugaru] &nbsp; This should be Korean chili 
  flake, which is not excessively hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome, and used to a lesser 
  extent in Korea and China. If you are unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Koreans have been offended by 
  the sight of thread-like roots on their bean sprouts, so they have pinched 
  them off. There is now a trend to not pinch them off because there are 
  important nutrients in the roots (and it takes an absurd amount of time). 
  When using this soup for a hangover cure, definitely leave the roots on 
  for the special nutrients within, which are said to also aid brain 
  developent in children. For jobs like pinching roots is what the Koreans 
  have eager and obedient children for - a resource in short supply here in 
  North America. On the other hand, Korean markets sometimes have packages 
  of soy sprouts with the tails cut off at the factory.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Serve this soup in individual bowls. Have on the 
  table a bowl of steamed Medium Grain Rice that folks can spoon into the soup 
  in the amount they desire.</li>
