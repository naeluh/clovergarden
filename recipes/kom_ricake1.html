  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (varies)
  <ol>
  <li>Thaw and/or soak <b>RICE CAKES</b> as needed - for details see our 
    <a href="../ingred/pa_riccz.html"><b>Rice Cakes</b></a> page.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using:  Make <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html"><b>Egg Strip 
    Garnish</b></a></li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>If <b>Rice Cakes</b> are sticks, slice thin into disks or ovals.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> thin and cut into very narrow strips 1 to 1-1/2 
    inch long.</li>
  <li>In a small saucepan, add <b>Beef</b> and water to cover well. Place 
    over high heat, and when it comes to a boil, strain out Beef and rinse 
    well. This is to keep your soup clear.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1 inch lengths, or <b>DAEPA</b> about 1/2 
    Inch.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In sauce pan large enough for the recipe, pour in <b>Beef Broth</b> and 
    stir in <b>Beef</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer 
    for about 45 minutes or until Beef is tender.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice Cake</b> and bring back to a simmer. Simmer covered 
    another 10 minutes until the slices are softened and start to float. 
    Beyond 5 minutes they won't get much more tender, but they will start 
    thickening the soup, so basically, simmer as long as you think gives 
    you the desired thickness. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, then <b>Scallions / Daepa</b> 
    simmer another 2 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Kimchi on the side (if desired).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Cakes:</h3> &nbsp;  Preferably, these will be fresh cylinders 
  from a Korean or other Asian market, but semi-dry can be used. 
  For details of cooking the various forms, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_riccz.html"><b>Rice Cakes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Scallions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "1/2 Daepa or 
  3 Scallions". Daepa, or Dae-pa are giant Scallions popular in China and 
  Korea. I happened to have them on hand, so that's what I used in the 
  photo example. For details see our <a href="../ingred/li_onion.html#scal">
  <b>Onions, Leeks, Shallots, Garlic, etc.</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Beef Broth / Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This is a simple soup, so much depends 
  on the quality and flavor of the Beef Broth or Stock. It should be fairly 
  clear.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Egg Strip Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very common garnish in Korea, 
  and very easy to make by our recipe <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html">
  <b>Egg Strip Garnish</b></a>. It can be made well ahead and refrigerated.
