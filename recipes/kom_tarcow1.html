A quick and simple soup, similar to a potato soup, but taro has a 
cleaner flavor and a creamy texture. This soup is served with rice 
(medium grain) and perhaps a banchan (small side dish) or two.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 25 min work) 
  <ol>
  <li>Boil plenty of <b>Water</b>. Stir in <b>TARO ROOTS</b> and 
    boil for 5 minutes. Drain and quench in cold water.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Taro</b>. This is not so easy because the hairy skin will 
    clog the peeler, and the taro gets real slippery as you peel it. Cut 
    into bite size pieces. Set aside</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/4 inch thick and cut 
    into squares about 5/8 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally into 1/4 inch long pieces.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a saucepan, bring 5 cups <b>Water</b> to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Beef</b>. Bring back to a boil and skim off the scum that 
    surfaces. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and simmer about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Taro</b>, <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Perilla Powder</b> into a very fine strainer and lower 
    it into the soup (the strainer works as a dispersal tool). Swish it 
    around with a wooden spoon for a minute, then lift it out, pressing 
    the remaining powder through the strainer. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallion</b>, simmer 1 minute more and take off 
    heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with rice (medium grain), and maybe a banchan (tiny 
    side dish) or two. I don't know how the Koreans do it, but I place 
    a bowl of rice on the table that can be spooned into the soup as 
    desired.</li>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Taro:</h3> &nbsp;  These "corms" can be found in markets serving 
  an Asian or Latin American community. For details

  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Soy Sauce for Soup:</h3> &nbsp; This Soy Sauce can be found in 
  Korean markets. Try to get the "naturally brewed" version. Thai Fish 
  Sauce is considered an acceptable substitute. For details see our

<li id="03">
  <h3>Perilla Seed Powder:</h3> &nbsp; [<i>deulkkae-garu</i>] This is 
  ground Perilla seeds. It is used as a thickener that also imparts a
