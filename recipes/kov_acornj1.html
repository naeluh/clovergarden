 The recipe will provide "single bowl meals" 
for 2 people, or soup courses for 4. It offers interestingly contrasting 
flavors and textures. In Korea this soup is also served cold, in which 
case cucumber strips may replace the egg strips (or you 
can have both).

<p>This soup is assembled into individual servings, so is not good for 
buffet service.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min &nbsp;  50 min with Stock) 
  <ol>
  <li>Bring out any refrigerated ingredients to let them warm 
    to room temperature as you work. Time your rice to be just 
    finished at serving time so it goes into the bowls hot.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>ACORN JELLY</b> into sticks about 3/8 inch on a side and 
    a length that will fit in your bowls.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>KIMCHEE</b> fairly small. Mix with <b>Sugar</b> and 
    <b>Toasted Sesame</b>. Set aside to marinate.</li>
  <li>Make <b>EGG STRIPS</b> if not on hand.</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>CHILI</b>. Cut into narrow strips.</li>
  <li>Crush or cut <b>NORI</b> into small fragments.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLION</b> thin crosswise, white and green.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Bring your <b>Stock</b> up to a simmer. Just before serving, 
    stir in all <b>for Broth</b> items.</li>
  <li>Set out <b>Bowls</b>. You will use 1/2 of each of the following 
    ingredients if using "One Bowl Meal" size bowls, or 1/4 of each if 
    using "Soup Course" size bowls. Assemble in this order (leaving 
    enough room for a good bit of stock). Please refer to 
    <a href="kov_acornj1.html#09">Note-9</a> on arrangement: 
    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Rice
    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Acorn Jelly sticks
    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Kimchee mix
    </li>
  <li>Pour <b>Hot Stock</b> into the bowls as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Decorate with all <b>Garnish items</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Acorn Jelly:</h3> &nbsp; This popular ingredient 
  is available in most Korean markets here in Los Angeles. It is often 
  made by the market. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ok_acornz.html"><b>Acorn Jelly</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This can be our 
  <a href="kov_mrdash1.html"><b>Mushroom Dashima Stock</b></a> for a 
  vegetarian, or either our 
  <a href="kof_ancho1.html"><b>Anchovy Stock</b></a> or our 
  <a href="kof_ancho2.html"><b>Anchovy stock with Vegetables</b></a>, 
  or a similar stock.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kimchee:</h3> &nbsp; This should be red Napa 
  Cabbage Kimchee, the most common sort. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ig_kimchee.html"><b>Kimchee Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are almost always 
  used. If you don't have them, just dry pan roast white sesame seeds, 
  stirring and shaking, until they are a medium blonde color. For details 
  see our <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame Seeds</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Nori</h3> &nbsp; [Gim (Korea)] This is paper like sheets of 
  seaweed, much used as a wrapper or garnish in Japanese and Korean 
  cuisine - available in just about any Asian market. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/algae.html"><b>Algae</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for a "green 
  chili", but our serranos are a lot hotter than Korean green chilis. 
  I choose instead to use a red Fresno chili, which will not be too hot 
  for my guests. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Egg Strip Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very popular garnish in 
  Korea, and very easy to make. It is a thin, one egg omelet, cut into 
  strips. Many recipes call for separate omelets from the yolk and white, 
  but I never do that, as egg whites don't photograph at all well. For 
  details see our recipe <a href="kid_eggstrp1.html">
  <b>Egg Strip Garnish</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The Koreans have two kinds of soy sauce, 
  regular (Gan-Jang), similar to Japanese, and Soy Sauce for Soup 
  (Guk-Gan-Jang), which is saltier and lighter in color. Soy Sauce for 
  Soup would be used for this recipe in Korea. Korean cooking maven 
  Maangchi recommends Thai fish sauce to maintain the light color if 
  you don't have Soy Sauce for Soup. A bit less regular Kikoman and 
  a touch of salt could also work. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_soysz.html"><b>Soy Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; When loading the bowls, please note: the Rice 
  and Acorn Jelly sticks are put down evenly. The Kimchee is placed all 
  off to one side. The Garnishes are similarly offset to other parts of 
  the bowl, particularly the Nori. This provides very different taste 
  sensations when spooning from different parts of the bowl.</li>
