<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Anchovies, Dried:</h3> &nbsp;  These should be the largest size of 
  dried anchovies, 2 to 4 inches long. They are available in any Korean 
  market, and many other Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_anchodz.html"><b>Dried Anchovies</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Kelp:</b> &nbsp; [Dashima (Korea); Konbu, Kombu 
  (Japan)] &nbsp; For details see our <a href="../ingred/al_konbuz.html">
  <b>Konbu / Kelp</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; [Gochugaru] &nbsp; This should be Korean chili 
  flake, which is not excessively hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_korjz.html"><b>Korean / Japanese Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome, and used to a lesser 
  extent in Korea and China. If you are unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Koreans have been offended by 
  the sight of thread-like roots on their bean sprouts, so they have pinched 
  them off. There is now a trend to not pinch them off because there are 
  important nutrients in the roots (and it takes an absurd amount of time). 
  When using this soup for a hangover cure, definitely leave the roots on 
  for the special nutrients within, which are said to also aid brain 
  development in children. For jobs like pinching roots is what the Koreans 
  have eager and obedient children for - a resource in short supply here in 
  North America. On the other hand, Korean markets sometimes have packages 
  of soy sprouts with the tails cut off at the factory.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Serve this soup in individual bowls. Have on the 
  table a bowl of steamed Medium Grain Rice that folks can spoon into the soup 
  in the amount they desire. You can also stir some Kimchi into the soup.</li>
