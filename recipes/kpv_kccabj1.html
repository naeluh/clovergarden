This all season kimchi is very easy to make. It can be served 
immediately with a dash of vinegar, or fermented 3 to 4 days. If you 
make it to serve immediately you can skip the rice porridge. I made a 
batch of this and forgot it for about two weeks. It was just fine.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5-1/2 hrs - 25 min work + 2 to 4 days fermenting)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove 4 large leaves from the <b>CABBAGE</b> and set aside. Cut 
    the cabbages crosswise into 1-1/2 inch thick disks.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>RADISH</b> crosswise into thin slices, then cut the slices 
    into squares about 1 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>In a non-reactive container make a brine by dissolving 2-1/2 oz of 
    <b>Sea Salt</b> in 5 cups of cool <b>Water</b>. Add the 
    <b>Cabbage</b>, <b>Radish</b> and reserved <b>Cabbage Leaves</b>. 
    Weight them down if needed to keep them submerged and soak for 4 to 
    5 hours. Then drain, rinse and drain again.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very 
    thin, then into threads, and cut the threads crosswise for very 
    tiny pieces. Mix both together with <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Chili 
    Flake</b>, <b>Chili Powder</b> and <b>Rice Porridge</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths using both white and 
    green.</li>
  <li>Mix together thoroughly but gently <b>Cabbage</b>, <b>Radish</b>, 
    <b>Chili mix</b> and <b>Scallions</b>. Pack into a glass or ceramic 
    container and top with the reserved <b>Cabbage Leaves</b>. I use a 
    squat wide mouth half gallon jar which this recipe 3/4 fills.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle 3/4 oz <b>Salt</b> on top. Cover and set aside in a cool 
    place to ferment for 2 to 4 days to mature flavor.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Napa Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; [Chinese Cabbage] 
  &nbsp; In Korea they would be using a long narrow Napa Cabbage, but 
  for this recipe the common blocky version will do fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Either Korean 
  (cylindrical) or Japanese (carrot shaped) will work fine, there 
  isn't much difference.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Only completely natural 
  sea salt should be used for making kimchi, as some of the trace 
  minerals are important to the fermentation process. American sea salt 
  may have come from the sea, but has been heavily refined and may 
  have additives, so is unsuitable. Buy your sea salt from a Korean 
  market where it is sold in various size plastic bags for a reasonable 
  price.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A Thai Fish Sauce will work fine. My 
  favorites are Megachef and Squid brand. The often recommended Three 
  Crabs includes fructose, MSG (disguised), and is "processed in Hong 
  Kong", whatever that means.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Porridge:</h3> &nbsp; A very simple, quick and easy to make 
  Rice Porridge can be used in Kimchi recipes. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="kig_riceprg1.html"><b>Rice Porridge, Quick</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Flake / Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This 
  <u>MUST</u> be genuine Korean Chili Flake and Powder, or the hotness 
  will be all wrong. Korean flake is relatively mild, but not what 
  someone from the Frozen North might consider "mild" For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
