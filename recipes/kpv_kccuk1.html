This easy to make, refreshing Kimchee is popular during the Summer. It 
can be eaten right after it is made, with a dash of rice vinegar, and 
perhaps a pinch of sugar, or it can be fermented for 2 to 3 days. I 
recomend the full 3 days ferment.

<p>This recipe makes 4 pounds, 2 pounds 4 ounces drained weight. With 
liquid, it will fill a 1/2 gallon fermenting jar.</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>Cucumbers</b> less than 1/8 inch thick. A mandolin or 
    similar slicer is good for this.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKON</b> and cut into very thin juliennes (I use a 
    julienning vegetable peeler) cut to about 1-1/2 inches long.
    </li>
  <li>Shred <b>CABBAGE</b> thin in lengths of about 1-1/2 inch long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch long pieces, white and green.
    </li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>CHILIS</b>. Slice into fine threads about 1 inch 
    long.</li>
  <li>IF Using: scrape <b>CARROT</b> and cut into fine juliennes. Again, a 
    julienning vegetable peeler is the best way.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Vegetable items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    crosswise, then into threads and finally cut the threads crosswise 
    fine. Mix and pound to a smooth paste in a mortar.</li>
  <li>Combine <b>Garlic mix</b> with all other <b>Dressing items</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Pour <b>Dressing</b> over <b>Vegetable mix</b> and tumble 
    well to coat evenly. It will seem not very juicy and rather salty 
    at first, but as the salt leaches liquid from the vegetables it will 
    get juicy. Tumble a couple of times to help it along.</li>
  <li>This Kimchee can be chilled and served after an hours rest time. 
    (dress with a dash of rice vinegar and possibly a pinch of sugar), 
    or it can be set in a cool place to ferment for 2 to 3 days, then 
    refrigerate. In any case, it should be consumed within a week.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Use narrow unwaxed 
  cucumbers that need not be peeled or seeded (Persian, European, Korean, 
  Japanese etc.).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Either Korean 
  (cylindrical) or Japanese (carrot shaped) will work fine, there 
  isn't much difference.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Carrot:</h3> &nbsp; This type of kimchee existed 
  before the carrot was introduced to Korea, but is often included, as 
  some people consider it to enhance the flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Porridge:</h3> &nbsp; A very simple, quick 
  and easy to make Rice Porridge can be used in Kimchee recipes. For 
  details see our recipe <a href="kig_riceprg1.html"><b>Rice Porridge, 
  Quick</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Only completely natural 
  sea salt is acceptable for making kimchee, as some of the trace 
  minerals are very important to the fermentation process. American 
  sea salt may have come from the sea, but has been heavily processed 
  and is unsuitable. Buy your sea salt from a Korean market where it 
  is sold in various size plastic bags for a reasonable price.</li>
