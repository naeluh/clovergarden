This summer kimchee is light and cool and isn't nearly as chili hot as 
you might think. Korean flake is fairly mild. This kimchee can be chilled 
and served immediately, or kept refrigerated for a week or so.

<p>This recipe doesn't really qualify as "kimchi" because it's not 
fermented, but it's made so similarly that Koreans call it "kimchi".</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut tips from <b>Cucumbers</b>, quarter lengthwise and cut into 
    1-1/2 inch lengths. Tumble with <b>Sea Salt</b> and set aside for 
    40 minutes, tumbling now and then. Drain <u>reserving the liquid</u> 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKON</b> and cut into very thin juliennes (I use a 
    julienning vegetable peeler) cut to about 1-1/2 inches long.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin crosswise, white and green. Mix with 
    Daikon.</li>
  <li>Scrape <b>CARROT</b> and cut into fine juliennes. Again, a 
    julienning vegetable peeler is the best way. Mix with Daikon.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Vegetable items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    crosswise, then into threads and finally cut the threads crosswise 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Combine all <b>Dressing Items</b> with reserved <b>Cucumber 
    liquid</b>.</li>
  <li>Combine <b>Vegetable mix</b> with <b>Cucumbers</b>. Pour 
    <b>Dressing</b> over and tumble well to coat evenly.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate. This Kimchee can be chilled and served immediately. 
    It is not fermented, but can be held in the fridge several days
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Use narrow unwaxed 
  cucumbers that need not be peeled or seeded (Persian, European, Korean, 
  Japanese etc.).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Since this kimchee is not fermented, it is 
  not so important to use natural Korean sea salt, but it's better.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Either Korean 
  (cylindrical) or Japanese (carrot shaped) will work fine, there 
  isn't much difference.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Rice Porridge:</h3> &nbsp; A very simple, quick 
  and easy to make Rice Porridge can be used in Kimchee recipes. For 
  details see our recipe <a href="kig_riceprg1.html"><b>Rice Porridge, 
  Quick</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A Thai Fish Sauce will 
  work fine. My favorites are Megachef and Squid brands. The often 
  recommended Three Crabs includes fructose, MSG (disguised), and is 
  "processed in Hong Kong", whatever that means.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This <u>MUST</u> be 
  genuine Korean Chili Flake, or the hotness will be all wrong. Korean 
  flake is relatively mild, though not what some people from the Frozen 
  North might consider "mild".</li>
