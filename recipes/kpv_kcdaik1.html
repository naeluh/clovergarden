This winter kimchee is very easy to make, and popular enough our local 
Korean markets usually have it in the refrigerated cases. It can be 
served immediately with a dash of vinegar, or fermented 3 to 4 days. 
Makes 2-1/2 pounds, drained weight 1-1/2 pounds.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Either Korean 
  (cylindrical) or Japanese (carrot shaped) will work fine, there 
  isn't much difference.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Only completely natural 
  sea salt should be used for making kimchee, as some of the trace 
  minerals are important to the fermentation process. American sea salt 
  may have come from the sea, but has been heavily refined and may 
  have additives, so is unsuitable. Buy your sea salt from a Korean 
  market where it is sold in various size plastic bags for a reasonable 
  price.</li>
