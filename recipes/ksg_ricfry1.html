Korean fried rice is different from Chinese in a number of respects, and 
some recipes may be more complex, but the theory and usage are the same. 
Fried rice is not served with meals. It is a light lunch and snack food, 
often made by street vendors.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>RICE</b> well ahead, preferably the previous day and 
    refrigerated overnight.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK MUSHROOMS</b> in cool water for at least 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Dipping Sauce</b> (<a href="ksg_ricfry1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> - 
    10 min)</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min) 
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Wring excess water out of <b>Mushrooms</b>. Remove stems, and cut 
    into 1/4 inch squares.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATO</b> and cut into 1/4 inch dice. Hold in cool water 
    until needed. </li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ZUCCHINI</b> into 1/4 inch dice. Cut <b>ONION</b> into 
    1/4 inch dice. Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1/2 inch lengths. Mix all 
    with diced <b>Mushrooms</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b>. Mix with <b>Carrots</b>.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> over 
    fairly high heat. Stir in <b>Potato mix</b> and fry stirring until 
    almost cooked through, about 8 minutes. If you wish, you can add 
    some water and steam them so they cook faster, just evaporate the 
    water before the next step.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Zucchini mix</b>, along with 1/4 t <b>Salt</b> and 
    1/8 t <b>Pepper</b>. Fry stirring until barely cooked, about 3 
    minutes. These vegetables should still have plenty of crunch. 
    Remove from the pan and set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Fluff <b>Rice</b> well, separating the grains as best you can.</li>
  <li>Add 2 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and heat it well over fairly high 
    flame. Stir in <b>Rice</b>, along with 2/3 t <b>Salt</b> and 1/4 t 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Fry stirring and breaking up any lumps for about 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Vegetables</b> back into the pan and fry stirring for 
    about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, with some <b>Dipping Sauce</b> drizzled over.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; 1 pound is 3 to 3-1/2 cups 
  loosely packed. 1 cup raw Jasmine rice makes about 1 pound. Long grain 
  rice is best, and it should be cooked fairly firm so the grains are 
  quite separate. Preferably it should have been refrigerated overnight 
  - the colder the better - this changes its starch composition.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; These are the same 
  dried Shiitakes found in every Asian market and many supermarkets.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, which 
  stand up well to stir frying. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media in most of 
  Asia is Lard, and it is used in Korea. If you use it, you will have a 
  lot <u>less trouble with rice sticking</u> to the pan. Lard has a 
  health profile better than butter, and is far and away better for you 
  than the trans fats and denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has told you to 
  use. Do render your own lard though, it's easy. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Soy Scallion Dipping Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a popular Korean 
  dipping and topping sauce for fried foods. It is easy to make by our 
  recipe <a href="kjv_soysc1.html"><b>Soy Scallion Dipping 
  Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very simple 
  home style recipe, which will use rice cooked the day before. All 
  ingredients given here are fresh, and the recipe is vegetarian, but in 
  the home it might be made partially or entirely from left over 
  vegetables and meats (with cooking times adjusted to suit). As you 
  might expect, ingredients vary widely. The vegetable mix should be 
  brightly colored, red and green bell peppers are often used for color. 
  recipes may include some chopped kimchee.
  <br>One thing that seems fairly standard, is that all the ingredients 
  are cut into dice between 1/4 and 3/8 inch on a side. Korean fried 
  rice recipes can be a lot more complex, and are often topped with an 
  egg, fried sunny side up, or with strips of omelet, but the egg is not 
  stirred in raw as it often is in China.
  <br>While this recipe presents the rice very white, Many recipes stir 
  in some Oyster Sauce and/or Soy Sauce near the end of cooking for 
  various darker shades.</li>
