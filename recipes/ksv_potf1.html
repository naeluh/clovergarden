This side dish is more substantial than Banchan (small side dishes) and 
can be served with rice for lunch or used as a Western side dish or 
snack. It is easier to make and has fewer calories than conventional 
fried potatoes.

<p><u>Note</u>: I have cut the sugar to 1/3 the amount in the pattern

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in plenty 
    of cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise, then crosswise, about 
    1/2 inch wide.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> well.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> moderately 
    hot and stir in <b>Potatoes</b>. Fry stirring for a couple of 
    minutes. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and continue to fry stirring until 
    Garlic threatens to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion</b>. Continue to fry stirring for a couple 
    of minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in 2/3 c <b>Water</b>, <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. 
    Cook covered over moderate heat, stirring now and then, until 
    Potatoes are just tender all the way through and all liquid has 
    evaporated. During cooking, stir in more water as needed if Potatoes 
    aren't done yet. Test the Potatoes often to get them just right, and 
    don't overstir.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat. Stir in <b>Sesame Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with toasted 
    <b>Sesame Seeds</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, which 
  hold up well to this sort of cooking. Red potatoes could also be 
  used but are a bit more delicate. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; Toasted sesame seeds are almost always 
  used. If you don't have them, just dry pan roast white sesame seeds, 
  stirring and shaking, until they are a medium blonde color. For details 
  see our recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
  Seeds</b></a>.</li>
