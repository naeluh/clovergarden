Spinach is popular in Korea, often used to make namul (seasoned vegetable) 
for use as a Banchan (small side dish). The recipe makes enough for about 10 
banchans, or sides for 3 to 4 (see <a href="ksv_spin1.html#04"><b>Yield</b></a>).

  <li>Cut roots from <b>SPINACH</b> and float wash. Remove substandard 
    leaves. Break off stems, but retain them for the recipe. Drain both 
    well - I use a salad spinner. The Spinach can now be loosely bagged 
    in plastic and refrigerated overnight, or even to the following day 
    if it isn't wet (20 min) .</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; This should be very fresh crisp bunches of 
  mature spinach - <u>never</u> baby spinach, a bland product for bland 
  people. If the spinach doesn't look real good (it's usually best 
  when it is cheapest), buy more. You want to end up with at least 8  
  ounces of leaves and 6 ounces of stems after washing and spinning dry. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ch_spinachz.html">Spinach</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Flake</h3> &nbsp; [Gochu-garu] &nbsp; This must be Korean flake, 
  which is moderately hot, while others may be very hot. The amount given is 
  barely noticeable - increase if you wish.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Southeast Asian, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always 
  be on hand for these cuisines. They are available already toasted in 
  Asian markets, but are better and more reliable freshly made at home. 
  See our easy recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
  Seeds</b></a>. Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, 
  they will keep for several months.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Yield:</h3> &nbsp; Yield weight of 12 ounces is for very good bunches 
  of Spinach, and using all the stems. If you use only half the stems it 
  will be 9 ounces, but there is no reason not to use all the stems, they 
  are sweeter than the leaves.</li>
