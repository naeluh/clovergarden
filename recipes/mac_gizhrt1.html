This fine, meaty appetizer from Lebanon is easy to make and satisfyingly 
flavorful - and it goes well with Arak (see <a href="mac_gizhrt1.html#04">Note-4</a>). 
It can be made a couple days in advance and refrigerated.

  <li>Cut <b>GIZZARDS</b> across the membrane (they are usually sold 
    as two lumps connected by a membrane). Mix with <b>HEARTS</b></li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.

  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Ghee</b> and fry 
    <b>Gizzard mix</b> stirring until it has exuded as much liquid as it 
    will. Add the additional 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, cover 
    and simmer until the Hearts and Gizzards are as soft as you want 
    them - they should still have a little chew to them, but not too 
    much.</li>
  <li>Uncover and boil down until the Gizzards are frying in the Ghee. 
    Fry them, stirring often, until they are lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Onion Mix</b> and fry stirring until the onions are 
    translucent but not browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> until completely distributed, then 
    stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>. Fry stirring for a minute or so, then 
    turn off heat.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Gizzards <small>&amp;</small> Hearts:</h3> &nbsp; Of 
  course you could use just one or the other if you wish to, or if 
  availability is uneven.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mixed Spice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard Lebanese spice mix. 
  It's easy to make by our recipe on page <a href="myv_mixspice1.html">
  <b>Mixed Spices - Baharat</b></a>. You could also use 7 Spice mix (on 
  the same page), though that is more often used as a rub.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian name, because 
  that is the name you'll normally find it by. It is also much used in 
  the Near East and Anatolia as Sumneh (Lebanon), Samin Imfakis (Syria) 
  and S&uuml;zme Yag (Turkey). It is thoroughly clarified butter, sold 
  in any market that serves an Indian community - or you can make it 
  yourself  - see our recipe <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee &amp; 
  Clarified Butter</b></a>. Avoid "vegetable ghee" because much of it is 
  trans fats. Of course you could use Olive Oil (Pure, not Virgin) but 
  the flavor will be different.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Arak:</h3> &nbsp; This anise flavored high proof 
  beverage is the national beverage of Lebanon - very similar to Turkish 
  Raki and Greek Ouzo. It's not used just among the Christians (40% of 
  the Lebanese population). Muslims are pretty casual about alcoholic 
  beverages in Turkey, Lebanon and Egypt.</li>
