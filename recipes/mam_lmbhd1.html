This is a very simple way to prepare Lamb Head. It is presented at the 
table, where guests pick off pieces of the meat and season them with 
salt and cumin. See also <a href="mam_lmbhd1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>LAMB HEAD</b> and remove Brain. Brains are cooked separately 
    (<a href="mam_lmbhd1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). The Tongue steams with the rest 
    of the head.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> and mix with <b>Salt</b>. Rub this mix all 
    over the Lamb Head.</li>
  <li>Grind more <b>Cumin</b> for dipping.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> very coarse.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Arrange your steamer. If necessary, cut the <b>Lamb Head</b> into 
    pieces to fit the steamer - use a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
    by a soft faced mallet for this. I use a wok with a steamer grate 
    and fitted lid,allowing me to serve the head intact in all its glory.
    </li>
  <li>Pour water into the steamer to a little below the steamer grate. 
    Stir in <b>Onion</b> and <b>Parsley</b> for aromatic steam. Place 
    the <b>Lamb Head</b> in the steamer and bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Cover tightly and steam at a low boil for about 3-1/2 hours, or 
    a little more, until meat can be pulled easily from the bone. Watch 
    your water level and add boiling water as needed.</li>
  <li>Set out on a platter to be picked apart by guests. Provide shallow 
    bowls with salt and cumin (I mix them) to use as a dip - very little 
    will be needed.</li>
  <li>Salad forks are good for harvesting bits of meat from the head. 
    Once all visible meat is gone, remove the jaw bone and more will be 
    found under it. The guest of  honor gets to eat the eye.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb Head:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California Lamb Heads are 
  sold as unmatched halves. They are skinned and cleaned. For a lot 
  more details, see our <a href="../ingred/as_headz.html"><b>Lamb 
  Head</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Parsley / Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; Use either, or a mix of the two 
  to provide aromatic steam along with the Onions.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Prep:</h3> Fortunately, we can buy heads ready to cook from meat 
  markets. Outside the cities, folks have to char the head over a 
  charcoal fire and rub off the hair and skin.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Brains:</h3> &nbsp; I have sampled brains of cow, pig and sheep.  
  I have rejected them in general, and sheep brains in particular. They 
  are mostly cholesterol, and I like neither the taste nor the texture - 
  the Zombies are welcome to them. Other opinions differ.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I call this recipe an "appetizer" because 
  there isn't enough meat on a half lamb head to satisfy even one 
  moderately hungry person.</li>
