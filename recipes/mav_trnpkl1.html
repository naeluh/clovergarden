This appetizer / condiment is very popular throughout the Levant and 
beyond. This recipe is a natural salt pickled version with no vinegar 
used - just like real German / Polish sauerkraut and Korean Kimchee 
(see <a href="mav_trnpkl1.html#03">Note-3</a>). Some recipes allow up to 2 T Sugar, 
but most allow no sugar. This recipe is sized to fit in a 1/2 gallon 
Kimchee jar.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ weeks - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel the <b>TURNIPS</b> thinly with a sharp vegetable peeler. 
    Slice a little off the top, then slice into bite size pieces 1/4 
    to 3/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>BEET</b> and slice into pieces similar to the Turnip 
    pieces.  Tumble the two together until evenly mixed.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Turnip Mix</b> into your pickling jar.</li>
  <li>Place 4 cups <b>Water</b> and the <b>Salt</b> in saucepan. Bring 
    to a boil, and let cool a couple of minutes. Pour into the pickling 
    jar.</li>
  <li>Let sit until cool enough to handle.  By this time, the Turnips 
    will have softened and can be pushed down into the jar. A good way 
    to keep them under the pickling liquid is to insert a large 
    Cabbage leaf, convex side down, and work it around under the shoulder 
    of the jar. It should also be covered by the liquid to avoid mold.
    </li>
  <li>Cover, but not too tightly as gasses will have to escape. Set aside 
    in a room temperature place away from direct sunlight. The Turnips 
    will be ready in 3 to 4 weeks depending on weather.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Turnips:</h3> &nbsp; Select White Turnips that are fresh and fairly 
  small. Large, old, or long stored turnips can become a bit fibrous.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Important</u> - The amount of salt is 
  quite critical. 2.6 ounces = 75 grams. Weigh if at all possible. This 
  amount is a heaping 1/3 cup coarse Korean sea salt, or a level 1/4 cup 
  fine grain refined sea salt. This recipe will ferment with regular 
  table salt, but it works better if you use real, unrefined sea salt. 
  Most major brands of "sea salt" are heavily refined (they make more 
  on the stuff they refine out than on the salt). Those "trace minerals" 
  are important to proper fermentation. Also, refined salts may contain 
  anti-caking agents which can make your pickle cloudy. Kosher salt is 
  highly refined and contains anti-caking agents (except none in Diamond 
  Crystal). The best place to get real, unrefined sea salt at an 
  acceptable price is from a Korean market. Koreans do a <u>lot</u> of 
  salt fermenting, and demand the real thing.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fermentation:</h3> &nbsp;  Aside from a generally better flavor, 
  naturally fermented vegetables are noted to improve gut flora, which 
  is held by many health practitioners to improve everything else, 
  including brain health.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Brine:</h3> &nbsp; Should you need to top up the jar at any time, 
  make a brine of 1 teaspoon salt to 1 cup water. Bring it to a boil, 
  let cool, and add to the jar.</li>
