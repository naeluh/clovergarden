An excellent salad, and not difficult, but you need to start making it 
well in advance. It worked fine with regular lettuce when Radichio was 
not available.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 day - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <a href="mjv_lemonmint1.html"><b>Lemon Mint Dressing</b></a>.
    This salad will need at least 2/3 of that recipe,</li>
  <li>Soak <b>TONGUES</b> in cold water for 4 hours (if you have time).
    </li>
  <li>Put <b>Tongues</b> in a pot with lots of cold water (the tongues 
    will expand at first) and bring to a boil for 15 minutes. Pour out 
    into a clean sink.</li> 
  <li>Clean the pot. Return <b>Tongues</b> to the pot and add cold water 
    to cover. Slice <b>Celery</b> and <b>Carrots</b> medium, quarter 
    <b>Onion</b> lengthwise, put in with tongues along with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Vinegar</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Let <b>Tongues</b> stand in the broth until just cool enough to 
    handle, then peel off skins - but see <a href="mgm_lmbtong2.html#07">
    <b>Note-7</b></a>. Return to broth, cool well, and chill thoroughly 
    in the refrigerator, preferably overnight.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>When <b>Tongues</b> are thoroughly chilled, remove them from the 
    broth and slice about 1/8 inch thick (some recipes shred the tongue). 
    </li>
  <li>Make salad: tear <b>RADICHIO</b> medium. Slice <b>PICKLES</b> 
    very thin diagonally (split in half lengthwise before slicing if 
    quite large). Slice <b>CELERY</b> diagonally very thin, including 
    leaves. Chop <b>Mint Leaves</b> coarse (measure is after chopping). 
    Peel <b>RED ONION</b>, cut in half lengthwise and and slice very 
    thin. Mix all.</li>
  <li>When about ready to serve: Let <b>Tongue slices</b> come to room 
    temperature.</li>
  <li>Scatter warm <b>Tongue</b> slices over the <b>Salad</b>, spoon on 
    enough <b>Mint Dressing</b> to moisten the salad (about 2/3 of our 
    recipe) Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Toss 
    well and serve.</li>
  <li>Serve cool, but not chilled.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb Tongues:</h3> &nbsp; These will most often be found packed in 
  foam trays of 4 to 6 in markets that serve Levantine, Middle Eastern, 
  Armenian, Turkish, North African or other lamb focused communities. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/as_tongz.html">
  <b>Lamb Tongues</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Distilled white vinegar can will work fine 
  - or lemon juice if you prefer.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lettuce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe, by a chef, specified 
  Radichio. Due to COVID-19 supply disruptions, Radichio wasn't 
  available, so the photo example is with regular red leaf lettuce, 
  and it worked fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mikti Pickles:</h3> &nbsp; These are often labeled "Wild Cucumber" 
  and are quite different in taste from regular pickles - they're a melon, 
  not a cucumber. These are widely available in cans or jars in markets 
  that serve a Levantine, Middle Eastern, Turkish, or Caucasian community. 
  For details See our <a href="../ingred/ml_armoz.html"><b>Armenian 
  Cucumber</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Celery Hearts:</h3> &nbsp; Use the tender yellow and light green 
  stalks from the center of the celery. including any leaves found there.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lemon Mint Dressing:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard Lebanese 
  dressing, variously made. See our <a href="mjv_lemonmint1.html">
  <b>Lemon Mint Dressing</b></a> page for recipe. This recipe will 
  consume around 2/3 of that recipe.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Skinning Tongues:</h3> &nbsp; This can be difficult for some 
  tongues, impossible for others, even in the same batch. If the skin 
  won't peel, or is too tender to peel, or you just don't want the 
  trouble, leave it on - it's perfectly edible.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Lebanese Lamb Tongue salads are served with 
  the lamb tongue heated up just before mixing it into the salad, but 
  this often doesn't work well here, so I call for "room temperature".
  </li>
