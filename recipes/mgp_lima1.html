This is a very nice salad or meze (appetizer), and fairly substantial, 
since it's mostly lima beans. It can be made well ahead and benefits 
from some rest time to blend flavors.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lima Beans:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer the larger Fordhook Lima Beans, 
  but due to the yuppie craze for baby everything they are no longer 
  much available, so I used frozen Baby Lima Beans. See also 
  <a href="mgp_lima1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cherry Tomatoes</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California these have 
  been mostly replaced by the much smaller Grape Tomatoes, Other small 
  tomatoes can be used, cut appropriately.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for dried "Butter 
  Beans". What a "Butter Bean" is is regional, and I'm certain the 
  photo of the dish was not made with dried beans, They might have been 
  fresh, but could have been frozen. It is common for cookbooks 
  published in England to have photos that are much nicer than what 
  you'd get from the recipe. Frozen beans make a much better looking 
  dish than dried, and with a lot less effort.</li>
