This delectable salad is unique to Lebanon. In Syria, they process it 
into a dip, but admit it originated in Lebanon. See

  <ol>
  <li>Place the beets in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and keep at 
    a strong simmer until they are done. This is when a sharp skewer can 
    be run through the largest one without hitting a hard spot in the 
    middle. Cool in cold water enough to handle them and rub off the skins.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut the slices into 
    about 1/2 inch squares.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Pound to paste in a mortar 
    along with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Tahini</b> into <b>Garlic mix</b>. Gradually stir in 
    <b>Yogurt</b> until you have a fairly thick sauce. If it is too 
    thick, add more Yogurt.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Dressing</b> into <b>Beets</b> until they are evenly coated.
    </li>
  <li>Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with <b>Dried Dill</b> 
    (yes, dried is an abomination in California - but it's normal in 
    Turkey and Lebanon). Serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; Buy fresh small beets, around 3 inches diameter. 
  Preferably, they should have stems and leaves (leave 1-1/2 inches of 
  stems on them), but at least a stubble of their leaf stems. Beets cut 
  below the stem stubble were probably in storage way too long for 
  good flavor, and will bleed too much of their color when boiled.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; Use a tart natural yogurt, not a heavy, 
  "Greek" or bland one - nor a "fat free" or flavored one.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If making ahead, it is best to mix the 
  dressing with the beets just before serving, or the dish will become 
  a uniform pink, rather than pink and white as in the photo.</li>
