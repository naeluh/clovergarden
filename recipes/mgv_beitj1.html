This is a "spoon salad", to be eaten with flat bread. It's a simple 
salad typical of Gazan refugees driven from the village of Beit Jirja, 
when it was destroyed by Israelis - see <a href="mgv_beitj1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Dill:</h3> &nbsp; If fresh dill is not available, the pattern 
  recipe allows 1/2 T Dill Seeds, but here in Southern California, Fresh 
  Dill is much easier to find than Dill Seeds.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; I do not know what chili they would use in 
  Gaza, but do know they are very fond of rather hot chilis. One Serrano 
  with seeds makes this salad fairly hot by Southern California standards, 
  so if you don't like it that hot, scrape out the seed mass before 
  chopping.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Use Persian or some other smaller diameter 
  cucumber that doesn't need peeling or seeding (English, Mediterranean, 
  European, Japanese, Kirby). If you have only the standard waxed green 
  blimps, peel and seed them before weighing.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tahini, Dark:</h3> &nbsp; I have found at least a dozen brands of 
  Tahini in my local markets, but all of them are light. The pattern 
  recipe suggests mixing 1 t Dark Sesame Oil with 1 T light Tahini.</li>
<li id="05"> 
  <h3>Comments:</h3> In Gaza, the Tahini and Olive Oil must often be 
  omitted due to Israeli embargoes and extreme poverty. The Israelis 
  have bombed all the olive and fruit orchards in the Gaza Strip into 
  stubble. In violation of international treaty they have cut off the 
  water supply. The aquifer will soon be depleted and it will not be 
  possible to grow food there at all. Also in violation of international 
  treaty, the Israelis prevent Gazan fishing boats from going out to 
  where the fish are. The Gazans survive mostly on international food 
  aid, but that aid money must be spent to buy food from Israel at 
  inflated prices, because Israel blockades food from any other 
  source, and allows no exports from the Gaza Strip. In disregard for 
  International law and human rights, Israel is a criminal country.
