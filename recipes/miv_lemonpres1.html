An indispensable ingredient for Moroccan cooking, also used through 
North Africa, and as far east as India and Cambodia. It goes into lamb 
and vegetable tagines (stews), with chicken, and in salads, soups, etc.

You can also use Preserved Lemon for Western dishes wherever lemon and 
salt are called for. The lemon brine itself is a delicious ingredient 
that tempts the imagination. The optional spicing is in the manner of 
Safi, Morocco.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (33 days - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>If the <b>LEMON</b> lemon rinds are a little thick, it is best to 
    soften them so they will pack better and need less lemon juice. Do 
    this by soaking whole lemons in water for 3 days, changing the water 
    every day.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Lemons</b> from the pointy end to within 1/2 inch of the stem 
    end into quarters. Sprinkle salt over the exposed lemon pulp and then 
    massage back into lemon shape. This is <u>very</u> traditional, but 
    some heretics do cut them all the way into quarters.</li> 
  <li>Place 2 T <b>Salt</b> in the bottom of the jar. Tightly pack in a 
    layer of lemons and squash them down tight. Sprinkle more salt over 
    the layer, and some of the spices (if used). Repeat until lemons are 
    all in the jar, then add any remaining salt.</li>
  <li>Squeeze as much fresh <b>Lemon Juice</b> as is needed to cover the 
    lemons completely and seal the jar (see <a href="miv_lemonpres1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Keep in a warm spot to ferment for 30 days, shaking the jar every 
    day to distribute the brine. If you really must, you can start using 
    them after 2 weeks. If necessary, add more lemon juice and salt to 
    keep them submerged or they will develop some mold which will cause 
    mushy spots (see <a href="miv_lemonpres1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). </li>
  <li>When they are done they can be used as needed. Keep them in a cool 
    place, no need to refrigerate. Should some white mold form just rinse 
    it off the lemon before using. Note, the brine is good for a year and 
    can be used for as many as three batches of lemons.</li>
  <li><b>Usage:</b> &nbsp; Many recipes call for discarding the pulp and 
    using only the rind, but others use both together. Another common 
    plan is to use the pulp in the sauce and the thinly sliced rind as 
    a garnish. Some suggest rinsing the lemon before use to remove the 
    salty brine, but others prefer to get the full impact of flavors. 
    Basically, you can use your own preference and judgement.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lemons:</h3> &nbsp; In North Africa, small lemons  
  with thin rinds are used, about 1-3/8 inches diameter. Those in the 
  photo were Southern Calfiornia "backyard" lemons with thin rinds, 
  probably an unnamed hybrid of Meyer Lemon and some other kind - more 
  sour than regular Meyer lemons. These would be much like the North 
  African lemons, but quite a bit larger at 2-3/8 inches. Many people 
  use Meyer lemons, but writers with extensive experience in Morocco 
  report excellent results using the standard California Eureka lemons, 
  carefully selected for thin rinds (you do this by feel, they shouldn't 
  be hard).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Always use natural sea salt 
  for salt fermented recipes - table salt and name brand "sea salt" are 
  lacking some mineral salts that help with fermentation. Natural sea 
  salt can be purchased cheaply in plastic bags from any market serving 
  a Korean community or expensively from the health food aisle. Natural 
  sea salt always feels a little moist. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/salt.html"><b>Salt</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Juice:</h3> &nbsp; Use only freshly squeezed lemon juice - 
  no substitutes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Jar:</h3> &nbsp; I use a 2 quart kimchee jar. 
  To hold the lemons down below the brine surface, I use a plastic lid 
  just small enough to fit into the jar, inverted, with a sterilized flat 
  rock on top of it. See <a href="miv_lemonpres1x.html">
  <b>Photo</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; These lemons were much used in England and 
  North America until early in the 19th century, when improved 
  transportation started bringing fresh lemons. The brine is still 
  popular in Bloody Marys. Limes can also be pickled by this same 
  method, and are liked in more tropical regions where lemons don't 
  grow well.</li>
