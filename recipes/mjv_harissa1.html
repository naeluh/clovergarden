Used with vegetables, meats and fish, this chili sauce is essential to 
the cuisine of Tunisia, almost as important in Algeria, and gaining 
favor in Morocco. It is used in sandwiches as far east as Israel.

Commercial Harissas I've tasted have been <u>awful</u>. If you can't 
take time to make your own, you're better off using Huy Fong Chili Garlic 
Sauce, maybe cut a bit with tomato sauce and add some spices. This recipe 
makes a fairly mild sauce, but feel free to hotten it up.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Blast the <b>CHILIS</b> and the <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane Torch</b></a>. Brush off 
    the skin under running water (a few charred bits left won't hurt any).
    </li>
  <li>Cap <b>Chilis</b>, cut in half lengthwise and core them. Seed them, 
  but leave as much of the membranes as you can for hotness.</li>
  <li>Cap and core the <b>Bell Pepper</b> and cut into strips.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GARLIC</b> small.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Vegetables</b> and run in a processor or blender 
    until as smoothly pur&eacute;ed as you can get them (my mini-prep 
    processor is just big enough to do this whole recipe at once). If 
    you need to you can add a little of the wet ingredients for 
    processing.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>SPICES</b> fine in your spice grinder (see 
    <a href="mjv_harissa1.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Mix in all <b>Wet items</b>.</li>
  <li>Check hotness. If it isn't hot enough for you grind up some dried 
    hot red chilis in your spice grinder and mix in.</li>
  <li>Store refrigerated in a sealed jar with enough olive oil poured 
    over it to seal it from air. It should keep for a month or so. For 
    longer storage I freeze it flat, about 1/2 inch thick, in a plastic 
    bag. It's easy to cut off just what I need and rebag it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red 
  ripe Fresno chilis, or red ripe jalapenos if available (Huy Fong Foods 
  buys nearly all of those for their famous chili sauces). Holland Red 
  or similar chilis would also work. If you want a hotter sauce, you 
  could replace the Bell Pepper with an equal weight of red chilis. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Cumin:</h3> &nbsp; [Kala Jeera (India)] 
  This is <u>NOT</u> Nigella / Kalonji (unfortunately called "Black 
  Cumin" in Bengali), but a smaller, darker relative of regular Cumin, 
  with a different flavor. It can be found in markets serving an Indian 
  community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_cuminz.html"><b>Cumin</b></a> page. If you don't have 
  it, you'll have to use a little more regular Cumin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Smoked paprika can be had 
  from various Spanish food emporiums. If you can't get it, use regular 
  Hungarian paprika (please not sawdust flavored supermarket paprika) 
  and leave a little more of the blackened skin on the chilis.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Pur&eacute;e:</h3> &nbsp; I generally 
  don't want to open a whole can of Tomato Pur&eacute;e for 1 Tablespoon. 
  I usually have a plug of light Tomato Sauce from an 8 oz can in the 
  freezer compartment and just slice some off.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Spices:</h3> &nbsp; Many North African preparers 
  dry pan roast the spices as is done in India (until nicely fragrant - 
  don't burn - you should see no smoke and see only slight color change). 
  Cool well before grinding.</li>
