This hot sauce is particularly popular in Egypt, where it has been much 
used for Koshari, the ubiquitous "comfort food" of that country. Shatta 
is also popular in Palestine. It should not be confused with 
<a href="mjv_shata1.html"><b>Shata - Sudanese</b></a> (one "T") popular 
in Sudan - it is very different.

  <p>The only difference between our Red and Green Shattas is that the

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Whatever red chilis might be used in 
  Egypt and Palestine are not likely to be found in North America. 
  Around here we all use red ripe Fresno chilis, or red ripe 
  jalape&ntilde;os if available (Huy Fong Foods buys nearly all of 
  those for their famous chili sauces). Holland Red or similar chilis 
  would also work - or even Red Anaheims, since most of the heat comes 
  from the Thai Chilis. In the Region there is a moderately hot chili 
  named "Shatta", that may or may not be associated with this sauce, 
  as "Shatta" is just a word for "Red" in Arabic. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; In North Africa, red 
  Piri Piri chilis would be used, but those are not much available in 
  North America. Much more available Thai Chilis (preferably red for 
  the Red Shatta), are similarly hot. The amount given makes this sauce 
  satisfyingly hot by Southern California standards - use your own best 
  judgement as to how many. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro <small>&amp;</small> Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is 
  chopped medium and lightly packed. Always use Flat Leaf Parsley for 
  cooking <u>never</u> curly leaf, which is more like plastic than like 
  an herb. 2 T each for Red Shatta, 1 cup each for Green Shatta.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I have seen a note or two that there are 
  both red and green versions of Shatta. Strangely, there are many 
  Shatta recipes on the Internet, and most that have photos show a red 
  sauce - but many of those same recipes call for an amount of green 
  herbs that can't possibly make a red sauce. I can only attribute 
  this to indiscriminate copying of recipes and photos on the Internet, 
  without actually testing the recipes. Commercial Red Shatta is less 
  hot than home made, and usually includes tomatoes.</li>
