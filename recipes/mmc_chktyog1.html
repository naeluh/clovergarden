A very important recipe to the Druze people in the Hauran region of 
Syria. It is often served at parties, carried in accompanied by special 
songs - like the Scots piping in the haggis. See

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Measure out all items for the <b>Sauce</b>. You can whip it 
    and cook it while the chicken simmers.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart is good), 
    heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring until lightly 
    golden. A sprinkle of salt will help them fry evenly.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then 
    stir in the <b>Chicken</b>. Season with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a boil, cover and turn to a simmer. 
    Stir a couple of times until the chicken is tender (about 30 
    minutes).</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u> - Make Sauce; Beat together very well <b>Broth</b>, 
    <b>Yogurt</b> and <b>Egg</b>. The pattern recipe suggests using a 
    Blender, but I find a wire whip and a strong arm work fine.</li> 
  <li>Pour the <b>Sauce</b> into a heavy bottomed saucepan. Set on 
    moderate heat and  stir continuously in a single direction 
    (important to prevent curdling) until it comes to a boil - see 
    <a href="mmc_chktyog1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>. Select a heat level that will 
    bring it to a boil in a little less than 1/2 hour of stirring. I 
    use an instant read thermometer to check the progress. When up to 
    a boil, stir in <b>Turmeric</b> for another minute.</li> 
  <li>When <b>Chicken</b> is done, stir in the <b>Sauce</b> and simmer 
    another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, traditionally over a bed of Bulgur Wheat - see 
    <a href="mmc_chktyog1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>. This recipe reheats well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Thigh and Leg 
  meat without bones, fat or skin.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken Broth:</h3> &nbsp; When preparing for a dish of 
  this type, I buy chicken a day ahead as whole thighs or whole leg 
  quarters. I remove skin, bones and fat, putting all that in a pot 
  with water to cover well. I simmer for about 4 hours, then strain out 
  and discard the solids. The fat is easily removed using a gravy 
  separator. This becomes the broth for the recipe. It is strong enough 
  to be extended a bit with water if need be. For more on making and 
  storing Broth,   see our page <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup 
  Stock / Broth - General Method</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bulgur:</h3> &nbsp; Bulgur is fully cooked, and #1 needs only a 
  hot water soak, but for dishes of this sort I like #3 which needs a 
  bit more. Place it in a saucepan pour boiling water over to (3 cups 
  Water per cup of Bulgur). Let sit for 30 minutes or so, then cook 
  the same as you would steamed rice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; Once this dish is brought in with singing, 
  dancing and ceremony, a whole lot of expensive hot Ghee is poured 
  over it to show the generosity of the host. Most of us in the West 
  would skip that excess - but suit yourself. I like this recipe with 
  Steamed Rice, but that would be quite expensive in Syria, so they 
  are accustomed to Bulgur Wheat.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Why stir in a single direction? I don't know, 
  but I've seen a number of ethnic recipes from different regions that 
  call for that, so I do it. You can take breaks from stirring, but only 
  for a few seconds.</li>
