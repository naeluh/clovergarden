The ingredients may seem simple, but this dish is simply delicious!  
Frying the onions is critical. The darker they are the more intense the 
flavor, and the darker the color of the rice, but there must be no 
burning.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FILLETS</b> into convenient chunks, maybe 1-1/2 inches on 
    a side.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Slice as uniformly as possible for even browning.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>Rice</b> and drain. Set aside.</li> 
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b></li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (70 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt is good) heat <b>Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Onions</b> stirring until dark brown. Use care - there 
    must be no burning - which would make them bitter. A sprinkle of 
    salt will help them brown evenly.</li>
  <li>Remove the <b>Onions</b> and drain, retaining all the oil in 
    the saut&eacute; pan.</li>
  <li>Place the <b>Onions</b> in a large sauce pan with 4 cups 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until Onions are very 
    soft, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>While this is going on, the saut&eacute; pan with the oil is 
    idle, so use it to fry the <b>Pine Nuts</b>, stirring until they 
    are very lightly browned - careful, they are easily ruined. Drain 
    them, keeping all the oil in the pan.</li>
  <li>Strain out <b>Onions</b>, retaining the liquid. Pur&eacute;e 
    <b>Onions</b> and return to the pan with the liquid.</li>
  <li>Place Fish in the pan, along with <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    then simmer slowly until just done. For Tilapia this could be as 
    little as 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain out the Fish and keep warm.</li>
  <li>Heat up the saut&eacute; pan again and pour in the <b>Rice</b>. 
    Fry stirring for a couple minutes. Stir in <b>Cumin</b> and 2-1/2 
    cups of the <b>Broth</b>. Bring just to a boil, cover tightly and 
    simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let 
    the rice rest for 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Meanwhile, take broth remaining in the sauce pan and simmer down 
    to a little less than 1 cup. Turn off the heat and stir in 
    <b>Lemon Juice</b> to make a Sauce.</li>
  <li>Gently stir <b>Fish</b> into <b>Rice</b>. Place in your serving 
    platter and drizzle <b>Sauce</b> over it.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Pine Nuts</b> and <b>Parsley</b>. Serve warm. 
    This dish can be reheated in the oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Usa a light colored fish that holds together 
  reasonably well. Though it's a little delicate, I have used Tilapia 
  very successfully. Vietnamese Catfish (Swai) would work fine if there 
  will be no kosher considerations.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use "Pure" Olive oil, not Virgin which has a 
  stonger flavor and doesn't stand up to heat well. Once again I have 
  cut the amount of oil in half from the pattern recipe. If you do heavy 
  farm and field labor or work in a steel mill, feel free to increase 
  the amount.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe, scaled to make twice what 
  I make here, started with a whole 4 pound fish. They  filleted it after 
  cooking in the broth and aimed for a restaurant style serving. Though 
  I certainly don't shy from using whole fish, this seemed impractical 
  (and their photo didn't match the recipe at all anyway), so I 
  reorganized it for fillets.</li>
