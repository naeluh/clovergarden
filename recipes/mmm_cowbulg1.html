A substantial and satisfying main dish - serve with a salad. Of course, 
few Levantine cookbooks admit that any meat but lamb is used in the 
region, but that isn't true (see <a href="mmm_cowbulg1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). You 
can certainly use Lamb if you wish.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into 1 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Wash and drain <b>BULGUR</b>. Squeeze out excess water with your 
    hands and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Peel and chop 
    coarse. Mix together all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious (3-1/2 qt.) coverable saut&eacute; pan heat 1/4 cup 
    <b>Ghee</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent, then stir in 
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until all exuded liquid is gone and 
    you are getting some browning in the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b> and fry stirring for a few 
    minutes. Pour in 4 cups <b>Water</b>, bring to a simmer and simmer 
    covered until meat is tender, about 1-1/4 hour.</li>
  <li>When Beef is done: in a separate pan, heat 1/4 cup <b>Ghee</b> 
    and fry <b>Bulgur</b> over moderate heat, stirring for about 10 
    minutes. If you see any wisps of smoke, turn off the heat.</li>
  <li>Spread <b>Bulgur</b> evenly over the simmering <b>Beef</b>. 
    Simmer covered tightly, stirring now and then until Bulgur is fluffy 
    and cooked. It should be just a little chewy. Check it as it simmers. 
    If it is getting too dry and starts to stick to the pan, add a 
    little boiling water.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Any stewing cut should work, but Chuck will 
  cook faster and is tastier. It  should be quite lean. I call for beef 
  because lamb is rather expensive in North America - and by time you've 
  struggled to trim the fat and bones there's not much left. Beef 
  <u>is</u> used in Levantine recipes, but usually ground, as their beef 
  is very far from tender. Our beef works fine. This recipe can also be 
  made with Chicken.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bulgur:</h3> &nbsp; #3 is medium coarse. Do not 
  attempt to use regular cracked wheat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_bulgz.html"><b>Bulgur Wheat</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mixed Spices:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard ingredient in Lebanon 
  and surrounding countries. See our recipe 
  <a href="myv_mixspice1.html"><b>Mixed Spices - Baharat</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is a highly clarified 
  butter, available in markets serving Indian and Middle Eastern 
  communities, but also easily made at home by our recipe 
  <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee and Clarified Butter</b></a>. 
  If you are still afraid of butter, Olive Oil could be used, but the 
  flavor will be quite different. Ethnic recipes often call for amounts 
  of oils and fats appropriate for heavy labor, but not for our more 
  "information culture". In both instances I have cut the amount of Ghee 
  called for in half. You can restore the amounts if you want a richer 
  dish.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did most of the cooking in a 
  "moderate oven" in a covered casserole. Here in Southern California we 
  don't fire up an oven unless we really need to, and this recipe works 
  fine, more conveniently, and faster on the stovetop.</li>
