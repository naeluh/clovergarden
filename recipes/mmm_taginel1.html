which has been steamed over the stew - see recipe
<a href="mmp_couscous1.html"><b>Couscous</b></a> but they go fine

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>LAMB</b> into chunks about 1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine, grate <b>ONION</b> or chop very 
    fine.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Lamb</b> in in a coverable enameled iron casserole or 
    spacious stainless saut&eacute; pan. Mix in all <b>Aromatic items</b> 
    and 1 c <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer tightly covered for 
    1-1/2 hours or until very tender, stirring frequently and making sure 
    it doesn't dry out.</li>
  <li>Shave strings from <b>CELERY</b> (if needed) and cut in half lengthwise 
    (or thirds if quite large), then into 2 inch lengths. Peel 
    <b>CARROTS</b> and split in half lengthwise (or quarters if very 
    large) and cut into 2 inch lengths to match Celery. Mix.</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PRESERVED LEMON</b> into strips about 1/4 inch wide and 
    remove seeds. Some discard pulp, others don't. I just cut out the center 
    strand with shears.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>When <b>Lamb</b> has simmered until very tender (1-1/2 to 2 hours), 
    stir in <b>Celery Mix</b> and add water if needed. Simmer another 10 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Olives</b> and <b>Preserved Lemon</b>. Continue to simmer 
     for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>. If you have left the pulp on the 
     preserved lemon use 1-1/2 T, if you used only the peel use 2 T.  
     Take off heat.</li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Lamb</b> in the center of a platter. Arrange <b>Vegetables</b> 
     around (or just leave it all mixed and say the servants took the day 
     off) and keep hot.</li>
  <li>Quickly boil down liquid to a light sauce consistency (if not already 
     there) and pour over <b>Lamb</b> and <b>Vegetables</b>. Serve hot with 
     Couscous or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless lamb with 
  all excess fat removed. Mutton and goat can also be used. The problem 
  with all these is the ratio of fat and bone to meat. Yields run from 
  45% to 52%, usually closer to 45%. Do use the bones and fat to make 
  soup stock. Mmodern practice includes the fat, because it has been 
  found much of the flavor in fat is water soluble, and the fat is 
  easily removed using a gravy separator.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Celery:</h3> &nbsp; This is supposed to be tender 
  inner stalks, but if what you have is large stalks, use a vegetable 
  peeler to strip the strings off the back. If medium, it's probably 
  enough to just run the peeler down both edges.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Moroccan olives or salt/oil cured 
  Greek or Turkish olives. Don't use canned black olives, they're 
  completely different. Don't bother with an olive pitter - they don't 
  work. Just whack the olive with the side of your prep knife enough to 
  break it open. The pit will remove easily.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Preserved Lemon:</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential 
  North African ingredient. Jars of Preserved Lemon can be found in 
  markets serving North African, Levanitne or Middle Eastern communities 
  - or much better, make your own per our recipe 
  <a href="miv_lemonpres1.html"><b>Preserved Lemons</b></a>. It's easy 
  but it takes a few weeks for fermentation time. Most recipes use only 
  the peel, but some leave the pulp on.</li>
