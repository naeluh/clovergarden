This is practically the "national dish" of Egypt, served in almost every 
restaurant and by thousands of street vendors - but it's not Egyptian in 
origin. It is based on the Anglo-Indian Kitchari (Kedgeree) brought by 
the English, plus Pasta from Italian influence.

  <p>This recipe may look difficult, but it isn't if you are organized. 
    See <a href="mmx_koshari1.html#04"><b>Method</b></a>.</p>
  <b><u>Do-ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Tomato Sauce</b> (see <a href="mmx_koshari1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin. Sprinkle with 
    1/8 t <b>Salt</b> and fry in <b>Oil</b> over low flame, stirring 
    often, until caramelized - very dark, but not at all burned 
    (bitter). The salt will help them brown evenly.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Chickpeas</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Put out your <b>Onions</b> and <b>Chickpeas</b> to warm to room 
    temperature.</li>
  <li>Put <b>LENTILS</b> in a sauce pan with water to cover well. Bring 
    to a boil and simmer until just done (about 20 minutes). They should 
    be cooked through, but still reasonably firm. Drain, stir in 1/4 t 
    <b>Salt</b> and keep warm.</li>
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>RICE</b>, stirring for a 
    minute or two, then add 1/4 t <b>Salt</b> and 1-3/4 cups water. Cook 
    tightly covered over low heat, about 20 minutes, same as you usually 
    cook rice. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>PASTA</b> in plenty of boiling salted water until just done.  
    Drain and return to the pot, stirring in a few drops of olive oil to 
    keep the pasta from sticking. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Bring your <b>Sauce</b> up hot for serving.</li>
  <li>Mix evenly together <b>Rice</b>, <b>Lentils</b> and <b>Pasta</b> 
    (or see <a href="mmx_koshari1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  <li>In individual bowls, place a scoop of the <b>Rice mix</b>. Top 
    with a small scoop of <b>Sauce</b> (go easy on the sauce, especially 
    if using spicy Shatta). Garnish with caramelized <b>Onions</b> and a 
    few <b>Chickpeas</b>. Serve warm. This dish can be reheated in the 
    oven, in a foil covered casserole.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; This should be about 2/3 small 
  macaroni, like ditali or small elbows, and 1/3 spaghetti, broken 
  into about 1-1/2 inch long pieces.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably Egyptian rice, but a California, 
  Spanish or Italian medium grain rice will work fine. "Egypts Best" 
  brand rice is excellent and widely available here in Southern 
  California.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Formerly, a red 
  <a href="mjv_shatta1.html"><b>Shatta Sauce</b></a> was popular, but 
  today a <a href="mjv_tombah1.html"><b>Tomato Baharat Sauce</b></a> 
  is preferred, and I recommend that sauce - it's simplicity goes well 
  with this dish.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; You want to cook the Pasta, 
  Lentils and Rice simultaneously, and have them all finish at the 
  same time. If you start them at the same time they will be close 
  enough. This is pretty much a 4 burner operation, one for each of the 
  main ingredients and one to warm the sauce. Fortunately, you don't need 
  much else for a good meal, perhaps a salad and some beer. If you have 
  done the garnishes in advance, you will have little to do for the half 
  hour the main ingredients take to cook, and serving takes only moments. 
  In case things aren't going quite right, you can hold the major 
  ingredients in a warm oven. I'm sure the street vendors have special 
  rigs that keep this stuff warm for hours. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> Professional cooks in Egypt like to serve this as 
  a layered dome, pasta at the bottom, rice in the middle and lentils 
  on top. For home service you can just mix all three, as was done in 
  the photo example.</li>
