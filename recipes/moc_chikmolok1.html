A very popular dish in Egypt since the Pharaohs (who didn't have chickens 
but could use frogs, fish and rabbits). While its mucilaginous texture may 
take some aback, it's much liked in Egypt and the Levant.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>MOLOKHYA</b>. Strip off the leaves and discard the stems. 
    Either chop the leaves very fine (regular) or roll them very tight a 
    handful at a time and shave them into fine threads (gourmet version). 
    Refrigerate until needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Put <b>CHICKEN</b>, <b>Onion</b>, <b>Bay Leaf</b> and <b>Cardamom 
    Pod</b> into a pot with <b>Chicken Broth</b> and simmer until 
    chicken is done, about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Fish out the chicken, leaf and pod. Cool chicken, strip from bones 
    and tear up or cut meat as you desire and set aside.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop fine. Grind <b>CORIANDER</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Garlic</b>, <b>Coriander</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b> over moderate heat until garlic is light golden, then 
    stir into soup.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>For Condiment: chop <b>RED ONION</b> fine, mix with <b>Vinegar</b> 
    and <b>Cinnamon</b> - not too far ahead or it becomes mushy.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Soup</b> up to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Check for <b>Salt</b>. Add <b>Molokhiya</b> to the soup and bring 
    back to a simmer for about four minutes stirring just a little. Do 
    not overcook or the molokhiya will sink to the bottom - not desirable. 
    Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b> and take off heat.</li>
  <li>In individual bowls put some <b>Rice</b> in the bottom, place as much 
    <b>Chicken</b> as desired over it and then ladle in the soup. Serve 
    immediately as it quickly loses its bright green color 
    (<a href="moc_chikmolok1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Molokhiya:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is "on the stems" and will yield 
  about 7 ounces of good leaves. If this makes a soup that's too thick 
  for you, use less or cut it back with more chicken broth, salt and 
  lemon juice.  Fresh molokhiya is easily available in Los Angeles during 
  the summer, sold as "Okra Leaf". The rest of the year, and in most 
  other cities, you have to use frozen - available from markets serving 
  Middle Eastern communities. Around 8 oz frozen molokhiya should give 
  about the same effect and is usually added to the pot frozen and 
  stirred a little until thawed. Some recipes call for dried molokhiya. 
  See our <a href="../ingred/mw_molokz.html"><b>Molokhiya Page</b></a> 
  for more information.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for raw chicken free 
  of skin, bones and fat. Use 2 pounds if joints with bone in. You can, of 
  course, use any cooked chicken you have on hand, including fried or 
  roasted. In Egypt the chicken is often fried or oven roasted with a 
  little sumac and zatar (thyme) after it is cooked in the broth. You can 
  get both cooked chicken and broth from simmering a whole chicken or 
  chicken parts while making a big batch of broth - just take what you 
  need for this recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Color:</h3> &nbsp; Kept overnight the color becomes 
  the same as the color of stuffed grape leaves. Flavor and consistency 
  remain about the same.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Wine Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Called "Grape Vinegar" in Islamic 
  countries. You have to make wine before you can make vinegar, but 
  they use a continuous process so Alah won't condemn them for making 
  drinkable wine.</li>
