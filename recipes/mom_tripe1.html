An excellent soup, and very popular in Algerian restaurants. 
It takes hours of cooking time but is actually little trouble to make. It's 
extremely difficult to overcook and reheats exceptionally well.

<b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using dried <b>CHICKPEAS</b>, soak for 8 hours 
  with salt - see <a href="mom_tripe1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> below.
  </ol>
<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4+ hrs - 50 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Put <b>Tripe</b> in a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to a 
    boil for 20 minutes. Drain, cool and cut into strips about 1/2 inch 
    wide and 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop 
    <b>Chilis</b> fine. Mix.</li> 
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> 
    until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Add 2 cups of water, bring to a boil and 
    simmer for about 20 minutes. Pur&eacute;e using a food mill, a food 
    processor, or by pressing through a strainer.</li>
  <li>Return pur&eacute;e to the pot along with the <b>Tripe</b> and 2 
    cups more <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until Tripe 
    reaches the desired consistency. Algerians like their tripe cooked 
    almost to jelly which takes well over 4 hours but the soup starts 
    being edible at around 3-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li>With about 2-1/2 hours to go, stir in <b>Caraway seeds</b>. 
    If <b>Chickpeas</b> are unsoaked and uncooked 1/2 cup should go in now 
    along with 1-1/4 cup more water.</li>
  <li>With about 1/2 hour to go, stir in <b>Paprika</b> and <b>Four Spice</b>. 
    If <b>Chickpeas</b> are thoroughly soaked, they should go in now.</li>
  <li>With 15 minutes to go, check salt and check liquid for consistency 
    you want. If <b>Chickpeas</b> were from a can they should go in now.</li>
  <li>At serving time you can garnish with fresh herbs, just stir them in or 
    provide them in a bowl for diners to apply themselves. Chopped parsley 
    and/or coriander leaves are favorites.</li>
