The flavors and textures of this soup are interesting and intense, but 
simple, making it a great soup course served before a main course, but I 
would not use it as a main course soup.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer White Rose for soups 
  and avoid the Yukon Gold type because they turn to mush if cooked a 
  little long. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Cumin:</h3> &nbsp; This is sold in Indian 
  markets as Kala Jeera or Shah Jeera and is much thinner than regular 
  cumin. <b>Do Not</b>  mistake it for Kalonji / Nigella, often called 
  "Black Cumin" due to having that name in Bengal. If you don't have Kala 
  Jeera use regular cumin - different, but usable.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Wine Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Called "Grape Vinegar" 
  or "Raisin Vinegar" in Islamic countries, in hopes of avoiding the 
  wrath of Allah (you have to make wine before you can make it into 
  vinegar, and Allah doesn't drink).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Notes:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is derived from one 
  in the famous <i>Moro</i> cookbook. Unfortunately this cookbook shares 
  some flaws with other English cookbooks. Traceability to national 
  derivations are spotty ("spotty" is way better than most English 
  cookbooks though) and it calls for ingredients by size (likely 
  different outside England) rather than by verifiable measures. I'm 
  assigning this recipe to Morocco, since they seem to use a fair number 
  of beets there.</li>
