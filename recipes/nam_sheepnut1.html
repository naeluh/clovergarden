These are a good hot appetizer which can be served with lemon wedges or a 
hot sauce. This recipe is Persian, but pretty much the same in the US, 
Australia, New Zealand and other regions where "fries" are popular.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>LAMB NUTS</b>. Cut off just a bit at both ends and run a 
    knife, sharp edge out, just under the skin lengthwise. Peel the skin 
    off. This is the hard part because the skin is <u>very</u> tough and what 
    you're peeling it off of is rather tender. I make the cut with my 
    fish filleting knife as it is thin and razor sharp at the tip.</li>
  <li>Slice the <b>Nuts</b> lengthwise into 4 slices, maybe 5 if really 
    large. Drain well, pat dry and tumble them with salt and pepper. 
    They will slice more neatly if you put them in the freezer 
    compartment long enough to stiffen them.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> reasonably well and set then out in a shallow bowl 
    for dipping.</li>
  <li>Set out <b>Bread Crumbs</b> in a plate.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LEMON</b> into wedges and allow them to come to room 
    temperature.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min) 
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a well seasoned iron skillet heat <b>Oil</b> about 1/8 inch deep 
    to about 350&deg;F - or alternatively you can deep fry them.</li> 
  <li>Dip both sides of <b>Sheep Fries</b> first in <b>Egg</b>, then in 
    <b>Bread Crumbs</b>. Fry in oil until lightly browned on both sides.
    </li>
  <li>Serve sprinkled with <b>Parsley</b> and with <b>Lemon Wedges</b> on 
    the side. They should be served hot, so if they cool reheat them in 
    the oven. If you have leftovers, reheat them in the oven for 
    breakfast.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Lamb Nuts:</b> &nbsp; Euphamistically sold as "Lamb Fries", 
  these are, not so common in North America, as most male sheep here 
  are castrated immediately after birth. They are shipped frozen from 
  Australia or New Zealand. Look for them in markets that serve a 
  significant Middle Eastern community. The best source here in 
  Los Angeles is Super King Market. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/as_nutz.html"><b>Lamb Testicles</b></a> page.</li>
