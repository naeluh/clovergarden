This flavorful salad offers an unusual contrast in textures. The 
dressing has no oil or salt, as these are provided by the fried eggplant. 
<u>Caution</u>: the eggplants can be a real problem, so read 
<a href="ngv_epltm1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> carefully.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id=01>
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; preferably, a regular 
  Globe Eggplant since that is easiest to peel (see 
  <a href="ngv_epltm1.html#04">Note-4</a>). I use a very sharp "Y" type vegetable 
  peeler. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html">
  <b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id=02>
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable high temperature 
  oil such as Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), Peanut Oil, or the like. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking 
  Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id=03>
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; I use 1/2 t Korean 
  chili flake, very common in these parts. Korean is fairly mild, so 
  that much doesn't have a big impact. Use your own preference for 
  type and amount. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id=04>
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for chopped eggplant, 
  but later calls it "eggplant cubes". They are to be soaked in salted 
  water and drained. This produced mush, with either shallow or deep 
  frying, and well before any browning occurred. My method, salting 
  without water and draining, worked well <u>some of the time</u>. 
  My method failed with eggplants so young the seed mass was very white 
  and seeds not yet well developed. In this case, I tumbled the salted 
  cubes with the Oil and roasted them lightly brown on a baking sheet in 
  a 450&deg;F/230&deg;C oven, tumbling them several times. These did not 
  bring enough oil with them, so I added 1 T oil to the Dressing. The 
  photo with the pattern recipe seems to show eggplant with purple skin 
  on, but my experience is that simply fried, as in this recipe, the 
  skins can be tough as leather. Other than these changes, I followed 
  the recipe as given.</li>
