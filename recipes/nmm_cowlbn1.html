<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart) or similar coverable 
  vessel, heat <b>Ghee</b>. Fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring until translucent.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Meat</b> and fry stirring often until liquid has boiled 
  off and meat is lightly browned all over. If the fond adhering to 
  the pan gets too dark, go to the next step immediately - chocolate 
  is OK, black is not.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Long Beans</b>, <b>Garlic</b>, <b>Herb mix</b> and 
  <b>Tomato Sauce</b> until well blended. Stir in <b>Beef Broth</b>
  and season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil, 
  cover and simmer until meat is tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Correct Liquid if needed. The photo example has about the minimum 
  amount of liquid.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef / Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless meat trimmed of all 
  excess fat. A day ahead, I buy meat with bones. I trim off the meat 
  and use the bones, membranes and fat to make the broth. This I strain, 
  discarding the solids, and use my gravy separator to remove all the fat. 
  For details see our recipe 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General Method</b>
  </a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for regular 
  "String Beans", but for several reasons I strongly prefer Long Beans, 
  now easily available here in Southern California. (1) Long beans are 
  native to Asia, while String Beans are from the Americas. 
  (2) Long Beans have a sweet dark flavor particularly complementary to 
  Beef or Lamb. (3) They stand up much better to cooking and are more 
  attractive on the plate. If I were using String Beans, I would par 
  boil them in salted water until just tender, then add them to the 
  stew near the end of cooking. The Long Beans held up well for the 
  full cooking time, but would be even nicer added about half way 
  through the simmering stage. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Spices:</h3> &nbsp; This is my addition, but I'm calling it 
  authentic until someone can prove to me that nobody in Uzbekistan has 
  ever made this with the regions most popular spice combo.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 3 Tablespoons Butter, 
  but in Central Asia most butter is made into Ghee. Ghee doesn't need 
  refrigeration, important for nomadic people, and it can go to a much 
  higher temperature than butter We're frying meat here, so that is a 
  good thing.  Ghee is available in markets serving an Indian community, 
  but accept only Butter Ghee - Vegetable Ghee is often trans fats. 
  Ghee is very easy to make per our recipe  
  <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee & Clarified Butter</b></a>. The 
  best substitute for Ghee is Avocado Oil, which has a lightly buttery 
  flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_gheez.html"><b>Ghee</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 3 Tablespoons 
  of Tomato Paste. I prefer to add a convenient 8oz can of a very simple 
  tomato sauce, which helps make up for deficient tomatoes. My favorite 
  is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id=06>
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was titled <i>Lamb and 
  String Beans (Guisht lovia)</i>, but the ingredients list clearly 
  calls for Beef. The recipe on the previous page, <i>Lamb with Chickpeas 
  (Guisht lovia)</i>, clearly calls for Lamb cut to the same size. Both 
  recipes call for Beef Broth. The Internet knows the word Guisht only 
  from a site that basically copied these two recipes from <i>The Art 
  of Uzbek Cooking</i>, except adding a lot more tomato paste. I am 
  presuming Guisht means a type of stew which may be either Lamb or Beef.
