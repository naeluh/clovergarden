  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop the <b>GROUND BEEF</b> some to make sure it is really ground 
    thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Chop all <b>VEGIES items</b> very fine, but not to mush, they 
    should have some texture. It is allowed to use a food processor here, 
    if you are careful not to get things too fine.</li>
  <li>Separately dry pan toast <b>Cumin Seed</b> and <b>Coriander Seed</b> 
    Let cool well, then grind together all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>All Items</b> <u>Except Oil</u> and massage until 
    everything is very even and smooth. 5 minutes of massaging is 
    recommended. Form into Patties 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick and about 4 
    inches across. In frying, they will get thicker and the diameter 
    will be reduced. Let rest for an hour if you have time.</li>
  <li>Prepare all your Garnishes and Accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> over fairly high heat and fry 
    <b>Patties</b> until cooked through, but not cooked to death. 
    The outside should be quite dark, but the inside still tender 
    and moist. Move them around in the pan or they'll make a cool 
    spot under their center and not fry evenly.</li>
  <li>Serve Hot with <b>Lemon Wedges</b> and your choice of the other 
    suggested accompaniments.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ground Beef:</h3> &nbsp; I use 73% lean, and certainly not over 
  80% lean. Aside from better flavor, Central Asia is definitely not a 
  "low fat" region - but do not be distressed, the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been totally 
  discredited.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cilantro:</h3> &nbsp; That's a lot of Cilantro, but use the 
  stems too, which saves a lot of time.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Chili</h3>	&nbsp; In Pakistan and Afghanistan this might be 
  an Indian Jawala Chili, quite hot. That type of chili is hard to find 
  in North America, so here we use a Serrano, similarly hot. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garam Masala</h3> &nbsp; This spice mix is made many ways. For this 
  recipe, a Kashmir version is appropriate, but a Punjab version will 
  do fine. See our recipes <a href="iys_masalgmk1.html"><b>Garam Masala 
  - Kashmir</b></a> and <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala, 
  Punjab</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes have you fry in about 1/8 inch of 
  oil. A few specify a lightly oiled pan, and some grill the patties 
  over charcoal. I usually fry in 1/8 inch of oil - you'll need to 
  pour off the excess now and then.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Cilantro Mint Chutney</h3> &nbsp; This type of chutney is often 
  used with fried food throughout the region. See our recipe 
  <a href="ijv_cmtchny1.html"><b>Cilantro Mint Chutney</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; These patties originated in Afghanistan, but 
  are also very popular in northern Pakistan. Our recipe contains just 
  enough Egg and Flour so the patties hold together well, but not so 
  much as to dampen the flavor. Some recipes ask for a lot more of one 
  or the other. Some recipes call for about 10 oz of Red Onion rather 
  than the Scallions, but may still include a couple of Scallions. 
  The amount of Cilantro varies greatly, but most recipes us a lot. 
  Many recipes include various amounts of Pomegranate seeds, whole 
  and/or crushed to add a sour note. Some recipes include Tomato. The 
  name probably comes from the Pashto word chaprikh, meaning "flat", but 
  another theory is that it is based on a local name for a sandal.
