This is the most famous dish of Central Asia, especially in Uzbekistan. 
The traditional one pan method is prone to failure until you have years 
of experience. This recipe offers near traditional results without so 
much risk. See <a href="nmm_lmbplov1.html#08"><b>Authenticity</b></a>

<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 hrs - 25 min work)
<ol>
<li>Bone your <b>LAMB</b>. Remove membranes and nearly all fat, 
  retaining all. Refrigerate meat until needed.</li> 
<li>Put Bones, membranes and fat into a pot. Add water to cover well. 
  Bring to a boil and skim froth as it starts to boil. Cover and let 
  simmer slowly for 6 hours or more.</li>
<li>Strain, retaining all liquids and discarding solids.</li>
<li>Using your gravy separator, separate <b>Broth</b> from <b>Fat</b>, 
  <u>retaining both</u>. I then run the Broth through a very fine 
  strainer to remove debris. Refrigerate Broth and Fat until needed.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="5">
<li>Cut <b>Lamb</b> into about 1 inch chunks.</li>
<li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise about 1/8 inch 
  thick</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into sticks about 1/4 inch on a side 
  and 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
<li>Peel outer skins off whole head of <b>GARLIC</b>, leaving the cloves 
  unpeeled and the head intact. Cut off the stem end deep enough to 
  expose Garlic flesh at the ends of the cloves.</li>
<li><u>IF</u> Using: &nbsp; Crush <b>SAFRON</b> threads and soak in 2 T 
  hot water.</li>
<li>Crush <b>CUMIN SEEDS</b> fairly small, but not to powder. Mix all 
  <b>Spicing items</b>.</li>
<li>Slice <b>RED ONION</b> as thin as you can, for Garnish.</li>
  </ol> 
<b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol start="12">
<li>Wash <b>Rice</b> well so it won't be sticky. Best is to shake it 
  vigorously in a fine mesh strainer under hot running water. Drain 
  thoroughly. Set it up for cooking, in a pan or rice cooker. Add the 
  proper amount of <b>Lamb Broth</b> to cook the rice properly (see 
  <a href="nmm_lmbplov1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). <u>IF</u> using <b>Saffron</b>, it 
  and its soaking water are part of this measure, otherwise just 
  1/4 t <b>Turmeric</b>.  Add the 1/2 t <b>Salt</b>. <u>Do not</u>  
  start cooking it yet. Any left over Broth should be used instead of 
  Water for cooking the meat.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart) or similar coverable 
  vessel, heat <b>Lamb Fat</b>. Fry the <b>Lamb</b>, tumbling often 
  until lightly browned.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and <b>Carrots</b>. Fry stirring until Onions 
  are light golden. If the fond is getting too dark, go to the next 
  step right away.</li>
<li>Start your <b>Rice</b> cooking at this time. It should have 10 
   minutes standing time after cooking.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Spices mix</b>, then 2/3 cup <b>Water</b> (or Broth if 
  you have it). Embed the <b>Garlic Head</b>, cut side down. Bring to 
  a boil, cover tightly and simmer until Lamb is tender. Be careful it 
  doesn't get dry and burn. This will take 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
<li>When Lamb is tender: adjust the sauce as desired. I like a fair 
  amount of sauce for the rice.</li>
<li>Spread <b>Rice</b> on a platter (or individual plates) and spoon 
  the <b>Lamb and Sauce</b> over the center of the rice. For a platter, 
  the head of Garlic is usually placed on top, or individual cloves 
  can be distributed Garnish as desired and serve hot. For buffet, 
  instead of a platter I use an electric skillet set to "warm".</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id=01>
  <h3>Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; The lamb you buy should include bones and a 
  reasonable amount of fat, but yield 1-1/2 pounds of trimmed meat. 
  The bones and fat will also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/as_sheepc.html"><b>Lamb / Mutton Cuts</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id=02>
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; The proper rice is medium 
  grain (in Central Asia it usually comes from Russia). East Asian rice 
  is the right shape, but considered too sticky. Paella Rice is 
  considered ideal and Italian Risotto Rice is considered good. The 
  rice should finish with the grains very separate, but just a touch 
  chewy. The amount of <b>Lamb Broth</b> should be measured to achieve 
  this result (usually about 3-1/2 cups for 2 cups of Rice). The rice 
  I use is "Egypt's Best", which works very well. Some recipes allow 
  Basmati rice, but it has a rather dry mouth feel, not ideal for this 
  dish. I strongly recommend using a rice cooker, as it frees the stove 
  and makes timing less critical, as it flips to "keep warm" when 
  the rice is done.</li>
<li id=03>
  <h3>Saffron:</h3> &nbsp; This is expensive and may not be on hand, 
  so 1/4 t Turmeric is often used instead. The flavor is quite different, 
  but acceptable. In the photo example the amount of Saffron was nearly 
  1/8 t, a little more than I'd likely use again as I'd like the rice a 
  little less blazingly yellow.</li>
<li id=04>
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, 
  which are fairly hot, and 1/2 t does add significant sharpness to this 
  recipe. Use your own best judgement here. I have one recipe that 
  suggests 1 t Ajika instead, which will add more flavor. Ajika is 
  Caucasian, not Central Asia, but they probably know about it there. 
  Ajika sold around here seldom has much heat, so I'd use some Chili 
  Flake too.</li>
<li id=05>
  <h3>Lamb Fat:</h3> &nbsp; In Central Asia, guests would be insulted 
  if this dish wasn't dripping with Sheep Tail Fat. They would expect 
  an oil slick still on the plate after the Plov is eaten. A little less 
  is allowed in the more sophisticated cuisine of Samarkand. Here in 
  North America our guests would be very distressed if the dish had 
  that much fat, and we don't have Fat Tailed Sheep here anyway. Don't 
  be afraid to use a reasonable amount of fat as the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been 
  completely discredited. The amount give here is the minimum, and 
  you can add more if you want. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/as_sheepc.html"><b>Lamb / Mutton Cuts</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id=06>
  <h3>Making Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; The Zirvak (stew) will reheat fine - 
  make it ahead, making sure it isn't overcooked, and refrigerate. As 
  time to serve approaches, start cooking the rice (it needs about 30 
  minutes including rest time). I strongly recommend a rice cooker 
  which will cook the rice without attention, frees up the stove, 
  and clicks to "keep warm" when done, making timing much less 
  critical.</li>
<li id=07>
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for Coriander Seed as well 
  as Cumin Seed. A very common option would be about 2 T dried 
  <b>Barberries</b> to add a tart note. They're stirred in with the 
  Water. While fairly common here in the Western Capital of Armenia, 
  Barberries may be difficult to find elsewhere. Another common option 
  is up to 3 heads of garlic instead of just one.</li>
<li id=08>
  <h3>Authenticity:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional way to make this dish 
  is in layers, all in one pot. In the final stages, raw rice is 
  carefully spread over the Zirvak (stew), water added and boiled off 
  uncovered. Then holes are punched to the bottom, and the dish is 
  finished tightly covered. To serve, the rice layer is scooped cleanly 
  off the Zirvak and arranged on a platter, then the Zirvak is arranged 
  over the center of the rice. Sometimes the carrots are a  separate 
  layer under the rice and will be a seperate layer under the Zirvak on 
  the platter.
  <p><u>Problems</u>: &nbsp; This is a one-shot make and serve. Also, 
  success takes a lot of practice to get it right, and if the rice isn't 
  perfect, it's a fail. If it's burned at the bottom, it's a fail. The 
  cooking equipment, heat control, and amount of water or broth applied 
  must be controlled with precision, and timing is critical. Until 
  recently, only men were allowed to make plov, and they were well 
  trained by their fathers on the same equipment they would eventually 
  use. Today, many recipes just stir raw rice into the Zervak to make 
  the cooking less critical, but that isn't authentic.</p>
  <p>As mentioned above, authenticity requires it to be practically 
  swimming in Sheep Tail Fat, not the way we want it in North America. 
  The proper cooking appliance is a Kazan, a large wok-like pan with 
  a very tight fitting lid. Traditionally it is of  cast iron, but 
  most today are cast aluminum. In Uzbekistan, mostly yellow carrots 
  are used, but those are hard to find in North America where orange 
  ones dominate, but those work fine.</p></li>
