This tasty stew apparently originated in Central Asia, possibly 
Uzbekistan, but it has been widely adopted, including in Russia. It is 
not difficult to make, and reheats well.

<b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - exclusive of making Broth)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>MEAT</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise about 1/8 inch 
  thick. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse. Mix.</li>
<li>Blast <b>MILD CHILIS</b> black with your 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane Torch</b></a> and brush off 
  skins under running water (see <a href="nmm_lmbveg1.html#06">Note-6</a>). Cut into 
  narrow strips about 1 inch long and mix with Onions.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into about 3/8 inch thick drums.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in 
  cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Chop <b>HERBS</b> small and mix. Chop extra <b>Parsley</b> for 
  Garnish.</li>
<li>Grind together all <b>Spices</b> items.</li>
  </ol> 
<b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hr)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart) or similar coverable 
  vessel, heat <b>Oil</b>.  Stir in <b>Meat</b> and fry stirring often 
  over high heat until any exuded liquid has boiled off and meat is 
  lightly browned all over. If fond adhering to the pan gets too dark, 
  go to the next step immediately - chocolate is OK, black is not.</li>
<li>Remove <b>Meat</b> with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
<li>Adjust <b>Oil</b>. There should be no more than 2 Tablespoons left 
  in the pan, but there should be a little more than 1 Tablespoon.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onions mix</b> and fry stirring until Onions are 
  translucent.</li>
<li>Return <b>Meat</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Tomato Sauce</b> and  
  <b>Spices mix</b>, then stir in <b>Beef Broth</b>. Bring to a boil 
  and simmer covered until the Meat is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>After about 45 minutes, stir in <b>Carrots</b>.</li>
<li>When Meat is tender, stir in <b>Potatoes</b>. Correct liquid as 
  needed. Bring back to a boil and simmer covered until Potatoes are 
  tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Herb Mix</b> and simmer for about 
  2 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb / Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless meat trimmed of all 
  excess fat. All Zharkop recipes I've see call for Lamb, but I've seen a 
  Tovuk (Chicken) Zharkop recipe, so I figure we have some latitude. 
  In Central Asia, Lamb is low cost and plentiful, while beef is scarce 
  and dear - but its the other way around in North America. Beef is also 
  easier to prepare (less problems with fat).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mild Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "two Italian 
  peppers". Presumably these are Cubanelles (Italian Frying Peppers). 
  Those are not found here in Southern California, so we use Armenian 
  / Turkish chilis (closer to Central Asia anyway), or similar non-hot 
  Hungarians. Lacking any of those, I'd use 5 ounces of Green Anaheims, 
  core, seeds and membranes removed. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1/4 cup of 
  Tomato Paste. I prefer to add a convenient 8oz can of a very simple 
  tomato sauce. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple 
  sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beef Broth:</h3> &nbsp; If using Lamb, you could use Lamb Broth 
  instead. For recipes of this sort, a day ahead I buy meat with fat 
  and bones. I trim off the meat for the recipe and use the bones, 
  membranes and fat to make the broth. This I strain, discarding the 
  solids, and use my gravy separator to remove all the fat. For details 
  see our recipe <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - 
  General Method</b></a>.</li>
<li id=05>
  <h3>Bread:</h3> &nbsp; I have two recipes calling for quarters of 
  toasted Pita Bread (or similar) added to this soup, (but one is 
  derived from the other, so it counts as one). I have seen no other 
  recipe for, or photo of, Zharkop that includes bread, so I do not 
  use it. That makes more sense for buffet service, and bread can be 
  placed on the table.</li>
<li id=06>
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did not call for skinning 
  the chilis, but the cooking time for them is long. They dissolve into 
  the sauce and leave annoying stiff skins floating in the stew. Blasting 
  and brushing the skins takes only a few minutes, and the torch should 
  be available in every kitchen.
