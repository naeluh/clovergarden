This is the "official" Persian Rice. It always has a crispy Tahdig crust on 
the bottom. For the photo example I used a Lavash bread tahdig. Read also

<td class=top>
<p>Before getting started, chose the <a href="nsg_richel1.html#03"><b>Tahdig</b></a> you wish 
to use, and check it's ingredients. The Tahdig ingredients are <u>NOT</u> 
included in the ingredient list to the left.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs + Step-1 soaking time)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash 2 cups rice. Best way is to shake it under hot running water in a 
    fine mesh strainer. Place in a bowl and mix with 1-1/2 T <b>Salt</b> and 
    1-1/2 cups <b>Water</b>. Let soak for at least 30 minutes, but it can be 
    several hours.</li>
  <li>Place 0.45 grams of Saffron powder (that's about 2/3 of a 1/4 teaspoon 
    measure) in a small ceramic bowl. Heat water to a boil and let cool a 
    couple minutes. Pour in 3 Tablespoons and let soak until needed.</li>
  <li>Fill a pan with 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil and add at least 3 T 
    Salt (it should be salty as seawater). Don't worry about the large amount, 
    it will pour out with the water.</li>
  <li>Drain the soaked rice, but don't rinse. Pour it into the boiling water 
    and stir once. Bring it back to a boil, watching closely as it can foam 
    over. Scoop off foam that rises. When it reaches a boil, start timing. 
    At 4 minutes start testing the rice. It should still have a stiff bite 
    in the center but not at all crunchy. Boiling time can be 5 to 7 minutes, 
    depending on the rice, which should have all floated to the top when done. 
    </li>
  <li>When the rice is ready, pour into a fine mesh strainer and rinse under 
    a spray of warm water. Test the rice. If it's too salty, rinse more. Hold 
    it in the strainer until needed.</li>
  <li>Clean and dry the pan. Prepare <b>Tahdig</b> of your choice as given 
    in note <a href="nsg_richel1.html#03"><b>Tahdig</b></a>.</li>
  <li id="n7">Scatter the <b>Rice</b> over the Tahdig, making a cone shape 
    and making sure the Tahdig layer is completely covered. With the handle 
    of a wooden spoon or similar device, make several steam escape holes 
    into the rice, <u>but don't poke into the Tahdig layer</u>.</li>
  <li id="n8">Turn the heat up to medium high, cover and cook for 10 to 12 
    minutes to set the Tahdig. You can test if it's ready by taking a dab 
    of wet paper towel and touching the outside of the pot just above Tahdig 
    level. If it sizzles strongly and the water evaporates immediately, turn 
    down the heat.</li>
  <li>During this 10 minutes, melt 1-1/2 T <b>Butter or Ghee</b> and stir 
    in the remaining <b>Saffron Water</b>.      
  <li>Lift the lid, pouring any condensed water <u>outside</u> the pan. 
    Drizzle the <b>Saffron Butter mix</b> over the rice. Wrap the lid in a 
    cloth (to prevent dripping) and place it tightly on the pan. I use a disk 
    of muslin cut to overlap the edge of the pan by an inch.</li>
  <li>When the pan passes the sizzle test (<a href="nsg_richel1.html#08"><b>Step-8</b></a>), 
    cook at medium heat until steam escapes from under the lid, then place a 
    heat diffuser under the pan and turn the heat to low. Let cook for about 
    35 minutes.</li>
  <li>To help the rice slip out of the pan, put an inch of cold water in 
    the sink. place the pan for a couple of minutes, or set the pan on a cold 
    water soaked towel for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Place a dish over the pan and invert it so the rice slides out onto 
    the dish. Use a dish quite a bit larger than the pan, as the rice has 
    very little adhesion and some will scatter around when you lift the 
    pan. Depending on you Tahdig, you may want to remove it and break it or 
    cut it up to serve beside the rice. In any case, this dish should be 
    eaten right away, because the Tahdig doesn't stay crisp.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Saffron:</h3> &nbsp; Volume is after grinding. Yes, it's expensive in 
  North America, but essential for much Persian cooking (it's cheaper there). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ir_saffroz.html"><b>Saffron</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Basmati Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Iranians are <u>extremely</u> fussy about the 
  quality of their rice. Basmati is <u>always</u> used, best quality and raw 
  (NOT Sela). My current favorite is Dunan Elonga, also recommended by a very 
  experienced Iranian recipe writer. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ri_indiz.html#basmat"><b>Indian Rice</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tahdig</h3> &nbsp; This word means "bottom of the pot", and is a browned 
  layer under the rice, which end up on top when you turn it out on a serving 
  plate. Here are various ways to make it.  Note that the ingredients listed 
  for these are <u>NOT</u> included in the main ingredient list, except for 
  the Saffron Water.<p></p>
  <h4>Plain Tahdig</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>In the pan place 1-1/2 T <b>Ghee or Butter</b> and 1 T <b>Olive 
      Oil</b>. Melt the Butter over medium heat and splash the Oil around 
      so it covers the whole bottom and a bit up the sides.</li>
    <li>When the Oil starts to sizzle, pour in 3/4 T of <b>Saffron Water</b>, 
      then quickly spread in enough of the <b>Rice</b> to cover the bottom in 
      a thin layer. Pat it down fairly flat.</li>
    <li>Immediately go to <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n7"><b>Step-7</b></a> and continue,</li> 
      </ol><p></p>
  <h4>Bread Tahdig</h4>	&nbsp; 
    <br>This tahdig is often used when making in layers 
    with other ingredients, because it stops liquids from those layers from 
    getting through to the bottom of the pot.
    <ol>
    <li>Before starting to cook rice, cut <b>Lavash Bread</b> (or a large 
      wheat Tortilla if Lavash not available) to exactly fit the bottom of 
      the pot. I press in the rim of the lid to mark out the size.</li>
    <li>In the pan place 1-1/2 T <b>Ghee or Butter</b> and 1 T <b>Olive 
      Oil</b>. Melt the Butter over medium heat and splash the Oil around so 
      it covers the whole bottom and a bit up the sides.</li>
    <li>When the Oil starts to sizzle, pour in 3/4 T of <b>Saffron Water</b>, 
      place the cut <b>Bread</b> in the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Immediately go to <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n7"><b>Step-7</b></a> and continue - 
      <u>EXCEPT</u> <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n8"><b>Step-8</b></a> should be medium heat, 
      not medium high,</li>
    </ol><p></p>
  <h4>Lettuce Tahdig</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>have ready whole <b>Romaine Lettuce</b> leaves sufficient to completely 
      cover the bottom of the pot in a thin layer. Crush thick stems so they 
      lie flat.</li>
    <li>In the pan place 1-1/2 T <b>Ghee or Butter</b> and 1 T <b>Olive 
      Oil</b>. Melt the Butter over medium heat and splash the Oil around so 
      it covers the whole bottom and a bit up the sides.</li>
    <li>Place the <b>Lettuce Leaves</b> in the pot, stems to the center, and 
      pat them down flat.</li>
    <li>Pour in 3/4 T of <b>Saffron Water</b> Then Immediately go to 
      <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n7"><b>Step-7</b></a> and continue.</li>
    </ol><p></p>
  <h4>Potato Tahdig</h4>
  <br>This is one of the most loved tahdigs everywhere.
    <ol>
    <li>Slice a <b>Potato</b> in 1/4 inch slices. Russets are good, but 
      White Rose could also be used.</li>
    <li>In the pan place 1-1/2 T <b>Ghee or Butter</b> and 1 T <b>Olive 
      Oil</b>. Melt the Butter over medium heat and splash the Oil around so 
      it covers the whole bottom and a bit up the sides.</li>
    <li>When the Oil starts to sizzle, sprinkle with a little salt, then 
      arrange <b>Potato Slices</b> tightly in a single layer. Sprinkle 
      potatoes with a little <b>Salt</b> and fry until light golden, then 
      flip over to the other side.</li>
    <li>Pour 3/4 T of <b>Saffron Water</b> over the potatoes. Then Immediately 
      go to <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n7"><b>Step-7</b></a> and continue.</li>
    </ol><p></p>
  <h4>Yogurt Tahdig</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>This Tahdig is not as crisp as the others, but adds a welcome tart 
      note to the rice. In a mixing bowl, mix 3 cups of the <b>Par Boiled 
      Rice</b> with 3 T <b>Plain Greek Yogurt</b> and 1/2 t of the 
      <b>Saffron Water</b>.</li>
    <li>In the pan place 1-1/2 T <b>Ghee or Butter</b> and 1 T <b>Olive 
      Oil</b>. Melt the Butter over medium heat and splash the Oil around so 
      it covers the whole bottom and a bit up the sides.</li>
    <li>Spread the <b>Rice-Yogurt mix</b> evenly over the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
    <li>Immediately go to <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n7"><b>Step-7</b></a> and continue - 
      <u>EXCEPT</u> <a href="nsg_richel1.html#n8"><b>Step-8</b></a> should be medium heat, 
      not medium high,</li>
    </ol>
  <p></p>
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Hints:</h3> &nbsp; A non-stick pot is <u>strongly</u> recommended by 
  anyone who has been making this dish. You also need to know your stove 
  and cooking equipment intimately. Do at least one practice run before 
  doing an important presentation run. Pay very close attention to your 
  times and burner settings, and write it all down (no, you won't remember). 
  For your next run, make corrections as needed.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Persian Rice Cooker:</h3> &nbsp; Described by Naz Deravian as the 
  "secret weapon" of Iranian home cooks, the Persian Rice Cooker doesn't 
  just turn off when the rice is done as most do, but keeps on cooking 
  to make a nice crisp Tahdig at the bottom. These have a dial to set the 
  number of minutes to keep cooking after the rice is done. For details 
  see our <a href="../ke/ke_ricookz.html"><b>Rice Cooker</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Rice cooking came late to Persia, and when it 
  did, they came up with this method, different from all their neighbors.  
  Surprisingly, before the coming of the almighty Rice Cooker, this three 
  step (soak, parboil, steam) method was also used in Japan, but no formal 
  tahdig or saffron. This recipe is based on, and follows fairly closely, 
  the one by Naz Deravian in her excellent book "Bottom of the Pot".</li>
