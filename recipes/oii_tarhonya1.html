<h1 class=sz>Hungarian Dumplings <small>&amp;</small> Noodles</h1>
<br><span class=bg><i>Tarhonya, Csipetke, Galuska, T&eacute;szta 
(Noodles)</i></span>
<p>These noodles have been very important in Hungarian cuisine since 
at least the 1500s. Tarhonya are traditionally dried for storage (but 
can be used fresh), the others made fresh as needed.

<li>Sift <b>Flour</b>, mix in <b>Eggs</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Knead to 
  make a stiff dough. If it's too crumbly to form a ball add just a touch 
  of cold water. Use care, the dough needs to be be just moist enough to 
  form a ball, but not at all sticky.</li>
<li>Form into two or three balls and let rest for about 3/4 hour, covered 
  with plastic so they don't dry out.</li>
<li>Shape and cut to one of the forms shown below.</li>
<li>Cook in boiling salted water as for any pasta, but for time 
  appropriate to the shape. DO NOT depend on the old "if they float 
  they're almost done" rule - you need to sample them.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Of course, I let my big KitchenAid stand mixer and it's dough hook 
do all the heavy work, and I know just what the dough should look like 
in the bowl when it's had enough water.</p> 
<p></p>Note that Tarhonya are usually used fresh or dried, but Csipetke and 
definitely Galuska are used fresh. You can make these ahead. Par boil 
about 30 seconds in rapidly boiling water, then drain, bag and 
refrigerate. They will keep for 4 days or so and be ready for final 
cooking when needed. After the par-boil they can also be frozen. You will 
find much more about making fresh pasta on our

Pasta</b></a> page (Italy isn't far from Hungary).

<h3><u>Tarhonya</u></h3> &nbsp;  -  &nbsp; [Egg Barley, Rivilchas] 
<br>Tarhonya is a typical Hungarian pasta you can easily make fresh - or 
you can make a lot of it and dry it. Hungarian families once made tarhonya 
by the sack full in August when it would sun dry well, then used it over 
the winter. Tarhonya is often fried in butter or bacon fat until golden 
before adding to soup.
<ol>
<li>Grate dough balls on the coarse side of a grater. Don't let them pile up 
  or they may stick together - spread on a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Let dry on a towel for 1/2 hour before using, shuffling occasionally 
  for even drying.</li>
<li>Cook in plenty of salted water and give them about 7 minutes after the 
  water comes back to a boil to become tender all the way through. Strain 
  them out and tumble with a few drops of butter or olive oil to keep 
  them from sticking together.</li>
<li><b>DRIED:</b> spread out on cloth and sun dry or spread on baking sheets 
  and dry in a barely warm oven. Shuffle occasionally for even drying.</li>

<h3><u>Csipetke</u></h3>
<br>Csipetke is a fresh pasta often used in stews. Some recipes call 
for rolling the dough thin before pinching off, but I much prefer the 
Magyar campfire texture you get from pinching off the ball.
<ol>
<li>Take a dough ball and pinch off pieces smaller than a dime and pinched 
  quite thin.</li>
<li>Let dry on a towel for 1/2 hour before using, shuffling occasionally 
  for even drying.</li>
<li>Cook in plenty of salted water and give them about 10 to 15 minutes after 
  the water comes back to a boil to become tender all the way through and 
  float up to the surface.  Strain them out and tumble with a few drops of 
  olive oil to keep them from sticking together.</li>

<h3 id="galus"><u>Galuska</u></h3> &nbsp;  -  &nbsp; [Soft Dumplings]
<br>An essential dumpling for many Hungarian dishes. It is said that if 
you can't make galuska you can't cook Hungarian - but I can't see how 
anyone would be unable to make these.
<ol>
<li>Roll dough balls out to between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick and then 
  cut with the edge of a spoon or some such device to make irregular 
  pieces about 1 x  3/8 x 3/8 inch or as you like.</li>
<li>Spread out on a towel and let dry for about 1/2 hour, shuffling 
  occasionally for even drying.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil. Dump in a galuska, bring back 
  to a boil and keep at a fast simmer until they are done. This can be 
  anywhere from  30 minutes to over 1 hour depending on shape and 
  thickness. Strain them out and tumble in a bowl 
  with a little melted butter or a few drops of oil so they don't stick 
  together.

<h3><u>T&eacute;szta</u></h3>
<br>Noodles are now used in a great many Hungarian dishes, cut into many 
sizes.
<ol>
<li>Roll dough balls out as thin as you can on a floured board and let dry 
  for a little while. Slice to the desired width, which may be wide or may be 
  as narrow as you can cut it, or may be small squares.</li>
<li>Spread out on a towel or hang over a pin or wire (depending on 
  shape) and let dry for about 1/2 hour, shuffling occasionally for even 
  drying if on a towel sheet.</li>
