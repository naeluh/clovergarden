This dish combines very different textures and flavors of gizzards 
and livers. It should be served with Galuska dumplings on the side 
(though I sometimes use a suitably dense pasta).

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
<ol>
<li>Rinse <b>GIZZARDS</b> and cut into separate lobes or as desired.</li>
<li>Rinse <b>LIVERS</b> and cut into fairly large chunks.</li>
<li>Dice <b>BACON</b> about 1/4 inch.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, then quench in 
  cold water, peel and core. Cut in quarters lengthwise and slice 
  crosswise about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Cap and core <b>Pepper</b>. Cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 1 
  inch long. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hr)
<ol start="8">
<li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry <b>Onion</b>, 
  stirring until translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Gizzards</b>, <b>Water</b>, <b>Paprika</b> and 
  <b>Salt</b>. Cover and simmer over low heat for about 1-1/2 hours or 
  until Gizzards are tender to your liking. Tumble now and then and 
  check water, making sure they don't dry out.</li>
<li>When Gizzards are about done, uncover and reduce liquid to a thin 
  sauce.</li>
<li>When Gizzards are done, in a skillet, fry <b>Bacon</b> until it has 
  rendered most of it's fat. Fry the <b>Livers</b> for just 2 or 3 
  minutes, then add both to the Gizzards, along with the bacon fat.</li> 
<li>Stir in the <b>Tomato mix</b>. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer 
  for about 20 minutes until Pepper strips are tender, adding more water 
  if needed. 
<li>Serve hot with Galuska on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Gizzards:</h3> &nbsp; Here in Southern California 
  chicken gizzards are peeled, thoroughly cleaned and ready to cook. In 
  some countries this may not be the case, and you have to do that 
  yourself.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are 
  yellow-green peppers with no or nearly no heat. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium in Hungary. 
  The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid 
  to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they told 
  us to use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is 
  now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. Some 
  recipes call for Chicken Fat, which may also be traditional, but 
  many recipes published in English call for butter, which is not 
  traditional. Some recent recipes call for a mix of butter and oil, 
  or just oil. Use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or, better, Avocado oil 
  for richer flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian sweet paprika, not 
  that sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets. Real 
  paprika has real flavor and a more intense red color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Galuska:</h3> &nbsp; These are egg noodle dumplings 
  which are very easy to make, and considered an essential side dish 
  for this recipe. They should be fully cooked and tumbled with a little 
  melted butter. See our recipe 
  <a href="oii_tarhonya1.html"><b>Hungarian Fresh Dumplings</b></a>.
