<p>This recipe is compiled from several authoritative sources, but with 
boneless chunks rather than whole joints (see <a href="omc_chkpprk1.html#01">
<b>Note-1</b></a>).
</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into the size chunks appropriate for how you will be 
  serving it (see <a href="omc_chkpprk1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). 1-1/2 inch or so is usually 
  good for boneless meat.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, then quench in 
  cold water, peel and core. Cut in quarters lengthwise and slice 
  crosswise about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Use your propane torch to char the skin of the <b>PEPPER</b> and 
  wipe it off under running water. This is to prevent annoying curls of 
  skin in the sauce.</li>
<li>Cap and core <b>Pepper</b>. Cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 1 
  inch long. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Let <b>Sour Cream</b> come to room temperature in a wide bowl.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol start="7">
<li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry <b>Onion</b> 
  stirring until translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>, tumbling frequently until all raw color is 
  gone, any exuded liquid has evaporated and the chicken starts to fry.
  If using whole or half bone-in joints you will probably have to do this 
  in batches - then transfer everything to a deep pot.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Paprika</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Tomato mix</b> and 
  <b>Stock</b> (stock should about half cover chicken). Cover and simmer 
  for about 30 minutes or until chicken is tender, tumbling every now and 
  then.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Flour</b> (if used) thoroughly into the <b>Sour Cream</b>. 
  Stir a couple tablespoons of the sauce from the chicken, then stir the 
  <b>Sour Cream mix</b> into the chicken.</li>
<li>Adjust liquid as needed to get a fairly loose sauce, but one that 
  will coat the chicken. Check salt. If Flour was used it must simmer 
  slowly another 5 minutes or so to remove the raw taste of the flour, 
  otherwise, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve hot. This is usually served with some chicken on a plate, 
  some sauce poured over, Galuska on the side and Cucumber Salad 
  in a separate bowl.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless, preferably 
  thigh/leg meat. Most recipes call for a whole chicken, which would be 
  about 4 pounds, cut up into serving pieces.  I find skinless, boneless 
  easier to cook and much better for buffet service. It can also be more 
  equitably divided at the family table. Skin-on may provide flavor from 
  the skin, but I get my skin flavor from the stock, which is always made 
  including the skins stripped off the thighs I use. Thigh and leg meat 
  will give you far better flavor and texture than breast meat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium in Hungary. 
  The American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid 
  to use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they told 
  us to use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is 
  now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. Some recipes 
  call for Chicken Fat, which may also be traditional, but many recipes 
  published in English call for butter, which is not traditional. Some 
  recent recipes call for a mix of butter and oil, or just oil - not 
  traditional but some may prefer this. Use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), 
  or, better, Avocado oil for richer flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers with 
  no or nearly no heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper></b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian paprika, not that red 
  sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets. Real paprika has 
  real flavor and a more intense red color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; The flour makes for more and thicker sauce, but 
  less intense in flavor. Some recipes do not use flour.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Galuska:</h3> &nbsp; These are egg noodle dumplings which are very 
  easy to make, and considered as an essential side dish for this recipe. 
  These can be made ahead. See our recipe <a href="oii_tarhonya1.html">
  <b>Hungarian Fresh Dumplings</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Cucumber Salad:</h3> &nbsp; A simple salad of thin sliced 
  cucumbers with a very simple dressing, considered an essential side 
  dish for this recipe. These can be made ahead. See our recipe 
  <a href="ogv_cuke1.html"><b>Hungarian Cucumber Salad</b></a>.</li>
