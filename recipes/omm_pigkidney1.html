  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>KIDNEYS</b> in <b>Milk</b> or <b>Salted Water</b> 1 hour. 
    Discard the liquid. Remove any membranes, any obvious plumbing and 
    as much fat as possible. Cut the kidneys into 1/2" to 3/4" dice. 
    For method see our <a href="../ingred/ap_kidneyz.html">
    <b>Pork Kidneys</b></a> page.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Soften <b>Butter</b> and mix thoroughly with <b>Flour</b> to make 
    an uncooked roux.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a large saut&eacute; pan or stew pot and fry 
    <b>Onion</b> stirring until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Kidneys</b> and sprinkle with <b>Paprika</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring over high heat for a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Crush <b>Mace</b> and 
    stir in (not too much, it should be definite but not overwhelming). 
    Cover and simmer slowly until kidneys are firm but not hard, about 
    30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in as much of the <b>Butter roux</b> as needed for the 
    thickness you desire. The whole amount gives the gravy consistency shown 
    in the photo, use less for a stew to float dumplings in. Cook stirring 
    until stew is thickened.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Pepper</b> to taste and serve with the desired 
    accompaniments.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; Probably not found in your local 
  supermarket, but common in markets serving an Asia, Latin American, 
  or Eastern European community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_kidneyz.html"><b>Pork Kidneys</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it isn't Hungarian. 
  Not to worry, it isn't nearly as bad for you as the deadly trans fats 
  you were urged to use instead - and you survived those (we hope) - but 
  if you must you can use non-virgin olive oil or Avocado oil. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Use real Hungarian sweet paprika, infinitely 
  superior to the flavorless red sawdust sold in the supers. Sweet 
  paprika is now most used for cooking, hot (well, <i>they</i> call it 
  hot, anyway) is often a table condiment, but originally <u>all</u> 
  Hungarian Paprika was hot.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; these would officially be hot yellow 
  Hungarian or banana chilis, but other varieties work too. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
