<p>This is an excellent tasty stew with plenty of pork. Myself, I like it 
also without the sour cream, but that just wouldn't be Hungarian, now, 
would it?</p>

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>PORK</b> of excess fat and cut into strips about 2 inches 
  long and 1/4 inch on each side.</li>
<li>Cut the <b>BACON</b> into dice about 1/4 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise, then slice thin crosswise.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold water, 
  peel and cut into chunks about 1/2 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Char the skins of the <b>PEPPERS</b> with your 
<a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush them 
off under running water (this prevents annoying curls of skin floating 
in the stew). Core and cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide by 1 inch 
long. Mix with the Tomatoes.</li>
</ol> 
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="5">
<li>In a well seasoned iron skillet, heat <b>Lard</b> and fry 
  <b>Bacon</b> until light golden. Remove to a heavy bottomed stew pot or 
  spacious saut&eacute; pan leaving as much fat in the skillet as 
  possible.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Pork</b> in batches until lightly browned on all sides. Place 
  each batch in the pan with the Bacon leaving as much fat behind as 
  possible.</li>
<li>Over moderate heat fry <b>Onions</b> until just starting to color. 
  Pour all into the pan with the Pork.</li>
<li>Pour 1/2 c <b>Water</b> into the skillet, bring to a boil and scrape 
  up the fond adhering to the pan, then pour into the pot.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Paprika</b> and <b>Salt</b> into the pot.</li>
<li>Stir in enough <b>Water</b> to cover halfway up the contents. Bring 
  pot to a boil, then simmer covered over low heat for 45 minutes, 
  stirring a couple of times. Keep the water level about 1/2 way up on 
  the ingredients.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b> and simmer another 20 minutes. This should 
  end up with only a little liquid, so do some of the simmering uncovered 
  if necessary.</li>
<li>Meanwhile set your <b>Sour Cream</b> out to warm to room temperature and 
  boil your Galuska.</li>
<li>When nearly ready to serve, let it cool just a bit, then stir 2 T of 
  the sauce into the <b>Sour Cream</b>, then stir the Sour Cream mix 
  back into the pot. Bring it back just to a simmer for a couple of 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Put some <b>Galuska</b> at one side of each shallow bowl or deep plate, 
  and spoon Tok&aacute;ny to fill the rest.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with all excess fat removed. 
  Shoulder is preferred but leg (fresh ham) will do just fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; This should be slab bacon (available from 
  European delis).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers with 
  no or nearly no heat. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it just isn't 
  Hungarian. Not to worry, lard it isn't nearly as bad for you as the 
  deadly trans fats you were told to use instead - and you survived those 
  (we hope) - but if you must, you can use non-virgin Olive Oil, or 
  better, Avocado Oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian sweet paprika, not that 
  sawdust flavored stuff from the supermarket. The real thing has better 
  flavor and more intense color.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Galuska:</h3> &nbsp; These are home made (easy to make) dumplings. 
  See <a href="oii_tarhonya1.html"><b>Hungarian Fresh Dumplings</b></a> 
  for the recipe and method. This stew can also be served with mashed 
  potatoes if desired.</li>
