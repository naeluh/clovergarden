<p>Formerly tripe was cheap but difficult to prepare. Today we buy it 
ready to cook.</p>

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Prepare and precook the <b>TRIPE</b>.
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse the tripe thoroughly and remove any fat that may be attached 
    to it.</li>
  <li>Place the tripe in a pot with cold water to cover. Add some 
    <b>Citric Acid</b> or <b>Lemon Juice</b> to the water along with a 
    teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil for a few minutes, then drain and 
    rinse the tripe.</li>
  <li>With fresh water, acid and salt, repeat the above step.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot. Return the tripe to the pot and add fresh cold water 
    to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender but with some bite 
    left as it will be cooked more in the recipe. This cooking will 
    take about 1-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li>Cut the tripe into strips a little less than 1/2 inch wide and 
    about 2 inches long.</li>
  </ol>
<li>Dice <b>BACON</b> medium.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, then quench in 
  cold water, peel and core. Cut in quarters lengthwise and slice 
  crosswise about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Use your propane torch to char the skin of the <b>PEPPER</b> and 
  wipe it off under running water. This is to prevent annoying curls of 
  skin in the sauce.</li>
<li>Cap and core <b>Pepper</b>. Cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 1 
  inch long. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Crush or grind <b>Cumin</b> and mix with Tomatoes, along with 
  <b>Paprika</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="7">

<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Lard</b> and fry <b>Bacon</b> 
  stirring until it is lightly browned. Scoop <b>Bacon</b> out with a 
  slotted spoon (the cook gets to eat the bacon bits).</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>, 1/4 cup <b>Water</b> and <b>Bay 
  Leaves</b>. Cover and simmer slowly for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tripe</b>, <b>Marjoram</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> 
  and 1/2 c <b>Water</b> Cover and simmer until Tripe is tender. You 
  should be able to break up the strips in your mouth but it should 
  not be mushy.</li>
<li>Serve hot with Csipetke or Galuska on the side. <b>Sour Cream</b> 
  can also be served as a side but is not required.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; Blanket or Honeycomb Tripe will work, though 
  honeycomb will hold the sauce better (and is more expensive). For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Tripe</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it isn't Hungarian. 
  Not to worry, Lard isn't nearly as bad as the deadly trans fats we were 
  urged to use instead - and you survived those (we hope). If you really 
  must, you can use non-virgin olive oil, or better, Avocado oil which is 
  richer. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html">
  <b>Lard</b></a> Page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers with 
  no or nearly no heat. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian paprika, not that 
  sawdust flavored stuff they sell in the supermarkets. Real paprika has 
  real flavor and a more intense red color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Csipetke</h3> and <h3>Galuska</h3>: &nbsp; these are easily made 
  egg noodle dumplings. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="oii_tarhonya1.html"><b>Hungarian Fresh Dumplings</b></a>.
