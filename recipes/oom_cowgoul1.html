Basic Hungarian Guly&aacute;s, not quite what most Americans expect. 
Bogr&aacute;cs Guly&aacute;s (Cauldron Guly&aacute;s) is the same thing, 
but cooked as a thin stew rather than soup.

<p>This Goulash is delicious just the way it is, but <a href="oom_cowgoul1.html#07">
<b>Note-7</b></a> includes notes and some common variations.</p>

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into cubes 1 inch to 
  1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
<li>Char <b>PEPPERS</b> with your propane torch and brush the skin off 
  under cold running water (prevents annoying curls of skin in the soup). 
  Cut into strips about 1/2 inch by 1-1/2 inches.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch dice. Keep in cold water 
  acidulated with a little citric acid or lemon juice until needed.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly. Crush <b>Caraway Seeds</b> moderately,  
  Mix all <b>Seasoning Items</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a well seasoned iron skillet, heat <b>Lard</b>. Bring it up very 
  hot, but not to smoking. Fry <b>Beef</b> in batches until lightly 
  browned on all sides. Place each batch in a heavy bottomed stew pot 
  as it is finished.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent (you should not need more lard). 
  Pour all into the stew pot.</li>
<li>Pour 1/2 c of the <b>Beef Stock</b> into the skillet, bring to a 
  simmer for a few minutes and scrape up the fond adhering to the skillet. 
  Pour it into the stew pot along along with the rest of the 
  <b>Beef Stock</b>.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>, Bring to a boil, then simmer very slowly 
  for about 1-1/2 hours to 2 hours or as needed to bring the meat almost 
  tender, but not so tender it falls apart.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Peppers</b> and simmer another 10 minutes.</li> 
<li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, adjust liquid with more stock if needed, and 
  cook another 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.</li>
<li>Stir in 1/2 T more <b>Paprika</b>. If using <b>Csipetke</b>, stir 
  them in a few minutes before taking off the heat, or cook them 
  separately and pass in a bowl at the table. Butter them lightly so they 
  don't stick together.</li>
<li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with all excess 
  fat removed. Shank is traditional (and will provide the best flavor), 
  but Round or Chuck roasts will serve. Avoid tender cuts which fall 
  apart and lack flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers with 
  no or nearly no heat. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with cooked beyond the minimum. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian paprika - not that 
  red sawdust they sell in the supermarkets. The first 1/2 T can be Hot 
  Paprika if you like, the second is added at the end and should be 
  sweet, both for flavor and color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it isn't really 
  Hungarian. Not to worry, lard isn't nearly as bad for you as the 
  deadly trans fats you were told to use instead - and you survived 
  those (we hope). If you really must, you can use non-virgin olive oil, 
  or better, Avocado oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> Page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Csipetke:</h3> &nbsp; This item is optional. These are fresh hand 
  pinched noodles, easy to make. See our recipe for 
  <a href="oii_tarhonya1.html"><b>Csipetke</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Beef should dominate, but 
  a mix of various meats (pork, lamb, wild boar, venison, etc.) is 
  sometimes used. Traditionally Guly&aacute;s does not include tomatoes, 
  but tomatoes have been sneaking in - the amount shouldn't be enough to 
  be a dominant flavor. Most recipes include peppers, and often some 
  hot peppers too. Carrots are a common addition.
  <ul>
  <li><i>Kolozsv&aacute;ri Guly&aacute;s:</i> &nbsp; Reduce potatoes to 
    1-1/2 #. Shred about 1-1/4 # cabbage and stir in about 10 minutes 
    after the potatoes. Omit Csipetke.</li>
  <li><i>Szerb Guly&aacute;s:</i> &nbsp; Same as regular cabbage (above) 
    but use Savoy Cabbage.</li>
  <li><i>Szegedi Guly&aacute;s:</i> &nbsp; Reduce potatoes to 1-1/2 #. 
    Add 2 cups of prepared vegetables, composed of carrots cut into 1/2 
    inch slices, Kohlrabi cut into 1/2 inch dice and green beans cut 
    about 1 inch long. Parboil the vegetables in advance and add 20 
    minutes after potatoes. Include Csipetke.</li>
    </ul>
