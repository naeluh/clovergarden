<p>This goulash is excellent if you like sauerkraut, as most Hungarians 
do, and it's a fairly light stew, good for warmer days.</p>
<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into cubes 1 inch to 
  1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
<li>Char <b>PEPPERS</b> with your propane torch and brush the skin off 
  under cold running water (prevents annoying curls of skin in the stew). 
  Cut into strips about 1/2 inch by 1 inches.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch chunks. Keep in cold 
  water acidulated with a little citric acid or lemon juice until needed.
  </li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly. Crush <b>Caraway Seeds</b> moderately,  
  Mix all <b>Seasoning Items</b>.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Sauerkraut</b> and squeeze out remaining liquid, but keep 
  some liquid in case you need to adjust sourness when the stew is done.
  </li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a well seasoned iron skillet, heat <b>Lard</b>. Bring it up very 
  hot, but not to smoking. Fry <b>Beef</b> in batches until lightly 
  browned on all sides. Place each batch in a heavy bottomed stew pot 
  as it is finished.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent (add more lard if needed). Pour 
  all into the stew pot.</li>
<li>Pour 1/2 c of the <b>Beef Stock</b> into the skillet, bring to a boil 
  and scrape up the fond adhering to the skillet. Pour it into the stew 
  pot along along with the rest of the <b>Beef Stock</b>.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>, Bring to a boil, then simmer very slowly 
  for about 1-1/2 hours or as needed to bring the meat almost tender.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Peppers</b> and <b>Sauerkraut</b>. Simmer another 45 
  minutes.</li> 
<li>Meanwhile: Set <b>Sour Cream</b> out to come to room temperature and 
  boil <b>Potatoes</b> until tender.</li>
<li>Serve hot with Potatoes on the side. Sour Cream can be mixed in 
  or served on top as you prefer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with all excess fat removed. 
  Shank is traditional (and will provide the best flavor), but Round or 
  Chuck roasts will serve. Avoid tender cuts which fall apart and lack 
  flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers 
  with no or nearly no heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in 
  recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly 
  turn to mush cooked longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian paprika - not that red 
  sawdust they sell in the supermarkets. The first 1/2 T can be Hot 
  Paprika if you like, the second is added at the end and should be 
  sweet, both for flavor and color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> A lot depends on the quality of the sauerkraut. 
  Choose one that's fresh, crisp, sharp and tastes good right out of the 
  jar or bag. I've had good results with Vitarol brand and some other 
  Polish sauerkrauts. Alas, Meter's Wisconsin Kraut is no longer 
  available.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it isn't really 
  Hungarian. Not to worry, lard isn't nearly as bad for you as the 
  deadly trans fats you were told to use instead - and you survived 
  those (we hope). If you really must, you can use non-virgin olive oil, 
  or better, Avocado oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> Page.</li>
