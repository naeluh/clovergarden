In Hungary this is served as a soup before the main course. In North 
America it's served as a dessert. There are many variations 
(see <a href="oou_cherrys1.html#03">Note-3</a>) and no official "right way".

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol>
<li>Wash <b>CHERRIES</b>, stem and pit them, retaining all juice. A good 
  cherry pitter works well here.</li>
<li>Grate <b>ZEST</b> (yellow only) from 1/2 <b>LEMON</b>.</li> 
<li>Mix all <b>Broth items</b> in a non-reactive pot. Bring to a simmer 
  for about 5 minutes. Taste for flavor and adjust if needed.</li> 
<li>Stir <b>Cherries</b> into <b>Broth</b> and simmer for about 5 minutes.
</li>
<li>Stir <b>Flour</b> into <b>Sour Cream</b> and whip thoroughly to blend. 
  Slowly spoon about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the sour cream, stirring 
  as you add, then stir the mix into the soup pot. Bring to a simmer and 
  simmer until it thickens just a bit, about another 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Chill soup thoroughly, keeping it closely covered to keep it from 
  skinning over.</li>
<li>Serve chilled. You can garnish with a dollop of whipped cream or pass 
  additional sour cream on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sour Cherries:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh or frozen - weight is <u>after 
  pitting</u>. For fresh cherries Expect 1-1/4 pounds to yield 1 pound 
  after stemming and pitting - and perhaps add a bit more for pilfering.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Regular granulated sugar is most commonly used. 
  I've cut it back to 1/2 cup. Most Hungarian recipes would use about 
  3/4 cup but I like it less sweet and more fruity, or you could go 2/3 
  cup as a compromise.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Variations:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Sherry:</b> &nbsp; Some add a couple tablespoons of dry sherry 
    right at the end of cooking, and I follow this practice.</li>
  <li><b>Cream:</b> &nbsp; Some Hungarians use regular heavy cream rather 
    than sour cream and may adjust the sourness with lemon juice. They may 
    also use more cinnamon.</li>
  <li><b>Cherries, Morello:</b> &nbsp; Quite a few recipes (particularly 
    ones written in North America) specify morello cherries from jars. 
    Some reserve the syrup for beverages, but Saveur magazine (#112) uses 
    the syrup along with the cherries and skips the sugar.</li>
  <li><b>Cherries, Sweet:</b> &nbsp; If no other are available sweet 
    cherries can be used, preferably with some cherry juice added, and 
    adjust the sourness to taste with lemon juice.</li>
  <li><b>Thickener:</b> &nbsp; Some use a slurry of Arrowroot and water 
    to thicken the soup instead of the traditional flour. Not too much, 
    the soup should be quite "soupy".</li>
  <li><b>Fruit:</b> &nbsp; Other sour fruit are used for this soup 
    instead of cherries, particularly Black Currants, Rhubarb and 
    Gooseberries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
