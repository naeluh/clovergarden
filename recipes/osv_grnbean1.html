<p>If you really need it ol vegetarian, use avocado oil in place of lard 
- it's the richest of the oils. For my modifications see <a href="osv_grnbean1.html#02">
<b>Note-2</b></a> and <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/03"><b>Note-3</b></a> for an optional 
method.</p>

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Cook <b>RICE</b> in lightly salted water to cover for just 10 
  minutes to partially cook it. Drain and set aside.</li>
<li>Tip and tail <b>BEANS</b>. Cut into 1 inch lengths.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
<li>Let <b>Sour Cream</b> come to room temperature in a wide bowl.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Lard</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> until 
  translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Beans</b>, <b>Parsley</b>, <b>Paprika</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
  Fry stirring constantly for 3 minutes </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Water</b>. Cover and simmer slowly for 
  about 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Rice</b> and simmer until it is finished cooking - 
  <u>Caution</u>: you'll probably need to add water here, so watch it 
  carefully.</li>
<li>Stir about 1/4 cup of the <b>Bean mix</b> into the <b>Sour Cream</b>, 
  Then stir all the Sour Cream into the pan until well distributed. 
  Simmer for 2 minutes more and serve.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li  id="01">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the frying medium of Hungary - Hungarians 
  use almost no oil. The American Heart Association so villainized lard 
  for so long Americans are afraid to use it, but it's not nearly as 
  dangerous as the trans fats they told you to use instead. It has a 
  better health profile than butter, and is now increasingly used by 
  top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or, better, 
  Avocado oil.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I have cut the amount of lard from 1/2 cup in 
  the pattern recipe to 1/3 cup, though it could probably go to 1/4 cup 
  easily. More seriously, I have drastically reduced the simmering time 
  from 45 minutes to 25 minutes. The European propensity to cook 
  vegetables to death is offensive to California culinary culture. There 
  is hope though, even the worst offenders, the Germans and English, are 
  starting to learn better.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Alternate:</h3> &nbsp; By the given method, the rice pretty 
  much breaks up and becomes part of the sauce. If that's not the effect 
  you want, cook the rice completely your usual way and stir it in with the 
  Sour Cream. This can also be a "do-ahead" strategy.</li>
