Pronounced <i>LEH-choh</i>, this delicious preparation is a basic 
Hungarian recipe. It is made fresh as a side dish or light main dish, 
used as an ingredient in recipes.

In the home this recipe is often canned in season for use in the winter, 
or can be frozen. See also <a href="osv_lecso1.html#04"><b>Variations</b></a>. If you 
must have it vegetarian or kosher, I suggest Avocado oil in place of 
Bacon Fat - not at all the same, but such deprivation is your own 
choice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Hungarian Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; These are long yellow-green peppers 
  with almost no heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Peppers</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; For Hungarian recipes, chunks or 
  blocks of bacon are presumed. I have also used a good brand of "ends 
  and pieces", which are thick enough to dice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Paprika</h3> &nbsp; Please, Please, use real 
  Hungarian Sweet Paprika, not that sawdust flavored stuff they sell in 
  the supermarkets. Hungarian has much better flavor and a much more 
  intense red color.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Lesc&oacute; is also 
  made from ripe (orange or red) sweet peppers, and sometimes hotter 
  peppers (or a mix). 	For a more substantial dish smoked sausage 
  (similar to Polish kielbasa) or frankfurters are sliced about 1/4 inch 
  thick added for the last 10 minutes or so. It may be served with eggs 
  mixed in at the end, or topped with a fried egg.	Today, Lesc&oacute; 
  is sometimes made with oil, even in Hungary. I suggest Avocado oil for 
  its richness.</li>
