These stuffed eggs are a little unusual, but the flavors work together 
well. It's easy to make and excellent for buffet or zakusky table.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hr - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>EGGS</b> in a saucepan with cold water to cover by about 
    1/2 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat for 1 minute, then turn 
    off the heat and let them sit covered until you can poke your finger 
    into     the water. Peel them under cold running water and chill 
    them.</li>
  <li>Slice cold <b>Eggs</b> in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks.
  </li>
  <li>Chop <b>LIVERS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> until just translucent. 
    Stir in <b>Livers</b> and fry until they've lost their raw color.</li>
  <li>Chop together <b>Onion mix</b> and <b>Yolks</b> until very fine. 
    Work in <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b>, <b>Sour Cream</b> and 
    <b>Mayonnaise</b>. Check seasoning to taste.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Stuffing</b> into a pastry bag with a plain round nozzle 
    and pipe into egg halves.</li>
  <li>If you need to hold the finished eggs for awhile before serving, 
    even overnight, see <a href="pad_egstfc1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chill well in the refrigerator. Serve cold or cool, garnished 
    as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Shallots could also be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sour Cream &amp;/or Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; This was not called 
  for in the pattern recipe, which called for 1/2 t vinegar instead. I 
  added this (similar to other Ukranian recipes) to make the stuffing 
  soft enough to be piped through a pastry bag - by far the easiest, 
  neatest, and fastest way to fill eggs. The pattern recipe was posted 
  by Alan Leonetti, who said it was the way his maternal grandmother 
  made these in Smela Gubernia, Cherkassy, Ukraine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Holding Stuffed Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Get a stack 
  of 8 x 8 inch clear plastic clamshells with hinged lids from a 
  restaurant supply (see <a href="pad_egstfc1x.html#clam">
  <b>Clamshell</b></a>). I get them from Smart &amp; Final. These will 
  neatly hold 12 stuffed egg halves per clamshell - but they are so 
  flimsy they invite disaster (trust me). Nest two clamshells. Arrange 
  the eggs, then close and snap the lid of the inner clamshell. use 
  scissors to cut off the lid of the outer clamshell (it won't snap 
  securely). Refrigerate level.</li>
