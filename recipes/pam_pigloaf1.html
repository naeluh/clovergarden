An fine appetizer to serve with condiments. Many Americans shrink at 
eating pig feet. Fine with we who love them - it keeps the price 
low.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 1-1/4 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> and <b>HOCKS</b>. Examine feet for any hairs. 
    If there are some, blast them off with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Feet</b> and <b>Hocks</b> snuggly into a pot. You'll need at 
    least an 8 quart pot here, as they will expand some.  Fill with enough 
    water to cover well and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
  <li>When the pot comes to a full boil, let boil 4 minutes, then pour it 
    all out into the sink.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot. Rinse the <b>Feet</b> and <b>Hocks</b>, remove any 
    loose bones and pack back into the pot. Fill with water to cover and 
    bring back to a full boil, then turn down to a simmer and simmer for 
    3 hours.</li>
  <li>While the pot is coming to a boil, chop <b>ONIONS</b> medium. Put in 
    a skillet with <b>Oil</b> and fry stirring until light golden. Scrape 
    into the pot.</li>
  <li>Chop  <b>CELERY</b> coarse, Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> very coarse. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b>, slice <b>GINGER</b> thin. Add all to the pot along 
    with <b>Peppercorns</b>, <b>Allspice</b>, <b>Bay Leaves</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>When the pot has simmered 3 hours, use tongs to fish out all the 
    <b>Feet</b> and <b>Hocks</b>.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Liquid</b> and use your gravy separator to remove all the 
    fat. Put back on the stove (in a smaller pot) and bring to a high 
    simmer to reduce to about 2/3 its volume.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, debone <b>Feet</b> and <b>Hocks</b>. There is no 
    delicate way to do this, just get your hands into the job and get it 
    done. Try to get all the tiny bones out because they can interfere 
    with slicing your 
    loaf.</li>
  <li>Grease a 7 inch by 11 inch baking dish well. Break or cut up the 
    meat into largish chunks and pack it into the baking dish.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat under the liquid and stir in <b>Vinegar</b>. Check 
    for <b>Salt</b> and adjust if needed. &nbsp; <b>WARNING:</b> &nbsp; 
    <u>Do Not</u> add salt with the liquid boiling. It will foam up 
    almost explosively and flood your stove with sticky liquid.</li>
  <li>Pour still warm <b>Liquid</b> into the baking dish until nearly up 
    to the rim of the dish. Let cool thoroughly. Excess liquid can be 
    used in sauces.</li>
  <li>When fully cool, slip into the refrigerator where it will quickly 
    gel solid. Let it soak in the fridge for a few hours to make sure 
    it's gelled all the way through.</li> 
  <li>If you greased the dish well, you should have no trouble turning 
    the loaf out on to your cutting board.</li>
  <li>Serve sliced as a cold appetizer, along with mustard and 
  horseradish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; These should be fresh as 
  sold in North America, not salted as sold in Europe. Those would have to 
  be soaked overnight. Have the meat man  cut them in half lengthwise. If 
  already cut cut both ways into 4 or 6  pieces, that is fine too. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hocks:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh, not smoked. Fresh hocks are not common 
  in supermarket meat cases, but are easily available in markets serving 
  an ethnic population (except Jewish or Muslim, of course). For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ap_hockz.html"><b>Pork Hocks</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Cider Vinegar is good here, (or most others).
