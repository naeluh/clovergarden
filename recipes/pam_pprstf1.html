Stuffed peppers (and other stuffed things) are very popular in Ukraine.
These are best warm, but are still very good at room temperature - but 
don't serve too cold.

<p>If the peppers you use are longish, they will slice quite nicely after 
cooking. Use your imagination on the serving.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Cap and seed <b>PEPPERS</b>.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>BEEF</b>. Chop it some to make sure it isn't stringy.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Chop <b>CARROT</b> fine. Mix with Beef.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Chop <b>DILL</b> fine. Mix thoroughly 
    with Beef, along with <b>Rice</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stuff <b>Peppers</b>. You can stuff them quite full as there is 
    little rice, and the tops are open.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6"> 
  <li>Select a coverable pan in which the peppers can all be stood 
    upright.</li>
  <li>In the selected pan, melt the butter and stir in the 
    <b>Tomato Paste</b> for about 2 minutes until well mixed with the 
    butter. Take off heat.</li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Peppers</b> in the pan.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Broth</b> to a boil. Pour as much as is needed into the 
    pan to come near the top of the shortest pepper. Cover the pan 
    tightly and simmer slowly for 30 minutes or until rice is cooked.
    </li>
  <li>Remove <b>Peppers</b> from the Broth and arrange in a bowl, with 
    just a little of the broth. Garnish generously with <b>Sour 
    Cream</b>, or serve Sour Cream on the side, depending on the shape 
    and size of your peppers and your chosen presentation. Also see 
    <a href="pam_pprstf1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; You will need enough peppers to hold 2 cups 
  of stuffing. Any rather small sweet peppers that you can stand upright 
  will do fine, preferably in an assortment of colors. The ones in the 
  photo were a bit unruly due to being small and pointy (I cut a little 
  of the points off most of them so they would stand, if packed fairly 
  tightly - I used a big chunk of daikon radish to fill excess space 
  in the pan).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; The beef should not be too lean. If using store 
  bought ground beef, don't get the leanest. I use 70%, ground beef, 
  but 80% will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; A meat broth is preferred, but even plain water 
  works fine. <u>Do not discard the broth</u>. Even if you used just 
  water, it will be very flavorful and a fine addition to your next 
  tomato sauce.</li>
