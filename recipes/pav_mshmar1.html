Next to these, the jarred marinated mushrooms from the grocery stand 
as pale ghosts. 2 pounds of mushrooms will yield a little over 1 
pound marinated.

<ol>
  <li>Clean <b>MUSHROOMS</b> as needed. Trim stems flush with bottoms.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Place the <b>Mushrooms</b> in a stainless or enameled saucepan 
    (around 5 quarts). Pour over, all Marinade items (yes, that's enough 
    liquid, the 'shrooms will shrink <u>a lot</u>, and exude some 
    additional liquid.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil, then turn to a high simmer. Stir up the 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> often until they are all down to the liquid level. 
    Continue to stir them up now and then until they have simmered a 
    total of 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let the <b>Mushrooms</b> cool in the Marinade. Package them with 
    some of the Onions and Spices and Marinade to cover. In a sealed 
    sterile container, they will be good for at least a week. They are 
    ready to eat right away, but will improve with a day or more rest in 
    the marinade.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> Small white button mushrooms that are still closed 
  (gills not exposed) work well. You can also use Crimini mushrooms for 
  a slightly more intense flavor, or others that may be available. If 
  they are larger than about 1-3/4 inch, cut them in half.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Strict vegans should be aware that Mushrooms 
  are far more closely related to Animals than to Plants, and their 
  underground fibers are thought by scientists to act as an Internet for 
  plant communications. Yes, plants communicate.</li>
