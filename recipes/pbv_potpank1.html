<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> thin and chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGG</b> lightly.
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and grate on the coarse side of a box grater 
     or with a similar disk or drum. Squeeze out as much liquid as you 
     can and immediately mix in <b>Onions</b>, <b>Egg</b>, <b>Flour</b> 
     and <b>Salt</b>. At this point you can break for just a few minutes 
     if you need to.</li>
  <li>In a large heavy skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> about 1/16 inch deep over 
    moderate heat. For each pancake spoon in 1-1/2 oz of the <b>Potato 
    mix</b> (I use a 1-1/2 ounce restaurant ladle), then flatten to about 
    1/4 inch thick and shape them as needed.</li>
  <li> When browned on one side (watch the edges for a hint, and stiffness 
    when moved), turn and fry the other side. Watch your oil making sure 
    it doesn't get too hot and smoke, and add more as needed - there must 
    be liquid oil in the pan.</li>
  <li>Remove from the pan and interleave with paper towels to absorb excess 
    oil.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with condiments and toppings of your choice. They may be 
    eaten topped with sour cream, apple sauce, horseradish, mustard, 
    preserves or just plain salt (my favorite). They can be reheated in 
    the oven if need be.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Russets are the potatoes you want to use. 
  They're relatively dry, fry well and cook up tender in a very short 
  time. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard or Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the best frying medium, as used 
  in Poland and the Baltic region. It has less sticking problem and 
  splatters a lot less than oil - but - if you're calling these "Latkes", 
  that's probably forbidden. Olive Oil (Pomace or Pure Olive Oil, not 
  Virgin) works particularly well here and is healthy, or Avocado oil 
  (even better and just as healthy). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page. 
  and our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page (Lard 
  isn't nearly as dangerous as you've been told).</li>
<li id="03"><b>Names &amp; Variations:</b> &nbsp; Placki, Kartoflane 
  (Polish); Latkes (Yiddish); Levivot (Hebrew); Deruny (Ukraine); 
  Draniki (Russia); Reiberdatschi, Kartoffelpuffer (Germany); Rarakor, 
  Raggmunk (Sweden). Some recipes call for the onion, others do not.</li>
<li id="04"><b>Method:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>First realize this is going to make a mess. Cover your floor around 
    the stove with newspapers. Cover other burners or hard to clean parts 
    of your stove with foil. Have plenty of paper towels to absorb oil. 
    Have plenty of oil on hand.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind this is not a low calorie item, even though much of 
    the oil escapes, some ends up in the pancakes. No matter how 
    delicious they are you probably don't want to pig out on them unless 
    you're a farm or steel mill worker.</li>
  <li>Some recipes try to make these pancakes neater and firmer. That's 
    not the point - this is Polish peasant fare, not French gourmet. The 
    pancakes should be a bit ragged, lose textured and with just enough 
    integrity so you can handle them with a turner. They should be thin 
    enough to be thoroughly cooked through by time they're lightly 
    browned.</li>
  <li>Use a very thin wide flexible turner for handling. A wooden 
    spatula is better for flattening and shaping them.</li>
  <li>Most of the splattering will happen immediately upon spooning 
    scoops of potato into the pan.</li>
  <li>Know your pan and stove. Watch temperature carefully as you cook.
  </li>
  <li>You will end up with a fair amount of liquid in the bottom of the
    mixing bowl when all the pancakes are done. This is normal.</li>
  <li>Be sure to clean up all oil spatter right away. In a couple of 
    days it will have dried to varnish making the job much more difficult 
    (lard is much easier to clean up).</li>
  </ul></li>
