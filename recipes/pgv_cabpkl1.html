A quick, but fine and attractive salad you need make no apologies for. 
It works well on the buffet (but make more). As given it will make 4 
salad size servings. See also <a href="pgv_cabpkl1.html#01"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <li>Remove damaged or discolored leaves from <b>CABBAGE</b>. Cut it 
    into wedges about 2-1/2 inches wide, then cut crosswise into 
    shreds about 1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very small.</li>
  <li>Cap and seed <b>BELL PEPPER</b> and cut into short narrow 
    slivers.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PICKLE</b> into thin slices. Cut the Slices into thin 
    matchsticks. Cut matchsticks crosswise quite fine.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All items</b> tossing well so everything is evenly coated 
    with the mayonnaise.</li>
  <li>If you have time, give it some rest in the fridge to blend flavors. 
    Serve lightly chilled.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe just said "Cabbage". I 
  made it with a mix of White and Red, because that's what I had left 
  over from other projects. The recipe said "Green Pepper", but I had 
  1/2 a Red Bell Pepper, so I used that and it worked just fine. The 
  only Sweet Pickles I had were some moderately sweet ones from Armenia. 
  They worked fine too.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's Real (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods 
  Real (west of the Mississippi), as most food writers agree.</li>
