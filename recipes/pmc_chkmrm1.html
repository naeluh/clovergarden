Delicious! and it has plenty of sauce for serving with Rice or Mashed 
Potatoes. I have re-stepped the pattern recipe for my way of serving -

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (17 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into serving size chunks.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> stems flush with caps. Slice caps about 
    1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>BUTTER</b> in a saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> over moderate heat until they have given up most 
    of their water, but there is still some in the pan. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Tumble <b>Chicken</b> in it to 
    coat lightly.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qts), heat 3 T <b>Butter</b> 
    and fry <b>Chicken</b>, tumbling often, until lightly browned. Remove 
    from the pan and set aside. Do this in two batches, adding 1 T of 
    <b>Butter</b> between if needed. Be careful the fond adhering to the 
    pan doesn't get too dark, it's part of the recipe.</li>
  <li>Add a little more <b>Butter</b> if needed and fry <b>Onions</b> 
    just until translucent, again watching that the fond doesn't get 
    too dark.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Chicken</b> back in and sprinkle with <b>Paprika</b>. 
    Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a simmer and 
    simmer tightly covered until Chicken is tender, about 40 minutes. 
    </li>
  <li>Turn down heat to stop bubbling. Stir in <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Sour Cream</b> until all lumps are gone. Turn heat back on 
    and bring up until you see the first bubbles, then turn off and 
    give it a final stir.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley</b> and accompanied by 
    Steamed Rice or Potatoes.</li>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; I always use Thigh Meat, as it has far better 
  flavor and texture than the cardboard breast meat we get around here. 
  The pattern recipe used a whole chicken cut up into serving pieces, 
  but I find skinless, boneless meat much better for serving. I retain 
  the flavor of whole chicken by making the stock with the skins, bones, 
  fat and offcuts from the meat, then defat it using a gravy separator.
  This I usually do a day or more ahead.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms work well here, but 
  others can be used. Mushrooms are bulky and don't keep at all well, 
  so I usually fry the mushroom right away. Sealed in plastic they'll 
  keep several days in the fridge.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice or Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I usually eat this with plain 
  Steamed Jasmine Rice, but <a href="1sv_potatsmsh1.html">
  <b>Smashed Potatoes</b></a> would work well, and, since there's so much 
  sauce, plain <b>Mashed Potatoes</b> would be fine too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments</h3>&nbsp;  A great many Polish recipes are done in the 
  oven. That way, they can be attractively presented at a "family style" 
  table (European service). I very rarely serve that way, and try to 
  avoid hot ovens here in sunny Southern California. I usually serve on 
  a buffet, or at the table "Russian service" (restaurant style). For 
  these reasons I have re-stepped the recipe. For oven, follow these 
  steps:
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Mushrooms</b> as above.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Chicken</b> as above, and place in a coverable oven dish. 
    Sprinkle <b>Paprika</b> over.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Onions</b> as above. and pour over the Chicken.</li>
  <li>In the saut&eacute; pan, bring some of the <b>Stock</b> to a 
    boil and scrape up all the fond adhering to the pan.</li>
  <li>Pour all <b>Stock</b> and 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> over the Chicken. Cover 
    the pan tightly and place in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until 
    the Chicken is tender.</li>
  <li>Scatter <b>Mushrooms</b> over the Chicken. Spoon <b>Sour Cream</b> 
    over Mushrooms. Scatter <b>Parsley</b> over everything. Cover and 
    place back in the Oven for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
  </ol> 
  </li>
