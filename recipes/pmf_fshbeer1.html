<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Carp, a delicious 
  fish very popular in Poland, but I do not serve it to guests here 
  in North America. I have seen many recipes for Carp, not one of which 
  mentioneds that Carp flesh is shot full of pin bones. The rest of the 
  world has learned to deal with these at the table, but North Americans 
  haven't. Catfish (American or Vietnamese) is a good substitute, or 
  Tilapia - a fine fish detested by Chefs, because everyone knows it's 
  low cost. The photo example was made with Tilapia. For more on Carp, 
  see our  <a href="../ingred/sf_carpcoz.html"><b>Common Carp</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beer:</h3> &nbsp; That'll be a decent U.S. microbrewery or 
  imported beer with good flavor and noticeable hops.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The sauce is quite sweet, but ballanced a 
  bit by the bitterness of the beer in the liquid, so serve with some 
  of the liquid. Add another 1/4 pound of fish and this can stretch to 
  3 servings with potatoes or noodles.</li>
