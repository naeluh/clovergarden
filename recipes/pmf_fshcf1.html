Delicious and attractive, this is a substantial dish so needs only a 
salad, and perhaps some cubes of fruit and cheese for dessert. Do read

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>Cauliflower</b> into smalish Florets. Weight is for florets 
    only. Steam <b>Florets</b> until just tender and tasting cooked. 
    Refresh under cold running water and set aside. This can be done a 
    day ahead an kept in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Fillet <b>FISH</b> if needed. Weight is for fillets only.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut <b>Fish Fillets</b> to fit you dish, or as desired.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in half crosswise, then at 90&deg; slice 
    about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for Garnish.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, prepare <b>Court Bouillon</b> for 
    poaching Fish Fillets (See <a href="pmf_fshcf1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Bring 
    it up to a simmer, ready to use.</li>
  <li>In a small saucepan, place a couple of tablespoons of <b>Water</b> 
    and the <b>Cauliflower</b>. Bring it to a boil just long enough 
    to warm the Cauliflower. Keep fairly hot but below cooking 
    temperature.</li>
  <li>In a small saut&eacute; pan, Heat 2 T <b>Butter</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry stirring until they start yielding their 
    liquid. Pour in 2/3 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a 
    simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; in a small pan, heat 3 T <b>Butter</b> and stir 
    in <b>Flour</b>. Fry stirring over moderate heat until you have a 
    Blonde Roux.</li>
  <li>Start stirring a little of the <b>Half-and-Half</b> into the 
    <b>Roux</b> increasing the amount little by little until you have 
    a loose smooth mixture and have incorporated the whold cup. Stir it 
    all into the Mushroom water to make a sauce. Stir in <b>Salt</b> to 
    taste.</li>
  <li>Makes sure your <b>Cauliflower</b> is fairly hot.</li> 
  <li>Bring <b>Court Bouillon</b> just to a boil, then place in it the 
    number of <b>Fish Fillets</b> you intend to serve right now. Turn 
    heat to low and poach just until done, 4 to 8 minutes depending on 
    Fish and thickness of fillets.</li>
  <li>Lift <b>Fish Fillets</b> out onto warm plates. Arrange 
    <b>Cauliflower Florets</b> around the fish, then pour sauce over 
    the fish. Garnish with a sprinkle of <b>Paprika</b> and the 
    <b>Parsley</b>. Serve immediately.</li>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Fillets should weigh about 5-1/2 ounces 
  on the plate. As the Polish name indicates, the recipe was written for 
  Flounder, but flounder is a light flavored fish easily replaced by 
  others. The example photo was made with Tilapia and worked fine. For 
  guests, I'd probably us Golden Pompano. If you'd like to use flounder, 
  we have a good selection of flounders here in North America (and one 
  that's a total disaster). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_floundz.html"><b>Flounders</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Court Bouillon:</h3> &nbsp; Several recipes will be found on 
  our <a href="gmf_fishpoach1.html#court"><b>Poaching Fish</b></a> 
  page. Truth be told, I usually use the #5 CB "No Fuss" recipe, perhaps 
  with Herbs. French Chefs may feel free to gasp in horror at this point.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking doesn't take a long time, but it 
  takes very close attention, and 4 burners. One is used only a few 
  minutes while making the roux and stirring in the Half-and-Half. You 
  could keep another free by using an electric skillet for poaching. 
  I wouldn't try to do more than 6 fillets (1-1/2 recipes) in a home 
  kitchen without assistants. 
  <p>At the point where the sauce is made and thickened, you can take a 
  little time off before starting the poaching - IF you keep your 
  temperatures carefully regulated. Before starting the poaching, make 
  sure your Cauliflower is hot.</p>
  <p>This dish goes well with wine. Philistine that I am, I drink red 
  wine with everything, but this dish is substantial enough a red wine 
  would be fine for most people.</p>
