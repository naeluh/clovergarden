  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>Mushrooms</b> stems flush with caps. Slice caps about 
    1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> on the large holes of your box grater.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Preheat Oven to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>BUTTER</b> in a saut&eacute; pan and fry <b>Mushrooms</b> 
    over moderate heat until they have given up most of their water, 
    but there is still some in the pan. Set aside</li>
  <li>Select a suitable oven-proof dish, a fairly wide dish is best, so 
    the layer of Fish is not too thick. Arrange <b>FISH</b> evenly in the 
    dish and sprinkle with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Lemon Juice</b>. Place in 
    the Oven for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pull out of the Oven. Scatter <b>Mushrooms</b> over the fish. 
    Spread <b>Sour Cream</b> over the Mushrooms and scatter 
    <b>Cheese</b> on top.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with <b>Paprika</b> to taste, then sprinkle with the 
    <b>Bread Crumbs</b>.</li>
  <li> Return to the Oven for another 15 to 25 minutes, or until Fish 
    flakes easily. This depends on your type of fish and thickness of the 
    stack in the center. You can usually detect this by sticking a salad 
    fork down through the center.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Potatoes, Noodles or even Rice. This dish can be 
    reheated in the oven.</li>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; The recipe did not specify the fish to 
  use. The photo example was made with Tilapia, which worked fine in 
  this recipe. I wouldn't use an expensive fish with these strongly 
  flavored toppings.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms work well here, but 
  others can be used.Mushrooms are bulky and don't keep at all well, 
  so I usually do the mushroom steps right away. Sealed in plastic 
  they'll keep several days in the fridge.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for a Sharp Cheddar. 
  A nearly white English aged sharp cheddar was used for th photo example.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe had shorter times and did 
  the cooking in the broiler. That was a total disaster in my broiler, 
  so I moved it to the oven where it worked fine. The photo example was 
  still a little underdone, so expect your bread crumbs to have completely 
  absorbed color.</li>
