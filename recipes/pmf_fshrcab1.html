Unusual color, but fine eating. The Fish and the Cabbage are of equal 
importance here. Makes enough for 5 to 6 main servings. Serve with 
something like <a href="1sv_potatsmsh1.html"><b>Smashed Potatoes</b></a>.

  <li>Fillet your <b>FISH</b> if not already done.</li>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILLETS</b> into serving size pieces as desired. If 
    using Carp, cut crosswise and no shorter than 2 inches, or the pin 
    bones will be difficult to manage.</li>
  <li>Peel away damaged or discolored leaves from <b>CABBAGE</b>. Cut 
    into 6 wedges. Cut cores from wedges and cut crosswise to shreds, 
    about 1/4 inch wide.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in half, then two lengthwise wedge cuts to near 
    the root. Slice fairly thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a 5 quart, non-reactive pot, bring 2-1/2 quarts of water to a 
    boil. Stir in <b>Cabbage</b>, slosh it around and immediately pour 
    out through a strainer. Return to the pot and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or similar, melt <b>Butter</b> 
    and fry <b>Onion</b> over moderate heat until light golden.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Flour</b> onto the onions stirring well to keep it 
    from forming lumps, then stir in <b>Red Wine</b>. Stir until evenly 
    distributed and thickening some.</li>
  <li>Stir into the <b>Cabbage</b>: <b>Lemon Juice</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and 
    <b>Pepper</b>, then mix <b>Cabbage</b> into <b>Onions</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>SUGAR</b>, cover and simmer over low heat until cabbage 
    is pretty much done, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Fish</b> and tumble to bury under the <b>Cabbage</b>. Do 
    this quickly before the fish starts to flake. Bring to a boil, then 
    simmer covered until Fish will flake, 5 to 12 minutes depending on 
    fish and thickness of fillets. Be careful not to over cook.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of Cabbage along with the Fish.</li>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe strongly suggests 
  Tench or Carp. Making this for myself, I'd use delicious Carp, but 
  not for guests. I have seen a hundred Carp recipes, and not a single 
  one has mentioned that Carp flesh is shot full of tiny pin bones that 
  <u>cannot</u> be removed before cooking (Tench, same problem). The 
  rest of the world has learned to deal with these at the table, but 
  not in North America. Catfish would be a good substitute (unless you 
  are an observant Jew), but Golden Pompano  or Japanese Amberjack would 
  do fine. Tilapia will work fine too, if treated gently. The main 
  thing is that the fish is fairly mild and holds together well with wet 
  cooking. The photo example was made with Tilapia. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_carpcoz.html"><b>Common Carp</b></a> page and 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> 
  page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is quite flexible as to scale, 
  and could be reduced to as far as half size.</li>
