Many years before Clovegarden, even years before the Internet, I 
reconstructed this recipe from childhood memory - it was one of my 
favorites.
</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
None of my Polish cookbooks include this recipe - too "peasanty"?  
Today, with the Internet, I can find recipes called "Haluski" from Polish 
communities in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, some of which match my 
childhood memories from Connecticut.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
<ol>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGE</b> and shred. Cut shreds into lengths of about 
  1-1/2 inches, or as desired.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol start="3">
<li>Start lots of salted <b>Water</b> heating to a boil, as for any 
  Pasta.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, melt <b>Butter</b>. Stir in 
  <b>Caraway Seeds</b> and <b>Onions</b>. Fry over moderate heat (it's 
  butter), stirring until translucent. Some people prefer a little 
  browning.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>CABBAGE</b> and fry stirring until tender, with just a 
  touch of crunch left. Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Hold warm.
  </li> 
<li>Cook <b>Noodles</b> until just done - don't overcook! If you stir 
  the Noodles into boiling water soon after stirring the Cabbage into 
  the pan, they'll both be ready about the same time.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Noodles</b> into <b>Cabbage</b>. Bring up hot and stir 
  in <b>Sour Cream</b>. Cook, another 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
  </li>
<li>Serve hot. This dish reheats well in the oven as a casserole.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kluski:</h3> &nbsp; This word most often means "dumplings", but 
  can also mean "noodles". In North America, wide Egg Noodles are most 
  used (I have always used American Beauty Extra Wide, which have a nice 
  twist to them). I know noodles are often used in Poland, as I've 
  purchased packages of Polish made <i>Lazanki</i> (wide square noodles 
  with a twist), that mention cooking them with Cabbage. Various 
  dumplings are also used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sour Cream:</h3> &nbsp; While my childhood memory definitely 
  includes sour cream, and 1/2 cup is a common amount called for in 
  recipes this size. Some recipes don't call for it, so if you omit it, 
  increase the amount of butter. </li>
