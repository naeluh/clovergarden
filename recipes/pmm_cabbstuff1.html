<p>My method of handling the cabbage makes the rolls much easier and 
a lot safer to make than most recipes.</p>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr - 1 hr work)
<br>See <a href="pmm_cabbstuff1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> 
for method.
<ol>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGES</b>. It is very important to remove the core 
  completely so boiling water can get at the stem ends of the leaves, 
  and for ease of stripping off the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot tall enough to completely 
  submerge a Cabbage. Lower one of the <b>Cabbages</b> in (Carefully - 
  see <a href="pmm_cabbstuff1.html#03"><b>Danger!</b></a>) and hold it down with a wooden 
  spoon in the core hole for about 5 minutes. Swish it around a bit, 
  and when the outer two leaves start to drift away, it's ready. With 
  the burner still on high, hold the Cabbage steady with the 
  wooden spoon. Take tongs and start peeling away the outermost leaves. 
  Hold each by the stem, gently shaking it loose and lifting it out. 
  Peel until the leaves are getting too small to stuff. Lift out the 
  remaining cabbage and set it aside. Now do the other Cabbage. Keep 
  the small and torn leaves and some of the water for cooking.</li>
<li>Place each softened cabbage leaf outside up on your cutting board and 
  shave the thick central rib thinner to make the leaf more flexible (see 
  <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>).</li>
<li>Grind <b>PORK</b>, <b>BEEF</b> and <b>CHICKEN</b> quite fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small and fry in a little oil until showing some 
  color, mix into meat.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>THYME</b> fine. Grate <b>Nutmeg</b>. 
   Massage into <b>Meat mix</b> along with all remaining <b>Sauce 
   items</b> until very evenly distributed.</li>
<li>Place each leaf inside up, and place a gob of stuffing (be generous, 
  this isn't hors d'oeuvres) near the stem end. Give it one turn, Fold 
  the sides in and roll up. Keep chilled until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Dice <b>CARROT</b>, <b>CELERY</b> and <b>ONION</b> very small. Spread 
  them on the bottom of your chosen cooking vessel (See 
  <a href="pmm_cabbstuff1.html#02"><b>Method</b></a>) along with <b>Bay Leaf</b>. Arrange 
  <b>Cabbage Rolls</b> on top,flap side down.</li>
<li>Mix <b>Tomato Sauce</b>, <b>Stock</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Pour over the 
  rolls. Arrange <b>Bacon Slices</b> over the top and proceed with 
  cooking by your chosen method (see <a href="pmm_cabbstuff1.html#02"><b>Method</b></a>).
  </li>
<li>Dice <b>Bacon</b> small for garnish or mix with sauce. Serve hot, with 
  some sauce over and sour cream on the side. This recipe reheats 
  very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for one very large cabbage 
  but I prefer two medium (about 2-1/2 pounds each) which will be safer 
  to handle, and the leaves are more even in size. Two 2-1/2 pound 
  cabbages will yield about 20 to 24 leaves of suitable size.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; There are several ways you can cook the rolls. 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Dutch Oven:</b> &nbsp; This is the traditional method. 
    Preheat oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C. Arrange the Cabbage Rolls as 
    noted in the instructions, placing them in several layers. Add 1/4 
    cup of the cabbage cooking liquid (in addition to the sauce). When 
    the oven is ready, cover the Dutch oven tightly and bring to a simmer 
    on the stove top. Place in the hot oven and bake for about 3/4 hour.
    </li>
  <li><b>Saut&eacute; Pan</b> &nbsp; Arrange the rolls in a spacious 
    saut&eacute; pan, preferably in a single layer. Pour in 1 cup  
    cabbage cooking liquid (in addition to the sauce) and bring to a 
    simmer, cover tightly and simmer about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Electric Skillet</b> &nbsp; This is the method I use for 
    parties, because it keeps the stove free. Arrange rolls in an 
    electric skillet, preferably in a single layer. Add in about 1-1/2 
    cups of the cabbage cooking liquid (in addition to the sauce). Cover 
    tightly and set to just keep the water boiling. Cook for 20 to 25 
    minutes, a little less if you'll be reheating the rolls before 
    serving. When done, I cut them in half crosswise (easier to handle 
    on a party plate) and carefully stack them in a smaller electric 
    skillet set to "keep warm", then pour some sauce over them.</li>
    </ul>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Danger!</h3> &nbsp; You've got a big pot of boiling water and 
  you're dealing with a big, heavy, misbehaving lump of cabbage. Most 
  methods ask you to remove the cabbage to peel the leaves. This is 
  dangerous as the cabbage is very heavy coming out, and any slip 
  results in a tsunami of scalding hot water. My method, described 
  in the instructions, is far safer, as the cabbage is tiny by time it 
  is taken out. It is also quicker and produces the best quality, 
  evenly cooked leaves. I used a strong skimmer purchased from a 
  restaurant supply (see <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4x.html#gal"><b>Photo 
  Gallery</b></a>) to lower the Cabbage in and lift it out, steadied with 
  a wooden spoon in the core hole.</li>
