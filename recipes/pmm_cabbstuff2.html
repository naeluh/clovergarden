Good hearty peasant fare, filling and economical, these or similar rolls 
are sure to appear at any Ukrainian feast or party. This recipe is for  
meat and rice filled, probably the most common.

<p>My method of handling the cabbage makes the rolls much easier and 
a lot safer to make than most recipes.
<br>All meat, buckwheat, and other fillings are also used. For the 
rolls, Spinach and Sauerkraut leaves, and in the far south even Grape 
Leaves may be used instead of Cabbage.</p>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hr - 1 hr work)
<br>See <a href="pmm_cabbstuff2x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> 
for method.
<ol>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGES</b>. It is very important to remove the core 
  completely so boiling water can get at the stem ends of the leaves, 
  and for ease of stripping off the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot tall enough to completely 
  submerge a Cabbage. Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Lower 
  one of the <b>Cabbages</b> in (Carefully - see <a href="pmm_cabbstuff2.html#02">
  <b>Danger!</b></a>) 
  and hold it down with a wooden spoon in the core hole for about 5 
  minutes. Swish it around a bit,   and when the outer two leaves start 
  to drift away, it's ready. With the burner still on high, hold the 
  Cabbage steady with the wooden spoon. Take tongs and start peeling 
  away the outermost leaves. Hold each by the stem, gently shaking it 
  loose and lifting it out. Peel until the leaves are getting too small 
  to stuff. Lift out the remaining cabbage and set it aside. Now do the 
  other Cabbages. Keep the small and torn leaves and some of the water 
  for cooking.</li>
<li>Place each softened cabbage leaf outside up on your cutting board and 
  shave the thick central rib thinner to make the leaf more flexible (see 
  <a href="pmm_cabbstuff2x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>).</li>
<li>Partially cook <b>RICE</b> (see <a href="pmm_cabbstuff2.html#03"><b>Rice</b></a>) and 
  let cool.</li>
<li>Grind <b>PORK</b> and <b>BEEF</b> well. Mix.</li>
<li>Massage <b>Rice</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> into the 
  <b>Meat mix</b> until uniformly distributed.</li>
<li>Place each leaf inside up, and place a gob of stuffing (be generous, 
  this isn't hors d'oeuvres) near the stem end. Give it one turn, Fold 
  the sides in and roll up. Keep chilled until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Fry in 4 T <b>Bacon Drippings</b> until 
  translucent.</li>
<li>Mix <b>Tomato Sauce</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b> with the 
  <b>Onions</b>. Bring to a simmer and check for seasoning and salt.
  </li>
<li>Choose a cooking method (see <a href="pmm_cabbstuff2.html#07"><b>Method</b></a>). 
  Line the bottom of the chosen vessel with the small and torn 
  <b>Cabbage Leaves</b>. Place a layer of <b>Rolls</b> fairly tightly 
  (but not jammed) over the leaves. Sprinkle around some 
  <b>Sauerkraut</b> (if using) and pour some of the <b>Tomato Sauce</b> 
  over. Repeat until you run out of rolls. Top with more <b>Cabbage 
  Leaves</b> (if you have any left). Cook per the method you have chosen.
  </li>
<li>Serve hot as desired, garnished with <b>Sour Cream</b> or with Sour 
  Cream on the side. For buffet service, I have usually made them a bit 
  ahead, and cut each roll in half before arranging in a smaller electric 
  skillet. Half rolls are much easier to handle on party plates. This 
  recipe reheats very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for a 6 to 7 pound 
  cabbage, but three 2-1/2 pound cabbages would work better, safer to 
  handle, and with leaves of more even size. Three 2-1/2 pound cabbages 
  will yield 30 to 36 stuffable leaves.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Danger!</h3> &nbsp; You've got a big pot of boiling water and 
  you're dealing with a big, heavy, misbehaving lump of cabbage. Most 
  methods ask you to remove the cabbage to peel the leaves. This is 
  dangerous as the cabbage is very heavy coming out, and any slip results 
  in a tsunami of scalding hot water. My method, described in the 
  instructions, is far safer, as the cabbage is tiny by time it is taken 
  out. It is also quicker and produces the best quality, evenly cooked 
  leaves. I use a strong skimmer purchased from a restaurant supply (see 
  <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>) to lower 
  the Cabbage in and lift it out, steadied with a wooden spoon in the 
  core hole.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Medium grain (California) rice is best for this. 
  Start steaming as usual with about 2-2/3 cups of water per cup of rice. 
  Cook until most water is absorbed but the rice is still a bit stiff in 
  the center, but not crunchy. Drain and let cool.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bacon Drippings:</h3> For you young'uns unfamiliar with the 
  terminology of your grandparents, this is fat rendered from bacon, 
  in other words, smoked lard. Don't worry, it's nowhere near as 
  unhealthy as the trans fats and polyunsaturated oils the Heart 
  Association told you to use instead. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using tomato paste called for 
  in recipes, I like to add a convenient 8oz can of a very simple tomato 
  sauce, which helps make up for deficient tomatoes. My favorite is 
  Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> This is optional according to taste. Drained 
  (but not rinsed) sauerkraut is to be scattered over each layer. In 
  Ukraine some folks use whole leaf sauerkraut as the wrapper rather 
  than fresh cabbage. This is most common in older recipes from when 
  cabbage was commonly fermented in the home.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; There are several ways you can cook the 
  rolls. 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Dutch Oven:</b> &nbsp; This is the traditional method. 
    Preheat oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C. Arrange the Cabbage Rolls as 
    noted in the instructions, placing them in several layers. add about 
    1/4 cup cabbage cooking water (in addition to the sauce). When the 
    oven is ready, cover the Dutch oven tightly and bring to a simmer 
    on the stove top. Place in the hot oven and bake for about 3/4 hour.
    </li>
  <li><b>Saut&eacute; Pan</b> &nbsp; Arrange the rolls in a spacious 
    saut&eacute; pan. Add about 1 cup of the cabbage cooking liquid 
    (in addition to the sauce). Bring to a simmer, cover tightly 
    and simmer about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Electric Skillet</b> &nbsp; This is the method I use for 
    parties, because it keeps the stove free. Arrange rolls in an 
    electric skillet, and put in 1-1/2 cups of cabbage cooking liquid 
    (in addition to the sauce) Cover tightly and set to just keep the 
    water boiling. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, a little less if you'll 
    be reheating the rolls before serving. When done I cut them 
    in half crosswise (easier to handle on a party plate) and carefully 
    stack them in a smaller electric skillet set to "keep warm".</li>
    </ul></li>
