This delicious pot roast is a Lithuanian version of the 
Polish-Lithuanian "Hussar's Roast". The lists of ingredients and 
instructions are long, but it's pretty easy to make.

<p>
The Poles don't generally use horseradish in their stuffing and are more 
likely to make crosswise cuts for stuffing. I use fresh grated 
horseradish which is extremely pungent, but once cooked it's quite mild.
You will need a heavy Dutch Oven with a tight fitting lid.</p>

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs - 1-1/2 hrs work)
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
<li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into short strips. In an iron skillet or the heavy 
  roasting pan you will use for the beef, fry it over gentle heat until 
  the fat is pretty much all rendered. Eat the bacon bits and keep the 
  fat.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> coarse. Grate <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>PARSNIPS</b> 
  coarse. Dice <b>CELERY</b>. Mix all.</li>
<li>Trim the <b>ROAST</b> of any excess fat. Bind it with kitchen twine 
  if needed to hold it together. Fry in <b>Bacon Fat</b> until nicely 
  browned on all sides. See <a href="pmm_cowhrad1.html#03"><b>Browning</b></a> for 
  details. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Vegetable mix</b> into the bacon fat and fry stirring until 
  very lightly browned.</li>
<li>Arrange in your heavy Dutch Oven: <b>Vegetables</b>, <b>Beef</b> and 
  all <b>Bouquet Garni</b> items.</li>
<li>Mix <b>Vodka</b> with <b>Vinegar</b> and pour over the Beef. Let 
  stand for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Pour <b>Wine</b> and <b>Beef Stock</b> around the Beef.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil on the stove top, then cover the pot tightly and slip 
  it into the preheated oven. Leave it there until the beef is mostly but 
  not entirely cooked. For chuck this will be about 1-1/2 hours, for round
  almost 2 hours.</li>
<li>Meanwhile: Make the Stuffing. Melt <b>Butter</b> in a small saucepan 
  and stir in <b>Horseradish Sauce</b>, stirring for a couple of minutes, 
  then stir in <b>Bread crumbs</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. Adjust to a medium 
  stuffing consistency with water and simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Slide the pot out of the oven, leaving the oven still heating.</li>
<li>Lift the <b>Beef</b> from the pot to your cutting board. With a razor 
  sharp slicing knife, make two deep slits lengthwise from end to end but 
  not quite through. Stuff these slits with the <b>Stuffing</b>.</li>
<li>Return the <b>Beef</b> to the pot, add <b>Horseradish</b> to the pot 
  (if you have left-over stuffing use that plus enough more to make up the 
  amount). Bring the pot back to a boil on the stove top and slip back 
  into the oven for another 45 minutes.</li>   
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is done, remove it from the pot and clean off pieces 
  of vegetable. At this point the meat can be covered with foil if it 
  will be served immediately or it can be let cool for reheating later.
  </li>
<li>Strain the liquid, pressing the vegetables to squeeze it all out. 
  Discard all solids. If you have a lot of fat, de-fat the liquid using 
  your gravy separator. If you trimmed the roast well there should be 
  little fat.</li>
<li>If you desire, thicken the sauce (See <a href="pmm_cowhrad1.html#04">
  <b>Serving</b></a>). In a small pan sufficient to hold the sauce, heat 
  the <b>Butter</b> and stir in the <b>Flour</b>. Fry stirring over 
  moderate heat until the flour is well incorporated and threatens to 
  color. Stir in, little by little some <u>cold</u> water until you have 
  a smooth paste. Then stir in, starting with small amounts, the sauce, 
  adding more when what you have is smooth. Finally bring to a simmer and 
  simmer stirring a few minutes until sauce is thickened. It should not 
  be too thick, it should pour smoothly - adjust liquid if needed.</li>
<li>Slice <b>Beef</b> crosswise into moderately thick slices and arrange on 
  your platter for serving. If you have let the meat cool, it can now be 
  reheated in the oven.</li>
<li>Pour hot sauce over and serve - see <a href="pmm_cowhrad1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a> 
  for serving alternatives.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; This can be Round or Chuck, but round will need 
  to cook at least 20 minutes longer.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Horseradish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp;  You can use a commercial sauce 
  containing only horseradish, water, salt and an acid (no cream). 
  Better is to make your own from fresh root - see our 
  <a href="gjv_hradish1.html"><b>Horseradish & Sauces</b></a> recipe 
  page for details and methods.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Browning:</h3> &nbsp; This is traditionally done in the Dutch oven 
  the meat will be roasted in, but this can be difficult, depending 
  on the shape and size of the meat compared to the pot. It may be more 
  practical to brown in a large iron skillet (I use an Indian 
  <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a> which gives me the 
  best possible control. After the vegetables are fried, deglaze the pan 
  with the wine / stock mixture and pour into the Dutch Oven. In any 
  case, browning such a large lump is dangerous (hot oil can splash if 
  it slips when turning), so it needs to be done by a careful, sober 
  adult with no children hanging around. If your SO can meet that 
  description it will free you to do other tasks. A 3-1/2 pound lump 
  of beef browns in about 20 minutes, a bit longer for larger lumps.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Since I serve this at buffet parties, I 
  arrange it in a shallow coverable electric pan. Boiled root vegetables 
  (potatoes, carrots, turnips) can be arranged around it. For this method 
  of serving I do not thicken the sauce. Pour in the hot sauce and heat 
  with the pan set at "low". When it starts to bubble, turn it down 
  to "warm" (about 165&deg;F/74&deg;C is safe). Keep covered so it 
  doesn't dry out.</li>
