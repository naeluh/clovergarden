While many Americans just don't eat kidneys, others of us very much like 
them. This recipe goes well with Potatoes, or Egg Noodles, or Steamed 
rice. See also <a href="pmm_kidmrm1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol>
<li>Prepare the <b>KIDNEYS</b> as needed, removing internal fat (see 
  our <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a> page 
  for complete method). Slice to look similar to the mushroom slices.</li>
<li>Place <b>Kidneys</b> in a pot with cold water to cover. Bring to a 
  boil for 2 minutes. Dump out into a clean sink and wash with warm water.
  </li> 
<li>Cut <b>MUSHROOM</b> stems flush and cut across the caps about 1/4 
  inch wide.</li>
<li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice about 1/4 inch wide 
  crosswise.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (55 min )
<ol start="5">
<li>In a saut&eacute; pan, melt <b>Butter</b>. Fry <b>Onions</b> stirring 
  until golden brown, regulating heat so butter doesn't burn.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Kidneys</b>. Fry stirring for about 5 minutes, then stir 
  in <b>Mushrooms</b>. Continue to fry stirring until mushrooms start 
  to give up their water.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Marjoram</b>, then <b>Stock</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
  <b>Pepper</b>. Cover and simmer slowly for about 15 minutes. You can 
  cook longer if you want the kidneys more tender, but I like them 
  fairly firm.</li> 
<li>Serve hot, garnished as desired</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef / Veal Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; Beef kidneys sold n North America 
  are generally from very young beefs, and can be considered "Veal 
  Kidneys". These are generally available in markets serving Russian, 
  Eastern European, Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and Latin American 
  communities. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms work well, though 
  in Poland they use a wide selection of mushrooms.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork Stock will work fine. Either 
  one should be fairly strong. Adjust quantity to how much sauce you 
  want - which depends on what you will serve it with. I usually like 
  more sauce than in the photo example.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; When I was a small child, my favorite dishes 
  were the few Polish ones my mother knew how to cook, and a kidney dish 
  like this one I very much liked. Unfortunately, my mother was not an 
  enthusiastic cook. She thought the Polish dishes were too much trouble, 
  so she would not make them often, despite requests.</li>
