  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into sticks about 1/2 inch on a side and 2 to 3 
    inches long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> stems flush with caps. Slice caps about 
    1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise, then slice thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your
   <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
    off the skins under running water. Cut into thin strips about 1 inch 
    long and add to Onions. See <a href="pmm_pigmrm1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into threads, then cut 
    threads crosswise very fine. Add to Onions.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Butter</b> in a saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> over moderate heat until they have given up most 
    of their water, but there is still some in the pan. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In a spacious skillet or saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qts), heat 2 T 
    <b>Lard</b>. Fry <b>Pork</b> over highest heat, tumbling often, 
    until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving 
    fat in the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring often and scraping up 
    any fond in the pan, just until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Pork</b> back in, along with the <b>Mushrooms</b>. 
    Sprinkle with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Maggi</b>. Place over <u>low 
    heat</u> and fry uncovered, tumbling fairly often, until Pork is 
    still firm, but edible, about 20 minutes. It should be very moist, 
    but with no free liquid in the pan.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Steamed Rice. This recipe reheats well.</li>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; This should be fairly lean with excess fat 
  removed. Shoulder and leg have better flavor than loin (where Pork 
  Chops come from) or tenderloin.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms work well here, but 
  others can be used. Mushrooms are bulky and don't keep at all well, 
  so I usually do the mushroom steps right away. Fried and sealed in 
  plastic they'll keep several days in the fridge.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Ginger:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe used 1 teaspoon Ground 
  Ginger, fresh ginger being very scarce in Poland. Here in Southern 
  California Fresh Ginger is a staple I always have on hand, so I used 
  that for its superior flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; This has always been the dominant frying medium 
  of Poland. I call for it without apology - it's health profile is 
  better than Butter, it doesn't clog arteries, and it goes to higher 
  temperatures than butter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Maggi Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; This bottled seasoning is very 
  popular in much of the world, especially Europe and Southeast 
  Asia, but varies from region to region. The European would be 
  appropriate for this recipe, but is hard to find here in California. 
  The common Chinese version is good, but the Mexican seems lacking.
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_maggiz.html"><b>Maggi 
  Seasoning</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bell Pepper</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did not blast the Bell 
  Pepper, just chopped it small. I always blast, because it improves 
  texture, prevents annoying skins from floating around, and allows 
  pieces to be larger. This is especially after reheating, but cooking 
  time for this recipe is long enough to cast skins loose. Removing 
  the skins takes only a couple minutes with the 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07"> 
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is by a lady who grew up 
  in Suwalki, a bit north of Bialystok. She says it is the favorite 
  recipe of both her brothers, and I don't doubt this at all.</li>
