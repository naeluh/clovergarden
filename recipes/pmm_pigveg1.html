A simple but quite satisfying cottage stew from older times. In winter, 
pork, a few root vegetables, and cabbage would be about all most Polish 
households would have. See also see <a href="pmm_pigveg1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

    inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1-1/2 to 3/4 inch chunks

  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b>. Quarter lengthwise and cut into about 1

  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)

  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, heat 
    <b>Lard / Oil</b> and fry <b>Pork Cubes</b>, tumbling until raw

    hurt.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions</b> to the pan and fry stirring until translucent. 
    Again, a touch of browning won't hurt.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>, then <b>Broth</b>, 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer tightly covered, tumbling 
    a couple of times, until Pork is tender (30 to 45 min). 
    Adjust liquid if needed - don't let it get too dry.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, Garnished with parsley. A salad on the side should be 
    sufficient.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Just about any cut will work, since cooking time 
  won't be much different. Loin pork chops were specified by the pattern 
  recipe. Loin and Tenderloin have the least flavor but can be cut more 
  formally. I used shoulder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_pigc.html"><b>Cuts of Pig</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes which would 
  disintegrate into mush long before the recipe is done. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "strong bouillon". 
  I used all the offcuts (including fat) from the Pork to make a strong 
  broth, strained it, and defatted it with a gravy separator.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Most recent Polish cookbooks size their 
  recipes to serve 5 to 6 people, and that's about the size of this 
  recipe - but, older cookbooks may scale higher. I had to cut this 
  recipe in half to get it down to just 6 people. As with so many 
  Polish recipes, this one was originally composed to make a fine 
  entrance to a "family style" table (European service). It was 
  assembled in layers, using whole "cutlets" (pork chops) with all but 
  1 inch of bone removed. I have kept the ingredients the same, but 
  simplified how they are arranged, because I never serve "family 
  style", always buffet style or Russian service (restaurant style).
