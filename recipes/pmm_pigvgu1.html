A Goulash far removed from Hungary - it's from the far northeast of 
Poland. It's delicious, and it reheats very well. See also <a href="pmm_pigvgu1.html#05">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into 3/4 to 1 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 3/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise, then slice thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel and Shred <b>CARROT</b> (and <b>PARSLEY ROOT</b> if you have 
    it). I use a julienning vegetable peeler, then cut the strands into 
    about 1 inch lengths. Add to Onions.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>LEEK</b> as needed, and chop white and light green small. 
    Measure is after chopping. Add to Onions.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>CELERY</b> and chop fairly small. Add to Onions.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Coating items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Tumble <b>Pork</b> in <b>Coating Mix</b> until uniformly coated.
    Shake off excess.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Lard</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) and fry 
    <b>Pork</b> over moderate heat until lightly browned all over. Be 
    careful any fond adhering to the pan does not burn, it's part of 
    the recipe. Scrape it up as you stir.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered about 
    20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Bring back to a boil, then simmer 
    covered until Vegetables and Pork are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Bring back to a boil, then simmer for 
    another 10 minutes or a little more.</li>
  <li>Check liquid to your liking and check salt. I find it needs another 
    1/2 teaspoon.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Steamed Rice or Noodles.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b><u>NOTES:</u></b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; This should be fairly lean with excess fat 
  removed. Shoulder and leg have better flavor than loin (where Pork 
  Chops come from) or tenderloin.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Parsley Root:</h3> &nbsp; You probably don't have this. It is most 
  like Celery Root, which you probably don't have either. If so, use a 
  bit extra Carrot and Celery, and some finely chopped Parsley Stems.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Leek:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for white and light green part after 
  chopping.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; This has always been the dominant frying medium 
  of Poland. I call for it without apology - it's health profile is 
  better than Butter, it doesn't clog arteries, and it goes to higher 
  temperatures than butter. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments</h3>&nbsp; The pattern recipe says, "Serve hot over rice", 
  but as with Asian stews which say the same, I find it better to 
  provide a bowl of steamed rice on the table, to be added to the bowl 
  of soup or stew as desired. With egg noodles, I'd make it with a little 
  less liquid and spoon it over the noodles.</li>
