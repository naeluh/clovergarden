Mild, tender sweetbreads in flavorful sauces were once popular but now 
appear mostly in fancy restaurants.  These are elegant, delicious, 
and not difficult to make.

<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min to 8 hrs depending)
<ol>
<li>Prepare the <b>SWEETBREADS</b> as needed. If their external membrane 
  is still in place, you will have to do at least Step-1 on 
  our <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html"><b>Veal Sweetbreads</b></a>. 
  All other steps are optional, depending on your choice.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min (includes sauce prep steps))

<li>Start <a href="pjd_whtlem1.html"><b>White Lemon Sauce</b></a>. Do 
  all prep steps so you're ready for the broth, which comes from this 
  recipe.</li>
<li>Prepare <b>Garnishes</b> as desired.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min (includes sauce steps))
<ol start="4">
<li>Place <b>Sweetbreads</b> in a pan just big enough for them, and pour 
  over enough <b>Stock</b> to just cover. Bring to a boil and turn down 
  to a simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Sweetbreads</b> reserving the stock. Slice the Sweetbreads 
  as desired and hold warm.</li> 
<li>Measure out 1 cup of the <b>Stock</b> into a sauce pan. Proceed to 
  finish your <b>White Lemon Sauce</b> per that recipe.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished as desired</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweetbreads:</h3> &nbsp; These are generally available in markets 
  serving Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and Latin American 
  communities. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html">
  <b>Veal Sweetbreads</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken stock would probably be most used, but 
  Pork stock also works well. Either one should be fairly strong.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>White Lemon Sauce:</h3> This is a standard Polish sauce served with 
  light flavored meats, such as chicken and fish, but also with omelets. 
  See our recipe for <a href="pjd_whtlem1.html">
  <b>White Lemon Sauce</b></a>. For actual service I'd make the sauce a 
  little more liquid than I did for the photo.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garnishes:</h3> &nbsp; Suggested garnishes are small white 
  mushrooms, with stems cut flush. The pattern recipe calls for them to 
  be simmered, but those in the photo were gently fried in butter. A mix 
  of fresh Flatleaf Parsley and Dill is a common garnish in the region. 
  Polish croutons are a popular garnish and are simple to make. See our 
  recipe <a href="pkg_crouton1.html"><b>Polish Croutons</b></a>.</li>
