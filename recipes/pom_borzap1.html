<p>While this soup can be made with Beef Short Ribs rather than Pork, 
if I want beef, I usually use <a href="pom_ribhet1.html">
<b>Beef Rib Soup, Hetman-style</b></a>.</p> 

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs - 45 min work)
<ol>
<li>Separate individual <b>RIBS</b> and cut into shorter lengths if 
  needed for your chosen service style (see <a href="pom_borzap1.html#04"><b>Serving 
  Options</b></a>).</li>
<li>Place <b>Ribs</b> in a pot with 8 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a 
  boil, skimming any scum that rises as it starts to boil.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Salt</b>, <b>Peppercorns</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>. 
  cover tightly and simmer about 1 hour (at least 1-3/4 hours for beef 
  ribs).</li> 
<li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Slice 
  <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Mix.</li>
<li>Peel <b>BEETS</b> and dice about 3/4 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Sauerkraut</b> but not too much. Do not squeeze out or 
  rinse. Chop very coarse (about 1-1/2 inches long) so it won't tangle 
  up into a big ball in the soup.</li>
<li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> until translucent but 
  not at all browned. Stir into <b>Ribs</b>.</li>
<li>When <b>Ribs</b> have cooked their allotted time, stir in 
  <b>Beets</b>, <b>Sauerkraut</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Bring 
  back to a boil and simmer another 40 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Remove the <b>Ribs</b> from the soup and process as required for 
  your chosen serving style (see <a href="pom_borzap1.html#04"><b>Serving 
  Options</b></a>).</li>
<li>Finish with <b>Lemon Juice</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. Check seasoning 
  and serve hot, garnished with parsley. Serve <b>Sour Cream</b> on the 
  side to be added by individual diners as they see fit. Do <u>not</u> 
  stir sour cream into the pot - it turns the soup a brilliant 
  fluorescent pink many find unappetizing, but Filipinos like that 
  color.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; This is most often made with 
  Pork Spare Ribs, but Beef Short Ribs can be used with adjustment of 
  cooking time. In either case they should be "bone in", as boniness is 
  considered important to this soup.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp; Select a good quality sauerkraut. Very fine 
  ones are imported from Poland in jars. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_skrautz.html"><b>Sauerkraut</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sour Cream:</h3> &nbsp; Select a good, tart, naturally made Sour 
  Cream. Some supermarket brands are highly artificial, gum stabilized 
  and hardly at all sour.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving Options:</h3> &nbsp; The most traditional 
  way to serve this is to remove the ribs intact and serve them as a 
  next course after the soup. Another option, particularly with Beef 
  ribs, is to pull the ribs, remove the bones, cut the meat to soup 
  size pieces and return to the soup. This would be a good way for 
  buffet service with either beef or pork ribs. A third option, which 
  I used for the photo specimen, is to cut the ribs in short pieces 
  before cooking (a little over 1 inch), and just leave them in the 
  soup for service. This is easily done using a sharp Chinese cleaver 
  knife driven by a soft faced mallet.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Zaporizhia:</h3> &nbsp; This city is on the Dnieper river in the 
  eastern half of Ukraine. This was the region of the Zaporizhian Sich, 
  stronghold of the Zaporizhian Cossack Host (Kozak in Ukranian). The 
  Kozaks, feeling abused by Polish Hetman Mikolaj "Bear Paw" Potocki, 
  allied with the Russians against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
  That didn't work out in the long run. The Sich was over-run by the 
  Russian Empire and it's fortress burned to the ground.</li>
