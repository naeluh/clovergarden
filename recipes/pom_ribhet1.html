<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs - 45 min work)
<ol>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and rub <b>BEEF</b> all over with it.</li>
<li>Mix <b>Flour</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Chop <b>HAM</b> fine.</li> 
<li>Melt <b>Bacon Drippings</b>. I start this recipe in a 3-1/2 
  quart saut&eacute; pan and transfer to a 5 quart pot when the 
  vegetables are added. A 4 quart Dutch oven will work, especially if 
  you're braising in the oven.</li>
<li>Dredge <b>Beef</b> in the <b>Flour mix</b> to coat lightly and fry 
  <b>Beef</b> until medium browned on all sides.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>HAM</b> and <b>Wine</b>. Cover tightly and simmer for 
  1-1/2 hours or until beef is almost tender.</li>
<li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Slice 
  <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Crush <b>Peppercorns</b> 
  medium. Mix all.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and dice about 1/2 inch on a side. Hold in cold 
  water until needed.</li>
<li>When <b>Beef</b> is nearly tender, stir in <b>Onion mix</b>, 
  drained <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Stock</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
  Cover tightly and simmer slowly for another hour until Beef is very 
  tender.</li>
<li>Adjust Seasoning and Liquid as needed.</li>
<li>Remove <b>Bones</b> and cut <b>Beef</b> into soup size pieces as 
  you like. Return Beef to the soup.</li>
<li>Whisk together <b>Flour</b> and <b>Sour Cream</b>. Stir into the 
  soup and keep just below a simmer for about 5 minutes. Do not let 
  it come to a boil.</li>
<li>Serve hot in individual bowls garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Short Ribs:</h3> These should be "bone in", as boniness is 
  considered important to this soup. Other bony cuts such as meaty 
  shanks can be used if you can't get an acceptable price on Short Ribs.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; In Ukraine, wild mushrooms are likely to 
  be used, but they're hard to get and expensive in North America. You 
  can use white mushrooms, or some of the small King Trumpet mushrooms 
  now common in Southern California, or whatever you can get.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes work well, but other 
  waxy or boiling potatoes will too. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes 
  which tend to turn to mush if cooked much more than the minimum. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sour Cream:</h3> &nbsp; The flour will stabilize the sour cream 
  somewhat, but best to use the highest fat content sour cream you can 
  get to prevent curdling. I have used Altadena, which is 6 grams per 
  30 grams (20%) but 9 grams (30%) would be more stable.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe does all the simmering in 
  a preheated 325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven, but here in Sunny Southern 
  California we don't fire up ovens unless we really need to. I usually 
  simmer on the stovetop, which works fine. Of course, if this soup 
  actually was made by Kozaks, it would have been simmered in a cauldron 
  over a fire.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Hetman:</h3> &nbsp; This name probably comes from the Cossack 
  Hetmanate. Hetman was the title for the highest military officers in 
  the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which long ruled Ukraine. When the 
  Kozaks rebelled against Polish Hetman Mikolaj "Bear Paw" Potocki in 
  1648, they set up their own domain and used the same title for their 
  leader.</li>
