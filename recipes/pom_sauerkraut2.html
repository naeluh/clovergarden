A savory and satisfying soup, especially for cold, rainy days. 
"Authenticity" is easy to claim here since there are so many variations
(several meat options are listed).

<p>This soup can be eaten as soon as done, but it's even better when 
reheated the next day. I have also developed a 
<a href="pov_sauerkraut1.html"><b>Vegetarian Version</b></a> that I 
use more often than meat versions.</p>
<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
<ol>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into chunks 3/4 to 1 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Cut <b>MEAT</b> (See "Options" below) 1/2 to 3/4 inch on a side, but 
  not <b>Sausage</b> (if using), it goes in later. If using Ribs, cut 
  1-1/2 to 2 inches long. If using Smoked Hocks, they go in whole and 
  are deboned and cut up when done.</li>
<li>In a pot sufficient for the whole recipe (5 quart min.), place 
  <b>Meat</b> (but not Sausages or Smoked Hocks) with <b>Water</b> to 
  cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil and skim off any scum that rises 
  as it comes to a boil.</li>
<li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Potatoes</b> and all <b>Seasoning items</b> into the pot. 
  Add enough additional <b>Water</b> to cover well. Bring to a boil and 
  simmer while you work on the rest.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
<li>Dice <b>SALT PORK</b> small.</li>
<li>Put the <b>Salt Pork</b> in a skillet with about 1/16th inch of 
  <b>Water</b>. Boil the water gently to render some fat, then fry over 
  low heat, stirring until enough fat has rendered to fry the Onions.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry slowly, stirring often until you see 
  just a touch of color, then add <b>Flour</b> and stir about 2 minutes 
  more, but do not brown.</li>
<li>Stir some <b>Soup</b> from the main pot into the <b>Onion mix</b>, 
  a little at a time, and stirring until you have a smooth mixture. Stir 
  this back into the main soup pot.</li>
<li>When Potatoes are about cooked through (and not before or they'll 
  harden), strain the <b>Sauerkraut</b> from the <b>Brine</b>. Pour the 
  <b>Brine</b> into the pot. Pile the <b>Sauerkraut</b> on your 
  cutting board and cut slices through it about 1-1/2 inches apart, then 
  again at right angles (this makes it easier to eat with a spoon). 
  Stir into the pot.</li>
<li>Adjust liquid as you simmer slowly for another half hour (probably 
  longer if using Smoked Hocks).</li>
<li>If using <b>Sausage</b>, cut it into slices and quarter the slices. 
  Stir into the soup when it's mostly done.</li>
<li>IF you used Smoked Hocks, fish them out. Remove the meat from the 
  bones and discard the bones. Dice the meat (skin included) and stir 
  back into the pot.</li>
<li>You can adjust acidity to your taste using sauerkraut juice (best), 
  wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or malt vinegar. <u>Don't</u> use cider 
  vinegar - its flavor conflicts!</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose are ideal for 
  this recipe. They stay quite firm, but also thicken the soup just 
  right. Red potatoes would disintegrate too much. Avoid "Yukon Gold" 
  type potatoes like the plague - they'd be mush long before cooking 
  is done. <u>Do Not</u> add Sauerkraut until the Potatoes are nearly 
  fully cooked - acids harden the surface and they don't cook right. 
  For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; What cut of pork and just how much is pretty 
  flexible - do to your own taste. Polish sausage is, of course, a 
  natural, but other's that cook firm can be used. As I've  mentioned, 
  smoked hocks work fine too (different flavor), or one smoked hock 
  and other meats.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Dry Red:</h3> &nbsp; I use 3 hot Thai chilis, which are 
  barely detectable in this much soup, but in Southern California we 
  just don't make soup without chilis.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp; Back when I originally wrote up this recipe 
  (2004) I had abandoned Claussen, which had become absurdly expensive 
  for cooking. I was using Meter's Wisconsin Kraut, a fine product, but 
  now discontinued. Fortunately, today (2013) we can select from many 
  fine brands imported from Poland. My favorite brand is Vitarol, 
  because it is packed with plenty of brine - some brands are too dry. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_skrautz.html">
  <b>Sauerkraut</b></a>  page.</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some Sauerkraut Soup recipes have the 
  potatoes boiled separately and served as a side to the soup but I've 
  always much preferred cooking them in the soup.</li>
