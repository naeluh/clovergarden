This is a savory and satisfying soup, especially for cold, rainy 
days. I developed this version during my vegetarian days, and still 
prefer it. For details see <a href="pov_sauerkraut1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr - 55 min work)
<ol>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b>, put peels in a pan with <b>Salt</b> and 
  <b>Water</b>. Simmer for stock.</li>
<li>Cut <b>Potatoes</b> into chunks from 3/4 to 1 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Put <b>Potatoes</b> and all <b>Broth Items</b> into a pot large 
  enough to hold the final recipe (5 quart minimum). Add enough water 
  to cover well. Bring to a boil and simmer while you work on the other 
  parts.</li>
<li>Grind all <b>Spicing items</b> fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small</li>
<li>Put <b>Olive Oil</b>, <b>Sesame Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b> in a 
  skillet and fry <b>Garlic</b> slowly (these are low temperature 
  oils). When it just starts to color, stir in <b>Onion</b> and fry 
  slowly, stirring until translucent but not at all browned, then add 
  <b>Spicing items</b>. Stir 2 minutes more and pour it all into the 
  main pot.</li>
<li>When potatoes are about cooked through (and not before or they'll 
  harden), strain the <b>Sauerkraut</b> from the <b>Brine</b>. Pour the 
  <b>Brine</b> into the pot. Pile the <b>Sauerkraut</b> on your 
  cutting board and cut slices through it about 1-1/2 inches apart, then 
  again at right angles (this makes it easier to eat with a spoon). Stir 
  into the pot.</li>
<li>Strain the <b>Stock</b>, discarding the potato peels and adding the 
  liquid to the pot.</li>
<li>Adjust liquid as you simmer slowly for at least a half hour. It's 
  even better when you reheat the next day. &nbsp; <b><u>Caution</u>:</b> 
  &nbsp; If you use fully pearled barley (see <a href="pov_sauerkraut1.html#02">
  <b>Note-2</b></a>), it tends to burn to the bottom, so use a low flame, 
  a heavy bottomed pot, and keep scraping it up from the bottom.</li>
<li>You can adjust acidity to your taste using sauerkraut juice (best), 
  wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or malt vinegar. <u>Don't</u> use cider 
  vinegar - its flavor conflicts!</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose are ideal for this recipe. They 
  stay quite firm, but also thicken the soup just right. Red potatoes 
  would disintegrate too much. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes like 
  the plague - they'd be mush long before cooking is done. 
  <u>Do Not</u> add Sauerkraut until the Potatoes are nearly fully cooked 
  - acids harden the surface and they don't cook right.For details, see 
  our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; The very white fully pearled barley common in 
  the big supermarkets easily burns to the bottom of the pot and has to 
  be watched very carefully. I now use lightly pearled barley which is 
  much less of a problem. It is a little larger and light beige in color 
  because it is not so severely milled. The big multi-ethnic markets 
  here in Los Angeles carry it.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Dry Red:</h3> &nbsp; I use 3 hot Thai chilis, which are 
  barely detectable in this much soup, but in Southern California it 
  just doesn't seem right to make soup without chilis.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp; Back when I originally wrote up this 
  recipe (2004) I had abandoned Claussen, which had become absurdly 
  expensive for cooking. I was using Meter's Wisconsin Kraut, but this 
  fine product, is now discontinued. Fortunately, today (2013) we can 
  select from many fine brands imported from Poland. My favorite brand 
  is Vitarol, because it is packed with plenty of brine - some brands 
  are too dry. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_skrautz.html"><b>Sauerkraut</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Long ago, in my vegetarian days, I was 
  unwilling to give up the Sauerkraut Soup I had so enjoyed in my 
  childhood. I developed this version - and since I'm a pure child 
  of the Polish - Lthuanian Commonwealth, I'm claiming it as 
  "authentic". I still prefer it to meat versions, and often make a 
  full recipe on the day of the first heavy rain of the year. It is, 
  of necessity, more complex than the traditional version, but it's not 
  difficult to make. It is, however, tricky to get the flavor right in 
  small batches, so make the full recipe - it'll keeps well (even days 
  at a cool room temperature) and reheats well - and you'll be eating 
  a lot more of it than you anticipate anyway. For a traditional version, 
  see <a href="pom_sauerkraut2.html"><b>Sauerkraut Soup - 
  Polish</b></a>.</li>
