Over 90% of Poles are Roman Catholic, and many in Poland still follow 
the Church calandar. There are many meatless days, so good Vegetable 
Stock is in demand. See also <a href="pov_vstock1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
<ol>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> Medium. </li>
<li>Slice <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>PARSLEY ROOT</b> about 1/4 inch thick. 
  Mix. They need not be peeled.</li>
<li>Trim and clean <b>Celery Root</b>. It is not necessary to peel it 
  as you would for a salad. Don't even worry about sand or stones, 
  they'll fall to the bottom of the pot. Cut <b>Celery Stems</b> into 
  about 1 inch lengths. Add both to Carrots.</li>
<li>Cut <b>LEEK</b> coarsely. Rinse if suspected of harboring sand 
  or mud. Add to Carrots.</li>
<li>Cut <b>CABBAGE</b> into wedges with the leaves held together by 
  the core. Add to Carrots.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a suitable (5 quart) heavy bottomed pot, heat <b>Butter</b> and 
  fry <b>Onions</b> over moderate heat until translucent. Stir in all 
  <b>Vegetables</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil then turn heat 
  down to a simmer. Stir in all <b>Seasoning items</b>. Simmer for at 
  least an hour, or up to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
<li>Strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing with the back of a 
  wooden spoon to force out as much water as possible. Discard all 
  solids. You can then clear the surface using your gravy separator.
  </li>
<li>If you will not be using it for awhile, see our recipe 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> for a good 
  storage method.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id=01>
  <h3>Parsley Root:</h3> &nbsp; This can be pretty hard to find in many 
  parts of North America. If you can't get it, use about the same weight 
  of <b>Parsnip</b> and add a few more sprigs of Parsley. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/py_parsz.html#root"><b>Parsley Root</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id=02>
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; [Celeriac] &nbsp; This thickened stem 
  (not actually a root) is much used in Poland and Germany. It can be 
  found in many North America produce markets. While they must be avoided 
  for salads, larger units with thick stems can be used here. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id=03>
  <h3>Celery &amp; Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use stems and leaves 
  from the Celery Root, as these have much more flavor than regular 
  Celery. If you have only regular Celery, use the stems above the 
  first joint, which you don't use for most recipes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Leek:</h3> &nbsp; for this recipe you can use the greens and 
  partially green part of the stem, saving the white and light green 
  for other recipes.</li>
<li id=05>
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Oil could also be used, if you want it more 
  Vegan, In Poland either can be used, even during Lent, as Poland is not 
  under the strict Lent laws of the Eastern Church, where all cooking 
  fats and oils are forbidden - all except Sunflower Seed Oil, which came 
  from the New World long after the prohibition list was composed. I 
  would use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin).</li>
<li id=06>
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This stock is fairly strong. For some 
  soups you may need to add some water. Soup recipes with ingredients 
  that absorb water, such as grains or pasta, will definitely need 
  added water to compensate. Note that no Salt is included, as that 
  is properly added to the recipe the stock is used in.</li>
