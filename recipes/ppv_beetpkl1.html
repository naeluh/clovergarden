  <ol>
  <li>Scrub <b>BEETS</b> but leave on at least an inch of leaf stems and 
    the root. Boil in water to cover until just done through. Determine 
    this by running a sharp skewer through the center of the largest one 
    - it should not encounter a hard spot.</li>
  <li>Cool the <b>Beets</b> one by one under cold running water, 
    sufficiently to handle. Rub off the skins and cut out any grungy 
    bits (they are much harder to peel cold).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets></b> about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Beet Slices</b> in layers in a non-reactive bowl. 
    Interspace each layer with some of the <b>Horseradish</b> and 
    Caraway Seeds. I use a wide bowl and 2 Beets per layer.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b> and bring to a boil. Simmer for a 
    couple minutes to make sure Sugar and Salt are dissolved, then 
    pour over the <b>Beets</b>.</li>
  <li>Let Cool, then refrigerate for 24 hours (or at least a few hours).
    They'll keep more than a week refrigerated in a sealed container.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; It is best to buy smaller beets, as large ones 
    can be more fibrous. Try for 3 inches or less. Beets with greens are 
    more expensive than storage  beets, but have better flavor. In any 
    case, if without greens, the beets should at least show some life, 
    like a bit of greens starting to sprout. Those that have the whole 
    top cut off will be inferior in flavor due to long storage, and will 
    bleed their redness into the cooking water.</li>
  <li id="02">
    <h3>Horseradish:</h3> &nbsp; Grated fresh Horseradish root is best, 
    but can be hard to find in many regions. Prepared horseradish can 
    be used, but must not be plain with vinegar, not with cream, that's 
    English style.</li>
  <li id="03">
    <h3>Caraway Seed:</h3> &nbsp; Some people use 5 whole cloves rather 
    than the caraway seeds. I have a Norwegian recipe that uses half 
    of each.</li>
  <li id="04">
    <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I have cut the pattern recipe's sugar by 1/3. 
    Eastern European, Scandinavian and Asian recipes often call for much 
    more sugar than I can tolerate. I don't want my food to taste like 
    candy. You may restore the full Tablespoon if you wish.</li>
