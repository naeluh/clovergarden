White Cabbage Sauerkraut is a very popular naturally fermented vegetable all 
through the Baltic and Eastern European regions - but see also our recipe 
for <a href="ppv_skred1.html"><b>Red Cabbage Sauerkraut</b></a>.

All materials, tools and containers used in making this ferment must be 
sterile - except the Cabbage, which must not be sterilized.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4+ days - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Quarter <b>CABBAGE</b> lengthwise and cut out the core. Slice very 
    thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Pound the Cabbage to break up the fibers a bit. I spread it on the 
    cutting board and use the smooth side of a kitchen mallet.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Cabbage</b> in a non-reactive bowl and sprinkle the 
    <b>Salt</b> over. Massage it in well.</li>
  <li>Place in a non-reactive bowl and place a dish over the top to weight it 
    down a bit. A little weight on top of the dish will work well. Let it sit 
    for 16 to 24  hours.</li>
  <li>Pack the <b>Cabbage</b> tightly in a jar or jars leaving some head 
    room so you can fit a weight in to keep the Cabbage submerged. All 
    liquid from the salting bowl goes into the jar.</li>
  <li>Make the Brine if needed. In my experience White Cabbage produced a 
    lot of free brine at first, but became dry and needed more brine in a 
    a day or two. Place <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b> in a pan and bring 
    to a boil. Let it sit until cool, then pour as much as needed into the 
    jars to cover the Cabbage completely.</li>
  <li>Place a weight in the jar to hold down the Cabbage - it will float up 
    as it ferments. There are many weighting schemes, but I use a small, 
    tightly sealed plastic bag (2 mil) filled with water and fitted to the 
    jar.</li>
  <li>Place the jar in a location away from heat and light. If your jar is 
    very full, put a dish under it to catch any liquid that escapes.</li>
  <li>Let sit for at least 3 days, then sample to see if the sourness is 
    right. When it is how you like it, tighten the lid and refrigerate. If 
    you use a very clean fork to get some out when you need it, it will 
    keep refrigerated for a couple of months.</li> 
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage, White:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for a whole head with core. Select 
  heads that are of moderate size, solid, and heavy, without blemishes or 
  spoiled leaves.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for salt of table salt consistency, but 
  without additives such as flow agents or anti-caking agents. These can 
  cloud pickles. Korean Sea Salt for making Kimchee is ideal, and available 
  in any Korean market. You can use Diamond Crystal brand Kosher salt which 
  has no anti-caking agents, but it is very fluffy, so the measure should be 
  just over twice what it would be for table salt. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/salt.html"><b>Salt</b></a> page.</li>
