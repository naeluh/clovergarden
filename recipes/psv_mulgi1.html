This mash of Potatoes cooked with Barley originated in southern 
Estonia around 1850, and is practically the "national dish" of Estonia 
today. See also <a href="psv_mulgi1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 minutes work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BARLEY</b>. If natural Groats (whole grain, husked barley), 
    soak overnight. If lightly pearled, (light beige color), soak for 3 
    hours. If heavily pearled (white) soak 1 hr.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs or so for lightly 
    pearled barley, longer for husked, shorter for heavily pearled)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into chunks.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan, place <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Barley</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Cover with water by about 1-1/2 inches. Bring to a boil, cover 
    tightly, and simmer for about 40 minutes. Stir and scrape the bottom 
    to make sure nothing is sticking. Continue to simmer, scraping 
    increasingly often until barley is quite tender and just about all 
    water is absorbed. If the water is about gone, and the barley isn't 
    as tender as you want, stir in boiling water .</li>
  <li>Add <b>Butter</b> to the pot and crush the Potatoes and Barley 
    together thoroughly. An old fashioned potato masher (no - not the 
    German hand grenade) is very useful here. Do not attempt to use an 
    immersion blender.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; (1/2 hr from serving time) 
    <ol>
    <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into small dice.</li>
    <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium.</li>
    <li>Melt <b>Lard</b> or heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Bacon</b>, stirring 
      until lightly browned, then stir in <b>Onions</b> and continue to 
      fry stirring until they are golden.</li>
      </ol>
   <li>Serve hot. Often this is with a dent in the top of the Mulgipuder 
     filled with the Bacon mix, with Sour Cream and Pickles beside it.
     Some people stir the Bacon mix in. This dish reheats well in the 
     oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; This can be had in three conditions. Natural 
  Groats (hulled barley) are the whole grain, simply husked, and are  
  often used for sprouting and production of "barley grass". They are 
  not much found in normal markets here in Southern California. Lightly 
  Pearled Barley is still a beige color, and gives much less trouble 
  with sticking while cooking than heavily pearled. This form is very 
  common in the ethnic markets here in Southern California. Heavily 
  Pearled Barley is the white form found in supermarkets. It cooks 
  faster than lightly pearled, but is a real cooking problem due to 
  sticking to the bottom of the pan. The photo example is made with 
  Lightly Pearled Barley. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potato:</h3> &nbsp; I've reviewed at least a dozen recipes for 
  this dish, all of which call for Potatoes, but not one tells what kind. 
  I used White Rose, an "all purpose" potato, and it worked fine. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes, they disintegrate into mush if cooked longer 
  than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; For those wedded to British terminology, 
  "Bacon" on this site is what you folks call "Streaky Bacon". It's 
  from the pig's belly, not its back, and it's salt cured and smoked. 
  The stuff you folks call "Bacon" we call "Canadian Bacon". Eh?</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp; for the purpose of this recipe, these may 
  be pickled cucumbers, pickled cabbage, or any other vegetable pickles 
  of your choice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Estonia, this dish may be served either 
  as a main dish with sides, or as a side dish to other main dishes.  
  It can be made vegetarian, or even vegan. A lady who teaches vegan 
  cooking in Estonia uses fried dice of eggplant instead of bacon, 
  sunflower oil instead of butter, and accompanies it with sunflower 
  seed "sour cream". </li>
