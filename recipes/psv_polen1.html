This dish is essentially identical to the Mamaliga of Romania and the 
Kacamak of Bulgaria. It is much lighter and easier to make than Italian 
polenta, because of the coarse corn meal.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + cooling time)
  <ol>
  <li>Bring <b>Water</b> to a boil. Stir in <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Butter</b>.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Cornmeal</b> very gradually, stirring constantly in the same 
    direction and keeping the water at a boil (see <a href="psv_polen1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Simmer over very low heat, stirring frequently until the cornmeal 
    thickens, becomes elastic and starts to pull away from the sides of 
    the pot (25 to 35 minutes). 
  <li>Serve hot, or pour into a buttered pan. When cool, turn out 
    and cut as desired. If at all warm, cut with a thread as it will 
    stick to knives.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cornmeal:</h3> &nbsp; Coarse to very coarse yellow cornmeal is 
  always used, never fine cornmeal as for Italian Polenta. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Ukrainians make this in a heavy cast iron pot 
  with a "U" shaped bottom. They stir it with a special long handled 
  wooden spoon. I use a large saucepan with a heavy multi-ply bottom. 
  It has sharper corners, so I stir with a flat wooden spatula, which 
  is also good at scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent burning.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Options</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>Sprinkle the Mamalyga with thinly sliced onions that have been 
    very lightly browned in butter.</li>
  <li>Mamalyga is often served garnished with Bryndza Sheep Cheese. 
    Due to lack of availability in North America, it sometimes faked up 
    by beating together Bulgarian Feta (Sirene) and Farmer's Cheese, half 
    and half, and perhaps some butter, but no more than 1/4 as much as 
    there is cheese.</li>
  <li>A slice of ham can be sandwiched between two squares of Mamalyga. 
    This is then dipped in beaten egg and fried in butter until golden 
    brown.</li>
  <li>Mamalyga can be made in honey sweetened milk or cream rather 
    than water, then topped with fruit preserves and served as desert.
    </li>
  <li>Slices or sticks are often fried with bacon for breakfast.</li>
  </ul>
