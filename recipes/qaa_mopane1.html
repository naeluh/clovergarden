I have not been able to test this recipe yet, as Mopanes are "out of stock" 
in North America. The photo doesn't represent the recipe as it's a simpler 
version without tomatoes, but it's the only decent photo available. This 
recipe is fairly typical of Zimbabwe, but very similar recipes are found in 
the rest of Southern Africa, and even into D.R. Congo and Angola.</p>
  <b><u>DoAhead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 to 3 hours)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>MOPANE</b> in a heatproof bowl and boil up plenty of Water. 
    Pour the water over the Mopane and let soak for an hour or more - 
    see <a href="qaa_mopane1.html#04"><b>Soaking and Cooking Time</b></a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into threads, then cut 
    threads crosswise very fine.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> lengthwise in quarters. Slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and briefly fry <b>Ginger</b> 
    just until aromatic, then stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Curry Powder</b> and <b>Tomatoes</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Tomatoes are soft and liquid is nearly evaporated. </li>
  <li>Drain <b>Mopanes</b> and stir in. Cover and simmer until they are 
    softened to your liking. Add a small amount of Water if needed. See 
    <a href="qaa_mopane1.html#04"><b>Soaking and Cooking Time</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Nshima or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mopane Worms:</h3> &nbsp; These are usually salted and dried. They 
  are available on-line in North America in season, but are sold out for 
  most of the year. They are expensive here, the amount needed for this 
  recipe will set you back about 2021 US $135, when you can get them. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ai_mopanez.html"><b>Mopane Worms</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Most of the Southern Africa region was under 
  British rule long enough that a Madras Curry Powder should do fine. Sun 
  and Ship are good brands, but even better is our recipe 
  <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Nshima:</h3> &nbsp; [Sadza, Mielie pap] &nbsp; This very thick corn 
  flour (maize flour) porridge is the Ugali of Southern Africa, eaten with 
  almost every meal. For details see our recipe <a href="qsv_nshima1.html">
  <b>Nshima</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Soaking and Cooking Time</h3> &nbsp; This can vary quite a bit depending 
  on how softened you like your Mopanes. Some give a long soak (3 hours or 
  more), then give them a short cooking so they still are a little crunchy. 
  Others give a longer cooking time so they are well softened.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Names:</h3> &nbsp; These caterpillers are popular all over Southern 
  Africa, which is home to many tribes, thus they have many names. &nbsp; 
  <i>Mahonja, Phane</i> (Botswana); <i>Masotsa, mashonzha, matamani, masonja, 
  iinnondo</i> (South Africa); <i>Muyaya, finkubala, ifishimu</i> (Zambia); 
  Madora, Amacimbi, Macimbi Masodya, Mashonja, Mahonja (Zimbabwe); 
  <i>Omagungu, Oshuungu (Namibia); Mingolo</i> (D.R. Congo).</li>
