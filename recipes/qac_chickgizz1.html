Gizzards are costly gourmet items in Africa, but quite affordable in 
North America, as few people here know what to do with them. This salad 
is highly portable and served at room temperature.

  <li>Clean <b>GIZZARDS</b> and cut into bite size chunks, remembering 
    they'll shrink a bit. You can start them cooking now.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and <b>GINGER</b>, chop fine and mix. I usually 
    pound it to paste in a big mortar after chopping.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>CHILIS</b> and mix with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pilau Masala</b>.

  <li>In a tightly covered saut&eacute; pan simmer <b>Gizzards</b> slowly, 
    with just enough water to keep them from sticking to the pan (see 
    <a href="qac_chickgizz1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Simmer until tender - about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. 
    Stir and check water often.</li>
  <li>Boil out any remaining water, add <b>Oil</b> and fry stirring a minute 
    or so, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring over moderate 
    heat until garlic is fully cooked.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Masala Mix</b>, then <b>Lime Juice</b> until well 
    blended.</li>
  <li>Serve as an appetizer with lime slices and plenty of beer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Arbols or Thai chili are 
  fine. The amount given will make this recipe medium spicy by Southern 
  California standards, but some from the Frozen North may find it too 
  much. If all you have is Japones use more. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chili Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pilau Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This highly aromatic East 
  African masala is related to the garam masalas of northern India, but 
  differs significantly. For a recipe see our 
  <a href="qys_pilaumas1.html"><b>Pilau Masala</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken Gizzards</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in many markets 
  serving ethnic populations. North American gizzards are almost always 
  frozen or "formerly frozen" and exude quite a bit of water when cooked. 
  At the start, you may have to cook uncovered for awhile to bring 
  the liquid level down.</li>
