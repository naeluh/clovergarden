A very tasty and attractive appetizer. The "California" part is my 
presentation. This recipe is a very simple version of a dish variously made in South Africa. See also

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peri-peri Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Real Peri-peri are tiny Bird Chilis, and 
  hotter'n the hearth grates of Hades. The amount given here makes the liver 
  "noticeably hot" by Southern California standards, but certainly not 
  extrerme. Use your own best judgement about what Chili Powder to use and 
  how much - but the name of the recipe implies significant chili. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Soft Rolls:</h3> &nbsp; French Rolls were used in the photo example, 
  cut an inch or more thick. The pattern recipe did it different, calling for 
  "small rolls" cut and left hinged, opened, buttered, the Chicken Liver 
  spooned inside, then closed and served with a salad. These are properly 
  Portuguese Rolls, not found here in Southern California. I have also seen 
  recipes using Portuguese Rolls cut and served "open face", but less formal 
  than my presentation here.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; Since my presentation is "open face", a garnish 
  is appropriate. That used for the photo was slices of cucumber and finely 
  diced Red Fresno chili, and it worked very well.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; While widely popular in South Africa, in various 
  forms, this recipe is admittedly Portuguese. It was likely adopted from the 
  former Portuguese colony of Mozambique, just northeast of South Africa. In 
  South Africa it is often prepared with a lot of sauce and served as a main 
  dish. Portuguese Rolls are "official", but other breads, plain or toasted, 
  are also used, and some folks serve saucier versions with rice.</li>
