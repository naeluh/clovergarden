These fritters are more often made by street vendors or restaurants 
than in the home, as they are a bit of a production. I have broken 
this recipe into three stages, with clean-up between stages.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef, Ground:</h3> &nbsp; 85% lean is good. 
  Leaner than that will lack flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is best made 
  with starchy potatoes such as Russets. Avoid Yukon Gold  and waxy 
  potatoes which can become heavy or slimy in applications of this sort.
  For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serrano Chili:</h3> &nbsp; In East Africa, 
  green Cayennes would probably be used, but they are imperfectly 
  available in North America, thus we use a Serrano. One Serrano 
  givers the Cutlets just a hint of hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable high temperature 
  frying oil such as Olive Pomace or Peanut Oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Reheating:</h3> &nbsp; While best served hot, 
  these can be made ahead, refrigerated, and reheated by various means: 
  on a baking sheet in the oven, in a skillet, an electric skillet, 
  toaster oven, or whatever you have, provided they are reheated at 
  a fairly high temperature and <u>uncovered</u>. No additional oil 
  is needed as they have enough to prevent sticking. Reheating them 
  makes them an excellent breakfast of quick lunch, served with hot 
  sauce or chutney.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Unlike potato latkes, 
  these don't splatter. They are rather fragile, so at all steps I 
  handle them with a thin metal slotted flat turner under, and a wooden 
  spatula on top to control them as they are turned. They need to be pan 
  fried as they need the support of the pan. DON'T forget the egg dip, 
  or they're likely to disintegrate in the pan. They fry rather slowly, 
  even if you keep the oil at around 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. If you use a 
  12 inch skillet, you can fry about 5 at a time and have the frying 
  step done in 45 minutes. When they are done inside, they will look 
  a bit puffy, but you may want a little more time for browning 
  depending on thickness. </li>
