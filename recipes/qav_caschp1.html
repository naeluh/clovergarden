Similar to Potato Chips, these chips are much easier to make because they 
don't splatter when deep fried. They are probably also lower in calories 
because they are more dense and don't absorb so much oil.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>CASSAVA</b> and slice <u>very thin</u> and <u>very 
    evenly</u>, like potato chips. Use a mandolin or similar device.</li>
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or other suitable pan, heat deep fry <b>Oil</b> 
    to about 370&deg;F/188&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Cassava Chips</b> to the oil in modest batches, making 
    sure they are not stuck together. I deal them into the oil like 
    cards, 25 to 30 at a time. Tumble them with your spider so they fry 
    evenly. Listen to the bubbling. At one point it will decrease to 
    almost none. At this point they are done, and should be a light 
    blonde color. Pull them out with your spider. Don't worry that 
    some may be lighter, they're all done if you tumbled them well. 
    Darkness can depend on where on the root they were cut from.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with <b>Pilipili Masala</b> or <b>Salt</b>. Let them 
    cool before serving. They can be kept a week or two in a tightly 
    sealed plastic bag.</li>
</ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cassava Root:</h3> &nbsp; Despite the heavy wax coating these 
  roots spoil rather quickly, so buy from a store with high turnover 
  and make sure the root is very firm from end to end - then use it 
  very soon.  For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
 <h3>Deep Fry Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good high 
  temperature frying oil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pilipili Masala:</h3> &nbsp; Make this with 
  Citric Acid for sprinkling. See our recipe 
  <a href="qys_pilipil1.html"><b>Pilipili Masala</b></a>. You could 
  also use plain salt, but will be missing interesting flavors.</li>
