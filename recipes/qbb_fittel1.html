This surprisingly delicious dish with delightfully contrasting textures can

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>If not on hand, make <b>Injera Bread</b>. Our recipe  
    <a href="qeg_injerf1.html"><b>Injera - Fast</b></a> works fine, and 
    makes a lot of bread.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>Injera</b> into strips about 3/4 inch wide and 1 to 2-1/2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Dry pan toast <b>FLAX SEEDS</b> until aromatic and starting to pop. 
    pour out on a plate to cool.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> quite fine, about 1/8 inch or finer dice, but 
    definitely not processor fine. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Cap and seed <b>SERRANO</b> and chop very fine, but, again, not 
    processor fine. Mix with Tomatoes.
  <li>Do the same to another <b>Serrano</b> or two for Garnish.</li>
  <li>Grind cooled <b>Flax Seeds</b> to flour by whatever means you have. 
    I use an Indian <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> which does 
    the whole job in about 3 seconds.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Water</b> into a large mixing bowl, and whisk in <b>Flour</b> 
    about 1/4 cup at a time to make a smooth slurry. If you mix water into 
    flour, you'll get lumps you won't be able to get rid of.</li>
  <li> Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Tomato mix</b> until well distributed. 
    Adjust water if needed, it should be a fairly loose slurry.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Injera</b> and tumble gently until well embedded in the sauce.
    </li>
  <li>Refrigerate until chilled and set, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve cold. You may wish to serve the Serrano Garnish on the side to 
    be added as desired. Leftover FitFit can be kept refrigerated for a 
    couple of days.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Injera Bread:</h3> &nbsp; Left over Injera from the fridge works fine 
  here. That used in the photo example was by our recipe 
  <a href="qeg_injerf1.html"><b>Ijera - Fast</b></a> and had been 
  refrigerated for several days.</li>
  <li id="02">
  <h3>Flax Seed:</h3> &nbsp; Whole flax seed comes in colors from reddish 
  brown to light golden. Brown is most common in Ethiopia, but the photo 
  example was made with a medium golden. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/vi_flaxz.html"><b>Flax / Flaxseed</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; One chopped fine will not be a problem for 
  most people. One or two more chopped fine can be served on the side to be 
  applied as desired.</li>
