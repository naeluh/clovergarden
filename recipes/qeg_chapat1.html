In India, Chapatis are made from whole wheat Ata flour, but all my East 
African cookbooks call for using white all-purpose flour.

Here in North America, where there is usually only one person doing the 
cooking, and after work at that, making Chapatis from scratch is simply 
not practical.  Fortunately, here in Southern California, we can buy 
them at the store - sold as "Wheat Tortillas". The photo examples (two 
sizes) have simply been heated on a hot comal - a Mexican rimless steel 
plate, similar to an Indian Tava, but without any curvature. Unthinkable 
a few decades back, even Indian women now buy Chapatis at the store, made 
on the same machines as Whole Wheat Tortillas.</p>
<p>Because Purists always strive to make life more difficult for 
themselves, and for others, we include here a simple recipe for 
African Chapatis, and some notes on more elaborate versions.

  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>Flour</b> in a large bowl and make a well in the center. 
    </li>
  <li>Pour <b>Salt</b> and <b>Oil</b> in the well. Knead it all 
    together into a soft sticky dough.</li>
  <li>Heavily flour your board. Place the <b>Dough</b> on it and 
    start kneading, sprinkling more flour over the Dough a little at 
    a time until it is elastic, smooth, and soft, but not sticky.</li>
  <li>Divide the dough into 6 to 8 balls as desired. Cover with 
    plastic and let them rest for about 1 hour to develop the gluten.
    </li>
  <li>Roll the dough balls out into rounds, a little less than 1/4 
    inch thick.</li>
  <li>Lightly brush <b>Oil</b> onto a Comal or similar (the Lodge 90G 
    round cast iron griddle is excellent) and heat it hot, but not to 
    smoking. Place a round of <b>Dough</b> on the Comal and fry until 
    browned spots start to appear. Meanwhile, brush the top of the 
    dough lightly with oil. Turn over and continue to fry until browned 
    spots start to appear.</li>
  <li>Remove from the pan and set aside, keeping covered to keep warm.
    Repeat with the remaining dough balls.</li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ghee or Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee is fully clarified 
  Butter. It must be heated for use, and will have fewer sticking 
  problems than Oil, but Oil is good enough.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some people use half 
  Water and half Coconut Milk to make a richer Chapati. Others make 
  layered Chapatis by lightly oiling the round, powdering it with 
  flour on both sides, then fan folding it into a narrow strip. The 
  strip is then curled into a spiral ball. The ball is flattened and 
  rolled out into into a circle again, about 1/4 inch thick. The 
  circle is then fried like any other Chapati.</li>
