Injera is the bread of Ethiopia &amp; Eritrea. It requires Teff flour and 1 
to 7 days fermenting. This version can be made quickly with easy to get 
ingredients - see <a href="qeg_injerf1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.

diameter.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Select a mixing bowl much larger than you think is needed, because, 
    when you mix in the vinegar it will foam up enthusiastically. I use an 
    11-1/2 inch (8 quart) medium depth stainless steel bowl.</li>
  <li>Start your griddle warming to about 430&deg;F/220&deg;C so it will be 
    ready and stabilized by time the batter is ready. I recommend an 
    <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html#ir"><b>Infrared Thermometer</b></a> to 
    confirm temperature.</li>
  <li>Mix together both <b>Flours</b>, <b>Baking Soda</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Whisk together until even. If you did this in you big mixing bowl, 
    pour it into another bowl for now.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Club Soda</b> into the empty mixing bowl. If you have just one 
    bottle, add a little regular water to make 4-1/2 cups.</li> 
  <li>Stir <b>Flour mix</b> into the <b>Water</b> a scoop at a time, whisking 
    it in so as to avoid lumps. Don't add water to flour or you will have 
    lumps you can't get rid of. You should have a batter that pours quite 
    freely, so add more water if needed. </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Make sure everything is ready to go.</li>
  <li>Quickly stir the <b>Vinegar</b> into the <b>Batter</b> until it is 
    evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>With your griddle up to temperature, moisten a lump of paper towel 
    with <b>Oil</b> and wipe it around so it coats very thin. </li>
  <li>Ladle batter to fill a small pitcher or 2 cup measuring cup. Pour 
    batter onto the griddle in a thin stream from about 5 inches over the 
    griddle. Pour in a spiral close enough so the batter closes any gaps. It 
    should be about 9 inches diameter, unless you want some other size 
    (see <a href="qeg_injerf1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Cover the pan and let cook for about 5 minutes, or until the edges start 
    to lift off the griddle and the top is well set. If you have made it 
    without a cover, you may need to flip it over for another 1 to 2 minutes. 
    Lift off the griddle and set aside. Best to set it on a straw mat for a 
    few minutes so it can steam off on both sides, then move to a plate. </li>
  <li>Re-oil the pan and repeat until you have used all the batter.</li>
  <li>Serve at room temperature - see <a href="qeg_injerf1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>. 
    Leftover Injera can be sealed in plastic and refrigerated for a couple 
    days. It will eventually get crumbly.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Buckwheat Flour:</h3> &nbsp; The color of this Injera is governed by 
  the buckwheat flour used. Whole Grain Buckwheat Flour from Bob's Red Mill 
  will produce very dark Injera, while Anthony's Organic Buckwheat Flour will 
  produce a much lighter Injera, more like Teff. The Flavor of Anthony's is 
  a little lighter. For examples, see <a href="qeg_injerf1x.html">
  <b>Gallery</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Club Soda:</h3> &nbsp; This product is a faked up Carbonated Mineral 
  Water. I use a bottle of real Gerolsteiner carbonated Mineral Water which 
  I always have on hand, and a little regular water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a high temperature oil like Olive Pomace, as 
  griddle temperature can get high.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Spreading Batter:</h3> &nbsp; If you are using a light 10 inch 
  pan, you can just pour in about 6 inches diameter, then tilt the pan to 
  spread it out to 9 inches. You don't want to spread the batter with a 
  spatula, as that will break the surface bubbles. In Ethiopia, they pour 
  the spiral from the outside in, but they're making it about 2 feet in 
  diameter and are highly skilled. It's easier for us to pour from the 
  center out.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Ethiopia and Eritrea, Injera bread is served 
  with practically every meal. Traditionally, a very wide disk of Injera 
  is the tablecloth with food dabbed on top. Pieces of Injera are torn off 
  and used to pick up foods and sauces. When the food is gone, the rest of the 
  Injera is eaten and dinner is over.  Today, it is common to place a disk 
  of Injera on an individual plate, with foods served over, and a couple 
  half rolls of Injera on the side.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, this version is not made from Teff Flour, 
  but it's still Injera. Many people in Ethiopia and Eritrea cannot afford 
  expensive Teff Flour and use other flours. This recipe gets its sourness 
  from vinegar rather than 3 to 7 days fermenting. It is derived from one by 
  Sommer Collier at www.aspicyperspective.com/. See also the closely related 
  <a href="qeg_lahoh1.html"><b>Canjeero / Lahoh / Anjero</b></a> 
  which takes overnight fermenting, as it's not expected to be as sour.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Recipe Uses:</h3> &nbsp; Injera is used in recipes, such as our 
  <a href="qmm_cowfir1.html"><b>Beef Firfir Stew</b></a> and 
  <a href="qbb_fittel1.html"><b>Injera with Flaxseed Dressing</b></a>.</li>
