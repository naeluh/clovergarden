<span class=tf>These Injera were made with Anthony's <i>Organic Buckwheat 
Flour</i>. 
<br>They are about as dark as if made with Brown Teff. 
<br>White Teff would make Injera of an even lighter color.</p>

<img src="img/kp_lefse06g.jpg" alt="Lefse Griddle" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>This 16 inch Lefse griddle was used for the example breads. 
In Ethiopia, it would be made on large disk of iron  (formerly clay) over 
a wood fire, but that takes a lot of experience to get the temperatures 
right. A regular 12 inch iron skillet would work if well seasoned, or a 
non-stick pan of similar size. Whatever pan is used, it must have a 
cover. I suggest you have an Infrared Thermometer for accurate temperature 
control. For details on the photo pan see our <a href="../ke/kp_lefsez.html">

<img src="img/ke_injera02g.jpg" alt="Pitcher and Oxo Silicone Turner" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>These are my Injera tools. The stainless steel Pitcher holds 
4 cups, but a 2 cup size would be sufficient and easier to handle. To take 
the bread off the griddle, use a wide turner like Oxo example to the left in 
the photo. If you turn the bread over, you will need another turner to 
steady it, but a narrower one would be fine. If not using a non-stick pan, 
you can use plain metal turners.</span>
