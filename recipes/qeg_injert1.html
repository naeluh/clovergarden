Injera is the bread of Ethiopia &amp; Eritrea. This recipe is the traditional 
method - much more demanding than our <a href="qeg_injerf1.html"><b>Injera 
- Fast</b></a>. See also <a href="qeg_injert1.html#07"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<p>See <a href="qeg_injert1x.html#gal"><b>Gallery</b></a> for tools used 
and more details. These breads weigh about 4 ounces each at 9 inches 
diameter.</p>
  <b><u>Make Yeast Starter - Day 1</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Days 4 - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>In a non-reactive bowl large enough for some expansion, pour 1 cup 
    <b>Water</b> and slowly mix in 2 cups <b>Teff Flour</b> working it to 
    remove all lumps.  Smooth out the batter and carefully pour another 
    1/2 cup water over it. This water should cover the batter completely. 
    Cover the bowl loosely enough to allow some air circulation (I use a 
    plastic bag) and place in a slightly warm location. Leave sit until 
    the 4th day.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make Base Batter - Day 4</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Days 3 - 30 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>The fermenting bowl should have separated into two layers, with liquid 
    on top. Carefully pour off the liquid. What's left is your starter. It's 
    more than you will need for one recipe, but excess can be kept, 
    (see <a href="qeg_injert1.html#05"><b>Starter</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Select a non-reactive bowl large enough for the whole recipe and some 
    expansion. Measure out 1/2 cup of the <b>Starter</b> into this bowl  
    and work in 1 cup of <b>Water</b>. Use your hands so you can feel for 
    lumps.</li>
  <li>Work in 4-1/2 cups (1 # 2 oz) <b>Teff Flour</b> until all even and as 
    lump free as you can get it. Work with your hands so you can feel lumps 
    and crush them. Measure out 2 cups of water and set aside. As you work you 
    may need to add a little from the reserved 2 cups, until it is all 
    included. The batter should end up smooth, lump free, and very thickly 
    creamy.</li>
  <li>Level out the Batter and carefully pour 1-3/4 cups <b>Water</b> over 
    it. This Water should completely cover the Batter.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl and set aside as before, for 3 days. It should be 
    be bubbly and smell yeasty and sour.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make Absit <small>&amp;</small> Final Batter - Day 7</u></b> &nbsp; - 
    &nbsp; - (4-1/2 hrs - 1/2 hr work)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Carefully pour the liquid off the top of the Batter.</li>
  <li>In a sauce pan, bring 1 cup of <b>Water</b> to a boil. Whisk in 1/2 cup 
    of the <b>Base Batter</b> and another 1/2 cup of <b>Water</b>. When this 
    mixture starts to thicken and bubble, take it off the heat and let cool 
    until it is just warm.  This Absit should have the consistency of a thin 
    porridge.</li>
  <li>Stir the <b>Absit</b> into the <b>Base Batter</b> until well distributed. 
    This mix should be just a little thicker than a crepe batter. It will need 
    to pour fairly well. If you dip your fingers into it, it should run off 
    leaving only a coating (see <a href="qeg_injert1x.html#test">
    <b>Gallery</b></a>). Stir in some more Water if it is too thick. If it's 
    thin enough, but you just can't get rid of lumps, you might use an 
    immersion blender ont it, but then you'll need a couple extra hours of 
    final fermentation.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl and set aside until it's fairly bubbly. This can be 2 to 
    6 hours depending on yeast activity, temperature, etc. After there are 
    a fair number of bubbles forming on the surface, it's ready to cook.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make Injera - Day 7</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Start your griddle warming to about 440&deg;F/220&deg;C so it will be 
    ready and stabilized by time you start to cook. I recommend an 
    <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html#ir"><b>Infrared Thermometer</b></a> to 
    confirm temperature.</li>
  <li>With your griddle up to temperature, moisten a lump of paper towel 
    with <b>Oil</b> and wipe it around so it coats very thin. </li>
  <li>Ladle batter to fill a small pitcher or some other device that can pour 
    a thin stream. Pour batter onto the griddle in a thin stream from 6 to 8 
    inches above the griddle. Pour in a spiral close enough so the batter 
    closes any gaps. It should be about 9 inches diameter, unless you want 
    some other size (6 to 15 inches - see <a href="qeg_injert1.html#04"><b>Spreading 
    Batter</b></a>).
      <ul>
      <li><b>Do Not Cover the Pan</b> until you are no longer seeing any more 
        eyes opening on the top surface. Watch the light colored areas.</li>
      <li><b>Cover the Pan</b> and let the Injera cook for awhile. Lift the 
        cover and dump out the steam now and then. Traditional Injera lids 
	have a steam escape hole.</li>
      <li><b>Don't touch</b> the top surface of the Injera, you'll close the 
        eyes and make a dent with even a light touch.</li>
      <li><b>It is Done</b> when it has pretty much stopped steaming, but will 
        still be fairly soft.</li>
      <li><b>Remove it</b> from the griddle using two turners or a very wide 
        device, as it is tender and fragile until well cooled.</li>
      <li><b>Cool</b> the injera, preferably on a straw mat so it can steam 
        off from both sides. When cold, you can stack them on a plate.</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
  <li>Re-oil the pan and repeat until you have used all the batter.</li>
  <li>Serve at room temperature - see <a href="qeg_injert1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>. 
    Leftover Injera can be sealed in plastic and refrigerated for a couple 
    of days. It will eventually get crumbly.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Teff Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Teff flour is easily available on-line in 
  North America. Most of it is Brown Teff, rather than the Ivory Teff 
  preferred in Ethiopia. This may be the reason Mulunesh Belay uses half 
  Teff flour and half Rice Flour, to make a much lighter Injera while 
  maintaining its gluten free nature.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; The water must be chlorine free, as chlorine slows 
  yeast proliferation. If your local water is chlorinated, use bottled water.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a high temperature oil like Olive Pomace or 
  Rice Bran, as griddle temperature may hit as high as 450&deg;F/230&deg;C. 
  in spots.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Spreading Batter:</h3> &nbsp; You need your batter liquid enough to 
  spread to the desired thickness as poured. You don't want to spread the 
  batter with a spatula, as that will destroy the surface bubbles. In 
  Ethiopia, they pour a spiral from the outside in, but they're making it 
  about 2 feet in diameter and are highly skilled. This is probably to 
  compensate for the big clay Mitad being lower temperature at the outer 
  edges, so gives the outer edges a little more cooking time. It's easier 
  for us to pour from the center out.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Ethiopia and Eritrea, Injera bread is served 
  with practically every meal. Traditionally, a very wide disk of Injera 
  is the tablecloth with food dabbed on top and half rolls of Injera on the 
  side. Pieces of Injera are torn off and used to pick up foods and sauces. 
  When the food is gone, the tablecloth is eaten and dinner is over. Today, 
  it is common to place a disk of Injera on an individual plate, with foods 
  on top of it, and a couple half rolls of Injera on the side.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Starter:</h3> &nbsp; The starter can be stored in a sealed jar in the 
  fridge for up to 2 weeks. If left longer, it must be fed every 2 weeks or 
  it will weaken. To do this, pour off any liquid on top. If you haven't 
  been using it, you may need to discard some of the old solids too. Stir 
  in 1/2 cup of Teff Flour and 1/4 cup of water. I see no reason this starter 
  could not be used for other types of sour dough breads as well.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is largely derived from practices 
  given in Yohanis Gebreyesus' book <i>Ethiopia</i> and Mulunesh Belay's 
  <i>Ethiopian Feast</i>, with a large dose of my personal experience. Ms. 
  Belay now makes Injera in her restaurant in Belingham, Washington, using 
  a mix of 1/2 Rice Flour and 1/2 Teff Flour, which produces a much lighter 
  color Injera than shown here. She uses 1/2 cup of starter per 2 pounds of 
  Flour in the Base Batter. She also uses 1 Tablespoon of active dry yeast 
  when making her initial Starter. This may be necessary in climates much 
  cooler than Ethiopia, or in sterile environments lacking sufficient wild 
  yeasts.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Recipe Uses:</h3> &nbsp; Injera is used in recipes, such as our 
  <a href="qmm_cowfir1.html"><b>Beef Firfir Stew</b></a> and 
  <a href="qbb_fittel1.html"><b>Injera with Flaxseed Dressing</b></a>.</li>
