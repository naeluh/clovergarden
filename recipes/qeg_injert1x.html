<br class=cll>
<span class=tf>These Injera were made with Anthony's <i>Premium Teff Flour</i>. 
The Teff Flour<br>preferred in Ethiopia is the ivory type which makes a much 
lighter colored Injera.</span></p>

<img src="img/kp_lefse06g.jpg" alt="Lefse Griddle" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>This 16 inch Lefse griddle was used for the example breads. In 
Ethiopia, it would traditionally be made on a large clay disk called a Mitad, 
over a wood fire. That takes a lot of experience to get the temperatures right. 
A regular 12 inch iron skillet would work if well seasoned, or a non-stick pan 
of similar size. Whatever pan is used, it must have a cover. I suggest you have 
an Infrared Thermometer for accurate temperature control. For details on the 
photo pan see our <a href="../ke/kp_lefsez.html"><b>Lefse Griddle</b></a> 
page.</span>

<img src="img/ke_injera5g.jpg" alt="Pitcher and Oxo Silicone Turners" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>These are my Injera tools. The stainless steel Pitcher holds 
4 cups, but a 2 cup size would be sufficient and easier to handle. To take 
this "all Teff" bread off the griddle, you need a very wide device, or two 
turners like the Oxo examples in the photo. The bread is too tender when hot 
to use just one turner.</span>

<img src="img/qeg_injert03g.jpg" alt="Starter before topping with Water" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Day 1, this is the starter before topping with water. The bowl it is 
in is way larger than needed, as it will expand little.</span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_injert05g.jpg" alt="Starter, water Poured Off" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Day 4, this is the Starter with the water poured off (it's in a 
much smaller bowl now).</span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_injert07g.jpg" alt="Base Batter mixed with Absit" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Day 4, this is the Base Batter mixed with Starter, leveled out 
before topping with water.</span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_injert09g.jpg" alt="Base Batter mixed with Absit" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Day 7, this is the Base Batter mixed with Absit and given a 
couple hours fermentation. It still needed a lot more water to get the right 
consistency, so it needed a few more hours fermenting time after that was 
mixed in.</span>

<p id="test">
<img src="img/qeg_injert11g.jpg" alt="Consistency Test" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Day 7, testing the finished batter. It needs to be quite 
pourable, but thick enough to coat fingers well when they are dipped in.
