This Eritrean flatbread is a lot easier to make than Ethiopian Injira, and a 
lot easier to get the ingredients for. It is fairly thick and fairly chewy, 
as it is not leavened.

  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place both <b>Flours</b> and <b>Salt</b> in a large mixing bowl and 
    whisk together until even.</li>
  <li>Work in <b>Warm Water</b> with your hands until you have a batter like 
    a thick pancake batter. This will take around 2 cups of the Water.</li>
  <li>Divide the batter equally into two separate bowls.</li>
  <li>In a wide non-stick or well seasoned pan, heat 1/2 Tablespoon of 
  <b>Oil</b> and wipe it around with a paper towel so it's very thin. Pour 
    in half the <b>Batter</b> and pat it into shape with wet fingertips.</li>
  <li>Cover the pan and cook until golden brown on the bottom and evenly 
    darkened in the top, then carefully flip it over. Cover and cook until 
    the top side has plenty of browned spots. Lift it out and set on toweling. 
    If using paper towels, don't leave it long or you'll have trouble peeling 
    off the paper.</li>
  <li>Re-oil the pan and repeat with the second half of the <b>Batter</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Serve warm. This bread can be rewarmed in a pan over low heat.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Oil or Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; Ghee is fully clarified Butter. It must be 
  heated for use, and will have fewer sticking problems than Oil, but Oil 
  is good enough.</li>
