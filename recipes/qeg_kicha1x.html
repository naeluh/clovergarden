<span class=tf>This Lefse griddle was used for this recipe. In Africa, 
it would probably made on a circular sheet of iron over a wood fire. A 
regular 12 inch iron skillet would work if well seasoned, or a non-stick 
pan of similar size. Whatever pan is used, it must have a cover. For 
details on this pan see our <a href="../ke/kp_lefsez.html">

<span class=tf>To safely turn this bread over, you should use two 
turners, preferably a wide one to pick up the bread, and another to 
control it as it is turned over. If using a non-stick griddle or pan, 
these Oxo flexible Silicone turners are excellent. If not using a 
non-stick pan, you can use plain metal turners.	</span>

<img src="img/qeg_kicha02g.jpg" alt="Kicha Batter" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>The Kicha Batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake 
batter. This bowl contains a half recipe, ready to pour onto the griddle. 
You will need a spatula to urge it all out of the bowl. This batter was 
made using a light colored whole wheat flour from Bob's Red Mill.</span>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_kicha05g.jpg" alt="Kicha Batter on Griddle" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>This is the Kicha Batter immediately after dumping onto the 
griddle and using wet fingertips to tap it into shape. The cover should be 
immediately placed over the pan.</span>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_kicha08g.jpg" alt="Kicha Ready to Turn Over" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here the Kicha has been cooked covered until it is completely 
darkened on the top and a couple minutes after that point. It can now be 
carefully turned over using two turners.</span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_kicha10g.jpg" alt="Kicha Turned Over" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here the Kicha has been turned over. It will continue to 
cook until it has brown spots on the other side.</span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_kicha14g.jpg" alt="Kichas Finished" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here are three Kichas complete and off the griddle.</span>
