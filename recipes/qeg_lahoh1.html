These breads weigh about 4-1/2 ounces each. Figure they will take about 
9 minutes each for cooking and waiting for temperature to recover.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-5 hours - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Select a mixing bowl that will accommodate some expansion. I use an 
    11-1/2 inch medium depth stainless steel bowl.</li>
  <li>Place <b>CORNMEAL</b>, <b>Yeast</b>, and 2 cups <b>Water</b> in the 
    mixing bowl. Whip well to blend. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour 
    or a little more.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Baking Soda</b> and <b>Salt</b> into the mixing bowl, then 
    start mixing in the <b>FLOUR</b> a few ounces at a time, whipping it in 
    with a wire whisk.</li>
  <li>Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a cloth and let sit in a comfortably 
    warm place for 3 to 4 hours, or until it is quit foamy.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Adjust liquid in your batter if necessary so it pours fairly well. If 
    you have to stir in more Water, let it sit for another 30 minutes to 
    restore bubbles.</li>
  <li>Make sure everything is ready to go.</li>
  <li>Bring your griddle up to about 400&deg;F/200&deg;C and give it time to 
    stabilize. I recommend an <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html#ir"><b>Infrared 
    Thermometer</b></a> to confirm temperature.</li>
  <li>Wipe the surface of the griddle with a lump of paper towel soaked with 
    <b>Oil</b>. I do this even on my non-stick griddle.</li>
  <li>Pour on about 4-1/2 ounces of the batter. Then tilt the pan around to 
    spread it out to about 9 inches (see <a href="qeg_lahoh1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). 
    </li>
  <li>Cover the pan and let cook for about 4 minutes, or until the edges start 
    to lift off the griddle and the top is set so you can touch it firmly 
    without it sticking. If your temperature is right, the bottom should be 
    lightly browned. Lift off the griddle and set aside. Best to set it on a 
    straw mat for a few minutes so it can steam off on both sides, them move 
    to a plate.</li>
  <li>Re-oil the pan and repeat until you have used all the batter.</li>
  <li>Serve at room temperature - see <a href="qeg_lahoh1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>. 
    Bagged in plastic, this bread will keep for days in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cornmeal:</h3> &nbsp; This should be finely ground White Cornmeal.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; You may notice I call for a lot more water at this 
  point than in most recipes on the Internet. This is from my experience. My 
  first batch used 3 cups as given in the pattern recipe, and was left to 
  ferment overnight, as many recipes call for. It was unusable as the gluten 
  in the flour had linked making it stringy and sticky, impossible to pour or 
  even ladle. 4 cups in the next batch and 3 hours fermenting was much 
  better, but still a little thick and getting thicker. Your flours may need 
  a different amount of water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Spreading Batter:</h3> &nbsp; If you cannot tilt the pan (it's awkward 
  with my large Lefse Griddle), the batter must be liquid enough to spread 
  well, and applied in a spiral as is done for Injira in Ethiopia. You don't 
  want to spread the batter with a spatula, as that will break all the 
  surface bubbles.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This bread is a standard breakfast item throughout 
  the region. It may be topped with butter, ghee, olive oil, sesame oil, 
  sugar or honey. It is also served at lunch and other meals to accompany 
  stews, curries, and soups, instead of rice. Often one disk will be placed 
  flat on the plate, with a another disk rolled up and cut in half on the 
  side. It is also commonly served with tea. It's also excellent as a snack 
  with beer.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Wikipedia says the preferred flour is Sorghum. 
  No recipe I have seen calls for this, they all call for 1 cup Cornmeal and 
  4 cups of All Purpose Flour (or a similar ratio for different quantities). 
  Quite a few do allow additional of 1/2 cup of Sorghum flour mixed in with 
  the Cornmeal as an option. I have seen mention of a "Red Lahoh" made from 
  whole grain sorghum flour, but nobody I've read claims to have actually 
  seen it.</li>
