<span class=tf>This 16 inch Lefse griddle was used for the example breads. 
In Africa, it would probably made on a Tava, circular sheet of iron over 
a wood fire, but that takes a lot of experience to get the temperatures 
right. A regular 12 inch iron skillet would work if well seasoned, or a 
non-stick pan of similar size. Whatever pan is used, it must have a 
cover. I suggest you have an Infrared Thermometer for accurate temperature 
control. For details on the photo pan see our <a href="../ke/kp_lefsez.html">

<span class=tf>To safely handle this bread, you should use a wide turner 
like the Oxo example to the left in the photo. If not using a non-stick 
pan, you can use plain metal turners.</span>
