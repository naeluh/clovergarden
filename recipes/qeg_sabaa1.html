A multi-layered skillet bread of Djibouti and Somalia, similar to an Indian 
Paratha - crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. All the layers will 
separate.

<p>See <a href="qeg_sabaa1x.html#gal"><b>Gallery</b></a> for more details and 
photographic steps. These breads weigh about 4.4 ounces each. Figure they will 
take about 5 minutes each. </p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 40 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Select a large mixing bowl. I use an 11-1/2 inch medium depth stainless 
    steel bowl.</li>
  <li>Place all <b>Dry Ingredients</b> in the mixing bowl and whip together 
    until evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Milk</b> up hot in a saucepan, just until you see a few bubbles 
    form at the edges of the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Milk</b>, then 2 T <b>Oil</b>. Stir until you have a 
    kneadable dough. Adjust by slowly mixing in warm water or additional flour 
    as necessary. You should be able to handle it without it sticking to your 
    hands.</li>
  <li>Dust a work surface with a little <b>Flour</b> and turn out the dough 
    onto it. Knead the dough well, 10 to 15 minutes by hand or 5 minutes in 
    a stand mixer with dough hook. Finally, mold it into a roughly spherical 
    lump.</li>
  <li>Clean your mixing bowl and coat with 1 T <b>Oil</b>. Place the lump 
    of <b>Dough</b> in the bowl and tumble it around to coat with the oil. 
    Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set in a 
    comfortably warm place for 45 minutes to an hour. An oven with just the 
    pilot light on is a good place. It should become a little soft and perhaps 
    just a trace puffy.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Form Sabaayad</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Place the <b>Dough</b> on a lightly floured surface and cut into 8 
    equal pieces. Mold the pieces into balls.</li>
  <li>Working one at a time, use a rolling pin to roll <b>Dough</b> out to 
    into a 1/4 inch thick oval about 9 inches long. Use a brush to coat the 
    top side of the oval with a thin coating of <b>Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Fold the Oval in half, end to end. Now use the brush to coat the top 
    side of the folded oval and fold in half again.</li>
  <li>Using a rolling pin, roll the <b>Folded Dough</b> to about 1/4 inch 
    thick. I didn't like the elongated shape I got, so I oiled again, folded 
    again, and rolled back out to 1/4 inch thick. Repeat until all 8 pieces 
    are done.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Cook Sabaayad</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="12">
  <li>Make sure everything is ready to go.</li>
  <li>Bring your griddle up to about 400&deg;F/200&deg;C and give it time to 
    stabilize. I recommend an <a href="../ke/ke_thermirz.html#ir"><b>Infrared 
    Thermometer</b></a> to confirm temperature.</li>
  <li>Wipe the surface of the griddle with a lump of paper towel soaked with 
    <b>Oil</b>. I do this even on my non-stick griddle.</li>
  <li>Place one or more <b>Sabaayad</b> on the griddle, depending on how much  
    space you have. Let cook until the top layer has mostly bubbled up from 
    the rest of the bread. The steam that forces the bubble up shows it is 
    nearly cooked through. The bottom side should be splotchy with brown 
    spots, medium dark. This will be about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Turn it over and press it down to squeeze out the bubble(s) so the whole 
    top side touches the griddle. Continue to cook until the other side is 
    attractively splotchy brown, as in the photos, another 3 minutes or so. 
    </li>
  <li>Lift the cooked <b>Sabaayad</b> from the griddle and place aside to 
    cool a bit. A straw mat is a good place to let them cool down before 
    stacking.</li>
  <li>Re-oil the pan and repeat until all the Sabaayad are done.</li>
  <li>Serve warm - see <a href="qeg_sabaa1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>. Bagged in plastic, 
    this bread will keep a day at room temperature, or for several days in 
    the fridge. It can be revived by briefly heating on the griddle, 2 or 
    3 minutes per side.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes use Ghee [subag (Somalia), clarified 
  butter] for a richer bread. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="gid_ghee1.html"><b>Ghee &amp; Clarified Butter</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Serve warm. This bread can be easily reheated 
  on the griddle, about 3 minutes per side. Sabaayad can be served at any 
  meal. For breakfast it may be topped with Honey or Ghee. It often 
  accompanies Stews and Curries for lunch or dinner. As a snack, it is 
  often served with honey and tea.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes do not use Milk, only Water. Some   
  recipes use twice as much Sugar as in this recipe, and some use no Sugar 
  at all. Some use only White Flour, but having also Whole Wheat flour makes 
  a more tender Sabaayad. Some recipes use no Baking Powder. One recipe I 
  have, by a lady who cooks them at a restaurant, adds a big handful of 
  chopped cilantro to her dry mix, which is otherwise about the same as 
  here.</li>
