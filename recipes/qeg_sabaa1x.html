<span class=tf>This 16 inch Lefse griddle was used for the example breads, 
and could easily handle three at a time. In Africa, it would probably made 
on a Tava, a circular sheet of iron over a wood fire, but that takes a lot 
of experience to get the temperatures right. A regular 12 inch iron skillet 
would work if well seasoned, or a heavy non-stick pan of similar size. The 
cover is not used for this bread. I suggest you have an Infrared Thermometer 
for accurate temperature control. For details on the photo pan see our 
<a href="../ke/kp_lefsez.html"><b>Lefse Griddle</b></a> page.</span>

<p>
<img src="img/ke_turns02f.jpg" alt="Oxo Silicone Turners" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>To safely handle this bread, you should use a wide turner 
like the Oxo examples in the photo to the left. I use the wide one, but 
this bread is quite durable, so the narrow one would work. If not using 
a non-stick pan, you can use plain metal turners.</span>

<img src="img/qeg_sabaa02f.jpg" alt="Dough ready to be kneaded" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>This dough has been fully mixed in a large pan, and is now on 
the board ready for kneading to begin. Weighs about 2-1/2 pounds, it can be 
handled without sticking. Kneading will take 15 minutes by hand, or about 5 
minutes in a powerful stand mixer with a dough hook. </span>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_sabaa05f.jpg" alt="Dough cut into 8 pieces" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here the Dough, after completion of the kneading step, has 
been cut into 8 pieces of about the same size. </span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_sabaa08f.jpg" alt="Dough formed into 8 balls" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here the 8 pieces of Dough, have been formed into balls and 
are ready to be rolled out. </span>
<br class=cll></p>

<p>
<img src="img/qeg_sabaa11f.jpg" alt="Dough rolled out" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Dough rolled out to about 1/4 inch thick and 9 inches long.

<img src="img/qeg_sabaa23f.jpg" alt="Dough folded again and rolled out" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>I wasn't happy with the elongated shape, so I oiled the top 
again, folded again, and rolled out again.</span>

<img src="img/qeg_sabaa25f.jpg" alt="Sabaayad on the Griddle" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>Here are three Sabaayad on the griddle. Note that the top 
layer is puffed up, so they are ready to turn over.</span>
