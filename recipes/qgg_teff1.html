In Ethiopia, Teff is usually ground to flour for making Injera, but some is 
used as whole grain for porridge and salads. This is an arranged salad rather 
than a tossed salad.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, dry toast the <b>TEFF</b> until aromatic, then 
    pour in 3 cups Water. Bring to a boil, then turn to a simmer and cover. 
    Stir frequently until Teff is tender but still "al-dente", about 15 
    minutes, and all free liquid should have been just absorbed. Pour into 
    a bowl and set aside to cool completely, then refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>MINT</b> fine. Mix. Measure is moderately 
     packed.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>LETTUCE</b> fairly small - weight is for whole heads, before 
    shredding and discarding white stems. Refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHERRY TOMATOES</b> in half crosswise, or crosswise two ways 
    if quite large. Refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE </b> and mix together all <b>Vinaigrette</b> 
     items in a small jar. Refrigerate. </li>
     </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbps; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Fluff the <b>CHEESE</b> with a fork and season <u>sparingly</u> with 
    <b>Mitmita</b>.</li>
  <li>Fluff <b>Teff</b> with a fork and stir in <b>Parsley mix</b>, 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Shake up the <b>Dressing</b> and pour <u>1/4</u> of it into the 
    <b>Teff</b>. Continue to fluff until it is well distributed.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, toss together <b>Lettuce</b> and remaining 
    <b>Dressing</b>.</li>
  <li>Assemble for serving - <b>Lettuce mix</b> as the base, <b>Tomatoes</b> 
    scattered around, <b>Teff</b> in the center, topped with the <b>Cheese</b>. 
    This can be done in individual bowls or in a large shallow serving bowl 
    to be spooned out. Note that the 10 inch bowl in the photo contains 
    lexx than 1/2 of this recipe, and will serve adequately as a lunch salad for 
    two.</li>
  <li>Serve cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Teff:</h3> &nbsp; A staple grain of Ethiopia, now grown in quantity in 
  North America to supply Ethiopian restaurants. It's available on line from 
  several vendors, in both brown and ivory, and from some upscale markets. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_teffz.html"><b>Teff</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lettuce:</h3> &nbsp; This is to be a loose leaf lettuce, preferably 
  one with somewhat curly leaves, or a mix of such lettuces.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cheese, Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a crumbly, acid coagulated, 
  fresh cheese, like Farmers Cheese.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mitmita:</h3> &nbsp; This is the hot chili spice mix of Ethiopia and 
  Eritrea, in comparison to Berbere which is relatively mild. It is simple 
  and easily made by our recipe <a href="qys_mitmita1.html">
  <b>Mitmita Spice Mix</b></a></li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Red or White Wine Vinegar, or Balsamic Vinegar, 
  can be used. These are all "authentic" due to lingering influence from 
  Italian rule of the region.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If this salad is made ahead, or if only part 
  will be served now with the rest later, you can dress all the Teff and 
  prepare all the cheese, but dress only the amount of Lettuce to be used 
  now, bagging the rest and refrigerating. Leftover Teff and Cheese should 
  be separately bagged and refrigerated as well.</li>
