Beets are popular in Ethiopia, considered to be very healthy. A hot

  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs - 40 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> in plenty of water until a sharp skewer will pass 
    through the center of the largest one without hitting a hard spot (1 to 
    1-1/4 hrs). Drain, and hold under cold running water just long enough 
    that your can handle them. Rub the skins off and trim root and top. Let 
    cool. If you let them cool first, you won't be able to rub the skins 
    off.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into sticks about 1/2 inch on a side and 
    1-1/2 to 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Carrots</b> and cut into sticks similar to the potatoes, but a 
    little bit narrower.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Carrots</b> in a saucepan with water enough to cover both 
    Carrots and Potatoes. Bring to a boil for about 3 minutes, then stir 
    in Potatoes. Bring back to a boil, and simmer until Potatoes are just 
    tender. Drain and let cool.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice about 1/4 inch wide 
    crosswise. Separate layers.</li>
  <li>Cap and and seed <b>GREEN CHILIS</b>. Cut into narrow strips about
    1/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Onions</b> in a large bowl and scatter <b>Chilis</b> over them. 
    Layer <b>Carrots mix</b> over the Chilis,</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beets</b> into sticks similar in size to the Potatoes. Layer over 
    the top of the salad. Refrigerate until all is well cooled.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mix all <b>Dressing items</b> in a small 
    jar.</li>
  <li>When nearly ready to serve, Shake up dressing and pour over the salad, 
    then toss the salad gently.</li>
  <li>Serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; For salads, buy moderate size beets with tops on, 
  or at least sprouting new greens. Storage Beets, cut close at the top, 
  are usually old, tough, and flavorless, and very large beets won't be 
  tender. When trimming, leave at least an inch of the stems, which will 
  help keep them from bleeding their color.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or Red Potatoes will work well in 
  this recipe. Even Klondike Gold type potatoes will work, if boiled just 
  enough to be tender. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; While it's not an East African chili, pretty 
  much every Ethiopian recipe in English calls for Jalape&ntilde;os. This 
  chili must satisfy folks who are "from there", so that's what I use. Cored 
  and seeded, they haven't much chili heat.</li>
