Possibly originally from South Africa, and popular there, to the rest of 
the English speaking world it is a "grandmother dish". Usually a cold salad, 
but sometimes a warm side dish.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min + 2-1/2 to 12 hrs cool &amp; chill)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into disks, 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Carrots</b> in a sauce pan with water to cover. Bring to a 
    boil and cook until <b>Carrots</b> are just crisp tender, <u>do not 
    overcook</u>. Drain and refresh under cold water.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Carrots</b> and put into a non-reactive heat-proof bowl large 
    enough for the recipe.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> lengthwise in half. Then cut the half lengthwise as 
    though you were going to chop fine, all the way to the root end but not 
    through the root end. Keep the knife tilted so the edge points to the 
    centerline where the the onion meets the cutting board. Then, instead of 
    slicing crosswise, just cut off the root end. Separate the strands and 
    add to the bowl. </li>
  <li>Cap and core the <b>BELL PEPPER</b>. Slice into strips about 1/4 inch 
    wide and 1 inch long. Add to the bowl</li>
  <li>Tumble all together until evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>In a sauce pan, place all <b>Dressing Items</b> and mix well. Bring 
    to a boil and then simmer covered for about 5 minutes. Pour the hot 
    <b>Sauce</b> over the <b>Salad</b> and let cool. Once cool, refrigerate 
    for at least a couple hours or overnight.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for 7 oz Condensed Tomato 
  Soup, some call for just 7 oz Tomato Soup, some call for 7 oz Tomato Juice. 
  I'm calling for 4 oz of a very simple Tomato Sauce with a little Water. My 
  favorite is "Faraon Spanish Style" which comes in a convenient 8oz can, but 
  other simple sauces will also work, even "Goya Spanish Style" if you're not 
  still boycotting them for publicly endorsing Trump.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is a lot lower in Sugar than any 
  other you will see, but it's more than enough for me. Most recipes have 
  the measure of sugar the same as the measure for vinegar, or even more, 
  sometimes a lot more. It doesn't taste like a salad, it tastes like 
  carrot candy. Increase the amount if you wish, but keep in mind 
  that Sugar is an addictive toxin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some say Copper Penny Salad originated in the 
  American Southeast, others say South Africa. Regardless of origin, it 
  was spread through the English speaking world mainly from South Africa.</li>
