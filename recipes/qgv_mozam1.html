This is not an everyday salad, but one served at celebrations and other 
events - it's excellent for buffet and substantial enough for a lunch salad.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Iceberg Lettuce:</h3> &nbsp; "Crisp head" Lettuce doesn't get much 
  respect these days. It's much lower in vitamins and lower in minerals than 
  loose leaf lettuce, but in this salad it provides a delightful crunchiness, 
  and resists wilt on the buffet table.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use 
  small cucumbers that don't need to be peeled or seeded, such as 
  Persian, Japanese or European. If you have only the standard waxed 
  green blimps, peel them and seed them, then measure out the given 
  weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; For contrast, use a yellow or Red Bell Pepper. 
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fresh Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "Cottage Cheese" 
  which means different things in different places. I use a Russian style 
  Farmer's Cheese. Others could also be used. For a different effect, you 
  could apply the Cheese as part of the Garnish, along with Olives and 
  Cashews.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Olives, Black:</h3> &nbsp; These should be some form of Mediterranean 
  Black Olives, not California Black Salad Olives, which have a much different 
  flavor. The ones used in the photo example were Salt Cured Moroccan.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cashews:</h3> &nbsp; Dry pan roasted raw Cashews have an entirely 
  different flavor and texture from commercially roasted Cashews.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If there will be long sitting time after 
  dressing, you may want to salt the Cucumbers after cutting, let them 
  sit for at least 30 minutes, then rinse and drain well before mixing 
  with other ingredients.</li>
