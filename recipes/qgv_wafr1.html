This fine salad is very popular in Ghana and Nigeria, countries not 
otherwise noted for salads. Nobody knows how this odd mixture came about, 
but it is adhered to pretty closely.

  <p>To make this salad vegetarian, just use vegetarian baked beans. It can 
  be made with Pasta rather than Potatoes. See also 
  <a href="qgv_wafr1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a></p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 15 min work + cooling time)
  <ol>
  <li>Hard Boil <b>EGGS</b> and shell them. For the best method see 
    our recipe <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>.
    Chill the Eggs well.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Boil until 
    just cooked through (or cook <b>PASTA</b> if using instead). Drain 
    and let cool.</li>
  </ol> 
  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + sitting time)
  <ol>
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> and <b>CUCUMBERS</b> 1/4 to 3/8 inch. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and grate medium.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CABBAGE</b> and <b>LETTUCE</b> fairly small. Mix with 
    Carrots.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>CORN</b>. </li>
  <li>Drain any liquid from <b>Tomato mix</b>. Place all 
    <b>Salad items</b> (<u>except</u> <b>Eggs</b>) in a large mixing 
    bowl and tumble gently.</li>
  <li>If you have time, place the salad in the fridge for about an 
    hour to cool and blend flavors.</li>
  <li>When getting ready to serve, mix <b>Dressing</b>.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Salad</b> in a serving bowl.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Eggs</b> and arrange them around the salad.</li>
  <li>Open can of <b>Baked Beans</b> and spoon some on top center of 
    the salad.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve spoon some <b>Dressing</b> onto the salad 
    and/or provide it on the side. For buffet service, I'd mix just 
    enough dressing into the salad before placing in the serving 
    bowl and provide both additional Dressing and additional Baked 
    Beans on the side.</li> 
  <li>Serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, but Red Potatoes and even 
  Yukon Gold can be used in this recipe (if you don't over-cook them).  
  Note also that Pasta can be used instead of Potatoes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use 
  small cucumbers that don't need to be peeled or seeded, such as 
  Persian, Japanese or European. If you have only the standard waxed 
  green blimps, peel them and seed them, then measure out the given 
  weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Baked Beans:</h3> &nbsp; In Africa they use 
  mostly Heinz, but I use either Bush's Regular or Bush's Vegetarian 
  Baked Beans, depending on who I'm serving. The vegetarian may not be 
  easy to find, I buy it from Smart &amp; Final.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dressing:</h3> &nbsp; This mix sort of resembles 
  the bottled Salad Cream traditional in West Africa. It has been 
  reported that people there are tending toward using plain Mayonnaise, 
  but I appreciate the added tartness from the vinegar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This salad is widely served 
  by street vendors and restaurants in West Africa - but, don't eat it 
  there! A 2016 study in Ghana found 98% of salads served by street 
  vendors contained unacceptable levels of fecal bacteria. Of that served 
  in restaurants, 60% contained unacceptable levels. I doubt Nigeria 
  is significantly better.</li>
