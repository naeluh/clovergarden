  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>IF <b>Green Cardamom</b>, remove the seeds from the shells. Mix 
    <b>Cardamom seeds</b> with <b>Nigella</b> and <b>Coriander</b> 
    seeds.</li>
  <li>Melt the <b>BUTTER</b> slowly in a heavy bottomed pan. Do not disturb 
    it as it melts.</li>
  <li>Carefully skim foam off the top as it rises until it is all removed. 
    Let the water in the butter bubble out, paying close attention to 
    temperature. When temperature starts to rise above 212&deg;F/100&deg;C, 
    watch it carefully. When to around 240&deg;F/115&deg;C, take it off the 
    heat.</li>
  <li>Give the <b>Butter</b> a final skim and pour it off the solids in the 
    bottom. You can pour it through a very fine strainer if you need to 
    (see <a href="qid_niter1x.html#gal6"><b>Gallery</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Clean and dry the saucepan. Return the melted Butter to the pan and 
    bring it back to a temperature of about 220&deg;F/104&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cardamom mix</b> and hold at temperature below 
    240&deg;F/115&deg;C for 15 minutes, stirring gently now and then.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Koseret</b> and <b>Besobela</b>. Stir now and then for about 
    another 7 minutes, taking care the temperature doesn't rise above 
    240&deg;F or so.</li>
  <li>Let sit for about 10 minutes to settle, then strain through a very fine 
    strainer (see <a href="qid_niter1x.html#gal6"><b>Gallery</b></a>), or 
    a double layer of cheesecloth.</li>
  <li>Seal tightly in a dry jar. Like Clarified Butter, Niter Kibbeh will 
    have some residual water, so needs to be kept in a tightly sealed jar 
    and used within a week or so, or refrigerated in a sealed jar, where it 
    will last for a few months. When spooning out, make sure you use a clean 
    dry spoon, any moisture can cause spoilage.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; <b>Korarima</b> (<i>Aframomum corrorima</i>) 
  would be used in Ethiopia, but if you don't have it, regular Green Cardamom 
  is closer to it than other African <i>Aframomum</i> species. You will need 
  about 15 pods. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_korarz.html">
  <b>Korarima</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Koseret:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is native to Ethiopia, but is now used 
  all over tropical Africa. Subst: half and half Oregano and Thyme (inexact). 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/vb_koseretz.html"><b>Koseret</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Besobela:</h3> &nbsp; This mint is used dried, usually just the flower 
  heads, but sometimes leaves as well. The best substitute is dried Thai 
  Purple Mint, but it is not exact. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mt_besobz.html"><b>Besobela</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Every household has its own version. Some 
  include onion, garlic, ginger root, and pepper, considering the spices given 
  here as optional. Fenugreek or cinnamon may be some of the spices, and some 
  include turmeric. The ingredients for this recipe are based on one by 
  Yohanis Gebreyesus.</li>
