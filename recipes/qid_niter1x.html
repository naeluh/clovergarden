<p><span class=tf>Step by step pictorial for making this essential 
ingredient for Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisines. &nbsp; Return to 
<a href="qid_niter1.html"><b>Main Page</b></a></span>.<br></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee11d.jpg" alt="Stove Burner" class=mrg>
Select a burner on your stove that can be very precisely controlled near 
the bottom of its heat range, and preferably one with a heat spreader, 
as in the photo, or use some other heat spreader on the burner.
<br class=cll>

<p><img src="img/qid_niter01d.jpg" alt="Melting Butter" class=mrg>
Purchase 1 pound of a top grade <u>unsalted</u> butter and melt it 
slowly in a heavy bottomed pan. The pan in the photo is a 1-1/2 quart 
tri-ply sauce pan. It would be large enough for 2 pounds of butter. Do 
not disturb the butter as it melts.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee16d.jpg" alt="Melted Butter" class=mrg>
Once the Butter has completely melted without being disturbed, there will 
be a layer of foam on the top, and some milk solids will have fallen to 
the bottom. This foam must be carefully skimmed off.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/gid_ghee19d.jpg" alt="Partially Skimmed Butter" class=mrg>
Here the foam has been partially skimmed off, exposing the melted butter. 
Skim it all off and simmer the butter, skimming any additional foam. 
You will see bubbling as the water in the butter slowly boils off. Barely 
visible in the center of the pan are some bubbles. Let this boiling 
proceed slowly.</p>
<p>Eventually the bubbling will slow and be a lot more erratic, with small 
bursts of bubbles rising to the surface. The temperature will start to rise 
above 212&deg;F/100&deg;C. When it gets quite erratic and up to around 
240&deg;F/115&deg;C, you can call it <b>Clarified Butter</b>, give it 
a final skim and decant it off the solids in the bottom.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/qid_niter03d.jpg" alt="Steeping the Herbs &amp; Spices" class=mrg>
Clean and dry the saucepan. Return the melted Butter to the pan and bring it 
back to a temperature of about 220&deg;F/104&deg;C. Stir in <b>Cardamom mix</b> 
and hold at temperature below 240&deg;F/115&deg;C for 15 minutes, stirring 
gently now and then.</p>
<p>Stir in <b>Koseret</b> and <b>Besobela</b>. Stir now and then for about 
another 7 minutes, taking care the temperature doesn't rise above 240&deg;F 
or so.
<br class=cll></p>

<p id="gal6"><img src="img/qid_niter06d.jpg" alt="Final Straining of Niter" class=mrg>
Now do a final straining, passing the Ghee through an extremely fine mesh 
strainer (these can be found in East / Southeast Asian markets), or a double 
layer of Cheesecloth. Discard all the solids.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/qid_niter09d.jpg" alt="Finished Niter Kibbeh" class=mrg>
Here we have the finished and Niter Kibbeh, still in it's melted state. 
In a tightly sealed jar, it will last for a week or so at room temperature. 
It will be liquid, slurry or solid depending on room temperature. The photo 
at the top of the page is from this batch cooled to the semi-solid slurry 
state. Refrigerated it will last for months.</p>
<p><span class=lg><b>Caution:</b> </span> &nbsp; When spooning Niter Kibbeh 
out of the jar, it is important that the tools you use be totally dry. Any 
moisture introduced could result in spoilage. The jar you store it in 
must also have been totally dry before pouring the Niter Kibbeh into it.
