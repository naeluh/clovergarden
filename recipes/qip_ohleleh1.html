A standard ingredient in much of sub-Saharan Africa. It's used for a dish 
called Oleleh in Sierra Leone and Moi Moi in Nigeria, as well as in 
many sauces for chicken, fish and meat.

Black Eyed peas are the beans to use because they are native to Africa - 
all other familiar beans came from the Americas. 1 cup dry beans will 
yield 2 cups of finished paste. If you need less (or more) just use 
half the volume of dried beans for the amount you want.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>Black Eyed Peas</b> in plenty of water until they are 
    wrinkly, 8 to 10 minutes. (see <a href="qip_ohleleh1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Next, the beans must be broken to release the skins. They are 
    usually too tough to do this even with strong hands. I pound them 
    in a big clay Thai/Laotian mortar with wooden pestel (about 10 
    minutes). In Africa, the mortar would be made from a piece of tree 
    trunk. Some recent recipes say to put them in a food processor 
    and pulse just 4 times.</li>
  <li>Fill a large shallow bowl with lots of cold water. Stir it up and 
    give the beans just enough time to sink, then pour off the water, 
    which should carry away much of the skins. Repeat until all beans 
    are skin free (the black "eyes" will all be gone). With a sharp eye 
    and pouring through your fingers you should be able to stop any 
    white beans parts from escaping.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>Black Eyed Peas</b> an aditional 8 or more hours in plenty 
    of water. Some recipes call for them to be soaked overnight in 
    a warm room temperature so they become slightly fermented (there 
    will be foam in the jar)</li>
  <li>Drain the beans and pound to a paste in a mortar (or by some other 
     means). If you use a processor you will probably have to add about 
     3 Tablespoons of water, but that generally won't be a problem. To 
     get a really smooth paste I sometimes process, then pound in a 
     mortar.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peeling Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes say to 
  soak the beans overnight before peeling. I have had better luck 
  peeling them as above, when the beans are harder and denser so they 
  don't break up so much and sink better. This makes panning easier. 
  After panning off the skins, I often pound again to get the beans 
  that didn't split.</li>
