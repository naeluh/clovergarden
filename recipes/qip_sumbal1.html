This is a standard ingredient used in much of sub-Saharan Africa. 
It is traditionally made from N&eacute;r&eacute;, seeds from the pods 
of the African Locust tree (<i>Parkia biglobosa</i>). 
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Unfortunately, N&eacute;r&eacute; seeds are becoming difficult to obtain 
even in West Africa, so in some regions the local women have started 
using Soybeans instead. The fermented beans are formed into balls or 
patties and dried. The photo shows Sumbala Balls on a bed of the 
N&eacute;r&eacute; seeds from which they were made.

The photo to the left is of Fermented Locust Bean Seeds (Iru) purchased 
on-line in North America for 2018 US $3.69 / ounce. Product of Nigeria, 
they should be suitable as a starter for fermenting soybeans.

<h2>Shan Tua Nao Disks</h2>

<img src="img/sip_tuanao21e.jpg" alt="Shan Tua Nao Disks" class=mrg></a>

Since West Africans are now using Soybeans instead of the difficult 
to obtain African Locust Beans, the process is exactly the same as in 
our recipe for Burmese Shan <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sip_tuanao1.html">
<b>Tua Nao Disks</b></a>. While Locust Beans are still preferred where 
available, Soybeans are much easier to process, as they don't have hard 
shells that need to be removed.

<p>The Shan Disk shape is very efficient as it dries well and can be 
stored for many months, but you could form the paste into balls or 
patties if you wish.</p>

<p>If you wish, you could order some imported Sumbala and use some 
powder to initiate your fermentation.</p>

<p>I use a powerful food processor to grind the beans into paste. If 
you are using more primitive methods, or want the rustic appearance 
of nearly whole crushed beans in balls or patties, you will want to 
skin the beans before fermenting.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Skinning Soybeans</h2>

<ol>
<li>Place the <b>Beans</b> in a saucepan covered well with <b>Water</b>. 
  Bring to a boil for just a few minutes until the beans look wrinkly.
  </li>
<li>Drain the beans and pour them into a large mortar. In Africa this 
  would be a hollowed out tree trunk, but I use a Thai/Laotian clay 
  mortar. Pound well, stirring up often and hard enough to split a lot 
  of beans but not so hard as to break them up.</li>
<li>put in a deep pan covered with plenty of warm water. Massage the 
  beans and pour off floating skins.</li>
<li>Return skinned beans to a sauce pan to continue cooking, about 
  another 3-1/2 hours.</li>
  </ol>
