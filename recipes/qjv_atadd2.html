Ata DinDin is Yoruba, meaning "Fried Pepper". Recipes vary <u>in the 
extreme</u> (see <a href="qjv_atadd2.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>). For a different example

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>Red Peppers</b> fairly small. Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>Red Chilis</b> fine if fresh, or run in the spice grinder if 
    dried. Add to Red Peppers.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>HABANERO</b> and slice. Add to Red Peppers</li>
  <li>Run <b>Red Pepper mix</b> in a Processor or Mixie until chopped to your 
    desired texture. I run it to a bit short of being smooth.</li>
  <li>In a heavy bottomed saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Red Palm Oil</b> 
    and <b>Plain Oil</b>, but only to about 300&deg;F/150&deg;C to avoid 
    bleaching the Palm Oil. Carefully Stir in <b>Red Pepper mix</b> and bring 
    up to a boil. Stir in <b>Smoke Dried Fish</b>, <b>Maggi Cubes</b>, and 
    <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Turn down to a very moderate simmer and simmer, stirring often, 
    until the oil begins to separate. This should be about 50 minutes to 
    an hour and 10 minutes. The Oil is starting to separate when, if you 
    scrape a path with the flat of your spatula, you see oil at the leading 
    edge of the sauce as it closes the path. Don't fry it too dry or the 
    fresh flavor will be lost.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat. Move it all into a tightly coverable jar. Let it 
    sit until cool. If not enough oil rises to cover the top of the sauce, 
    add a bit more. With the oil covering it, it should keep in the fridge 
    for several weeks.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; In Nigeria it would be proper to use Tatashe 
  peppers, but even there they are often confused with Red Bell Peppers, 
  even in the markets. Our Red Anaheims would be closer to Tatashe, so use 
  whichever you can get. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This is where you control how hot your sauce 
  will be, by what chilis and how many. In Nigeria, Ata Wewe (very tiny, 
  very hot bird peppers) are often specified. These are currently unavailable 
  outside Nigeria, so Nigerian expats specify Red Thai Chilis. Here in North 
  America, de Arbols would also work well. Five Red Thai Chilis made this 
  sauce fairly spicy by Southern California standards - but use your own best 
  judgement. It is generally expected these chilis will be fresh, but grind 
  up dry ones in your spice grinder and they will work fine. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This fresh chili is not 
  optional, no matter how many Red Chilis you decide to use. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This palm oil is much used in West Africa 
  and Bahia Brazil, and is needed to accurately replicate dishes from 
  those regions. For details and substitute, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Pure Olive Oil or Pomace Olive oil are fine, but not 
  Virgin.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Smoke Dried Fish:</h3> &nbsp; A very important flavoring ingredient 
  through West Africa, available on-line in North America. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshdsmkz.html"><b>Smoke Dried Fish</b></a> 
  page. Any of those fish should be fine.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Maggi Cubes:</h3> &nbsp; This is a Bouillon Cube almost universally 
  used in West Africa, but hard to get in North America. For details and  
  substitutes see our <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi&reg; 
  Cubes</b></a> page. Use what Bouillon Cubes are available to you - or to 
  be more "authentic" than most Nigerians are, <a href="qip_sumbal1.html">
  <b>Sumbala / Dawadawa</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is my formulation, taking hints 
  from a number of recipes by real Nigerians - and it is <u>delicious</u>. 
  Some recipes use all Red Palm Oil, and some use none, and the amount of 
  oil used varies <u>a lot</u>. What hot chilis are used and how many ranges 
  to extremes (up to 40 hot red Thai chilis or Ata Wewe - even I'm not going 
  to try that). Some recipes use ground "Crayfish" (actually dry smoked shrimp) 
  instead of Dry Smoked Fish, some use both, and some use neither. Some are 
  based on Tomatoes rather than Red Peppers. Texture ranges from very smooth 
  to coarse salsa.</li>
