<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is most variable ingredient in recipes 
  for Monkeygland Sauce. Some use Ketchup (called "Tomato Sauce" in South 
  Africa), Some use Canned Tomatoes combined with Ketchup or Tomato Sauce, 
  but don't define whether that means Ketchup or our Tomato Sauce. I chose 
  to use a fresh tasting simple tomato sauce to keep sweetness within limits. 
  My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple sauces will also work, 
  even Goya Spanish Style, if you aren't still boycotting them for endorsing 
  Trump on TV.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chutney:</h3> &nbsp; Though our recipe for <a href="qjv_fchut1.html">
  <b>Dried Fruit Chutney</b></a> is quite superior, it wants 2 weeks of 
  maturing, so, you can use "Mrs H.S. Ball's Original Chutney", easily found 
  on-line, or make ours and use it prematurely. Nobody is likely to notice.
  You could even use Apricot Jam and bump the Wine Vinegar to 2-1/2 
  Tablespoons.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>The Name:</h3> &nbsp; Google insists its "Monkey Gland Sauce", but my 
  authentic South African cookbooks say "Monkeygland Sauce", which is much 
  easier to say. The origin of the name is uncertain, but most stories 
  involve an outraged French Chef, distressed by the locals slathering things 
  like ketchup, chutney, and Worcestershire sauce over his masterpieces. In 
  anger, he composed a recipe including all of those offending substances. 
  There was also a huge amount of tabloid talk at the time about a certain 
  Dr. Serge Voronoff, who was splicing monkey testicle tissue onto the 
  testicles of men, claiming it would keep them young - so "Monkeygland 
  Sauce" - similarly to how <a href="bmm_toadhole1.html"><b>Toad in the 
  Hole</b></a> was named for tabloid features of its day in England. 
  The sauce soon became wildly popular in South Africa.</li>
