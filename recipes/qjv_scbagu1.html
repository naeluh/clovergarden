This interesting sauce is served particularly with fish, but useful 
also for pork. The Okra provides body and adherence. This sauce is easy 
to make and well worth trying.

  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, steam <b>Spinach</b> with <b>Fish Sauce</b>,

    sufficient. Steam, stirring until just wilted and a uniform cooked

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  Sorrel, if available, with Spinach as a second choice. If Sorrel is 
  used, skip the Lemon Juice. Our Sorrel is a cool climate plant, and 
  what is called "Sorrel" in West Africa is actually Roselle leaves, 
  which also would not need the Lemon Juice.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Thai/Vietnamese Fish 
  Sauce was introduced to Senegal by refugees from the French Indochina 
  war in the early 1950s. It is now often used, as it is here, in place 
  of a piece of Guedj, a dried fermented white fish. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
