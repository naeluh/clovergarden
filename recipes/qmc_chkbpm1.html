This delicious main dish seems at first glance rather Chinese, but important 
features are African. Stir fries are very popular in Tanzania today. See also

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40+ min - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into strips, 1/4 inch thick, around 3/4 inch wide, 
    and up 2-1/2 inches long, or however works with your Chicken.</li>
  <li>Crush 3 cl <b>GARLIC</b> to paste. Massage all <b>Marinade items</b> 
    into the <b>Chicken</b>. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off skins under running water (see 
    <a href="qmc_chkbpm1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Cap and core <b>Bell Peppers</b> and cut into strips about 1/2 inch 
    wide up to 2-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Crush 3 cl <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    then cut slices into threads. Mix</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CABBAGE</b>. Measure is after shredding. Peel <b>Carrot</b>
    and cut into juliennes about 2-1/2 inches long. I use a julienning 
    vegetable peeler. Mix.</li> 
  <li>Slice white part of <b>SCALLION</b> fairly thin diagonally. Cut the 
    green part crosswise 1/8 inch wide. Mix White part with Cabbage and keep 
    Green part separate.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>MANGO</b> and cut lengthwise into strips about 1/4 inch wide.
    </li>
  <li>Dry pan toast <b>RAW CASHEWS</b> tumbling well. They will have brown 
    spots, and be very different in flavor and texture than commercially 
    roasted Cashews.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;   (20 min)
    <ol start="4"> 
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Chicken </b>, tossing over high heat until it has completely lost its 
    raw color, all exuded liquid has evaporated, and it's cooked through, 
    about 5 minutes. Remove Chicken and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Reheat over high flame and stir in 
    <b>Garlic mix</b> for a few seconds but no browning. Stir in 
    <b>Bell Peppers</b> and <b>Cabbage mix</b>. Fry stirring for a few 
    seconds. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Pepper</b>, and <b>Salt</b>. Fry stirring 
    over fairly high heat for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Chili Flake</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Chicken is well warmed. Don't overcook, Bell Peppers should still be 
    fairly crisp.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cashews</b> and <b>Scallion Greens</b>.
    Accompany with Rice (Egyptian or Jasmine).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. I always use 
  Thigh / Leg Meat, which doesn't slice as nicely as breast, but is much 
  closer to African chicken than the cardboard breast meat we get here in 
  North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Definitely a Chinese influence, but you 
  can substitute Honey if you don't have Oyster Sauce. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably a mix of Green, Red and Yellow.
  The pattern recipe did not call for them to be skinned, but this gives 
  a more pleasant texture, especially if any of the dish will be reheated. 
  With the <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> it takes 
  just a few minutes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you control the heat. For me, 
  1 teaspoon of Indian Khandella or Reshampatti is just right, but if you 
  are chili adverse, Korean Flake will be much less hot, or even Aleppo. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; 
  Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Tanzanian cuisine reflects influences from 
  coastal regions of Asia, but interpreted in an African way. This delicious 
  stir fry includes a lot more Chicken vs. Vegetables than would be the case 
  in Asia, and Carrots, Mango, and Cashews are also very African ingredients. 
  Tanzania is the largest exporter of Cashews in Africa. The pattern recipe 
  was by a 4th generation Indian Tanzanian.</li>
