This stew would be for special occasions in Africa, as chicken is 
expensive there, and always a hassle since you have to start with a 
live chicken. It's just chicken and sauce, but the sauce is surprisingly 
substantial. See also <a href="qmc_chkcoc1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a> below.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min + marinade time=3+ hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1-1/2 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin. Cut slices into threads 
    and chop very fine. Crush <b>GINGER</b> and chop very fine. Chop 
    <b>SERRANO</b> very fine. Chop <b>ROSEMARY</b> very fine. Mix all.
    </li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. 
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Chicken</b> well. 
    Set aside for 2 to 3 hours, or overnight in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop coarse. Mix with <b>Tomato Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse for Garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Drain <b>Chicken</b> well <u>reserving marinade</u> - see 
    <a href="qmc_chkcoc1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Chicken</b>, tumbling until lightly browned. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Onions</b> into the pan and fry stirring until lightly 
    browned. Take care the fond sticking to the pan doesn't get too 
    dark.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and fry stirring for 1 minute.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer covered, 
    stirring now and then until tomatoes are soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Coconut Milk</b>, reserved 
    <b>Marinade</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered 
    until Chicken is tender, about 30 minutes for boneless chunks.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning, adjust liquid if needed. It should have plenty 
    of liquid if served with rice, especially since this sauce tends to 
    thicken when taken off the stove.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of Steamed Basmati or Jasmine Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and 
  boneless. Use only Thigh and Leg Meat, never the cardboard flavored 
  breast meat we get around here. You could also use 1-3/4 pounds 
  skinless bone-in Chicken pieces cut to serving lengths. A razor 
  sharp Chinese cleaver driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect for 
  this.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using 
  tomato paste called for in recipes, I like to add a convenient 8oz 
  can of a very simple tomato sauce, which helps make up for deficient 
  tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple 
  sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>East African Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; You can 
  easily make a very tasty Curry Powder by our recipe  
  <a href="qys_curryea1.html"><b>East African Curry Powder</b></a>. 
  You could also use a Madras style powder (Ship or Sun brand), but 
  I recommend the above mix in this recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The drain and fry steps can 
  be done up to a day ahead, refrigerating both chicken and drained 
  marinade. Alternatively to frying, you could grill or broil the 
  Chicken, then use just 1 T Oil for the Onions. The saut&eacute; pan 
  method is suitable for no more than a single recipe. If I were making 
  more for a party I'd deep fry the Chicken in a kadhai or wok - in fact, 
  I'd consider doing that even for a single recipe (faster, easier to 
  control, less splattering).
