An important factor in this delicious dish is very slow cooking in a 
sealed container, shaking it now and then so the ingredients don't stick. 
It is traditionally cooked in a clay pot set in embers from 
the kitchen fire.

Most North American kitchens lack hot ashes except after a serious fire, 
so we have provided several cooking methods you can chose from that 
don't require ashes. The stovetop method is the trickiest.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite-sized pieces if boneless. or as 
    noted in <a href="qmc_chkkedj1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water (a little more if 
    plum tomatoes), quench in cold water, skin and cut into 3/4 inch 
    pieces.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Map Gas or Propane Torch</b></a> 
    and brush the skins off under running water. Cut into about 1 inch 
    squares.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice medium crosswise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1 inch lengths crosswise.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise if thin, and crosswise about 
    1 inch, or, if other shape to similar sizes. Large Globe eggplants 
    need to be skinned. If you need to hold the pieces, keep them in 
    cold water until needed.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and chop fine. Crush 
  <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO</b> open.</li>
  <li>Mix all ingredients well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (as given below)
  <ul>
  <li><b>Oven Method</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
    <ol start="10">
    <li>Preheat oven to 325&deg;F</li>
    <li>Place <b>Ingredient mix</b> in a heavy Dutch Oven with a tight 
      fitting lid (if not really tight place a Banana leaf or sheet of 
      Aluminum Foil over the top before placing the lid over).</li>
    <li>Place in the oven. Shake it every 10 minutes or so to prevent 
      sticking, and let cook for about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol></li>
  <li><b>Slow Cooker Method</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
    <ol start="10">
    <li>I'm a control freak and don't have patience for slow cookers, 
      so this is my method.</li>
    <li>Place <b>Ingredient mix</b> in a heavy bottomed pot and bring 
      up almost to a boil (some bubbling).</li>
    <li>Pour into the slow cooker and turn to "High".  As soon as you 
      see some bubbling, turn to "Low". Let cook until your chicken 
      is done. Shaking is not needed.</li>
    </ol></li>
  <li><b>Stove Top Method</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hrs)
    <ol start="10">
    <li>Place <b>Ingredient mix</b> in a heavy bottomed pot with a tight 
      fitting lid (see Oven method). Bring up almost to a boil (some 
      bubbling).</li>
    <li>Turn down to a bare simmer, just a few bubbles now and then. Let 
      cook until your chicken is done. Shake it every 5 minutes or so 
      to prevent sticking.</li>
    </ol></li>    
  </ul>
  <ol start="13">
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Thigh and Leg 
  meat without bones, fat or skin. In Africa 4 or 5 pounds of whole 
  chicken would cut into pieces, with excess fat removed. I prefer the 
  cut chicken meat for buffet service, and to prevent fights at the 
  table.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very ripe 
  and flavorful. If your tomatoes don't measure up, use a 28 oz can of 
  whole tomatoes, chopped coarse and include juice. Another trick I use 
  when the tomatoes aren't quite tasty enough or red enough is to add 
  an 8 ounce can of a simple Tomato Sauce. My favorite is Faraon 
  brand Spanish Style.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; This can be Red, Green, 
  or a combination of the two".</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Select a long thin type of 
  eggplant or another variety that doesn't need to be skinned, such as 
  purple Indian eggplants.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is used only if skinless Chicken is 
  used. Omit for skin-on Chicken.</li>
