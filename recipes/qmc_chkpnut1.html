Recipes combining Tomatoes and Peanut Butter are popular in West Africa, 
and this is one of the most famous in that form. The only difference 
between the Soup and the Stew is the amount of broth.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite-sized pieces if boneless - or as 
    noted in <a href="qmc_chkpnut1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water (a little more if 
    plum tomatoes), quench in cold water, skin and chop small.</li>
  <li>Cap and tail <b>OKRA</b> and cut into 1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    <u>Set aside</u> half the Onions.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise. Cut slices into narrow 
    threads and chop fine.
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO</b> open lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Vegies items</b> - <u>except</u> the reserved 
    half of the <b>Onions</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Place <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Vegies mix</b> and 1/3 c <b>Water</b> in 
    a heavy bottomed 4 quart pot with a tight fitting lid. Bring up 
    to a boil and turn down to a simmer. Steam for 10 minutes, stirring 
    a couple times.</li>
  <li>Stir in the other 1/2 of the <b>Onions</b>, the <b>Tomato Sauce</b> 
    and 4 cups <b>Broth</b> (3 cups for stew). Bring to a boil, 
    reduce to a simmer and cover.</li>
  <li>Ladle 1 cups of the hot <b>Broth</b> into a medium saucepan. 
    Stir in the <b>Peanut Butter</b> until smooth. Cook over medium heat, 
    stirring every few seconds, until oil starts to separate (about 15 
    minutes).</li> 
  <li>When oil starts to separate (the peanut butter looks glossy), 
    ladle in another cup of <b>Broth</b> and stir until smooth. 
    Carefully stir this mix into the Soup Pot until it is all evenly 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Okra</b> and continue to simmer until Chicken is 
    done, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>When done, there should be a small amount of red oil on the surface. 
    If there is too much, skim off the excess.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with "Mash" or plenty of steamed Jasmine rice 
    (see <a href="qmc_chkpnut1.html#8"><b>Note-8</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Thigh and Leg 
  meat without bones, fat or skin. In Africa 3 to 4 pounds of chicken 
  parts, bone-in, skinless and fat removed would be used. I prefer the 
  cut chicken meat for buffet service, and to prevent fights at the 
  table.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select the smallest, youngest 
  pods you can find.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / 
  Scotch Bonnet Chilis from the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. 
  Just one gives this recipe definite sharpness. If you're from the 
  Frozen North, you may want to use half of one, but others may feel 
  free to use two. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a very 
 simple Tomato Sauce. My favorite is Faraon brand Spanish Style, which 
 comes in convenient 8 ounce cans.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; When preparing for a dish of 
  this type, I buy chicken a day ahead as whole thighs or whole leg 
  quarters. I remove skin, bones and fat, putting it all in a pot and 
  simmering for 3 to 4 hours, then strain out and discard the solids. 
  Remove the fat using a gravy separator. This becomes the broth 
  for the recipe. It is strong enough to be extended a bit with water 
  if need be. For more on making and storing Broth, see our page 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Peanut Butter:</h3> &nbsp; This <u>must</u> be 
  natural, unsweetened and smooth. Shop this in advance, many markets 
  stock only the heavily sugared kind kids prefer - essentially, 
  peanut flavored candy. I use Laura Scudder's All Natural.</li>
<li id="7">
  <h3>African Mash:</h3> &nbsp; These are the "rice" 
  of Africa, the bland starchy main dishes to which the strongly 
  flavored soups and stews are the sauce. Examples are 
  <a href="qsv_banku1.html"><b>Banku</b></a> and 
  <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Fufu</b></a>. Since these tend to be 
  inconvenient in a Western household, I usually use steamed Jasmine 
  Rice, which is also used in Africa if it can be afforded.</li>
<li id="8">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; If this is made as a stew, 
  I serve it on the same plate as rice. If it is served as a soup, I 
  provide a bowl of rice diners can spoon into their soup bowl as 
  desired. If serving a "mash", it is usually in the form of a ball, 
  provided on the plate or included in the bowl of soup.</li>
