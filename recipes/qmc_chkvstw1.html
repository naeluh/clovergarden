This stew, showing strong influence from India, is a little more 
elaborate than many. In East Africa, chicken is reserved for special 
occasions. See also <a href="qmc_chkvstw1.html#08"><b>Comments</b></a>

In East Africa, chicken is expensive and a hassle. It has to be purchased 
live, and becomes a "do it yourself" project on serving day.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min + marinade time = 2 hrs +)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Chicken</b> with <b>Black Pepper</b> and set aside for 
    2 to 3 hours in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small. Mix with <b>Tomato Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in 
    cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 3/8 inch thick drums.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GREENS</b> into strips about 3/8 inch wide and 1-1/4 inch 
    long. Measure is moderately packed.</li>
  <li>Trim caps of <b>OKRAS</b> into cones, being careful not to cut 
    into the hollow part. Tumble with <b>Vinegar</b> and set aside for 
    at least 20 minutes. Tumble now and then to keep them wet.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO</b> open.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    crosswise, cut slices into threads and chop threads fine. Grind 
    <b>CUMIN SEEDS</b>. Mix all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hrs)
  <ol start="13">
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> well.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Potatoes</b>, tumbling until lightly browned. 
    Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Chicken</b> to the pan and fry tumbling until lightly 
    browned. Take care the fond sticking to the pan doesn't get too 
    dark. Sprinkle <b>Lime Juice</b> over, stir, remove from the pan 
    and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add a little oil if needed. Stir <b>Onions</b> into the pan and 
    fry stirring until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spice mix</b> and fry stirring for 1 minute.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer covered, 
    stirring now and then until tomatoes are soft.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in along with <b>Carrots</b>, 
    <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Coconut Cream</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer covered until Chicken is nearly tender, about 20 
    minutes for boneless chunks.</li>
  <li>Drain and rinse Okra well. Drain <b>Eggplant</b> and stir in 
    along with <b>Okra</b>, <b>Greens</b>, 1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Habanero</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for about 10 
    minutes. Stir occasionally and adjust liquid as needed - don't 
    let it get too dry. Pull the Habanero if the stew is getting too 
    sharp for you.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot with plenty of Steamed Basmati or 
    Jasmine Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and 
  boneless. Use only Thigh and Leg Meat, never the cardboard flavored 
  breast meat we get around here. You could also use 1-3/4 pounds 
  skinless bone-in Chicken pieces cut to serving lengths. A razor 
  sharp Chinese cleaver driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect for 
  this.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using 
  tomato paste called for in recipes, I like to add a convenient 8oz 
  can of a very simple tomato sauce, which helps make up for deficient 
  tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple 
  sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Select a long thin type of 
  eggplant such as Chinese, or another variety that doesn't need to be 
  skinned, such as purple Indian eggplants. If all you have are Globe 
  Eggplants, you will have to skin them. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Swiss Chard is excellent for 
  recipes of this type, but Amaranth, Cabbage, Green Bean or Sweet 
  Potato leaves could be used. Some cooks used dried greens.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select the smallest, youngest 
  Okras you can find in the bin. The vinegar soak helps keep them from 
  falling apart in cooking, but rinse after 40 minutes or they will 
  become quite stiff in short cooking.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; As in West Africa, the 
  Caribbean Habanero / Scotch Bonnet chilis now dominate the hot chili 
  segment. One will make this stew noticeably hot, but if you're from 
  the Frozen North you might want to use half of one. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The method above is suitable 
  for no more than a single recipe. If I were making more for a party 
  I'd deep fry the Chicken, then the Potatoes in batches in a kadhai or 
  wok. In fact, I'd consider doing that even for a single recipe. These 
  steps could be done a day ahead and refrigerated. Doing the potatoes 
  second will help clean the oil for another use - if it is a high 
  temperature oil like Olive Pomace, Avocado or Peanut oil. If I were 
  making this ahead for a party, I would hold the Okra and Greens until 
  it is reheated. Stir them in and simmer 10 minutes, then pour into a 
  slow cooker set to "keep warm" for serving.</li>
