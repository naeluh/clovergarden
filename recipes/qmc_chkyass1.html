A very popular dish from Senegal that has spread over much of West Africa. It

in steps.

  <li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN</b> as needed - see <a href="qmc_chkyass1.html#01"><b>Chicken</b></a> 
    for details.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise. Slice lengthwise again for 
    quarters, but not through the root end. Slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and mix all <b>Marinade items</b>.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Onions</b> in a non-reactive bowl. Gently 
    massage <b>Marinade</b> into Chicken and Onions. Marinate for about 
    3 hours at room temperature, or 8 to 12 hours in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Chicken</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min to 1 hr - can be done a day 
    ahead and refrigerated.)
    <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Chicken</b> (keeping all marinade) and wipe dry. Brown on both 
    sides, probably in batches. Method can be on a grill, in a broiler, on a 
    griddle, or in a pan with 2 T Oil. Except in a pan, brush with oil before 
    browning. <u>Caution:</u> Watch your temperature and time, chicken skin 
    burns easily.</li>

  <b><u>Onions</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min  - can be done a day ahead - or 
    while browning Chicken)
    <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain <b>Onions</b> (keeping all marinade). Place in a spacious 
    saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) and fry, stirring over decreasing flame and 
    with increasing stirring until Onions are lightly caramelized.</li> 
    </ol>
   <b><u>Garnish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 to 15 min)
   <ol start="7">
   <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> (if needed) and slice crosswise fairly thick.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a suitable Pot or Dutch Oven, place the <b>Chicken</b> in a single 
    layer. Spread the <b>Onions</b> over it.</li>
  <li>Split the <b>Habanero</b> open and add to the pot. Pour in the reserved 
    <b>Marinade</b> and the <b>Broth</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil, then turn to a simmer until Chicken is tender, 25 
    to 40 minutes, depending on thickness.</li>
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Olives</b>, and with plenty of steamed long 
    grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Various recipes use Thighs, Legs, Legs and Thighs, 
  and sometimes breasts, or all of the above. All are bone-in and skin-on, 
  with excess fat removed. For buffet service, I would use deboned thigh meat 
  cut into largish chunks after roasting. <u>Problems:</u> The photo example 
  was made with thighs. California thighs tend to be huge - so I cut them in 
  half crosswise with a sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced 
  mallet. The skin on our chicken thighs has no adhesion to the meat at all, 
  so you can be excused if you omit it (use it when making the broth). If 
  you want skin-on, drumsticks are what you want. I often cut the thin end 
  off and use it for making broth.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bouillon:</h3> &nbsp; (optional) &nbsp; In West Africa, 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi Cubes</b></a> go into just 
  about everything. You could also use about 2 teaspoons of 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Bouillon Powder</b></a>, 
  other Bouillon of your choice, or omit if you prefer. </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good Chicken Broth, but in Africa 
  it's more likely to be water with a couple Maggi Cubes. In the tropics and 
  without refrigeration regular broth spoils in just a few hours.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes use Lime Juice instead of Lemon 
  Juice, and some use a mix of both. Some recipes add 1/4 cup of Cider Vinegar, 
  but I think the lemon or lime juice is plenty sour. Some recipes stir the 
  Olives into the stew and garnish with Parsley.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This dish originated in Casamance, in the south 
  of Senegal, the part below Gambia. While the whole of Senegal is 95.9% 
  Muslim and 4.1% Christian, Casamance is about 16% Christian, 30% Native 
  Religion and 54% Muslim. The tribes are also different between Casamance 
  and the rest of Senegal. There is an independence movement and intermittent 
  violence. This has not prevented Chicken Yassa from spreading to all of 
  Senegal and most of West Africa.</li>
