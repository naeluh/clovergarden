A very flavorful fish dish that's not difficult to make. It is probably also 
made in Uganda, where Tilapia or Nile Perch would likely be used.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Any light colored fish that holds up well to 
  wet cooking is fine. The photo example was made with Tilapia which is an 
  authentically African Fish widely available in Tanzania and Uganda. I would 
  also consider Golden Pompano, Japanese Amberjack, or Snapper, especially 
  for buffet  service where the fish will be kept warm for a long time. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of 
  Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 2 cups of 
  chopped tomatoes, but our tomatoes tend to be flavor deficient. I replace 
  some of it with a very simple tomato sauce, which helps the flavor. My 
  favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, in convenient 8 oz cans, but other simple 
  sauces will also work, even Goya Spanish Style if you aren't still 
  boycotting them for enthusiastically promoting Trump on TV.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I use <a href="qys_cryzanz1.html">
  <b>Zanzibar Curry Powder</b></a>, but Tanzania was under British rule long 
  enough you could use Madras curry powder (Sun and Ship are good brands), 
  or our recipe <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>. 
  They have much milder chili heat than the Zanzibar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; How much and what kind depends on how hot your 
  Curry Powder is, and how tolerant you and your guests are of chili bite, 
  but the chili heat should be at least detectable. I use Zanzibar Curry Powder 
  which is quite hot, so would use a milder Chili Powder than my usual Indian 
  Khandela or Reshampatti. Use your own best judgement for what powder and 
  how much. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili 
  Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good quality unsweetened Coconut Milk 
  (the best come from Thailand). If you have to use a partial can, shake up 
  the can before opening it.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Frying / Broiling:</h3> &nbsp; Frying fish before including in a stew 
  or curry is common in both India and East Africa. The pattern recipe says 
  deep frying is traditional, but in her household broiling is preferred.  
  Do whichever is most convenient for you (the photo example was deep fried). 
  Most African households are not equipped to do broiling, but can do 
  grilling, so I'm pretty sure that's done there. </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Do Ahead</h3> &nbsp; As a dish prepared for a buffet presentation or 
  special occasion, I'd fry or broil the fish a day ahead and refrigerate it. 
  I'd also do the Sauce right up to adding the fish, and refrigerate. As 
  serving time approaches, it will take little time or effort to bring 
  the Sauce to a simmer and stir in the fish. For buffet, I'd also stir the 
  Cilantro at the last moment, then pour it all into a slow cooker set to 
  "keep warm".</li>
