An easy and outstandingly tasty treatment for light colored fish fillets. I 
have modified the stepping to be gentle enough for Tilapia, thus Tanzania / 
California. See also <a href="qmf_fshcel1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Pat <b>FISH FILLETS</b> dry.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine. Place in a mortar with <b>Salt</b> 
   and pound to paste.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b> and mix all <b>Marinade items</b>. 
  <li>Gently rub <b>Marinade</b> into the <b>Fish Fillets</b> and set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>CELERY</b> small. Measure is after chopping.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>BASIL</b> small. Set 1 T aside for Garnish and add the rest to 
    the Celery.</li>  
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;   (20 min)
    <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt is good for fitting fish 
    fillets), melt <b>Butter</b>. Stir in <b>Celery mix</b> and fry stirring 
    over very moderate heat until Celery is tender, but still has some 
    crispness - no browning.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Spread <b>Celery</b> evenly in the pan and place <b>Fish Fillets</b> 
    over it so they don't touch the pan. Spoon some <b>Celery</b> over 
    the Fish from spots not covered by fish.</li> 
   <li>Pour in 3 T <b>Water</b>. Cover tightly, and let steam for 4 to 5 
     minutes (longer for fillets thicker than Tilapia.</li>
  <li>Using a thin flat turner, hoist <b>Fish</b> onto serving dishes (see 
    <a href="qmf_fshcel1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>), spoon some of the <b>Celery mix</b> 
    over, and garnish as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern recipe prefers 
  Nile Perch, Kingklip, or Tuna. The first two are completely unavailable 
  in North America, and even in Tanzania, Kingklip must be imported from 
  Namibia or South Africa. Fresh Tuna is not much seen here except in sushi 
  bars. I used Tilapia, but other reasonably firm light colored fillets would 
  also work. Tilapia is a truly African fish, found in all the lakes and 
  rivers of East Africa. It is a fine and popular fish - but despised by 
  chefs. Everyone knows it's not expensive, so how can they jack the price 
  up? 14 ounces will likely be 3 Tilapia fillets, but may be just two of 
  other fish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Whether you use Jalape&ntilde;o or hotter 
  Serrano is up to you. Whether you clean out seeds and veins is also up 
  to you. Use your own best judgement. I use a seeded Serrano with much 
  of the veins left in.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lime Juice:</h3> &nbsp; Lemon Juice is also acceptable, but either 
  must be fresh squeezed.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Basil:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe presumes regular green Sweet 
  Basil, but my usual stores had only Purple Basil this week, so I used 
  Cilantro for Garnish.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe works best with a bed of steamed 
  Jasmine Rice on the serving dish.  Lay the fish over the rice and spoon 
  on the celery. This way the celery also seasons the rice as the fish 
  is broken up.</li>
