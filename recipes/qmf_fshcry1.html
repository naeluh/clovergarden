  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> well and chop very fine. Squeeze the 
    <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mix all <b>Marinade items.</b> Gently massage 
    into the Fish. Set aside for 20 minutes or more, or refrigerate for hour 
    or more.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, bring plenty of water to a boil. 
    Season with 1/2 T salt and 1/4 cup white vinegar. Place <b>Fish 
    Fillets</b> in the water, turn the flame to lowest, cover, and let poach 
    for about 4 minutes for Tilapia, up to 8 minutes if you are using thicker 
    fillets. Scoop out carefully with a flat turner, drain, and set aside.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine or run in a processor, depending on the texture 
    you prefer. That in the photo example has much more texture and more 
    liquid than specified in the pattern recipe.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Tomato Sauce</b> with <b>Tomatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fairly fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, heat 2 T 
    <b>Oil</b> very hot. Stir in <b>Cumin Seeds</b> and fry for about 15 
    seconds, then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until the Onions start 
    to show color, then stir in <b>Garlic</b> for a minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> for 30 seconds, then stir in 
    <b>Tomato mix</b> and 1/4 cup <b>Water</b> </li>
  <li>Cover and simmer for about 12 minutes.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Fish Fillets</b> flat in the sauce. Spoon sauce over the 
    Fish. Bring back to a simmer and simmer for about 3 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Lift out each fillet onto a plate and spoon over as much sauce as 
    you wish.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of <b>Steamed Jasmine Rice</b>, or <b>Flour 
  Chapatis</b> (East African Chapatis are made with white flour - so 5-1/2 
  inch Flour Tortillas are the same thing, and easily available).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe prefers Nile Perch, 
  Kingklip, or Tuna. The first two are completely unavailable in North 
  America, and fresh Tuna is scarce, except in sushi bars. Even in Tanzania, 
  Kingklip must be imported from Namibia or South Africa - other firm white 
  fish will work fine though. I use Tilapia which is an authentically African 
  Fish widely available in Tanzania. It is a fine fish, but despised by chefs 
  because it is common and doesn't cost enough - how can they charge a high 
  price? Two large Tilapia fillets will be about 12 ounces. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sf_tilapz.html"><b>Tilapia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using tomato paste called for in 
  recipes, I like to add a very simple tomato sauce, which helps make up for 
  deficient tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, in convenient 8 oz 
  cans, but other simple sauces will also work, even Goya Spanish Style if 
  you aren't still boycotting them for enthusiastically promoting Trump on 
  TV.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; How much and what kind depends on how hot your 
  Curry Powder is, and how tolerant your and your guests are of chili bite. 
  I use Zanzibar Curry Powder which is quite hot, so would use a milder 
  Chili Powder than my usual Indian Khandela or Reshampatti. Use your own 
  best judgement here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; I use <a href="qys_cryzanz1.html">
  <b>Zanzibar Curry Powder</b></a>, but Tanzania was under British rule long 
  enough you could use Madras curry powder (Sun and Ship are good brands), 
  or our recipe <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>. 
  They have much milder chili heat than the Zanzibar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but varies a 
  lot from region to region, and some from one household to another within 
  the regions. Here is a recipe for a typical <a href="iys_masalgm01.html">
  <b>Garam Masala</b></a> mix for the cuisines of northern India. East African 
  Garam Masalas are usually simpler, but this one will work fine.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for two 7 ounce fillets. 
  A large Tilapia fillet is about 5-1/2 ounces, but I found one fillet with 
  plenty of sauce and Jasmine rice was quite satisfying. If in doubt do 3 
  fillets. A 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan should accommodate two large and 
  one medium.</li>
