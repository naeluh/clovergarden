This stew features both complex textures and intense flavors.  My 
ingredients and steps closely follow the pattern recipe, but are 
adjusted to my different serving style (see 
<a href="qmf_fshstw1.html#09"><b>Serving</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Mix.</li>   
  <li>Peel <b>YUCA</b> and cut into 3/4 inch chunks. Peel <b>CARROTS</b> 
    and cut into 3/4 inch chunks. Peel <b>SWEET POTATO</b> and cut into 
    3/4 inch chunks. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CABBAGE</b> into wedges about 1 inch wide on the wide side. 
    </li>
  <li>Trim caps of <b>OKRAS</b> into cones, being careful not to cut 
    into the hollow part. Tumble with <b>Vinegar</b> and set aside for 
    at least 20 minutes. Tumble now and then to keep them wet. This 
    helps keep them from breaking apart in cooking.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>DRIED SHRIMP</b> into powder in your spice grinder. 
    Measure is for whole small shrimp.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Palm Oil</b>. Very lightly 
    powder fillets with <b>Rice Flour</b> and fry on both sides until 
    crisp. Keep temperature below 400&deg;F/200&deg;C to prevent 
    smoking. Note that rice flour doesn't brown much but gets crisp. 
    Set Fish aside on paper towels. Retain oil in the pan, there should 
    be about 3 Tablespoons - adjust if needed.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> serving buffet style: &nbsp; Cut Fish into large bite 
    size pieces (see <a href="qmf_fshstw1.html#09"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Onion mix</b> into the pan and fry stirring until 
    translucent. Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, powdered <b>Dried Shrimp</b> 
    and <b>Dried Clams</b>. Fry stirring over moderate heat until 
    tomatoes are very soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. <u>IF</u> using: stir in 
    <b>Guedge</b> and <b>Yete</b>. Bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>If necessary, you can transfer to a larger vessel at this point. 
    This recipe barely fits in a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Yuca mix</b>. Place <b>Cabbage</b> on top and bring to 
    a boil. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes. Note that the Yuca will 
    cook through but remain very firm.</li>
  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Okra</b>. Stir it in and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: &nbsp; stir in 1/4 c <b>Fish Sauce</b> (see 
    <a href="qmf_fshstw1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Very gently fold in <b>Fish</b>. Bring to a simmer long enough 
    to reheat it. Adjust liquid with boiling water if needed.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Lime Juice</b> over and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. This stew can be 
  reheated if a reasonably firm fish is chosen (tilapia or better).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Any light colored fish 
  that holds up to wet cooking is fine. Some can be used skin-on. For 
  the photo example I used Tilapia fillets, though for guests I'd use 
  Golden Pompano, probably skin-on. For details see our our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> (very 
  large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This palm oil is 
  much used in West Africa and Bahia Brazil, and is essential to 
  accurately replicate dishes from those regions. For details and 
  substitute see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yuca:</h3> &nbsp; A very important vegetable in West Africa, this 
  root can be found in most markets that serve a Latin American or Asian 
  community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sweet Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Either white sweet 
  potatoes or the orange ones called "Yams" in North America can be used. 
  I prefer the white which are less sweet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_mglory.html"><b>Morning Glory &amp; Yam</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably buy a small 
  cabbage so the wedges aren't too large. The pattern recipe keeps 
  the core to hold the wedges together for serving, but that doesn't 
  work well for buffet, so I cut off the core.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Use the smallest okra pods 
  you can find. The ones in the photo example are a little too large, 
  but smaller were not available at the time.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Dried Clams:</h3> &nbsp; if you can't find 
  these use small pieces of salted dried fish. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdshell.html"><b>Shellfish Products</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Flavorings:</h3> &nbsp; Guedge / Gejj is dried 
  fermented white fish. Yete / Yeet: is fermented flesh of a giant 
  Sea Snail. Both are rather pungent. If you don't have these, do as 
  many Senegalese do and use 2 T Thai / Vietnamese Fish Sauce for a 
  1 inch piece. Fish Sauce was introduced to Senegal by Vietnamese 
  refugees from the French Indochina war in the early 1950s.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern 
  recipe is a chef oriented to restaurant presentations. I usually 
  serve buffet style or very simply, thus there are procedural 
  differences between my version and his. He fries whole Snappers 
  rather than fillets and does not cut them. In the end steps he 
  removes the vegetables to serving platters before adding the whole 
  fish back into the sauce to reheat. The fish are then arranged with 
  the vegetables and sauce poured over. Whole bone-in fish doesn't 
  work for me, but his style of serving could also be done with 
  whole fillets.</li>
