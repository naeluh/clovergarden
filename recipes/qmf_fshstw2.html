This stew, from southwest Senegal, is quite simple, but also very 
flavorful.  My ingredients and steps closely follow the pattern recipe, 
but are adjusted to my different serving style (see 
<a href="qmf_fshstw2.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>FISH FILLETS</b> depending on your serving style - 
    cut into large bite size chunks for buffet, or halve them or 
    leave them whole (depending on fish size) for more formal service 
    (see <a href="qmf_fshstw2.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a>). Rub or tumble with <b>Salt</b>, 
    <b>Pepper</b> and 1 T <b>Lemon Juice</b> (see below). Let stand 
    30 minutes at room temperature or at least 1 hour in the fridge.
    </li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into about 1/2 inch dice..</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Mix 
    with Tomatoes.</li>   
  <li>Trim caps of <b>OKRA</b> into cones, being careful not to cut 
    into the hollow interior. Place in a non-reactive bowl and tumble 
    with <b>Vinegar</b>. Let sit at least 20 minutes tumbling now and 
    then to keep wet. This helps keep them from breaking apart in 
    cooking.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO CHILI</b> open.</li>
  <li>Squeeze  6 T <b>LEMON JUICE</b> (it's used in two places here, and 
    in the Baguedj Sauce (if used)).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b>. Fry 
    <b>Tomato mix</b> until Onions are tender, but no browning.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Fish</b> to the pan and enough <b>Water</b> to almost 
    cover the fish.</li>
  <li>Bring to a simmer. Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b>, 
    <b>Okra</b> and <b>Habanero</b>. Bring back to a simmer until 
    Okra is tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.  This stew can be 
  reheated if a reasonably firm fish is chosen (tilapia or better).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Any light colored fish 
  that holds up to wet cooking is fine. Some can be used skin-on. For 
  the photo example I used Tilapia fillets, though for guests I'd 
  probably use Golden Pompano, most likely skin-on. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Use the smallest, youngest 
  Okra pods you can find.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chilis 
  from the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Thai/Vietnamese Fish Sauce was introduced 
  to Senegal by refugees from the French Indochina war in the early 1950s. 
  It is now often used, as it is here, in place of a piece of Guedj, a 
  dried fermented white fish. If you are unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Baguedj Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce is 
  traditionally served with this stew and other fish dishes. It is a 
  very interesting sauce and worth trying. See our recipe 
  <a href="qjv_scbagu1.html"><b>Baguedj Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern 
  recipe is a chef oriented to restaurant presentations. I usually 
  serve buffet style or very simply, thus there are procedural 
  differences between my version and his. He uses whole Fish with 
  diagonal slashes through the skin, rather than fillets. Whole bone-in 
  fish doesn't work at all well for my guests, but his style of serving 
  could also be done with whole fillets.</li>
