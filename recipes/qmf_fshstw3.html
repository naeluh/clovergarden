This stew is quite easy to make, and absolutely delicious. Smoked fish 
is a little pricey, but the cost is certainly justified by this dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILLETS</b> into largish bite size pieces. Break up  
    <b>SMOKED FISH</b> fairly small, removing and discarding bones. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>EGGPLANT</b> medium. Hold in cold water until needed. 
  <li>Cap and tail <b>OKRA</b>. Cut crosswise into 1/2 inch segments.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    Garlic and chop fine. Mix.</li>   
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin. Cut slices into threads 
    and chop threads fine. Add to Onion mix.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO CHILI</b> open.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart is good), heat 
    <b>Red Palm Oil</b>. Fry <b>Onion mix</b> until Onions are 
    translucent.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Eggplant</b> and stir into the pan along with 
    <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Habanero</b>. Cover and stew, 
    stirring now and then, until Tomatoes are very soft (about 15 
    minutes). Check hotness and remove Habanero if it's getting too 
    hot for you.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Okra</b> and <b>Tomato Sauce</b>. Let stew for a 
    couple minutes, then stir in <b>Fish mix</b> and enough <b>Water</b> 
    to make a sauce of the consistency you want.</li>
  <li>Bring back to a simmer until Fish and Okra are tender, 5 to 10 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. This stew can be 
  reheated if a reasonably firm fish is chosen (tilapia or better).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; Any light colored fish 
  that holds up to wet cooking is fine. Some can be used skin-on. For 
  the photo example I used Tilapia fillets, though for guests I'd 
  probably use Golden Pompano. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> (very 
  large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Smoked Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Trout or Mackerel are 
  good and their bones are manageable. Herring is just too full of thread 
  bones. In Africa it would likely be smoked Bonga Shad, which is very 
  dry. If you don't have smoked fish, 2 Tablespoons of African Crayfish 
  would do (it's smoked). If all else fails, stir in a couple tablespoons 
  of Thai Fish Sauce (yes, they have that in West Africa).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Select a long thin type of 
  eggplant such as Chinese, or another variety that doesn't need to be 
  skinned, such as purple Indian eggplants. If all you have are Globe 
  Eggplants, you will have to skin them. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Use the smallest, youngest Okra pods you can 
  find.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chilis from 
  the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. One makes this dish 
  noticeably hot. Check the taste of your sauce, and remove the Chili 
  if it seems to be getting too hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This palm oil is much used in West Africa 
  and Bahia Brazil, and is needed to accurately replicate dishes from 
  those regions. For details and substitute, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; I use this instead of 
  the Tomato Paste specified in the pattern recipe because I like it 
  better. My favorite is Faraon brand Spanish Style which comes in 
  convenient 8 ounce cans, but other very simple sauces will work.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe boils the Eggplant and 
  then pur&eacute;es the Eggplant with the Tomatoes - but gives the 
  option of not pur&eacute;eing the Eggplant. I like more texture so I 
  don't pur&eacute;e the Tomatoes either. The pattern recipe mentions 
  that smoked fish is often included, but does not include it. I very 
  much favor including it.</li>
