Tibs are Ethiopian "stir fries". Ethiopians don't eat a lot of fish, but they 
have quite a few lakes and rivers, so they do eat some. This outstanding 
recipe is quick, easy, and delicious.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tilapia:</h3> &nbsp; With no access to the sea, Ethiopians eat 
  African river and lake fish, primarily Tilapia. Tilapia is a fine and 
  popular fish, but despised by fancy chefs because everyone knows it's not 
  real expensive. In Ethiopia, Nile Perch is preferred, but it's much less 
  available and more expensive. It isn't at all available in North America.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably Red or a mix of Red and Orange or 
  Yellow. The Jalape&ntilde;os will provide some green.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; While it's not an East African chili, pretty 
  much every Ethiopian recipe in English calls for Jalape&ntilde;os. This 
  chili must satisfy folks who are "from there", so that's what I use. Cored 
  and seeded, they haven't much chili heat.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Berbere Spice Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most essential spice mix in 
  Ethiopia and Eritrea. It's easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="qys_berbere2.html"><b>Berbere Spice Mix</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Niter Kibbeh:</h3> &nbsp; This is a spiced clarified butter, one of 
  the most essential elements of Ethiopian cuisines. You can make it easily 
  by our recipe <a href="qid_niter1.html"><b>Niter Kibbeh</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cardamom:</h3> &nbsp; In Ethiopia Korarima would be used, but if you 
  don't have that, the flavor of regular green cardamom is very close.</li>
