Jollof rice is perhaps the most famous West African party dish, with this 
version specific to Ghana. It is not difficult to make, but steps need to 
be in just the right order, which I have laid out in detail.

  <b><u>Chicken Phase</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min) - Easiest done 
    a day ahead and refrigerated.
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite-sized pieces if boneless - or as 
    noted in <a href="qmg_jollcg1.html#01">Note-1</a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage 
    into <b>Chicken</b>. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a kadhai or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> for deep fry and fry 
    <b>Chicken</b> in batches until lightly browned (see 
    <a href="qmg_jollcg1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Rice Phase</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water (a little more if 
    plum tomatoes), quench in cold water, skin and chop fine. Reserving 
    all juice, drain well, but don't squeeze dry.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABAERO</b> open lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Tomato Mix items</b>.</li>  
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice 
    <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin, then cut slices into threads. 
    Chop threads fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix up <b>BROTH</b> to be 4 cups. Include reserved <b>Tomato 
    Juice</b> (up to 1 cup), <b>Stock</b> and or <b>Water</b>. If 
    using Water, add 2 Maggi cubes or similar.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>RICE</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Vegetable Phase</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Slice and/or dice all chosen <b>VEGETABLES</b> (see 
    <a href="qmg_jollcg1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>) to sizes that will steam tender in 
    about the same amount of time. Carrots seem most popular, and should 
    be cut a bit thinner than other vegetables. Mix all</li>
   </ol>
  <b><u>Run Phase</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min) - (see also 
    <a href="qmg_jollcg1.html#09"><b>Method</b></a>)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed vessel large enough for the whole recipe (4 
    quart is good), heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> until 
    onions are becoming translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until heated through.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato Mix</b>. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, 
    cover and simmer until Tomatoes are very soft, stirring now and 
    then.</li>
  <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of the <b>Broth</b> and pour the remaining 3-1/2 
    cups into the pan.</li> 
  <li>Stir <b>Rice</b> into the pan. Bring back to a boil, reduce to 
    a low simmer, cover very tightly and let the rice cook 20 minutes or 
    until tender but not at all mushy. It is permissible to stir the 
    rice from the edges of the pan into the middle once if the pan is 
    wide.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile:</u> &nbsp; Steam the <b>Vegetable mix</b> until 
    just tender. Set the steamer aside to hold warm.</li>
  <li>If all liquid is absorbed and rice doesn't seem done, stir in 
    some of the reserved <b>Broth</b> (the pattern recipe needed 
    a quarter cup), stirring as little as possible.
    </li>
  <li>When done, stir in the steamed <b>Vegetable mix</b>.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot or warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Thigh and Leg 
  meat without bones, fat or skin. In Africa 3 pounds of chicken parts, 
  bone in with long bones cut in half, skinless and fat removed might 
  be used. I prefer the cut chicken meat for buffet service. Goat, 
  Mutton and Beef are also used, but need longer cooking time so 
  should be cooked separately.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; I strongly recommend deep 
  frying, because in shallower oil the Chicken splatters a lot and 
  doesn't brown at all evenly. Use a high temperature oil like Olive 
  Pomace. After use you can filter it through a paper towel and use 
  it again. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Oils for Cooking</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / 
  Scotch Bonnet Chilis from the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. 
  Just one gives this recipe definite sharpness. If you're from the 
  Frozen North, you may want to use half of one, but others may feel 
  free to use two. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; West African curry powder is highly 
  variable but usually uses more black pepper than in Anglo-India Madras 
  Curry Powder, which could be used (Ship or Sun brand). Here's a typical 
  recipe for <a href="qys_currywa1.html"><b>West African Curry 
  Powder</b></a>. Some recipes call for 1/2 teaspoon of dried Thyme 
  instead. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a very simple Tomato 
  Sauce. My favorite is Faraon brand Spanish Style, which comes in 
  convenient 8 ounce cans.</li>
<li id="06"><h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; This Broth is prepared from 
  several item, including Chicken Stock. When preparing for a dish of 
  this type, I buy chicken a day ahead as whole thighs or whole leg 
  quarters. I remove skin, bones and fat, putting them all in a pot and 
  simmering for 3 to 4 hours, then strain out and discard the solids. 
  Remove the fat using a gravy separator. This becomes the broth 
  for the recipe. It is strong enough to be extended a bit with water 
  if need be. For more on making and storing Broth, see our page 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; In Ghana, long grain rice is used, either 
  Jasmine or Basmati. Yes, these are "foreign" rices, but nearly all 
  rice consumed in West Africa is imported. In Nigeria parboiled rice 
  (like Uncle Ben's) is used, but everyone else uses long grain rice.
  </li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; Use any combination 
  from this list: Carrots, Bell Peppers, Green Beans, Long Beans, 
  Corn, Frozen Peas, Celery, etc.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; In Ghana this dish is traditionally made in a 
  clay pot and cooked in hot kitchen ashes. Here in North America most 
  of us don't have hot kitchen ashes unless there has been a serious 
  fire. I do most of my cooking on the stovetop, but some are more oven 
  oriented, which would be closer to the "ashes" 
  method. Use a heavy Dutch Oven or similar. Once the rice is in and 
  up to a boil (step 15) place tightly covered in a pre-heated 
  350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven for about 15 minutes, then check for needing 
  more liquid (some of the reserved broth reheated). Stir rice from the 
  edges to the center and from the center to the edges. Place back in 
  the oven and check for doneness again in about 10 minutes. 
  Another way, which I'd more likely use, would be to bring back to a 
  boil (step 15), then pour into a slow cooker set to high. As soon as 
  there are bubbles turn to low. When done and the vegies mixed in, 
  it can be set to "keep warm" and go right out onto the buffet table.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The arrangement here is traditional. Today, 
  in Ghana, the meats (Chicken, Mutton, Goat, Beef) are completely 
  cooked separately and placed on top of the rice for serving. This 
  method seems to have originated in restaurants.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Reheating:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is best reheated in a casserole 
  in the oven.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This dish originated in Senegal with the 
  Wolof people and the Jollof Kingdom, but how it got to the rest of 
  West Africa is debated. It is best known today for competing versions 
  from Ghana and Nigeria. The quantities given in West African recipes 
  tend to be overly large for North America, but since I consider this 
  a party dish, I left it large. The recipe produces 5 pounds or 11-1/2 
  cups, which will serve 7 or 8 as a main dish,and 12 to 16 as a buffet 
  party dish. Note that this Ghana version can be made vegetarian, 
  where deep fried plantain slices are served with it instead of meat 
  or fish. Fish is the favorite meat in the Wolof versions of Senegal.
