This recipe features a <u>very traditional</u> mix of meats for amazing 
contrast of taste and texture - but Ata DinDin Sauce is totally flexible and 
can be used with just about anything (see <a href="qmm_atadds1.html#07"><b>Variations</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ata DinDin Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very important sauce, used in 
  very many ways. It is also made in as many ways - but our recipe is 
  exceptionally tasty, <a href="qjv_atadd2.html"><b>Ata DinDin 
  Sauce #2</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cooked. Chuck is preferred as it will cook 
  more tender and in less time, but any stewing cut can be used. Remove all 
  bones and excess fat.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cooked. This recipe presumes Tripe is 
  purchased cleaned and par boiled, as it is sold here in California. 
  I use Blanket Tripe, but Honeycomb Tripe can be used and will cook more 
  quickly. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html">
  <b>Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Ponmo:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cooked. This is dried Cow Skin, <u>very</u>  
  popular in Nigeria. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_cowsknz.html">
  <b>Cow Skins</b></a> page. Pork Skins, Chicken, Catfish, Mushrooms, or even 
  Shrimp could be used instead.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have any Beef Broth on hand, don't 
  sweat it - just use some Bouillon, as they would in Africa. A Maggi Cube&reg;
  would most likely be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Those who could afford it would probably use steamed 
  Rice, but any FuFu, boiled Yam, Potatoes, or even Pasta would not be out of 
  order.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; With the meats given above, a few whole hard 
  boiled eggs are often included in the stew. This stew can also be made 
  including Chicken Thighs, Wings or Drums, Catfish, Mackerel, Mushrooms, 
  Squid, Pork (if your religion permits), or almost  anything you  can 
  think of, and the Sauce can be used straight as a Pasta Sauce.</li>
