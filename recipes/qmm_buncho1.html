California? Well, it's almost impossible to find an unsliced loaf of plain 
white bread in Southern California - so here, a French Roll, same as our 
beloved Banh Mi sandwiches.

  <b><u>DoAhead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Make Curry of Choice. This can be made a day ahead or even more. Other 
    curries can be used as you may wish. You will need 8 ounces of Curry per 
    French Roll, perhaps a touch more. The curry should have a fair amount 
    of liquid to soak into the bread.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (5 min each)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut the top off the <b>French Roll</b>, well above the centerline so 
    you don't lose much volume.</li>
  <li>Using a sharp knife, outline the cavity to a depth of 3/4 inch or so. 
    Use spoon or other suitable tool to scoop out the bread, making 
    sure you don't get too close to the sides or bottom, and leave at least 
    3/4 inch at the ends. Do not discard the bread removed.</li>
  <li>Set hollowed <b>French Roll</b> on a serving plate and fill with hot 
    curry. Garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> and/or chopped <b>Red Onion</b>. 
    Place the removed bread along one side of the Roll, and a good pile of 
    the Carrot Salad along the other side.</li>
  <li>You may provide Hot Sauce at the table for those who want to spice 
    things up a bit.</li>
  <li>Serve with the utensils of choice. In South Africa, this dish is 
    eaten with the fingers, using the removed bread as a utensil for 
    scooping it out. Here, we're likely to prefer more formal utensils - 
    I prefer a salad fork for this dish. The final breaking up of the bread 
    will still be done with the fingers. The plate should be left clean when 
    you're done. One roll with 8+ ounces of Curry, the removed Bread, and the 
    Salad should be plenty for most people.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bread Loaf:</h3> &nbsp; In South Africa this would be a regular size 
  unsliced rectangular loaf of white bread with a square cross section. An 
  authoritive South African calls it "Government Bread". A Bunny most commonly 
  uses a quarter loaf (kota) but can be a half loaf or even whole loaf. Here 
  in   Southern California an unsliced loaf of plain white bread is very 
  difficult to find, so this recipe uses the same French Rolls as our Ban Mi 
  sandwiches. For children it is recommended to use smaller rolls with a curry 
  that's not too chili hot.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Thought to originate as "Bania Chow", named 
  for a caste of Indian merchants who ran restaurants in the Durban Indian 
  communities. It was originally vegetarian, a version now known as a 
  "Beans Bunny", but today it is most commonly a meat curry. This dish 
  became popular in Durban around 1940. Some say it was invented earlier 
  by Indian sugar cane workers to carry their lunch in. This  seems highly 
  unlikely, as the curry quickly turns the bottom of the white bread into 
  mush, not real good for carrying. Bunny Chow has also been sold in 
  Zimbabwe, and is still sold there in the town of Kadoma.</li>
