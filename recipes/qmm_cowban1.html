A popular stew in the Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya region, where green bananas 
are a major cooking ingredient. The "authentic" banana is not available 
in North America, but we have a work-around.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Tomato Sauce</b> with Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine, Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. 
    cut the slices into threads and chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>SEASONING items</b>.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GREEN BANANAS</b> and cut into 3/4 inch lengths. Hold in 
    cold water until needed. Actually, it's best to prepare the 
    Bananas just before they go into the stew.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Beef Cubes</b> stirring until lightly browned all over. 
    Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions</b> to the pan and fry stirring until threatening 
    to color, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> until garlic is fragrant.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> for 30 seconds, then stir in 
    <b>Tomato mix</b>. Cook stirring often until tomatoes are soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b>, then stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and 
    <b>Water</b>. Fast simmer covered until Beef is tender (1-1/4 to 
    1-3/4 hours).</li>
  <li><u>At appropriate time</u> (see <a href="qmm_cowban1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>), 
    stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and <b>Bananas</b>. Simmer until both Beef 
    and Bananas are cooked,</li>
  <li>Check liquid and seasoning. Adjust if needed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of <b>Steamed Rice</b> (Jasmine or Basmati).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with excess fat removed. 
  This can be any stewing cut, but Chuck will be more tender and 
  cook faster than round.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using 
  tomato paste called for in recipes, I like to add a convenient 8oz 
  can of a very simple tomato sauce, which helps make up for deficient 
  tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple 
  sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bananas, Green:</h3> &nbsp; The proper green 
  bananas are Matook, the East African Highland Banana, but these are 
  totally unavailable in North America. Thai Bananas from Mexico are 
  often shipped quite green and are now widely available. They work well 
  for me as they are a relatively starchy banana, quite solid when 
  fully green. Don't buy them too far ahead as they ripen fairly fast. 
  If all you can get is regular green bananas, make sure they are so 
  green you can't peel them and have to use a knife, or they'll be too 
  soft. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/banana.html"><b>Bananas</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/bn_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Bananas</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>East African Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; You can 
  easily make a very tasty Curry Powder by our recipe  
  <a href="qys_curryea1.html"><b>East African Curry Powder</b></a>. 
  You could also use a Madras style powder (Ship or Sun brand), but 
  I recommend the above mix in this recipe. In Kenya, and possibly 
  Uganda, they would use <a href="qys_mchuzi1.html"><b>Mchuzi 
  Mix</b></a>, which is like our East African Curry Powder with some 
  beef bullion powder added.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Use the type and 
  amount of whatever chili powder or flake you prefer. I usually use 
  Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which are fairly noticeable in this 
  quantity. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Banana Cooking Time:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking time for the Bananas 
  can <u>vary extremely</u>. I have seen recipes saying 15 minutes for 
  regular very green bananas. The Green Thai Bananas used for the photo 
  example took as long as the Beef, 1-1/2 hours and were still fairly 
  firm, just a little riper would have been better. A Thai 
  Banana just ripe enough to eat (all yellow, very little black) took 
  15 minutes and was quite soft and sweet. You need to know your Bananas 
  - if unsure, peel and slice one and test simmer it.</li>
