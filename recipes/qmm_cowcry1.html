  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>Beef</b> into smallish bite size pieces, about 3/4 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes, a little smaller 
    for Bunny Chow.  Hold in cold  water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into rounds 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. For large 
    carrots cut the rounds in halves or quarters, especially if using for 
    Bunny Chow.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut slices into threads, and chop 
    threads fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Spices items</b>. Cumin seeds remain whole.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> Medium.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>OIL</b> and stir in 
    <b>Onion Mix</b>. Fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until it has completely lost its 
    raw color and all exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in all <b>Spices mix</b>, and fry stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>, <b>Cinnamon Stick</b> and <b>Apricot Jam</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then simmer covered, stirring now and then, until Beef 
    is about tender. Add <b>Water</b> as necessary to keep everything fairly 
    liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrots</b> for about 3 minutes, then drain <b>Potatoes</b> 
    and stir in. Bring back to a simmer for another 10 minutes minutes - see 
    <a href="qmm_cowcry1.html#07"><b>Acids</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato sauce</b> and <b>Vinegar</b>. Season with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Garam Masala</b>. Simmer until Potatoes are 
    fully cooked and Carrots are tender.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> - See <a href="qmm_cowcry1.html#08">

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef</h3> &nbsp; Weight is meat with all bones, thick membranes,
  and removable fat removed. Any stewing cut can be used. I prefer Chuck 
  because it cooks faster than Round.  This curry can also be made with 
  Mutton or Lamb.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake / Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This curry is supposed to be pretty 
  chili hot. If you want quite mild, use Korean flake or Allepo. I use 
  Indian Khandella or Reshampatti which are considerably hotter. Use your own 
  best judgement for type and amount. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Since South Africa was long under British rule, 
  you can use a Madras Curry Powder. Sun and Ship are good brands, but even 
  better is our recipe  <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder
  </b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This will give better flavor than whole 
  Tomatoes. Use a very simple tomato sauce. My favorite is Faraon Spanish 
  Style, which comes in convenient 8 ounce cans. Other simple sauces will 
  also work - even Goya Spanish Style, if you aren't still boycotting them 
  for enthusiastically endorsing Trump on TV.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but 
  varies a lot from region to region, and some from one household 
  to another within the regions. Here is a recipe for a typical 
  <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala</b></a> mix for the 
  cuisines of northern India.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Acids:</h3> &nbsp; The Tomato Sauce and Vinegar are held until 
  the Potatoes are partially cooked, or the acid will harden the outside 
  of the pieces.</li> 
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Curries of this sort are served all over South 
  Africa with rice, chutney and sambals (tart salads). The Indian communities 
  may serve it with Roti instead of rice. It can also serve as filling for 
  <a href="qmm_buncho1.html"><b>Bunny Chow</b></a>, as Meat Curries have 
  partially displaced the original Bean and Lentil curries.</li>
