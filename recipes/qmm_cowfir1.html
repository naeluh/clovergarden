  <li>If not on hand, make the <a href="qys_berbere2.html"><b>Berbere 
    Spice Mix</b></a> (15 min)</li>
  <li>If not on hand, make the Injera. For a quick version, see our recipe
    <a href="qeg_injerf1.html"><b>Injera - Fast</b></a>. This recipe 
    usually depends on leftover Injera. (1-1/2 hrs)</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/2 inch thick and into about 1/2 inch chunks.
    </li>
  <li>Tear <b>INJERA</b> into bite-size pieces.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Chop <b>GREEN CHILI</b> fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut slices 
    into threads, then chop fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Strip <b>ROSEMARY NEEDLES</b> from the stem, chop fine, and mix all

  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar (3-1/2 qt min.), heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Beef</b>, stirring until it has lost all raw 
    color, any exuded liquid has evaporated, and brown spots start to appear.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions mix</b> to the pan and fry stirring until translucent. 
    Take care not to burn the fond that adheres to the pan.</li>

    Fry stirring until liquid is almost evaporated.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered until Beef 
    is tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Injera</b>. Cook stirring gently until the bread has 
    absorbed all the liquid. Adjust Salt if needed.</li>
  <li>Serve hot liberally garnished with <b>Green Chili Strips</b>, and 
    accompanied by a vegetable dish (see <a href="qmm_cowfir1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>. 
    It is best to reheat in the oven in a casserole. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with excess fat removed. This can 
  be any cut suitable for stewing. Chuck is my preference as it cooks faster 
  than Round. In Africa, this would most likely be made with Goat, as Beef is 
  expensive there. Here in North America it is Goat and Lamb that are 
  expensive, and doubly so since half the weight you pay for is bones and 
  fat, so you need twice the weight given here, and more time to prepare 
  it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Green</h3> &nbsp; What chili is used in Somalia, I don't know, 
  but most writers of East African recipes in English call for Jalap&ntilde;os, 
  so that's what we use. One, plus the Berbere Spice, will give this stew 
  moderate heat. The Garnish Chilis will be mostly disarmed.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Berbere Spice Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most essential spice mix in 
  Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="qys_berbere2.html"><b>Berbere Spice Mix</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using 2 T tomato paste as called 
  for in the pattern recipe, I prefer to add a convenient 8oz can of a very 
  simple tomato sauce, which has fresher flavor and helps make up for 
  deficient tomatoes. My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple 
  sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Because this recipe contains its own carbohydrate, 
  rice, pasta, or additional bread is not needed. Consequently, if a normal 
  serving is 8 ounces, servings of this dish should be 10 to 12 ounces, so 
  this recipe gives 4 to 5 servings. A simple vegetable side would be good, 
  such as our recipe <a href="qsv_grnsau1.html"><b>Saut&eacute;ed 
  Greens</b></a>, or a salad.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Rosemary is not a common East African herb, but 
  here it is a relic of Italian occupation in the region, which still has 
  a strong influence.</li>
