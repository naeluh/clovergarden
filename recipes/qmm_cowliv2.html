This is an exellent traditional recipe for liver and onions to which 
we have added a few modern touches. Liver and other "variety meats" 
are very popular in Uganda, as they are in Eastern Europe.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45+ min - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>LIVER</b> and slice about 3/8 inch thick, removing any fat 
    and obvious plumbing, and pulling off external membranes. I usually 
    cut in strips about 3/8 inch thick and 1 inch wide, as it's not  
    easy to make wide slices of liver.</li>
  <li>Soak Liver in <b>Water</b> to just cover, acidulated with 1 t 
    <b>Citric Acid</b> or Juice of one Lemon for 1/2 hour or more (see 
    <a href="qmm_cowliv2.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Drain well.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice about 1/8 inch 
    crosswise. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
    off the skin under running water (see 
    <a href="qmm_cowliv2.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Cut into 1/4 inch wide strips 
      about 1 inch long. Mix with Onions.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasonings items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Liver</b> on both sides until just cooked through - right when 
    it stops being springy - longer and it will be tough. Remove from 
    the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and Fry stirring until Onions are 
    translucent - don't overcook.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning Mix</b> for 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Add 1/2 cup <b>Water</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Bring to a boil 
    and simmer about 5 minutes.
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>, then <b>Liver</b> just long enough to 
    warm it up.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Liver:</h3> &nbsp; Beef or Pork Liver will work fine (observant 
  Jews and Muslims are forbidden Pork Liver). Livers all taste much the 
  same and have similar cooking properties. The photo example was made 
  with beef liver.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>East African Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; You can easily make a very 
  tasty Curry Powder by our recipe  <a href="qys_curryea1.html">
  <b>East African Curry Powder</b></a>. You could also use a Madras style 
  powder (Ship or Sun brand), but I recommend the above mix in this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Soaking Liver</h3> &nbsp; Some people consider the taste of liver 
  objectionable - but there are ways to improve that. Many recipes call 
  for soaking liver in milk. I almost never have milk on hand - but I've 
  found more scientific sources that explain exactly why soaking in 
  acidulated water will stabilize certain chemicals that cause these 
  tastes. A few recipes say to soak in buttermilk, which makes more 
  sense than plain milk, because it's acidic.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Torching Bell Pepper</h3> &nbsp; This is not called for by the 
  pattern recipe, but I usually do it for any stew, especially if it 
  might be reheated. It gives the pepper a more delicate texture and 
  avoids annoying loose skins. With the <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
  <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>, it only takes a couple minutes.</li>
