Stews with Peanut Sauce are very popular throughout West Africa, made 
with Goat, Beef or Chicken.  Recipes for this dish vary a lot, so you 
can adjust to your needs, but the Peanuts are essential.

  <b><u>Pre-Prep</u></b>
  <br>These steps can be done a day ahead.
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: &nbsp; Place <b>BEEF TRIPE</b> in a saucepan with 
    water to cover. Add a little Lemon Juice or Citric Acid. Bring to 
    a boil for 10 minutes. Drain and repeat once. Drain. Starting with 
    9 ounces you will now have 6  oz. Cut into strips about 3/8 x 1 
    inch (35 min - 10 min work)</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: &nbsp; Dry pan roast <b>RAW PEANUTS</b> (see our 
    recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>. 
    Run in a food processor until it starts to cake, then add 2/3 
    cup <b>Water</b> and process as fine as it will get. (20 min total), 
    or see <a href="qmm_cowpnu1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> for an alternative.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: &nbsp; Place <b>STOCKFISH</b> in a sauce pan 
    with Water to cover well. Bring to a boil, take off the heat, 
    cover, and let soak 6 to 8 hours. Drain, remove bones and break into 
    small pieces (8 hrs - 10 min work).</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using: &nbsp; Soak <b>SMOKE DRIED FISH</b> for 6 to 8 
    hours. Drain, remove bones and break into small pieces. (8 hrs - 
    10 min work).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin. Cut slices into threads 
    and chop threads fine. Mix with <b>Onions</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HABANERA</b> open and add to <b>Tomatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHARD</b> leaves into strips about 3/8 inch wide by 1-1/2 
    inches long.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1-1/2 T <b>OIL</b> and stir in 
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until all raw color is gone and any 
    exuded liquid has evaporated. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and 
    set aside to drain.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> or as needed. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and 
    fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring until softened.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, <b>Tripe</b>, <b>Beef</b>, <b>Stockfish</b>
    and <b>Smoked Fish</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until Beef is 
    quite tender (1-1/4 to 2 hours depending on cut)</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using Peanut Butter, blend smoothly with 2/3 cup of 
    water</li>
  <li>When Meats are tender, stir in <b>Peanut mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Crayfish</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Chard</b>. Adjust 
    liquid if needed. If serving alone with rice I prefer a fair amount 
    of liquid. Bring to a simmer until the Chard is tender, (about 
    5 minutes).</li>
  <li>Adjust seasoning as needed. Some ingredients may be salty, so 
    adjust salt by taste.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of Steamed Jasmine Rice or an African 
    Mash.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with excess fat removed. This 
  can be a stewing cut such as Chuck or Round (which will need a bit 
  longer cooking).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; This is very popular in soups and stews 
  in Nigeria, so I wouldn't leave it out. Blanket or Honeycomb Tripe 
  will do fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
<h3>Peanuts:</h3> &nbsp; If you wish you can use the same measure of 
  Peanut Butter instead, though the flavor and texture will be a little 
  different. Smooth is usually used, but, <u>be sure</u> it's All 
  Natural Peanut Butter without sugar. Many markets carry only the 
  heavily sugared versions - peanut flavored candy for kids.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stockfish:</h3> &nbsp; This is Fish, dried in 
  the open air without salt. Since 1969 it has become a Nigerian 
  kitchen necessity ("I can't cook without stockfish"). For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_stockz.html"><b>Stockfish</b></a> page. 
  If doing this recipe Nigerian style, try to have it, but if not use 
  some other dried Cod, Polock or Hake. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfshdry.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted &amp; 
  Smoked</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Smoke Dried Fish:</h3> &nbsp; In Nigeria this would likely by 
  Smoke Dried Catfish or Mangala. If you don't have anything like this, 
  use Western Smoked Mackerel, very easy to find in North America, but 
  skip the soaking step. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshdsmkz.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted &amp; 
  Smoked</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / 
  Scotch Bonnet Chilis from the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. 
  Just one gives this recipe noticeable heat. If you're from the Frozen 
  North, you may wish to use only half of one, others may wish to use 
  two - use your own best judgement here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Swiss Chard:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for leaf only, without stems. 
  In West Africa, Fluted Pumpkin leaves, young Taro leaves, or Bitterleaf 
  might be used, but these are imperfectly available in North America. 
  White stemmed Chard is a good substitute..</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Beef and Chicken stock are used, but in 
  West Africa often plain Water is used with a couple Maggi cubes or 
  Knorr cubes.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Crayfish:</h3> &nbsp; West African Crayfish is Shrimp that has 
  been smoked rather than just dried. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_crayafz.html"><b>African Dried Crayfish</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>African Mash:</h3> &nbsp; These are the "rice" 
  of Africa, the bland starchy main dishes to which the strongly 
  flavored soups and stews are the sauce. Examples are 
  <a href="qsv_banku1.html"><b>Banku</b></a>, 
  <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Fufu of Yam</b></a> and  
  <a href="qsv_fufuc1.html"><b>Fufu of Cassava</b></a>. Since these 
  tend to be inconvenient in a Western household, I usually use steamed 
  Jasmine Rice, which is also used in West Africa if it can be afforded.
  </li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If making Ghana style, Stockfish is not yet 
  much used there, so some other dried fish would be good, or just use 
  more of the Smoked Fish. Most recipes don't include Greens, but I 
  like the greens and they make the stew look more interesting. Some of
   the photos on the Internet look really blah. </li>
