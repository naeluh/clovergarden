This satisfying stew calls for "Spinach". In West Africa, that means 
young Taro Leaves, which are pretty hard to find in North America, 
so we use Chard with a little lime juice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>

    skins off under running water. Core and cut into strips about 1/2 
    inch wide by 1 inch long.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with  excess fat removed. 
  Any stewing cut should work fine, though Round will take longer to cook 
  than Chuck.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very ripe and flavorful. If 
  your tomatoes don't measure up, use 16 ounces of caned whole tomatoes, 
  chopped coarse and include juice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chard:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for greens only. Use white stemmed 
  Chard if possible. In Africa "Spinach" is Kontommire / Taro / Cocoyam 
  Leaves, but these are not easy to get in North America (the amount of 
  oxalic acid makes the FDA nervous). Chard is a good substitute for any 
  greens called "Spinach" in tropic countries. We correct with Lime 
  Juice at the end of cooking because Taro Leaves are more tart.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; While Ghana recipes don't 
  call for it, I skin the peppers. as the cooking time is quite long and 
  I don't like tough skins floating around in my stew. This is especially 
  important if the stew is reheated.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / 
  Scotch Bonnet Chilis from the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. 
  Just one gives this recipe noticeable heat. If you're from the Frozen 
  North, you may wish to use only half of one, others may wish to use 
  two - use your own best judgement here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I have usually made some 
  stock from off cuts of the Beef bought for this recipe. In West 
  Africa these days it is common to use Water and Maggi Cubes. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi 
  Cubes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; In Africa they would 
  probably use tomato paste to make up for inadequacy of the tomatoes. 
  I prefer an 8 ounce can of a very simple tomato sauce. My favorite 
  is Faraon brand Spanish Style</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>African Mash:</h3> &nbsp; These are the "rice" 
  of Africa, the bland starchy main dishes to which the strongly 
  flavored soups and stews are the sauce. Examples are 
  <a href="qsv_banku1.html"><b>Banku</b></a>, 
  <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Fufu of Yam</b></a> and  
  <a href="qsv_fufuc1.html"><b>Fufu of Cassava</b></a>. Since these 
  tend to be inconvenient in a Western household, I usually use steamed 
  Jasmine Rice, which is also used in West Africa if it can be afforded.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; If this is made as a stew, I serve it on the 
  same plate as rice. If serving a "mash", it is usually in the form of 
  a ball, provided on the plate to be incorporated into the stew by the 
  diner.</li>
