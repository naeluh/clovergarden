In Somalia, this simple stew would likely be made with Goat, but Beef is 
much more convenient (and cheaper) in North America.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/2 inch thick and into about 3/4 inch chunks.
    </li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off the skins under running water 
    (see <a href="qmm_cowsuq1.html#02"><b>Bell Pepper</b></a>). Cut into strips 1/2 inch wide 
    and 1 inch long, or whatever works.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> and mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4hrs)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Beef</b>, stirring until it has lost all raw color, any exuded 
    liquid has evaporated, and brown spots appear.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions</b> to the pan and fry stirring until translucent.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer covered for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and simmer covered until Carrots are not quite 
    tender, then stir in <b>Bell Peppers</b>. Cook stirring now and then 
    until Carrots and Bell Pepper are just tender.</li>
  <li>Check Liquid and Salt, then stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> and turn off heat.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot liberally garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>, and accompanied by 
    <b>Steamed Rice</b>. The stew is often accompanied by 
  <a href="qjv_cilcps1.html"><b>Cilantro Sauce with Chili</b></a>. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with excess fat removed. This can 
  be any cut suitable for stewing. Chuck is my preference as it will cook 
  faster than Round. If you want to be super authentic and use Goat, you'll 
  need more than 3 pounds, as lots of fat and bones will have to be removed - 
  so allow more time too.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Skinning the Bell Pepper was not in the pattern 
  recipe, but I do because the texture is more pleasant, and it avoids 
  annoying loose skins if the dish is reheated. With the 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> it takes only 2-1/2 
  minutes. If you don't skin them, cut much narrower as in the pattern 
  recipe.</li>
