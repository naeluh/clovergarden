  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 3/4 inch chunks. Place them in a pan of 
    water and bring to a boil for about 1 minute. Dump out in a clean sink

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight (1/2 kg / 1# 2oz) is boneless with excess fat 
  removed. This can be any cut suitable for stewing. Chuck is my preference 
  as it cooks faster than Round. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="3">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Long Beans work better in stews than Green Beans. 
  They are also an Afro-Asian type bean, while Green Beans are from the 
  Americas. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long 
  Beans</b></a> page. If you have to use Green Beans, put them in a few 
  minutes before the Broccoli.</li>
<li id="4">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular White Mushrooms are fine for this recipe.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Berbere Spice Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most essential spice mix in 
  Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="qys_berbere2.html"><b>Berbere Spice Mix</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Niter Kibbeh</h3> &nbsp; [Niter Kibe, Tesmi] &nbsp; This is a spiced 
  clarified butter that is essential for Ethiopian cuisines. You can make 
  it easily by our recipe <a href="qid_niter1.html"><b>Niter Kibbeh</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Mekelesha Spice Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This is a mix of aromatic spices 
  used to balance spicy dishes. It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="qys_mekeles1.html"><b>Mekelesha Spice Mix</b></a>. 
  The pattern recipe called for O'imam Spice Mix, which is similar and 
  used similarly, but requires dried Rue Fruits. My Rue Bush is just 
  starting to set fruit, so there were too few to dry.</li>
