Adapted from Persia, this dish is popular on the Swahili coast and offshore 
islands of Tanzania. It can also be made with Chicken, Lamb, or Goat, and  
rewarms very well.

  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>WHEAT</b> overnight, or at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse.</li>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Chop <b>GROUND BEEF</b> well to make sure it isn't stringy.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine, Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. 
    cut the slices into threads and chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b>. Crush Bouillon (if a cube). Mix all 
    <b>Spices items</b>.</li>

  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4hrs)
  <ol start="12">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Onions</b> until lightly browned, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> 
    just until aromatic.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Spices</b> for about 30 seconds, then stir in <b>Beef</b>. 
    Fry stirring and breaking up clumps until Beef has lost its raw color and 
    any exuded liquid has evaporated.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Wheat</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer covered until Wheat is not too chewy. For Pelted Wheat this could 
    be up to an hour, for Bulgur, much less time. When nearly done, be sure 
    to scrape up the bottom of the pan often.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid to how you like it. This dish can be cooked dry, almost 
    like steamed rice, but it can also be quite liquid, like a stew.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot - see <a href="qmm_cowwht1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef, Ground:</h3> &nbsp; [Minced Beef (UK] &nbsp; This can be ground, 
  or, for a somewhat different texture, chopped fairly fine. For best flavor 
  use 73% lean, but certainly not above 83% lean. Don't worry, the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been completely 
  discredited as a fraud from the get-go. </li>
<li id="02"><h3>Wheat, Pelted:</h3> &nbsp; This is the wheat equivalent of 
  pearled barley. It is available from markets that serve a community from 
  the Mediterranean on east to Persia (Iran). This recipe can also be made 
  with Bulgur Wheat, which would eliminate the soaking, and the cooking would 
  be much quicker, but the flavor and texture would be quite different.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bouillon:</h3> &nbsp; This can be a cube to match the meat, or however 
  you prefer. In Africa this would probably be a 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi&reg; Cube</b></a>. For the 
  photo example I used 1/2 Tablespoon of Knorr&reg; 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_cowpowd.html"><b>Beef Flavor Bouillon</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This dish can be served with Steamed Jasmine Rice, 
  folded into East African Chapatis (which are identical to our 6 inch 
  Wheat Tortillas), or served with <a href="qsv_ugalc1.html">
  <b>Ugali</b></a>.</li>
