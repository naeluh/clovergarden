In Africa whole frogs are cooked, but that's unlikely in the US where only 
leg pairs are widely available.  The less adventurous can cook this 
recipe using chicken wings. The sauce overwhelms the frog legs by design 
- the legs appear as your rice absorbs the sauce.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Frog Legs:</h3> &nbsp; If you live in Louisiana or 
  some other parts of the US Southeast (and a few areas in the Midwest), 
  you probably know where to get frog legs. Here on the West Coast they are 
  commonly stocked frozen in markets serving Chinese and Southeast Asian 
  communities. China is the worlds largest producer of frog legs.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; White seeds are preferred 
  to black for this dish. You can also purchase already toasted sesame 
  seeds, but, as usual, doing it yourself is better.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet chilis dominate in 
  West Africa. One will give this dish just moderate bite, adjust to 
  your preference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html">African Chilis</a> page.</li>
