This is an exceptionally flavorful stew and a good value because you get 
a lot with a modest amount of goat. Goat is the primary meat in much of 
Africa, since goats do well in dry rocky environments other domestic 
animals cannot thrive in.

    <b>Ohleleha Bean Paste</b></a> (see <a href="qmm_goat1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Debone <b>GOAT</b> and remove excess fat. Cut into 1 inch cubes  
    (See <a href="qmm_goat1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>) and rub lightly with salt.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Dice 
    <b>BELL PEPPER</b> small, Chop <b>CHILIS</b> fine. Chop 
    <b>MUSHROOMS</b> small.  Mix all.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into small dice.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHRIMP</b> fairly coarse. Split thick end of <b>SCALLIONS</b> 
    and slice crosswise very thin.(white and green). Mix together all 
    <b>Sauce items</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or similar heavy bottomed coverable 
    vessel heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Goat</b> until all exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and it is lightly browned on all sides, being careful 
    nothing burns in the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stew mix</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b> and 1/3 cup Water. Bring to 
    a boil, cover and simmer slowly until Goat is tender (2-3/4 to 3-1/2 
    hours, depending how ornery your goat was). Tumble the Goat now and 
    then and add water if needed.</li> 
  <li>When <b>Goat</b> is tender, pour it all out into a bowl and hold 
    aside. Clean the pan.</li>
  <li>If your <b>Ohleleh Paste</b> is quite dry, mix in water until it is 
    fairly loose.</li> 
  <li>Heat another 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> in the pan. Stir in the <b>Ohleleh 
    Paste</b> and fry over moderate heat stirring constantly until oil 
    begins to separate or the fond stuck to the pan threatens to get too 
    brown. The objective here is to thoroughly cook the beans.</li>
  <li>Starting a little at a time, stir in the <b>Stock</b> until you 
    have the sauce consistency you desire. It should be fairly loose.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Goat mix</b>, then <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring up to a boil 
    and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice. This dish reheats 
    very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Goat Meat:</h3> &nbsp; - Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed. Here in Los Angeles I sometimes buy goat as random chunks, 
  sometimes at as low as US $1.99 / pound, but more often $2.99. These 
  may yield up to 54% meat or as low as 34% depending on how much is fat. 
  Shank end legs may be a better deal because they reliably yield about 
  64%. Loin end leg is more difficult to disassemble and yields only 
  about 38%. Bones and trimmings make excellent stock for use in 
  recipes. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ag_goat.html"><b>Goat Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Except for the super hot Habanero / Scotch 
  Bonnet chilis, African chilis are not much available in North America. 
  The popular pili pili is a bird pepper, with heat similar to that of 
  the Thai chilis now common in North America. Three Thai chilis will 
  give this dish a decent bite, four if you like hotter.  For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fresh peeled shrimp. 
  The use of large amounts  of dried shrimp in Afro-Brazilian cuisine (where 
  dende oil is also used) leads me to wonder if that's also used in Africa 
  for dishes like this. That's mighty powerful stuff, so experiment 
  cautiously if you choose to do so.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dende Oil:</h3> &nbsp; (Palm Oil) This is a bright orange oil used 
  in parts of Africa and Brazil, and needed to accurately reproduce the 
  flavors of those regions. For details and possible substitutes see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Red Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; 
  Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; That you made from the goat 
  bones and trimmings is fine, or chicken stock, or whatever have you.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Ohleleh:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard ingredient in much of 
  sub-Saharan Africa, required for many recipes, but a bit of a hassle 
  to make. For details see our 
  <a href="qip_ohleleh1.html"><b>Ohleleh Beans</b></a> page.</li>
