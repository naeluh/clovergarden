Goat is the main meat of Africa, but this hearty Curry can also be made 
with Mutton. It is satisfying and easy to make, though simmering time 
may be long (see <a href="qmm_gotcry1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>). It reheats very well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>GOAT CHUNKS</b>. Cut into large stew size chunks. 
    Large chunks with bones can be cut using a sharp Chinese cleaver 
    knife driven by a soft faced mallet.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine, Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. 
    cut the slices into threads and chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Coconut Cream</b> and <b>Flour</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 to 6 hrs - depending of Goat 
    or Mutton and what age the beast was)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Goat Chunks</b>, tumbling until lightly browned. Sprinkle 
    over <b>Lime Juice</b>, stir, remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Onions</b> to the pan and fry stirring until lightly 
    browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> until Garlic is aromatic.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b> for 1 minute, then stir in 
    <b>Tomatoes</b>. Cook stirring often until tomatoes are soft.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Goat Chunks</b> and <b>Cilantro</b>, then stir in 
    <b>Coconut Cream mix</b> and <b>Water</b>. Simmer covered 
    until Goat is tender (2 to 5 hours). Stir occasionally and 
    adjust liquid as needed - don't let it get too dry.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot with plenty of <b>Steamed Rice</b>. 
    You can spoon out some of the fat if desired, but this wouldn't be 
    done in Africa.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Goat / Mutton Chunks:</h3> &nbsp; Goat and 
  Mutton here in southern California are sold either as legs and 
  shoulders (at a high price) or as bony chunks (at a lower price). 
  Weight is for chunks with any excess fat cut off and any really 
  large hard bones removed. Smaller bones should be left in place. 
  You will have some loss from fat and hard bones, so best to buy 3 
  pounds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ag_goatc.html"><b>Cuts of Goat</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/as_mchunkz.html"><b>Mutton Chunks</b></a> 
  pages.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Anglo-Indian Madras 
  Curry Powder is good here - the English ran Tanzania after WWI and 
  would have brought this from India.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Goat, and especially Mutton 
  chunks have a lot of connective tissue that takes time to soften to 
  edibility, depending on the age of the beast. My worst case (so far) 
  was 5 hours simmering with Mutton chunks - the sheep was probably 
  retired from work in the wool mines. Lamb would be much faster 
  but lacking in the true flavor.</li>
