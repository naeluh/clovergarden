  <b><u>DoAhead</u></b>	 &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min to 35 min depending on meat)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove fat, thick membranes, and bones from Lamb or Mutton. You will 
    have to start with 2 pounds to 2-1/2 pounds to get 1 pound clear meat, 
    depending on boniness and fat.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>LAMB</b> into smallish bite size pieces, about 3/4 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes.  Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut slices into threads, and chop 
    threads fine. Chop <b>SERRANO</b> fine. Mix all with <b>Curry Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Whole Spices</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Seasonings</b>, except Vinegar.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> Medium.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hrs depending on tenderness of meat)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>OIL</b> and Stir in <b>Whole 
    Spices Mix</b> until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Onion Mix</b> and fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lamb</b>. Fry stirring until Lamb has lost its raw color and 
    all exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in all <b>Seasoning Items</b>, and fry stirring for 30 seconds or 
    so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer 
    covered, stirring now and then, until Lamb is tender. Add <b>Water</b> 
    as necessary to keep everything fairly liquid.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Chickpeas</b>. Stir in and bring back to 
    a simmer for about 15 minutes. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato sauce</b> and simmer until Potatoes are fully cooked.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and keep fairly hot if filling Bunny Chow.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb / Mutton</h3> &nbsp; Weight is meat with all bones, thick membranes,
  and removable fat removed. The photo example was made with Mutton. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/as_sheep.html"><b>Sheep / Lamb</b></a> 
  pages. This recipe could also made with Beef, Goat, or Chicken Thighs.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Use Korean Flake if you want the curry pretty 
  mild. Indian Khandella or Reshampatti would be considerably hotter. Use 
  your own best judgement for type and amount. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders &amp; Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but 
  varies a lot from region to region, and some from one household 
  to another within the regions. Here is a recipe for a typical 
  <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala</b></a> mix for the 
  cuisines of northern India.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This will give better flavor than whole 
  Tomatoes. Use a very simple tomato sauce. My favorite is Faraon Spanish 
  Style, which comes in convenient 8 ounce cans. Other simple sauces will 
  also work - even Goya Spanish Style, if you aren't still boycotting them 
  for enthusiastically endorsing Trump.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Indian community in South Africa has long 
  made curries of this type. Since there is nothing in this recipe that 
  violates practice in India, I have posted it there as well. Curries of 
  this sort have been used to fill South African "Bunny Chow" since its 
  origin, about 1940. The presence of Chickpeas in this recipe preserves 
  some tradition, as the original curry for Bunny Chow was vegetarian, Beans 
  and Dal. This is now known as a "Beans Bunny". This curry will also work 
  just fine with roti or rice.</li>
