This delicious stew is very much favored in Kenya, especially since 
it's easy to make, economical and high in protein. I've found little 
difference from one recipe to another, most often it's mainly whether 
Bell Pepper is included.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; In Kenya, Goat Tripe is 
  considered best, but it is very imperfectly available in North 
  America. Beef Tripe is also used in most Kenyan recipes because 
  it is the most available there too.  I use Blanket Tripe, as that 
  is most like Goat Tripe, and what I have seen in many photos of 
  Matumbo made in Kenya. In Kenya, cleaning the tripe is a real 
  hassle, but Tripe sold in North America is fully cleaned and 
  bleached, and will be lighter in color than Tripe home cleaned in 
  Kenya. For details and method of cooking see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Juice</h3> &nbsp; I use Citric Acid, which is easier, and 
  it's just the acidity you want.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; I have found the 
  Tomatoes on hand are often simply inadequate in both flavor and 
  color, so I add an 8 oz can of a very simple Tomato Sauce. My 
  favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, and I always have several 8 oz 
  cans on hand. Other simple sauces will work as well.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; This is an optional 
  ingredient, included in about half the Kenyan recipes I've seen. 
  Color is entirely up to you. If using and making ahead for reheating, 
  or if left overs will be reheated, I strongly favor removing the 
  skin. Blast black with your 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and Brush 
    the skin off under running water. I was going to include this, but 
    found my Bell Peppers had expired.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mchuzi Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This "Stew Mix" is reverse engineered 
  from "Royco&reg; Mchuzi Mix" widely used in Kenya. Many recipes also 
  allow using Curry Powder. This very tasty mix is easy to make by 
  our recipe  
  <a href="qys_mchuzi1.html"><b>Mchuzi Mix</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; What hotness Chili Powder you use 
  and how much is up to your own best judgement. I use 1/2 t Indian 
  Khandella which gives it a quite moderate heat. For details see our  
 <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders / Flake</b></a> page.
 </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; If you saved broth from cooking 
  the Tripe, use it. Otherwise use Water, or any other Broth you happen 
  to have.</li>
