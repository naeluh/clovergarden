Tasty and satisfying, this African stew is considerably more healthy than 
many spare rib recipes. I have increased the amount of ribs from  
the original to be more in keeping with American expectations.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (30 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>PORK RIBS</b> of any removable fat. Cut them into lengths of 
    about 2 inches (a sharp Chinese cleaver knife and soft faced mallet 
    are perfect for this). 
  <li>Lightly oil a large skillet. Add the ribs and brown them lightly over 
    very moderate heat, tumbling often, to  melt out most fat. Drain ribs on 
    paper towels and discard fat.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: Core <b>CABBAGE</b> and cut into narrow wedges.</li>  
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b>, <b>BELL PEPPER</b> and <b>CHILI</b> small. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix all with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Peanut Butter</b> with 2/3 cup <b>Water</b>.</li>
  <li>Lightly crush <b>Roasted Peanuts</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Place prepared <b>Pork Ribs</b> in a stew pot and add enough 
    water to mostly cover. Simmer them for about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>All items</b> except garnish. Continue to simmer until 
    ribs are tender, about another 45 minutes,</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice (also see 
    <a href="qmm_pigribcab1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The Habanero / Scotch Bonnet is the most used 
  Chili in Africa. They are quite hot so be cautious, but one should be 
  tolerable for most people. If in doubt, seed it, you can always add 
  some chili powder later if you need to heat it up. Adjust to your 
  preference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peanut Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Use only pure, all natural peanut 
  butter, not one of those kid pleasing salted and sugar loaded 
  concoctions like Skippy. I use Laura Scudders All Natural Smooth.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; As well as having about half the 
  amount of ribs I list here, the original recipe was garnished with 
  crushed toasted peanuts. I've never liked crushed peanuts as a garnish 
  so I used parsley.</li>
