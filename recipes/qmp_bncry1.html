<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Butter Beans</h3> &nbsp; These are very large Lima Beans of a light 
  colored variety. They are available canned (Goya brand around here) and 
  dry. You can soak dried overnight in lightly salted water, then cook until 
  just done, but success depends on quality of the beans, which is variable. 
  Canned are more convenient and reliable.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Red potatoes will thicken the curry more, if desired. Avoid 
  Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush if cooked a little more 
  than the minimum. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder</h3> &nbsp; The region having been under English rule 
  for some time, a Madras Curry Powder is appropriate. Ship and Sun are 
  good brands, but our recipe <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry 
  Powder</b></a> is even better.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but 
  varies a lot from region to region, and some from one household 
  to another within the regions. Here is a recipe for a typical 
  <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala</b></a> mix for the 
  cuisines of northern India.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This will give better flavor than whole 
  Tomatoes. Use a very simple tomato sauce. My favorite is Faraon Spanish 
  Style, which comes in convenient 8 ounce cans. Other simple sauces will 
  also work - even Goya Spanish Style, if you aren't still boycotting them 
  for enthusiastically endorsing Trump.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Indian community in South Africa has used 
  vegetarian Bean Curries to fill Bunny Chow loaves since their origin, about 
  1940. These have been largely supplanted by meat curries, but versions made 
  with beans, now called "Beans Bunny", are still common. I doubt the beans 
  originally used were canned Butter Beans, but those seem to be favored in 
  South African recipes today. This curry will also work just fine with roti 
  or rice.</li>
