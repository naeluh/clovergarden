  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut 
    slices into threads and chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Separately dry pan toast <b>Toasted Spices items</b> until fragrant 
    and darkened no more than a shade. Toast Chilis until browned in spots 
    but not blackened. Mix and let cool, then grind fine in your spice grinder. 
    </li> 
  <li>Mix <b>Powders</b> into the Toasted Spices.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> coarse and <b>RED ONION</b> small for Garnish. Use 
    the same garnish for serving plain or for Bunny.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>OIL</b>. Stir in <b>Onions</b>, 
    Fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b> and fry stirring for another minute.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Spices Mix</b> and fry stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring for a few minutes until 
    softened.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lentils</b>, then <b>Water</b> or <b>Broth</b>. Bring to 
    a boil, cover and simmer until Lentils are tender, about 45 minutes to 
    an hour.</li>
  <li>Check liquid. For Bunny you want more liquid than shown in the photo, 
    so it soaks into the bread.</li>
  <li>Use as <a href="qmm_buncho1.html"><b>Bunny Chow</b></a> filling, or 
    serve with Roti or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lentils:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for Brown Lentils. The 
  photo example was made with smaller Green Lentils, which hold their shape 
  more than the brown ones, which may not be ideal for Bunny filling.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; The standard Japones will work fine and 
  won't make the curry too hot.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you really control the chili 
  hotness, by what flake or powder you use and how much. I use Indian 
  Khandella or Reshampati, which gives the curry quite noticeable heat. 
  Use your own best judgement here. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but 
  varies a lot from region to region, and some from one household 
  to another within the regions. Here is a recipe for a typical 
  <a href="iys_masalgm01.html"><b>Garam Masala</b></a> mix for the 
  cuisines of northern India.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Indian community in South Africa has used 
  vegetarian Bean and Lentil Curries to fill Bunny Chow loaves since their 
  origin, about 1940. Meat curries are now very common and the those with 
  bean or lentil curry are now called "Beans Bunny". This curry will also 
  work just fine with roti or rice.</li>
