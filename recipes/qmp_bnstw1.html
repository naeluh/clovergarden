  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs soak - 5 min work)
  <ol>  
  <li>Soak 2 cup <b>DRIED BEANS</b> and  1 t salt (yes, salt) in 4 
    cups water for 8 hours or overnight. Rinse and drain.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>In a sauce pan, with Water to cover well. <u>IF</u> using, stir in 
    chunks of <b>Smoked Fish</b>. Bring <b>Beans</b> to a boil uncovered and 
    skim off the scum that rises. Cover and simmer until very tender but 
    still mostly intact. Check water often to make sure it just covers the 
    beans. This will be about 40 minutes for Honey Beans and African Brown 
    Beans, but a bit longer for Black-eyed Peas, depending on age of the 
    beans. Note that the beans in the photo example are more firm than 
    would be common in Africa.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Chop <b>TOMATO</b>, <b>ONION</b>, and <b>BELL 
    PEPPER</b> medium. Cap <b>HABANEROS</b> but don't core and seed unless 
    you're really chili adverse. Mix all and run in a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender until 
    smooth.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Palm Oil</b> and crushed <b>Bouillon Cube</b> into the Sauce. 
    <u>IF</u> using, stir in ground <b>Crayfish</b> too. </li>
  <li>Check <b>Water</b> - the <b>Beans</b> should project above the water 
    level when done, but far from dry. Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, <b>Salt</b>, 
    and <b>Pepper</b> to taste, and simmer another 10 minutes. If too liquid, 
    boil it down until it's the way you want it. </li>
  <li>Serve hot with Fufu, Bread, or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beans:</h3> &nbsp; This stew is made from any one of three different 
  cowpea type beans. most preferred is African Honey Beans, second is African 
  Brown Beans, third is Black-eye Peas (but preferred by some). For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_legumev.html#cow"><b>Beans, Peas, &amp; 
  Lentils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Two with seeds will give this stew a distinct 
  bite, one will still be noticeable. Use your own best judgement here. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>"Crayfish":</h3> &nbsp; Nigerian "Crayfish" is actually tiny smoked 
  shrimp (unsmoked they are just called "dried shrimp") Measure is crushed 
  well, but grind before adding to stew. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_crayafz.html"><b>African Dried / Smoked 
  Crayfish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Smoked Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Nigerian Smoked Fish is cooked over wood fire 
  and smoked until completely dry. Chunks are usually put in a stew or soup 
  just at the start of cooking. It can also be crushed and ground, where much 
  less is needed. For details see our page 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshdsmkz.html"><b>Smoke Dried Fish</b></a> page. 
  I used Bonga Shad with the skin peeled off and bones removed. One lady 
  reports she is quite happy with using chunks of Smoked Turkey.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is unrefined Palm Fruit oil (not Palm 
  Kernel Oil). It is much used all over Africa and in the Bahia province of 
  Brazil. It is available on-line. For details and substitute see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Red Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Bouillon Cube:</h3> &nbsp; In Nigeria <b>Maggi&reg; Cubes</b> are used 
  in almost every recipe, at home and by restaurants, but are not easy to 
  find in North America. I have them but usually can't find them, so I use a 
  teaspoon of <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Powder</b></a>.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi&reg; 
  Cubes</b></a> page. If you're strictly vegetarian, use something like 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_vegeta.html"><b>Vegeta</b></a> instead of the cube.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Try to use one or another (or more than one) of 
  the Options - unless you're a strict vegetarian. Some people keep the Beans 
  and Sauce separate, seasoning both with Salt and Pepper. For this method, 
  the Sauce is made as above, but the Red Palm Oil is not included. The Palm 
  Oil is heated in a pan and the Tomato mix stirred in until bubbling well. 
  The beans are then served with sauce spooned over.</li>
