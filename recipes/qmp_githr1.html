In central Kenya, Githeri is a nutritious but minimalist stew of whole 
beans and whole corn kernels. It has spread to other parts of Kenya with 
some elaboration (see <a href="qmp_githr1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beans:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer Large Red Kidney Beans, but other 
  beans can be used. Either 1 cup of Dried Beans or 2 14 oz cans of 
  Canned Beans will yield 3 cups cooked. For smaller dried beans you 
  will need 1-1/4 cups for the same volume. As always, make sure dried 
  beans are fresh, or they may not cook tender.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Corn:</h3> &nbsp; One 14 ounce can of Canned Corn will work fine. 
  Frozen can be used as well, but is generally considered not as good 
  as canned. If you use fresh cut from the cob corn, you will have to 
  cook it until just done. This can be done after adding Water by 
  delaying adding the beans until the Corn is cooked.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>East African Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; You can easily make a very 
  tasty Curry Powder by our recipe  <a href="qys_curryea1.html">
  <b>East African Curry Powder</b></a>. You could also use a Madras 
  style powder (Ship or Sun brand), but I recommend the above mix in 
  this recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes from the coastal region use 
  Coconut Milk rather than Water. Some cooks include a Stock Cube. In 
  its native region, this stew is made simply by combining dried beans 
  with dried corn and slow cooking until done, then served with salt. 
  It was, and is, the mainstay lunch in boarding schools, versions noted 
  for deficiency of flavor, and called <i>kagoto</i> (ballast) by the 
  students. The very poor make it with more corn than beans. It is 
  interesting that, unless you use Black Eyed Peas, nothing in this 
  recipe is native to Africa.</li>
