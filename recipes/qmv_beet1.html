  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> in plenty of water until a sharp skewer will pass 
    through the center of the largest one without hitting a hard spot (1 to 
    1-1/4 hrs). Drain, and hold under cold running water just long enough 
    that your can handle them. Rub the skins off and trim root and top. Let 
    cool. If you let them cool first, you won't be able to rub the skins 
    off.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into sticks about 1/2 inch on a side and 
    about 1-1/2 inches long. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Carrots</b> and cut into sticks similar to the potatoes, but 
    a little bit narrower.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice about 1/4 inch wide 
    crosswise. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very 
    thin, cut slices into threads, and chop threads fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cap and and seed <b>GREEN CHILIS</b>. Cut into strips about 1/8 inch 
    wide and 1 to 1-1/4 inches long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beets</b> into sticks similar in size to the Potatoes.</li>
     </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onions mix</b> over medium heat, stirring until Onions are translucent.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and 3 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in. Bring back to a boil, cover and turn 
    to a simmer for about 20 minutes, or until Potatoes are barely tender.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beets</b> and <b>Green Chili</b>. Season with <b>Salt</b> 
    and Bring back to a simmer until Beets are well warmed through.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Injera Bread or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; Buy moderate size beets with tops on, or at least 
  sprouting new greens. Storage Beets, cut close at the top, are usually old, 
  tough, and flavorless, and very large beets won't be tender. When trimming, 
  leave at least an inch of the stems, which will help keep them from bleeding 
  their color.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or Red Potatoes will work well in 
  this recipe. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes as they turn to mush if 
  cooked over the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; While it's not an East African chili, pretty 
  much every Ethiopian recipe in English calls for Jalape&ntilde;os. This 
  chili must satisfy folks who are "from there", so that's what I use. Cored 
  and seeded, they haven't much chili heat.</li>
