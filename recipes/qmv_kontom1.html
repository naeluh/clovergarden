This justly famous stew is not difficult to make - don't let all those 
notes frighten you. Recipes vary greatly, except for Taro Leaves, which 
aren't available here, so we use Chard. For variations see

  <p>This version is about as close to vegetarian as West African soups 
  and stews get, and can be made vegetarian (see <a href="qmv_kontom1.html#13">
  <b>Note-13</b></a>).</p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>FISH</b> as needed, depending on how dry, how salty, 
    etc. It doesn't have to be completely salt free.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Cut large stems from <b>CHARD</b> Cut greens into strips about 3/4 
    inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>EGGPLANT</b> about 1/2 inch thick and cut into about 
    1 inch pieces.  Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Trim caps of <b>OKRA</b> into cones, being careful not to cut 
    into the hollow interior. Place in a non-reactive bowl and tumble 
    with <b>Vinegar</b>. Let sit at least 20 minutes tumbling now and 
    then to keep wet. This helps keep them from breaking apart in 
    cooking.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin, cut slices into threads 
    and chop threads fine. Add to Onion.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO CHILI</b> open lengthwise and add to Onion.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Fish</b> into small pieces.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>In a 5 quart sauce pan, heat <b>Water</b> to a boil and stir in 
    1/2 t <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Eggplant</b> and boil until just tender. Remove and set 
    aside, keeping the water. Press the <b>Eggplant</b> moderately to 
    squeeze out excess water. </li>
  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Okra</b> and add it to the Water. Boil until 
    barely tender, about 5 minutes. Remove and add to the Eggplant, 
    keeping water.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Greens</b> into water. Boil until tender. Remove and 
    add to the Eggplant, keeping water.</li>
  <li>In a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat 2 T 
    <b>Palm Oil</b> (careful, it smokes at a fairly low temperature). 
    Fry <b>Onion mix</b> stirring  until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring until very soft, about 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Eggplant mix</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vegetable Water</b> as needed for Stew, or more 
    if making Soup. Bring to a strong simmer.</li>
  <li>IF using Egusi, stir it in now to get the desired thickness.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> and 3 T <b>Palm Oil</b>. Bring back to a simmer 
    for another 5 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and adjust if needed. Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> 
    and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with "Mash" or plenty of steamed Jasmine rice 
    (see <a href="qmv_kontom1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very ripe 
  and flavorful. If your tomatoes don't measure up, use a 16 ounces of 
  caned whole tomatoes, chopped coarse and include juice. Another 
  trick I use when the tomatoes aren't quite tasty enough or red enough 
  is to add an 8 ounce can of a simple Tomato Sauce. My favorite is Faraon 
  brand Spanish Style.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use 
  a long narrow Eggplant that need not be peeled. such as Chinese or 
  Japanese. You can just slice them into quarters lengthwise, then cut 
  crosswise. If you must use the big Globe Eggplants, you need to peel 
  them. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html">
  <b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chard:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for greens only. Use white stemmed 
  Chard if possible. In Africa "Spinach" is Kontommire / Taro / Cocoyam 
  Leaves, but these are not easy to get in North America (the amount of 
  oxalic acid makes the FDA nervous). Chard is a good substitute for any 
  greens called "Spinach" in tropic countries. We correct with Lime Juice 
  at the end of cooking because Taro Leaves are more tart.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Use the smallest, youngest Okra pods you can 
  find.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chilis from 
  the Caribbean now dominate in West Africa. Just one gives this recipe 
  just a trace of heat, use two if you want more. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Dried / Smoked Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Various types 
  Dried, Salted and Smoked fish are used. For the photo example I used 
  Salted Polock (similar to cod) soaked for a couple hours. For details, 
  see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfshdry.html"><b>Fish - Dried, Salted, 
  Smoked</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Dried Crayfish:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is ground. African Dried 
  Crayfish, unlike African Dried Shrimp, is smoked and provides a good 
  smokey flavor to the recipe. If you don't have this and can use smoked 
  fish, just increase its quantity and add a little dried shrimp. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_crayafz.html"><b>Dried 
  Crayfish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil</h3> &nbsp; This oil is essential to get the true 
  flavor of this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Red Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; 
  Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Egusi:</h3> &nbsp; This is toasted and ground 
  melon seeds used as a thickener in West Africa. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ml_egusiz.html"><b>Egusi</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10"><h3>African Mash:</h3> &nbsp; These are the "rice" 
  of Africa, the bland starchy main dishes to which the strongly 
  flavored soups and stews are the sauce. Examples are 
  <a href="qsv_banku1.html"><b>Banku</b></a> and 
  <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Fufu</b></a>. Since these tend to be 
  inconvenient in a Western household, I usually use steamed Jasmine 
  Rice, which is also used in Africa if it can be afforded.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; If this is made as a stew, 
  I serve it on the same plate as rice. If it is served as a soup, I 
  provide a bowl of rice diners can spoon into their soup bowl as 
  desired. If serving a "mash", it is usually in the form of a ball, 
  provided on the plate or included in the bowl of soup.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; This version is nearly vegetarian, most 
  West African stews aren't even close. The eggplant used here is usually 
  replaced by 8 ounces smoked fish, particularly salmon, but others too. 
  It can also be various meats, Beef, Lamb, Goat and even Chicken. The 
  dried and/or salted fish remains, but, in the case of other meats, the 
  smoked Crayfish or some smoked fish are still included.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Vegetarian:</h3> &nbsp; This version is close enough to vegetarian 
  to be made vegetarian. Replace the Fish and Crayfish with about 3 
  Maggi cubes or one of the substitutes, and perhaps a little natural 
  smoked flavoring, or use a Chipotle chili (or two) instead of the 
  Habanero. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html">
