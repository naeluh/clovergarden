This is a very popular stew in Ghana, mostly vegetables but not 
vegetarian. The amount and type of meats give textural and flavor 
relief to the large amount of vegetables. See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs) 
  <ol>
  <li>Cap and tail <b>OKRAS</b>. Slice crosswise about 1/4 inch wide.
    </li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water (a little more if 
    plum tomatoes), quench in cold water, skin and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>EGGPLANTS</b> 1/4 inch or less. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and chop fine. Pound in 
    a mortar.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANEROS</b> open.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>SHRIMP</b> in your spice grinder. Measure is before 
    grinding.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>FISH</b> and dice all other <b>Meat Items</b> about 
    1/4 inch. Mix all.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Palm Oil</b> and stir 
    in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until they are lightly colored.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger</b>. Let simmer 3 minutes, then stir in 
    <b>Okra</b>. Let simmer 3 minutes, stirring a couple of times.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Eggplant</b> and stir in. Let simmer 3 minutes, then 
    stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Chilis</b>.</li>
  <li>Simmer covered 10 minutes on low heat, stirring now and then.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Dried Shrimp</b> and <b>Meat mix</b>. Continue to 
    simmer another 10 minutes or until all ingredients are cooked but 
    not mushy - just 3 minutes if you're making ahead and will re-heat 
    it.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> if needed (some ingredients may ve salty).
    </li>
  <li>Serve with <b>Banku</b>, or with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select small young pods. Pods that have become 
  lumpy with seeds are too old.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very ripe 
  well flavored tomatoes. If your fresh tomatoes just don't measure up, 
  either use canned tomatoes, or stir in half a cup or more of a good 
  but very simple tomato sauce. My favorite is Faraon bran Spanish 
  Style, available in 8 ounce cans.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Select a long thin type of 
  eggplant or another variety that doesn't need to be skinned, such as 
  purple Indian or Chinese eggplants. In Africa, "Garden Eggs" (Ethiopian 
  Eggplant) are most often used. These are an African eggplant relative 
  unlikely to be found in North America. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Two Habaneros makes this stew quite 
  noticeably spicy by Southern California standards. Folks from the 
  Frozen North may want just one. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; These should be small 
  dried shrimp as found in Asian markets. Measure is lightly packed 
  before grinding.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Meat Items:</h3> &nbsp; These are highly variable. 
  All or some can be used, just keeping the total weight the same. 
  Weights are boneless, and Pig Feet are fully cooked. Salted Fish 
  can be Cod or Polock (cheaper). Chicken is not used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Red Palm Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This palm oil is much used in West Africa 
  and Bahia Brazil and is needed to accurately replicate dishes from 
  those regions. For details and substitute, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_dendz.html"><b>Palm Oil / Dend&ecirc; Oil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Banku</h3> &nbsp; This is a paste made from Corn Flour (Mexican 
  Massa) and Cassava flour, or grated Cassava, and fermented for at 
  least 3 days before cooking. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="qsv_banku1.html"><b>Banku</b></a>. This is not always on 
  hand in the Western kitchen (though fermented and dried mixes are 
  available on-line), so I suggest rice, which is popular in Ghana.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was twice this size 
  given here, and could just barely be done in a 3-1/2 quart 
  saut&eacute; pan, producing 4-1/2 pounds of stew. In Africa, this 
  recipe varies considerably from cook to cook and town to town, 
  especially in the amount of red palm oil and the types and quantities 
  of the meats used.</li>
