This Chicken Soup is significantly different from our normal North 
American Chicken Soups. For one thing, it's considerably more filling. 
For another, we usually don't include bananas.

  <p>The Swahili word "Mchemsho" means "boiled", and applies to several 
    soups in this style.</p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
    <ol>
    <li>Make your Chicken Broth from bones, skins, offcuts etc. Strain 
      it and defat using your gravy separator. For more details see 
      <a href="qoc_chk1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
    <li>While making the Broth, quarter a potato and cook it in the 
      broth for up to 1 hour depending on variety. Cool and mash well.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min) 
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite-sized pieces.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    crosswise. Cut slices into narrow threads and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut into 1/2 inch drums.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CABBAGE</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>BANANAS</b> and cut into 3/4 inch drums or half drums 
    depending on size and preference.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO</b> open lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol start="12">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed sauce pan or similar (3 quart), heat 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until

    <b>Bananas</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer covered until Chicken is 
    tender</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cabbage</b>, <b>Mashed Potatoes</b> and <b>Habanero</b>.  
    Bring to a boil and adjust liquid if needed. Simmer 5 minutes. Pull 
    out the Habanero if it's getting too sharp for you.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is Thigh and Leg 
  meat without bones, fat or skin. I buy Leg Quarters or Thighs with 
  skin and bones, then cut off the meat and use the rest for making 
  broth. A bag of Leg Quarters will make a lot more broth and chicken 
  meat than you need for this recipe</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potato:</h3> &nbsp; For the photo example I used White Rose, an all 
  purpose potato. It worked well, but a more starchy   potato might be 
  easier to mix in - but be careful it doesn't fall apart in cooking. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">Potatoes</a> page
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; A sturdy green like white stemmed <b>Swiss 
  Chard</b> could be used instead of the Cabbage.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Banana. Green:</h3> &nbsp; This is a regular banana, not Plantain. 
  It should be very very green as riper bananas are too sweet and will 
  disintegrate in cooking . I have the best luck finding some of the 
  smaller bananas in a green enough state, the regular ones are almost 
  always way too ripe. The small ones also make drums that are more 
  suitable for soup. A really green banana may have to be peeled with 
  a paring knife. If you can't get green bananas, use potatoes - White 
  Rose is good.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chilis from 
  the Caribbean now dominate in East Africa. Just one gives this recipe 
  definite sharpness. If you're from the Frozen North, you may want to 
  use half of one, but others may feel free to use two. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; When preparing for a dish of this type, I buy 
  chicken a day ahead as whole thighs or whole leg quarters. I remove 
  skin, bones and fat, putting them all in a pot and simmering for 3 to 
  4 hours, then strain out and discard the solids. Remove the fat using 
  a gravy separator. This becomes the broth for the recipe. It is strong 
  enough to be extended a bit with water if need be. For more on making 
  and storing Broth, see our page <a href="goo_stock1.html">
