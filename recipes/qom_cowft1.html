Originally a soup for the poor, this soup has become popular throughout 
Tanzania. Calf foot soups are considered hangover cures in much of 
the Western World, and it may be so regarded in Tanzania - the pattern 
recipe says it makes a good breakfast.

  <p>  Soups of this sort are a matter of taste, but I really like this 
    one.</p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (up to 3-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
    <ol>
    <li>Make your <b>Broth</b> and cook your <b>Meats</b>. Place 
      <b>Calf Foot</b> and <b>Beef Shank</b> in a pot with 6 cups 
      <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and skim off foam. Simmer until 
      meats are all tender - see <a href="qom_cowft1.html#06"><b>Method</b></a> for 
      special considerations. After reserving all the meats, strain the 
      broth and defat it using your gravy separator. Cut the meats to 
      soup size pieces.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (17 min) 
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise about 1/8 inch.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    crosswise. Cut slices into threads and chop fine. Mix.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Split <b>HABANERO</b> open lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed sauce pan or similar (3 quart), heat 
    <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until 
    threatening to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and <b>Lime Leaf</b>. Fry stirring for 
    about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in 5 cups <b>Broth</b>. Bring to a boil and stir in 
    <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Habanero</b>. Simmer covered until Potatoes 
    are tender, about 20 minutes. Pull out the Habanero if it's getting 
    too sharp for you.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Meats</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Salt</b> to taste. 
    Bring back to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. Adjust liquid 
    if needed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Calf Foot:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without skin or outer hoof, as 
  sold in North America. If not already done, ask the meat man to saw it 
  into sections about 1-1/2 inches long.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_footz.html"><b>Calf Foot</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Shank:</h3> &nbsp; this should be a 
  "center cut" piece with plenty of meat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_shankz.html"><b>Beef Shank</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Habanero / Scotch Bonnet Chilis from 
  the Caribbean now dominate in East Africa. Just one gives this recipe 
  definite sharpness. If you're from the Frozen North, you may want to 
  pull it out early, but others may feel free to use two. For details 
  see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1 stem stem. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; This is the broth made in the first step. Add 
  water if needed to make 5 cups.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I'm pretty fussy about 
  textures. When making the broth, I pull the Beef shank out when the 
  meat part is tender. I strip off all the other stuff and return it to 
  the pot. Soon after, I pull out each section of the foot and remove 
  the outer layer while it is still somewhat firm. The rest goes back 
  into the pot to simmer until the tendons are sufficiently tender. 
  Most else will have dissolved by then. For general details for making 
  and keeping stock / broth, see 
  our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This soup can stand on its own, but if I 
  want rice with it I provide a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice which can 
  be spooned into the soup as desired. It can also be served with 
  Chapatis, which are popular in Tanzania.</li>
