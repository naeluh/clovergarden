This simple but excellent soup / stew is from the Hausa People of the 
Western Sudan (see <a href="qom_cowgrn1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>). If doing 
ahead, stop just before adding the Greens and add them when it's 
reheated and just before serving.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>RAW PEANUTS</b> (skinless) fine. A Mini-Prep food 
    processor can get them fine enough.</li>
  <li>Cut stems from <b>GREENS</b> and cut the leaves into strips about 
    1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long. Weight is for leaves only.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into about 3/4 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Measure <b>Broth / Water</b> and add water if needed to bring it 
    to 5 cups (a little less for stew). Place <b>Beef Cubes</b> into a 
    5 quart sauce pan, pour in the <b>Broth</b> and bring to a boil. 
    Skim off any scum that rises to the top. Simmer covered until Beef 
    is tender, about 50 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat oil and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring 
    until just translucent. Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, cover and simmer 
    over low heat for about 15 minutes. Stir into pan with the Beef.
    </li>
  <li>Combine <b>Peanuts</b> with a little water and stir into the 
    pan along with <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Maggi</b> or other seasoning 
    (if used). Bring back to a simmer.</li>
  <li>When almost ready to serve, stir in <b>Greens</b>. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer just a few minutes until the greens are tender 
    and have a cooked taste.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of <b>Steamed Rice</b> (see 
    <a href="qom_cowgrn1.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a>). Reheated, this dish tastes fine 
    but the green color will be dull.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with nearly all fat 
  removed (see <a href="qom_cowgrn1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). I prefer chuck, but 
  round can be used with a bit longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for Leaves with 
  stems removed. The pattern recipe calls for Yakwa Leaves, confusingly 
  translated as "Sorrel", but actually it means 
  <a href="../ingred/mw_kenafz.html"><b>Roselle Leaves</b></a> (our 
  Sorrel is a cool climate plant). In North America Roselle greens are 
  very seasonal and difficult to find. White stemmed Chard works very 
  well with a little Lime Juice to match the sourness of Roselle. 
  Spinach or Sorrel would turn to mush too quickly.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth / Water:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  calls for making the broth with just the Beef Cubes, but I make a 
  stronger broth, which eliminates the need for things like Maggi Cubes. 
  I buy my chunk of beef early in the day and cube the amount of clear 
  meat needed for this recipe. All offcuts, including fat, go in a pot 
  and are brought to a boil, skimmed, and then gently simmered. After 5 
  or more hours, I strain out and discard the solids. I Remove all fat 
  using my gravy separator, and use the resulting clean broth to cook 
  the Beef for this recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Maggi Cubes:</h3> These are practically universal in West Africa, 
  displacing traditional fermented flavorings, but are not much available 
  in North America. Following my <a href="qom_cowgrn1.html#03"><b>Broth Method</b></a> 
  will eliminate the need for Maggi Cubes. If your broth is not strong, 
  and you don't have Maggi Cubes, the easily available Maggi Seasoning 
  Sauce can be used at about a Tablespoon per Cube. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi Cubes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lime Juice:</h3> &nbsp; This is added for greens 
  that are not as sour as Roselle Leaves. Omit if your leaves are that 
  sour.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; When serving soups with 
  rice, rather than spooning soup over rice as Asians do, I prefer to 
  provide a bowl of rice on the table from which it can be spooned 
  into the soup bowls as desired. Others have agreed that this works 
  well.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Hausa People:</h3> &nbsp; Hausa is one of the 
  largest black ethnic groups in Africa. They are concentrated in 
  northeastern Nigeria and southwestern Niger, but smaller populations 
  are found across the Western Sudan, as far west as Senegal and as far 
  east as Sudan. They are predominantly pastoralists and agriculturists 
  for whom cattle and horses are very important.</li>
