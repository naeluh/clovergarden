The name means "Somali Soup", but it's also popular in Djibouti and Yemen. 
It is made with Goat, Lamb, Camel, or Beef, depending on what's available.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with excess fat removed. This can 
  be any cut suitable for stewing. Chuck is my preference as it cooks faster 
  than Round. You could also use Goat or Lamb/Mutton, but you'll need more 
  than 4 pounds, as lots of fat and bones will have to be removed - allow 
  more time for that. Camel is also used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ao_camel.html"><b>Camel</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; What chili is used in Somalia, I don't know, 
  but most writers of East African recipes in English call for 
  Jalape&ntilde;os, so that's what we use. One will be hardly noticed in this 
  stew, but Cilantro Chili Sauce will help for those who want a bit more bite 
  (see <a href="qom_cowmar1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Skinning the Bell Pepper was not in the pattern 
  recipe, but I do so because the texture is more pleasant, and it avoids 
  annoying loose skins if the dish is reheated, which in this case is almost 
  certain to happen. With the <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen 
  Torch</b></a> it takes only 2-1/2 minutes. If you don't skin them, cut much 
  narrower.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Xawaash Spice Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most common spice mix in 
  Somalia. It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="qys_xawaas1.html"><b>Xawaash Spice Mix</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using 2 T tomato paste as called 
  for in the pattern recipe, I prefer to add a convenient 8oz can of a very 
  simple tomato sauce, which has fresher flavor. My favorite is Faraon Spanish 
  Style, but other simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving Options</h3> &nbsp; This dish is most commonly a soup, but can 
  also be a stew as shown here. When made as a soup, the broth is sometimes 
  served separately, in Djibouti beside the stew, in Somalia before the stew. 
  In any case, it is always served with Lime or Lemon slices for squeezing 
  in. Rice or <a href="qeg_lahoh1.html"><b>Conjeero / Lahoh / Anjero 
  Bread</b></a> always accompany it.
  <br><b>In Somalia</b>, when served as a stew, it is accompanied by Rice or 
  Canjeero Bread, and a whole banana. Bites are taken from the banana as 
  the stew is eaten. The stew is often accompanied by 
  <a href="qjv_cilcps1.html"><b>Cilantro Sauce with Chili</b></a>. </li>
