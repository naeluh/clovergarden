I have seen many Nigerian Fried Rice recipes with similar ingredients, 
but made all which ways. Some are made similarly to Asian methods, and 
that's how this recipe is stepped. This is often a party dish made 
larger, see <a href="qsg_ricfry1.html#10"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 hrs - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cook the rice with just enough water so it remains fairly firm and 
    grains remain separate. Cool completely. Preferably refrigerate 
    overnight which changes some starches and makes the rice easier to 
    handle. It will still work with just a few hours in the fridge. Make 
    sure nothing is set on top of it.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="1">
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b>. If large, cut into 2 or 3 pieces.
  <li>Place <b>LIVER</b> in a sauce pan with water to cover. Bring 
    quickly to a boil and cook until just cooked through. Cool and dice 
    about 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>VEGIES</b> of choice as described in 
    <a href="qsg_ricfry1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.
    </li> 
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLION</b> about 1/4 inch crosswise.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>

  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Fluff the <b>Rice</b> as best you can.</li>
  <li>In a wok (preferable) or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T 
    <b>Oil</b> over moderate heat. Stir in Liver and fry stirring until 
    just slightly browned. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and drain.
    </li>
  <li>Wash out the Wok or Saut&eacute; Pan and heat 2-1/2 T <b>Oil</b>.
    </li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>Chicken</b>, add it with the <b>Onion mix</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until translucent.</li>

  <li>Stir in <b>Liver</b> and <b>Shrimp</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice</b> a handful at a time, tossing constantly to

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; In Nigeria long grain Parboiled 
  rice (similar to Uncle Ben's) has traditionally been used, but top 
  cooks are now tending to use Basmati rice, favored in Ghana. Thai 
  Jasmine is also good for Fried Rice. In Nigeria, the rice is often 
  cooked in chicken stock or bouillon cubes rather than plain water. 
  1-1/4 cups raw makes 20 ounces cooked - 3 cups lightly packed is 
  about 18 ounces, but 20 ounces would be fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp or:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Shrimp are very 
  popular, but Chicken is also often used. Some recipes allow Shrimp, 
  Chicken and Liver. If using Chicken it is cut small and it goes in 
  with the Onions to fry. If using larger pieces it will have to be 
  simmered separately in advance. If you do that in advance, the 
  rice can be cooked with the resulting chicken broth.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Liver:</h3> &nbsp; Liver is considered essential 
  in this dish by many African cooks. Even one who says she normally 
  doesn't like liver says she likes it in this dish. Beef Liver is most 
  common, but Pork, Lamb or even Chicken Liver can be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vegies:</h3> &nbsp; 
  <ul>
  <li>Carrots: &nbsp; (almost always) sliced a little less than 1/4 inch 
    and cut to desired shapes around 1/2 inch. One lady likes to use 
    thin carrots and cut 4 lengthwise grooves so her slices look like 
    flowers.</li>
  <li>Green Peas: &nbsp; parboiled if fresh, thawed if frozen.</li>
  <li>Bell Peppers: &nbsp; diced about 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Green Beans: &nbsp; cut about 3/4 inch long and parboil until 
    barely tender.</li>
  <li>Long Beans: &nbsp; cut about 3/4 inch long and parboil until 
    barely tender (a bit longer than Green Beans).</li>
  <li>Corn: &nbsp; whole kernel canned or frozen.</li>
  <li>Cabbage &nbsp; shredded fine.</li> 
  </ul>
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Habanero Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes don't 
  include this - its up to you. One gives enough heat to satisfy most 
  people, but if you're from the Frozen North, maybe half of one. For 
  guests I might not include it, and if so, I have a shaker of Cameroon 
  Pepper Powder to sprinkle on mine. Cameroon is dried Habaneros / 
  Scotch Bonnets, very hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_africz.html"><b>African Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; West Africa learned about 
  Curry Powder from the English, so Anglo-Indian Madras powder would be 
  OK, or see our recipe <a href="qys_currywa1.html"><b>West African 
  Curry Powder</b></a> recipe.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Bouillon:</h3> &nbsp; In West Africa crushed 
  Maggi cubes or similar are often used in recipes of this sort. For 
  details and substitutions see our  
  <a href="../ingred/sa_maggcbz.html"><b>Maggi Cubes</b></a> page. I 
  use 1/2 Tablespoon of 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Powder</b></a>. If 
  <u>not</u> using, add a little more Salt.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil / Palm Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media 
  West Africa is Red Palm Oil. This will give <u>less trouble with rice 
  sticking</u> to the pan than other oils. Lard, on the other hand is 
  chemically very similar and has the least sticking problems. It also 
  has a health profile better than butter, and is far and away better 
  for you than the trans fats and denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has 
  told you to use. Do render your own lard though, it's easy. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Lime Juice:</h3> &nbsp; I have not seen this in 
  any Nigerian recipe, but it seemed to me the dish needed some tartness 
  and moisture. Perhaps I'm just oriented to Southeast Asian dishes. 
  I also sprinkle my portions with a little powdered Cameroon Pepper 
  (which is Nigerian).</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is often a party dish made quite large. 
  If you are doing multiples of this recipe, just before adding rice, 
  divide your stir fry into amounts your wok can easily handle with the 
  amount of rice that will be added. Also divide the oil. This will give 
  you better control and better flavor than struggling with a single huge 
  batch. For buffet service I pour the completed rice into a slow cooker 
  and put it out set to "keep warm".</li>
