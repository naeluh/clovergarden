This is possibly my favorite liver dish. It's a versatile dish, easy to 
make, and can be served as an appetizer with French Fries or similar, as 
a main dish with rice or some form of potatoes, or as a meaty side dish 
for four.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>LIVER</b> and slice about 3/8 inch thick, removing any fat 
    and obvious plumbing. I usually cut in strips about 3/8 inch thick 
    and 1 inch wide, as it's very difficult to make large slices of 
    liver.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and 
    cut slices into threads. Chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into 
    <b>Liver</b>. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 
    an hour.</li> 
  <li>Prep Onions: &nbsp; Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice 
    about 1/8 inch crosswise.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and cut slices into threads. Chop 
    threads fine and mix with Onions.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>CUMIN</b> in your spice grinder and mix into Onions.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Liver</b> on both sides until just cooked through - right when 
    it stops being springy - longer and it will be tough. Remove from 
    the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and Fry stirring until Onions are 
    translucent - don't overcook.</li>
  <li>Add 1/4 cup <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in <b>Liver</b> 
    just long enough to warm it up.</li>
  <li>Serve <b>Liver</b> garnished with <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Liver:</h3> &nbsp; Actually Pork Liver will work just as well 
  (Unless you are an observant Jew or Muslim), as livers all taste much 
  the same and have similar cooking properties. The photo example was 
  made with pork liver.</li>
