  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>If not on hand, make <b>Shiro Powder</b>. See our recipe

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7min) 
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Grate

  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Bring to a boil at least 3 cups of <b>Water</b> and keep hot.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir 
    in <b>Onions mix</b> and fry stirring until translucent. Sprinkle in the 
    <b>Shiro Powder</b> and cook stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Berbere</b> (if using). Start working 
    <b>Hot Water</b> into the Shiro. It should be lump free and quite soupy 
    at this point.</li>
  <li>Set to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes. Add water as needed. It 
    should end up thickly creamy. How thick depends on how you intend to use 
    it. Keep in mind it will get thicker as it cools.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shiro Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is Chickpea flour (Besan) toasted with 
  spices. For details see our <a href="qip_shirom1.html"><b>Shiro Powder, 
  Mitten</b></a> recipe. Note that it should be toasted <u>very light</u>. 
  Some people buy Shiro Powder on-line or from an Ethopian market. Some 
  people use plain Besan and add more spicing to the stew, though the flavor 
  will be a bit different. In Ethiopia Shiro Powder is also made from broad 
  beans (favas), whole dried chickpeas, or dried peas, but those require a 
  couple days of processing, whereas the Besan is ready to use.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; I strongly favor Red. Red makes a better garnish, 
  and I consider the fresh crunchy Onion garnish so delightful with this 
  dish I'd never leave it out.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Berbere</h3> &nbsp; (optional) &nbsp; This is the most important spice 
  mix in Ethiopia and Eritrea. There is already some in the Shiro Powder, but 
  many people like more - add to your own taste. Berbere is easy to make by 
  our recipe <a href="qys_berbere2.html"><b>Berbere</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Niter Kebbeh:</h3> &nbsp; This is Ethiopian Spiced Clarified Butter, 
  similar to Ghee, but flavored. Ghee could also be used, but I usually 
  use 3/4 Tablespoon of plain Butter. We have no need to preserve butter 
  here in North America, and the temperature it will get to is very low.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Reheat:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe will last for days refrigerated sealed 
  in plastic, and can be reheated in a pan with some water, then simmered 
  back down to the consistency you want.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some people add some tomato paste to make the 
  recipe redder. Refrigerated, Shiro Wat is quite solid, and is 
  sometimes cut into dice and used like croutons in salads.</li>
