  <b><u>METHOD #1</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Mix <b>All Items</b> in a suitable saucepan. Beat vigorously 
    until it is entirely lump free.</li>
  <li>Over moderate heat, starting a bit higher and reducing during 
    stirring, stir constantly with a wooden spatula until the Banku 
    reaches the firmness where it can be formed into balls and won't 
    stick to your hands while doing so.</li>
  <li>Scoop <b>Banku</b> onto your cutting board or other suitable 
    surface. When it is cool enough to handle, form it into serving 
    balls of the desired size and wrap each with plastic wrap to keep 
    them from drying out.</li>
  <li>Serve slightly warm to quite warm with soups or stews.</li>
    </ol>
   <br>

  <b><u>METHOD #2</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 to 4 days - 40 min work)
  <br><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; Proportions of corn flour to cassava is 
    variable by taste, even to 100% corn flour.
  <ol>
  <li>Mix <b>All Items</b> in a bowl and massage with just enough water 
    to moisten it all. </li>
  <li>Cover with a clean cloth and set the bowl in a warm place, such 
    as the top of a refrigerator. Keep the cloth clean and damp, and 
    turn the flour twice a day to prevent mold, let it ferment until it 
    has a pleasantly sour odor, 2 to 4 days depending on temperature. 
    Do not ferment it beyond that stage.</li>
  <li>Knead the dough again to make sure the ingredients are evenly 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Place 2/3 cup of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over 
    moderate heat. Slowly stir in spoons of the <b>Banku dough</b>. 
    Keep adding and stirring constantly with a wooden spatula until the 
    Banku reaches the desired firmness. If it seems too dry, add a 
    little water around the edges of the pan and mix it in. It is done 
    when it can be formed into balls and won't stick to your hands 
    while doing so, This could be up to 20 minutes. </li>
  <li>Scoop <b>Banku</b> onto your cutting board or other suitable 
    surface. When it is cool enough to handle, form it into serving 
    balls of the desired size and wrap each with plastic wrap to keep 
    them from drying out.</li>
  <li>Serve slightly warm to hot as desired, with soups or stews.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Banku Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This product, usually made in Ghana, is 
  available on-line in North America. This combined flour is already 
  fermented. That used for the photo example (the weather was too cold 
  for fermenting) was purchased from Motherlands Finest for 2018 US 
  $7.99 for 2.2 pounds plus shipping for a total of $12.68.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Corn Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This should be plain white corn flour, 
  ground very fine. I've used Albers White Corn Meal ground (in batches) 
  in my spice grinder to make it much finer. Mexican 
  White Corn Masa Flour (Masa de Herina) is reported to work well.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cassava / Yuca:</h3> &nbsp; This root vegetable 
  can constitute up to 50% of the mix to be fermented, or may not be 
  included at all. It is widely available in North America. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / 
  Yuca</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Related Items:</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Kenkey / Dokunu:</b> &nbsp; This variation on Banku is very 
    popular in Ghana. It is much firmer than Banku and is often 
    sliced. It is fermented the same way, but no Cassava is included. 
    Once fermented, half is cooked like Banku. The uncooked cooked 
    portion is then mixed in. Balls of dough are wrapped in Corn Husks 
    (Ga tribes, Southeastern Ghana) or Banana Leaves (Fante tribes, 
    Southwestern Ghana) and steamed or boiled.</li>
  <li><b>Akpele:</b> &nbsp; Some sources say Akpele is just the Ewe name 
    for Banku, but that is apparently not exact - it is made from 
    unfermented Corn Flour and no Cassava.</li>  
  <li><b>Fufu:</b> &nbsp; This "mash" is used all over Sub-Saharan 
    Africa similarly to how Banku is used. In West Africa it is usually 
    made from Yams, or Yams and unripe Plantains. See our recipe 
    <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Fufu of Yam</b></a>.</li>
