Fufu is a very important "mash" in West and Central Africa. As with rice 
in Asia, mashes are the main dish, and other dishes are the "sides". 
Cassava Fufu is the most popular in Central Africa.

Unlike the many dishes of Asia, Africans usually have only one other dish 
with their mash, usually a strongly flavored stew or soup. Here we list 
Fufu as a "side dish" because we, in the Americas and Europe, will most 
likely use it that way.

  <h3><u>California Method</u></h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <br><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; this method may not be safe outside 
    the United States.
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>CASSAVA ROOT</b> until there is no trace of skin. A "Y" 
    vegetable peeler works fine for this.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Cassava Root</b> into about 3 pieces, place in a sauce pan 
    with water to cover well. Bring to a boil and hold at a slow boil 
    uncovered until the Cassava Root is well tender (10 to 15 minutes). 
    It will probably split up a bit.</li>
  <li>Drain, discarding the water, and cool. Break it up a bit. Pull out 
    the hard fibrous core. Pound to paste in a big mortar (a Thai / Lao 
    clay mortar with wooden pestel works fine) - or use a stand mixer 
    with the open paddle.</li>
  <li>Mold into balls or cylinders as desired. For storage, wrap in 
    plastic and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Warm serving size balls are often set into bowls of soup or stew to 
    be broken up by the diner.</ol>
  <h3><u>Traditional Method</u></h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 days)
  <br>This is the way it's done in Africa with moderaely bitter Cassava.
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>CASSAVA ROOT</b> until there is no trace of skin. A "Y" 
    shaped vegetable peeler works for this.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Cassava Root</b> into largish chunks. Put it a non-reactive 
    container and cover it with water.  Set it in a warm place for 
    4 to 5 days to ferment.  It should be fairly soft when ready.</li>
  <li>Pound to paste in a big mortar (or run in a food processor (a 
    little water may be needed)). See also 
    <a href="qsv_fufuc1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan over moderate heat, adding hot water as needed, stir 
    continuously until fufu is entirely cooked. This will take 
    10 to 15 minutes depending on quantity. It will end up looking 
    a little glossy, and be of a consistency that can be molded into 
    balls.</li>
  <li>Cool - then mold into balls or cylinders as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cassava Roots:</h3> &nbsp; For the <b>California 
  Method</b> the wax coated roots sold in markets in the United States 
  are the sweet "low cyanide" kind and can be used. The FDA won't let us 
  have any of the bitter kinds here, so just a simple boiling is fine. 
  In other countries, better to use the <b>Traditional Method</b>. 
  During the fermentation period, an enzyme in the Cassava Roots 
  gradually destroys the toxic cyanide.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Raw Storage:</h3> &nbsp; If you will not be 
  cooking your raw processed Cassava right away, it will store better 
  if you squeeze out as much liquid as possible using a cheese cloth 
  wrapping. It can then be bagged in plastic and refrigerated for a 
  few days or frozen for longer.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The photo specimen was made 
  by the "California" method, and only lightly mashed. Naturally there 
  will be some difference in flavor compared to the Traditional Method, 
  but actually, it tastes quite similar to Gari, which <u>is</u> 
  fermented Cassava. In any case, in Africa they'll use any starch they 
  can get and process it into Fufu by whatever means that works, so I 
  offer no appologies. Actually, the "California" method is the same as 
  making Fufu from Yam, just easier to mash. Cassava is the most used 
  vegetable in Central Africa while 
  <a href="qsv_fufuy1.html"><b>Yam Fufu</b></a> is the most popular 
  in West Africa.</li>
