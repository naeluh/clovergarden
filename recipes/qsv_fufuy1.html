Fufu is a very important "mash" in West and Central Africa. As with rice 
in Asia, mashes are the main dish, and other dishes are the "sides". 
Yam Fufu is the most popular in West Africa.

Unlike the many dishes of Asia, Africans usually have only one other dish 
with their mash, usually a strongly flavored stew or soup. Here we list 
Fufu as a "side dish" because we, in the Americas and Europe, will most 
likely use it that way.

  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut 2 to 3 inches from both ends of <b>YAMS</b>. Experts say 
    the ends don't have enough starch, and the stem end tends to be 
    fibrous and bitter. Those parts can be used in recipes calling 
    for Yams. I cut a little closer to the ends than they do, because 
    texture isn't as critical for me, my fufu won't be used as the  
    eating utensil.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Yams</b> and cut away discolored spots or other defects. 
    Slice 3/4 to 1 inch thick and cut slices into cubes.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Yam Cubes</b> in a saucepan with water to cover well. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer about 15 to 20 minutes depending on 
    the yams. They are done when the crush easily with a fork.</li>
  <li>Scoop the <b>Yam Cubes</b> out and drain them well. Reserve at 
    least some of the cooking water.</li>
  <li>Now you have a choice of how to proceed. 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Mortar:</b> &nbsp; Pound it in a big mortar. This is the 
      traditional way, but is rather labor intensive and time consuming. 
      In Africa, where large batches are made, it's usually pounded in 
      a mortar made from a piece of tree trunk, with a pestle so long 
      you do the pounding standing up. If I had to do it this way, I'd 
      use a big clay mortar from Thailand that comes with a wooden 
      pestle.</li>
    <li><b>Stand Mixer:</b>. This is my preference as I have a powerful 
      KitchenAid mixer. You use the open work paddle blade, though I 
      have seen a video where the dough hook was used.</li>
    <li><b>Food Processor:</b> &nbsp; This is also a good way to "pound" 
      the Yam. Use the metal blade and don't overload the processor. 
      Scrape down the bowl as needed.</li>
      </ul>
  <li>If you need to adjust the consistency, very cautiously stir in a 
    little of the cooking water. Don't get it too loose. You should be 
    able to form lumps that can be used to pick up sauce from a stew.
    </li>
  <li>In some regions, a small amount of butter, say 1 Tablespoon to 
    2 pounds of Yam, is worked in, and Westerners might like a touch of 
    salt.</li>
  <li>You can now form it into shapes if you wish. Most used in Africa 
    is just one big pie from which family members pull off pieces as 
    needed. It can also be formed into small logs for individual 
    serving, or into balls.</li>
  <li>If not serving immediately, keep in plastic wrap or similar because 
    it will quickly dry on the outside.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Yams:</h3> &nbsp; These must be True White or 
  Yellow Yams, not the orange sweet potatoes called "yams" in North 
  America. White Yams can be found in markets serving Southeast Asian, 
  Caribbean, African and South Asian communities. Yellow Yams are also 
  used in Africa, but I have not seen them here in Southern California. 
  For details see our    <a href="../ingred/ym_yamtz.html">
  <b>Yam, White / Yellow</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Paddy Rice is grown in 
  Senegal and Gambia, where it alternates with Fufu on the table, 
  but even there most rice consumed must be imported. Most of Africa 
  grows Upland Rice, which has a much lower yield, and with far lower 
  total production.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; There are many variations 
  to Fufu. Here are a few.
  <ul>
  <li>In West Africa, Yam Fufu is sometimes made mixed half and half with 
    unripe Plantains (just starting to turn yellow). These are boiled in 
    the skins, then peeled and mashed with the yams.</li>
  <li>Cassava is the most common vegetable used in Central Africa, but 
    is also used in West Africa. See our  
    <a href="qsv_fufuc1.html"><b>Cassava Fufu</b></a> recipe for two 
    ways to make it (30 minutes, 5 days).</li>
  <li>Fufu of just Plantains is also made, particularly in the Caribbean, 
    but also in West Africa.</li>
  <li>Fufu of Corn Flour (Maize, Masa), called Ugali In Kenya and 
    Tanzania, is made throughout East and Southern Africa, under many 
    different names.</li> 
  </ul>
