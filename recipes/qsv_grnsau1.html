A delicious side dishes to East African stews. With torn Injera bread on the 
side, it can be a fine light lunch for two, one even a Vegan can enjoy.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>For <b>Chard:</b> &nbsp; Rinse well. Cut out central stems and cut them 
      into narrow strips about 1 inch long. Cut or tear leaves into pieces 
      a couple square inches in size. Keep separate from stems.
    <br>For <b>Mustard Greens</b> or <b>Kale:</b> &nbsp; Rinse well. Cut 
      out central stems and discard thick ones. Smaller stems can be kept 
      separate and cut to 1 inch long. Cut or tear leaves into pieces a 
      couple of square inches in size.</li>
  <li>Dice some of the <b>ONION</b> small and set aside for Garnish. Chop 
    the rest fine. 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, 
    cut slices into threads, and chop the threads fine. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or coverable wok, heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir 
    in <b>Onions</b> and fry stirring until translucent, then stir in 
    <b>Garlic mix </b> and fry stirring until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stems</b> (if set aside) and <b>Salt</b>.  stirring often 
    until almost tender (5 minutes for Chard). Add a couple tablespoons of 
    Water if needed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Leaves</b>, a big handful at a time (unless 
    using a wok), and stir up the Onions and Stems over the Greens. When 
    they are coated with oil and partially wilted, cover tightly and cook 
    until tender, stirring a couple of times. Add a touch of water if needed 
    - it should end up with no free liquid.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Diced Onion</b> or as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Greens:</h3>
  <br><b>Chard:</b> &nbsp; White stemmed is preferred, but other colors will 
  work OK. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ch_chardz.html">
  <b>Chard / Swiss Chard</b></a> page. 
  <br><b>Mustard Greens:</b> &nbsp; For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#mustgn"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip & 
  Radish Greens</b></a> page. 
  <br><b>Kale</b> Flat Leaf Kales are much preferred to Curly Kales for 
  African recipes. Note that African "Collard Greens" are much closer to 
  Kale than to the "Collard Greens" of the American South. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cb_kalez.html"><b>Kale</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onions:</h3> &nbsp; These can be either Red or Yellow. I strongly 
  favor Red, because they make a better garnish, and I consider the crunchy 
  Onion garnish important to this dish.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Eritrean versions (toe80,81) do not use the 
  Onion or Ginger. The Ethiopian "Gomen" is an African flat leaf Kale, 
  called "Collards" in Africa, but is much more tender than American Collards. 
  White stemmed Chard (my favorite) is also common in Ethiopia. The Eritrean 
  recipes steamed the greens for a few minutes to wilt them to make it easier 
  to stir in. I find this unneeded with a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan, but 
  if making more than one recipe I'd definitely use a wok.</li>
