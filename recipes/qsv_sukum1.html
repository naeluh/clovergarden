<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kale:</h3> &nbsp; Use Tuscan Kale or a similar 
  flat leaf variety if possible. The standard greens in East Africa are 
  Sukuma Wiki, described in African agricultural articles as varieties 
  of Kale. The translation "Collard Greens" may be correct in Africa, 
  but they are not the Collard Greens of North America - they are more 
  tender and wrinkly, and cook much more quickly. North American Collard 
  Greens came from Scotland, and you have to be really tough to be a 
  leafy green in Scotland. In Africa, cassava leaves, pumpkin leaves 
  and sweet potato leaves are sometimes used for this dish. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#loose"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, 
  Turnip & Radish Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>East African Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; You can 
  easily make a very tasty Curry Powder by our recipe  
  <a href="qys_curryea1.html"><b>East African Curry Powder</b></a>. 
  You could also use a Madras style powder (Ship or Sun brand), but 
  I recommend the above mix in this recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is very easy to make - except 
  cutting the Kale can be tedious - but you can do that a day ahead, 
  bag it and refrigerate. It's easier in East Africa where the kale is 
  flat with very broad leaves. Strangely, there is a Bantu tribe named 
  Sukuma in northern Tanzania, but in the region's Bantu 
  dialect it means "people of the north". 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>Add a Serrano chili (chopped) with the Onions, or other chili or 
    flake or powder as you like.</li>
  <li>Cooked meats, diced, may be added: pork, beef, chicken, goat, 
    etc. Ground beef fried until browned may also be used.</li> 
  <li>The dish may be thickened by stirring 1 T Flour and 2 T Water 
    into the Lemon Juice. Add it near the end of cooking.</li>
  </ul>
