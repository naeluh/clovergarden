While this seasoning is necessary to make the famous Banga Soup (Palm 
Fruit Soup) of the Nigerian Delta region, it is difficult to make an 
authentic version in North America.  
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Many of the ingredients have now been identified, but some remain 
mysterious. Various of them, and some mixes, can be had on-line (see 
<a href="qys_banga1.html#06"><b>Seasoning Mixes</b></a>). I have seen recent Banga Soup 
recipes that leave out all except the Beletientien Leaves or a substitute.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ataiko:</h3> &nbsp; [Otiako] &nbsp; Small seed used in Banga soup. 
  <u>Finally Identified</u>, <i>Aframomum subsericeum</i>. It may 
  sometimes be called Alligator Pepper, but that name is used for 
  several <i>Aframomum</i> species, including the much better known 
  Grains of Paradise (<i>Aframomum melegueta</i>). For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/gg_ginger.html#ataik"><b>Gingers</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Irugege / Rigije:</h3> &nbsp; These appear to be the same small flat 
  brown seeds used in Nigerian Pepper Soup. No information about these is 
  available, and they do not seem to be available in North America or on-line 
  except as ingredients in Banga Soup and Pepper Soup seasoning mixes. The 
  only suggestion I've seen for substitutes is that there is no substitute.
  Reportedly, they are gathered from the wild by women and sold at the 
  roadside in Nigeria.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Aridan:</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Aiden; Prekese 
  (Ghana (Soup Perfume)); Uhio,Uhiokrihio (Igbo); Uyayak, Tyko, 
  Yanghanyanghan (Nigeria); <i>Tetrapleura tetraptera</i>] &nbsp; Measure 
  is for <u>pulp only</u>. This medium size bean tree is most grown in 
  Ghana, but also east to Nigeria. It produces large winged bean pods 
  up to nearly 10 inches long. They contain a sweet aromatic pulp used 
  to flavor Nigerian Pepper Soup, Banga Soup, Palm Fruit Soup and 
  others. The dried pulp is available on-line in North America. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_aridanz.html"><b>Aridan / 
  Prekese</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oburunbebe Stick:</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; [Ikrabo Stick, Banga Stick] 
  &nbsp; This stick is used in Banga Soup, often inserted near the end of 
  cooking. It can be used several times. <u>Finally Identified</u> 
  (Sept 2018) by Kitchen Butterfly - it's Liquorice Root. Packages of 
  Liquorice root can be found (usually sliced) in Asian Markets here in 
  Southern California. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_licorz.html">
  <b>Licorice</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Beletientien / Atama:</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  [Obeletientien, Beletete; Bush Apple Leaves; <i>Heinsia crinita</i>] 
  &nbsp; Leaves of this plant are used fresh or dry, particularly in 
  Banga Soup. It is grown and used in the Delta region of Nigeria. See 
  our <a href="../ingred/gn_beletz.html"><b>Beletientien / Atama</b></a> 
  page for details and substitutes.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Seasoning Mixes</h3> &nbsp; A number of Banga 
  Seasonings are available on-line. Some of them contain only 
  Ataiko and Irugege Seeds, while others have one of those plus Aridan. 
  The one we use is from Allspice Emporium in San Francisco. Ing: 
  Beletete, Aidan Fruit, Obenetietien, Atariko, Rigije, Mint Leaves, 
  Oburunbebe Stick, which is a fairly comprehensive list, but it does 
  cost 2018 US $6.95 / ounce.</li>
