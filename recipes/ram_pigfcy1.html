<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  <ol>
  <li>Have the meat man saw up the <b>PIG FEET</b>. One cut lengthwise in 
    half and then into 2 inch lengths. Some markets that sell Pig Feet have 
    them already cut this way.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min &nbsp; + marinate 3+ hrs, or 
  overnight in the fridge)
<ol start="2">
  <li>Rinse <b>Pig Feet</b> well to remove saw kerf, etc. If there are hairs, 
    blast them off with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen 
    Torch</b></a>. </li>
  <li>Grind <b>Allspice berries</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin. Mix with 
    <b>Allspice Berries</b></li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into threads, and chop 
    threads fine.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILI</b>. Slice in half lengthwise and remove seed mass. 
    Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> with the <b>Pig Feet</b> tumble until 
    well coated. Set aside for at least 4 hours, or refrigerate overnight. 
    &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: This Marinade doesn't stick to the Pig Feet, so I 
    load  them into a plastic bag, alternating pig feet and marinade. Then 
    I seal the bag and shake it up a few times so all the feet chunks are 
    in contact with the marinade.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="7">
  <li>Heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> in a large saut&eacute; pan (5 qt) or a coverable 
    wok (you need a lot of room). Stir in <b>Pig Feet</b> along with all 
    <b>Marinade</b>. Fry over moderately high heat, tumbling often and and 
    scraping the bottom of the pan. When the reddish fond sticking to the 
    bottom of the pan starts to go chocolate colored, go on to the next 
    step.</li> 
  <li>Add enough <b>Water</b> to cover the Pig Feet well.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil. As it comes to a full boil, fat will cluster on the 
    surface and can be easily skimmed off with a spoon.</li>
  <li>cover and hold at a fast simmer until Pig Feet are tender enough to 
    eat, about 2-1/2 hours. Check the water periodically and keep the feet 
    covered.</li>
  <li>Uncover and  boil the liquid down over highest heat to make a sauce. 
    &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: know that you will have a lot less liquid and it 
    will be much more dense when served than it looks like when boiling.</li>
  <li>Serve warm or cool - see <a href="ram_pigfcy1.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; [Trotters] &nbsp; These can be had from most 
  markets serving an Asian or Latin American community. In North America, 
  Pig Feet are sold fresh, but in much of the world they are sold Salted 
  and need to be soaked in water to cover overnight. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Scotch Bonnet Chili:</h3> &nbsp; These are not much available any 
  distance from the Caribbean. I use the Orange Habanero that's so common 
  in Southern California. It's the same hotness, and only a Jamaican can 
  tell the difference in flavor. Other very hot Chilis can also be used. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder - Jamaican:</h3> &nbsp; It is important that Jamaican 
  Curry Powder is used or both color and flavor will be wrong.
  It can be made by our recipe <a href="rys_cpjamai1.html"><b>Jamaican 
  Curry Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Here is where you control the hotness of 
  this recipe. Aleppo Extra Hot or Korean for moderate, Indian Reshampatti or 
  Cayenne for medium, Habanero for hot. For choices see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In Jamaica refined Coconut Oil would likely be used, 
  but Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) will work fine. Unrefined Coconut Oil or 
  virgin Olive Oil can't take the heat. For choices see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp;  <b><u>IF</u></b> you serve these warm from the 
  pan, they are <u>very messy</u> to eat, so provide stacks of paper napkins 
  and a bone bowl, and finger bowls would also be a good thing. This recipe 
  is most definitely not for elegant dining, but we barbarians love pig feet 
  a lot. &nbsp; <b><u>IF</u></b> you chill them in the fridge for a 
  few hours or overnight, then let them come up to a cool room temperature, 
  they are not messy at all. In this form they are a fine appetizer.</li>
