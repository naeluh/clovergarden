Boiled dumplings are very popular all through the Caribbean region, 
especially Cassava Dumplings. They are used in soups, over stews, and as 
a side dish.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>peel <b>CASSAVA</b> (a strong "Y" peeler is best) and grate it. 
    See <a href="reb_casav1.html#02"><b>Grating</b></a>
  below for details.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Flour</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Baking Powder</b> in a mixing 
    bowl and whip it to make it even. Work in the <b>Cassava</b>.</li>
  <li>The Cassava has some water in it so the amount of additional water  
    you need is uncertain. Add in Tablespoon amounts. Work until you have an 
    even but fairly firm dough. Lightly oiling your hands can help here. 
    Knead for about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let the dough rest for 20 minutes covered with plastic wrap.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Dumplings</b> of the shape and size you want. All the shapes 
    below are typical of Trinidad, Tobago, Jamaica, and the rest of the 
    Caribbean.
    <ul>
    <li>Spinners are formed by rolling a small ball of dough 
      between the palms of your hands. They should be about 2-1/4 inches 
      long and pointed at both ends. Roll them longer and thinner than you 
      want, because they will pull back some when set out on the board.</li>
    <li>Cow Tongues (Trinidad) are formed by rolling out an oval of dough 
      on a lightly floured board. They should be rolled out about 1/8 inch 
      thick. Again, they will pull back when laid out, getting shorter and 
      thicker, so roll longer than you want. They can be considerably 
      longer and narrower than those in the photo.</li>
    <li>Soup Dumplings (Trinidad) are rolled out as a cylinder about 1 inch 
      in diameter, then sliced crosswise about 1/2 inch thick. They may 
      then be rolled into balls if you wish.</li>
    <li>Disks are made by pressing a ball of dough flat between you palms. 
      It should be less than 1/2 inch thick, a fair amount less because they 
      will pull back some when set out. Use your thumb to make the center 
      thinner than the edges. They should be about 2-1/2 inches diameter.</li>
      </ul>
      </li> 
  <li>Spinners and Soup Dumplings can be boiled in the soup, or boiled 
    separately. They will need about 12 minutes, which should be at least 
    a minute beyond the time they float to the surface. Cow Tongues and disks 
    are boiled separately, and timing will depend on thickness, again, at 
    least a minutes after they float to the top.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cassava:</h3> &nbsp; [Yuca, Manioc] &nbsp; Be careful buying your 
  Cassava. It is very perishable, so buy from a market with high turnover. 
  It should be completely hard with no soft spots or discoloration. If it 
  is over-aged it will have black streaks through it. You could use Frozen 
  Cassava if you can't get fresh, with a little loss of flavor. Some use 
  Cassava Flour, but that will have less flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Grating:</h3> &nbsp; Many recommend to use the punch hole side of a 
  box grater. This is slow and takes a lot of muscle power. Also, it's 
  very difficult to remove the hard core at (near) the center. I slice the 
  cassava about 3/4 inch thick, then cut each slice into quarters, making 
  sure the fibrous core is at the tip of one quarter where it can be easily 
  cut off. Then I run it in a Mixie (a Food Processor will also work) with 3 
  Tablespoons of water. This is fine because you have to add water to the 
  dough anyway.</li>
