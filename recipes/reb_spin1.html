Boiled dumplings are very popular all through the Caribbean region. Spinners 
and similar are used in soup, often cooked in the soup. Cow Tongues are 
used as a side or over stews.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b> in a mixing bowl and whip to mix 
    evenly.</li>
  <li>Make an indentation in the dry mix. Start adding water, perhaps 1/2 
    cup to start. Work it into the dry mix until you have a fairly firm 
    dough. Lightly oiling your hands can help here. Knead for about 4 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Let the dough rest for 4 minutes covered with a damp paper towel.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Dumplings</b> of the shape and size you want.
    <ul>
    <li>Spinners (Jamaica) are formed by rolling a ball of dough between the 
      palms of your hands. They should be about 2-1/4 inches long and 
      pointed at both ends. Roll them longer and thinner than you want, 
      because they will pull back some when set out on the board.</li>
    <li>Cow Tongues (Trinidad) are formed by rolling out an oval of dough 
      on a lightly floured board. They should be rolled out about 1/8 inch 
      thick. Again, they will pull back when laid out, getting shorter and 
      thicker, so roll longer than you want. They can be considerably 
      longer and narrower than those in the photo.</li>
    <li>Soup Dumplings (Trinidad) are rolled out as a cylinder about 1 inch 
      in diameter, then sliced crosswise about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
    <li>Disks (Jamaica) are made by pressing a ball of dough flat and 
      less than 1/2 inch thick, a fair amount less because they will pull 
      back when set out. Use your thumb to make the center thinner than 
      the edges.  They should be about 2-1/2 inches diameter.</li>
      </ul>
      </li> 
  <li>Spinners and Soup Dumplings can be boiled in the soup, or boiled 
    separately. They will need about 12 minutes, which should be at least 
    a minute beyond the time they float to the surface. Cow Tongues and disks 
    are boiled separately, and timing will depend on thickness, again, at 
    least a minutes after they float to the top.</li>
