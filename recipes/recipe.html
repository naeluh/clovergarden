<h1 class=s>Interpreting Clovegarden Recipes</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<br> 
<h2>Abbreviations:</h2> &nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>ar</b>=As Required, 
  <b>n/a</b>=Not Applicable, 
  <b>tt</b>=To Taste, <b>lrg</b>=Large, <b>sml</b>=Small, <b>med</b>=Medium, 
  <b>t</b>=teaspoon, <b>T</b>=Tablespoon, <b>c</b>=cup, <b>qt</b>=quart, 
  <b>oz</b>=ounce, <b>#</b>=pound, <b>cl</b>=clove <b>in</b>=inch
  <p></p>

 
<h2>Measures:</h2>  &nbsp; All measures are U.S. measure unless stated 
in metric units (not often). For tables of measures see our page 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/measures.html"><h3>Measures &amp; Conversions</h3></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Capitalization:</h2> &nbsp; Ingredients requiring 
significant preparation are shown in <b>ALL CAPS</b> at the point where they 
are introduced (usually the place the effort is needed). After that point 
the ingredient will be Capitalized.<p></p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2> &nbsp; This is how long the recipe takes - not how 
long you have to work on it. Check "Effort" for hints - ** and 3 hrs would 
mean moderate prep work and long cooking with little attention. Also the 
division headers will give you more information on this. Schedule times 
tend to be tight so don't depend on beating them.<p></p>

<h2>Effort:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>*</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; just do some cutting and toss it together.</li>
  <li><b>**</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; pretty modest, probably mostly cutting.</li>
  <li><b>***</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; average difficulty, needs a fair amount of 
    prep and tending.</li>
  <li><b>****</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; complex and a bit demanding.</li>
  <li><b>*****</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; heroic effort needed</li>
  <li><b>#</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; Beware!</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p></li>

<h2>Serves:</h2> &nbsp; If a recipe gives number of servings, our portions 
  tend to be quite generous (2 = one man and one woman, both of whom are 
  "good eaters") and presumes there will be little else served except a 
  starch (if not included in the recipe) and maybe a salad. Common starches 
  are rice or some other grain, noodles or pasta, or potatoes.<p></p>

<h2>Makes:</h2> &nbsp; For recipes giving weight or volume, you can translate 
to Portions: &nbsp; Soup course serving, <b>3/4 to 1 cup</b>; Main Dish Soup, 
<b>1-1/2 to 2 cups</b>; Main Dish <b>7 to 8 ounces</b> if served with a starch 
(rice, noodles, potatoes, etc.). If it is quite liquid, then <b>10 to 11 
ounces</b>, or served without a starch or much else, <b>11 to 12 ounces</b>.
<p></p>

<h2>Structure:</h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of our recipes are divided into 
<b>Prep</b> and <b>Run</b> sections. Those that are not so divided are most 
conveniently done "on the fly". Some complex recipes are broken down into 
steps.
<ul>

<li><h3>Mise En Place:</h3> &nbsp; We very much recommend "mise en place", having 
everything completely prepared, measured and ready at hand before starting to 
cook. This is particularly critical with Asian recipes where the cooking may 
last only a minute or few and you won't have time to do anything else at all.
<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; Items in this section can usually be made even 
days ahead. Many, but not all, should be refrigerated if held more than a 
couple of hours. Times for "Do Ahead" item are <b>NOT</b> included in the 
"Schedule" time.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; In general the Prep section can be be done well in 
advance, hours or even the previous day in some cases.<p></p></li>

<li><h3>Run:</h3> &nbsp; In most cases the Run section is to be carried 
through from start to finish in a single pass, unless specifically noted 
otherwise. <p></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet codes:</h2> <b>v</b>=Vegetarian strict, <b>ov</b>=Ovo Lacto 
Vegetarian (contains eggs and/or dairy), 
<b>mv</b>=Easily Made Vegetarian, <b>vf</b> vegetarian but contains fish 
sauce or some other minor seafood flavoring, "don't ask, don't tell" items, 
<b>x</b>=Pagan / Christian - definitely not kosher or halal.
<p>We don't have a vegan designation because we don't want to get tangled in 
moral hair-splitting as to exactly what qualifies as vegan. In general, a 
great many <b>v</b> recipes are or can be made vegan. Similarly we don't 
designate what is kosher or halal, just what we know for sure isn't.</p>
  
<h2>Chili codes:</h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>0</b>=none, <b>1</b>=very mild, 
<b>2</b>=mild, <b>3</b>=a bit spicy, <b>4</b>=very spicy, 
<b>5</b>=incendiary, <b>+</b>=feel free to make it hotter. All hotness 
levels based on <u>Southern California practice</u> - folks from the 
Frozen North (anything north of Sacramento) should use their own best 
judgement.

<p>In some cases (mostly heirloom Southeast Asian recipes) the spiciness 
comes from black pepper and ginger rather than chilis but we rate it the 
same.</p>

<p>Chili tolerance comes from exposure. Chili hotness is not real but exploits 
a specific nerve receptor (birds lack this receptor so don't find chilis hot). 
With exposure, this receptor is partially deactivated so persons accustomed to 
chilis can enjoy lots of them without suffering - and the "after burn" effect 
goes away entirely.</p>

<p>For these reasons you must <u>use your own best judgement</u> as to how 
sensitive you and those you cook for are. For mixed groups go light and 
serve fiery sauces and condiments on the side.</p>

<h3>Cooking Terms:</h3> &nbsp; Definitions as used on this site.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Simmer</b></a> &nbsp; On this site "Simmer" means a "Fast Simmer", 
    identical to a very slow boil. "Slow Simmer" approximates the classical 
    simmer where the liquid moves around, but no bubbles break the surface.
    </li>
  <li><b>Stir Fry:</b> &nbsp; We use this term in titles, but use 
    "Fry Stirring" in instructions, as "Stir Fry" in Cantonese restaurants 
    can not be imitated on our home stoves. We want to avoid argument 
    as to exactly what constitutes "Stir Fry".</li>
  <li><b>Saut&eacute;:</b> &nbsp; We use this word mostly in titles and 
    "Fry stirring" in instructions. There is considerable variation among 
    recipe writers as to what "saut&eacute;" means.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Service:</h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; Recipes on this site reflect current 
Euro/American practice of relatively few dishes served in separate 
courses. There are two modes of table service, and buffet service.
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Russian Service:</h3> &nbsp; The courses are brought to the table 
    already portioned onto plates or in bowls, all as individual servings. 
    For home use, the dishes are in individual servings, but there may be 
    so few courses they are all set on the table at once, such as main dish 
    and salad.</li>
  <li><h3>European Service:</h3> &nbsp; (U.S. "Family Style") &nbsp; The 
    dishes  are brought to the table all at once, on platters or in tureens 
    or casseroles, and portioned to plates and bowls at the table.</li>
  <li><b>Buffet Service:</b> &nbsp;  Everything is out on the side board 
    for guests to partake of as they please. Note that if there are many 
    dishes available, portions taken will tend to be much smaller than for 
    table service, so a recipe will serve more people.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Asian Service:</h2> &nbsp; Throughout Asia, the main dish is rice, 
bread, or noodles (depending on region). Everything else is a side dish to 
these. There will be any number of sides and everything is served at once - 
no courses. We presume most readers of this site will use our Asian recipes 
in a more Euro/American style, with larger portions of fewer dishes, and 
with the rice, noodles or bread as an accompaniment.

<p>The Western mode is becoming more prevalent throughout Asia under the 
pressures of "Modernization", "Westernization" and the disappearance of 
affordable servants. The more formal traditional service is now often 
reserved for special occasions.</p>
