This salad (or appetizer) is very popular in Puerto Rico and among Puerto 
Ricans in North America. It deserves to be better known among non-Puerto 
Ricans. Of course, it's variously made.

  <b><u>MAKE</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 minutes (30 min work))
  <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>GIZZARDS</b> as needed and cut apart the two lobes. Cut each 
    lobe in half crosswise.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Gizzards</b> in a sauce pan. Bring just to a boil, then cover 
    and simmer slowly for about 2-1/4 hours or until tender. Drain and let 
    cool.</li>
  <li>Peel Bananas. Put in a pot with plenty of salted water and bring 
    to a boil. Set to a simmer until tender to the center. The best way 
    to judge this is to pull one out, cut a 1/4 inch slice out of the 
    middle, and eat it. <u>Do not overcook</u>. Drain and let cool.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Gizzards</b> and <b>Plantains</b> into <b>Marinade</b>. Let 
    them marinate overnight or so in the fridge, turning now and then. I 
    just seal them in a plastic bag with the air squeezed, out so I can 
    just turn the bag now and then.</li>
  <li>Let it warm until just cool before serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Gizzards:</h3> &nbsp; Look for these in markets serving 
  ethnic communities (just about any eth except North Americans). As 
  sold here in California they are peeled, cleaned and ready to cook. 
  Some recipes call for "scraping off the hard green and yellow stuff",  
  usually unnecessary here, though some fragments of the tough green 
  inner lining may adhere. It is easy to peel off.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Bananas:</h3> &nbsp; I use the now common Thai Bananas, which 
  are of simmilar size to those used in Puerto Rico. They are shipped 
  quite green. Caution: if they are solid green they won't cook tender 
  in over an hour of simmering and have inferior taste. They sould have 
  a reasonable amount of yellow up to just a little green tinge. They 
  can ripen quickly, so watch them. Other cooking banans such as 
  Plantains can be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; If you think Extra Virgin will be too strong, 
  you can cut it about 1/3 with Pure Olive Oil (sometimes labeled just 
  "Olive Oil").</li>
