An essential Caribbean seasoning - but there is simply no "right" recipe 
for this. It differs from island to island and from household to 
household. The recipe given here was compiled from a number of Trinidad 
sources, none agreeing with any other.

  <p><b><u>Note:</u></b> &nbsp; all herb measures are after chopping 
  small and fairly firmly packed. Remove tough stems before chopping, 
  but tender stem tips can be used. This recipe is very green - versions 
  with a lot of onion will be less green. Commercially bottled versions 
  will be much more liquid.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Chop <b>All Ingredients</b> small (except salt and vinegar).</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Ingredients</b> together and run in a food processor 
    or blender until as smooth as you want it. Add a bit of water if you 
    want it more liquid.</li>
  <li>Refrigerated this will keep for a week or so. For longer storage, 
    freeze.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Celery:</b> &nbsp; Use a medium size stick and include the leaves 
  if at all possible.</li>
<li id="02"><b>Culantro:</b>  &nbsp; An herb related to Cilantro 
  but not at all resembling it, having long, saw toothed leaves. The 
  flavor is different, but in the same ballpark, so use Cilantro if 
  you don't have it. Culantro is available in markets serving a Southeast 
  Asian community, often labeled Ngo gai. It can also be found in some 
  markets serving a Latino community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a>  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Chili Habanero:</b> &nbsp; Nobody here in California can tell the 
  a Habanero from a Scotch Bonnet, and it doesn't matter anyway because 
  only Orange Habaneros are much available. so use either. Recipes range 
  from 1/4 of one chili to 4 or 5 whole ones. You probably want to be 
  conservative on your first try - 1/2 chili makes this recipe quite 
  noticeably hot, but you generally won't be using a lot of it in a 
  recipe. Weaker chilis don't have the distinctive fruity flavor. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Other Herbs:</b> &nbsp; As mentioned above, there is no "right" 
  recipe so use whatever herbs you want, including chives, sage, basil, 
  tarragon (judiciously), etc.</li>
