A condiment on every table in Puerto Rico, ready to be sprinkled on anything 
needing a bit of perking up. Also a great dip. This recipe makes it medium 
hot, tasty, and not too acidic. See also <a href="rjv_pique1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <ol>
  <li>If not on hand, bring 1-1/2 cups <b>WATER</b> to a boil and let cool. 
  <li>Cut fresh <b>PINEAPPLE</b> into pieces that will fit into the bottle. 
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and crack just a little. Stem <b>CHILIS</b> and 
    cut lengthwise almost to the cap.</li>
  <li>In a sterile 750mm bottle, place all <b>Bottle items</b>.</li>
  <li>Pour in cooled <b>Water</b>, leaving enough room at the top for the 
    <b>Olive Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Olive Oil</b> into the bottle to seal the contents from mold. 
    </li>
  <li>Cap the bottle and set aside at room temperature for up to 7 days, 
    then refrigerate (if there's any left by then). It will keep for months 
    provided the Olive Oil covers the top of the liquid.</li>
  <li>Serving: I pour some into a measuring cup, then decant the Olive Oil 
    on top back into the bottle. The liquid is then presented at table in a 
    cruet, containing a red chili for decoration. It will still have some 
    Olive Oil on top, which is not a problem. Additional Olive Oil can be 
    added to the bottle as needed to keep the contents covered.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pineapple:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Pineapple pieces or cores (use more) are 
  used. Other firm fruit can be used, such as papaya, avocado, sour orange, 
  tamarind, mango, or guava.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Hot:</h3> &nbsp; In Puerto Rico, tiny red Bird Chilis (Aj&iacute; 
  Caballero or Jamaican Bird Pepper) or Habaneros are often used. A mix of 
  very hot and not-so-hot Chilis is often used. In North America,  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiy.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> are most used - 
  not as hot as Jamaican Bird Peppers or Habaneros, hotter than Aji 
  Caballero. You can use red or green, or a mix of the two.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Culantro:</h3> &nbsp; [Sawtooth Herb; Recao (Puerto Rico)] &nbsp; 
  Popular in the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. Here in Los 
  Angeles, this herb is easiest to find in the large Asian markets. If you 
  can't get it, use Cilantro leaves and tender stems, but about twice as much.  
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes for Pique vary in the extreme. The rule 
  is: it is vinegar infused with chili peppers, herbs, spices, and often fruit. 
  Other ingredients often used are Lime Juice, Rum, Tequila, Sugar, Onion, 
  and Bay Leaves. The chilis may vary from moderately hot to extremely hot, 
  or a mix of very hot and not-so-hot. Some use only Vinegar, no water, and 
  then usually skip the Olive Oil seal. All vinegar is very tart, while this 
  recipe is almost "sipping quality". The amount of included ingredients 
  may be sparse, as in the photo, or almost packed, depending on hotness of 
  Chilis, hotness desired, and other ingredients. In the home, it is commonly 
  made up in empty liquor bottles.</li>
