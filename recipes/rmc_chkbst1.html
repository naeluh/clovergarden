<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hrs &nbsp; + marinate 2+ hrs to 
  overnight in the fridge)
<ol>
  <li>Remove <b>CHICKEN</b> skin. Cut into about 1-1/2 inch chunks (or 
    see <a href="rmc_chkbst1.html#02"><b>Chicken</b></a>). In Jamaica they always wash the 
    Chicken with Lime Juice, so you can do that if you wish.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>. Tumble with Chicken until it is well 
    coated.
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into chicken. Set aside to 
    marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Allspice Berries</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Cut slices into threads, and chop 
    threads fine. Mix with Onions.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into thin strips and slice to less than 1/4 
    inch. Mix with Onions.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILI</b>. Slice in half lengthwise and remove seed mass. 
    Chop fine. Add to Onions.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> crosswise very thin, white and green. Mix with 
    Onions.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
<ol start="9">
  <li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> from the Marinade and wipe off as much 
    Marinade as you reasonably can. <u>Reserve all Marinade</u>.</li>
  <li>Heat 1/4 c <b>Oil</b> in a heavy bottomed saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) 
    or equivalent. Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry over high heat, then 
    turning down a bit as fond starts to adhere to the bottom of the pan. 
    stir often and scrape the bottom of the pan. When the reddish fond 
    sticking to the bottom of the pan starts to turn chocolate, turn off the 
    heat and go to the  next step.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> from the pan leaving as much oil as you can in 
    the pan. Put chicken in a bowl to drain.</li> 
  <li>Pour out excess <b>Oil</b> leaving at most 2 Tablespoons.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Water</b> to the pan. Bring to a boil while scraping up all the 
    fond adhering to the pan.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Carrots</b>, all <b>Flavoring items</b>, and <b>Marinade</b> to 
    the pan and mix well. Then return <b>Chicken</b>, leaving behind any 
    drained oil. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for 30 minutes or until 
    Chicken is tender.</li>
  <li>Uncover and check liquid. If there isn't enough liquid, add some and 
    bring back briefly to a boil. Keep in mind, there's going to be a lot 
    less liquid when served than it looks like there is when boiling. Serving 
    with rice you want enough liquid to lightly flavor the rice.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless thigh or leg meat 
  (best for buffet service). If I don't need to make stock, I buy skinless 
  boneless thigh/leg meat. If I need stock, I buy bone-in skin-on thighs 
  and use skins, bones and trimmings to make stock. The recipe can also be 
  made with skinless bone in joints, but up the weight to about 2-1/2 pounds.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Browning Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential pantry item in the 
  Jamaican household - easily made by our recipe <a href="ris_brown1.html"> 
  <b>Browning Sauce</b></a>. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: the 1 tablespoon is for 
  our Browning Sauces. Commercial is more concentrated, so use 1/2 
  Tablespoon.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Scotch Bonnet Chili:</h3> &nbsp; These are not much available any 
  distance from the Caribbean. I use the Orange Habanero that's so common 
  in Southern California. It's the same hotness, and only a Jamaican can 
  tell the difference in flavor. If you are very chili sensitive, use half 
  of one. Other very hot Chilis can also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Use any bottled Chili Sauce that meets your 
  preference.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chicken Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This, and similar seasonings are heavily 
  used throughout the Tropical World. Ground up Bouillon Cubes could also 
  be used. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html">
  <b>Chicken Powder</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>All Purpose Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; This is another essential pantry 
  item in the Jamaican household. It is very easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="ris_allpp1.html"><b>All Purpose Seasoning</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07"> 
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Long grain rice is dominant in the Caribbean, as that 
  type can be grown in the Tropics. Jamaica imports this type from 
  Guyana and Suriname. Thai Jasmine will also work fine.</li>
