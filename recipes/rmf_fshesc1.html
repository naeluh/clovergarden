In Jamaica, this dish is usually made with whole fish, impressive, but not so 
practical. This fillet version can be presented as a table or buffet 
serving, or appetizer salad. Outstanding in any way.

  <li>Grind <b>ALLSPICE</b>. Add to Onions along with <b>THYME</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a large skillet or saute&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over 
    moderately high heat.</li>
  <li>Dust <b>FISH</b> lightly with flour just before frying. Fry on both 
    sides just until cooked through. Do not overcook. Set aside to drain.
    </li>
  <li>Pour out <b>Oil</b>, wipe out the flour with paper towels, and put in 
    1-1/2 Tablespoons of fresh oil.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b>. Pour in <b>Escovitch mix</b> and fry stirring 
    just until the strips are lightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in Vinegar and bring back to a boil for about 1 minute - do 
    not overcook.</li>
  <li>Immediately pour <b>Escovitch</b> into a bowl to cool and stop 
    cooking. Once it's cooled some, you can pour it over the fish, or hold 
    it to pour over the fish (even a day or two) later - but be sure to stir 
    it up well before pouring </li>
  <li>Once the Escovitch is poured over the fish, let it stand for at least 
    a few hours at room temperature before serving. The vinegar will prevent 
    spoilage, but if leaving it overnight I would use the fridge - but let 
    it warm to room temperature before serving.</li>
  <li>Serve at room temperature - fish on a plate with Escovitch spooned 
    over. For buffet service, after frying cut the fillets into largish bite 
    size pieces and cut the vegies a little shorter. Serve fish well mixed 
    with the Vegies to make it less likely some yoyo will pick out all the 
    fish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; In Jamaica whole fish is almost always used. I use 
  fillets as they are most adaptable to either table (whole) or buffet (cut 
  into large chunks). Whole fish make a fine display, but are much more 
  a hassle to serve and to eat.  If you use whole fish, increase to 2 pounds 
  and 1/2 cup of oil. The photo example was made with Tilapia, a fine fish 
  much maligned by chefs because it is known to be low cost. For guests I 
  usually use Golden Pompano, which is tasty, firm, and can be served 
  skin-on.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; This can be just plain Black Pepper, or a more 
  nuanced seasoning of your choice. The photo example was made with 
  Caribbean <a href="ris_allpp1.html"><b>All Purpose Seasoning</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Scotch Bonnet Chili:</h3> &nbsp; These are not much available any 
  distance from the Caribbean. I use the Orange Habanero that's so common 
  in Southern California. It's the same hotness, and only a Jamaican can 
  tell the difference in flavor. If you are very chili sensitive, use half 
  of one. Other very hot Chilis can also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Most Jamaicans use plain White Distilled Vinegar, 
  but feel free to use whatever vinegar you prefer. I have seen Apple Cider 
  Vinegar specified as well as Wine Vinegar. The photo example was made with 
  Malt Vinegar, and any of the very fine Philippine vinegars could be used.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The 1/3 cup is plenty for fillets, but for whole fish 
  use about 1/2 cup. If you have controlled your frying temperature properly, 
  a durable oil like Pure Olive or Olive Pomace can be reused for other fish 
  after filtering through a paper towel in a strainer. Corn, Soy, Vegetable, 
  and Cannola Oils should not be reused. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
