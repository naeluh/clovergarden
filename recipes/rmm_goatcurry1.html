has been adapted for the home kitchen.  For options see <a href="rmm_goatcurry1.html#04">

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (14 hrs or more, 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Debone <b>GOAT</b> and remove excess fat. Cut into 1 inch cubes  
    (See <a href="rmm_goatcurry1.html#01">Note-1</a>). Wash goat cubes in <b>Vinegar</b> 
    mixed with <b>Water</b> to cover. Drain and rinse.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop 
    <b>Chili</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Goat</b> very 
    thoroughly. Seal in a plastic bag with the air squeezed out and 
    refrigerate overnight - or at least all day if you start in the 
    morning.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Chop <b>Scallions</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Scrape as much marinade off the <b>Goat</b> as you can. Reserve 
    all of it. This is a bit tedious and some recipes skip it.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or similar heavy bottomed coverable 
    vessel heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Goat</b> until all exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and it is lightly browned on all sides. Be careful not to 
    let the fond stuck to the pan burn.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallions</b>, reserved <b>Marinade</b> and another 
    1 T <b>Curry Powder</b> (or more if desired), then <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer until Goat is tender. 
    Depending on your goat this will be at least 2-3/4 hours and more 
    likely 3-1/2 hours.</li> 
  <li>Now and then, check water, and tumble goat. When goat is nearly 
    tender taste for seasoning and adjust if needed (more curry powder, 
    chili, salt or whatever it needs).</li>
  <li>If needed, finish cooking uncovered so the sauce isn't too thin. 
    Also see Options in <a href="rmm_goatcurry1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Serve with steamed white rice, fried plantains or whatever you 
    like.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Goat Meat:</h3> &nbsp; - Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed. Removing the bones will allow the marinade to penetrate well 
  and makes serving much easier, but some Jamaicans cook it bone in, 
  sayng the flavor is better. Here in Los Angeles I often buy goat 
  as random chunks, sometimes at as low as 2012 US $1.99 / pound, but 
  more often at $2.99 / pound. These may yield up to 54% meat or as low 
  as 34% depending on how much fat, so buy plenty to get the weight of 
  meat you need. Shank end leg may be a better deal because it reliably 
  yields about 64%, but it is more expensive. Loin end leg is difficult 
  to disassemble and yields only about 38%. Bones and trimmings make 
  excellent stock for use in recipes. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ag_goat.html"><b>Goat</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Actually this should be 
  a Scotch Bonnet, but here in California we can't tell which is which 
  (Bonnys are said to be sweeter and a little flatter in shape), but 
  either will work fine. Just one will make a dish Jamaicans would 
  consider scandalously mild, but don't use more unless you know what 
  you're doing, especially if you come from the Frozen North. Yes, I do 
  use more. Note that some Jamaicans use a Scotch Bonnet based chili 
  sauce rather than the fresh peppers. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Jamaican if possible. Buy (Jamaicans 
  seem to prefer Grace brand), or make your own (see our recipe 
  <a href="rys_cpjamai1.html"><b>Jamaican Curry Powder</b></a>). 
  Quantities used in the recipe vary greatly, and the amount given here 
  is toward the low end. If you want more, put it in after frying the 
  meat.  If Jamaican powder is not possible, use Madras curry powder. 
  Much depends on the quality of the curry powder, so use a top brand 
  (Ship, Sun).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; Some suggest adding about 8 
  ounces of potatoes cut into 1/2 inch cubes, or sweet potatoes (the white 
  ones) or tomatoes for the last 20 minutes or so of cooking. Adding 
  potatoes or sweet potatoes will allow the dish to serve one more person.
