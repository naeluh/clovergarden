This excellent recipe is unusual because it is one of only a few Dominican 
recipes that use hot chilis. It is clearly related to Jamaican 
<a href="rmm_goatcurry1.html"><b>Curry Goat</b></a>, but with more 
vegetables, little heat and no heavy spicing.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 hrs or more, 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Debone <b>GOAT</b> and remove excess fat. Cut into 1 inch cubes  
    (See <a href="rmm_goatdom1.html#01">Note-1</a>). Wash goat cubes in <b>Vinegar</b> 
    mixed with <b>Water</b> to cover. Drain and rinse.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Dice 
    <b>CUBANELLE</b> tiny, Dice <b>CELERY</b> tiny. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Goat</b> very 
    thoroughly. Seal in a plastic bag with the air squeezed out and 
    refrigerate overnight - or at least all day if you start in the 
    morning. Actually, I usually do this part the evening before the 
    evening I'll cook it, so my refrigerated marinade is about 24 hours.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Scrape as much marinade off the <b>Goat</b> as you can. Reserve 
    all of it. This is a bit tedious, but that's how it's done..</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or similar heavy bottomed coverable 
    vessel heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Goat</b> until all exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and it is lightly browned on all sides, being careful the 
    fond that sticks to the pan doesn't burn.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1-1/2 cup Water, bring to a boil, cover and simmer until Goat 
    is tender (2-3/4 to 3-1/2 hours, depending how ornery your goat was). 
    Tumble the Goat now and then and add water if needed.</li> 
  <li>Meanwhile:  Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and cut into chunks (about 8 chunks 
    for an Italian plum tomato). Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop 
    <b>HABANERO</b> fine.</li> 
  <li>Mix together all <b>Finish items</b> together with the reserved 
    marinade.</li>
  <li>When <b>Goat</b> is tender, stir in <b>Marinade mix</b>. Bring back 
    to a boil, check liquid and simmer covered for another 20 to 30 
    minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed long grain rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Goat Meat:</h3> &nbsp; - Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed. Removing the bones will allow the marinade to penetrate well 
  and makes serving much easier, but some Jamaicans cook it bone in, 
  sayng the flavor is better. Here in Los Angeles I often buy goat 
  as random chunks, sometimes at as low as 2012 US $1.99 / pound, but 
  more often at $2.99 / pound. These may yield up to 54% meat or as low 
  as 34% depending on how much fat, so buy plenty to get the weight of 
  meat you need. Shank end leg may be a better deal because it reliably 
  yields about 64%, but it is more expensive. Loin end leg is difficult 
  to disassemble and yields only about 38%. Bones and trimmings make 
  excellent stock for use in recipes. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ag_goat.html"><b>Goat</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cubanelle Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Also called Italian Frying Pepper, 
  this is a yellow-green, thin walled chili that looks a lot like a 
  banana pepper, but has very little to no heat. Most are imported from 
  the Dominican Republic and we don't have them here in California. Best 
  substitute is heatless Hungarian or Armenian / Turkish chilis, but 
  those may be erratically available. Next best is the green Anaheim 
  pepper which is always available. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Actually this should be a Scotch 
  Bonnet, but here in California we can't tell which is which (Bonnys 
  are said to be sweeter and a little flatter in shape), but either will 
  work fine. Just one will make a dish with just noticeable bite, and 
  since Dominicans aren't into hot, that's probably enough for them - 
  but not for me. Note that some Dominicans use a Scotch Bonnet based 
  chili sauce rather than the fresh peppers. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.
