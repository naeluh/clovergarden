Often called "Pig Tails with Peas" in Jamaica, (probably originally made 
with pigeon peas), this flavorful dish has an interesting mix of 
textures. The pig tails themselves are "finger food".

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-3/4 hrs + bean soaking time)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>KIDNEY BEANS</b> 8 hours or overnight in water with 1/2 T 
    salt. Simmer them in water to cover for however long it takes to make 
    them tender (maybe 1-1/2 hours unless beans are old) - check 
    frequently).</li>
  <li>Brown the <b>PIG TAILS</b> moderately. I suggest coating them with 
    oil and browning in the broiler or on the grill rather than in a pan 
    with oil, because pig skin splatters oil rather explosively, which 
    results in a mess and possibly serious burns.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Pig Tails</b> in a pot with water to cover well, bring to 
    a boil and simmer until pig tails are tender, about 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 
    hours depending on how tender you want them </li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine and toss in with the tomatoes.</li>
  <li>When <b>Pig Tails</b> are done: &nbsp;  Drain them and cut them into 
    the size pieces you want. I suggest about 2-1/2 to 3 inches.</li>
  <li>In a large saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate heat and 
    fry <b>Onion mix</b> until onions are translucent but not at all 
    browned, then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Chili</b> and <b>Thyme</b>. 
    Fry stirring until tomatoes are cooked down and the oil starts to 
    separate.</li> 
  <li>Stir in cooked <b>Kidney Beans</b> and 1 cup of <b>Water</b> until 
    well distributed. Cover and simmer for about 10 minutes stirring once or 
    twice.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Fold in 
    <b>Pig Tails</b> and simmer until heated well through.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed rice (California or Jasmine). Provide a 
    bone bowl for the discards and plenty of paper napkins.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Tails:</h3> &nbsp; These are available from various ethnic 
  markets, particularly those serving a Southeast Asian community. For 
  details, see our <a href="../ingred/ap_tailz.html">
  <b>Pig Tails</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kidney Beans:</h3> &nbsp; The 1 cup measure is for dry kidney 
  beans before soaking, You could also use canned kidney beans to save 
  a lot of prep time. You want 1 pound of drained beans.</li>
<li  id="03">
  <h3>Chili Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Nobody here in California 
  can tell the difference between a Habanero and a Scotch Bonnet, so use 
  either. The amount is highly variable. 1/2 Habanero produces barely 
  noticeable heat, which would be scandalous in the Caribbean. Feel free 
  to use more depending on your tolerance. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.
