day) See <a href="rom_joumo1.html#09"><b>Comments</b></a> and <a href="rom_joumo1.html#10">

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - can be done days in advance)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the <a href="riv_epis1.html"><b>Epis</b></a>. This will make 
    Day-1 easy.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Day-1 - Meat &amp; Marinade</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + 8 hrs rest)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 3/4 inch chunks. Wash well in warm water, 
    then drain well.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>. Massage into Beef thoroughly. Set aside 
    for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add 1 cup of <b>Epis</b> to the meat and massage it in.</li>
  <li>Cover <b>Meat</b> with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Day-1 or 2 - Pasta</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 5 min work)
    <ol start="6">
  <li>Bring some salted Water to a boil and cook <b>Pasta</b> until just 
    done. Drain and tumble with a dash of oil so it won't stick together. 
    If using two different Pastas, cook them separately because they won't 
    cook in the same time, but mix them when they are done. It's OK to do 
    this a day ahead and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Day-2 - Squash</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min + 50 min cook &amp; cool)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Peel <b>KABOCHA</b> (not strictly necessary), and cut it in half top 
    to bottom. A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is the safest way. Scoop out all seeds and fibers. Set on your cutting 
    board cut side down and cut into about 1 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Kabocha chunks</b> in a saucepan with all other <b>Squash 
    items</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes or until 
    well cooked.</li>
  <li>Let <b>Kabocha</b> cool enough for safe handling, then pur&eacute;e 
    it, including the water it was cooked in. Use a Mixie, Food Processor, 
    or Immersion Blender.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Day-2 - Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Peel <b>MALANGA</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch cubes.  Peel 
    <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch cubes. Mix and Hold in cool 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice about 1/8 inch thick.  Peel <b>TURNIP</b> 
    and cut into about 1/4 inch dice. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut top off <b>HABANERO</b> and slice in half lengthwise remove just 
    the seed core - OR just slice it in half if you want noticeable heat.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> into quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Slice <b>LEEK</b> fine, white and light green parts only. Chop 
    <b>CELERY</b> fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CABBAGE</b> into narrow wedges, cut out core and shred fine.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Clean up time.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs)
  <ol start="17">
  <li>Bring <b>Beef</b> out of the fridge early, and let it come to room 
    temperature.</li>
  <li>Drain liquid from <b>Beef</b>, retaining liquid.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar heavy bottomed 
    coverable vessel heat 3 T <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Beef</b>, stirring 
    increasingly often, until all exuded liquid has evaporated and it is 
    showing signs of browning. Be careful fond that sticks to the pan 
    doesn't burn (this will be about 25 minutes).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>reserved liquid</b> and 2 cup <b>Water</b>, bring to a boil, 
    cover and simmer, tumbling now and then, until Beef is tender but not 
    falling apart (about 1-1/2 hour). Stir in boiling water if getting too 
    dry.</li> 
  <li>In a coverable Saut&eacute; pan, Dutch Oven, or tri-ply Stew Pot (5 qt
    minimum), heat 2 T Oil and stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Onions are translucent.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Kabocha Pur&eacute;e</b>. Drain and stir in <b>Malanga 
    mix</b>, <b>Carrot mix</b>, 2/3 cup <b>Epis</b>, and the <b>Beef</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, adding boiling <b>Water</b> if it seems too thick. 
    Cover, and turn to a simmer until all ingredients are suitably cooked.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cabbage</b> and simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in Lime Juice.</li>
  <li>If not serving all at once, scoop out as much as you will serve now. 
    Stir in a portion of the <b>Pasta</b> suitable for that amount. Bring 
    to a simmer for a couple of minutes and take off the heat.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot. It can be a one dish meal, with perhaps a salad on the side.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat removed. 
  Shoulder is best, but any stewing cut will be fine. Goat is considered an 
  acceptable substitute for Beef in Haiti, but here in California it's way 
  more expensive than Beef.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Epis Seasoning:</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential base or seasoning 
  for Hatian cuisines. It is not hard to make, and can be made several days 
  in advance. See our recipe <a href="riv_epis1.html"><b>Epis</b></a>. 
  This recipe takes the whole Epis recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, this soup is made with two Pastas: 
  typically Penne or Rigatoni, and Spaghetti. This is flexible as to exactly 
  what. Spaghetti or other long pastas should be broken to about 1-1/2 inch 
  lengths. I have the Pasta cooked separately from the soup for good reason. 
  This is a big recipe, and If any or all the soup will be reheated, portion 
  the Pasta for the amount that's being served and add the Pasta just a couple 
  of minutes before serving. That way you will avoid swollen, overcooked 
  Pasta in the Soup.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kabocha:</h3> &nbsp; Reliable pattern recipes call for Calabaza,  
  also known as Green Pumpkin and West Indian Pumpkin. Calabaza is not much 
  available here in Southern California, but Kabocha certainly is, and is a 
  similar winter cooking squash. One authentic recipe calls for Turban Squash, 
  but that is generally considered an inferior squash for cooking. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sq_kabochz.html"><b>Kabocha Squash</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Beef or Chicken can be used. If you don't have this 
  ready, don't worry. In Haiti it's usually made using a couple of Bouillon 
  Cubes.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Malanga:</h3> &nbsp; [New Cocoyam (West Africa)] &nbsp; Authoritative 
  recipes just about all call for Malanga. This root can be found in 
  Philippine markets, as well as other South and Southeast Asian Markets. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/am_malangz.html"><b>Malanga</b></a> 
  page. If you can't get it, increase Turnip and Potato.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Chili Habanero:</h3> &nbsp; Just one prepared as noted will make a dish 
  with just noticeable bite. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very substantial soup, fully capable 
  as a main dish soup. I have divided the recipe into discrete stages to make 
  it easier to plan and make. Try to overlap operations as much as you can to 
  minimize time, unless you have plenty of time. The Pasta is cooked 
  separately to make this soup reheatable.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Haiti's independence from France makes it the 
  only country in the world established by a successful Slave Revolt. 
  Independence was declared on 1 January 1804, upon withdrawal of Napoleon 
  Bonaparte's surviving forces on the Island. This celebration soup is 
  made primarily from ingredients the Slaves were not allowed to use before 
  independence. </li>
