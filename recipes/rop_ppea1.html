Vegetarian recipes are an alien concept to Puerto Ricans. This adaption 
of a Puerto Rican chicken soup was composed by a Puerto Rican cookbook 
writer for a Vegie friend.  See <a href="rop_ppea1.html#09"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pigeon Peas:</h3> &nbsp; [Gandules] &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  calls for a 14 ounce pack of frozen Pigeon Peas. This is pretty much 
  unavailable in Southern California, but Goya brand canned Green Pigeon 
  Peas are widely available. Dried Pigeon Peas are not suitable as they 
  were fully ripened - it's the green state we need.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kabocha Squash:</h3> &nbsp; This hard winter squash is now widely 
  available in North America, and the one to use whenever a recipe calls 
  for "Pumpkin", regardless of ethnicity. Regular orange pumpkin is for 
  Haloween, not cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sq_kabochz.html"><b>Kabocha Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis, Mild</h3> &nbsp; In Puerto Rico, Cubanelles would be used, 
  and probably a couple Aji Dulce, which they use in just about 
  everything. Cubanelles are unavailable in much of North America, but 
  low heat Hungarian or Armenian / Turkish chilis work fine. If those 
  are not available, low heat yellow banana peppers will work. As for 
  Aji Dulce, those are just plain unavailable, except probably in 
  Florida and New York, the two Puerto Rican "homelands away from home". 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Culantro:</h3> &nbsp; [Sawtooth Herb] &nbsp; This herb is available 
  in many Asian markets, or markets serving a Tropical American community. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a> page. If you 
  don't have it, use a couple tablespoons of chopped Cilantro.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; My favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, but 
  other simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; While medium grain California rice dominates in 
  the Caribbean, we strongly recommend a high amylose long grain rice, 
  such as Thai Jasmine, for this recipe. Medium grain rice absorbs water 
  endlessly, swelling, turning to a gel, and overwhelming the other 
  ingredients. This recipe was probably composed in North America 
  anyway, where long grain rices predominate.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for Chicken Broth, 
  but to be vegetarian this needs to be a vegetable stock. If you have 
  none, you can use water with 1-1/2 T Vegeta&reg; or similar. For 
  details see our recipe 
  <a href="giv_stockv1.html"><b>Vegetarian Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Do-Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe has a major problem - even 
  long grain rice will continue to absorb water and swell - overwhelming 
  the other ingredients. If you need to make ahead, cook the rice in a 
  rice cooker or pan using the correct amount of the Broth for your rice. 
  Cook the rest of the recipe in the remaining broth until the Kabocha is 
  about done. Both can be refrigerated. Reheat the soup to a boil and 
  stir in the rice. bring back to a boil. Serve immediately. 
  Incidentally, the pattern recipe called for 2 cups short grain rice, 
  and that was waaaaaay too much.  This recipe is not a candidate for 
  buffet service where it will be kept warm for hours. For that see our 
  adaption <a href="rop_ppvia1.html"><b>Green Pigeon Pea Vianda 
  Soup</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Thie pattern recipe was composed by 
  cookbook writer Yvonne Ortiz for a Vegi friend. Since she grew up 
  on the island, graduated University there, and later formally studied 
  its cuisines, I consider it "authentic", even though Puerto Ricans 
  just don't do vegetarian.</li>
