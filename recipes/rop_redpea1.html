  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min &nbsp; + 8 hours soak)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BEANS</b> with 1/2 T <b>Salt</b> 8 hours or overnight.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Put <b>beef</b> in a sauce pan with water to cover well. On high heat, 
    bring to a boil for 1 minute, then pour out into a clean sink. Rinse 
    the Beef and clean the pan.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>HAM</b> into about 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks. Hold in cool 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into about 1/4 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Slit <b>SCOTCH BONNETS</b> open.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot sufficient for the recipe (3 quart), place 
    <b>Beans</b>, <b>Meats</b> and 5 cups <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer covered until Beans are just about tender. Time will depend on age 
    of your beans, but average is about 1-1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Scallions</b>, <b>Scotch 
    Bonnets</b>, and  <b>Thyme</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 15 minutes. 
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinners</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring back to a boil and 
    simmer another 15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Spinners</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min &nbsp; + 15 minutes simmer)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b> in a bowl. Mix in water as required 
    to make a stiff dough. Form Spinners right away before gluten develops.
    </li>
  <li>Pinch off chunks about 2 Tablespoons and roll them in lightly oiled 
    hands to make torpedoes, pointed at both ends. They should be about 2 
    inches long and less than 1/2 inch diameter. They'll swell a bit in 
    cooking.</li> 
  <li>These can be added directly to soup, as long as the soup will continue 
    to simmer for at least 15 minutes, or they can be cooked ahead, stirred 
    into boiling water. Stir a couple of times right after adding them to 
    avoid sticking. Bring to a boil and simmer at least 15 minutes.</li> 
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kidney Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Dark or Medium Red are good. Kidney Beans 
  should always be <u>less than 1 year old</u> or they will not cook tender,
  even with hours of simmering.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Any stewing cut will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Ham:</h3> &nbsp; This is a variable item. Some use smoked ham, others a 
    small Ham Hock, or Pig Tails. The photo example was made with Slab Bacon, 
    because that's what I had.  Note that Jamaican recipes call for soaking 
    Pig Tails to reduce salt. That is not needed in North America because 
    Pig Tails are not sold salted here.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Scotch Bonnet Chili:</h3> &nbsp; If you are very Chili adverse, use 
  half of one. If you've paid your dues to the Chili Gods, feel free to 
  use 2. Scotch Bonnets are not much available at any distance from the 
  Caribbean. I use the Orange Habanero that's so common in Southern 
  California. It's the same hotness, and only a Jamaican can tell the 
  difference in flavor. Other very hot Chilis can also be used. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Spinners:</h3> &nbsp; These are very traditional, but less appropriate 
  for buffer service. In that case I'd either omit them, or pre-cook them 
  and slice them into 1/2 inch segments before stirring in when the soup is 
  done.</li>
