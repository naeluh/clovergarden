  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>KABOCHA</b> thinly - some light green is fine. Cut into about 
    1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Peel and core <b>APPLES</b> and cut into pieces of similar size to the 
    Pumpkin. Mix the two and keep in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>CUBANELLE</b> (or substitute) very small. 
  <li>Dice <b>MILD CHILIS</b> (or substitute) very small. &nbsp; <u>Caution:</u> If 
    you clean the seeds and membranes out of Habaneros, immediately wash 
    your hands, cutting board, knife, and anything else they have touched, 
    with a strong cleanser - and don't touch your eyes for a few hours.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot sufficient for the recipe (3 qt min), stir in 
    <b>All items</b> (except Garnish). Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 
    minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Strain out the Solids, reserving all the Liquid.</li>
  <li>Remove about 1/3 of the Solids and set aside.  Pur&eacute;e the rest 
    in a food processor, blender, or <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>
    Mixie</b></a> with as much of the reserved liquid as needed.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Pur&eacute;e</b> and the reserved <b>Solids</b> to the pot. 
    Add as much of the reserved Liquid as you think is needed and bring 
    up hot over moderate heat, stirring fairly often to prevent sticking.
    </li>
  <li>Adjust Liquid as needed and check Salt.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kabocha Squash:</h3> &nbsp; This hard winter squash is now widely 
  available in North America, and the one to use whenever a recipe calls 
  for "Pumpkin". Regular orange pumpkin is for Halloween, not cooking.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sq_kabochz.html"><b>Kabocha 
  Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Apples, Green:</h3> &nbsp; A fairly tart apple, like Granny Smith 
  is what you want.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cubanelle Chili</h3> &nbsp; [Italian Frying Pepper] &nbsp; This mild 
  Chili is not much available in Southern California, or some other regions 
  of North America, so substitutions must be made. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_cubanz.html"><b>Cubanelle Chili</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis, Mild</h3> &nbsp; [Aji Dulce] &nbsp; This chili belongs to the 
  Habanero family, and has the fruity flavor but no heat. They are popular 
  in Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, where hot 
  chilis are not much appreciated. They may be available in Florida and 
  New York, but not much elsewhere. For this recipe I use two Orange 
  Habaneros, scraping out the seeds and membranes. This still gives some 
  heat to the soup, but, this is Southern California, not Puerto Rico, and 
  here a soup without at least some chili heat is almost unthinkable. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_caribz.html"><b>Caribbean 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Chicken Broth, but 
  if you want it vegetarian, this needs to be a vegetable stock. For 
  details see our recipe <a href="giv_stockv1.html"><b>Vegetarian 
  Stock</b></a>. If you are pressed for time, you can use water with a 
  Tablespoon of Vegeta&reg;, or for non-veg a Tablespoon of Chicken Powder. 
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was adapted for Puerto Rican 
  tastes (no chili heat) from a West Indian (Caribbean) recipe that had been 
  adapted for restaurant service as a soup course (fully pur&eacute;ed). 
  My recipe is more "home style", with a lot more texture, interesting 
  enough to be a main course or lunch soup. Due to necessary adaption with 
  the Chilis (see above) it is also more "West Indian", with a little more 
  heat than favored in Puerto Rico.</li>
