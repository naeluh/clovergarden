  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 30 min work (hand grated))

  <li>Cap <b>OKRA</b> and cut crosswise into 1/3 inch segments.</li>
  <li>Lightly grease a bowl that will hold 4 cups, to use as a mold.</li>

  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan (3 qt) or similar, mix together 
    <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, stir in 
    <b>Okra</b>, then simmer for about 5 minutes or until Okra is tender.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, then start adding <b>Cornmeal</b> 
    a little at a time, stirring continuously. Add hot <b>Water</b> as needed. 
    Cook for 15 to 20 minutes over moderate heat, stirring vigorously, 
    continuously, and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the mixture is 
    firm enough to hold stiff peaks.</li>
  <li>Pour into the <b>Greased Bowl</b> and smooth the top. Let it rest for 
    a few minutes, then invert the bowl over a cutting board. Slice into 
    largish chunks and serve warm. It is soft and will be eaten with a 
    fork.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Unsweetened</u>. Coconut milk from 
  Thailand is excellent, some others are disappointing. I use Aroy-D, but 
  there are other fine brands. A good quality Coconut Milk will have lots 
  of heavy cream at the top. Check the recipe - you need to avoid shaking 
  the can before opening if it calls for scooping out the cream.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Typical of Trinidad and Jamaica, this recipe can 
  also be made as patties rather than pouring into a mold. In Jamaica it is 
  called "Turn Polenta". Some recipes are a little more complex, with 
  chopped Onions and/or Scallions - fried lightly before proceeding with the 
  recipe, and some are seasoned with <a href="ris_allpp1.html">
  <b>All Purpose Seasoning</b></a> (or similar). Every recipe I've seen 
  includes plenty of Okra.</li>
