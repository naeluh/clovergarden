Curry Powder was brought from India (see <a href="rys_cptrini1.html#03"><b>History</b></a>) 
and evolved into a unique spicing tailored to Caribbean tastes and 
ingredients. See <a href="rys_cptrini1.html#01"><b>Ingredients</b></a>.

    Do the cumin first because it's easiest to judge by smell when the pan 
    is hot enough. The pan sould never smoke.</li>
  <li>If using fresh Curry Leaves, let the pan cool quite a bit and then fry 
    them briefly to dry them out.</li>
  <li>Let <b>All Items</b> cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li> Grind <b>All items</b> together to a fine powder in a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or spice grinder.
  <li>Package in an airtight jar. Stored in a cool place away from sunlight 
    it should be good for at least 6 months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3> &nbsp; There is no standard ingredient list, 
  or measures, so Trinidad Curry Powders vary, but this recipe is 
  typical.
<li id="02">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are best fresh and are now (2022) 
  available in Indian markets and some Southeast Asian markets. If you don't 
  have them, you have to leave them out - there is no acceptable substitute. 
  For details see our  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Curry Powder was brought to the Caribbean from 
  India, by near-slave workers after abolition of slavery. Africans were 
  previously brought to Trinidad and Guyana as slaves. Trinidad people are 
  35% of India descent and 8% mixed African / Indian, and In Guyana, 44% of 
  the people are of India descent and about 17% mixed African / Indian. 
  Given these demographics, you can see why Curries became so widespread in 
  the region. Trinidad and Guyana have a very close association.</li>
