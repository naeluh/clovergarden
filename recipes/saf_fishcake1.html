Delicious and popular. Experts say these cakes only come out right if 
made from the Featherback fish. Any other fish, not so good - but given 
the scarcity of Featherbacks in Des Moines, you might want to check out

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>First catch your <b>FEATHERBACK FISH</b> (see <a href="saf_fishcake1.html#01">Note-1</a>) 
    and scrape it for paste.</li>
  <li>Make the <b>CUCUMBER SAUCE</b> (see <a href="saf_fishcake1.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  <li>Very thoroughly mush together the <b>Fish Paste</b>, <b>Egg</b> 
    and <b>Red Curry Paste</b> until completely blended, uniform and 
    very sticky. Mush it with your hands (which can take a while) or use 
    a stand mixer with paddle blade (see <a href="saf_fishcake1.html#08">Note-8</a>).</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>KAFFIR LEAVES</b> very tight and slice into fine threads. 
    Discard the stems and cut the threads into shorter pieces. Cut the 
    <b>LONG BEANS</b> thin crosswise. Work both into the fish paste until 
    evenly distributed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or deep skillet heat <b>Oil</b> for deep frying to 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. (see <a href="saf_fishcake1.html#06">Note-6</a>).</li>
  <li>With very wet hands form a few small pancakes from the fish paste, 
    about 3/8 inch thick and about 2 inches across (see <a href="saf_fishcake1.html#06">
    Note-6</a>).
  <li>Slide them a few at a time into the oil and fry turning several times  
    until lightly browned. They are done when they float high, the oil 
    starts sizzle more, and they are very elastic when tapped. Scoop them 
    out and drain on paper towels.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with plenty of Cucumber Sauce. 
    I find cutting them into slices for serving works quite well too (see 
    <a href="saf_fishcake1x.html">Photos</a>).</li> 
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Featherback Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The best way to catch this fish is 
  as a frozen block of Featherback Fish Paste found in the freezer chests 
  of a market serving a Southeast Asian community. It is otherwise a 
  rather tedious fish to deal with. Weight is for scraped paste. For 
  details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fbackz.html"><b>Featherback</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most 
  important Thai curry paste. It can be bought, but is much better made 
  at home. Here's our recipe, 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. The 1-1/2 T 
  will still be pretty mild, even using our recipe, so vary as you may 
  desire.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are quite common now, but yes you 
  can use regular round green beans, but maybe bump up to 2/3 cup. Long 
  beans, of Asian origin, have a darker, sweeter flavor than green beans, 
  which are of American origin.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; These come two to a stem, so for this 
  recipe you'll need two stems. They are becoming more available both 
  fresh and frozen in markets serving Southeast Asian communities. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html">
  <b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cucumber Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce is considered essential with 
  fish cakes. See our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_cukesauce1.html"><b>Cucumber Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Technique:</h3> &nbsp; These methods have made the job much easier 
  for me.
  <ul>
  <li><u>Mixing</u>: &nbsp; I've seen times given from 5 minutes to 25 
    minutes by hand or 10 minutes by paddle mixer. More seems better so I 
    use a stand mixer about 8 minutes with the paddle attachment. The result 
    should be viscous, sticky and with a shiny appearance.</li>
  <li><u>Forming</u>: &nbsp; I've found a base coat of oil on my hands before 
    applying water is very helpful. Just massage an oil saturated paper towel, 
    then a few seconds under running water.</li>
  <li><u>Forming</u>: &nbsp; I lay out a sheet of parchment paper and oil 
    it well. When I've formed a cake I shake it off my hand onto the paper 
    and poke into shape.</li>
  <li><u>Transferring</u> to oil. When the oil is up to temperature I use a 
    thin, clean, dry stainless slotted turner. I dip it in the hot oil and 
    then pick up cakes off the oiled paper and slip them into the oil. I 
    then use a wooden turner to poke them around (the metal turner would 
    become difficult to clean). Turning them over several times works best. 
    I lift them out with a deep fry strainer and drain on paper towels. I 
    then clean and dry the metal turner for the next batch,</li>
  <li><u>Oil</u>: &nbsp; I use Olive Pomace, a very high temperature oil with 
    no olive flavor. Originally these were probably made in lard, which is 
    lower temperature but very fine indeed, but the AHA has scared people 
    from using it, though it's far less dangerous than the trans fats they 
    told us to use instead. Actually, its health profile is better than 
    butter. For details see our 
    <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html">Lard</a> page.</li>
  <li><u>Frying</u>: &nbsp; I find 1-1/2 inches of oil in the bottom of my 
    kadhai is fine for 5 cakes at a time and that depth should be good for 
    a wok as well. A skillet may get by with an inch, but that will still 
    take more oil. I turn the heat off when I have removed a batch and don't 
    turn it back on until the next batch is formed, but it takes only a couple 
    minutes to get back to temperature.</li>
  <li><u>Texture</u>: &nbsp; The cakes should be firm and quite elastic, a 
    characteristic of Featherback. Other fish may produce cakes that are 
    mushy or flaky.</li>
  </ul></li>
