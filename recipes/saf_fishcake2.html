In Thailand the proper and acceptable fish for fish cakes is Featherback, 
but this recipe, written by a Laotian refugee in Hawaii, is a little more 
tolerant - and figures you don't have featherbacks.

If you do have Featherbacks (or Featherback Paste), see  
<a href="saf_fishcake1.html"><b>Fish Cakes #1</b></a>. You still need

we're not going to be <u>that</u> tolerant.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>FISH</b> fine, but not food processor fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEANS</b> thin crosswise. Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Seed 
    <b>CHILIS</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> fine. Mix all with 
    <b>Fish</b>.</li> 
  <li>Peel tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. Smash the bottom 5 inches with your kitchen mallet and 
    slice crosswise as thin as you can get it. Chop fine and mix with 
    <b>Fish</b>. I usually pound it in my big granite mortar after 
    chopping to soften it up.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Eggs</b>, <b>Cornstarch</b> and 
    <b>Sugar</b> into <b>Fish</b>. Mix thoroughly (see below).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a kadhai, wok or deep skillet heat <b>Oil</b> for deep frying to 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. (see <a href="saf_fishcake2.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>With very wet hands form a few small pancakes from the fish paste, 
    about 1/4 inch thick and about 2 inches across (see <a href="saf_fishcake2.html#06">
    <b>Note-6</b></a>).
  <li>Slide them a few at a time into the oil and fry turning several 
    times until lightly browned. They are done when they float high and 
    are elastic when tapped. Scoop them out and drain on paper towels.
    </li> 
  <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with plenty of Cucumber Sauce. 
    I find cutting them into wide slices for serving works quite well 
    too.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; While the unique texture of Featherback makes 
  it the essential fish cake fish in Thailand, your local supermarket 
  is highly unlikely to stock that fish. This recipe works with any fish 
  that's a bit bland and not too firm. I used this recipe for a farm 
  raised steelhead, the flesh of which was bland and almost paste-like, 
  perfect for fish cakes and worthless for anything else. The cakes had 
  a bit of a salmon flavor, but that isn't necessarily bad. If you're 
  curious about Featherbacks, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fbackz.html"><b>Featherback</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are thinner and have a much darker, 
  sweeter flavor than the common green beans - they are most like fresh 
  young blackeye pea pods. Long Beans are very available in Southern 
  California, but I'm not sure about other regions. Use round green 
  beans chopped small if you can't get them, but increase the quantity 
  just a little. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> Around here we all use Fresnos, but Holland Red 
  or other medium hot chili will do fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cucumber Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce is considered essential 
  with fish cakes. For a recipe see our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_cukesauce1.html"><b>Cucumber Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Technique:</h3> &nbsp; These methods have made the job much 
  easier for me.
  <ul>
  <li><u>Mixing</u>: &nbsp; I've seen times given from 5 minutes to 25 
    minutes by hand or 10 minutes by paddle mixer. More seems better so I 
    use a stand mixer about 8 minutes with the paddle attachment. The result 
    should be viscous, sticky and with a shiny appearance.</li>
  <li><u>Forming</u>: &nbsp; I've found a base coat of oil on my hands before 
    applying water is very helpful. Just massage an oil saturated paper towel, 
    then a few seconds under running water.</li>
  <li><u>Forming</u>: &nbsp; I lay out a sheet of parchment paper and oil 
    it well. When I've formed a cake I shake it off my hand onto the paper 
    and poke into shape.</li>
  <li><u>Transferring</u> to oil. When the oil is up to temperature I use a 
    thin, clean, dry stainless slotted turner. I dip it in the hot oil and 
    then pick up cakes off the oiled paper and slip them into the oil. I 
    then use a wooden turner to poke them around (the metal turner would 
    become difficult to clean). Turning them over several times works best. 
    I lift them out with a deep fry strainer and drain on paper towels. I 
    then clean and dry the metal turner for the next batch,</li>
  <li><u>Oil</u>: &nbsp; I use Olive Pomace, a very high temperature oil with 
    no olive flavor. Originally these were probably made in lard, which is 
    lower temperature but very fine indeed, but the AHA has scared people 
    from using it, though it's far less dangerous than the trans fats they 
    told us to use instead. Actually, its health profile is better than 
    butter. For details see our 
    <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html">Lard</a> page.</li>
  <li><u>Frying</u>: &nbsp; I find 1-1/2 inches of oil in the bottom of my 
    kadhai is fine for 5 cakes at a time and that depth should be good for 
    a wok as well. A skillet may get by with an inch, but that will still 
    take more oil. I turn the heat off when I have removed a batch and don't 
    turn it back on until the next batch is formed, but it takes only a couple 
    minutes to get back to temperature.</li>
  <li><u>Texture</u>: &nbsp; The cakes should be firm and somewhat elastic, 
    not as elastic as featherback, but definitely not mushy or flaky.</li>
    </ul>
