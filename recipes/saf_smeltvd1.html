These simple fried smelts with dip are a fine appetizer for people who 
like fish. It can also be used for tiny fish other than smelts. How long 
the recipe takes depends on several factors (see <a href="saf_smeltvd1.html#05">
<b>Note-5</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (15 to 45 min - see <a href="saf_smeltvd1.html#05">
  <b>Note-5</b></a>)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>SMELTS</b> as desired (see 
    <a href="saf_smeltvd1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Dry them on paper towels if needed. 
    </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Rice Flour</b> with <b>Salt</b>. I usually run the salt to 
    powder in a spice grinder so it blends better with the flour.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> fine. Place 
    in a mortar along with <b>Sugar</b> and pound to a paste.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mix all <b>Dip items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (about 20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Pour <b>Flour mix</b> onto a plate.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Oil</b> to a frying temperature, about 370&deg;F/190&deg;C.
    A skillet with about 1/4 inch of oil works best as it has plenty of 
    room so the smelts aren't crowded.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>Smelts</b> in <b>Flour mix</b> to coat lightly, shaking off 
    excess flour.</li> 
  <li>Working in batches so they aren't crowded, fry <b>Smelts</b> until 
    light golden (rice flour doesn't brown very dark). You will notice a 
    sudden decrease in the amount of bubbling. This indicates they are 
    about cooked through, so now you need only be concerned with color 
    and crispness. Drain on paper towels.</li> 
  <li>Serve fried <b>Smelts</b> immediately with the <b>Dip</b>. They 
    are best served warm, but they can be refreshed in a moderately 
    hot oven.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Smelts:</h3> &nbsp; You'll probably be using 
  frozen smelts as fresh are not available in most regions. Whether you 
  use them head-on and/or guts in depends on personal preference and the 
  size of the smelts. Very small ones are traditionally eaten "heads, 
  guts and feathers", but I gutted those in the photo. Large ones should 
  be gutted, but I've found the heads to be no problem even in 5-1/2 inch 
  fish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3> &nbsp; The dip given here is a Vietnamese 
  alternative to their more famous <a href="sjf_nuoccham1.html">
  <b>Nuoc Cham</b></a>, which uses fish sauce instead of soy sauce. 
  Either will work fine. This recipe makes enough dip for at least 2 
  pounds of smelt, served in one or two bowls, but if you divide it up 
  into more servings, you may need this much.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chillis:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh chillis, green or 
  red. Thai chilis would be most authentic, but other fairly hot chilis 
  can be used as well, using your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The Vietnamese prefer a 
  lighter, Chinese style Soy Sauce rather than the typical Japanese 
  style like Kikoman. Korean "Soy Sauce for Soup" would probably work 
  well also. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_soysz.html">
  <b>Soy Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Timing:</h3> &nbsp; How long this recipe takes 
  depends on the condition of the smelts when you buy them, and on their 
  size. For headless smelts (usually also cleaned) it can be as little 
  as 35 minutes. If you have rather small whole smelts, and want them 
  gutted, it can take up to 1-1/2 hours. A pound of very small smelts 
  took me about 25 minutes to clean, leaving the heads on. It would take 
  a bit less if the heads were removed, and fewer larger smelts would 
  take a fair amount less time.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can also be used with other 
  small fish. For example, I have used it quite successfully with 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_hbjapz.html"><b>Jpapanese Halfbeak</b></a></li>
