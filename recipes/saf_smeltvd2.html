These simple fried smelts are a fine appetizer for people who like fish. 
The firm but thin batter doesn't mask their taste. The dip 
reveals a Cambodian influence. See <a href="saf_smeltvd2.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) for 
how long it takes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (15 to 45 min - see <a href="saf_smeltvd2.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>SMELTS</b> as desired (see 
    <a href="saf_smeltvd2.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Dry them on paper towels if needed. 
    </li>
  <li>Toss the <b>Smelts</b> with the <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and 
    <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Dry items</b> for Batter. Make a well in the 
    center and pour in the <b>Ice Water</b>. Work it together into a 
    smooth coating batter. If too stiff, add more water by the teaspoon 
    until it is right.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (about 25 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Set out a wire rack for draining the <b>Fried Fish</b> and the 
    <b>Batter</b> in a shallow bowl.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, wok or 
    deep pan, heat enough <b>Oil</b> for deep frying to about 
    360&deg;/180&deg;C.</li>
  <li>One at a time drag the <b>Smelts</b> through the <b>Batter</b>, 
    shake off excess and lower them into the <b>Oil</b>. Do not crowd 
    the oil. Stir occasionally until Smelts are golden, 5 to 7 
    minutes. You will notice a sudden decrease in the amount of bubbling. 
    This indicates they are about cooked through, so now you need only 
    be concerned with color and crispness.</li>
  <li>Skim the <b>Smelts</b> out of the oil with your Spider, and place 
    on the rack to drain.</li> 
  <li>Serve fried <b>Smelts</b> immediately with the <b>Dip</b>. They 
    are best served warm, but can be reheated in an oven..</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Smelts:</h3> &nbsp; You'll probably be using 
  frozen smelts as fresh are not available in most regions. The pattern 
  recipe calls for the Smelts to be beheaded and cleaned, Whether you 
  use them that way depends on personal preference and the size of the 
  smelts. Very small ones are traditionally eaten "heads, guts and 
  feathers", but I gutted those in the photo example. Large ones should 
  be gutted, but I've found the heads to be no problem even in 5-1/2 
  inch fish, so the photo examples are "head-on".</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lime Pepper Dipping Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is basically a 
  Cambodian dip, but also used in Vietnam. It is very easy to make - 
  see our recipe <a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tuk Meric</b></a>. 
  </li>
<li id="03"><h3>Timing:</h3> &nbsp; How long this recipe takes 
  depends on the condition of the smelts when you buy them, on their 
  size. For headless smelts (usually also cleaned) it can be as little 
  as 35 minutes. If you have rather small whole smelts, and want them 
  gutted, it can take up to 1-1/2 hours. A pound of very small smelts 
  took me about 25 minutes to clean, leaving the heads on. It would take 
  a bit less if the heads were removed, and larger smelts would take  
  a fair amount less time.</li>
