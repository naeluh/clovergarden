This deep fried appetizer or <i>pulutan</i> (beer food) is a specialty 
of the Philippines, and highly thought of there. It is generally served 
with a dip made of vinegar, garlic and salt.

Bulaklak means "flower", from the shape. The finished product is a bit 
oily, but not as fatty as you might expect -  most of the fat has been 
rendered out.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Ruffle Fat:</b> &nbsp; This is a fatty membrane 
  which holds the small intestines in place. The intestines have been 
  removed. Ruffle fat can be found in the meat section of markets serving 
  a substantial Philippine community. Here in Southern California that 
  will be near almost any large hospital complexes, our health care 
  system runs almost entirely on Filipinos. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_rufflz.html"><b>Ruffle Fat</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Filipinos are very fond of 
  vinegar in cooking and produce some of the finest vinegars in the world. 
  These are made from sugar cane, coconut and palm sugar. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
