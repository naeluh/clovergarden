An essential for parties and family gatherings. The wrappers 
are thin, flaky and not oily. They are often made in large quantity, 
and frozen raw, to be fried any time, even without thawing.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - all hand chopped)
  <ol>
  <li>Make your <b>Lumpia Dips</b> (see <a href="sam_lumps1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Thaw the <b>Lumpia Wrappers</b>, about 3/4 hour.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>  PORK</b> and <b>SHRIMP</b> fine, or grind (chopping gives 
    better texture). Mix together.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CARROTS</b> very small. I use a julienning vegetable peeler 
    and peel the carrot into fine strips. I slice these 
    crosswise into tiny bits. Some use a grater. Mix with Pork.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>WATER CHESNUTS</b> small. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> crosswise 
    thin, white and green parts. Mix both with Pork.</li>     
  <li>Separate <b>EGGS</b>. Mix Yolks with Pork. Reserve whites for 
    sealing the rolls.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Sesame Oil</b> into the 
    Pork. Massage until everything is evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Carefully peel each wrapper from the stack and restack them 
    loosely. Keep them covered with plastic so they don't dry out.</li>
  <li>Set out a <b>Wrapper</b> with a corner towards you. Put about 
    2 T Stuffing in a line closer to you than the center (see 
    <a href="sam_lumps1x.html#gallery"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> for 
    details on wrapping them). Turn up the close corner over the 
    stuffing, then fold in the side corners and roll up tightly. At this 
    point they can be frozen, interleaved with wax paper or plastic so 
    they don't freeze together.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min, depending on size of batches)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Heat about 1/2 inch of <b>Oil</b> in a large iron skillet or an 
    electric skillet (my preference for best heat control and shape of 
    pan). <u>Do not</u> try to use a wok or kadhi. Bring the temperature 
    up to between  350&deg;F/177&deg;C and 375&deg;F/190&deg;C (a little 
    lower if they are frozen). Fry rolls in batches with enough room 
    so they can be easily manipulated and the temperature doesn't fall 
    too much. Turn them a couple times until they are done and lightly 
    browned. At one point they will start hissing more strongly, this is 
    when the filling has come up to full temperature. Remove from oil and 
    drain on paper toweling.</li>
  <li>Stash the rolls in a warm oven for a while to settle the heat. They 
    are dangerously hot inside at first.</li>
  <li>Arrange on a platter with desired garnishes and serve warm with 
    individual cups of Lumpia Dipping Sauces (see 
    <a href="sam_lumps1.html#04"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>If fried lumpia are stored in the refrigerator they will become a 
    little sodden, but the flakiness can be revived with a few minutes 
    uncovered in a 375&deg;F/190&deg;C oven.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lumpia / Spring roll Wrappers:</h3> &nbsp; These wheat flour 
  wrappers are available frozen from any Philippine market. They are 
  almost paper thin (0.014 inch /0.36 mm thick), but amazingly tough - 
  a good thing for when you peel them from the thawed stack. The 
  brands I have used are Pamana (8 inch, USA) and Spring Home (7-1/2 inch, 
  Singapore). Lacking these, some suggest using the common 6-3/4 inch 
  Chinese egg roll wrappers, but the ones I have sampled were much 
  thicker (0.034 inch / 0.86 mm), had very different frying 
  characteristics, and made denser, higher calorie and much less elegant 
  rolls.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Some insist that Lumpia 
  Shanghai are open at both ends. This is done by cutting an 8 inch 
  wrapper into two 4 x 8 inch pieces, spreading the filling across the 
  short way and then rolling it up the long way. The most common 
  ingredient variation is to replace the Carrot with well soaked dried 
  Black Mushrooms, chopped small.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; If 8 inch wrappers are used, they are often 
  cut diagonally into two pieces for serving, particularly for parties. 
  This is best done after frying, with a very sharp wavy edged bread 
  knife. When serving buffet style, best to make pitchers of one or two 
  dips and equip each with a tiny ladle. I use the Sweet and Sour 
  Dipping Sauce and the Vinegar Garlic Dip. Use tiny shallow plastic 
  cups, available from restaurant supply stores for individual dip 
  servings.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lumpia Dips:</h3> &nbsp; Various dipping sauces are used in the 
  Philippines.  Examples:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="sjv_swtsr1.html"><b>Sweet and Sour Dipping Sauce</b></a>
    - (Philippine) for spring rolls, crisp fries and roasted meats.[v1]</li>
  <li><a href="sjv_garvin1.html"><b>Vinegar Garlic Dip</b></a>
    - (Philippine) for spring rolls, crisp fries and roasted meats.[v0]</li>
  <li><a href="sjv_garvinc1.html"><b>Vinegar Garlic Dip w/Chili</b></a>
    - (Philippine) for spring rolls, crisp fries and roasted meats.[v3]</li>
  <li><a href="sjf_vinshp1.html"><b>Vinegar Shrimp Paste Dip</b></a>
    - (Philippine) for spring rolls, crisp fries and roasted meats.[v3]</li>
