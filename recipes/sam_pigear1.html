Chewy on the outside and crunchy on the inside, this appetizer will be 
a hit with broad spectrum porkophiles. Its quite sweet, so serve with a 
tart tart dip like 
<a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tik Marij</b></a> or 
<a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a> or 
plain Rice Vinegar.

   <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - min work)
   <ol>
  <li>Bring to a boil enough water to cover very well (the ears will 
    curl some) and add <b>PIG EARS</b>. Boil 
    for about 10 minutes, then pour out into the sink.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil enough water to cover pig ears, add <b>Ginger</b> 
    and <b>Pig Ears</b>. Simmer 45 minutes, then drain, keeping only the 
    ears. Cut the ears into large pieces, about three per ear.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Dust the <b>Pig Ears</b> completely but very lightly with rice flour 
    (or they'll stick hard to the wok and pull apart - less so with lard 
    than with oil).</li>
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok, make sure the sides are well oiled and stir 
    in the <b>Garlic</b> and <b>Pig Ear Pieces</b>. Fry  stirring and 
    tumbling the ears until the Garlic is golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and continue to cook over reduced heat 
    until the liquid thickens and begins to caramelize. Tumble the pig 
    ears frequently. When the oil has separated and you start getting a few 
    lumps of the coating floating free from the ears - that's when to pull 
    the ears (leaving the oil behind).</li>
  <li>Drain the ears and cool them thoroughly (they will become much less 
    sticky). Slice into 1/4 inch wide strips for serving. Serve at room 
    temperature with a tart dip like 
    <a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tik Marij</b></a> or 
    <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a> 
    or plain <b>Rice Vinegar</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Ears:</h3> &nbsp; You won't find these in supermarkets, except 
  maybe in Chicago, but they are common in the meat sections of markets 
  serving a Latin American, Eastern European or East / Southeast Asian 
  community. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_earz.html">
  <b>Pig Ears</b></a> page. No, there is no substitute, not even close.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary and Poland. The 
  American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid to 
  use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they told 
  us to use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is 
  now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or Avocado oil 
  for richer flavor.</li>      
<li id="03">
  <h3>Five Spice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard East and 
  Southeast Asian ingredient, variously made. It is available 
  commercially, but our recipe <a href="cys_fivespc1.html">
  <b>Five Spice Powder</b></a> is the most official version.</li>
