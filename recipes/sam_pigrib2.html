A delicious and substantial appetizer - the method is deep fried, but you 
could grill them instead. This dish came by way of Vietnam, but the 
dipping sauce is Cambodian <a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tuk 
Meric</b></a>, so it is likely from Khmer Krom, the Mekong delta region 
annexed from Cambodia.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 	(3-1/2 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and chop into 2" lengths. A sharp 
    Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect for 
    this job. If any pieces are too thick, cut them in half.</li>
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off the 
    hard root end. Smash the bottom 5 inches flat with the smooth side 
    of your kitchen mallet and slice very thin crosswise, Then pound in 
    mortar (<a href="sam_pigrib2.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Select red <b>THAI CHILIS</b> if you have some, or use green, or 
    half the number of Serranos (not as hot but a lot bigger). Chop fine, 
    then crush well in the mortar.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, chop fine, then pound in the mortar.</li>
  <li> Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>, 
    <b>Lemon Grass</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and massage into <b>Pork Ribs</b>. 
    Marinade at a cool room temperature for at least an hour (2 or 3 
    hours is better), turning occasionally.</li>
  <li>Make dipping sauce by squeezing fresh <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mixing 
    with <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Remove <b>Pork Ribs</b> from marinade and wipe off excess marinade.
    </li>
  <li>Heat deep fry <b>oil</b> hot enough to fry well, about 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C. Fry <b>Pork Ribs</b> in batches until browned. 
    Don't let the oil get too hot, the ribs need enough time to cook 
    through before they get too brown. Drain thoroughly and keep warm 
    while frying subsequent batches.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm with the <b>Dipping Sauce</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mortar:</h3> &nbsp; A large stone mortar and 
  pestle is traditional, but after crushing and chopping you could run 
  the marinade ingredients in a mini-prep food processor, adding each 
  ingredient in turn until you have a smooth paste. Actually, I run the 
  Lemon Grass and Chilies in the mini-prep and then pound in the mortar. 
  This gives me the better texture of mortar pounding without so much 
  pounding.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> If preparing in advance you can refrigerate in the 
  marinade overnight, or you can finish fry the ribs (trying not to eat 
  too many) and refrigerate them. When needed, reheat some of the oil 
  and fry them until heated through, drain well and serve. Or you can 
  heat them in the oven without additional oil.</li>
