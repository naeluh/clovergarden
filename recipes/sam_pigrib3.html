A Vietnamese take on spare ribs using Chinese and Southeast Asian 
ingredients. They're tender, intensely flavorful and without the awful 
neon red color and cloying sweetness found in Chinese American take-out.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min - 20 min work)
  <br>I make this using only my 13" Calphalon wok, washing between steps.
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths desired, generally 1-1/2 
    to 2 inches.  A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is perfect for this. Place them in a pan with plenty of water and bring 
    it to a boil for about 2 minutes. Pour out, rinse the ribs.and clean 
    the pan.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Pork Ribs</b> back in the pan with water to cover, bring to 
    a boil and simmer about 40 minutes. This will make the meat tender and 
    soften the cartilage to edibilty. Drain well and set aside. The broth 
    can be reserved for some other use.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Sauce Items</b>..</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and chop very fine (or grate). Mix.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, tear into shreads and soak in 
    plenty of cold water until needed. This will keep them green longer 
    when added to the recipe.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b>, stir in <b>Pork Ribs</b> 
    and fry stirring over high heat until lightly browned (about 5 minutes), 
    then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b> and fry stirring until garlic is crispy 
    and medium browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and tumble so all ribs are well coated. 
    Continue to fry stirring over high heat until liquid is evaporated, 
    sauce is carmelized.</li>
  <li>Take off heat, drain <b>Shreded Basil</b>, stir into the ribs and 
    finish with a sprinkling of sesame oil.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of napkins and finger bowls or wet towels.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Hoisin Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very common Chinese style 
  sweet bean sauce used for grilling and dipping. It can be found even 
  in the "Chinese" section of regular supermarkets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">

<li id="03">
  <h3>Five Spice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard Chinese 
  seasoning. There are several formulas but here's a recipe for the most 
  "official" formula. <a href="cys_fivespc1.html">
