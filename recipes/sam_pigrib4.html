This delicious appetizer is one of my favorites! I call it "Thai 
California" because I don't know the recipe's origin, though the 
ingredients are certainly Thai.

Ovens are very scarce in Thailand. A recipe like this would need to be 
wrapped in banana leaves and roasted over slow coals, which you can do 
if you wish (foil will also work). The color will be much lighter. This 
recipe has no intrinsic hotness - that comes from the dipping sauce used.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into 2 inch lengths. The best 
    way to do this is with a sharp Chinese cleaver knife and a soft faced 
    mallet to drive it through the bones.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> thin. Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> medium. Peel off any 
    grungy parts of <b>GINGER</b>, slice very thin and chop fine. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> from the stem ends (see <a href="sam_pigrib4.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>) 
    and chop coarse.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b> and run in a mini-prep 
    food processor (or pound in your big stone mortar) until reduced to 
    a paste.</li>
  <li>Masage <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Pork Ribs</b> and marinate 
    for at least 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. 
    Turn now and then.</li>
  <li>Make <a href="sjv_chiliherb1.html"><b>Chili Herb Dipping 
    Sauce</b></a> or sauce of your choice </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange ribs 
    on the sheet and place in the oven. Let them roast for 1-1/4 hours, 
    turning the sheet around at the midpoint so they'll be more even.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with the <b>Dipping Sauce</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Because this recipe is long cooked, 
  thicker, meatier ribs can be used, including those with a lot of 
  cartilage.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cilantro Stems:</h3> &nbsp; In Thailand fresh cilantro roots are 
  much used, but they are nearly impossible to get even here in Los 
  Angeles. The best we can do is use the stems which have a flavor half 
  way between roots and leaves. Start chopping your cilantro from the 
  stem end, reserving the leafy ends for another use (a few leaves in 
  the mix is ok).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this use a light 
  turbinado or similar sugar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Herb Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Of course you can use other dipping 
  sauces, but this one is delicious and highly compatible with the 
  marinade. See our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_chiliherb1.html"><b>Chili Herb Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; If preparing in advance you can refrigerate 
  in the marinade overnight, or you can finish roast the ribs and 
  refrigerate, reheating them in a 350&deg; oven until they sizzle.</li>
