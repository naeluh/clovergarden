  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b> and cut into lengths desired, generally 1-1/2 
    to 2 inches.  A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Chop <b>SHALLOT</b> very fine. 
    Mix together and pound to paste in a mortar. Mix <b>All Marinade 
    Items</b>. Stir in <b>Pork Ribs</b> and marinate, tumbling occasionally, 
    for 20 minutes or more.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Slice <b>ONION</b> into narrow 
    wedges. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok heat <b>Oil</b> to at least 360&deg;F/180&deg;C and fry 
    <b>Pork Ribs</b> in batches until lightly browned. Drain on paper 
    towels and set aside.</li>
  <li>Pour out the oil and clean the wok. Pour in the <b>Coconut Water</b> 
    and bring to a boil. Stir in the <b>Pork Ribs</b> and simmer covered, 
    stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes (see <a href="sam_pigrib5.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Uncover and simmer down until there are only a few tablespoons of 
    liquid left.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b>, <b>Chili Sauce</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Fry 
    stirring until the liquid is gone and the ribs are frying.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; If the ribs have a lot of cartilage I add 
  some regular water to the coconut water give them about 45 minutes 
  simmer time so the cartilage is edible - its a good source of calcium 
  and probably good for joints too.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this use Turbinado or 
  another lightly refined sugar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Water</h3> &nbsp; This is <u>NOT</u> coconut milk, but 
  the water from inside a Fresh Young Coconut. These are sold for the 
  water as the flesh is thin, jelly-like and lacks flavor. This water 
  is easily available canned, but the canned is invariably sweetened with 
  sugar (coconut sugar, we hope), so if you use it you need to cut back 
  or omit the sugar in the marinade. In any case, some coconuts will not 
  yield quite 1-1/3 cups, so it's a good idea to have a can on hand. Try 
  to find a brand that doesn't list water as the second ingredient. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconut</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Sauce</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous Huy Fong Sriracha Sauce will 
  do fine. Made in Los Angeles by a person thrown out of Vietnam by the 
  Communists (for being of Chinese descent), it is not quite authentic 
  (they don't have tasty red ripe Jalapeno chilis in Vietnam - yet) but 
  I don't hear anyone complaining.</li>
