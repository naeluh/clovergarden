These Thai spring rolls use Vietnamese style rice paper wrappers. You 
can use 8" circles to make long rolls, or larger circles quartered to 
make smaller shorter rolls. See <a href="sam_spring1x.html">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Make your <b>Spring Roll Sauce</b> (see <a href="sam_spring1.html#01">Note-1</a>).
    </li>
  <li>Chop or grind <b>PORK</b> and <b>SHRIMP</b> fine, mix together.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water 1/2 hour, stem and chop small. 
    Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in water 20 minutes, cut into 1" lengths. 
    Mix both with Pork.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine, shred <b>CARROT</b> very fine and mix both 
    with Pork.</li>     
  <li>Cook <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b> in boiling water just a few minutes until 
    pliable but not limp. Cut them into pieces about 1" long and mix with 
    Pork.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Black Pepper</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b> into Pork</li>
  <li>Lay out a damp cloth napkin on which to work. Put a plate in the 
    sink and run warm water into it (see <a href="sam_spring1.html#02">Note-2</a>). Soak 
    a sheet of rice paper in the warm water until pliable 
    (see <a href="sam_spring1.html#03">Note-3</a>), then move to the napkin to work. Do 
    not over-soak  You should be able to start another sheet soaking 
    immediately upon transferring one to the towel.</li>
  <li>Fill and roll the spring rolls.
    <ul>
    <li><b>IF</b> using 8" round rice paper put a sausage shaped dollop 
      of filling near one edge. Roll the rice paper tightly over filling 
      until half the circle is still flat, then fold the sides over the 
      filling. Continue to roll up tightly.</li>
    <li><b>IF</b> using "quadrant" rice papers (quarters of a 12" round), 
      soak two at a time. Lay one out on the napkin then the other the 
      same way but overlapping 3/4" farther up. Put a dab of filling near 
      the curved edge, roll once, fold the edges in and finish rolling.
      </li>
      </ul>
    Set rolls aside on wax paper or oiled foil to rest.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> 
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Heat about 1/2 inch of <b>Oil</b> in a large iron skillet 
    (<u>do not</u> try to use a wok or kadhi) to about 375&deg;F. Fry 
    rolls four or eight at a time depending on the size of your skillet. 
    Turn them a couple times until they are done and get a few brown 
    spots (See <a href="sam_spring1.html#04">Note-4</a>). Remove from oil and drain on 
    paper toweling.</li>
  <li>Stash the rolls in a warm oven for a while to settle the heat. They 
    are dangerously hot inside at first.</li>
  <li>Arrange on a platter with desired garnishes and serve warm with 
    individual bowls of Spring Roll Dipping Sauce. If you wish 
    (particularly for parties) you can cut the rolls in half diagonally 
    to make twice as many smaller pieces.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Spring roll sauce:</b> &nbsp; Various dipping 
  sauces are used in Thailand and Vietnam. Examples: 
  <a href="sjf_spring1.html"><b>Spring Roll Sauce #1</b></a> (Thai), 
  <a href="sjf_spring2.html"><b>Spring Roll Sauce #2</b></a> (Viet).
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Browning:</b> &nbsp; Rice paper wrappings do not 
  brown much by time the rolls are done. If you want your rolls to brown 
  more you have to use sugar water for soaking the rice paper - 1 t sugar 
  / cup of water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Soaking:</b> &nbsp; Different brands of rice paper 
  vary and some do not soften evenly. For instance, in my experience 
  Double Parrot brand is rather uneven while Double Horses brand is quite 
  even but takes longer to soften. If you have uneven paper, lay it out 
  on the towel to start wrapping from the firm edge.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Frying:</b> &nbsp; Cover the floor around your 
  stove with newspapers and maybe some foil over nearby burners. The rolls 
  will start to hiss and splatter when they are nearly done (that's when 
  the filling starts to steam). Watch your temperature - the rolls do not 
  cool the oil much so it's easy to go over-temperature. Keep it around 
  375&deg;F. Olive pommace, rice bran and peanut oils are good for this 
  job.</li>
