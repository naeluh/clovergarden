An excellent appetizer, combined with your dip of choice. It  presents 
contrasting textures and flavors, and is vegetarian too. It is quick and 
easy, but best to make the Shan Tofu a day ahead (also quick and easy).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (5 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>SHAN TOFU</b> as desired. Unless sliced very thin the 
    pieces will have a soft center. I usually slice about 3/16th of an 
    inch thick. Cut slices into rectangles or triangles of your choice. 
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (about 20 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>In a wok or kadhai, bring <b>Oil</b> about 1-1/2 inches deep to a 
    frying temperature of about 370&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Working in batches so they aren't crowded, fry <b>Tofu Pieces</b> 
    until puffy and light golden, a bit darker at the edges. Keep 
    tumbling them with your spider so they brown on both sides.</li> 
  <li>Hoist <b>Tofu</b> out with your spider, letting drain a few 
    seconds and dumping onto paper towels.
  <li>Serve <b>Tofu</b> warm or at a warm room temperature with 
    <b>Dip</b> of your choice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shan Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; This is more related to 
  Polenta than to soybean tofu. You can't buy it, but it's very easy 
  to make by our recipe <a href="sip_shantfu1.html"><b>Shan 
  Tofu</b></a>. Use the 2-1/2 cup formula because you want it quite 
  firm for this recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is our run-away choice for 
  just about anything Burmese (and beyond). It is not really chili-hot, 
  unless you want it to be, and is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_chilgar1.html"><b>Chili Garlic Sauce</b></a>.</li>
