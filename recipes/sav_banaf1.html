One of the most famous snacks produced by street vendors in Thailand. 
While you can't hope to duplicate the skills of a Thai street 
vendor in your kitchen, you can, with care, still produce some tasty 
bananas.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 2 min work)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF using</u>: &nbsp; Mix 1 T Pink or White Lime Paste with 
    2-1/2 cups water. Let sit until solids sink to the bottom, about 
    30 minutes. Pour off clear liquid as needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Slice <b>BANANAS</b> lengthwise about 1/4 inch thick, usually three 
    cuts. They should not be thicker or they will not stay crispy.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Batter items</b> &nbsp; Stir in more water if needed to 
    have a rather loose batter. It should coat the bananas thinly. 
    Note: I have cut the pattern recipe's sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup. 
    Use your own best judgement here.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (about 20 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Bring <b>Oil</b> to a frying temperature, about 360&deg;F/180&deg;C.
    A deep iron skillet with about 1/2 inch of oil works well and has 
    plenty of room so the bananas aren't crowded.</li>
  <li>Working in batches so they aren't crowded and the oil temperature 
    doesn't drop too far. Dip <b>Banana Slices</b> into the batter to 
    coat completely, then transfer quickly into the hot oil. Fry until 
    golden brown, turning once or twice. Lift out and set on paper towels. 
    Between batches, Use your <a href="../ke/ke_spider1.html"><b>Spider 
    Skimmer</b></a> to remove loose chunks of batter from the oil.</li> 
  <li>Serve immediately, they are best when still a bit hot. See also 
    <a href="sav_banaf1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bananas:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is <u>peeled</u> bananas. These should 
  be small cooking type bananas that are still slightly under-ripe. Thai 
  Gluay Naam Waa are used in Thailand, but "Thai Bananas" (not quite the 
  same) are imported in large quantity from Mexico. These are quite 
  sensitive to ripeness and should be mostly yellow for this recipe. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bn_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Bananas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Flour</h3> &nbsp; This is regular rice flour, not 
  sweet/glutenous rice flour.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut, fine grated:</h3> &nbsp; This is <u>unsweetened</u> 
  finely grated dried coconut.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lime Water:</h3> &nbsp; This is to make the batter more alkaline 
  so it is firmer and browns better. Lime Paste, made from cockleshells 
  baked at a high temperature, is available in small tubs from markets 
  serving a large Southeast Asian population. To make water, 1 T paste 
  to 2-1/2 cups water. Let sit until solids sink to the bottom (about 
  30 minutes). Pour off the clear water as needed. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sa_limez.html"><b>Lime</b></a> page. Baking 
  Soda can be used as a substitute, 1/2 Tablespoon to 3/4 cup of water, 
  but the texture will be less firm. For the photo batch, since I had 
  not yet found the Lime Paste at an Asian market, but wanting a similar 
  texture, I used 2   Tablespoons of Philippine food grade Lye Water 
  in 3/4 cup water.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sesame, white:</h3> &nbsp; This is <u>untoasted</u> white sesame 
  seeds.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a stable, high temperature oil like Olive 
  Pomace. After frying a recipe of bananas the oil will appear quite 
  dark, but if it is a stable oil you can filter it through a paper 
  towel and it will be fine for frying other thing. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Reheating</h3> &nbsp; These can be partially re-crisped in the 
  oven. Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C. Set bananas on a wire 
  grate so they will be exposed to dry heat all around. Place in the 
  oven for about 20 minutes. Not quite as good as fresh from the oil, 
  but still pretty good.</li>
