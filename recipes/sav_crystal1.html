These popular rolls are a delicious appetizer. In Vietnam, diners will wrap 
them in a lettuce leaf along with herbs and cucumber, then eat them with a 
dip.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs for 28 ea)
  <ol>
  <li>Make your dipping sauce: Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Chop 
    <b>CHILIS</b> fine. Mix both with <b>Fish Sauce</b> (see <a href="sav_crystal1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Boil plenty of <b>Water</b>, let it cool a little and pour over 
    <b>Rice Vermicelli</b>. Let it soak until soft, then drain thoroughly 
    (these aren't as fool-proof as bean threads).</li>
  <li>Boil more <b>Water</b>, let cool a little and pour over 
    <b>MUSHROOMS</b> and <b>WOOD EARS</b>. Let soak until soft, about 30 
    min. Squeeze out thoroughly and slice into narrow matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PICKLED LEEKS</b>, <b>DILL PICKLES</b> and <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> 
    into narrow matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CARROT</b> fine (a julienning vegetable peeler works well 
    for this.</li>     
  <li>Lay out a damp cloth napkin on which to work. Put a plate in the sink 
    and run warm water into it. Soak sheets of rice paper in the warm water 
    until pliable (see <a href="sav_crystal1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>), then move to the 
    napkin to work. Do not over-soak  You should be able to start another 
    sheet soaking immediately upon transferring one to the towel. </li>
  <li>Fill and roll the crystal rolls - see <a href="sav_crystal1.html">
    <b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.
    <ul>
    <li><b>IF</b> using 8" round rice paper put a sausage shaped dollop of 
      filling near one edge. Roll the rice paper tightly over filling until 
      half the circle is still flat, then fold the sides over the filling. 
      Continue to roll up tightly.</li>
    <li><b>IF</b> using "quadrant" rice papers (quarters of a 12" round), 
      soak two at a time. Lay one out on the napkin then the other the 
      same way but overlapping 3/4" farther up. Put a dab of filling near the 
      curved edge, roll once, fold the edges in and finish rolling.</li>
      </ul>
    Set rolls aside on wax paper or oiled foil to rest.</li>
  <li>Arrange on a platter with desired garnishes and serve warm with 
    individual bowls of Dipping Sauce. If you wish (particularly 
    for parties) you can cut the rolls in half diagonally to make twice as 
    many smaller pieces.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Papers / Banh Trang:</h3> &nbsp; these 
  almost transparent rice sheets are available in various sizes at any 
  market that serves a Southeast Asian community.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Vermicelli:</h3> &nbsp; Often called "Rice Stick", 
  Do not confuse these with bean threads which behave differently (but, 
  well, those would work too).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; Also called "Wood Ears" and other names, 
  these expand greatly when soaked, so use plenty of water. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickled Leeks</h3> &nbsp; These are available in jars and resemble 
  elongated pickled cocktail onions. Pickled onions can be used if these 
  are not available.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Soaking:</h3> &nbsp; Different brands of rice paper vary and some 
  do not soften evenly. For instance, in my experience Double Parrot 
  brand is rather uneven while Double Horses brand is quite even but 
  takes longer to soften. If you have uneven paper, lay it out on the 
  towel to start wrapping from the firm edge.</li>
