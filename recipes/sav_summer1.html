These popular rolls are a delicious Cambodian appetizer that requires 
no cooking. Serve them with Tuk Trey or other dip. They are vegetarian, 
unless you add shredded Shrimp, Pork or Chicken (shrimp is most common).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - for 24 rolls)
  <br>Note: all weights of vegetables are <u>after cutting</u> because 
    actual yield can be quite variable. Weight for Vermicelli is dry.
  <ol>
  <li>Boil plenty of <b>Water</b>, let it cool a little and pour over 
    <b>Rice Vermicelli</b>. Let it soak until soft, but still a bit 
    chewy. This can be 20 to 40 minutes depending on thickness. Drain 
    thoroughly. Stretch them out and cut to 3-1/4 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into fine strips. A julienning 
    vegetable peeler is invaluable for this. Cut to about 3-1/4 inch 
    lengths.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CUCUMBER</b>. Use a julienning vegetable peeler to peel it 
    into fine strips, down to the seed mass.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into thin strips about 3-1/4 inches long.</li>
  <li>Pinch off the root threads from the <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b>. This will 
    prevent them from tangling and make handling easier. It also gives 
    you a chance to eliminate broken and discolored sprouts.</li> 
  <li>Cut or tear <b>LETTUCE</b> leaves into pieces that will line the 
    inside of the rolls
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min - for 24 rolls)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Lay out a damp cloth napkin on which to work. Put a large unrimmed 
    plate in the sink and run warm water into it. Dip sheets of rice 
    paper into the warm water for about 3 seconds (see 
    <a href="sav_summer1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>), then immediately move it to the napkin 
    to work. Do not over-soak, it will continue to soften while you 
    add the filling.</li>
  <li>Fill and roll the rolls- see 
    <a href="sav_summer1x.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>. If 
      you are organized you can do this in less thatn 2 minutes per 
      roll.
    <ol>
      <li>Set a piece of lettuce just in from the near edge of the rice 
        paper</li>
      <li>Arrange the <b>Vegetable strips</b> and <b>Vermacelli</b> over 
        the Lettuce, finishing with the <b>Bean Sprouts</b>. Place no 
        more than 2 <b>Mint Leaves</b> over the filling, then sprinkle 
        generously with <b>Cilantro Leaves</b>.</li>
      <li>Wet your fingers so they don't stick. Picking up the edge 
        nearest to you roll over the filling until you are at the 
        center of the <b>Rice Paper</b>.</li>
      <li>Fold in the two sides. <u>Be aware</u>: when rice paper 
        touches rice paper even for a second, the bond is permanent.
        </li>
      <li>Continue rolling up the roll. You can tighten the roll as 
        you go.</li>
      <li>Set rolls aside on wax paper to rest. They must not touch 
        each other. If making ahead, see <a href="sav_summer1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>.
        </li>
        </ol></li>
  <li>Arrange on a platter with desired garnishes and serve warm with 
    individual bowls of Dipping Sauce. You may wish (particularly 
    for buffet service) to cut the rolls in half to make twice as 
    many smaller pieces that are easier to handle. If you are using 
    9-1/2 inch Rice Papers instead of 8 inch, you will definitely want 
    to cut them in half.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Rice Papers / Banh Trang:</b> &nbsp; These 
  almost transparent rice sheets are available in various sizes at any 
  market that serves a Southeast Asian community. Buy more than you 
  need, because there will be breakage. The steps above are 
  for 8 inch diameter circles. If using 9-1/2 inch circles, cut the 
  vegetables about 3/4 inch longer. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Rice Vermicelli:</b> &nbsp; [Rice Stick] Do 
  not confuse these with bean threads which behave much differently. 
  Those would work too, but need to be simmered tender.   Straight 
  vermicelli is best for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Cucumber</b> &nbsp; A standard green blimp 
  cucumber works well here. Just peel, then using a julienning peeler 
  work around the cuke until you're down to the seed mass. Eat the 
  seed mass with a vinegar dip.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Mint Leaves:</b> &nbsp; These are strong so use only 
  2 leaves per roll. If it is still too minty for your taste, use Thai 
  Basil or some other herb.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Tuk Trey Dip:</b> &nbsp; This is an essential 
  Cambodian dip, similar to Vietnamese Nuoc Cham. It is easy to make, 
  see our recipe <a href="sjf_tuktrey1.html"><b>Tuk Trey</b></a>. 
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <b>Ginger Sauce</b> &nbsp; This is another dip 
  that works well with these rolls. See our recipe 
  <a href="sjf_gingsc1.html"><b>Ginger Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <b>Soaking:</b> &nbsp; Different brands of Rice Paper 
  vary in soaking time, and some do not soften evenly. If you have uneven 
  paper, lay it out on the towel to start wrapping from the firm edge. 
  Do not oversoak, the Rice Paper will continue to soften as you work. 
  If over-soaked it will be difficult to work with.</li>
<li id="08"><b>Doing Ahead:</b> - see 
  <a href="sav_summer1x.html#clam"><b>Clamshell Photo</b></a>. Keep at 
  room   temperature it storage won't be too long. Rice noodles and rice 
  paper stiffen some with refrigeration, though they are still quite 
  edible. For this reason, I usually prepare all the fillings (except 
  rice   noodles) the evening before and refrigerate overnight. I do the 
  rolling a few hours before the party. Be careful the rice paper 
  doesn't get dry.
  <ol>
  <li>Get some 8 inch square plastic Clamshells. These are available 
    from Smart &amp; Final and other Restaurant Supply stores.</li>
  <li>Line the bottom of the Clamshell with Wax Paper. Arrange 4 
    rolls so they don't touch each other, and a 5th over on the side. 
  <li>Cover the rolls with Wax Paper and arrange 5 rolls over them so 
    the center 3 rest between the lower rolls and keep them apart. 
    You can put another roll over the one on the side.</li>
  <li>Cover this layer with Wax Paper. Arrange 4 rolls over the 5 so 
    they tend to keep the 5 from touching each other.</li>
  <li>If storage will be long, cover with another sheet of wax paper 
    and place a smaller piece of damp paper towel over it to assure 
    sufficient humidity.</li>
  <li>Snap the Clamshell shut. Do not refrigerate unless you have to.
    </li>
    </ol></li>
