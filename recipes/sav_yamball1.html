These small balls are an excellent snack or appetizer, both tasty and 
attractive - and you can be pretty sure nobody else will be bringing 
these. They are easy to make and are very well behaved in the oil.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 40 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>SWEET POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes. Place in a pan 
    with water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer until quite soft, 
    about 25 minutes. Let cool for handling.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>GINGER ROOT</b>.</li>
  <li>Mash <b>Sweet Potatoes</b> very smooth, then mash together all 
    <b>Ball items</b>. Work it into a stiff dough. Let it sit for 
    20 minutes or so to adjust (it'll get a bit stickier).</li>
  <li>Adjust dough stickiness. Cautiously add a little water if too 
    dry, a little more rice flour if too wet. The correct stickiness 
    is not sticky enough to stick to your hands as you roll balls, but 
    sticky enough to easily pick up a coating of Sesame Seeds.</li>
  <li>Form <b>Dough</b> into small balls, about 1 inch diameter. Roll 
    in <b>Sesame Seeds</b> until well coated. Set them out on a tray 
    in a single layer.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, wok or 
    deep pan, heat enough <b>Oil</b> for deep frying to 375&deg; to 
    400&deg;F (190&deg; to 200&deg;C). Fry <b>Balls</b> in batches of 
    no more than 10 until they float well - then another minute. 
    They will expand a little, but not a lot. Keep the temperature 
    below 400&deg;F. If you get blow-outs, you have cooked a little 
    too long for your temperature. Balls that have suffered a blow-out 
    are still perfectly good to eat, just a little lighter.</li>
  <li>Fish out with your Spider and drain on paper towels. Let them 
    cool to room temperature. They hold a lot of heat inside for quite 
    a while. </li> 
  <li>Serve with <b>Tuk Trey</b> or <b>Simple Dipping Sauce</b>. They 
    are usually stuck with skewers to make them easier to dip.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweet Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The the photos clearly show Purple 
  Sweet Potatoes, sold as "Yams" in North America. White Sweet Potatoes 
  can also be used, but may need a touch moe sugar, and orange ones, 
  also sold here as "Yams", would work. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/mg_mglory.html"><b>Morning Glory / Yam</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it granulated or in lumps of 
  about 1 Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refined 
  sugar such as Turbinado. See also <a href="sav_yamball1.html#10"><b>Comments</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Indian 
  Curry Powder" without definition. Lets just presume Madras curry powder 
  (invented by the English) will do. Ship brand and Sun brand are good 
  and widely available - or make it better from our recipe 
  <a href="iys_madras1.html"><b>Madras Curry Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Glutinous Rice Flour:</h3> [Sweet Rice Flour] (Contains no Gluten). 
  This flour is different from regular Rice Flour, and provides a unique 
  chewy texture to many sweets and the like. It is available from most 
  Asian markets, usually imported from Thailand, but also made in 
  California (Koda Farms).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; You will need a <u>lot</u> of White 
  Sesame Seeds. Best place to get them is a Korean market where quick 
  turnover assures freshness, and they are relatively inexpensive in 
  1/2 pound containers.</li>   
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a fairly neutral high temperature oil. I 
  recommend Olive Pomace for health and durability.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tuk Trey Dip:</h3> &nbsp; This is an indispensable Cambodian 
  condiment and ingredient, nearly identical to Vietnamese Nuoc Cham. 
  It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="sjf_tuktrey1.html"><b>Tuk Trey</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Simple Dipping Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a simple, every-day 
  dipping sauce that is quite serviceable, and can be 
  put together in 5 minutes. See our recipe 
  <a href="sjf_smpdip1.html"><b>Simple Dipping Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Handling:</h3> &nbsp; These balls are partially hollow, and the 
  inside remains jelly-like, so they are easily deformed. When making 
  them ahead, keep them in a single layer. I recommend plastic clamshells, 
  available at Smart &amp; Final or other restaurant supplies (see 
  <a href="sav_yamball1x.html"><b>Photos</b></a>). These will keep 
  them safe, and they can even be kept refrigerated for a few days - 
  the outside will be a little bit more leathery, but they are still 
  just fine.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; As with so many Asian recipes, I have cut 
  the sugar in half to better fit Western tastes. Personally, using 
  Purple Sweet Potatoes, I could do without any sugar at all, but others 
  may think otherwise. Adjust to your own taste, and the sweetness of 
  your Sweet Potatoes.</li>
