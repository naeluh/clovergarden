Considered almost essential for parties, this salad is very easy to 
make - thought some of the ingredients I've listed may not be easy to find 
in Red States. See <a href="sdd_frusal1.html#10"><b>Details</b></a> for variations.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fruit Cocktail:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is as "in the can". That's 
  a 30 ounce can, or 2 14 ounce cans before draining.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Macapuno:</h3> &nbsp; This is strips of mutant coconut - a variety 
  where the flesh never solidifies but remains a stiff jelly. This is 
  available in well stocked Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pm_prod.html"><b>Palm & Coconut Products</b></a> 
  page.  <b>Subst:</b> you can use grated flesh from inside a fresh 
  young coconut (the kind with the husk on that's sold for drinking). 
  These are widely available, and the semi gelatinous flesh is called 
  <i><b>Buko</b></i>, thus "Buko Salad". For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/coconut.html"><b>Coconut Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Nata de Coco:</h3> This is a stiff gel made from fermented coconut 
  water. It is usually cut into dice and packed in a sweet syrup. It is 
  available in well stocked Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pm_prod.html"><b>Palm &amp; Coconut Products</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaong:</h3> &nbsp; This is the small immature fruits of the Arenga 
  sugar palm, packed in a moderately sweet syrup. It is available in well 
  stocked Philippine markets in three colors, dyed bright green, dyed 
  bright red, and the natural translucent white. The red is usually 
  used for this fruit salad, taking the place of maraschino cherries 
  (the Philippines have lots of palm trees and very few cherry trees, 
  which wouldn't fruit in the tropics anyway). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pm_prod.html"><b>Palm & Coconut Products</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Apples:</h3> &nbsp; These are important for the texture of the 
  salad, adding some crunchiness.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Pineapple:</h3> &nbsp; This may be fresh or canned. Canned is 
  most often used in the Philippines.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Edam Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Red wax coated balls of Edam cheese are 
  popular in the Philippines, This is a hold over from sailing ship days 
  when European countries shipped Edam cheese to all their colonies 
  because of its good keeping properties. A Gouda or mild Chedder could 
  also be used.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Cream Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Not all recipes include this, but it 
  makes for a creamier dressing. Amount varies from 4 to 8 ounces.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Condensed Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This ingredient provides most of the 
  sweetness, as condensed milk is so heavily sweetened it tastes like 
  liquid caramel candy.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Details:</h3> &nbsp; About the only things all recipes agree on is 
  the amount of Fruit Cocktail to start with, and that there will be 
  gelatinous coconut (or at least <a href="sdd_frusal1.html#02"><b>Buko</b></a>), cream 
  and condensed milk. There are endless variations in fruit and cheeses. 
  This salad was adopted from the Americans during the time the 
  Philippines were a U.S. Commonwealth. The cans provided fruits not 
  available in the tropics but traditional in fruit salads. Canned fruit 
  salad is now so traditional no-one would think to use fresh, but the 
  tropical fruits included may vary, and some recipes add canned 
  peaches.</li>
