This is a great party salad, so is sized for parties. It can be made 
hours ahead and kept refrigerated, up to adding the Dressing, and will 
be durable on the table.

<p>This recipe will make enough for about 8 salad servings, and will 
serve 12 or more on the buffet, if there's much else.</p>
  <b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Simmer <b>CHICKEN</b> with a few chunks of smacked ginger and 
     a few scallions. Simmer until just done. Let the Chicken cool 
     in the broth, then remove and refrigerate. See Notes 
     <a href="sgc_chksalv1.html#01"><b>1</b></a> and <a href="sgc_chksalv1.html#09"><b>9</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>SESAME SEEDS</b> if you don't have them on hand. 
    See our recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
    Seeds</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Dry pan roast <b>RAW PEANUTS</b> if you don't have them on hand. 
    See our recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted 
    Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Dressing:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>THAI CHILIS</b> 
    crosswise very thin. Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. Mix all 
    <b>Dressing items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Salad:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Cut <b>Onion</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Mix into the <b>Dressing</b> to marinate.</li>
  <li>Core <b>CABBAGE</b> and shred. Weight is after shredding.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CARROTS</b>. I use a julienning vegetable peeler, then 
    cut the strips about 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Pick Leaves from Stems of <b>Mint</b>, <b>Ciliantro</b>, and 
    <b>Rau Ram</b>. Measures are whole leaves lightly packed.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Salad items</b> (except the Onions, which 
    are marinating in the dressing).</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Seasoning items</b> into the Salad.</li> 
  </ol>
<b><u>Finish:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (8 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Tear <b>Chicken</b> into shreds, not too small and up to 1-1/2 
    inches long. Mix into the <b>Cabbage Salad</b>.</li>  
  <li>When ready to serve, pour <b>Dressing</b> over the salad, including 
    the Onions, and toss well to coat.</li>
  <li>Serve cool.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; I always use whole skin-on thighs for best 
  flavor and texture, and best broth. You'll need about 2 pounds of 
  skin-on, bone in Thighs to make 12 ounces of simmered meat. See 
  <a href="sgc_chksalv1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a> about Broth.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; With 3 chilis, this salad has a pleasing 
  sharpness by Southern California standards. Even if you're from the 
  Frozen North, I wouldn't go below 2.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refines sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The recipe specifies "Sesame oil (not roasted)", 
  which means Gingelly Oil, which has a light sesame seed flavor. This 
  is available from Indian and Southeast Asian markets here in 
  Los Angeles, but perhaps not where you live. Actually, mine was pretty 
  old, so I just used my Extra Virgin Olive Oil. They don't use that in 
  Vietnam, because they don't have it.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after coring and shredding. You can 
  use regular green Head Cabbage, or Napa Cabbage. Both are used in Asia.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rao Ram:</h3> &nbsp; [Vietnamese Mint] This is available in markets 
  serving Vietnamese  communities, at least here in Southern California, 
  but perhaps not where you live. Culantro is probably closest, but not 
  available in most of North America. Otherwise use Cilantro, Thai Basil, 
  or more Mint. The pattern recipe suggested more Mint.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Southeast Asian, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always 
  be on hand for those cuisines. They are available already toasted in 
  Asian markets, but are better and more reliable freshly made at home. 
  See our easy recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
  Seeds</b></a>. Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, 
  they will keep for several months.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Peanuts, Dry Roasted</h3> &nbsp; This is a staple item in  
  Southeast Asian and southern Chinese cooking, kept on hand in most 
  households. They are much different from commercially roasted peanuts. 
  For details see our <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted 
  Peanuts</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Chicken Broth</h3> &nbsp; Simmering the Chicken makes quite a bit 
  of broth, but uses none. What is made can be used for other recipes. 
  I always include skins, bones and fat when simmering Chicken. After 
  the meat is done, cooled and removed, I give the broth and all the 
  skins, bones, and stuff in it another hour of simmering. I then strain 
  it, defat it using my gravy separator, and refrigerate it until needed.
