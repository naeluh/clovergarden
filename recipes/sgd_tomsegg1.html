An interesting, refreshing and mildly salty salad much enjoyed in the 
Philippines. Of course it is served to accompany other dishes, not as 
a salad course (Philippine meals are all one course).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Salted Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; These are eggs (almost always duck eggs) 
  that have been soaked in a strong salt brine for at least 3 weeks, 
  usually longer. They are available in Philippine and Southeast Asian 
  markets. In the Philippine markets the shells will generally be dyed 
  bright red, or they may be shrink wrapped in bright red plastic. Take 
  care - there is still room for error, because they may be cooked or 
  not cooked. If not cooked, boil for 40 minutes before use - salted 
  eggs take much longer to cook than regular eggs. In other Southeast 
  Asian markets the eggs are likely not dyed, and easily confused with 
  fresh duck eggs. Read the label carefully. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html"><b>Eggs</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lime Juice:</h3> &nbsp; In the Philippines Calamansi juice might 
  be used instead of Lime juice. Here in California squeezing Calamansis 
  would be prohibitively expensive, but frozen Calamansi juice is 
  available in Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/citrus.html"><b>Citrus</b></a> page.</li>
