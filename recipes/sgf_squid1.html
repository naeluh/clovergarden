One of the most famous Thai salads, said to be the signature salad of 
Bangkok. There's quite a bit of prep work, but it can be done 
well ahead.  
</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
This is a durable salad, good for buffet parties, and can even be made 
completely a day ahead and refrigerated. This recipe will make 4 or 5 
big dinner salads, quite a few more salad size servings.

  <b><u>Prep Squid</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min - exclusive of cleaning squid)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>SQUID</b> as required (see <a href="sgf_squid1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b>
    </a>). Cut into 3/4 inch wide rings if small, or into 1-1/2 inch 
    by 1/2 inch strips if large. If using tentacles, cut them into 
    lengths of 1 to 1-1/2 inch lengths, depending on size.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a rolling boil in a pot into which you 
    can lower a wire strainer. Place squid in the strainer (not too much 
    at a time) and lower it into the rapidly boiling water for 10 seconds 
    (small squid) to 18 seconds (large squid). Immediately refresh with 
    cold running water. Don't overcook or the squid will be very tough. 
    Drain and set aside. I using tentacles, cook them after all the rest 
    is done. </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Vegie Mix</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min) &nbsp;  
    (Mixing as you go).
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Strip the tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off the 
    hard root end. Smash the bottom 3 or 4 inches of the bulb with your 
    kitchen mallet and cut crosswise with a razor sharp knife as thin as 
    you possibly can.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>KAFIR LEAVES</b> as tightly as you can and slice them into 
    the finest threads you can. Make a few cuts through the threads so 
    they are not too long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CUCUMBERS</b> in half lengthwise. Slice diagonally about 
    3/16 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.
  <li>Cut <b>GRAPE TOMATOES</b> in half crosswise, or, if you have the 
    larger Cherry Tomatoes, also cut the halves in half lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>MINT LEAVES</b> from stems and chop coarse.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Dressing</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b> and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> and stir in <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  <li>In a small pan, heat <b>Oil</b> to about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. 
    Stir in <b>Shallot mix</b> and  <b>Chili Flake</b>. Fry stirring 
    until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Stir in <b>Lime Juice mix</b> for 
    another 30 seconds. Take off the heat and stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Serving</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Shred <b>CABBAGE</b> fine for use as a serving bed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for Garnish.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, lay a bed of <b>Shreded Cabbage</b> on plates 
    or serving platter.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Squid</b> with <b>Dressing</b> and tumble to coat well. 
   Tumble in <b>Vegie mix</b>. Lay <b>Salad</b> over <b>Cabbage beds</b>, 
   garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> (also, see <a href="sgf_squid1.html#08">Note-8</a>).
   </li>
  <li>Serve cool, but not chilled.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp; The amount is for whole fresh 
  squid, prepared per one of the instruction pages (depending on size) 
  linked from our <a href="../ingred/seasquid.html"><b>Squid</b></a> 
  page. If using cleaned frozen squid, you will need about 1-1/4 
  pounds.</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; You want a fairly small 
  stalk here. For preparation details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a 
  stem. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html">
  <b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If you don't have them, grate the zest 
  of a lime (green part only) before you squeeze it for juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> If at all possible, use small 
  cucumbers that don't need to be skinned or seeded, such as Persian, 
  Japanese or European. If you have only the standard waxed green 
  blimps, peel them, seed them, cut lengthwise in quarters, then 
  measure out the given weight.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili flake</h3> &nbsp; I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  make this recipe decently spicy by Southern California standards, but 
  scandalously mild by Thai standards. Use your own best judgement. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; Pure Olive Oil works well here but Virgin would be 
  too non-Thai - or use Peanut, Rice Bran or similar oils.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Buffet Service:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have room for a wide, 
  shallow bowl, just mix the Cabbage and Cilantro into the salad.</li>
