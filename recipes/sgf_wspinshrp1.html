Legal in California, Water Spinach (Ong Choy, Pak Bung) is banned in 
many US States. This flavorful salad fully exploits the contrast between 
its wilted leaves and crunchy stems, as well as its affinity for shrimp.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pak Bung:</h3> &nbsp; [Ong Choy, Water Spinach, Swamp Cabbage] 
  &nbsp; Sold in California as Ong Choy, this vegetable is very popular 
  with all Southeast Asian cultures, but is a controled substance in some 
  states. In California it can be produced by licensed growers and 
  transported without a permit. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste</h3> &nbsp; Thai or Vietnamese.  For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sesame Seeds, Toasted:</h3> &nbsp; These are an essential item for 
  Chinese, Southeast Asian, Japanese and Korean cooking, so should always 
  be on hand for these cuisines. They are available already toasted in 
  Asian markets, but are better and more reliable freshly made at home. 
  See our easy recipe <a href="kig_sescr1.html"><b>Toasted Sesame 
  Seeds</b></a>. Sealed in an air tight jar, away from heat and sunlight, 
  they will keep for several months.</li>
