Beef salads like this are very popular here in Southern California. 
Served just cool, this recipe can be a salad, or a cool summer main 
dish for two. For a mixed gathering you can make it fairly mild and 
pass Thai <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a>

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into thin slices about 2 inches 
    long and 1/2 inch wide, or whatever your beef can do (but keep it 
    thin).</li>
  <li>Strip the tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off the 
    hard root end. Smash the bottom 3 or 4 inches of the bulb with your 
    kitchen mallet and cut crosswise as thin as you possibly can with a 
    razor sharp knife.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> very thin.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>MINT</b> and <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves from the stems and chop 
    them medium to coarse. Chop <b>SCALLION</b> very small.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b> and mix together all <b>Dressing items</b>.
    </li>
  <li>In a spacious iron skillet or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> very hot. Fry  
    <b>Beef</b> over highest flame tossing continuously until the raw 
    color is completely gone, but the beef is still a little rare. Drain 
    on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Beef</b> and <b>Dressing</b>. Refrigerate until well 
    chilled, turning now and then.</li>
  <li>Serve chilled or just cool, as you prefer, garnished as you please 
    (photo is with slices of Fresno Chili and Scallion brushes).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. 
  On the other hand, beef with too little fat lacks flavor, there should 
  be a little marbled through it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; You want a small stem here. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Toasted Rice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is available 
  commercially in Southeast Asian markets, but is very easy to make 
  yourself. Recipe for <a href="syv_ricetst1.html"><b>Toasted Rice 
  Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Powder</h3> &nbsp; Here's where you regulate 
  the basic hotness. I use Indian Reshampatti which is fairly hot, but in 
  this small amount gives a very moderate bite. You could use Korean or 
  Kashmir (both less hot) or Aleppo (tasty but very little heat) if you 
  desire. As always avoid Southwest "chili powder" mixes. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powders</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; Pure Olive Oil works well here but Virgin would 
  be too non-Thai, or use Peanut, Rice Bran or similar oils.</li>
