A totally stunning palette of flavors! Larbs (Laab, Laap) are the famous 
chopped meat salads of Laos and Issan.  This recipe is mild enough for 
a mixed group, supply <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html">

  <b><u>Prep Meats</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Do Ahead)
  <ol>
  <li>Grill or Broil the <b>BEEF</b> until medium to medium well done - 
    140&deg;F to 150&deg;F (60&deg;C to 65&deg;C). Set aside to rest 
    until cool.</li>
  <li>IF using, cook <b>BEEF TRIPE</b> until tender. For instructions 
    see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> 
    page.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hours - 1-3/4 hours work)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut <b>Beef</b> across the grain into thin slices, then the slices 
    into narrow strips and the strips crosswise into small dice. Then, 
    with a heavy knife, chop the beef very fine.</li>
  <li>IF using, slice <b>Tripe</b> thin and cut into 1/4 inch lengths.
    </li>
  <li>Strip the tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off 
    the hard root end. Smash the bottom 4 inches of the stem with your 
    kitchen mallet, then cut crosswise as thin as you possibly can with 
    a razor sharp knife.</li>
  <li>Roll up the <b>LIME LEAVES</b> tightly from tip to base. Slice them 
    into threads from both sides of the central rib. Chop the threads 
    fine. Mix with Lemon Grass.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> as thin as you can and chop fine. Mix with 
    Lemon Grass.</li>
  <li>Pound <b>Lemon Grass mix</b> in a big mortar as best you can.</li>
  <li>Pull <b>MINT</b>, <b>CILANTRO</b> and <b>RAU RAM</b> leaves from 
    the stems and chop them coarse to medium Chop <b>SCALLION</b> very 
    small. Cut <b>THAI CHILIS</b> in half lengthwise and slice crosswise 
    very thin.  Mix all.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b>.</LI>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Dressing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Massage the <b>Dressing</b> into the <b>Beef</b> and <b>Tripe</b> 
    (if using). Check seasoning to your taste. Refrigerate until needed. 
    It should have some rest before serving to adjust textures.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>Mint</b> and <b>Cilantro</b> for garnish (required), and 
    prepare any optional garnishes you please to use.</li>
  <li>Garnish as desired and serve. It's best served cool rather than 
    chilled, so give it a little warm up time from the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. 
  Shoulder is a good cut for this recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; You want a small stem here. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a stem, so this 
  recipe will need 2-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Galangal</h3> &nbsp; This board hard relative of 
  ginger imparts a unique flavor to Southeast Asian soups and stews. 
  Fresh is best but frozen is fine. Dried and powdered is not 
  acceptable. If you don't have it, use fresh Ginger Root - not at all 
  the same, but acceptable. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rau Ram:</h3> &nbsp; This important herb is available in most 
  markets serving a Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_rauramz.html"><b>Rau Ram</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; [Prik Ki Nu] This is one of the points 
  where you control the chili heat - you can use 1 to 6 chilis. The 
  amount given makes a quite mild salad by Southern California standards, 
  but use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; This is the other place where you control 
  the chili heat. Thai flake is usually made from Prik Chee Fah, so is 
  not so hot. Easily available Korean flake is a good substitute. Again, 
  this amount makes a rather mild salad by Southern California standards, 
  but use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder &amp; Flake</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Toasted Rice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for this recipe, 
  the powder is available commercially in Southeast Asian markets, but 
  is better and very easy to make yourself. See our recipe for 
  <a href="siv_ricetp1.html"><b>Toasted Rice Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page. Actually, in Laos, a 
  couple tablespoons of a very pungent murky fermented fish sauce 
  called "Padek" would be added.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Laos and Thailand they use a special 
  long, heavy, razor sharp larb knife for the chopping. A regular prep 
  knife is not nearly hefty enough for the job. I used a heavy, razor 
  sharp Chinese cleaver knife (see <a href="sgm_cowlarb1x.html#ck">
  <b>Photo</b></a>), not as good as the real thing, but it was 
  sufficient. If your arms are not real strong, you might consider 
  doing the chopping well ahead as part of the Prep section. It will 
  keep overnight in the fridge. 
  <br>When I broil the meat, it is lean and will not drip fats, so I 
  broil it on a foil tray. Some meat juices collect in the tray, which 
  I add to the dressing.</li>
