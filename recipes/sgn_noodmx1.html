This is quite the party salad, but takes real organization to produce 
efficiently. It's a project, but with careful planning can be spread 
over 3 days. Ingredients listed here are typical, but can vary.

This salad can be made completely vegetarian by using

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare SE Asian <b>Pantry Staples</b> if not on hand 
    (<a href="sgn_noodmx1.html#06"><b>Notes 7 &amp; 8</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>Tamarind Water</b>. Chop up 3 Tablespoons 
    <b>Tamarind Paste</b> and soak in 3/4 cup hot water at least 1/2 
    hour. Force through a strainer, discarding solids.</li>     
  </ol>
  <b><u>Vegies</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
  You can mix as you go.
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Place in a sauce 
    pan with water to cover and bring to a boil until just cooked 
    through. Drain and cool.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise, peel and slice crosswise about 
    1/8 inch thick. Soak in cold water for about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li>Shred <b>CABBAGE</b> about 1/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 3/8 inch.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine - seed if you don't want hot spots.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>MANGO</b> or <b>PAPAYA</b> and cut into very narrow strips 
     about 2-1/2 inches long. I use a julienning vegetable peeler.</li>
  <li>Pinch <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves from stems. Measure is loosely 
    packed.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Deep Fry</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
    <ol start="9">
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise. Peel and slice crosswise 
    very thin, and as evenly as you can for even frying.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>TOFU</b> into about 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>WONTON WRAPPERS</b> into strips about 3/8 inch wide. Don't 
    bunch them up or they'll be difficult to fry.</li>
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Shallots</b> and fry 
    stirring over declining flame until they are medium brown and almost 
    crisp. Remove to paper towels with a spider.</li>
  <li>Reserve 2 Tablespoons (1 ounce) of the <b>Oil</b> at this point.
    </li>
  <li>Bring remaining oil up over high flame. Fry <b>Tofu Cubes</b>, 
    tumbling until medium golden on the outside. Remove to paper towels 
    with spider.</li>
  <li>In small batches, scatter <b>Won Ton Strips</b> over the oil, 
    stirring them in so they don't stick together. Fry tumbling until 
    lightly browned and blistered. Keep the oil below 400&deg;F/200&deg;C 
    or they will brown unevenly. Remove to paper towels with spider.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Noodles</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="16">
  <li>Set <b>Mung Bean Noodles</b> in a bowl covered in cold water 
    for at least 20 minutes.</li>
 <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil and stir in 
    <b>Chinese Wheat Noodles</b>. Boil until cooked through, typically 
    around 7 minutes. They will cook soft, not "al dente", because they 
    are made of soft wheat. Scoop them out with a spider and quench in 
    cold water. Drain well and cut as may be appropriate.</li>
  <li>With the water back to a boil, stir in <b>Thick Rice Noodles</b> 
    until just cooked through. This can be as much as 20 minutes. Scoop 
    them out with a spider and quench in cold water. Drain well and cut 
    as may be appropriate.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Mung Bean Noodles</b> and dump into the boiling water 
    for about 30 seconds. Strain out and quench in cold water. Drain 
    well and make a couple cuts through the bunch so they are of 
    manageable length.</li>
  <li>It is OK to mix all the noodles at this point.</li> 
    </ol>
<b><u>Finish &amp; Serve</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="21">
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>In a bowl, mix or assemble as you desire, <b>All Items</b>, 
    including the <b>Reserved Oil</b> - <u>EXCEPT</u> <b>Won Ton 
    Strips</b> (see <a href="sgn_noodmx1.html#10"><b>Serving</b></a>). When ready 
    to serve, scatter <b>Won Ton Strips</b> on top of the salad.</li>
  <li>Serve cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Klondike Gold type potatoes can 
  be used as cooking time is short. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; You can use regular head cabbage, but Savoy 
  Cabbage will make fluffier shreds. You can also use Napa Cabbage, 
  which is actually a turnip green.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Mango</h3> -or- <h3>Green Papaya:</h3> &nbsp; 
  These must be really hard green. Asian markets sell them in that form 
  specifically for salad recipes. I prefer Mango, but it is not 
  always in season.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mung Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; These are the common Bean Thread 
  noodles found everywhere in little 1-1/2 to 2 ounce hanks. Just don't 
  accidently use thin Rice Noodles, which look the same dried but behave 
  much differently.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice Noodles, Large:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably 
  these are round, but if not available flat ones less than 1/4 inch 
  wide can be used. Both are usually labeled "Vietnamese style" or 
  "Pho Noodles".</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chinese Wheat Noodles</h3> &nbsp; Practically 
  any variety can be used if it isn't too wide, but I prefer not to 
  use those that are dyed a garish yellow.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Toasted Besan</h3> &nbsp; [chickpea flour]: &nbsp; This is an 
  important staple ingredient throughout Burma, but not much anywhere 
  else. It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="sip_besant1.html"><b>Toasted Chickpea Flour (Besan)</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Shrimp Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This is just dried shrimp run in a 
  spice grinder very fine. Many SE Asian recipes have you soak the 
  shrimp before pounding or processing. I consider this not needed if 
  you have a whirling blade spice grinder. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Korean is fine for a mild flake, or use 
  what you please. I usually use Indian Reshampatti or Khandela which 
  are hotter, but flavorful.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The Burmese name translates to "Hand Mixed 
  Salad", and mixing by hand gives you the best control. In fancy 
  restaurants, the components are delivered at table-side, all arranged 
  on a tray for show, and then mixed there (using utensils in North 
  America). For home use and buffet parties it can just be all mixed 
  before being set out. This is much easier and takes far fewer 
  containers and less clean-up, as you can mix during prep.</li>
