Adelightful appetizer or side dish salad, attractive flavors and 
satisfying crunch.  It can be made well ahead and dressed just before 
serving. Once dressed it is durable enough to be a buffet salad.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Soybean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; Cambodians, like 
  Koreans, favor Soy Sprouts, though the common Mung Bean sprouts 
  can be used. Korean markets around here carry bags of soy sprouts, 
  and sometimes they have them with the stringy tails cut off - the 
  way Asians like them. Those do look better, and Asians task their 
  cooperative children to pinch off the threads. Yours will probably 
  call child services if you try to wrest them away from their 
  video games and texting. The photo example was done "threads on" 
  due to time pressure.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ginger:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  "Fresh Young Ginger", but even I don't often have that. It's quite 
  available from Asian markets here in Los Angeles, but it's rather 
  perishable compared to regular ginger. I have found nice fresh 
  regular ginger works just fine if sliced very thin and into very 
  thin threads.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red ripe Fresnos, 
  but Holland Red or similar is fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tuk Trey:</h3> &nbsp; This is nearly identical to Vietnamese Nuoc 
  Cham, and will always be on hand in a Cambodian household. It is easy 
  to make by our recipe <a href="sjf_tuktrey1.html"><b>Tuk Trey</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; If you do not have this use a partially 
  refined sugar like Turbinado. Slightly different flavor but acceptable. 
  As usual, I have cut the amount of sugar in half to be more suitable 
  for Western tastes.</li>
