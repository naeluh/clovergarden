This excellent salad is made similarly to the famous 
<a href="sgv_grnpapaya1.html"><b>Green Papaya Salad</b></a>, but 
contains no Papaya. It's normally made in a large clay mortar with a 
wooden pestle. If you don't have one you'll have to improvise (see 
<a href="sgv_cukesal3.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Crush <b>PALM SUGAR</b> as fine as you can get it and soak in 
    just enough hot water to wet it. Let it sit to soften.</li>
  <li>Crumble <b>CHILIS</b> and put in just enough warm water to 
    soften them.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>CUCUMBERS</b> lengthwise, and cut the sticks diagonally 
    in lengths from 3/4 to 1 inch long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GRAPE TOMATOES</b> in half crosswise. If using larger 
    Cherry Tomatoes, cut into quarters.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>KEY LIME</b> in half lengthwise, then each half lengthwise 
    into thirds. Cut the thirds in half crosswise (12 pieces).</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> and mix with <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Fish Paste</b>.</li>
  <li>IF Used: Crush <b>PEANUTS</b> coarse.</li>
  <li>IF Used: Soak <b>RICE NOODLES</b> in warm water for 20 minutes or 
    1 hour depending on size. Drain.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Drain <b>Chilis</b>. In a Clay Mortar (see 
    <a href="sgv_cukesal3.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>) pound the <b>Chilis</b>, 
    <b>Garlic</b> and <b>Palm Sugar</b> until you have a sludge 
    with tiny flakes of Garlic and Chili.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Chunks</b> and bruise them just enough to release
    juice. Stir in <b>Shrimp</b> and crush them lightly.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Long Beans</b> and pound them gently until bruised. They 
    are fairly tough but don't hit them hard enough to break them apart 
    or flatten them.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cucumbers</b> and <b>Lime Juice mix</b>. Pound to just 
    bruise the Cucumbers. Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and bruise very gently. 
    Stir in <b>Peanuts</b> if used. Let sit for awhile to blend flavors.
    </li>
  <li>IF Used: Bring plenty of water to a boil. Stir in the <b>Rice 
    Noodles</b> for just a few seconds if thin, not much longer if 
    thicker. Pour into a strainer and refresh with cold water.
  <li>Put some <b>Rice Noodles</b> in each of individual bowls. Spoon 
    some salad over, with its share of the liquid. Serve cool but 
    not chilled.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible these 
  should be narrow cucumbers that don't need to be peeled or seeded 
  (Persian, Japanese, etc.). If all you have is standard green blimps,  
  peel and seed them before weighing.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chili Dried:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; Issan food 
  tends to have plenty of chili heat. This number of very hot dried red 
  Thai chilis makes this dish distinctly hot even by Southern California 
  standards. If you haven't yet made your sacrifices to the Chili gods, 
  adjust to suit. If you don't have dried Thai chilis, de Arbols are a 
  good substitute. Fresh red Thai chilis could also be used, but dried 
  are common in Issan. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; About 2 teaspoons after softening. This 
  flavorful sugar can be found in any market serving a Southeast Asian 
  community, and in some Indian markets. If you don't have palm sugar, 
  use an amber sugar like Turbinado.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lime Juice:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for juice of Key 
  Limes. If not available, it suggests mixing a little Meyer Lemon (sweet 
  lemon) juice in with regular Lime Juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Paste:</h3> &nbsp; [Mam Nem (Viet); Naam Pla Raa (Thai)] 
  &nbsp; This is a pungent paste-like fish sauce. Look for it under 
  Mam Nem in tall 7 ounce bottles. It should contain no sugar, just 
  fish, salt and water. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfishsauce.html#other"><b>Fish Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally a large fired clay mortar 
  (<a href="../ke/mortar.html#kruk"><b>Kruk</b></a>) with a wood pestle 
  is used to make this and similar salads. If you don't have that, you'll 
  have to improvise. When using this mortar, you do not strike the pestle 
  straight up and down, but at an angle so it hits the top edge of the 
  contents. You tumble the contents with a spoon to bring more material 
  up to the strike zone.</li>
