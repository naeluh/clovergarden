Green Papaya Salads are perhaps the most famous of Thai salads, also 
popular in Vietnam and Laos. This version is a crunchy and very 
flavorful presentation salad.  For a simpler version, see 
<a href="sgv_grnpapaya2.html"><b>Green Papaya Salad #2</b></a>.

These salads are normally made in a large clay mortar with a wooden 
pestle, using a special technique. If you don't have one of these 
mortars,you'll have to improvise (see <a href="sgv_grnpapaya1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Papaya:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after peeling and cutting. 
  These are fully unripe papayas. The seeds within are still mostly 
  white and the flesh is a very pale green. I have successfully 
  used papayas that had some traces of pink blush at the center around 
  fully black seeds. Green papayas are widely available in markets 
  serving Southeast Asian communities, particularly Filipino. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/br_papaz.html"><b>Papayas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Red or Green can be used. 
  In northern Thailand and Laos 6 or more chilis might be used, but 3 
  chilis makes it decently spicy by Southern California standards. If 
  you're uncertain you may want to cut it back to 2. Fresh de Arbols are 
  the best substitute. Serranos can be used but cut the quantity in half 
  because, though not as hot, they're much larger. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Soaking pulp from a block 
  provides the best flavor. Use 3 T from the block, chop it, add hot 
  water to just cover and let it sit 20 minutes or so. Force it through 
  a wire strainer until only fibers remain. Second best is 3 T from a 
  jar of concentrate. For details and method, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; This flavorful sugar can be found in any 
  market catering to a Southeast Asian community, and in some Indian 
  markets. If you don't have it, use an amber sugar like Turbinado.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Roasted Peanuts:</h3> &nbsp; These would be dry pan roasted 
  peanuts, quite different in flavor and texture from commercially 
  roasted peanuts. See our recipe 
  <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally a very large clay mortar with a 
  wood pestle is used to make this salad. The pounding is not straight 
  up and down, but rather at the upper edge of the contents, bruising it 
  against the side of the mortar. A spoon is used to continuously bring 
  ingredients up from the bottom to where the pestle strikes. For details 
  see our <a href="../ke/mortar.html#kruk"><b>Mortar &amp; Pestle</b></a> 
  page.  If you don't have one of these, you will have to improvise, 
  probably pounding the individual ingredients in smaller batches and 
  then mixing all. You can spread ingredients out on your cutting board 
  and pound them gently with your kitchen mallet.</li>
