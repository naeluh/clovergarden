The popular Yum Salat is also called Luang Prabang Salad for where it 
originated, the seat of Lao kings and French governors. It's a French / 
Lao fusion recipe, and one of a very few completely vegetarian Laotian 
dishes.

  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (Do ahead by recipes)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the <b>Shallot Oil</b>, <b>Fried Shallots</b> and 
  <b>Roasted Peanuts</b> if using.</li>
  <li>Hard Cook <b>EGGS</b>. See our recipe 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> for best method. 
    Cool thoroughly.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Quarter <b>Eggs</b> and separate Yolks from Whites, reserving both. 
    Slice the white quarters crosswise about 1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Cut stiff stem ends from <b>LETTUCE LEAVES</b> and cut or tear 
    into largish salad size pieces.</li>
  <li>Discard oversize stems from <b>WATERCRESS</b> and break up into 
    salad size pieces.</li>
  <li>Separate leaves from stems of <b>CILANTRO</b> and <b>MINT</b>. 
    Measure is lightly packed. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBERS</b> fairly thin.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GRAPE TOMATOES</b> in half. If using larger Cherry Tomatoes, 
    cut into quarters lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Salad Items</b> and include the <b>Egg Whites</b>.</li>
  <li>Mash the <b>Egg Yolks</b> fine. Mix together all <b>Dressing 
    items</b>. Place in a small jar so the dressing can be shaken 
    vigorously before pouring it over salad.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, shake the <b>Dressing</b> vigorously and 
    pour over the <b>Salad</b>. Tumble well to coat.</li> 
  <li>For serving you will have to treat this as a Composed Salad - 
    because the Egg Whites, Cucumbers and Tomatoes immediately drop to 
    the bottom of the mixing bowl and don't come back up. Fill serving 
    bowls most of the way with greens, then shovel up some of the 
    other ingredients and add on top. Use the <b>Garnishes</b> to 
    decorate the top or they can be mixed in. See also 
    <a href="sgv_luapra1.html#07"><b>Comments</b></a> in the notes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lettuce Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These should be of 
  a very crisp variety. Many recipes call for Iceberg Lettuce, which 
  I used in the photo example, but I actually prefer to use Romaine.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use 
  small cucumbers that don't need to be skinned or seeded, such as 
  Persian, Japanese or European. If you have only the standard waxed 
  green blimps, peel them and seed them, then measure out the given 
  weight.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Shallot Oil:</h3> Our recipe 
  <a href="siv_shalfry1.html"><b>Fried Shallots / Shallot Oil</b></a> 
  makes both the Shallot garnish and the Oil called for in this recipe. 
  Some recipes call for Garlic Oil, which is made the exact same way.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Asians tend to use too much 
  sugar for Western tastes (and health). As usual, I've cut the amount 
  of sugar in half, and find that is plenty. Adjust to your own taste.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Peanuts, Dry Roasted</h3> &nbsp; These peanuts, widely used as 
  a garnish in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, are quite different in 
  flavor and texture from commercially roasted peanuts. See our 
  recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>. 
  This garnish may be omitted by preference or in response to allergies.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If this salad is let stand for a while, the 
  lettuce will wilt and the dressing will become more dilute. It is 
  reported that this is the way it is most often served 
  in Laos, and I read one comment that this was the way it was originally 
  made and served in Laos - that serving it crisp is more "Frenchified".
  That person said his family made it in huge quantity, and on days it 
  was served, the meal would consist only of the salad and rice.
