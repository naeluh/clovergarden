<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweet Potato Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; [Yam Leaves] &nbsp; These are 
  available from Asian markets, particularly Philippine markets. A 14 
  ounce bundle of vines will yield 6 to 8 ounces of leaves with leaf 
  stems attached, depending on how much of the bundle is vines. 6 ounces 
  is adequate for this recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_spleafz.html"><b>Sweet Potato Leaves</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="02"><h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use one of the 
  fine Philippine natural cane vinegars, though coconut or palm vinegar 
  would be fine too. If Philippine vinegars are not available, use a good 
  Rice Vinegar. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
  <b>Vinegars and Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page. If you are a strict vegetarian, 
  and have made our <a href="sjv_vegfish1.html"><b>Vegetarian Fish Sauce 
  - Clear</b></a>, use it, otherwise replace it with a little more salt.</li>
