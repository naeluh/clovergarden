  <p>This recipe is sized for a 1/2 gallon kimchee jar with 17 large 
    chicken eggs. Naturally, for Duck Eggs fewer will fit into the 
    jar, but the amount of brine should still be enough.</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (30 days - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Carefully check all <b>Eggs</b> for cracks. Reject any with the 
    slightest amount of crack. Very carefully place them in the jar.
    </li>
  <li>Bring <b>Water</b> to a boil over high heat and pour in 
    <b>Salt</b>. Keep at a slow boil until as much salt as will dissolve 
    has dissolved. When you see a little crust forming on top, you know 
    you have a saturate solution. Let it cool to <u>room temperature</u>. 
    </li>
  <li>Pour cooled <b>Brine</b> into the jar, along with any salt crystals 
    that have ptecipitated from the water. Make sure the eggs are 
    completely covered. If needed, stuff a water filled and tightly 
    sealed plastic bag on top of the eggs.</li>
  <li>Label the jar with today's date. Set in a cool place for about 30 
    days. You can cook an egg  to see if they are done - 26 days for 
    Chicken Eggs, 30 days for Duck Eggs. Place in a pan of water, bring 
    to a boil and simmer 15 minutes (20 minutes for Duck Eggs).The yolk 
    should be dark orange, stiff, and oily in the center. </li>
  <li>When done, remove the eggs from the brine and place in an egg 
    carton. It is said they will keep longer raw than cooked, but in 
    any case, use them within 1 month.</li> 
    </ol> 
  <b><u>Cooking</u></b>
    <br>Most, but not all, recipes call for the eggs to be cooked.
    <ol start="6">
  <li>Place in a pan of <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 
    15 minutes for Chicken Eggs, 20 minutes for Duck Eggs.
  <li>Place in an egg carton and refrigerate. If you are keeping mixed 
    eggs, mark the cooked ones (red is the traditional mark color).</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Make sure they're fresh. For Chicken Eggs, 
  Large, Extra Large or Jumbo are fine. Duck Eggs, whatever size you 
  can get. For details, see our <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html">
  <b>Eggs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Natural sea salt, pickling salt, or Diamond Crystal 
  kosher salt are all good. The brine can be reused for another batch 
  after it has been reboiled.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; This is supposed to help the eggs get 
  firm and oily. Does it work? I don't know, but I use it as I always 
  have plenty on hand and the cost is almost nothing. Use a good 
  drinkable Rice Wine, not that horrid salted "cooking wine". For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Cooked, the white is very tender and tastes 
  like <u>very</u> salty boild egg white. Many recipes don't use it, but 
  it may replace salt in some recipes. The yolk will cook quite firm and 
  a bit crumbly. It will be much less salty, rather small, and somewhat 
  oily, with a unique flavor. Best to peel these eggs cold, but they 
  still don't peel well at all. That doesn't matter - if the whites are 
  used they are chopped. </li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Variations:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>The whites can get quite salty by time the yolk is salty enough. 
      one recipe calls for using 1/4 cup Salt to 4 cups Water and 
      brining for 60 days (Duck Eggs, 50 days for Chicken) to make the 
      saltiness more even.</li>
    <li>Some recipes add spices to the jar with the eggs: 4 Star Anise, 
      1 Tablespoon Sichuan Peppercorns, 3 inches Cinnamon Bark, and 
      possibly 2 Black Cardamom - or as you desire.</li>
  </ul></li>
