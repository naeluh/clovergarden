Making Rice Cake is easy. It takes a lot of time - but only little of 
your time. It's best to make the cake the day before you will use it.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place all <b>Dry Items</b> in a large mixing bowl and mix well, 
    breaking up any lumps. Whisk in <b>Water</b> until smooth, Let 
    sit for about 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Lightly grease a suitable mold. It can be round or rectangular, 
    but must comfortably hold 5 cups of liquid. Set up a steamer that 
    the mold will fit into. I use a coverable wok with a steamer rack, 
    which can easily accommodate various sizes and shapes of mold (see 
    <a href="sin_ricak1x.html#gallery"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>).</li>
  <li>After its long rest, whip up <b>Flour Mix</b> and place in a 
    saucepan. Stir over very moderate heat until it just starts to 
    thicken - then pour into your lightly oiled mold.</li>
  <li>Place your filled mold in the steamer. Bring the water up to 
    a boil <u>uncovered</u>. When boiling well, tightly fit the lid 
    over it. Steam over medium high flame until done - this will take 
    1 to 1-1/2 hours depending on thickness of your cake. Check 
    often to see it doesn't run out of water. You can test for 
    doneness with a pointy chopstick or wooden skewer through the 
    center. If it feels firm all the way through and comes out clean 
    (with, perhaps a few tiny crumbles), the cake is done, otherwise, 
    give it more time.</li>
  <li>Set it aside to cool. When it's thoroughly cool, tip it out on  
    your cutting board and cut as needed for your use. Once it is cool, 
    it needs to be wrapped in plastic or otherwise protected against 
    drying. If it will be used the next day, it is best to leave it at 
    room temperature, but refrigeration will not seriously harm it for 
    use frying for B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Flour:</h3> &nbsp; You want regular Rice Flour, not Glutinous 
  Rice Flour. This is easily available in any market serving a Southeast 
  Asian or Chinese community. It is normally packed in 1 pound plastic 
  bags, usually red for regular and green for glutinous. It can be found 
  in markets serving a Southeast Asian or Chinese community, and in many 
  multi-ethnic markets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tapioca Starch:</h3> &nbsp; This is included in most Vietnamese 
  rice noodles, as it makes for a firmer, chewier noodle. It is available 
  in the same type 1 pound bags as the rice flour, and in other packages 
  in most markets. Recipes vary in how much to use.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This cake has a somewhat different texture 
  than commercial cakes I have used. It is superior to the commercial 
  cakes for B&aacute;nh B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n, frying crisp on both sides 
  in under 10 minutes, where commercial cakes have taken a little to a 
  lot longer, and splattered more. On the other hand, the interior will 
  be somewhat more firm than with the commercial.</li>
