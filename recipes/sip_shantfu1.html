This dish would better be called "Shan Polenta" as it is 
similarly made. Extremely easy to make, it's a versatile ingredient, 
deep fried on its own or used in salads, soups, etc. &nbsp;

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min + 1 hr to 8 hrs cooling time)
  <ol>
  <li>Lightly oil a suitable mold. I use an 11 x 7 inch glass baking 
    dish.</li>
  <li>Place <b>BESAN</b> in a large mixing bowl, preferably through 
    a sifter. Whisk it around to make sure there are no lumps, then 
    mix in <b>Salt</b> and whisk some more.</li>
  <li>Stir in 2 cups <b>Water</b> and whisk it well to assure there 
    are not lumps at all.</li>
  <li>In a wide, heavy bottomed pot (I use a 5 quart tri-ply saut&eacute; 
    pan), bring 4 cups <b>Water</b> to a boil over fairly high flame.
    With a flat spatula, stir constantly as you slowly mix in the 
    <b>Besan mix</b>. Lower the heat a little and keep stirring and 
    scraping up the bottom of the pan until the mixture is smooth 
    and has a silky appearance (about 5 minutes). It will start to 
    thicken immediately. I regulate the heat so I see just a couple 
    of bubbles at the end of the 5 minutes of stirring.</li>
  <li>Pour into the prepared mold and smooth out. This is best done 
    by two people, one to hold the pan, the other with a rubber spatula 
    scooting it out into the mold. Especially with our 2-1/2 cup formula 
    it's setting fast, so there's no room for delay.</li>
  <li>Set it aside to cool (don't put hot things in your fridge). When 
    pretty cool, slide it into the fridge to set. Don't cover with 
    plastic for awhile as it will exude some water at first.</li>
  <li>Turn out on your cutting board and cut as needed for your use.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Besan:</h3> &nbsp; [Chickpea Flour] &nbsp; Besan 
  can be found in markets serving a South Asian community and in many 
  multi-ethnic markets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Consisitency</h3> &nbsp; Made with 2 cups of Besan, this recipe 
  will set to the consistency of Silken Tofu in an hour or so, and be 
  like Soft Tofu in the morning. Made with 2-1/2 cups of Besan, it will 
  set to Firm Tofu consistency before it even gets into the fridge. It 
  will be excellent for deep frying, salad pieces, or cut into noodles. 
  For Silky Shan Soup you'd want to start with 1-1/4 cup Basan.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This "Tofu" has become popular throughout 
  Burma, but in central Burma cooks would usually add 1/4 teaspoon of 
  Turmeric for a yellow color. Making Shan Tofu from Besan is a 
  convenience for people who have that available. In The Shan Hills it 
  is often made from Mung Beans or Pigeon Peas. Without access to flour, 
  they boil the beans soft, then grind them into a mush that will set 
  into the "Tofu".
