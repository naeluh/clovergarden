This fermented soybean paste, and dried disks made from it, are very 
important to the Shan people of Burma. They use it similarly to how 
Shrimp Paste is used in Thailand and the non-Shan regions of Burma. 
It can also serve the same way for strict vegetarians. Imported disks 
can be ordered from Yoma Myanmar Tea Co., but are much less expensive 
made at home.

  <li>Place <b>SOYBEANS</b> in a pot with <u>lots</u> of water. Bring to 
    a boil and hold at a fast simmer for 3 to 3-1/2 hours until cooked 
    through.</li>
  <li>Place cooked <b>Soybeans</b> in a fermenting container. In Burma 
    a basket is often used, but I have used a Mexican clay bowl 
    (see <a href="sip_tuanao1x.html"><b>Gallery</b></a>). If you 
    have a little powder from a previous batch it could get the 
    fermentation going more quickly. While my first batch was made with 
    wild fermentation, the photo specimens used powder from disks 
    imported from Burma.</li>
  <li>Place in a spot away from sunlight, cover with a cloth and keep 
    damp for 5 to 6 days (depending on room temperature). Using the 
    clay bowl, I make sure there's a little water at the bottom and 
    stir them up twice a day, renewing the water as needed. You must 
    not let them dry out on top or you won't be able to grind them at 
    all easily. For the last night I stir them again and cover with 
    a plate to hold in moisture to make sure all are evenly soft.</li>
  <li>When the <b>Soybeans</b> are properly fermented, they will have 
    a fairly strong slightly sweet fermented smell, but must not smell 
    rotten or show any signs of mold.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Salt</b> and grind the <b>Soybeans</b> to paste. This is 
    best done in a powerful food processor, adding no water or just 
    enough so it can make them into a uniform paste. Scrape down 
    the sides often. Too much water and you'll have a hard time making 
    disks, if that is what you intend.</li>
  <li>Store paste in a tightly covered jar in the fridge. It will keep 
    for a week, maybe two - or - make into dried disks.</li>

  <li>You will need two sheets of plastic, about 6 inches square and 
    about the thickness of a large Ziploc bag. You will also need a 
    drying rack with a fairly small grid. I use the trays from my 
    dehydrator.
  <li>Set one sheet of plastic on a flat surface. I find it difficult 
    to get disks off the bottom sheet, so I wipe it with a paper towel 
    lightly wetted with Olive Oil before making each disk - there should 
    be no visible oil. If you have trouble with the top sheet, do the 
    same there.</li>
  <li>Make a ball of the Tua Nao Paste about the size of an English 
    Walnut. Set it on the bottom plastic sheet.</li>
  <li>Place the top plastic sheet over the ball and squeeze it down 
    carefully to make a disk about 3-1/4 inches in diameter, or however 
    works with your paste.</li>
  <li>Carefully peel off the top plastic sheet.</li>
  <li>Carry the disk to the drying rack on the bottom sheet, then 
    quickly invert it onto the rack. Carefully peel off the sheet of 
    plastic.</li>
  <li>Repeat until you have as many disks as you want, or run out of 
    Paste or drying rack space.</li>
  <li>Normally, these racks are set out to sun dry the disks. This will 
    take a couple of days (take them in at night).  Using my dehydrator, 
    I set it at fan on and low heat, leaving it run for a day and a 
    night. The disks need to be very dry and brittle. Don't worry if 
    they crack, you'll be pulverizing them for use anyway.</li>
  <li>To use the disks, just run pieces to powder in your spice grinder. 
    Most recipes will ask you to toast the disk over flame or on a 
    dry pan before grinding. I dry pan toast until just slightly darker. 
    Each will have the power of the number of Tablespoons of paste used 
    to make it.</li>

  <b>Soybeans:</b> &nbsp; These should be dried 
  white soybeans, preferably from a Korean market or some other 
  market that as a high turnover to assure freshness.</li>
