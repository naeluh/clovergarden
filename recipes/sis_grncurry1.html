This is the hottest of the Thai curry pastes and used with abandon in a 
number of famous dishes. A third cup of chopped Thai green chilis seem 
rather a lot to you? Well, yes - we're not making baby food here!

  <u>All volume measures are after chopping small</u>.  This paste is 
  traditionally made by pounding in a large stone mortar, and that's still 
  really the best way for parts. See <a href="sis_grncurry1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Separately dry fry <b>CORIANDER</b> and <b>CUMIN</b> until quite 
    fragrant and darkening just slightly, then cool and grind in a spice 
    mill along with <b>Peppercorns</b>. Do this first, because after the 
    chilis your nose may not work well for awhile.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GALANGAL</b> if needed, and slice very thin. Slice into 
    fine threads, then slice the threads crosswise into tiny bits. Pound 
    to thin flakes in the mortar. Pour out into a bowl separate from the 
    spice mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>LIME PEEL</b> into tiny bits and pound as with the 
    Galangal. Add to the Galangal mix.</li>
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, cut off hard root 
    end and pound thoroughly with the smooth side of your kitchen mallet - 
    then slice crosswise as thin as you can for about 4 to 5 inches from 
    the root end. Pound to thin flakes in the mortar and add to the 
    Galangal.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO ROOT</b> (or stems) fine. Pound to thin flakes 
    (and/or pulp) in the mortar, then add to the Galangal mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very thin. Chop <b>CHILI LEAVES</b> (if used). 
    Mix and put in a separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Crush, <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Pound both to a pulp in the mortar, then scrape into 
    a bowl separate from the other ingredients.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>Galangal mix</b> in your mini-prep food processor (a 
    blender will also work but is too noisy for my taste) until it's as 
    fine as it's going to get.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Chili mix</b>. continue to process until finely blended. You 
    may need to stop and scrape down the sides a few times.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Shallot mix</b> and continue to process, but now it's going 
    to be sticky so you definitely need to stop and scrape down the sides 
    frequently.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Shrimp Paste</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Spice mix</b> and 
    continue to process (scraping down the sides) until evenly mixed.</li>
  <li>You should now have a rather dry but fairly smooth paste. Pack in 
    a 6 oz jar. Stored tightly sealed in the refrigerator it will last 
    for months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't get it fresh or 
  frozen, don't use dry - it has little flavor. Use fresh ginger instead 
  - way different taste but it has taste. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime:</h3> &nbsp; if you don't have any use 
  grated zest of a regular lime (no white). Not the same but better than 
  nothing. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro Roots:</h3> &nbsp; These are difficult to 
  get even in Southern California, so you may have to use stems - include 
  no leaves.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Unfortunately, Thai chilis here in Southern 
  California are often disappointingly mild, so I end up using 1/2 cup. 
  Use your own best judgement here - but 1/4 cup would be the absolute 
  minimum.  If you can't get Thai chilis, green de Arbols are a decent 
  substitute. Serranos can be used but the flavor will be a bit different 
  - I wouldn't worry, they grow Serranos (Prik e noo kaset) in Thailand 
  now. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chili</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are sometimes used, but not 
  required. They just make the paste much greener. When I made the batch 
  in the photo above, I had no dark green chili plants 
  that could spare leaves, so I used a very dark green Chili Poblano. 
  Fresh or frozen chili leaves can often be found in Philippine markets.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably Thai shrimp 
  paste, which is a bit more refined than most. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I have carefully developed the above sequence 
  to get the best results with the least effort and mess. For best 
  results you need a <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ke/mortar.html"><b>Thai Granite 
  Mortar</b></a> or similar with a heavy pestle. "Gourmet" and 
  standard kitchen mortars are totally inadequate (for practically any 
  use, actually). My granite mortar is 7-3/4 inches across with a 5-1/2 
  inch diameter bowl and a 3 pound pestle. If you don't have such a 
  device (then order one now), you can get by with just the mini-prep 
  processor or blender, but the texture will be a little grainy. I have 
  also made this by grinding the ingredients in the mini-prep first, 
  adding them in the order given, then pounding the finished sauce in 
  the big stone mortar. Both methods worked fine.</li>
