A very popular curry paste in Cambodia, used as the base flavoring for 
many soups and stir frys. It is not very hot but it certainly isn't 
bland either.

  This paste is made by pounding in a large stone mortar. Mine is 7 
  inches across (5-1/2 inch bowl) with a 3 pound pestel - much less is 
  inadequate - but I do cheat and use a mini food processor for the 
  initial grinding before I pound it in the mortar. Start with the 
  hardest ingredients and work to the softest. You can add a little 
  water if necessary while processing and pounding but 2 T max.
  <p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Peel tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. Pound to shreads with your kitchen mallet and slice the 
    bottom 4 inches crosswise very thin. Pound to pulp in a mortar or run 
    in the mini processor.</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>KAFFIR LEAVES</b> and slice into thin shreds from the 
    outside to the spine, then from the other side. Discard the spine and 
    chop the threads very fine. Pound to a pulp.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GALLANGAL</b> and slice very thin. Pound well with your 
    kitchen mallet and chop very fine. Pound to a pulp.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TURMERIC ROOT</b>, flatten with your kitchen mallet and 
    chop fine. Pound to a pulp.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b>, slice and chop small. When you can see again 
    pound to a pulp.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Add to the mortar and 
    pound to a pulp.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Salt</b> and pound all the ingredients thoroughly.You should 
    now have a rather dry but smooth paste. Pack in a 7 oz jar. Stored 
    tightly closed in the refrigerator it will keep for a week or so, or 
    freeze it for longer storage.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a stem. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> 
  page. If you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you 
  squeeze them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Galingal:</h3> If you can't get it fresh, don't use dry - it has 
  little flavor. Use fresh ginger instead - different taste but closer.
  </li>
<li id="03"><b>Turmeric Root</b> &nbsp; This should be fresh yellow 
  root, not the white. It can be found in markets serving Indian or 
  Southeast Asian communities. You can freeze what you don't need right 
  away. If you have to use  dry turmeric powder use about 1 teaspoon.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_turmerz.html">
