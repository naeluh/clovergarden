The most time consuming of Thai curry pastes, but made fairly dry, and 
with the amount of salt given, it keeps for months in the fridge. This 
recipe makes enough for about 6 dinners for four

This curry paste is a Thai interpretation of the highly aromatic Mughal 
cuisine of Hyderabad in India (Mussamun (variously spelled) = Muslim). 
Unlike the Mughal cuisine of northern India, Hycerabad adopted coconut 
and tamarind, making it more compatible with Thailand.

  This recipe is traditionally made by pounding in a big stone mortar, 
  but I find a mini-prep food processor helps cut down on pounding time. 
  See <a href="sis_masmcurry1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for details.  If you don't have the 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ke/mortar.html"><b>Big Stone Mortar</b></a> (so why don't 
  you?) you'll have to settle for a somewhat more grainy paste.
  <ol>
  <li>Separately dry fry <b>CUMIN</b> and <b>CORIANDER</b> until quite 
    fragrant and darkening just slightly, then cool well and grind in a 
    spice grinder.  Do Cumin first as it's easiest to tell when the pan 
    gets hot enough, and do both before the chilis which may affect your 
    nose for awhile.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>All Other Spices</b> and mix with with Cumin/Coriander.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>CHILIS</b>, run to powder in your spice grinder and mix with 
    spices.</li>
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, cut off hard root 
    end and pound well with your kitchen mallet. Slice the bottom 4 inches 
    crosswise as thin as you can and chop fine, then run in the mini-prep.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> very thin crosswise and chop fine. Run in the 
    mini-prep.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine and run in the mini-prep.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Do not run in the mini-prep, 
    it's too sticky.</li>
  <li>Pound and/or grind <b>All Ingredients</b> together into a thick 
    dryish paste.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; Measure is crumbled medium. Dried 
  Thai chilis are plenty hot. If you don't have them substitute dried 
  de Arbols and use a little more. If you have only Japones use at least 
  twice as much. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Lemon Grass:</b> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North America in markets that serve an East or Southeast 
  Asian community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Shrimp Paste:</b> &nbsp; Preferably use real Thai shrimp paste, 
  which is rather civilized compared to the rude products of 
  surrounding countries. for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Paste</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Procedure:</b> &nbsp; I like my curry pastes rather 
  paste-like, so here's my exact process:
  <ol>
  <li>Do the spices and Chilis as above and set aside.</li>
  <li>Do Lemon Grass as above, run in mini-prep as fine as it'll go, then 
    pound well in the big granite mortar. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Do Galangal and Shallots as above, run in the mini-prep, then pound 
    in the mortar.</li>
  <li>Crush Garlic through a garlic press and chop fine. Add to the mortar 
    (it'll just clog the mini-prep) and pound well.</li>
  <li>Add the Lemon Grass back and pound until blended, then add the spice 
    mix and pound until blended. No additional liquid is needed.</li>
  </ol>
