In Thailand, this brick red curry paste is used more than any 
other. In hotness it's midway between the 
<a href="sis_yellowcurry1.html"><b>Yellow Curry Paste</b></a> and the 
<a href="sis_grncurry1.html"><b>Green Curry Paste</b></a>, so making it 
involves less suffering than the green.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Note: you will have fits of sneezing at certain points - this is normal 
- just tough it out. While some curry pastes are available commercially, 
what is commonly available in North American markets is "Red Curry Sauce", 
unsuitable for Thai Recipes - see our page 
<a href="../ingred/sa_thairz.html"><b>Thai Red Curry Paste vs. 
Sauces</b></a>.

  <u>All volume measures are after chopping small</u> (chilis after 
  breaking up a bit).  This paste is traditionally made by pounding in 
  a large stone mortar, and that's still really the best way for parts. 
  See <a href="sis_redcurry1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Separately dry fry <b>CUMIN</b> and <b>CORIANDER</b> until quite 
    fragrant and darkening just slightly, then cool and grind in your 
    spice grinder along with <b>Peppercorns</b>. Do this first because 
    the chilis may affect your nose.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>THAI CHILIS</b> to powder in your spice grinder and add 
    to the spice mix. Break the <b>CALIFORNIA CHILIS</b> open and spill 
    out the seeds - then break them up, grind to a powder and add to the 
    Spice Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GALANGAL</b> if needed, and slice very thin. Slice into 
    fine threads, then slice the threads crosswise into tiny bits. Pound 
    to thin flakes in the mortar. Pour out into a bowl separate from the 
    spice mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>LIME PEEL</b> into tiny bits and pound as with the 
    Galangal. Add to the Galangal mix.</li>
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, cut off hard root 
    end and pound thoroughly with the smooth side of your kitchen mallet - 
    then slice crosswise as thin as you can for about 4 to 5 inches from 
    the root end. Pound to thin flakes in the mortar and add to the 
    Galangal.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO ROOT</b> (if using stems use 1 T instead of 1 t) 
    fine. Pound to thin flakes (and/or pulp) in the mortar, then add to 
    the Galangal mix.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> very thin 
    and chop fine. Pound both to a pulp in the mortar, then scrape into 
    a third bowl separate from the other two.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>Galangal mix</b> in your mini-prep food processor (a 
    blender will also work but is too noisy for my taste) until it's as 
    fine as it's going to get.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Shallot mix</b> and continue to process, but now it's going 
    to be sticky so you need to stop and scrape down the sides frequently.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Shrimp Paste</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Spice mix</b> and 
    continue to process (scraping down the sides) until evenly mixed.</li>
  <li>You should now have a rather dry paste. Pack in a 6 oz jar. 
    Stored tightly sealed in the refrigerator it will last for months.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis, Thai:</h3> &nbsp; The half cup is for 
  whole dry chilis, but break really long ones in half for more accurate 
  measure. Dry red Thai chilis are quite hot so for a substitute you need 
  something like de Arbols (make that a heaping half cup). If you can 
  only get the common Japones use at least twice as much. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis, California:</h3> &nbsp; These dried chilis are mostly for 
  color, so New Mexico or Gujillo will also work, or 6 or 7 Puyas, which 
  are closest to a chili used in Thailand.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't get it fresh or 
  frozen, don't use dry - it has little flavor. Use fresh ginger instead 
  - way different taste but better. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime:</h3> &nbsp; if you don't have any,
  use grated zest of a regular lime (no white). Not the same but better 
  than nothing. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cilantro Roots:</h3> &nbsp; These are difficult to get even in 
  Southern California, so you may have to use stems - include no leaves.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably Thai shrimp 
  paste, which is a bit more refined than most. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I have carefully developed the 
  above sequence to get the best results with the least effort and mess.  
  For best results you need a <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ke/mortar.html"><b>Thai 
  Granite Mortar</b></a> or similar with a heavy pestle. "Gourmet" and 
  standard kitchen mortars are totally inadequate (for practically any 
  use, actually). My granite mortar is 7-3/4 inches across with a 5-1/2 
  inch diameter bowl and a 3 pound pestle. If you don't have such a 
  device (then order one now), you can get by with just the mini-prep 
  processor or blender, but the texture will be a little grainy. I have 
  also made this by grinding the ingredients in the mini-prep first, 
  adding them in the order given, then pounding the finished sauce in 
  the big stone mortar. Both methods worked fine.</li>
