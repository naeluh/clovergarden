This is the mildest of the Thai curries. Actually a Thai interpretation 
of the curries of southern India, and probably similar to how curry was 
made in India before dried spices came into general use there.

  This recipe is traditionally made by pounding in a big stone mortar, 
  but I find a mini-prep food processor helps cut down on pounding time. 
  See <a href="sis_yellowcurry1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for details.  If you don't have the 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ke/mortar.html"><b>Big Stone Mortar</b></a> (so why don't 
  you?) you'll have to settle for a somewhat more grainy paste.
  <ol>
  <li>Separately dry fry <b>CUMIN</b> and <b>CORIANDER</b> until quite 
    fragrant and darkening just slightly, then cool well. Grind in a spice 
    grinder and mix with <b>TURMERIC</b>. Do Cumin first as it's easiest to 
    tell when the pan gets hot enough, and do both before the chilis which 
    may affect your nose for awhile.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>CHILIS</b>, run to powder in your spice grinder and mix with 
    spices.</li>
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, cut off hard root 
    end and pound well with your kitchen mallet. Slice the bottom 4 inches 
    crosswise as thin as you can and chop fine, then run in the mini-prep.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and chop fine. Run in the 
    mini-prep.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine and run in the mini-prep.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Do not run in the mini-prep, 
    it's too sticky.</li>
  <li>Pound and/or grind <b>All Ingredients</b> together into a thick 
    dryish paste.</li>
  <li>Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in the refrigerator. Made rather 
    dry, as in the photo, and with the given amount of salt, it will keep 
    for months.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is crumbled small. 
  Dried Thai chilis are plenty hot. If you don't have them substitute 
  dried de Arbols and use a little more. If you have only Japones use at 
  least twice as much. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com//ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use real Thai 
  shrimp paste, which is rather civilized compared to the rude products of 
  surrounding countries. for details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Procedure:</h3> &nbsp; I like my curry pastes rather 
  paste-like, so here's my exact process:
  <ol>
  <li>Do the spices and Chilis as above and set aside.</li>
  <li>Do Lemon Grass as above, run in mini-prep as fine as it'll go, then 
    pound well in the big granite mortar. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Do Ginger and Shallots as above, run in the mini-prep, then pound in 
    the mortar.</li>
  <li>Crush Garlic through a garlic press and chop fine. Add to the mortar 
    (it'll just clog the mini-prep) and pound well.</li>
  <li>Add the Lemon Grass back and pound until blended, then add the spice 
    mix and pound until blended. No additional liquid is needed.</li>
  </ol>
