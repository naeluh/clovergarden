  <b><u>PREP:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Select a small, heavy bottomed sauce pan, multiply stainless or 
    enameled iron. It is important the inside is light in color so you 
    can judge color. You will also need a wood or metal spatula with 
    which to scrape the bottom of the pan.</li>
  <li>Set out a shallow pan of cold water so that when the sauce pan 
    is set in it, the water will come up about 1/3 on its sides. This 
    is a quench to instantly stop the cooking at just the right point.
    </li></ol>
  <b><u>RUN:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In the saucepan, put the <b>Sugar</b> and 1/4 c <b>Water</b>.
    Heat over very moderate heat, stirring until the sugar is evenly 
    dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Now leave it alone.</li>
  <li>The Sugar should soon start to bubble a little at the edges, 
    then more bubbling into the center. If the heat is right, it should 
    bubble enthusiastically, but not angrily.</li>
  <li>Eventually, in 25 to 30 minutes, it should form a hard crust, 
    then become all crusty. You will now see the Sugar beginning to melt. 
    You can stir it up a little at this point, breaking up the crust 
    so it melts evenly. Watch it with care.</li>
  <li>The Sugar will darken. When it is nearing coffee color, you will 
    see a few wisps of smoke. <u>Immediately</u> take the pan off the 
    heat and stir continuously, watching the color with care. When it 
    achieves a reddish coffee color, set the pan into the waiting cold 
    water to quench the cooking. After a minute or so, you can pour the 
    other 1/2 cup of <b>Water</b> into the pan with only moderate 
    sizzling. The Caramel will immediately seize up hard.</li>
  <li>Put the pan back on the slow burner and heat it, but not to a 
    boil. Stir often until the caramel has completely dissolved into 
    the water. Let it cool for a few minutes, then pour it into a small 
    wide mouth jar.</li>
  <li>If you got it right, it should have a very dark color and 
    moderately bittersweet flavor. Cover the jar and store it at 
    room temperature - it will not spoil.</li>
