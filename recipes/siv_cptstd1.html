  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove stems and caps from <b>CHILIS</b>.</li>
  <li>On a Comel or similar flat iron surface, toast the <b>Chilis</b>, 
    turning almost constantly and pressing flat. They <b>must</b> be 
    toasted slowly over moderate heat, so you're going to be stuck at 
    the stove for about 20 minutes. A surface temperature for the 
    pan of 350&deg;F/175&deg;C seems to work well. You should never 
    see smoke, but you should definitely smell them as they start to get 
    hot enough. They should end up brittle, very dark, almost black, but 
    not at all burned or they will be unpleasantly bitter. </li>
  <li>Let <b>Chilis</b> cool thoroughly. Discard any seeds that have 
    escaped into the pan.</li>
  <li> Grind <b>Chilis</b> to a small flake by your preferred means, 
    seeds and all. I use a mini-prep food processor.</li>
  <li>Sealed tightly in a jar and stored away from light and heat, this 
    flake should be usable for a few months, but does slowly decline in 
    quality</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Dry red Thai Phrik Kaeng are 
  used in Thailand but are not yet available in North America. Expert 
  opinion is that Mexican Puya chilis are very close in size, flavor and 
  hotness. These are available in the chili section of some markets that 
  serve a Mexican community. For details see our
