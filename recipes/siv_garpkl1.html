Pickled Garlic is an important ingredient in Thailand. It can be 
purchased in jars from markets serving a Southeast Asian community, 
and is also easily made at home, though a little differently, 
see <a href="siv_garpkl1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <ol>
  <li>Set <b>GARLIC HEADS</b>, on the counter and strike them sharply 
    with the heel of your hand to separate the cloves.</li>
  <li>Peel the <b>Garlic Cloves</b> (see <a href="siv_garpkl1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b>
    </a>).</li>
  <li>In a non-reactive saucepan, mix all <b>Pickle items</b> and bring 
    to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes, or until all solids 
    have dissolved.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic Cloves</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer 
    1 minute, then remove from heat.</li>
  <li>When cool enough, pack <b>Garlic</b> into a sterile jar. Bring the 
    <b>Pickle Liquid</b> back to a boil, pour in over the Garlic and 
    seal tightly. Don't worry that you have a lot of pickle liquid for 
    the amount of garlic, it is used in recipes. Let sit in a cool place 
    for 1 week or a little more before using. Refrigerate after opening.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for White Distilled Vinegar, 
  but some call for Rice Vinegar.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peeling Garlic:</h3> &nbsp; This is done with 
  two spacious stainless steel or sturdy plastic bowls, one inverted 
  over the other with the Garlic Cloves inside. You hold the bowls 
  together by the rims and shake vigorously. Videos on the Internet 
  show the cloves completely peeled in 10 seconds or so - but I have 
  found this quite variable, with some taking several minutes of 
  vigorous shaking. You can stop to rest now and then and remove the 
  cloves that did peel, then shake some more. You'll probably end up 
  with a few recalcitrant cloves that didn't peel, but their skins 
  will be loose and easily peeled by hand.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Garlic heads and cloves are much larger in 
  North America than in Thailand, so we pickle as peeled cloves rather 
  than whole heads. This is a well balanced sweet-sour recipe. Some 
  recipes use a <u>lot</u> more sugar.</li>
