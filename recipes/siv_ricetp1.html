<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweet Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as "glutinous rice" (it contains 
  no gluten) and "sticky rice", this chalky looking rice is available in 
  just about all East and Southeast Asian  markets. It's usually packed 
  in smaller bags because (except in Laos and the Laotian part of 
  northern Thailand) it's used mainly for sweets. There are two 
  varieties, Thai Long Grain, and Short Grain everywhere else. Either 
  can be used.</li>
