Crisply fried Shallots are a very popular garnish in Southeast Asia, 
and a very tasty garnish it is. How much oil you need depends on whether 
you just want fried shallots or if you also want a flavored oil for stir 
frying, salads and the like. 
</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
This recipe makes both fried shallots and oil. You end up with enough 
Fried Shallots to fill an 8 oz jar and a bit less than a cup of Shallot 
Oil. A wok is the best pan for frying them.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min work - 25 min to 6 hours 
    (see <a href="siv_shalfry1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise. Cut off the tip and 
    peel. Slice crosswise very thin and as evenly as possible to assure 
    even browning. Massage to break layers apart. See also 
    <a href="siv_shalfry1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Set out a heatproof bowl with a strainer over it to drain the 
    oil when the Shallots are done.</li>
  <li>Heat the <b>Oil</b> to about 275&deg;F/135&deg;C over low flame. 
    Stir in the <b>Shallots</b>. The temperature will drop to around 
    220&deg;F/104&deg;C. Keep it around there so they are bubbling 
    well. Stir the Shallots very often until they reach a dark golden 
    color. If this doesn't take at least 15 minutes your temperature 
    is too high and you risk bitterness. At this point the bubbling 
    will be less, and the temperature may have risen back to 275&deg;F 
    but shouldn't get significantly higher. See also 
    <a href="siv_shalfry1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Pour the <b>Shallots</b> into the strainer and let the oil drain 
    through thoroughly.  Spread the <b>Shallots</b> out on paper towels 
    to drain further.</li>
  <li>Sealed in a small, airtight container, the <b>Shallots</b> will 
    be good for a few days, but will gradually lose their crispness 
    (though they retain their flavors). In a sealed jar, the oil should 
    last a couple of weeks at room temperature, longer in the fridge.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shallots:</h3> &nbsp; Small spherical Southeast Asian shallots 
  are preferred, as they are less sharp than the large European shallots, 
  but the European ones can be used, and are much less tedious.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; If your objective is to produce 
  Shallot Oil as well as Fried Shallots, use 1 cup or a little more. 
  Use a fairly neutral oil. Since the oil may also be used at high 
  temperatures for stir fry or the like, use a high temperature oil, 
  such as Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), Peanut Oil or Olive Pomace Oil. 
  Avoid polyunsaturated vegetable oils which don't store well and start 
  to go rancid as soon as the temperature gets high.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Prep:</h3> &nbsp; If you have time, you can spread the Shallot 
  slices out and let them get fairly dry, tumbling now and then. This 
  can be up to 6 hours, depending on weather. You will get a more even 
  browning in considerably less time. This is how commercial products 
  are made.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The slower you fry the shallots, the more 
  even they will be and the longer they will stay crisp. I have fried 
  shallots so slowly it took an hour and a half before they browned, 
  and that worked fine. A slow fry takes less attention for most of 
  the time, but browning will happen fairly rapidly when it gets there.
