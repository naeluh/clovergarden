A very important Chili Sambal in Malaysia and Singapore, used in many dishes. 
Color and heat will depend on what chilis you use and how long you fry,

  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/8 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>TAMARIND</b> in warm water for at least 20 minutes. Press 
    through a wire strainer, discarding solids.</li>
  <li>Cut or break <b>DRIED CHILIS</b> into pieces and soak in warm 
    water for about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li>Crush or grate <b>PALM SUGAR</b> as needed.</li>
  <li>Peel of tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard root. 
    Smash bottom 5 inches with your kitchen mallet, then slice that 5 inches 
    very thin.</li>
  <li>Chop fresh <b>RED CHILIS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Dry pan toast <b>BELACHAN</b>, breaking up into fine crumbles until 
    it is very aromatic. This will stink up the kitchen.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender (or 
    in a large stone Mortar). Grinding or pounding, add <b>Rampah items</b> 
    <u>in the order given</u>, not adding the next until well processed. You 
    are done when the Rampah is a smooth paste. If you are using a machine, 
    you may add the minimum amount of <b>Water</b> to get the job done, but 
    if pounding, you will not need Water.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/8 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a wok or saut&eacute; pan (3 qt), heat <b>Oil</b>. Over moderate 
    heat, stir in <b>Rampah mix</b> and fry, stirring often, until it has 
    incorporated all the oil and is quit aromatic, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir the strained <b>Tamarind Paste</b> into the pan and fry over 
    very moderate heat, stirring almost constantly.  Oil may begin to 
    separate at about 30 minutes. Best to use a silicone spatula until 
    stuff starts to stick to the pan, then switch to wood. Keep stirring 
    and scraping the pan. If it seems too dry, add more oil. You'll probably 
    have to add quite a lot of oil, as it should finish fairly oily. Note 
    that experts say the minimum time for frying is 30 minutes, but they 
    recommend continuing for a full hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Palm Sugar</b> until it melts completely and is fully 
    distributed, then set aside to cool.</li>
  <li>Store in an air tight jar with a coating of oil on top. It will keep 
    in the fridge for about 1 month.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe presumes block form, soaked and 
  stained as it gives the best flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Experienced makers of this Sambal consider 
  use of Palm Sugar essential. It is available from markets serving a 
  Southeast Asian community. The form I buy is in convenient 1 Tablespoon 
  cakes, but is quite hard. Since I have the Mixie out for this recipe 
  anyway, I break them up a bit and run them to powder in the Mixie.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Candlenuts:</h3> &nbsp; These are a thickener much used in Southeast 
  Asia. Best to buy them in the vacuum pack as they go rancid quickly. If 
  not available, use raw Macadamias or raw Cashews. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sr_candlez.html"><b>Candlenut</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; No recipe I've seen says what kind or how 
  hot, so it's up to you to choose. Since what they use in Malaysia won't 
  be available anyway, and since all chilis came from the Americas anyway, 
  use what's available here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chilis, Red Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; The only recipe I saw that named these 
  called for medium hot "Dutch Chilis" ("Holland Red" in North America) which 
  are an Indonesian variety. Here Red Fresnos are much easier to find, and  
  they make an excellent substitute, for flavor and hotness. For details of 
  both see our <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Belachan:</h3> &nbsp; A powerful fermented shrimp paste, an essential 
  ingredient for Malaysian and Singapore cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html#bela"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; You want a durable frying oil. Some recipes call for 
  Peanut (Groundnut) oil, which is good, and Rice Bran Oil is acceptable. 
  I used Olive Pomace, but Pure Olive would work (not Virgin). Some recipes 
  allow Coconut Oil, which is fine, but hardens when refrigerated. Vegetable 
  Oils would probably be significantly rancid after an hour of frying. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking Oils</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example is very dark, as it was made 
  with Guajillo Chilis, a rather dark chili, and was fried a full hour. I 
  chose Guajillos because I wanted a moderately hot batch, and I had a lot 
  of them.</li>
