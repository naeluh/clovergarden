Prahok and Tuk Prahok are the Fish Sauces of Cambodia. They are quite 
pungent, but, like other fish sauces, they blend well into recipes, 
enhancing the overall flavors.

<h3>Prahok:</h3> &nbsp; This is your raw material, Prahok, fish 
or fish chunks fermented for a few months to 3 years. Asian markets 
serving a Southeast Asian Community will have a selection of such jars 
made with various fish. They will almost always be from Vietnam and 
labeled "Mam C&aacute; (name of fish)". The main ingredients should be 
Fish, Salt, Sugar, Powdered Grilled Rice, and a preservative.  For some 
applications this preserved fish can simply be ground up as plain 
<i>Prahok</i>.<p></p>

<h3>Pa Daek / Nam Pla Raa:</h3> &nbsp; These are the names 
used in Laos and Issan (northeastern Thailand) where much of the 
population is Lao. For these cuisines always select versions made from 
fresh water fish like Gourami or Mudfish (Snakehead). It is usually 
just ground up for use in that region.

Typically, what's in the jar will look something like this. You want to 
spoon out about 2 Tablespoons per cup of water you will be using, maybe 
3 Tablespoons if you want it a bit stronger.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> &nbsp; In a saucepan place a cup of <b>Water</b> 
for every 2 to 3 Tablespoons of fish you will be using. Bring it to a 
boil.
<br><b>2.</b> &nbsp; Stir in the <b>Fish</b> and bring back to a simmer. 
Simmer for about 15 minutes, squishing the fish now and then. Some types 
will break up, others will remain firm.
<br><b>3.</b> &nbsp; Pour through a strainer, pressing down on the 
fish. Discard the solids and keep the liquid.
<br><b>4.</b> &nbsp; Strain the liquid through a piece of muslin to 
remove small particles. If the muslin has too high a thread count (from 
expensive bed sheets) it will filter very slowly. Actually, I use an 
extremely fine Asian wire strainer with a mesh not much larger than 
muslin.
<br><b>5.</b> &nbsp; Store in a cool place in a sealed container.
