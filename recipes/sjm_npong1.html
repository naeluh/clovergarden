  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Paste</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, cut off hard root 
    end and pound thoroughly with the smooth side of your kitchen mallet - 
    then slice crosswise as thin as you can for about 4 to 5 inches from 
    the root end. Pound in a mortar with <b>Salt</b> until reduced to 
    thin flakes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO STEMS</b> and <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine.  Add to the 
    mortar and pound to paste.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> in a Garlic Press. Chop fine to break up 
    fibers. Add to the mortar along with <b>Palm Sugar</b> and pound 
    some more.</li>
  <li>Break <b>PUYA CHILIS</b> and dump out seeds. Grind together with 
    <b>THAI CHILIS</b> in your spice grinder. Add to the mortar along 
    with <b>Shrimp Paste</b>. Pound until all is well blended.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    the <b>Paste</b> until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until it has completely lost 
    its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Bring to a simmer, 
    cover and simmer, stirring now and then, until the tomatoes are 
    quite soft, about 7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Adjust consistency as needed. It should have a sauce consistency 
    but not at all watery.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, chop <b>Cilantro</b> and stir in. This 
    dip can be served warm or cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Ripe and Sweet is important here. In Laos, 
  Cherry Tomatoes would be used</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refines sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cilantro Stems:</h3> &nbsp; Include no leaves. This should actually 
  be Cilantro Roots, but those are difficult to get even in Southern 
  California. If you can get roots, use a little less if given by volume 
  as they are not hollow like stems.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chilis, Puya:</h3> &nbsp; In Thailand Prik Kaeng dried chilis would 
  be used, but Mexican Puyas are an accurate substitute. Three of the 
  more common Gujillo will also work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Thai Chilis, dry</h3> &nbsp;  Fresh or dry, these are very hot, so 
  vary quantity according to your own best judgement. Five makes this 
  sauce "satisfyingly hot" by Southern California standards. Fresh or dry, 
  de Arbol Chilis are a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably Thai shrimp paste, which 
  is a bit more refined than most. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
