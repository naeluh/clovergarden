This all purpose Burmese table condiment will likely ruin you for bottled 
sauces - and it's so easy to make. It's fine too for Thai and Lao - the 
three share borders and elements of each other's cuisines. I love 
this stuff as a dip for raw vegies, shrimp, smelts, meats, etc.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Remove caps from <b>Chilis</b>, break in half and dump out seeds 
    that fall freely - don't over-do it. I have had dried chilis so 
    fresh I had to cut them lengthwise to get any seeds out.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse. Measure is after chopping.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Chilis</b> in a small pan with the 3/4 cup of water. Bring 
    up to a simmer and simmer about 5 minutes. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic</b> for the last minute or so of simmering- but 
    see <a href="sjv_chilgar1.html#02">Note-2</a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sugar</b> and pour it all into the bowl of your blender. 
    A food processor will work too, unless the dried chilis are very 
    fresh and leathery.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Blend at highest speed or process as 
    fine as your device will get it, scraping down the sides as needed.
    </li>
  <li>Pour in <b>Rice Vinegar</b> and blend a little more.</li>
  <li>Pour into a jar. It will keep several weeks in a sealed jar in 
    the fridge. See also <a href="sjv_chilgar1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Dried Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Select bright red 
  dried chilis fresh enough to still have some flexibility. Most people 
  will be satisfied with the common Japones, and that's what I use when 
  setting it out for a general dip. If you want a bit hotter, de Arbols 
  or Thai Chilis. Color will depend on how fresh and red the dried chilis 
  are. The photo example was made with chilis so fresh they were still 
  leathery. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Garlic:</h3> &nbsp; I use American garlic whenever 
  possible. Chinese garlic tends to be old and dry by time it gets here. 
  If that's what you have, add it to the chilis at start so it gets 
  more cooking time.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer palm sugar, or a 
  partially refined cane sugar like turbinado or Zulka Morena for better 
  flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as 
  essential to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Use an unseasoned rice 
  vinegar. My favorite by far is Kong Yen Foods "Aged gourmet rice 
  vinegar" from Taiwan.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce is usable when 
  first made, but it starts out a bit watery. The tiny particles of 
  chili flesh continue to absorb liquid, so it will be thicker after 
  some hours of rest. This sauce is excellent on the table for chili 
  buffs, especially when you need to back off on recipe heat due to 
  serving a group with mixed chili preferences.</li>
