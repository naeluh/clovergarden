An essential Thai table condiment - especially useful when you have to 
make the food less hot for guests. You spoon both the liquid and chili 
slices onto your food - which adds hotness and sourness without conflict 
with the true flavors of the food it is used with.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
If you must have a 
pure vegetarian version, use 1 t salt instead of the fish sauce and add 
a little palm sugar. This sauce is also made with lime juice (see 
<a href="sjv_chililime1.html"><b>Chili Lime Sauce</b></a>) but I prefer 
this one because so many Thai dishes already have plenty of lime juice 
in them. This one is also less perishable.

  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very thin, discarding any that have turned dark 
    inside. Mix with <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Store in a tightly sealed jar. If possible age it a few days before 
    using to allow heat and flavor to blend and mellow. The bright 
    green color soon fades to olive green, but the flavor is good. This 
    condiment keeps weeks at room temperature, many months refrigerated.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Thai Chilis</h3> &nbsp; These are generally used green, though 
  I sometimes include a few red ones. Before fresh Thai chilis were 
  available in California, Thai restaurants used Serranos. People became 
  so accustomed to the more flavorful Serrano, better restaurants now 
  provide both (authenticity and flavor). To satisfy the demands of those 
  who've been to California, Serrano chilis are now being grown in 
  Thailand. If using Serranos, use half as many - they are not as hot, 
  but much larger. Less hot chilis are far less satisfying in this sauce.
