<h1>Vegetarian Fish Sauce</h1>

<p>Fish sauce is absolutely essential for Southeast Asia cuisines, 
including Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Indonesian, and Philippine. 
This has been a serious problem for vegetarians. The usual advice, 
"Use light soy sauce" or "Use plain salt", is not at all satisfactory. 
Commercial vegetarian fish sauces are difficult to find, and I can 
report first hand they are as vile and disgusting as others have 
claimed. They are from Vietnam, which has a strict Chinese style 
Buddhism, while Thai Buddhism is happy with "don't ask, don't tell". This 
is the policy I recommend, but it will not be acceptable to some strict 
vegetarians. Do-it-yourself formulas I've read seem over complicated and 
I'm not confident of the results, so here I present the very simple and 
effective recipes I've composed.  Both clear and murky fish sauces are 
used in Southeast Asia, and I present a recipe for each.</p>

While many recipes require a clear fish sauce, I have found very little 
on vegetarian versions. This one fills the bill pretty well. Of course, 
it can't taste "just like real fish sauce" without fish, but you knew 
there would be sacrifices before you chose vegetarianism.

This is the "fish sauce" to use if you don't actually need a clear sauce. 
While little known in North America, the murky fish sauces are much used 
in Southeast Asia, especially in Issan (northeast Thailand), Laos, and 
the Philippines. In these regions it is used more than the clear.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Seaweed:</b> &nbsp; I use dried Wakame, easily available in 
  East and Southeast Asian markets, but feel free to experiment with 
  other seaweeds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/algae.html"><b>Algae Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Shiitakes, Dried:</b> &nbsp; Also called Chinese Black 
  Mushrooms, these are available in any Asian market and in the Asian 
  section of most supermarkets.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Yellow Bean Sauce:</b> &nbsp; Alas, the "Dragonfly" brand 
  (Kwong Hung Seng) we all loved is now "stop at the border" due to 
  persistent contamination. I prefer AC brand, but Healthy Boy is 
  much more available. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> page.
