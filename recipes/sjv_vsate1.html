A very flavorful Chili Garlic Sauce recipe with Lemon Grass, 
often used over noodle dishes. This is a fairly simple and fairly mild 
version - I can almost eat it with a spoon.  See <a href="sjv_vsate1.html#07">

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - plus cooling)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel off tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off 
    the hard root end. Smash the bottom 5 inches well with your 
    kitchen mallet, then slice crosswise as thin as you can. Pound in 
    big stone mortar to soften (see <a href="sjv_vsate1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> through a Garlic Press and chop fine. Chop 
    <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine. Pound them together with the Lemon Grass in the 
    mortar.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan, heat <b>Oil</b> over medium high flame. Stir in 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b>, <b>Sugar</b> and <b>Salt</b> and fry with 
    light stirring for about 3 minutes - you want the raw smell gone, 
    but there should be no browning. Take off the heat and allow to cool 
    for about 4 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili Flake</b> (2 oz is about 1/2 cup) and 
    <b>Paprika</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Place back over Low Heat for about 2 minutes to blend flavors.</li>
  <li>When you see some bubbling, stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Taste and 
    stir in <b>Sriracha</b> to your preference. Bring just to a simmer, 
    then take off the heat and let cool before serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a fairly neutral oil. Olive Pomace or Pure 
  Olive Oil are good, but not Virgin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Thai chili flake is usually made from 
  long moderately hot chilis. I use Korean flake which is similarly mild, 
  and much easier to find around here. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; This is for color and consistency. A real 
  Hungarian Paprika will have better color and flavor than supermarket 
  Paprika.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sriracha Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is your final heat adjustment. 
  Use none or a lot depending on your preference, but this is a sauce so 
  it should be a bit hotter than something you would want to eat alone.
  The ubiquitous Huy Fong Foods (Rooster Brand) Sriracha Sauce will work 
  fine.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Pulverizing:</h3> &nbsp; This is best done in a big stone mortar, 
  but you can use a mini-prep processor. The result will be a bit 
  different, and garlic and shallots aren't well behaved in a processor, 
  but it will work if you scrape down the sides a few times.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Say "Sa TEAR". This sauce, originated from 
  the TeoChew people in eastern Guangdong Province on the south coast of 
  China. It is totally different from Thai Sate Sauce, which is made from 
  peanuts. It is made in many levels of complexity and hotness. The oil 
  that comes to the top is often drizzled on dishes as a garnish - it is 
  brilliant red, even though it doesn't look that way in the photo.</li>
