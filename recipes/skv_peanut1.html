Roasted peanuts, whole or crushed, are a much used garnish throughout 
Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Pan roasting your own raw peanuts 
provides a better flavor and softer texture than commercially roasted 
peanuts.

I dislike overly crunchy commercial peanuts as a garnish, 
but made this way I like them. See <a href="skv_peanut2.html">
<b>Whole Peanut Garnish</b></a> for an example.  Of course you can roast 
peanuts this way just to eat them - and they're still a lot better than 
commercial. Unroasted raw peanuts are a little bitter and probably very 
slightly toxic (as most uncooked beans are). If you want them salted you 
can grind salt to a powder in your spice grinder and tumble the roasted 
peanuts with it, but I have found these freshly roasted peanuts are so 
good they don't need salt at all.

  <li>Check your <b>PEANUTS</b> by smell and taste to make sure they have 
    no trace of rancidity, They should have a slight raw bean bitterness 
    but no rancidity.</li>
  <li>On a dry griddle or iron skillet roast the <b>Peanuts</b>, turning 
    and stirring very often until lightly browned (they will be spotty). 
    Do not over-brown - the photo shows them as dark as they should ever 
    get. If you have an infrared surface thermometer, keep the surface 
    of the iron at between 420&deg;F/215&deg;C and 440&deg;F/225&deg;C 
    to get the job done as quickly as possible (about 10 minutes). In 
    any case, if you see a wisp of smoke, turn it down. A thin turner, 
    as shown in the photo, is best because it can get under the peanuts 
    and turn them over for the most even roasting.</li>
  <li>Pour the <b>Peanuts</b> out on a plate and cool completely before 
    crushing, chopping or storing. Package in an airtight bag or jar and 
    store at a cool temperature. Use within a few days for best results.

<b>NOTES:</b>

<li id="01">
  <b>Peanuts:</b> &nbsp; For garnishes you'll want raw 
  blanched (skin-off) peanuts. For general eating I've used unblanched 
  (skin on) Spanish peanuts and they were fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_peanutz.html">Peanuts</a> page.</li>
