  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b>, and  slice lengthwise 1/4 inch wide. Cut 
    <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths and split bulb ends. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Grind <b>Dried Shrimp</b> in your spice grinder. Prepare 
  <b>Tamarind Paste</b> if using block form. Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3>  &nbsp; These should be the common 
  dried Japones, which are not excessively hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp, Dried:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found 
  in markets serving Southeast Asia, South American, Mexican and 
  African communities. Measure should be whole for very small ones 
  and lightly broken up for large ones.  For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind 
  is concentrate in a jar, use 1 T, or if it's block use about 1 T, soak 
  and strain. If you don't have tamarind use 2 t lemon juice - not the 
  same, but it's something. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1 T 
  <a href="six_chilitam1.html"><b>Chili Tamarind Paste</b></a>. My 
  version here presumes you don't have that on hand and fakes it up with 
  2 chilis, tamarind paste and dried shrimp. If you have it, you can 
  substitute it for those items in the sauce.</li>
