A delicious stew of Chicken, Tomatoes and Potatoes. It can be made with 
joints, or with skinless, boneless chicken meat (best for buffet 
service). This recipe can be made ahead and reheats well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 1-1/2 inch chunks (or see 
    <a href="smc_chkafri1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). </li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise about 3/8 
    inch wide. Chop <b>GARLIC</b> coarse. Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILI</b> diagonally into thin slices.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>Bell Pepper</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane Torch</b></a> and brush 
    the skin off under running water. Slice into narrow strips about 
    1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Peel Potatoes and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan (or see 
    <a href="smc_chkafri1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Fry half the <b>Chicken</b>, 
    tumbling often until lightly browned on all sides. Remove and set 
    aside. Repeat with the other half of the <b>Chicken</b>, adding 
    more <b>Oil</b> if needed. If the fond starts to gets too dark, 
    go to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Pour off oil so there is no more than 1 T left. Over moderately 
    high heat, stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until Onion is 
    translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring now and then until 
    softened.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Chicken</b> to the pan and add <b>Stock</b>, 
    <b>Bay Leaf</b>, <b>Chili</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Bring to a 
    boil, then simmer covered for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in with <b>Bell Pepper</b>. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer covered another 20 minutes or until chicken 
    is tender.</li>
  <li>Uncover and check liquid - there should be a fair amount. Adjust 
    as needed. Stir in <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless thigh meat 
  (best for buffet service). I use the bones and skins to make the 
  stock, so no flavor is lost. Up the weight to 1-1/2 pounds for joints 
  with bones. The pattern recipe asked for 1-1/2 pounds Thighs cut in 
  half. For the photo example, I had a bunch of Chicken Wing Joints in  
  my freezer compartment, so I used 1-1/2 pounds of those. If you do use 
  whole thighs, a razor sharp <a href="../ke/kn_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese 
  Cleaver Knife</b></a> driven by a Soft Faced Mallet is perfect for 
  cutting them in half.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes of 
  this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential 
  to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; I absolutely <u>HATE</u> pan frying Chicken, 
  and so many recipes call for it. It splatters oil all over the place, 
  and it's hard to get any browning on the chicken itself without burning 
  the fond that sticks to the pan. This recipe can be done pan frying, 
  but if making more than a single recipe (like for a party), I would 
  <u>definitely</u> bring down my Indian 
  <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a> and deep fry the chicken. 
  It takes a lot less time, makes much less mess, and the Chicken can 
  actually be browned.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe didn't mention torching the 
  Bell Pepper, but, with the proper torch, it takes only a couple minutes 
  and is well worth the effort, especially if the recipe is to be 
  reheated. You don't want tough pepper skins floating in your stew like 
  strips of plastic.</li>
