An excellent and very popular curry. California restaurants 
cut the bamboo in very narrow strips, but in Thailand they cut wider. 
This recipe is moderately spicy, but exact hotness depends on the curry 
paste.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> about 3/8 inch thick and cut slices into 
    bite size strips or chunks.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut to a 
    size similar to the Chicken.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, and start them soaking in 
    cold water. This will help keep them green when added to the curry.
    </li>
  <li>Blast the <b>CHILIS</b> black with your propane torch and brush 
    off the skins under running water (see <a href="smc_chkbamb1.html#09">Note-9</a>). 
    Seed them and cut into strips about 1/4 inch wide and 1 to 1-1/2 
    inches long.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>LIME LEAVES</b> up (end to end) as tight as you can. Slice 
    these rolls into threads as fine as you can cut them. Discard the 
    central stem and make a few cuts through the threads to shorten 
    them. Mix with <b>Chilis</b>.</li>
  <li>Open <b>COCONUT MILK</b> <u>without shaking</u>. Scoop about 6 
    ounces off the top, including all the cream. Hold separate from 
    the rest of the Coconut Milk.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok, place the <b>Coconut Cream</b> part 
    of the Coconut milk. Bring to a boil (carefully), then stir in 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until evenly distributed. Keep at a strong simmer  
    over moderate heat, stirring until red oil starts to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>. Cook over moderate heat, stirring often 
    for about 5 minutes until you again see red oil starting to separate.
    </li>
  <li>Slowly stir in remaining <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then stir in <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Bring back to 
    a simmer and stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Cover 
    and simmer for another 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> and simmer another 5 minutes. You can 
    hold it hot for awhile at this point.</li> 
  <li>When ready to serve - take off heat. Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b> 
    and stir in well. Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine 
    rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. I always 
  use thigh/leg meat for better flavor and texture than the cardboard 
  breasts we get around here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but a hassle and not 
  always available. Best to buy in vacuum pack bags (unless your market 
  has them in a bulk tub). Canned is available everywhere, but needs to 
  be par boiled for 5 minutes or more to remove the metallic taste.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Ripe 
  Fresnos, but other medium hot red chilis, such as Holland Red will 
  work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 3 stems (more if one of the leaves is very small). 
  For details See our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir 
  Lime</b></a> page. If you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes 
  before you squeeze them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Unsweetened</u>. Coconut milk from 
  Thailand is excellent. I use Aroy-D, but there are other fine brands. 
  A good quality Coconut Milk will have lots of heavy cream at the top. 
  Check the recipe - you may need to avoid shaking the can before 
  opening.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Paste, Red:</h3> &nbsp; You can buy commercially made Thai 
  Red Curry Paste, but it is better made at home - see our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">Red Curry Paste</a>. Our recipe is 
  probably a little hotter than most commercial versions, but some of 
  those are so salty you may have to cut back on the Fish Sauce. 
  "Thai Red Curry Sauce" sold by yuppie outlets is <u>not</u> suitable 
  for Thai (or Clovegarden) recipes.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refined sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Skinning the chilis is optional, but I always 
  do it as it improves the texture, and it's particularly important if 
  any of this curry will be reheated. Some recipes add a vegetable. If 
  I did, Long Beans would be my choice, about 6 ounces, cut 1-1/4 inches 
  long and stirred in with the Chilis.</li>
