This excellent curry shows a strong Indian influence, but with a Burmese 
finish. It is moderately hot by Burmese and Southern California standards 
- adjust as needed.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite size pieces about 1-1/2 inch to a 
    side. If using whole chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings) cut each 
    part in half crosswise. A razor sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven 
    by a soft faced mallet is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>DRY CHILIS</b> until they begin to darken, then grind 
    together all <b>Marinade items</b>. Massage into <b>Chicken</b> and 
    set aside for about 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> small, Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Slice <b>GINGER ROOT</b> very thin, cut slices into threads and chop 
    fine. Chop <b>RED CHILI</b> small. Mix all and grind to a paste in a 
    large stone mortar or in a mini-prep food processor.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry
    <b>Chicken</b> until just starting to brown. Scoop out with a slotted 
    spoon, drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Shallot Mix</b> and fry for about 3 minutes until 
    aromatic and raw flavor is gone, then stir in <b>Curry Leaves</b> and 
    <b>Garam Masala</b> until aromatic (1 minute).</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Chicken</b> back in until well coated, then stir in 
    <b>Stock</b>. Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes until chicken is 
    cooked tender and sauce is reduced to the desired degree.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and simmer 1 minute, then stir in 
    <b>Lime Juice</b>  and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless pieces - preferably 
  thigh / leg meat for best flavor and texture. Bone in pieces can also 
  be used but increase the weight to 1-1/2 pounds.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, dry:</h3> &nbsp; Arbols will work if you don't have 
  Thai, or the common Japones for less heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but 
  other medium hot red chilis will work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you use, 
  because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garam Masala:</h3> &nbsp; This is a "standard" spice mix, but 
  varies a lot from region to region, and some from one household 
  to another within the regions. Our <a href="iys_gmbong1.html">
  <b>Garam Masala - Bengal</b></a> would be good, as Bengal is not 
  far from Burma.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> Both Burma and Myanmar are correct and allowed. Both 
  refer to the dominant Bamar tribe. Aung San Suu Kyi uses Burma.</li>
