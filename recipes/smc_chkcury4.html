This outstandingly delicious curry is simple and easy to make. It 
reheats well so can be made ahead. This recipe could be extended by 
adding some pre-cooked potatoes.

<p>Preparing to serve dinner to a mixed couple (carni &amp; veg), I 
created also a vegetarian version, <a href="smv_potcury1.html">
<b>Potato Curry, Sumatra</b></a> which also turned out very well.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b>.into moderate size chunks (see 
    <a href="smc_chkcury4.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Without shaking up the can, open a 14 ounce can of <b>Coconut 
    Milk</b>. Skim 4 ounces of the thick cream off the top for the paste. 
    Reserve the rest for the curry.</li> 
  <li>Grind the <b>CHILIS</b> to powder in your spice grinder. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>ONION</b> thin and chop fine. 
    Crush <b>Candlenuts</b>. Mix all together in a large mortar and pound 
    to paste,</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Coconut Cream</b> into the paste until it is all even.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Galangal</b> thin and mix all <b>Finish items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> moderately 
    hot. Stir in <b>Paste</b> and fry stirring until aromatic, about 1 
    minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> until well coated with paste and their 
    raw color is almost gone. This is a sort of hot marinade.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Finish mix</b>. Simmer over moderate flame, uncovered, 
    stirring often, until sauce is reduced by about 1/3. Caution: the 
    sauce will look a lot more liquid when simmering than it actually 
    is, so don't over-do it. Cover and simmer slowly until chicken is 
    tender, about 1/2 hour total.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless / boneless. 
  Thighs and leg meat should be used rather than breast for much better 
  flavor and texture. The pattern recipe calls for a 3-1/2 pound chicken 
  cut into serving pieces, but that's more of a serving problem.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Coconut Cream:</h3> &nbsp; No, you don't have to open a whole can 
  - see instruction step 2. A good quality Thai coconut milk like Aroy-D 
  will have enough cream.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Thai or de Arbols are good. Four makes a 
  satisfyingly hot curry by Southern California standards, or use 
  Japones for less heat - use you own best judgement. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Candlenuts:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have these, substitute 4 raw 
  Macadamia Nuts or 5 raw Cashews or 9 raw almonds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_candlez.html"><b>Candlenut</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05"><h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this, 
  substitute a lightly refined sugar like Turbinado - a little less tasty 
  but tolerable.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Salam Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in the "Indonesian 
  specialties" section of some large Asian markets. A package will have 
  many sizes, but figure an average Salam Leaf is about the size of a l
  arge Bay Leaf, and compensate as needed. If you don't have these, you 
  may have a problem. Curry leaves are the best substitute, but bay 
  leaves, often suggested, are not so suitable. If that's all you have, 
  use just one, and a half teaspoon of lime juice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/my_dsalamz.html"><b>Daun Salam</b></a> page.</li>
