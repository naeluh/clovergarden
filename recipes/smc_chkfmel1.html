A very flavorful curry with good Chicken / Vegetable balance - moderately 
spicy, but exact hotness depends on the curry paste and how much you use.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> about 3/8 inch thick and cut slices into 
    bite size strips or chunks.</li>
  <li>Scrape <b>FUZZY MELON</b> (no need to peel, just take off the thin 
    dark green skin). Split lengthwise into quarters (or sixths if large) 
    and cut into slices 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, and start them soaking in 
    cold water. This will help keep them green when added to the curry, 
    but not for long.</li>
  <li>Blast the <b>CHILIS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off the skins under running water 
    (see <a href="smc_chkfmel1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>). Seed them and cut into strips 
    about 1/4 inch wide and 1 to 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>LIME LEAVES</b> up (end to end) as tight as you can. Slice 
    these rolls into threads as fine as you can cut them. Discard the 
    central stem and make a few cuts through the threads to shorten 
    them. Mix with <b>Chilis</b>.</li>
  <li>Open <b>COCONUT MILK</b> <u>without shaking</u>. Scoop about 6 
    ounces off the top, including all the cream. Hold separate from 
    the rest of the Coconut Milk.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok, place the <b>Coconut Cream</b> part 
    of the Coconut milk. Bring to a boil (carefully), then stir in 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until evenly distributed. Keep at a strong simmer  
    over moderate heat, stirring until red oil starts to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>. Cook over moderate heat, stirring often, 
    until you again see red oil starting to separate.</li>
  <li>Slowly stir in remaining <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then stir in <b>Fuzzy Melon</b>. Bring back to 
    a simmer and stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Palm Sugar</b> (if using). 
    Cover and simmer for about 12 minutes until the Fuzzy Melon is nearly 
    done. It is done when it's translucent, but the seed mass has not 
    started to fall out.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> and simmer another 5 minutes. You can 
    hold it hot for awhile at this point.</li> 
  <li>When ready to serve - take off heat. Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b> 
    and stir in well. Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine 
    rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless and boneless. I always 
  use thigh/leg meat for better flavor and texture than the cardboard 
  breasts we get around here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fuzzy Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Mo Gwa, Mo Qua, Moa Gua] &nbsp; Select a 
  fresh looking one that's about 1 pound, or two smaller ones. Note that Thai 
  recipes in English usually call Fuzzy Melon "Winter Melon" (it is an 
  immature Winter Melon). Suitable 
  substitutes are   Opo Squash (Bottle Gourd) or Luffa Squash (a Gourd), ribbed (Chinese Okra) or 
  smooth (Sponge Luffa). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_fuzzyz.html"><b>Fuzzy Melon</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/gourds.html"><b>Gourds</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Ripe 
  Fresnos, but other medium hot red chilis, such as Red Anaheim or Holland 
  Red will work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 3 stems (more if one of the leaves is very small). 
  For details See our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir 
  Lime</b></a> page. If you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes 
  before you squeeze them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Unsweetened</u>. Coconut milk from 
  Thailand is excellent. I use Aroy-D, but there are other fine brands. 
  A good quality Coconut Milk will have lots of heavy cream at the top. 
  Check the recipe - you need to avoid shaking the can before 
  opening.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Paste, Red:</h3> &nbsp; You can buy commercially made Thai 
  Red Curry Paste, but it is better made at home - see our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. Our recipe is 
  probably a little hotter than most commercial versions, but some of 
  those are so salty you may have to cut back on the Fish Sauce. 
  "Thai Red Curry Sauce" sold by yuppie outlets is <u>not</u> suitable 
  for Thai (or Clovegarden) recipes.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; (optional) &nbsp; This is available in pretty 
  much all Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refined sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Skinning the chilis is optional, but I always 
  do it as it improves the texture, and it's particularly important if 
  any of this curry will be reheated, because skins often come loose with 
  reheating. </li>
