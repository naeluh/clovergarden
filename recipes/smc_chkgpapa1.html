A very popular dish in the Philippines, sometimes made with chayote 
instead of green papaya. Leaves are essential, but if you don't have 
chili leaves, there are alternatives.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is for boneless skinless 
  pieces (preferably thigh). In the Philippines a whole 3 pound chicken 
  might be used, or halved or whole bone-in skin-on thigh, leg and wing 
  joints (about 2-1/4 pounds). For buffet service, I favor just meat 
  with stock for more flavor (see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/04">Note-4</a>).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Papaya:</h3> &nbsp; This must be bought specifically as 
  "green papaya" from an Asian market, not just a greenish regular one. 
  The seeds inside should be pure white and the flesh a very pale green, 
  almost white. If you can't get one use chayote squash but give it a bit 
  more cooking time to get tender. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/br_papaz.html"><b>Papayas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; 8 ounces would be for whole stems, and 
  would yield about 4 or 5 ounces of leaves and tender tips. Fresh 
  chili leaves are available only erratically even in the Philippine 
  markets of Los Angeles. Fortunately there are alternatives.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Frozen Chili Leaves:</b> &nbsp; These are usually available 
      in Philippine markets. A half pound frozen package is mostly ice 
      and yields only about 2-1/2 ounces drained leaves, but that's 
      enough. By time you strip fresh ones from the stems and simmer 
      them you're probably near that.</li>
    <li><a href="../ingred/br_moringz.html"><b>Malunggay Leaves:</b></a> 
      &nbsp; This is the most popular alternative in the Philippines. 
      Fresh, they are very available there, but less available than chili 
      leaves around here. Frozen, they are quite available in Philippine 
      markets, misleadingly labeled "Horseradish Leaves". One 8 ounce  
      package yields about 2-1/4 ounces which is enough. Simmer for 
      about 1 minute after adding frozen leaves, 3 minutes for fresh.</li>
    <li><a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach:</b></a> 
      &nbsp; This is my favorite alternative green for this recipe, 
      but, though legal here in California, and available in most Asian 
      markets, it's a controlled substance in some states. Use about 
      5 ounces including smaller stems.</li>
    <li><b>Spinach:</b> &nbsp; This is suggested by Philippine cookbooks, 
      but I consider it the least desirable alternative, as spinach has 
      a lot more oxalate than the others, but it is very available. About 
      4 ounces of leaf should do.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This can be a quite light stock or broth. 
  Since I usually make mine pretty strong, I dilute it to about half 
  with water. Filipinos don't make soup stock in advance (lack of 
  refrigerator space) so they use just water and compensate with bone-in 
  skin-on chicken for flavor. I find that less convenient, particularly 
  for buffet service. For how to have soup stock conveniently 
  on hand, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
