This Burmese country curry is truly wonderful. Burmese curries are quite 
different from both Indian and Thai curries. This one produces a fair 
amount of liquid to wet steamed rice.

In Burma this recipe is also made with more liquid and served as a soup.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Opo Gourd:</h3> &nbsp; [Bottle Gourd] &nbsp; This gourd is now a 
  popular vegetable in North America and easy to find, even in many 
  supermarkets. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_opoz.html">
  <b>Bottle Gourd - Opo / Upo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken Meat</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless. I 
  recommend thigh and/or leg meat, which have much better texture and 
  flavor than the cardboard breasts we get in North America. The pattern 
  recipe called for a whole 2 pound chicken cut into small 
  pieces, so you could do that too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "5 to 8 fresh 
  long chilis", but her book doesn't define what a "long chili" is or 
  even what color or hotness. I use 5 red Fresnos, seeded. Serranos 
  would also be good, seeded or not and in whatever number you wish. 
  This dish is supposed to be fairly hot. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Chilis - Thailand &amp;Southeast 
  Asia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; 5 Fresnos made this curry absolutely perfect 
  for my Southern California taste, but folks from the Frozen North might 
  be distressed. If serving a mixed group (mixed chili preferences, that 
  is, not sexual preferences, though it could be both) you can cut the 
  chilis in half and present Hot Sauce at the table, as is sometimes done 
  in Burma. A home made Burmese <a href="sjv_chilgar1.html">
  <b>Chili Garlic Sauce</b></a> would be elegant, but Huy Fong ("Rooster 
  brand") Chili Garlic or Sambal Oelec sauces will work.  If serving as 
  a soup, cut the Chicken 
  a bit smaller and cut the Opo into about 3/4 inch cubes. Add 
  sufficient water to get the soupiness you desire.</li>
