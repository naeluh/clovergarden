This tasty dish is very popular in Vietnam. It needs to be fairly hot 
from chilis, not quite Thai hot, but close. You can also make this recipe 
with pork or even extra firm tofu.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick slices about 1-1/2 to 
    2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide (or whatever you can do with the 
    chicken you have).</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Coating items</b> and massage into <b>Chicken</b>. Set 
    aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Remove stems and caps from <b>DRIED CHILIS</b> and shake out as many 
    seeds as will shake out.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CARROT</b> into juliennes about 1-1/2 inches long 
    (<a href="smc_chklgrass1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>). Blanch in boiling water for 
    about 1 minute and refresh in cold running water.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> lengthwise into rather narrow wedges. Slice 
    <b>SHALLOT</b> thin. Mix.</li>
  <li>Strip tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b>. Cut off hard root 
    end, then smash the bottom 6 inches well with your kitchen mallet. 
    Slice crosswise as thin as you can, using the bottom 4 inches. Chop 
    as fine as you can get it, then, if possible, pound to a paste in a 
    big granite mortar.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> small. Mix 
    and chop together until exceedingly fine. Add to the 
    <b>Lemon Grass</b> and  pound to a paste. Mix in <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Stock</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Strip <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves from stems for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Drain any free liquid from <b>Chicken</b>.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat. Stir in <b>Dried Chilis</b> and fry stirring for a few seconds 
    until they start to darken. Immediately remove them with a slotted spoon 
    (they must not blacken or they will be bitter) and drain on paper towels.
    The recipe shows them whole, but they could also be chopped coarse 
    (after frying) for better distribution.</li>
  <li>Turn the flame a bit higher and stir in <b>Lemon Grass mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring until fragrant and just starting to darken,</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring for a minute or so, then 
     stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until it has lost its raw 
     color. Use high heat but be careful the fond stuck to the pan doesn't 
     burn at all.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Fish Sauce mix</b> and Simmer covered for 3 to 4 
     minutes, Stir in <b>Carrots</b> for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Dried Chilis</b> and serve garnished with <b>Cilantro 
    Leaves</b>, along with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless and boneless. I favor 
  thigh/leg meat for flavor but breast can be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; I suggest using Japones, which are not 
  nearly as hot as Thai, but the more adventurous can use de Arbols or 
  dried Thai Chilis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This dish should be fairly sharp - but the 
  amount of chili given here is a bit on the moderate side. If you don't 
  have Thai Chilis, use a medium size Serrano, leaving the seeds and 
  membranes in. Feel free to up the amount if you are a chili enthusiast. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; My version uses half the sugar the pattern  
  recipe calls for.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Carrot:</h3> &nbsp; Juliennes made with julienning vegetable 
  peelers or similar devices are too small - cut with a knife.</li>
