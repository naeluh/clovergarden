Chicken and noodles in a rich but mild curry sauce. You may need to 
adjust liquid, depending on your noodles, see <a href="smc_chknood1.html#06">
<b>Consistency</b></a> - it can range from too dry to a "chopsticks 
and spoon" stew.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min including paste)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the curry paste by grinding all the ingredients into a paste. 
    I grind the Coriander and Chili in a spice grinder and pound finely 
    chopped ginger and shallots in a mortar, then work all the ingredients 
    together in the mortar. This makes enough for two recipes - use 2 T for 
    this recipe and freeze the rest for another time.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> dried, soak <b>EGG NOODLES</b> in warm water for about 20 
    minutes, then drain - 4 oz dry makes about 8 oz soaked.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into bite size pieces about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Bring some water to a boil in your tea kettle for adjusting 
    consistency (see <a href="smc_chknood1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry 2 T 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until well blended and aromatic.</li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until chicken has lost 
    its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Stock</b> and bring back to a 
    boil. Simmer about 10 minutes until chicken is done.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Noodles</b> and bring back to a boil. Add <b>Hot Water</b> 
    as needed to get the consistency you want.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring back to a simmer. 
    Turn off heat and stir in <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. You'll need tongs for serving because the noodles tend 
    to clump and you'll need to separate them. Chopsticks are best for 
    eating this dish.</li>
  <li>If you have leftovers, just put them in an open casserole in the 
    oven and turn up to 325&deg;F/160&deg;C. It's done when bubbling 
    well - delicious!

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh Asian noodles if possible, and of 
  a thin size since cooking time will be very short. If you use dried 
  noodles, use 4 oz and soak in warm water for at least 20 minutes 
  to make 8 oz.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless / boneless meat. I use 
  thigh/leg meat because American breast meat is rather dry and 
  flavorless.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Turmeric:</h3> &nbsp; If you can get fresh turmeric root use about 
  1 t chopped fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; A Chili Puya, or a Guajillo about 5 inches long 
  work well and add just a touch of chili heat. These are similar to the 
  Thai Prik Kaeng used in the region.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Consistency:</h3> will vary widely depending on the noodles used. 
  Some absorb large amounts of water and will make the recipe dry and 
  stiff, with others you may end up with a "noodle stew" - less of a 
  problem than dry and stiff. If too dry add boiling water as needed.
