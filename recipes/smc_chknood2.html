This recipe is in the style of street food, which means it can be mostly 
prepared in advance, finishes up very quickly and is served immediately. 
The given garnish is quite nice, but simpler garnishes can be used.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min / 50 min with garnish)
  <ol>
  <li>Put <b>NOODLES</b> in a heatproof bowl. Bring plenty of water to a 
    boil and pour over the noodles. Let noodles soak for 20 minutes - if 
    they soak longer it won't hurt them. Drain well, then lay out on your 
    cutting board and make a few cuts through the pile to so the noodles 
    are shorter and more manageable.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHICKEN</b> thin and cut into narrow strips.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fairly fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise, then thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Chili Paste</b> and <b>Stock</b> (or water), 
    </li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for both noodles and garnish.</li>
  <li><u>Prepare Garnish</u> (if used): Dry roast <b>PEANUTS</b> in a pan 
    over moderate heat stirring until lightly browned all over (see 
    <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>). Chop 
    <b>CHILI</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> with the flat side of your 
    prep knife, then cut crosswise coarse. Heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Chili</b> and <b>Garlic</b> stirring until garlic starts to 
    color, then stir in <b>Peanuts</b> until coated with oil. Keep warm 
    or rewarm when needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry  
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until well blended and aromatic, then stir in 
    <b>Shallots</b> and fry stirring until soft but not at all browned.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until chicken has lost 
    its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce mix</b> and and bring back to a boil. Simmer 
    covered about 8 minutes until chicken is done.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Noodles</b> just long enough so they're hot and well 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat. Sprinkle with <b>Cilantro</b> and <b>Lime Juice</b> 
    and stir it in.</li>
  <li>Distribute to individual serving plates. You'll need tongs for 
    serving because the noodles tend to clump and you'll need to separate 
    them.</li>
  <li>I like some <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar 
    Sauce</b></a> as a side with this dish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; This is the common thin rice noodles, often 
  called "rice stick". Do not confuse them with mung bean (bean thread) 
  noodles which look much the same when dry. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless / boneless meat. I use 
  thigh/leg meat since American breast meat meat is rather dry and 
  flavorless.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Paste:</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous Huy Fong Chili Garlic 
  sauce, or Sriracha Sauce, will do fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the most important 
  Thai chili pastes. It is available commercially but best made from 
  our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. 
  "Thai Red Chili Sauce" sold by yuppie oulets is not at all the 
  same.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Dry Roasted Peanuts:</h3> &nbsp; Use only raw peanuts and pan 
  roast them yourself  (see our recipe <a href="skv_peanut1.html">
  <b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>). They will be of very different flavor 
  and texture than commercially roasted peanuts (which I don't like at 
  all as a garnish).</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses red ripe Fresnos, but 
  Holland Red, Serrano (hotter) or whatever you have will work. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
