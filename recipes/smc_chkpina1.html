This dish is said to be very popular with children in the Philippines, 
but it will be just as well liked by adults. This dish reheats well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min + Pineapple if fresh)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inch to a side. Toss 
    with the <b>Salt</b> and set aside.</li>
  <li>Carve <b>PINEAPPLE</b> (if fresh) and cut into smallish bite 
    size chunks.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute, quench in cold 
    water, peel, and cut into cubes 1/2 to 3/4 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b>, stirring until Onions are translucent 
    and Garlic bits are lightly browned. Remove <b>Onion mix</b> from 
    the pan, leaving as much oil as you can behind (probably about none).
    </li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and fry <b>Chicken</b>, stirring 
    until lightly browned. Most of the browning may be on the bottom 
    of the pan - don't wory about that, but go to the next step if it 
    starts to become a dark chocolate color.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Onion mix</b> to the pan along with <b>Tomatoes</b>, 
    <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Pineapple</b>. bring to a simmer, cover 
    and simmer for another 15 minutes or until Chicken is tender. 
    Adjust liquid if needed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is for 
  boneless skinless pieces - preferably thigh or leg meat which has 
  much better flavor and texture than the cardboard breasts we get 
  around here.</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Pineapple:</h3> &nbsp; This can be either canned 
  or fresh. If you buy a fresh pineapple it will need to weigh nearly 
  2-1/2 pounds to yield 1 pound clean chunks - depending on your carving 
  skills.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The predominant cooking oil in the Philippines is 
  Coconut oil, but you can use other oils, such as Pure Olive Oil (not 
  Virgin) or the like if you don't have it. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_cocoz.html"><b>Coconut Oil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
