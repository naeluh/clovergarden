  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into convenient size pieces If using whole, bone in 
    chicken parts (legs, thighs) chop each part in half crosswise. A razor 
    sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a soft faced mallet is perfect 
    for this.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b>, cut into about 1 inch cubes. Hold in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Rempah A: &nbsp; Grind <b>Coriander</b> and <b>Cumin</b> in your spice 
    grinder. Mix all <b>Rempah A items</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut slices into matchsticks and chop small.
    </li>
  <li>Peel of tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard root. 
    Smash bottom 5 inches with your kitchen mallet, then slice that 5 inches 
    very thin. Keep aside the lower 4 inches of the unsmashed tops.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>RED CHILIS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>In a <a href="../ke/ke_mixiez.html"><b>Mixie</b></a> or Blender (or 
    large stone Mortar), add <b>Rempah B items</b> <u>in the order listed</u> 
    running them to a paste. Mix in <b>Rempah A mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Open <u>without shaking</u> the <b>Coconut Milk</b>. Spoon off the 
    thick Coconut Cream from the top and hold the Cream separate from the 
    Thin Milk.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO LEAVES</b> medium for Garnish</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-12 qt minimum) heat <b>OIL</b>. 
    Over moderate heat, stir in <b>Rempah mix</b>. Fry stirring constantly 
    until very aromatic and getting dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Cassia Bark</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>. Tumble 
    until well coated with the Rempah.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Thin Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Chicken Stock</b>. It should 
    just cover the Chicken and Potatoes. Stir well to make sure no Rempah is 
    stuck to the pan. Add reserved <b>Lemon Grass Tops</b> and 
    <b>Curry Leaves</b> (if used). Bring to a boil, then turn down heat and 
    simmer covered for 15 minutes. Uncover, and simmer stirring occasionally 
    until chicken is about tender, at least another 15 minutes (10 minutes 
    for boneless chunks).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Cream</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Hold at a high simmer 
    another 15 minutes, uncovered, until chicken is very tender. Adjust 
    liquid as needed for the sauce consistency you want. Note that when you 
    take it off the boil there will be less sauce than you thought, and it 
    will be thicker than you thought.</li>
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Cilantro Leaves</b>, and along with plenty 
    of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is for bone-in pieces (preferably 
  thigh/leg meat) - the photo example uses only drumsticks with the thin 
  end cut off to make stock. The pattern recipe calls for 6 legs (drumsticks 
  & thighs) of free range chicken. Her photo suggests free range chickens are 
  rather small in London. She separates the thighs and legs and cooks them 
  whole and skin-on. Skin-on doesn't work well with our larger, fattier market 
  chickens, so I cook skins and off cuts into a strong both (see 
  <a href="smc_chkpot1.html#08"><b>Stock</b></a>) to be added to the recipe. For buffet 
  service, I'd use skinless boneless leg meat cut into largish chunks.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they turn to mush 
  if cooked a little more than the minimum. The pattern recipe calls for 
  Maris Piper, which are not available in North America, and I think not 
  as suitable for stews as White Rose. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Southeast Asian curry powders are lighter 
  and fruitier than typical Indian curry powders. For an easy to make 
  example see our recipe <a href="sys_curryp1.html"><b>Singapore 
  Curry Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Shallots:</h3> &nbsp; Shallots are the red onion of Southeast Asia. 
  For the photo example I had to use a Red Onion, because another recipe had 
  just used all 14 ounces of Shallots I had on hand. Fortunately, our shallots 
  are much easier to use than tiny Asian Shallots. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_shallotz.html"><b>Shallots</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili, Red Fresh:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "4 fresh 
  medium hot Dutch chillies". Around here, we use Red Fresnos which are much 
  more available. I used 2 large ones, easily equivalent to 4 Holland Reds.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Chilis - Thailand 
  and Southeast Asia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cassia Bark:</h3> This is just the hard sticks that pass as "Cinnamon" 
  in the USA. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html">
  <b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This is a 14 or 15 ounce can of 
  <u>unsweetened</u> coconut milk, preferably from Thailand - that from 
  other countries often disappoints. I always use Aroy-D brand, which has 
  a very high Coconut Cream content. Some other Thai brands may also work 
  well.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Stock of Broth:</h3> &nbsp; When I do a recipe of this sort, I make 
  sure there is enough so I can make a broth. I use skins, fat (a lot of 
  flavor in fat is water soluble), bones and off cuts. In this case I 
  used the skins and the thin ends of the drumsticks. I strain out the 
  solids and use my gravy separator to remove all the fat.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Curry Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; a couple of Kaffir Lime leaves could also be 
  used. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html">
  <b>Curry Leaf</b></a> and  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html">
  <b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> pages. The pattern recipe indicates Curry Leaves 
  as optional.</li>
