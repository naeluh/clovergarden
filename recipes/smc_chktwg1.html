Very flavorful and satisfying Chicken Wings. Not so sweet and sticky as most, 
but delicious. See also <a href="smc_chktwg1.html#04"><b>Comments</b></a>, and

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min + marinating time)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN WINGS</b>. Separate Drummetts, Wingetts, Tips. Best 
    way is to drive a sharp Chinese Cleaver Knife through the joints with a 
    soft faced mallet. Freeze tips to use when making Chicken Broth.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Crush <b>GINGER</b> and chop 
    very fine. Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Divide <b>Sauce</b> in half.</li>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, massage 1/2 the <b>Sauce</b> into the 
    <b>Chicken wings</b>. Let sit for an hour or two, if you have time, 
    tumbling now and then.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> and <b>SCALLIONS</b> small for Garnish. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Preheat Oven to 400&deg;F / 200&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Line a Baking Sheet with Aluminum Foil and place a Wire Rack over it.
    Arrange <b>Chicken Wings</b> on the rack, best side down. Our example 
    <a href="../ke/kp_bakhalf.html"><b>Baking Sheet &amp; Wire Rack</b></a> 
    is just large enough for a double recipe (4 pounds).</li>
  <li>Roast in the oven for about 50 minutes. Turn Wings best side up about 
    half way through.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Place the other half of the sauce in a sauce pan and 
    simmer uncovered until reduced by about half.</li>
  <li>When Wings have roasted 50 minutes, baste with some of the reduced 
    sauce and continue to roast another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Arrange wings on a plate (or plates) and drizzle the remaining sauce 
    over. Garnish with <b>Cilantro mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, with <u>lots</u> of paper napkins, and finger bowls wouldn't 
    be out of order.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for Drummetts and/or Wingettes, exclusive 
  of Tips. The tips from 2 pounds of joints weigh 4 ounces.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Some other Southeast Asian sauce such 
  as Sriracha (sweeter) could also be used. <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html">
  <b>Huy Fong</b></a> brand will be fine for either.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Palm Sugar would also be fine. If you haven't 
  either, use a light brown sugar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can also be done on an outdoor 
  grill. The amount of sugar in this recipe is half what most recipes call 
  for - increase if you wish. Asians are sugar junkies, and there's just so 
  much sweet I can stand. This recipe can be reheated in a 300&deg;F / 
  150&deg;C oven.</li>
