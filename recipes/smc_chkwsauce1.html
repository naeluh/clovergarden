  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick slices about 1-1/2 
    to 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide (or whatever you can do with the 
    chicken you have). Slice <b>CHICKEN LIVERS</b> similarly and massage 
    both together with <b>Soy Sauce</b> Set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise, then crosswise into thin 
    slices. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GREENS</b> into fairly large pieces, perhaps 2 inches long. 
    Cut the stems on a diagonal 1 to 1-1/2 inches depending on 
    thickness.</li>

  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally into 1 inch lengths, white and 
    green.</li>

    up and fry stirring until it has lost its raw color.</li>

    mix</b> and bring to a simmer. Simmer covered for about 4 minutes.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless and boneless. I favor 
  thigh/leg meat for flavor and texture, but breast can be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Asian Greens:</h3> &nbsp; The recipe calls for <i>pak kwang 
  tung</i>, which is insufficient definition. 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_yuchz.html"><b>Yu Choy</b></a> (Pak Kwang Tung 
  Dok) and <a href="../ingred/cb_boksz.html#shang"><b>Shanghai Bok 
  Choy</b></a> (Pak Kwang Tung Hong Tae - sold in supermarkets as "
  Baby Bok Choy") are the leading candidates and either may be used. 
  Down in the text it says "mustard greens", which would indicate 
  Yu Choy, a form of mustard green. For further details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pineapple</h3> &nbsp; I keep a few small 8-oz cans of pineapple 
  slices around so I don't have to butcher a whole pineapple every time 
  a recipe calls for a few ounces. Not as good as fresh, though, 
  unfortunately.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Straw Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Unfortunately, these will be canned. 
  Unpeeled are best for this recipe but peeled will also work since they 
  are added very late in the recipe. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/fu_strawz.html"><b>Straw Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; My version uses half the sugar the original 
  calls for, and that's plenty.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chili Vinegar Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This condiment is an essential on 
  the Thai table. Make ahead at least a few days if you can. For recipe 
  see our  <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar 
  Sauce</b></a>. Serve it in a small bowl with a small spoon for thise 
  who want it.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I read the ingredients for this recipe and it 
  sounded interesting, so I got them together and started reading the 
  instructions. Surprise! The instructions didn't mention many 
  of the ingredients but did mention at least one that wasn't on the list 
  - and the ingredients were not in order of use or preparation, but 
  seemingly random. The photograph didn't quite match either, but was a 
  sufficient guide to piece this thing together. Sheeesh! I expect this 
  sort of nonsense in cookbooks from India, but from a 30 year college 
  instructor (Thailand and Hawaii) and the Thai chef of a Berkeley 
  restaurant?
  <p> I did change the order a bit to improve flow and flavor, and added 
  some fish sauce (how could it be Thai without fish sauce?).  The pattern 
  recipe was intended to be served restaurant style Khao Rat Na (single 
  potion spooned over a mound of rice) and had twice as much sauce, but I 
  find my amount is plenty for normal table service (and their photo had 
  even less).</p></li>
