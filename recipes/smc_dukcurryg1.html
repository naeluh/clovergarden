Rich and delicious!  My way, using duck legs, may not be how they 
do it in Thailand (they just chop a duck into pieces), but it works for 
me - less fat when cooking and it's a lot easier to serve and eat.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Skin and bone <b>DUCK LEGS</b> removing all fat.  Reserve bones 
    for stock.</li>
  <li>Cut the skins and fat into small pieces, put them in an iron 
    skillet and fry them slowly until lightly browned and crisp. Eat the 
    cracklings with a little salt and save the duck fat for cooking - 
    neither is used in this recipe.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Duck Meat</b> into bite size pieces about 1/4 inch thick.
    </li>
  <li>Open <b>Coconut Milk</b> without shaking. Spoon the <b>Coconut 
    Cream</b> off the top of both cans until you have 2/3 cup. Keep 
    separate from the milk.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>BASIL</b> small and keep soaking in cold water until needed.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHILIS</b> into slivers. Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small. Mix.
    </li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Coconut Cream</b> over 
    moderate heat. Stir until the coconut oil starts to separate from 
    the solids - it will get a very glossy appearance.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Green Curry Paste</b> and fry stirring until it is well 
    distributed and aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Duck</b> until well coated, then stir in 
    <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Lime Leaves</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for about 1 
    hour, stirring occasionally, until duck is tender. If the sauce 
    starts to thicken too much, cover and turn the heat down a little.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> and simmer a few more minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Basil</b>, stir in and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Let sit for a couple minutes, then tilt the pan to pool the oil and 
    use a shallow spoon to remove the excess. Not all of it - It's duck, 
    it's supposed to be rich.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Duck Legs:</h3> &nbsp; 1-1/2 pounds will yield about 12 ounces of 
  skinless boneless meat. Legs are easily available frozen in the Asian 
  (East or Southeast) markets. You could also use breasts but they're 
  hard to find and expensive around here because they all go to the 
  restaurant trade. For breasts use about 1-1/4 pound to get 12 ounces.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This amount makes for a curry that's not 
  too hot. If you don't have Thai, green arbols are good, or a single 
  largish serrano - or use your own judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Best made at home by our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_grncurry1.html"><b>Green Curry Paste</b></a>. "Thai 
  Green Curry Sauce" sold in yuppie outlets is not suitable.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
