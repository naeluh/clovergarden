A very popular dish in the Philippines, particularly for breakfast.  
We non-Filipinos are more likely to serve it for dinner. This page 
deals with a bangus already prepared ready for frying by a Philippine 
market.

If you want to start with a whole, uncut Bangus, or debone a store 
bought one, the instructions and photos on Tina's page

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min minimum, 1 day max - 
    see steps and notes)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare your <b>BANGUS</b>. This page starts with a fish already 
    prepared for frying by a Philippine market, but you can start with 
    an uncut fish (see <a href="smf_daibang1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you have a store prepared fish, you may still want to 
    marinate it for a few hours because the store marinade tends to be 
    quite a bit on the weak side. You also may wish to debone it 
    (see <a href="smf_daibang1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) as 
    described in 
    <a href="http://www.pinaycookingcorner.com/2012/02/daing-na-bangus-milkfish-marinated-in.html">
    <b>Tina's article</b></a> or on our 
    <a href="../ingred/sf_milkb.html"><b>Deboning a Bangus</b></a> page. 
    </li>
  <li>For <u>Marinade</u>: &nbsp; Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. 
    Mix with <b>Vinegar</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Bangus</b> in 6 pieces (serving size) if desired. The photo 
    specimen was fried whole, but that took a 15 inch iron skillet, not 
    available in most American households. A whole fish could be 
    marinated in a sealed plastic bag, but a cut fish can be marinated 
    in an available glass or ceramic baking pan (do not use aluminum).
    </li>
  <li>Marinate <b>Bangus</b> refrigerated for at least 3 hours, or 
    preferably overnight for a freshly cut fish, or, optionally, about 3 
    hours for a store prepared fish.</ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain the <b>Bangus</b> and pat dry with paper towels. Discard the 
    marinade.</li>
  <li>In a cast iron or other quality skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> very hot 
    but not smoking. Start frying fish <u>skin side down</u>, and when 
    nice and crisp, turn the fish over and fry the skinless side. The 
    skinless side can be fried quite a bit lighter than the photo 
    specimen if desired.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, accompanied by a Vinegar Dip, Rice (steamed or fried) and 
    a salad, or however you please.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bangus:</h3> &nbsp; [Milkfish]. Weight given is for a market 
  prepared bangus. The 1-1/2 pound photo specimen was purchased ready 
  for frying from a Philippine market in Los Angeles, 2014 US $2.79 /
   pound. &nbsp; <b>IF</b> you're starting with a whole 
  fish (see 
  <a href="http://www.pinaycookingcorner.com/2012/02/daing-na-bangus-milkfish-marinated-in.html">
  <b>Tina's article</b></a>), select one between 1-3/4 and 2 pounds. Note 
  that in neither case is the fish scaled. The skin and scales are 
  entirely edible if it is fried nice and crisp on the skin side. For 
  details on Bangus see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_milkz.html"><b>Milkfish / Bangus</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use one of the fine vinegars 
  imported from the Philippines. Tina (see link above) uses 1/2 regular 
  Cane Vinegar and 1/2 Spicy Cane Vinegar. Coconut or Palm vinegar are 
  also fine. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
  <b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Deboning:</h3> &nbsp; I fried the photo specimen  without deboning 
  at all. I recently enjoyed an American Shad and often enjoy Carp. Both 
  are more of a pin bone problem than Bangus, so dealing with the pin 
  bones is no problem for me. &nbsp; Note: &nbsp; I always eat fish with 
  pointy chopsticks, which gives me a very high degree of control (I eat 
  most Chinese dishes with a fork, barbarian that I am). If you serve 
  without deboning, provide napkins and a plate on which to deposit the 
  pin bones and other bones.</li>
