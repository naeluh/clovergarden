Mackerel is a prized fish through most of the world, but it's an oily 
fish (lots of Omega 3) and many Americans consider it too strong in 
flavor. I quite like mackerel and find this a very fine light curry.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>MACKEREL</b> (if you didn't have the fish guy do it) and 
    cut to prepare for cooking (see <a href="smf_fishcurryi1.html#01">Note-1</a>). Crosswise 
    into sections about 1-1/2 inch long is good. Authentically you should 
    include the head in the curry (be sure to pull out the gills) but 
    you may not wish to be that authentic.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Roast <b>CUMIN SEEDS</b> in a dry skillet until fragrant, cool and 
    grind fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TURMERIC ROOT</b>, <b>CHILIS</b>, <b>SHALLOTS</b> and 
    <b>GARLIC</b> fine. Crush into a paste in a large mortar, adding in 
    the order given. If you have to use a miniprep food processor or some 
    such device you may have to add 1/2 t of water or so.</li>
  <li>Crack <b>NUTMEG</b> open and use one half. Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> into 
    thick slices and bruise them with a kitchen mallet. Tie <b>Pandanus 
    Leaf</b> into a knot. Mix all with <b>Cassia Stick</b> and <b>Cloves</b>.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 30 min cook, 30 min rest)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>OIL</b> over medium heat and 
    stir fry <b>Curry Paste</b> until aromatic but not at all browned, 
    then stir in <b>Aromatics Mix</b> and fry stirring until aromatic 
    (1 to 2 minutes).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and fry stirring until well coated, then add 
    <b>Water</b> and <b>Coconut Milk</b>. Simmer until Potatoes are just 
    tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mackerel</b> and cook stirring occasionally until just 
    cooked through (5 to 7 minutes). Stir in <b>Palm Sugar</b> (if used) 
    and <b>Cumin</b> along with <b>Salt</b> to taste. If you have time, 
    let sit 30 minutes to mature flavors and reheat just before serving 
    You can use this time to make your rice.</li>
  <li>Remove whole Aromatics and serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mackerel:</h3> &nbsp; Atlantic Mackerel is my favorite (and the 
  fvorite of sushi bars) but Pacific / Japanese / Chub Mackerel will 
  work fine - or Pacific Sierra if you want a milder mackerel. In 
  Indonesia they just clean out the guts and cut the fish crosswise, but 
  most Americans are not accustomed to dealing with bony fish in that 
  form. For this reason I cut off the head and cut out the dorsal fins, 
  then split the fish   into two halves by pulling out the backbone. 
  The ribs also pull very easily. Also pull out the centerline pin bones 
  with long nose pliers - they are easy to feel and pull out. Then cut 
  into into convenient pieces. For more on mackerel see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_mackz.html"><b>Mackerel</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; medium potatoes like White 
  Rose work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes 
  which turn to mush with long simmering. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
<h3>Turmeric root:</h3> &nbsp; yellow turmeic, not white. If you don't 
  have fresh turmeric substitute 1/2 t dried turmeric.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Two of these make a curry with a 
  noticeable bite, particularly in the finish, but it's mild by 
  Southern California standards - use your own best judgement. A good 
  substitute would be one chili serrano, not as hot but larger. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">Thai Chilis</a>.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> looks sort of like Ginger Root but is much harder. 
  Find in Southeast Asian markets, fresh or frozen. If you just can't get 
  it use Ginger Root (different but workable). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Pandanus:</h3> this leaf, found frozen in Southeast Asian and 
  Pacific groceries, often labeled "Bai Toey", contributes a vanilla-like 
  flavor. If you can't get it, leave it out.  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pd_pandan.html"><b>Pandanus - Screwpine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Cassia:</h3> &nbsp; not a problem - what's called "Cinnamon 
  sticks" in the U.S. is actually Cassia, not Cinnamon. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> 
  page.</li>
