With the vegies and rice, a  4-1/2 ounce fish fillet should be enough for 
most people. The ginger vegies are so tasty you could almost skip the 
fish.

This is an elegant dish for two, but would be difficult to manage for 
more than four. Have everything ready and work quickly so the vegetables 
are minimally cooked.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILETS</b> into your preferred serving size and pat 
    dry.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b>. Remove thread-like roots if you want 
    to be a perfectionist.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>GINGER</b> and peel if needed. Slice crosswise very thin, 
    then slice into narrow slivers.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOM</b> in warm water for at least 1/2 hour. Stem, cut 
    in half and slice halves thin at right angles.</li>
  <li>Blast the <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your propane torch and 
    rub off the skin under running water.  Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half 
    lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 
    1/4 inch lengths.  Slice <b>CHILI</b> thin. Mix all <b>Aromatics 
    items</b>, including <b>Mushroom</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium small for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a well seasoned iron skillet, start heating about 1/16th inch 
    of oil so it is nearly at frying temperature when the vegies are 
    done (5 minutes).</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> over medium heat and 
    fry <b>Ginger</b>, stirring until aromatic but not browned, then stir 
    in <b>Aromatics mix</b>.  Fry stirring for just a couple minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bean Sprouts</b>, then <b>Sauce mix</b>. Bring quickly 
    to a boil, stir, then set aside, covered to keep warm. Both Bean 
    Sprouts and Bell Pepper should still have some crunch to them.</li>
  <li>Dust fish lightly with <b>Rice Flour</b> and fry both sides 
    until very lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Spread <b>Vegies</b> on plates and top with <b>Fish</b>. Garnish 
    with <b>Cilantro</b> and serve warm, with steamed Jasmine Rice on 
    the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; My preferred fish for this recipe is Pompano, 
  but many other light or medium fish that aren't too thick will work 
  fine. The photo is with Black Pomfret, but I  have also made it with 
  Tilapia. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very 
  large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; Mung Bean Sprouts are almost always 
  called for in Thai cooking, but I prefer Soybean Sprouts for this 
  recipe (see photo), because they have more flavor and are more 
  durable in cooking. Soybean Sprouts are most used in Korea, but do 
  see significant use throughout Southeast Asia and southern China. 
  Korean markets sometimes have them with the root ends conveniently 
  cut off.</li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red or similar will be fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Asian practice does not require the stock to 
  match the main ingredient, so Chicken or Pork stocks will work fine, 
  with Chicken most commonly used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
