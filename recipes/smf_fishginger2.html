This recipe "in the Chinese style" is intensely flavorful but not 
"hot" because medium strength chilis are used and seeded before slicing. If 
you want you can hotten it up a bit with one or two Thai chilis.

The photo shows cut fish fillets, but you could also do a whole fish on 
a platter with sauce poured over, as is often done in Asia - impressive, 
but a lot more trouble for serving and eating.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILETS</b> into pieces as desired - half serving size 
    is good.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> (3/4 ounce is about 6) in warm water for at 
    least 1/2 hour, then wring out, discard stems and cut caps into narrow 
    strips.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine, peel <b>SHALLOTS</b> and slice 
    thin. Mix both with <b>Mushrooms</b>.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and cut into fine slivers. Top and seed 
    <b>CHILIS</b> and cut into slivers. Split white ends of 
    <b>SCALLIONS</b> and cut into 1 inch lengths. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with 1 T <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Grind <b>Salt</b> fine and mix with <b>Rice Flour</b> on a plate.</li>
  <li>In a well seasoned iron skillet heat <b>Oil</b> for frying - depth 
    about 1/4 to 1/3 the thickness of the fish is fine. Dust the fish pieces 
    lightly with the <b>Rice Flour</b> and fry on both sides until cooked 
    through and lightly browned - keep in mind that with rice flour "browned" 
    means "light blonde". Drain on paper toweling and keep warm.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over medium heat and fry 
    <b>Mushroom mix</b> stirring until aromatic and showing a touch of 
    color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger mix</b> and fry stirring for a minute, then stir 
    in the <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Cornstarch mix</b> and simmer stirring until sauce is 
    thickened. Adjust thickness with water if needed - it shouldn't be too 
    thick if you're serving with rice.</li>
  <li>Serve <b>Fish</b> with the <b>Sauce</b> ladled over, along with plenty 
    of jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; This works well with mild or medium flavor fish 
  that cooks firm, like yellowtail, jacks, pompano, etc. I usually use 
  Thai catfish (basa, swai) or talapia. If you go the whole fish route 
  you'll want a fish that weighs about 1-1/2 pound and make diagonal 
  slashes half way through the flesh spaced about 3/4 inch apart.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red or similar chilis are fine. A red Anaheim would be good, and they 
  are becoming more common here in Southern California. For details, see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
