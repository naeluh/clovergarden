This very tasty dish is quick and easy to make (once you've cleaned the 
fish). Americans aren't accustomed to dealing with small bony fish but 
it's not difficult to learn (<a href="smf_fishphilip1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) - or you 
could use fillets instead.

<p>In the Philippines the fish would likely be cooked head-on, but for 
simplicity, and to fit pans and dishes, I remove the heads. Also, 
some Americans are not used to dinner staring back at them.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>FISH</b> and discard heads. Arrange in a saut&eacute; 
    pan just large enough to fit as one layer.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Vinegar</b>,<b>Water</b>.</li>
  <li>Sliver <b>CHILIS</b> lengthwise, slice <b>GINGER</b> thin and chop 
    very fine. Add both to pan along with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil and simmer about 5 minutes. Add <b>Coconut Cream</b>, 
    stirring it around as much as possible without breaking up the fish. 
    Bring back to a simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>There will be a lot of sauce so serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mackerel Scad:</h3> &nbsp; This fish, often called "round scad", 
  is the traditional fish for this dish. It is milder and much less oily 
  than real mackerel and comes in sizes from 7 to 17 inches. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sf_scadmz.html"><b>Mackerel Scad</b></a> 
  page. Scad are related to Jacks and Pompanos, so those could be 
  considered as substitutes, but don't use a fish that's too mild. 
  Various Scad are generally in good supply in markets serving a 
  Philippine community. For more fish choices see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> (very large 
  page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Philippine Long Chili, but 
  those aren't much available even in Southern California, so substitute 
  some other not too hot green chili, such as Japanese Shishito, Korean 
  or milder Indian. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eating Small Fish:</h3> lift off and eat chunks of the upper side 
  of the fish taking care not to disturb the very top edge of the fish 
  which is full of fin spines. Watch for tiny ribs you may encounter in 
  the body cavity area. When the first half is eaten move the narrow 
  strip at the very top of the fish away from the body - it'll 
  take all those fin spines with it. Lift off the backbone and tail. Pick 
  out any tiny ribs in the body cavity area and eat the second side of 
  the fish. Chopsticks are the best tool for disassembling and eating 
  fish if you handle them well. Chinese chopsticks for larger fish and 
  Japanese for smaller.</li>
