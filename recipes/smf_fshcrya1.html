  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare your fish. Scale (not needed for Mackerel), remove heads and 
  tails, clean, remove skin (not needed for Mackerel or Sardines, optional 
  for Trout). &nbsp; (time varies)</li>
  <li>If not on hand, make <a href="sys_curpmf1.html"><b>Malay Curry Powder 
    - Fish</b></a>. It is very important to use the right Curry Powder for 
    this recipe. &nbsp; (10 minutes)</li>
    </ol> 
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut <b>FISH:</b> into largish bite size chunks, or as you prefer. </li>
  <li>If using block form <b>TAMARIND</b>, chop as best you can and soak in 
    1/2 cup of hot water for at least 30 minutes. Press through a wire 
    strainer and discard solids.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop medium.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>OKRA</b> with 1 T vinegar and let soak for 20 minutes (helps 
    them stay intact and not slimy, but not too long or they get stiff). Then 
    rinse and cut off the cap and cut crosswise diagonally into 2 equal weight 
    pieces.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANT</b> into medium bite size pieces. Hold in cold water 
    acidulated with a bit of Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until needed.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, cut 
    slices into threads and chop threads fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Curry Powder</b> with 3 T <b>Water</b> to make a slurry.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Tempering items</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in 
    <b>Tempering mix</b>. Careful, the Curry Leaves will snap and spit for 
    a few seconds. When the Mustard Seeds are popping well, stir in 
    <b>Onion</b> and fry stirring until just starting to become translucent. 
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b> and fry stirring for another minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Curry Powder Slurry</b> and continue to fry stirring often 
    until it starts to get glossy from the oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Sugar</b> (if using), 
    <b>Tomatoes</b>, and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b>, <b>Okra</b>, and drained <b>Eggplant</b>. Bring 
    back to a simmer. Simmer covered for about 10 minutes. Take off the heat.
    </li>   
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. Because of its liquid 
    and light vegetables, a main dish serving can be 10 or 11 ounces rather 
    than the usual 8 ounces. This dish reheats well, but keep the reheating 
    brief.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for Fish made recipe ready. Mackerel is the 
    preferred fish, but other oily fish can be used, including fresh Tuna, 
    fresh Bonito, fresh sardines, or even trout. Either Fillets, Mackerel 
    Steaks or Tuna / Bonito Chunks can be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 2 T, or if it's block use about 2 T, soak and strain. If you don't 
  have tamarind use 1 T lemon juice - not the same, but it's something. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible use one of the narrow 
  eggplants that don't need to be peeled, Chinese, Japanese, etc. If all you 
  have is the large purple blimps, you will have to peel.  For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a Malaysian Fish Curry Powder. 
  This is different from the curry powder used for Meat and Poultry. It is 
  very important the right Curry Powder be used for this dish. See our 
  recipe <a href="sys_curpmf1.html"><b>Malay Curry Powder - Fish</b></a>. 
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mustard Seeds:</h3> &nbsp; This is the Indian temperature gage. 
  Black Mustard Seeds are always used. If you have only Yellow, they 
  will work but pop more violently and at a slightly lower temperature.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India (and some Southeast Asia), and are now 
  reasonably available in Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here 
  in California. Dried ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them 
  yourself within a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to 
  leave them out - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; (Optional) Asians are Sugar Junkies. There is no way 
  I could stand the 1-1/2 Tablespoons called for in the pattern recipe, in 
  fact, for my taste, even less han 1/2 T is fine, or even none.</li>
