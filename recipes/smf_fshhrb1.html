A delicious dish of fresh water fish, with plenty of flavorful herbs, 
especially good for warm summer days. It cooks very quickly, and is also 
very healthful with little oil and all fresh ingredients.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Kachin State is at the top of Burma, between 
  India and China, so fresh water fish is in order for this recipe. 
  The pattern recipe suggested Carp, Tilapia and Pickerel. I used Asian 
  Catfish, which is popular with all the river peoples - BUT - I 
  consider the Swai fillets sold in practically every fish department 
  in California <u>Unsuitable</u>!  They have been prepared with great 
  skill to have almost no fish flavor at all. I buy Asian Catfish frozen 
  as whole fish minus head and guts, and cook them skin-on. If you can't 
  get those, you're far better off with American Channel Catfish or 
  Tilapia. The first suggestion, Carp, is a problem. While outright 
  delicious, and the most heavily farmed fish in the world, Americans 
  haven't learned to deal with the thread bones that are found through 
  the flesh. For details, see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; The patern recipe calls for "2 green 
  Cayenne chilis", but no such thing is available in North America (and 
  what is a "cayenne chili" is uncertain). I suggest 2 Thai Green Chilis, 
  or 1/2 a Serrano. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rau Ram:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important herb in Southeast Asia. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_rauramz.html">
  <b>Rau Ram</b></a> page. The Asian markets I shop at <u>always</u> 
  have Rau Ram - except the day I needed it for this recipe. I used 
  Watercress.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Culantro:</h3> &nbsp; [Sawtooth Herb] &nbsp; This herb from the 
  Americas is now very important in Southeast Asia. It can be found in 
  markets serving an Asian or Latin American community. Fresh Cilantro is 
  a defective substitute, but as close as you're going to get. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Again, the patern recipe calls for "2 
  green Cayenne chilis", but no such thing is available in North America 
  (and what is a "cayenne chili" is uncertain). I suggest 1 whole 
  Serrano. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Peanut Oil, which 
  is popular in Burma, but Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) will work fine.
  </li>
