  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOT</b> fine. Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b> and mix

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; In Vietnam, Vietnamese Catfish are most used, 
  but Snakeheads are also sometimes used. Both these fish can be found 
  in Asian markets here in North America. The Catfish is easier to use - 
  <u>but</u> the common Swai fillets are not very good for this recipe. 
  They have been very skillfully trimmed to remove almost all flavor - 
  you would be better off using American Channel Catfish. You can also 
  use Walking Catfish, sold as "Yellow Catfish" here in Southern 
  California. I buy frozen Swai / Basa with head removed and gutted. 
  <u>Note</u>: Vietnamese Catfish have a lot of belly fat, which should 
  be trimmed off. Many recipes in English recommend Cod, but in extensive 
  testing, cod was the least acceptable (compared to Catfish, Grouper 
  and Halibut). For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> (very large page). </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; This relative of Ginger can be found in most 
  Asian markets, fresh or frozen. If you don't have it, use 1-1/2 T 
  Ginger and increase the Shallot to compensate. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Juice:</h3> &nbsp; This is a substitute to provide a sour 
  note which would be provided by <i>me</i> (fermented rice) in 
  Vietnam. Some recipes suggest Yogurt or Sour Cream, but I prefer to 
  avoid dairy in Southeast Asian recipes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Turmeric:</h3> &nbsp; Some cooks use a mix of fresh and powdered 
  Turmeric, but fresh is messy and not available everywhere in North 
  America.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Usa a Thai or Vietnamese shrimp paste. 
  I usually use the Thai with oil. If you object to shrimp paste, use 1/2 
  Tablespoon of Fish Sauce. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Use thin Rice Noodles (often called 
  "Rice Stick"). <u>Don't</u> confuse these with Mung Bean Noodles which 
  look a lot the same dry but their cooking properties are very 
  different. For details see our <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html">
  <b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In restaurants in Vietnam, 
  the fish is pre-grilled. A gas burner would be brought to the table 
  with a skillet. The Herbs, Grilled Fish, Garnishes, Dipping Sauce and 
  Rice Noodles would all be provided separately. The herbs and fish would 
  be fried in the pan just until hot. Each diner would place some Noodles 
  in their bowl, then some Fish/Herb mix, top it with Garnishes and eat 
  with Dipping Sauce. In the home it can just be finished and assembled 
  onto individual plates and served, or assembled on a hot cast iron 
  fajita plate and brought to the table. &nbsp; <b>The Big Problem</b> 
  here is <b>Women</b>. When something <u>has to be served right now</u> 
  that's exactly when they excuse themselves to the lady's room and don't 
  return for 10 to 20 minutes - <u>especially if they have been told</u> 
  how critical the serving time is.</li>
