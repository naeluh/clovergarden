This mildly tart fish dish is very popular in the Philippines, the 
world capital for cooking with vinegar. As are many Philippine dishes, 
it's simple and easy to make.  See <a href="smf_fshpak1.html#06"><b>Variations</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; If you use whole fish, you will need about 2-1/4 
  pounds for the same amount of meat. This dish is most often made with 
  Bangus steaks or whole small fish, just scaled and cleaned, beheaded 
  or not. Fillets of larger fish are also used, and are better when 
  serving less experienced fish eaters. The important thing is that the 
  fish hold together well with wet cooking. The most commonly used fish 
  is <a href="../ingred/sf_milkz.html"><b>Bangus</b></a> (Milkfish) cut 
  into steaks, followed by <a href="../ingred/sf_scadmz.html">
  <b>Galunggong</b></a> (Mackerel Scad) cooked whole, but other small 
  Philippine fish are also used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Amaplaya] &nbsp; This should be the 
  Chinese style with wavy bumps, not the Indian with sharp pointy bumps, 
  and should be very firm and dark green. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Mahaba:</h3> &nbsp; This is a long, narrow chili that is 
  relatively mild. For details and substitutions see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a genuine Philippine vinegar, 
  available from Philippine markets. The photo example was made with 
  Palm Vinegar, but Cane or Coconut vinegars could also be used. Lacking 
  one of those, use white wine vinegar or distilled white vinegar - but 
  cut them about 1/4 with water as they are more harsh. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; [Patis] &nbsp; This clear liquid 
  is as essential to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. 
  If you are unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Variations</h3> &nbsp; The ingredients for this dish vary little,  
  but proportions and method do. Some recipes substitute Eggplant for the 
  Ampalaya, some use 1/2 each, and some omit both. Some recipes cook the 
  fish in the broth without vegetables, age it in the fridge for 2 days, 
  then finish it with the vegetables. Others suggest letting the finished 
  stew rest for a few hours, then reheating. Some recipes cook the 
  Ampalaya separately to reduce bitterness in the broth (I haven't found 
  this a problem). The ratio of Vinegar to Water is all over the map.</li>
