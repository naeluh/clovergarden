Mackerel is a prized eating fish in Southeast Asia. This dish is 
traditionally cooked in the embers of the kitchen fire, but that isn't 
practical for most of us (see <a href="smf_fshpapa1.html#11"><b>Cooking</b></a>).

This is not a dish for a family dinner, but great to unobtrusively 
demonstrate your leet skillz, if you have taken the time to develop them 
(see <a href="smf_fshpapa1.html#12"><b>Serving</b></a>).

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean and behead <b>MACKEREL</b> as needed. I also remove the tails 
    so they fit the pan and serving dish better. Wash thoroughly with 
    warm water.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Juice the <b>LIME</b>, then rub Mackerel inside and out with 
    <b>Lime Juice</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Rinse.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GREEN PAPAYA</b>. Slice about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 
    pieces about 1 inch on a side.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Aromatics</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut grungy parts from <b>GALANGAL</b> and slice as thin as you can 
    (see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page 
    for how to slice it easily). Slice <b>GINGER</b> thick. No need to 
    peel either as they will be strained out. Mix and pound in a Mortar 
    until well bruised.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b> and <b>GARLIC</b>. Cut Shallots in half 
    lengthwise and crush Garlic with the side of your prep knife. Cap 
    and core <b>CHILIS</b> and chop coarse. Chop <b>CILANTRO ROOTS</b> 
    Coarse. Toss them all into the Mortar and pound until moderately 
    crushed.</li> 
  <li>Remove hard outer layers of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and crush the lower 
    5 inches moderately with with your kitchen mallet. Cut into 1-1/2 
    inch pieces and toss into the Mortar mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Broth</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min - 10 min work)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Chop <b>TAMARIND</b> medium. Crush <b>Palm Sugar</b> Crush 
    <b>Peppercorns</b> lightly. Mix together all <b>Broth items</b> 
    in a saucepan and bring up to a simmer for 5 minutes, or until the 
    Tamarind has dissolved.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Aromatics mix</b> and the <b>Papaya</b>. Bring 
    back to a simmer for another 5 minutes or so.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 15 min work)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Place <b>Mackerels</b> in a flame proof coverable casserole deeper 
    than they are high (see alternatives 
    <a href="smf_fshpapa1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a>). Bring to a low simmer and simmer 
    very slowly for about 25 minutes (15 minutes if fillets).</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Prepare Garnish. Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b>, 
    cut in half lengthwise and thin crosswise. Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> 
    small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Very carefully remove as much of the vegetables as you can into 
    a strainer with a bowl under to catch the broth. Very Carefully 
    lift out the <b>Mackerels</b> using a wide flat turner. Remove as 
    much debris as you can and place them in a fairly deep oval serving 
    platter. Squeeze <b>Broth</b> out of the solids and strain well. 
    Pour a good portion of it over the Mackerels. Keep the rest hot, 
    you will need it all.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Shallot mix</b> and serve warm (see 
    <a href="smf_fshpapa1.html#12"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mackerel:</h3> &nbsp; I use 2 Mackerels. This weight is for 
  whole fish cleaned and head removed. You will need to buy about 2-1/2 
  pounds of whole fish for this weight. You could also make this dish 
  with fillets, using a weight similar to the cleaned and beheaded fish. 
  This would be less artistic, but much easier to serve, and recommended 
  if serving to folks not accustomed to dealing with fish bones on the 
  plate. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_mackaz.html">
  <b>Atlantic Mackerel</b></a> page, and our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_mackz.html"><b> Mackerel Family</b></a> page 
  for other mackerels.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Papaya:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after peeling and cutting. 
  These are fully unripe papayas. The seeds within are still mostly 
  white and the flesh is a very pale green. Green papayas are widely 
  available in markets serving South and Southeast Asian communities, 
  particularly Filipino. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/br_papaz.html"><b>Papayas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; This member of the Ginger family is available 
  from markets serving a Southeast Asian community. It is an essential 
  ingredient, and can be found fresh or frozen. It is very hard. For 
  details and method of slicing, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red or similar will be fine. Medium hot green chilis could also be used 
  in this recipe. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cilantro Roots:</h3> &nbsp; You probably won't be able to find 
  these, even at farmer's markets - they aren't much used outside of 
  Southeast Asia. The best substitute is thick Cilantro Stems (no 
  leaves), and use a little more.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential ingredient for 
  Southeast Asian cuisines, and has become quite available here in 
  Southern California. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; We don't bother preparing the Tamarind Pulp 
  because it will all be strained out. Second best is 4 T from a jar of 
  concentrate. For details and method, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; This flavorful sugar can be found in any 
  market catering to a Southeast Asian community, and in some Indian 
  markets. If you don't have it, use an amber sugar like Turbinado.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Stock will, of course, make a richer broth than 
  water. Westerners would automatically presume fish stock (but not 
  mackerel), but East and Southeast Asians will often use a stock 
  different from the main ingredient, such as a chicken or pork stock.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="11">
  <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, the dish would be made up in 
  a clay pot, and placed in the embers of the kitchen fire to cook. 
  Today most Thais just simmer it until the broth tastes right. The 
  writer of the pattern recipe makes it up in a covered casserole 
  and leaves it in an oven set at 175&deg;F/80&deg;C for 2 hours so it 
  never comes quite to a simmer. This low temperature keeps the mackerel 
  very tender, the way he likes it, but he admits the Thais don't mind 
  it a little firm, and nor do I. If you don't have an appropriately 
  shaped flame proof casserole, you could make the dish up in a 
  coverable oven proof casserole and hold it in the oven at his 
  temperature for 2 hours, or at a slightly higher temperature for 
  about 1 hour.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Serving:</h3>  &nbsp; Here we presume you have cooked the fish 
  whole, or pan dressed as in the photo - serving fillets is much 
  simpler. After presenting the dish at the table, you can use a fork 
  to fillet the fish right from the serving dish. Be careful not to 
  take the fins. When you have placed fish on a dish, spoon out a good 
  amount of the broth over it and some of the garnish. Once you have 
  removed the fillet on the top side, probably in several pieces, just 
  take hold of the backbone at the head end and pull it off so you can 
  get to the second side. Clear the fins away and serve this fillet with 
  broth and garnish as you did the other. When you are running low on 
  broth, pour on the reserved broth you've been keeping warm. You need 
  to provide each diner with a place to dispose of the rib bones they 
  find in the fillet, and you need a dish for the backbones and fins 
  removed while you're serving. Note that I always eat fish with thin 
  chopsticks (Chinese type) which allows me to easily find and remove 
  any bones as I disassemble the fish on my plate.</li>
