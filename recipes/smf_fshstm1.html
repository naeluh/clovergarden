An entirely delectable (and easy) way to cook moderately flavored fish. 
The dish the fish is steamed in can be the serving 
dish. See <a href="smf_fshstm1x.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>,

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - (exclusive of 
    cleaning the fish))
  <ol>
  <li>Scale and clean <b>FISH</b> as required. Make diagonal cuts to 
    the bone on both sides, spaced about 1 inch apart.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> thin (or dice small if using larger chilis 
    such as Serranos). Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and cut in half lengthwise. 
    Slice <b>CILANTRO ROOT</b> thin. Mix all in a large Mortar and 
    pound just until the Garlic Cloves are broken up fairly small.</li> 
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Set up your Steamer rig (<a href="smf_fshstm1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>) with 
    water and the whatever grid you are using. Cover with a domed lid 
    and bring it up to a full boil (Important).</li>  
  <li>Place fish on a dish with a fairly high rim. Place it on the 
    steamer grid and pour <b>Sauce mix</b> evenly over the fish. Cover 
    with the domed lid and set it to a medium boil. The fish should be 
    ready in about 12 minutes, depending on thickness. At the center of 
    the thickest meat it should be at least 125&deg;F/52&deg;C and 
    there is no need to go over 140&deg;F/60&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Serve hot in the steaming dish with the sauce that has been 
    produced there, or serve on a serving dish, or on individual dishes 
    with sauce ladled over.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for a Pompano, before 
  cleaning and with head on. Use your own best judgement for other 
  fish, and whether they are steamed with head on or off. For a cleaned 
  fish with head off, about 1 pound. Basically, they have to fit in the 
  steamer. Select a fish with little to moderate skin shrinkage for most 
  attractive results. Fillets are also steamed by this method. My 
  favorite is Golden / Florida Pompano, which has no skin shrink at all 
  and a very small head, so it can be used head on or off. I've also 
  cooked many others fish this way. The photo example is a Pink Ear 
  Emperor weighing 1 pound after cleaning and removing head.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Green or Red. The pattern 
  recipe called for 8 Thai chilis. I made it with 7, and it was very 
  spicy, even by Southern California standards. I have reduced it to 4 
  for a general audience, but use your own best judgement, either more 
  or less. If you don't have Thai chilis, fresh de Arbols are a good 
  substitute, or one Serrano chili diced small (they grow Serranos in 
  Thailand now). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro Root:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't get this, and you probably 
  can't, use Cilantro stems - no leaves.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Pork Stock, but 
  Chicken Stock will work fine too.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lime Slices:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the pattern recipe insists 
  on Key Limes for both juice and slices. I doubt most people could tell 
  the difference for the juice, but for the slices they are more elegant.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; A wok with a low steamer grid and a high 
  domed cover is perfect for this (see <a href="smf_fshstm1x.html">
  <b>Photos</b></a>) but other types of steamer will work, so long as 
  they fit the plate that the fish fits on.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>This method of cooking fish is identical to the Chinese, but the 
    flavorings of the sauce are entirely Thai. The fish in the photo 
    example was a Pink Ear Emperor, not because it was ideal, but because 
    I wanted to find if an Emperor worked well for this kind of dish. It 
    worked fine for me, though a little firm. Fish with large heads 
    should always have the head removed.</li>
  <li>The pattern recipe called for 8 Thai Chilis and 8 Garlic cloves. 
    I reduced the chilis as stated above, but also reduced the Garlic. 
    The fish cooks so quickly that the garlic still has a lot of its raw 
    bite, which may be a bit much for many people - use your own best 
    judgement.</li>
  <li>When one side of the fish has been served, just pick up the bones 
    by the tail, they should remove cleanly. The fins are still there, 
    and its best to remove them before starting to serve the bottom half.
    </li>
  <li>I always eat fish with thin chopsticks, which give me the best 
    control, and enable me to find pinbones and the like before the get 
    into my mouth.</li>
    </ul>
