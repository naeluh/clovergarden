<span class=tf>This is my fish steaming rig: a 13 inch Calphalon Wok, 
outfitted with 
<br>a steamer grid and domed lid, both purchased at Asian markets in 
<br>Los Angeles. It can accomodate oval plates up to 11-1/2 inches.</span>

<br class=cll>
<span class=tf>Here is how it will go on the stove - but the plate of 
fish won't go in 
<br>until the steamer rig is fully up to a boil. Strongly preheating the 
<br>steamer mimimizes the amount of condensation that becomes part of 
<br>the sauce.</span>

<br class=cll>
<span class=tf>Something like this can be invaluable for lifting the plate of steamed 
<br>fish out of the steamer (depending on your steamer configuration). 
<br>Of course it doesn't have to be as fancy as this $25 rosewood handled 
<br>Dexter taper bladed hamburger turner.</span>
