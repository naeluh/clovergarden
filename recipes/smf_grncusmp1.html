This is a classic Thai curry. While most often made with chicken, shrimp 
beef and pork are also popular. Because the method varies between 
versions we have prepared separate recipes - see <a href="smf_grncusmp1.html#07">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and de-vein them. If large, cut in half 
    crosswise. </li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise into 6 wedges (if Thai eggplants 
    - see <a href="smf_grncusmp1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for options). Keep eggplants 
    in cold water acidulated with some Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>LIME LEAVES</b> tightly and slice into fine threads. 
    Chop the threads into smaller lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> into thin strips.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and start soaking in cold 
    water (this is so they stay green longer in the curry).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat and stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> until it is well distributed and 
    aromatic, but no browining.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Lime Leaf</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> 
    and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer about 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant</b> and continue to simmer until just tender 
    but not mushy, about 12 minutes for Thai eggplants, a bit less for 
    others. See also <a href="smf_grncusmp1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Shrimp</b> and bring them quickly to a simmer. 
    Don't overcook - just long enough to be pink and opaque.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Red Chili</b> for just a minute, 
    then stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>. Serve immediately with plenty of 
    steamed Jasmine rice or with Asian noodles nested in a bowl.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for headless shrimp in the shell. 
  Medium shrimp (41 to 50 count) work well, though larger can be used. 
  In most of the world people don't bother to remove the "vein" along 
  the top, but it's expected in North America.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; These are green and white and golf ball 
  size. They cook significantly differently from other eggplants and are 
  well worth searching out. If you don't have them use Indian eggplants 
  which are purple and egg size, so cut them into more pieces and cook 
  just a bit less. Lacking even those use Japanese or Italian eggplants 
  split in half lengthwise and cut crosswise about 3/4 inch thick. Cook 
  those even less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I usually use red Fresnos (moderately hot). You 
  could use fresh red Thai chilis (much smaller but much hotter) or 
  Holland Red (moderately hot) - your choice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Green Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essentials of 
  Thai cooking - and the hottest of the Thai curry pastes. It is 
  available commercially (with a lot of variation between brands), 
  but the amount in this recope is scaled for our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_grncurry1.html"><b>Green Curry Paste</b></a>, which 
  is fairly hot.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Pea Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; Thai cooks often toss in a handful of 
  Thai Pea Eggplants along with the green eggplants. Unfortunately these 
  are nearly impossible to get even in Los Angeles.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Because methods differ somewhat, we have 
  prepared separate versions for 
  <a href="smm_grncucow1.html"><b>Beef</b></a>, 
  <a href="smm_grncupig1.html"><b>Pork</b></a>,
  <a href="smc_grncuchk1.html"><b>Chicken</b></a>, and
  <a href="smf_grncufsh1.html"><b>Fish</b></a> Green Curries.</li>
