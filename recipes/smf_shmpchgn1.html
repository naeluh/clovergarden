Chayote leaves are delicious, though a little coarse, and very popular 
throughout Southeast Asia.  This recipe will serve as a main dish for two or 
a side dish for 4, suitable for Asian or Western menus.

I started from a recipe by a lady originally from Penang Island, 
Malaysia. I made changes, and while they are all consistent with 
Southeast Asian practices and similar recipes, I call it 
"Malay / California".

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chayote Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is <u>after stripping</u> from 
  tough stems. As sold here in Los Angeles you'll need a bunch weighing 
  almost twice this weight. I include the tendrils (dragon whiskers), 
  though that makes the texture a bit more coarse. Chayote Greens can be 
  found (irregularly) in large Philippine markets (of which we have many 
  here in Southern California). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sq_chayotz.html#green"><b>Chayote</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red ripe Fresnos, 
  but Holland Red or similar will do fine. Actually, two Fresnos make 
  this just a tad too mild - use your own best judgement. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, 
  use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a 
  good substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sugar</h3> &nbsp;  The touch of sugar is optional, but will 
  counter the slight bitterness of my rather large amount of greens for 
  people sensitive to bitter.</li>
