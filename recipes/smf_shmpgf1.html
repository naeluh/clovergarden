<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after beheading, shelling and de-veining. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/seashrimp.html"><b>Shrimp &amp; 
  Prawns</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; These should be the small dried shrimp 
  available in Asian markets, not the large Mexican or South American 
  kind. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html">
  <b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Curry Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are necessary for the 
  true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably available in 
  Indian and Southeast Asian markets, at least here in California. Dried 
  ones aren't of much use (unless you force dried them yourself within 
  a couple weeks). If you don't have them you will have to leave them out 
  - there is no acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaves</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 4 bird chilis. 
  I prefer 3, but 2 would be safer for most people, and one for the seriously 
  chili adverse. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Chilis - Thai and Southeast Asia</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is a very widely used sauce in 
  East and Southeast Asia. If it is whole bean, crush the beans for this 
  sauce. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html">
  <b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Easily available, usually in chunks, in markets 
  a Southeast Asian community. Coconut Sugar is very similar. If you don't have 
  one of these, use a medium brown sugar. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sweet.html#palm"><b>Sweeteners</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; The Kam Heong sauce is not married to shrimp 
  (prawns). It is a robust sauce that can match with strong flavors and 
  textures. It is also used for small clams, and can be used with a lot of 
  other main ingredients, such as slices of Chicken, Pork, or Beef. 
  Also with robust vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes) and Fried 
  Tofu Puffs.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for the Dried Shrimp 
  to be soaked, drained, then "blitzed" with the oil, and the soaking water 
  added to the sauce to preserve flavor. I found this to be a bit difficult 
  and messy. My method loses no flavor to water. I also cut the total oil 
  back by about 1/3.</li>
