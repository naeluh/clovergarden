  <p>For a faster finish, you could fry the salt fish as part of the 
  prep stage.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>SALTED FISH</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Don't worry if it 
    breaks up. Dry on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b>. Cut in half crosswise if very large.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>SPINACH</b> and cut tendrils into convenient lengths, 
    separating large leaves and tearing really large leaves into two or 
    three pieces. Discard stems 1/4 inch diameter or larger and any that 
    seem fibrous when you break them. Shake off excess water.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> 
    thin, cut into slivers and chop very fine. Mix</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b>, preferably in a wok but a spacious saut&eacute; 
    pan will work. Fry <b>Salted Fish</b> stirring until lightly browned. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Crumble it if it hasn't 
    already broken into small pieces.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Garlic mix</b> stirring until it shows a touch of color, 
    then stir in <b>Shrimp</b> for just a moment.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach</b> until it is coated with oil, then stir in 
    the <b>Sauce mix</b>. Cook stirring frequently just until the spinach 
    is a uniform cooked color (see <a href="smf_shmpms1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>), 
    then stir in <b>Salted Fish</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Salted Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Available, generally in the frozen fish 
  case, at most East and Southeast Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshsaltz.html"><b>Salted Fish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Mong Toi, Saan Choy] &nbsp; 
  It's closer to cactus than to our regular spinach, but has a similar 
  (but much milder) taste. Be careful not to overcook it - it can become 
  slimy. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html">
  <b>Malabar Spinach</b> page</a></li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; As with regular spinach (but more so) be 
  careful not to overcook - it can become slimy and leave an iron 
  aftertaste. When it is a uniform cooked color it is done.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. Sake 
  is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
