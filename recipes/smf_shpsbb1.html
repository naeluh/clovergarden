This is a rich and interesting Thai red curry. Thais love Sour Bamboo 
in soups and curries because of the unique flavor it gives to them.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Make your <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a> 
    if you don't have it on hand.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Shell and devein <b>SHRIMP</b> as needed.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>SOUR BAMBOO</b> and rinse well. Wring out and cut into 
    smallish bite size pieces.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, and start them soaking in 
    cold water. This will help keep them green when added to the curry.
    </li>
  <li>Blast the <b>CHILIS</b> black with your propane torch and brush 
    off the skins under running water (see <a href="smf_shpsbb1.html#09">
    <b>Note-9</b></a>). Seed them and cut into strips about 1/4 inch wide 
    and 1 to 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>LIME LEAVES</b> up (end to end) as tight as you can. Slice 
    these rolls into threads as fine as you can cut them. Discard the 
    central stem and make a few cuts through the threads to shorten 
    them. Mix with <b>Chilis</b>.</li>
  <li>Open 2 ea 14 ounce cans <b>COCONUT MILK</b> <u>without shaking</u>. 
    Scoop about half the contents off the top, including all the cream. 
    Hold separate from the rest of the Coconut Milk.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok, place the <b>Coconut Cream</b> part 
    of the Coconut milk. Bring to a boil (carefully), then stir in 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until evenly distributed. Keep at a strong simmer  
    over moderate heat, stirring constantly until red oil starts to 
    separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sour Bamboo</b>. Then slowly stir in remaining 
    <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    15 minutes. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Palm Sugar</b>, then <b>Chili 
    mix</b>, and simmer another 5 minutes. You can hold it hot for 
    awhile at this point.</li> 
  <li>When ready to serve - bring to a simmer and stir in the 
    <b>Shrimp</b> until pink. take off heat. Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b> 
    and stir in well. Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine 
    rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is headless, shelled and deveined. Size 
  is up to your preference.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sour Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; [Pickled Bamboo Shoots; Naw Mai 
  Dong (Thai)] &nbsp; These are available from many Asian markets, 
  usually from Thailand and in 32 ounce jars. The Bamboo is floating 
  around in a lot of liquid and will be only about 6-7/8 ounces well 
  drained. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html">
  <b>Bamboo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Ripe 
  Fresnos, but other medium hot red chilis, such as Holland Red will 
  work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 3 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Unsweetened</u>. Coconut milk from 
  Thailand is excellent. I use Aroy-D, but there are other fine brands. 
  A good quality Coconut Milk will have lots of heavy cream at the top. 
  Check the recipe - you may need to avoid shaking the can before 
  opening.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Curry Paste, Red:</h3> &nbsp; This is best made at home - see 
  our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. 
  Our recipe is probably a little hotter than most commercial versions, 
  but some of those are so salty you may have to cut back on the Fish 
  Sauce. "Thai Red Curry Sauce" is not Thai and not suitable.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refines sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Skinning the chilis is optional, but I 
  always do it as it improves the texture, and it's particularly 
  important if any of this curry will be reheated. 
  </li>
