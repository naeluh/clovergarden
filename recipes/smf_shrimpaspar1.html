  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min - exclusive of shelling shrimp)
  <ol>
  <li>Shell <b>SHRIMP</b> and de-vein if needed. Cut in half if very 
    large.</li>
  <li>Slice the <b>MUSHROOMS</b> 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick (see 
    <a href="smf_shrimpaspar1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> for details of preparation).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Seed <b>CHILIS</b> and slice into threads or thin rings.</li>
  <li>Break tough ends off <b>ASPARAGUS</b>. Cut spears into thirds, 
    keeping the tip, middle and end pieces separate. If you want to be 
    fancy, cut on a diagonal.</li>
  <li>Bring some water to a boil, toss in the thick ends of the 
    <b>Asparagus</b> and boil for 1-1/2 minutes, then the middle sections 
    for another 1 minute. Finally toss in the tips and continue at a 
    strong simmer until just tender, about 4 more minutes. When tender, 
    pour in enough cold water to stop the cooking but keep the 
    asparagus warm.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Garlic</b> just until aromatic, then stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> 
    and fry stirring about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a boil. Keep at a simmer, 
    stirring now and then, until Mushrooms are cooked, which will 
    depend on type and thickness.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Shrimp</b> and <b>Chilis</b>. Cook stirring until 
    shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Asparagus</b>, stir it in and cook just long enough to 
    heat through. Serve immediately with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; My favorite for this 
  recipe is the small King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms now easily available 
  here in Southern California. Fresh Shiitakes are also good, but after 
  slicing, soak in hot water for 20 minutes, then wring them out. This 
  greatly improves their texture. Dried Black Mushrooms can also be used, 
  but soak them in warm water for about 45 minutes before slicing. You 
  will need 1-1/4 ounces dry to equal 5 ounces of fresh mushrooms. For 
  details, see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Asparagus:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe works best with medium thick 
  asparagus spears. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_aspara.html"><b>Asparagus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red ripe Fresnos, 
  but Holland Red or similar will do fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some people cut the Asparagus diagonally 
  into shorter pieces and stir them into the wok as the final item, stir 
  frying until crisp tender without stock. The method given here makes 
  all the sections cooked perfectly, the shrimp are not over-cooked and 
  there's plenty of sauce to moisten the rice. At least one fancy chef 
  cooks the Asparagus, Shrimp and Mushrooms separately and whole, and 
  makes the sauce (all other ingredients) separately. The main 
  ingredients are arranged on a plate and some sauce spooned over. Too 
  fussy for me.</li>
