This is a popular dish in Southern California's Thai restaurants, and a 
classic "street food" dish in Thailand.  The list of ingredients may seem daunting, but it 
isn't really difficult to make, if you pay attention.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Roast Peanuts (see <a href="smf_thainood1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>)</li>

  <li>Pour hot water over <b>NOODLES</b> (see <a href="smf_thainood1.html#01">Note-1</a>) 
    and soak just until you can wrap a noodle tightly around your finger 
    without it breaking. For this recipe they should be just a touch 
    under-soaked. Drain and cut to about 6 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PALM SUGAR</b> and mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOT</b> fine. Chop <b>PRESERVED RADISH</b> fine. Cut 
    <b>TOFU</b> into 1-1/2 inch long by 1/4 x 1/4 inch sticks.

  <li>For Garnish: coarsely chop <b>ROASTED PEANUTS</b> and <b>CILANTRO 
    LEAVES</b>.</li>
  <li>Set up all ingredients and arrange in the order they will be used. 
    This will go fast, so they need to be organized. Have your table 
    set, including the listed Condiments and extra Garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">

    threatens to color. Stir in the <b>Shrimp</b> and fry stirring 
    until nearly cooked through.</li>
  <li>Push the Shrimp up the side of the wok and pour the <b>Eggs</b> 
    into the middle. Fry stirring, breaking them up as they set. When 
    set, remove all and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 2T <b>Oil</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>. and 
    fry Stirring until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Rice noodles</b> until coated with oil, about 
    30 seconds. Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Shrimp mix</b> for about 1 minute to reheat, or until 
    noodles are tender.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and tumble in <b>Garlic Chives</b>, <b>Bean 
    Sprouts</b>, and <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for dried noodles, and 
  dried are always used in this recipe. The noodles used in the photo 
  example were 0.03 x 0.08 inch (0.75 x 2 mm), about the smallest you'd 
  want to use. The largest you should use are 3mm wide 
  flat noodles. These are #374 and #365 on our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html#374"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Available from markets serving a South or 
  Southeast Asian community. If you don't have it, use a partially 
  refined cane sugar, such as Turbanado.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind Pulp</h3> &nbsp; This can be prepared concentrate or 
  freshly made from block (better). For details and method see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Preserved Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Usually labeled 
  "Preserved Turnip", this is salt pickled daikon radish. It is all 
  shriveled up but still quite crisp. It is especially included for 
  its crunchy texture. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_daiprez.html"><b>Preserved Turnip / Daikon 
  Radish</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tofu - Extra Firm:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't find this you can 
  press a block of Firm Tofu for an hour or so. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#reg"><b>Tofu / Bean Curd</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for tiny Asian dried shrimp 
  before grinding. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html"><b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Garlic Chives:</h3> &nbsp; [Chinese Chives] &nbsp; If you don't 
  have these, use regular chives or sliver the green part of about 3 
  medium Scallions. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_chive.html"><b>Chives</b></a> page.</li>
 <li id="09">
  <h3>Peanuts:</h3> These are best raw and roasted at home, the taste 
  and texture is quite different from commercial. For method see our 
  recipe   <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous Huy Fong Chili Garlic 
  Sauce will be fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is rarely made in Thai homes, 
  since expert street vendors are close by - but we don't have those 
  in California. While very popular in Thailand, food historians say 
  this is not a traditional dish, but was invented in the 1930s or 
  1940s as part of a national identity program. That the name simply 
  means "Thai Stir Fry" is a hint. Pad Thai is not always made with 
  shrimp. Deep fried Tofu, or other Tofu forms can be used for a 
  vegetarian version. Pork and Beef are also used. For other meats, 
  slice very thin and add same as the Shrimp, but frying time may be 
  a bit longer. I eat this dish with Cilantro and lots of Chili Garlic 
  sauce.</li>
