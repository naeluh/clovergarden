In China, fried rice is thought too strongly flavored to serve with meals, 
but Laotian food is more robust. Laotian Fried Rice can be a full dinner 
dish, including a lot more vegetables and meats than in China.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>

    <li>Make <b>RICE</b> well ahead so it is completely cold (see 
    <a href="smg_ricefry1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <br>Measures for Vegies are after cutting to size.
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and cut into strips 1 to 1-1/2 inches long.
     </li> 
  <li>Cap and core <b>CHILIS</b>. Chop fine and mix with <b>Pork</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>EGGPLANT</b> about 1/2 inch.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BABY CORN</b> in half lengthwise and into 1/2 inch 
    lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick and into about 
    1/2 inch pieces.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BEANS</b> into 1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>RED ONION</b> about 1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Vegies Items</b></li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b></li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>MINT</b> or <b>BASIL</b> leaves for Garnish. Soak in 
    cold water so they don't turn black so fast when applied.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="14">
  <li>Fluff the <b>Rice</b> as best you can, breaking up lumps.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 1/4 Cup <b>Oil</b> 
    (not less) over moderately high heat. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> and 
    fry stirring until it is starting to turn golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork mix</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vegies mix</b>. Fry stirring often until they are 
    crisp tender, about 7 minutes. You can cover between stirrings.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Rice</b> until well distributed and lumps are 
    broken up, then stir in the <b>Sauce mix</b>. Fry stirring until 
    everything is well heated, about 3 minutes over fairly high heat. 
    Scrape up the rice so it doesn't stick to the pan.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and take off the heat. Serve hot 
    garnished with <b>Mint</b> or <b>Basil</b> (see 
    <a href="smg_ricefry1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Use long grain rice like thai Jasmine, which 
  should be well washed, then cooked fairly dry so when the grains are 
  cooked through they are still quite separate. You will need 1 cup raw 
  to produce 2-1/2 cups (15 ounces) cooked. The rice must be fully cold, 
  preferably refrigerated overnight, which changes the starch composition. 
  Pack it loosely and make sure nothing sits on top of it.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Ripe 
  Fresnos, but other medium hot red chilis, such as Holland Red will 
  work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant</h3> &nbsp; If I don't have them, I use small egg 
  shaped Indian eggplants, which are more available locally. They cook 
  softer, but that's not a  problem. You could also use some other 
  vegetable, like 4 ounces of Zucchini, or another vegetable that 
  will be fairly soft.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Baby Corn:</h3> &nbsp; Easily available canned, but fresh, canned 
  or Frozen corn kernels can be substituted.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Oyster Mushrooms are preferred, particularly 
  the small King Trumpet oyster mushrooms now so common here in 
  California, but white mushrooms can be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Long Beans</h3> &nbsp; These are preferred, but String Beans, 
  Snap Peas or Snow Peas can be substituted. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media in Southeast 
  Asia is Lard, and, if you use it, you will have a lot <u>less trouble 
  with rice sticking</u> to the pan. Lard has a health profile better 
  than butter, and is far and away better for you than the trans fats 
  and denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has told you to use. Do render your 
  own lard though, it's easy. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="08">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; In Laos, one way this is served is to lightly 
  oil a deep bowl, individual serving size. Put 
  some small tomato dice in the bottom, then lightly pack the finished 
  fried rice over it up to the rim. A serving plate is then placed over 
  the bowl. Invert to unmold the rice mound. Serving in a communal 
  bowl is another other option.</li>
