  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (37 min - exclusive of peeling shrimp)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>MALABAR SPINACH</b>. Discard stems over 1/4 inch diameter 
    and excessively damaged leaves. Cut remaining stems diagonally about 
    1 inch long. Cut leaves into strips about 1 x 1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into pieces about 
    1 inch on a side, or whatever works with your pork.</li>
  <li>Shell and de-vein <b>SHRIMP</b> if not already done. If large, 
    cut in half.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut as needed to 
    roughly match the size of the Pork.</li>
  </ol>
   <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over high 
    heat. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until Onion is 
    translucent, then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Continue to fry stirring 
    for another 3 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
    Cover and keep at a simmer until Pork is tender, about 20 minutes.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b>  and <b>Mushrooms</b>. 
    Continue to cook another 5 minutes stirring now and then.
  <li>Stir in <b>Shrimp</b> and cook stirring now and then until the 
    Shrimp have turned color. Adjust liquid if needed, this recipe 
    should finish with some free liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Malabar Spinach</b>, bring back to a boil. Cook,  
    tumbling often, until wilted and of uniform color, about 3 minutes. 
    <u>Do not overcook</u>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Alugbati (Philippine), Mong Toi 
  (Viet)] &nbsp; This leafy, almost succulent green is available in 
  Asian markets, often labeled "Mong Toi". Keep in mind it is easily 
  damaged and doesn't store well. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for head-off small or medium shrimp.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The best mushrooms for this dish are the 
  relatively firm Oyster Mushrooms or small King Trumpet Mushrooms that 
  have become widely available. White mushrooms can be used if 
  necessary. For details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html">
  <b>Oyster Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Ginisang is a Philippine word for a stir 
  fried dish. The pattern recipe did not call for peeling the tomatoes, 
  but I prefer to avoid bits of tomato skin floating around in my 
  recipes. It takes almost no additional time.</li>
