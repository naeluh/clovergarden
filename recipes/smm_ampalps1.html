Bitter Gourd (Ampalaya) is popular in the Philippines, as it is in most 
of South and Southeast Asia. Bitter tastes take a bit 
of time and exposure to really like, but it's worth the bother.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (37 min - exclusive of peeling shrimp)
  <ol>
  <li>Split <b>BITTER MELONS</b> lengthwise in half and scoop out the 
    seed mass. Slice crosswise about 1/8 inch thick. In a bowl, mix well 
    with salt and let sit, tumbling now and then, for at least 30 minutes, 
    or until needed for the recipe. Rinse and drain.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into pieces about 
   1 inch on a side, or whatever works with your pork.</li>
  <li>Shell and de-vein <b>SHRIMP</b> if not already done.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> lightly.</li>
  </ol>
   <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over high 
    heat. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until Onion is 
    translucent, then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Continue to fry stirring 
    until Tomato is well softened and nearly all liquid has evaporated.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Alamang</b> and <b>Pepper</b>, then <b>Water</b>. Bring 
    to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and keep at a fast simmer 
    until Pork is tender, about 25 minutes. Adjust liquid if needed, 
    this recipe should finish with some free liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bitter Melon</b> and <b>Shrimp</b>. Simmer for about 
    4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Push everything to one side. Pour <b>Eggs</b> into the empty 
    space (there will be liquid) and let stand until they are setting 
    well. Break them up into  medium shards while you mix them with the 
    other ingredients.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Bitter Gourd, Ampalaya (Philippine)] 
  &nbsp; These are available in most markets serving a Southeast Asian 
  or Chinese community. You want the smooth lumpy Chinese variety, not 
  the more bitter pointy lumpy India variety. Choose small, dark green 
  gourds. Gourds with a yellow cast will be less flavorful and more 
  bitter. For details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html">
  <b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for head-off  medium shrimp.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Alamang:</h3> &nbsp; [Bagoong Alamang] &nbsp; This is Philippine 
  salted shrimp paste. Try to get one that is not dyed fluorescent 
  lipstick pink. Filipinos like that color, but it is very unappetizing 
  to me. I use Tropics brand which is not as intensely over-dyed as some. 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html">
  <b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did not call for peeling 
  the tomatoes, but I prefer to avoid bits of tomato skin floating around 
  in my recipes. It takes almost no additional time.</li>
