This rich and flavorful recipe is in the style of Bicol, the far 
southeast point of the northern island of Luzon, but is said to originate 
from Manilla (see <a href="smm_bicolexp1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; This is uncured bacon, a cut very much 
  favored in China and the Philippines. It can be found in markets 
  serving Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Latino communities. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html">
  <b>Pork Belly</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Properly, Bicol Express should be made 
  <u>pretty hot</u> using <i>Siling Mahaba</i> chilis, which are 
  medium hot (about as hot as a jalapeno, but different flavor). Siling 
  Mahaba are not currently much available in North America. The photo 
  example was made with 5 Serranos, but those vary so much these days I 
  recommend starting with three and adjusting up as needed. Sometimes 
  three is enough, sometimes you need eight. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html">Sili - Philippine Chilis</a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good quality rather 
  thick coconut milk with plenty of cream. I use Aroy D brand from 
  Thailand, one of the best.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bagoong:</h3> &nbsp; This is fermented shrimp paste. Some recipes 
  call for saut&eacute;d paste and some for regular, but all avoid those 
  dyed a horrid pink color. The saut&eacute;d was used for the photo 
  sample. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html">
  <b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Bicol, coconuts and chilis are used much 
  more than in the rest of Luzon, indicating development in Bicol, or 
  perhaps popularized in Manilla by people from Bicol. The dish is 
  apparently named for a train that runs from Manilla to Bicol.</li>
