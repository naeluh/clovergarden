Beef adobo is made less often than chicken and pork adobo due to its 
expense, but it's a worthy dish. This economical recipe is adapted from 
our all meat version - <a href="smm_cowadobo1.html">Beef Adobo</a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim all fat, membranes, etc. from the <b>BEEF</b> (weight given is 
    after trimming). Put all trimmings in a saucepan, bring to a boil for 
    2 minutes. Rinse and clean the pan. Put the beef back in with water just 
    to cover and set to simmering to make stock. Do this as far ahead as 
    practical. Strain, then defat the stock using your gravy separator.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beef</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inches on a side or as 
    desired.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin 
    and slice into threads. Stem <b>CHILIS</b> and split open. 
    Combine <b>All Sauce items</b>. in a non-reactive bowl, then stir in 
    <b>Beef</b>. Marinate overnight in the fridge or 4 hours at a cool 
    room temperature, tumbling now and then.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes about 3/4 to 1 inch on a side. 
    Put in a saucepan with water to cover and simmer until just done, about 
    20 minutes (see <a href="smm_cowadobo2.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 to 2 hrs depending)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Beef</b> well, retaining all the marinade.</li>
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Beef</b>, tumbling often until it is lightly browned all over.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Marinade</b> and 1/3 cup <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    cover tightly and simmer until beef is tender, 3/4 to 1 hour depending 
    on cut.</li>
  <li>When Beef is tender, add <b>Potatoes</b> and enough stock to make 
    a proper stew. Simmer until potatoes are heated through.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for lean beef with any bones or excess 
  fat removed. I prefer chuck (shoulder) but round or any other of the 
  more flavorful cuts will work. Cooking time will be affected depending 
  on cut, and prep time depending on how much trimming you have to do. 
  It's best to have plenty of trimmings for the stock.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The proper chili would be Siling-Labuyo, a very 
  small very hot Philippine chili. Unfortunately these have become scarce 
  even in the Philippines. Growers have switched to larger, easier to 
  harvest chilis similar to the Thai chilis we have here. These are 
  sometimes of disappointing heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use a high quality Philippine cane, 
  palm or coconut vinegar. Lacking those, rice or cider vinegar can be 
  used. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
  <b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Use White Rose or similar potatoes. Avoid 
  Yukon Gold type potatoes which turn to mush if cooked just a little 
  long. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Do not add raw potatoes to the stew and expect 
  them to cook there. The acid in the vinegar will harden the outside of 
  the raw cubes giving them an unpleasing texture. Service is also much 
  more flexible if they are cooked separately.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; You could argue that potatoes aren't native to 
  the Philippines, but nor are beef, chilis or sugar cane for the vinegar. 
  If you really want to, you can use taro instead of Potatoes, though  
  it is thought to have come from Malaysia, just a lot longer ago.</li>
