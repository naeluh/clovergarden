A light beefy dish, simple to make, with interesting textural contrasts. 
The basil leaves won't be so green, but otherwise this dish reheats very 
well. Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into strips abotu 1/8 inch thick, about 2 
    inches long and less than 1/2 inch wide. Massage with <b>Cornstarch</b> 
    and <b>Water</b> until evenly coated. Let sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILIS</b> very small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> into slices similar in size to the Beef. If 
    they were canned, blanch in boiling water for 5 minutes to remove the 
    tinniness (not needed for the more modern vacuum pack) Weight given is 
    drained.</li> 
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into slivers.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and set them to soaking in 
    cold water (keeps them green longer).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Chili mix</b> until aromatic, then stir in 
    <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until it completely looses its raw 
    color and any exuded liquid has evaporated. Tke care the fond that 
    sticks to the pan doesn't get too dark.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Oyster Sauce</b> and fry stirring 
    for about 1 minute. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Bamboo Shoots</b> and fry stirring for another 3 minutes 
    or so until Beef is cooked through and bamboo shoots are hot.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Bell Peppers</b> for about 1 minute. Take off heat and 
     stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have these, one medium 
  Serrano will do the job. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely available in 
  plastic vacuum bags, and are much better than canned - no tinny taste.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Basil:</h3> &nbsp; This should be the Thai Purple Basil, not 
  the yellow-green Lemon Basil often sold as "Thai Basil". The best 
  substitute would be Italian Basil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mt_basiltz.html"><b>Thai Purple Basil</b></a> page.
  </li>
  <li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
