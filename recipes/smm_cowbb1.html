This recipe provides plenty for those who favor beef, and its chewy 
texture is balanced by the crunchiness of bamboo shoots. A little chili 
heat adds interest and balance. See also <a href="smm_cowbb1.html#06">

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  trimmed away. Use a reasonably tender cut such as shoulder as cooking 
  time is short.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; Thai recipes of this sort call for 
  coarsely ground, but a medium fine grind will still work. The most 
  important thing is that it be freshly ground.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but a hassle and not 
  always available. Best to buy in vacuum pack bags (unless your market 
  has them in a bulk tub). Canned is available everywhere, but needs to 
  be par boiled for 5 minutes or more to remove the metallic taste.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Fresh Red:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Ripe 
  Fresnos, but other medium hot red chilis, such as Holland Red will 
  work. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Do-Ahead</h3> &nbsp; This recipe can be made right up to serving, 
  then held if needed, with a final frying to reheat just before 
  garnishing and serving.</li>
