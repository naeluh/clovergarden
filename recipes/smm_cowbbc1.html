A very typical Thai Beef Red Curry. It is simple, satiisfying, and not 
difficult to make. It can be varied to taste, see <a href="smm_cowbbc1.html#08">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>Beef</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut slices into 
    bite size strips about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut to a 
    size similar to the Beef.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, and start them soaking in 
    cold water. This will help keep them green when added to the curry.
    </li>
  <li>Roll <b>LIME LEAVES</b> up (end to end) as tight as you can. Slice 
    these rolls into threads as fine as you can cut them. Discard the 
    central stem and make a few cuts through the threads to shorten 
    them. Mix with <b>Chilis</b>.</li>
  <li>Open <b>COCONUT MILK</b> <u>without shaking</u>. Scoop about 6 
    ounces off the top, including all the cream. Hold separate from 
    the rest of the Coconut Milk.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or wok, place the <b>Coconut Cream</b> part 
    of the Coconut milk. Bring to a boil (carefully), then stir in 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until evenly distributed. Keep at a strong simmer  
    over moderate heat, stirring continuously and scraping the pan until 
    oil starts to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b>. Cook over moderate heat, stirring often 
    for about 5 minutes until you again see red oil starting to separate.
    </li>
  <li>Slowly stir in remaining <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Water</b>. 
    Bring to a boil, then stir in <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Bring back to 
    a boil and stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Palm Sugar</b> and 
    <b>Lime Leaves</b>. Simmer for another 15 minutes or until 
    Beef is tender, covered or uncovered as needed to get the sauce 
    right. It should be quite liquid, but not overwhelming. This recipe 
    can be held warm for a while at this point if needed.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve - bring to a simmer. Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b> 
    and stir in well. Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine 
    rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless with any excess fat removed. 
  Cooking is short, so use a reasonably tender cut such shoulder rather 
  than round.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh is best, but a hassle and not 
  always available. Best to buy in vacuum pack bags (unless your market 
  has them in a bulk tub). Canned is available everywhere, but needs to 
  be par boiled for 5 minutes or more to remove the metallic taste.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Unsweetened</u> Coconut milk from 
  Thailand is excellent. I use Aroy-D, but there are other fine brands. 
  A good quality Coconut Milk will have lots of heavy cream at the top. 
  Check the recipe - you may need to avoid shaking the can before 
  opening.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Curry Paste, Red:</h3> &nbsp; You can buy commercially made Thai 
  Red Curry Paste, but it's better made at home. Our recipe for 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a> is probably 
  a little hotter than most commercial versions, but some of those are 
  so salty you may have to cut back on the Fish Sauce. <u>Caution</u>: 
  do not attempt to use "Thai Red Curry Sauce" products - they will not 
  work the same way. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_thairz.html"><b>Thai Red Curry Paste &amp; 
  Sauces</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in 
  pretty much all Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps 
  of about 1 Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly 
  refines sugar such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Hotness will depend on what red curry 
  paste is used and how much. 2 T made by our recipe makes this dish 
  "satisfying hot" by Southern California standards (but rather mild by 
  Thai standards). Use your own best judgement. One writer, remembering 
  the Beef Red Curry served in her boarding school when she was a child, 
  used ground beef, as they would in such an institution, and left out 
  the Kaffir Lime and Basil.</li>
