A fine beefy stir fry for we who like Bitter Melon, but perhaps not for 
so-called "super tasters" who can't stand bitter. Bitter Melon is very 
popular through Southeast Asia, Southern China, and India.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into strips about 1/8 inch thick, 
    1/2 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches long. This is easier if you chill the 
    beef in the freezer for about 30 minutes to stiffen. It must be thin, 
    because cooking time is very short.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Marinade Items</b> and massage into the <b>Beef</b>. Set 
    aside and marinate for about 30 minutes turning once or twice.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BITTER MELON</b> in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seed 
    mass with a spoon. Slice Diagonally about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> hot over 
    high flame. Stir in the <b>Garlic</b> for a few seconds until aromatic, 
    then stir in <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until all raw color is gone, 
    being careful not to burn the fond that sticks to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1 T <b>Oyster Sauce</b> to coat the Beef, Then stir in the 
    <b>Water</b> and the 2 T <b>Oyster Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bitter Melon</b>, <b>Salt</b>, and <b>Pepper</b>, bring 
    back to a boil, then simmer covered until Bitter Melon is crisp tender, 
    about 5 minutes. Stir up fond stuck to the pan, it's part of the sauce.
    </li>  
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat and 
  membranes removed. Chuck or brisket work fine, but cooking time is very 
  short, so avoid tough cuts like Round.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; Use the Chinese variety, the one with 
  a smooth warty skin. Select the darkest green ones you can find. Two 
  smaller ones is better than one big one. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html"><b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
