A very popular dish in California. The recipe will serve two as a single 
main dish or four in Asian style with other dishes. Working with the 
noodles is a bit tricky, so read the notes.  See 
<a href="smm_cowbrocnood2.html"><b>Recipe #2</b></a> for street 
vendor style.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These should be 3/4 
  inch or wider. Unfortunately noodles that wide are hard to find either 
  fresh or dried. I usually cut them 1 inch wide from fresh Rice Roll 
  (sheets of rice noodle). These vary in thickness, thicker ones work 
  better. If dried (Rice Flakes are a good size) soak in 
  cool water 1 to 1-1/2 hours depending on thickness. 5-1/2 ounces will 
  make 10 ounces soaked. If you are unpracticed you may find the dried 
  more forgiving and easier to handle. Using fresh noodles, I cut the 
  block into 2 inch widths, then rub the sheets loose one by one and cut 
  them to width. Spread them out and keep them fluffed up so they don't 
  all stick together. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chinese Broccoli:</h3> &nbsp; Gai-lan is similar to 
  Italian rapini but with larger leaves. If all you have is regular 
  broccoli   cut into small florets and discard tough main stem but 
  keep all the smaller stems. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_brocccz.html"><b>Gai Lan</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp;  Optional, and I seldom use it - but it does 
  cover the slight bitterness of broccoli if that would bother you.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for "Dark Soy Sauce" but 
  I prefer the lighter flavor and appearance of regular soy sauce.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is available in 
  markets serving a Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> 
  page. You want the ugly dark one.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Condiments:</h3> &nbsp; Two of the essential Thai table condiments 
  (the third is dry chili flake). We have a recipe for 
  <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html">Chili Vinegar Sauce</a>. For the 
  Chili Garlic Sauce the ubiquitous Huy Fong brand will do fine. It's not 
  totally authentic (they don't have red ripe jalapeno chilies in 
  Thailand - yet) but no-one seems to mind the extra flavor. For details 
  see <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a>
