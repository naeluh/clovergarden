This is a popular Thai country curry. Though more often made with pork, 
beef is also used. Because they are handled a bit differently, we have 
a separate recipe for <a href="smm_pigcryr1.html">
<b>Pork Red Curry</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> about 1/8 inch across the grain, and cut into 
    strips about 1-1/2 by 3/4 inches, or whatever works with the beef 
    you have. Unfortunately bovines are not rectangular.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Beef</b> in a pan with <b>Water</b> to cover well. Bring 
    to a boil for 1 minute, then strain out and rinse Beef (this is to 
    keep the curry liquid clear).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise into 6 wedges (if Thai eggplants 
    - see <a href="smm_cowcryr1.html#02">Note-2</a> for others). Keep eggplants in cold 
    water acidulated with some Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until needed.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 1 to 1-1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> thin and cut into pieces about 1 inch 
    long by about 1/2 inch wide.</li> 
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b>. Cut in half lengthwise, remove seeds and cut 
    crosswise into strips about 1/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and start soaking in cold 
    water (this is so they stay green longer in the curry).</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Broth items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat and stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> until it is well distributed and 
    aromatic, but no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring for a few minutes until 
    it is hot and well coated with the curry paste.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth mix</b> and <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    then cover and simmer until Beef is tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant</b> and <b>Long Beans</b>. Bring back to a 
    boil and continue to simmer until just tender but not mushy, about 
    12 minutes for Thai eggplants, somewhat less for others.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b>. If you wish, separate some out to use 
    as Garnish. Cut the rest into wide shreds</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Red Chili</b> for just a minute, 
    then turn off heat and stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. In Thailand 
    they probably spoon it over the rice, but I serve it beside the rice 
    in a deep plate, with a good amount of the broth, to be mixed as 
    desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat removed. A flavorful but not too tough cut such as shoulder 
  is best, but since it is sliced thin, round can be used with a little 
  longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; These are green and white and golf 
  ball size. They cook significantly differently from other eggplants 
  and are well worth searching out. If you don't have them, use 
  Indian eggplants which are purple and egg size, so cut them into 
  quarters lengthwise, cut the wedges in half crosswise (8 pieces), and 
  cook just a bit less. Lacking even those, use Japanese or Italian 
  eggplants split in quarters lengthwise and cut crosswise about 3/4 
  inch thick. Cook those even less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These have an afinity for beef, and are 
  now widely grown in California, available in most markets serving a 
  Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page. Regular 
  green beans have a much different flavor, but can be used, but give 
  them less cooking time.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably buy these in vacuum pack 
  bags. This avoids the par boiling step recommended to remove the tinny 
  flavor of canned Bamboo Shoots.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Prik Chee Fah, 
  but they aren't much available in North America. Around here everyone 
  uses red ripe Fresno chilis, but Holland Red would also work. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis 
  Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; In Asian cooking there is no requirement for 
  the stock to match the meat, so beef, pork or chicken stock can be 
  used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essentials of Thai 
  cooking, and is available commercially (with a lot 
  of variation between brands). It is better made at home. The amount 
  in this recipe is scaled for our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>, recipe, which is fairly hot. 2 T is about 
  the minimum to make this curry "satisfyingly hot" by Southern 
  California standards, but it would be woefully mild by Thai standards. 
  Use your own best judgement, but only wimps from the Frozen North 
  would go as low as 1 T. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: "Red Curry Sauce" sold by 
  yuppie food outlets is unsuitable for real Thai recipes.</li>
