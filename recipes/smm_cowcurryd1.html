An intensely flavored dry curry that makes a good side or Asian dish. I 
consider it too intense (though not chili hot) to be the only main dish 
and too dry to stand alone with rice.See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> of any excess fat and cut into 1 inch cubes.</li>  
  <li>Dry fry <b>SHREADED COCONUT</b> until golden for paste.</li>
  <li>Smash bottom 6 inches of the <b>LEMON GRASS</b> with the flat 
    side of your kitchen mallet. Slice the bottom 4 inches crosswise as 
    thin as you can. Tie a knot in the remaining top part and set it 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> as thin as you can, then pound with your 
    food mallet. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop all <b>Paste items</b> fine, then run in a mini-prep food 
    processor, adding in order listed (hardest and dryest first. Finish 
    by pounding in a big Thai stone mortar.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hour)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a coverable wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Beef</b> stirring until all exuded liquid has evaporated 
    and it is lightly browned.  Remove from the oil and set aside.</li>
  <li>In the same oil (add a little if needed) fry the <b>Paste</b> for 
    about 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b>, then 
    <b>Salem Leaves</b>, <b>Lemongrass top</b>, <b>Beef</b> and 
    <b>Stock</b>. Bring  to a boil and simmer covered for 1-1/2 hours 
    or until beef is tender. Watch that it doesn't get too dry but 
    there should be very little liquid when it's done.</li>
  <li>Serve accompanied by steamed Jasmine rice and other dishes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Chuck roast is good for this. Round will work 
  but will increase cooking time significantly.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Galangal</h3> &nbsp; This board hard relative of ginger imparts 
  a unique flavor to Southeast Asian soups and stews. Fresh is best but 
  frozen is fine. Dried and powdered is not acceptable. If you don't 
  have it, use fresh Ginger Root - not at all the same, but acceptable. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html">
  <b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North America in markets that serve an East or Southeast 
  Asian community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html">
  <b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>   
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh red Fresno or Holland Red chilis are 
  fine. The Holland Red are more authentic but generally unavailable, 
  and they're getting ground up anyway, so no-one will know. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Salam Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; (Daun Salam) These can be had dried and 
  are unique to Indonesian and Malaysian cooking. The nearest substitute 
  is <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html">Curry Leaf</a>, but it's not 
  real close. For details see our <a href="../ingred/my_dsalamz.html">
  <b>Daun Salam</b></a> page.</li>
