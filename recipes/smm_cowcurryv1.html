Substantial, satisfying and intensely flavored. Many Vietnamese curries 
are served with noodles, but this one is better with rice. Both Chinese 
and Indian influences are evident, expressed in a Vietnamese way.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Dice <b>BEEF</b> into about 1/2 in cubes.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Remove seeds from the 
    <b>CHILIS</b>, cut into threads and chop fine. Strip tough outer 
    leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard root end. 
    Smash thoroughly with your kitchen mallet and slice the bottom 4 
    inches crosswise as thin as you can (see <a href="smm_cowcurryv1.html#05">
    <b>Note-6</b></a>). Mix together <b>All Marinade Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Marinade</b> into <b>Beef</b> and set aside for at least 
    an hour for flavors to blend (overnight if in the fridge). Massage 
    again a couple times during the marinating.</li>  
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 inch dice. Cut <b>CARROTS</b> 
    into similarly sized dice, Mix and keep in cold water until n
    eeded.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (45 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Optional: in a small sauce pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Annatto 
    Seeds</b> over moderate heat until the oil is nice and orange - 
    don't overheat. Strain  out the seeds.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan and stir in 
    <b>Beef</b> and <b>Marinade</b>. Fry stirring over moderately high 
    heat until oil starts to separate (about 7 minutes) - avoid 
    browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potato mix</b> and fry stirring until evenly mixxed with 
    beef.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    cook over low flame until potatoes are tender (about 20 minutes). 
    The sauce needs to thicken a bit but should remain quite liquid, 
    so cook uncovered until the right consistency, then cover.</li>
  <li>Check salt. Serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good stewing cut such as chuck 
  (shoulder). Weight is with all excess fat, bones and membranes removed.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos but Holland 
  Red are closer to native chilis. You can control heat by scraping 
  out membranes or leaving them in. For this recipe I remove the seed 
  mass, but leave the membranes in. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Five Spice Powder:</h3> &nbsp; A basic Chinese spice mix. Vietnam 
  is more influenced by China than the rest of Southeast Asia. You can 
  easily make it from our recipe <a href="cys_fivespc1.html">
  <b>Five Spice Powder</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer White Rose potatoes which achieve 
  the right consistency and hold together well. Do not use Yukon Gold - 
  they turn to mush if cooked just a little long.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Annatto:</h3> &nbsp; This is a fix. This recipe should be made red 
  by tiny tree seeds called <i>hot mau</i> added to the five spice 
  powder. I have not yet identified these botanically and they are said 
  not to be available outside Vietnam. So we dye the oil with the ever 
  popular annatto seeds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_annattz.html"><b>Annatto / Achiote</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Marinade:</h3> &nbsp; OK, I like my marinade as smooth as I can 
  get it, so I pound my lemon grass, slice it as thin as I can and then 
  run it in my mini-prep food processor until running it longer will be 
  futile. Then I pound it well in my big Thai granite mortar. So as 
  long as I've got that monster out, I also pound the garlic and chilis.
