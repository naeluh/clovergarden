Long cooking, but durable, this dish can be made days ahead and improves 
with reheating, or it can be served cool as an appetizer. In Indonesia it 
is often made in greater quantity and served over several days.

<p>You can also stop cooking while there is still quite a bit of sauce 
for a different effect. &nbsp; Yield: 1-1/2 pounds of raw beef = 1 pound 
finished.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into about 1 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li> 
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop small. Crush <b>Candlenuts</b> in a mortar. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Grind together all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>Kaffir Leaves</b> tightly and then slice into threads. Chop 
    up the threads so they are very short.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a skillet heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b>, stirring until 
    very light golden, then stir in <b>Ginger mix</b> and fry stirring 
    until garlic starts to brown.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spice Mix</b>. Fry stirring another minute, then cool and 
    reduce to a paste (see <a href="smm_cowdrycry1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).
    </li>
  <li>In a heavy bottomed stew pot, stir in the <b>Paste</b>, <b>Coconut 
    Milk</b>, <b>Kaffir Leaf</b> and <b>Salam Leaf</b>.  Bring slowly to a 
    boil stirring constantly.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b>. Bring back to a boil stirring 
    constantly. Now turn the heat <u>very low</u> and simmer slowly, 
    uncovered, stirring often, until the meat is tender. This is going 
    to be about 2-1/2 hours for chuck, up to 3-1/2 for round. If it looks 
    like it'll dry out before the beef is tender, add a little water and 
    simmer it covered for awhile. When it is done the meat will be a dark 
    brown and coated with the dried sauce. There will be no liquid at all.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot, or let cool, as you wish. This dish can be refrigerated 
    for days and reheated, or just allowed to come back to room temperature. 
  </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Cheap and tough works fine here, but round takes 
  longer to cook than chuck.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Candlenuts:</h3> &nbsp; If not available, use 4 raw Macadamias or 
  raw Cashews, or lacking those, 6 raw blanched almonds.  For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sr_candlez.html"><b>Candlenut</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Adjust to your preference. I use two dried red 
  Thai chilis. Use Arbols for medium heat and for even less heat use the 
  common Japones. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1 stem. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Salam Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; (Daun Salam) These can be 
  had dried and are unique to Indonesian and Malaysian cooking. The nearest 
  substitute is <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html"><b>Curry Leaf</b></a>, 
  but it's not real close. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/my_dsalamz.html"><b>Daun Salam</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Paste:</h3> &nbsp;  Traditionally this is done in a big stone 
  <a href="../ke/mortar.html"><b>Mortar</b></a>. You could also use a 
  mini-prep food processor by adding a little of the coconut 
  milk, since it goes in next anyway.</li>
