<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; 12 ounces is about 2 cups loosely packed. 1 cup 
  raw rice makes about 17 ounces cooked. This should be long grain 
  rice, completely cold, preferably made a day or two ahead and 
  refrigerated. This changes its starch composition for easier frying. 
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil / Lard:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional frying media in Thailand 
  is Lard, and, if you use it, you will have a lot <u>less trouble with 
  rice sticking</u> to the pan. Lard has a health profile better than 
  butter, and is far and away better for you than the trans fats and 
  denatured omega-6 oils the AHA has told you to use. Do render your 
  own lard though, it's easy. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cucumber</h3> &nbsp; This should be Persian, Japanese, or some 
  other narrow variety that need not be peeled or seeded.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Vinegar Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essential 
  Thai table condiments. With this you can make the recipe mild, but 
  still satisfy those who like Thai chili heat. See our recipe
