  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hours &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF SHANKS</b> of any excess fat. Place in a Pot and 
    and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. Pour into a clean skink to drain. 
    Rinse off crud and return to the cleaned pot with water to cover. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 hours or until meat is tender. 
    Reserving the broth, strain out the meat, de-bone it and cut into 
    chunks about 1 inch on a side. De-fat the broth using your gravy 
    separator. This can all be done a day or more ahead. You will need 
    3 cups of broth for this recipe.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BOK CHOY</b> into lengths. Start at 1/2 inch at the big 
    stem end, increasing to 2 inches at the leaf end. Cut 
    <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 2 inch lengths. Mix.</li>
  <li>If using Philippine or Chinese <b>EGGPLANTS</b>, quarter lengthwise 
    and into 1-1/2 inch lengths. Cut others to come out to a similar 
    size. Immediately immerse in water acidulated with citric acid or 
    lemon juice to prevent browning.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. Cut <b>LIME WEDGES</b> as needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a 5 quart pot, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b>, 
    stirring until onions are translucent and garlic shows a touch 
    of golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b> and 3 cups <b>Broth</b>. Bring to a boil and 
    simmer 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, breaking up all lumps. Bring back to a 
    boil and simmer covered another 5 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Drain <b>Eggplant</b> and stir in along with <b>Bok Choy mix</b>. 
    Bring back to a boil and simmer 10 minutes or until vegetables are 
    tender. This recipe finishes a little light on salt, because very 
    salty Bagoong will be added.</li>
  <li>Stir  in <b>Lime Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with <b>Bagoong</b> and <b>Lime Wedges</b> on the side 
    (if a sitdown dinner), or stir in <b>Bagoong</b> and serve 
    <b>Lime Wedges</b> on the side (if buffet service) - see 
    <a href="smm_cowkare1.html#10"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Shanks:</h3> &nbsp; I use meaty center cut beef shanks, 
  bone in. Of course you could also use Ox Tail as many recipes call for, 
  but it'll cost ya! See also <a href="smm_cowkare1.html#11"><b>Comments</b></a></li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely 
  available in North America, and any market serving a Southeast 
  Asian community should have them. Green Beans are an imperfect 
  substitute because their flavor is different and they don't stand 
  up to cooking as well. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bok Choy or:</h3> &nbsp; This is one place where recipes differ. 
  Bok Choy, Kangkong (Ong Choy, Water Spinach), Napa Cabbage, regular 
  Cabbage, Banana Blossom and Daikon Radish all appear in recipes in 
  any combination. Spinach, called for by a few English language 
  recipes is an adaption, as Spinach is a cool climate vegetable.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; Philippine eggplants (like Chinese, 
  except green and purple) would be most appropriate, but Chinese, 
  Japanese or Indian eggplants can be used. If all you have is big 
  Globe Eggplants, they must be peeled. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Peanut Butter:</h3> &nbsp; Some people grind up unsalted roasted 
  peanuts, but Peanut Butter is considered a very acceptable way to go. 
  Use an "All Natural" peanut butter with no sweeteners.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Toasted Rice:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important 
  ingredient all over Southeast Asia and should be kept on hand. To 
  make it, see our <a href="syv_ricetst1.html"><b>Toasted Sweet Rice 
  Powder</b></a> recipe.</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Annatto Water:</h3> &nbsp; Soak 2 T Annatto seeds in warm water for 
  30 minutes. You can crush the seeds after 20 minutes to get more 
  color. Strain. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sp_annattz.html">
  <b>Achiote / Annatto</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Bagoong:</h3> &nbsp; This is <u>Essential</u> to round out the 
  flavors of this recipe - <u>do no omit</u>. Preferably this will be 
  "Ginisang Bagoong" (Sauteed Shrimp Paste), available in just about 
  any Philippine market. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page. The Bagoong is sometimes combined with Calamansi or Lime Juice, 
  or Vinegar, or a combination.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp;  In the Philippines, the 
  Bagoong is always served separately, to be stirred in by individuals 
  as desired. Knowing to do this can not be expected of party guests in 
  North America, so I strongly suggest stirring in about 1/2 Tablespoon 
  (or more to taste) before setting the stew out for buffet service.</li>  
<li id="11">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe derives its 
  name from the Indian Tamil word "kari" (sauce) and the Malay penchant 
  for doubling words. Originally it was made with calf feet, producing 
  a rather gelatinous sauce. Today, most recipes call for Oxtail, which 
  was once food for the poor. It is now so expensive in North America 
  we are using Beef Shank instead. In the Philippines, several cuts of 
  beef are now used singly or in combination, and some recipes call for 
  Pork Hocks. The recipe above was compiled by me from recipes in 5 
  Philippine cookbooks.</li>
