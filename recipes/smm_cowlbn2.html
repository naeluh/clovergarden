This spectacularly delicious recipe expands the dark complimentary

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These have a darker, sweeter flavor and 
  stand up to cooking better than green beans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Cooking time is very short, so use a reasonably 
  tender cut like shoulder or tenderloin.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Crimson 
  Mushrooms". These are common in Laos and Cambodia, but not at all 
  available in North America. I suggest using one of the firmer varieties 
  of Oyster Mushrooms. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sweet Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  suggests ABC brand, which is widely available. If you have only regular 
  Soy Sauce, use it and add 1 T Blackstrap Molasses or Dark Brown Sugar.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Garlic was not listed but called out in the 
  steps, so the quantity is mine. The Mushrooms were called out in the 
  list, but not mentioned in the steps, so where I put them in is mine. 
  I also restepped the recipe a bit to more closely match the sequencing 
  of other Southeast Asian recipes. Some Cambodian recipes can be too 
  sweet for Western tastes (and health), so I have adjusted a bit, but 
  not drastically. The recipe calls for 1 t Dark Brown Sugar to be 
  caramalized in the oil before adding the Beef. I left this tricky step 
  out, and cut the Oyster Sauce a bit while increasing the Fish Sauce. 
  you may restore these if you wish.</li>
