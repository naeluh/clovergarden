Quite different from other Thai curries, Massamun curries are a Thai 
take on the aromatic Mughal cuisine of Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad 
adopted coconut and tamarind, making their curry more compatible 
with Thailand.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>If Using: &nbsp; Prepare <a href="skv_peanut1.html">
    <b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a> (20 min).</li>
  <li>Prepare <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_masmcurry1.html"><b>Mussamun Curry 
    Paste</b></a> (1-1/4 hrs).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs - 1-1/4 hr work)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into rough cubes about 1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Put plenty of water in a stew pot and bring to a boil over high 
    heat. Pour in the <b>ONIONS</b> and stir them around for 1 minute, 
    then scoop them out with a slotted spoon and refresh in cold water.
    </li>
  <li>Blanch <b>Beef</b> in in the same boiling water over high heat. 
    When it's come back to a boil for 2 minutes, drain and rinse (this 
    keeps the curry a nicer color). Clean the pot.</li>
  <li>Open 2 14 ounce cans of <b>Coconut Milk</b> without shaking. 
    Skim the cream off the top. You should get about 1 cup. Set the 
    cream aside.</li>
  <li>Put the remaining <b>Coconut Milk</b> in the pot along with the 
    <b>Beef</b>, <b>Bay Leaves</b>, and <b>Cinnamon</b>. Tap 
    <b>Cardamom Pods</b> to crack them and add to the pot along with 
    <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Bring to a boil uncovered (coconut milk foams up 
    as badly as cow milk), then reduce to a slow simmer.</li>
  <li>In a small saut&eacute; pan over moderate heat, simmer the 
    <b>Coconut Cream</b>, stirring constantly until oil just starts to 
    separate (there should be no browning), then stir in <b>Curry 
    Paste</b> until well blended. Add this to the simmering pot.</li>
  <li>Simmer <b>Beef</b> covered until it is nearly tender, which will be 
    around 1-1/2 hours depending on cut.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Cut tip end from <b>Onions</b> and peel 
    back the skin and any shriveling layers. Cut off the root end, taking 
    off the minimum so they hold together well.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut as necessary to make pieces about 1 
    inch on a side. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND JUICE</b> as necessary for the form you have 
    (See <a href="smm_cowmasm1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>When Beef is nearly done, stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Onions</b>. 
    Adjust liquid with boiling water if needed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind Juice</b>, <b>Lime Juice</b> and 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Add more of any one as needed to balance flavor.
    Take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with Twith plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Boiling Onions:</h3> &nbsp; These should be selected for small 
  size. If you don't have them use small regular onions cut lengthwise 
  into thick wedges, and skip the 1 minute boil.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mussamun Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; You probably won't find this in 
  stores, but we have a very good recipe for 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_masmcurry1.html"><b>Mussamun Curry Paste</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or Red potatoes will work well 
  here. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes which turn to mush if cooked a 
  bit long.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 1 T, or if it's block use about 1 T, soak with water to cover and 
  strain. If you don't have tamarind use 2 t lemon juice - not the same, 
  but it's something. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as 
  essential to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Peanuts, Dry Roasted:</h3> &nbsp; These dry pan roasted peanuts 
  are quite different in flavor and texture from commercially roasted 
  peanuts. Traditional, but I do not always use them. See our recipe 
  <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
