A simple stir fry in the Chinese style (oyster sauce, soy sauce and no 
hot chilis). It's shown here with noodles, but rice would also work. You 
can vary the vegetables depending on what you have on hand.

Thais consider all noodle dishes Chinese, whether the Chinese have ever 
made them or not, and noodles are the only thing Thais eat with 
chopsticks.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>NOODLES</b> in warm water until softened through. Drain 
    thoroughly and hold aside. You will need to get some salted water 
    boiling when the main recipe is almost done to cook them.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> 1/8 inch thick and cut into strips about 3/4 x 
    1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Remove leaves from <b>BROCCOLI</b> leaving the leaf stems with 
    the main stems. Cut the stems diagonally starting 1/4" thick at the 
    big end increasing to 1" long at the small end. Cut leaves into 
    pieces. Keep stems and leaves separate.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BABY CORN</b> cobs in thirds crosswise and add to 
    <b>Stems</b>.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into 1/4 inch strips and mix with 
    <b>Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b> (see <a href="smm_cowmixveg1.html#04">Note-4</a>).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Oyster Sauce</b>, <b>Soy Sauce</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Stock</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>2 t OIL</b> and fry 
    <b>Broccoli Stem mix</b> over high heat until you see just a touch 
    of browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broccoli Leaf Mix</b> and fry stirring until well coated 
    with oil. Scoop out all the vegetables with a slotted spoon and set 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>2 t Oil</b> and fry <b>Garlic</b> until it threatens to 
    color, then add <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color and all exuded moisture has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock Mix</b>, bring to a boil, cover and simmer until 
    beef is tender, 10 to 20 minutes depending on toughness.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vegetable Mix</b> and <b>Bean Sprouts</b> and bring back 
    to a simmer. Push the solids up the sides of the wok and sprinkle 
    in enough <b>Tapioca Starch</b> for the desired thickness (not 
    too thick).</li>
  <li>Cook your <b>Noodles</b> in boiling water about 3 minutes. drain 
    and put on plates. Spoon Beef over noodles and serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; These should be thin Asian "egg" noodles 
  (some actually have egg, others just yellow coloring) formerly labeled 
  "imitation noodle". For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_chthinz.html"><b>Chinese Egg Noodles, Thin</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chinese Broccoli:</h3> &nbsp; Other Asian greens or Italian Rappini 
  (Broccoli Rabe) can be substituted. Interestingly, Chinese broccoli is 
  actually broccoli while many other Asian greens are turnip greens - 
  but Rappini is a turnip green, not broccoli. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard & Turnip 
  Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; If I have one on hand, I'll use a red 
  Anaheim to give this dish just a touch of heat.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Soybean Sprouts:</h3> &nbsp; Asians have their obedient children 
  pinch the stringy root off of each sprout, but your kids would probably 
  refuse to leave their video games. Since Koreans here in Los Angeles 
  have the same problem, Korean markets here now carry packages of
  sprouts with the root end cut off.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Beef stock would be a natural, but chicken or 
  pork stock could also be used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tapioca Starch:</h3> &nbsp; This starch doesn't have as much 
  thickening power as corn starch but is more forgiving of just being 
  sprinkled in. If you us corn starch, use the usual water slurry 
  method to avoid lumps.</li>
