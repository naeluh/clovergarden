This stir fry can also be made with Pork or Chicken. Of "street food" 
origin it is tasty, quick to prepare and cooks in just a few minutes. 
You'll need a wok for space and easy to use tongs for handling the 
noodles.

In Vietnam and Thailand, Noodle dishes are considered Chinese, whether 
or not they have ever been made in China, so are usually not hot, but I 
like some hot sauce with this. In Thailand, noodles are the only dishes 
eaten with chopsticks.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> (see <a href="smm_cownoodv1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>) in 
    warm water for about 1/2 hour. Cut out hard attachment points and chop 
    very coarse.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>NOODLES</b> (see <a href="smm_cownoodv1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>) in warm 
    water for about 20 minutes until fully softened. Cook in boiling 
    salted water for 3 minutes, drain and mix with 1/2 T <b>Oil</b> so 
    they don't stick together. Cuting the lump so noodles are about 5 
    inches long will make them easier to handle in the pan, though Asians 
    would resist this.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into bitesize pieces about 1/8" thick and about 
    1-1/4 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into wide lengthwise wedges and cut the wedges in 
    half crosswise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>TOMATO</b> to match the onions. Peel or not as you wish 
    (I peel them).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CELERY</b> on a diagonal slant into medium slices.</li>
  <li>Mix all<b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>OIL</b> quite hot and 
    fry <b>Onion</b> stirring until well coated with oil, then stir in 
    <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until all raw color is gone and all 
    exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Black Fungus</b>, then <b>Celery</b>, then <b>Noodles</b>, 
    then <b>Tomatoes</b>. Toss and separate the noodles with tongs to 
    distribute with the other ingredients.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, bring to a boil, cover and simmer just a 
    minute or two and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; [Cloud Ear, Wood Ear, etc.] 
  <u>Weight given is after soaking</u> for accuracy. Dried (as sold) 
  that would be about 0.5 oz  to get 3 oz - these expand a lot. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chinese Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is for dry - but the 
  semi-dry "fresh" ones from the refrigerated section of Asian markets 
  are better (use 6 ounces). In either case you want the really thin 
  ones. Of course in Vietnam they'd be using just made fresh noodles. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_chthinz.html"><b>Chinese Thin Noodles</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
