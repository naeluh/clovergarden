Sold in Southern California as Ong Choy, Water Spinach is very popular 
with SE Asians. This simple stir fry provides good flavor 
and interesting texture. See also <a href="ssv_pakbung1.html">
<b>Meatless version</b></a> and <a href="csv_ongchoy1.html">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> thin (1/8 inch) into pieces about 2 inch by 1/2 inch.
    </li>
  <li>Pinch Leaves from <b>PAK BUNG</b> leaving their stems behind. Tear 
    into 3 inch lengths if too long. Discard overly thick stem ends (more 
    than 1/4 inch diameter) and cut all stems including leaf stems into 
    about 1-1/2 inch lengths - keep separate from leaves.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half 
    lengthwise and slice very thin. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very thin. 
    Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat 1 T <b>OIL</b> in a wok and fry <b>Beef</b> over highest 
    heat until it has completely lost its raw color, all exuded liquid 
    has evaporated and is cooked through. Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T more <b>OIL</b> and stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    just until garlic starts to color then stir in <b>Pak Bung Stems</b>. 
    Fry over high heat until partially wilted (about 2 minutes), then 
    stir in the <b>Pak Bung Leaves</b>. Continue frying for another 
    minute or so until leaves are mostly wilted. Larger stems should 
    remain a bit crunchy.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Beef</b>, then the <b>Sauce Mix</b>, and bring quickly 
    to a boil, stirring until beef is hot</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pak Bung / Water Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; To the 
  distress of many Southeast Asians Water Spinach is illegal in many states, 
  but here in California it may be sold by licensed growers and transported 
  within the state without a permit. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> control hotness to your taste. Three Thai chilis makes 
  it moderately spicy by Southern California standards. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Southeast 
  Asian sauce - you want the ugly brown version. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
