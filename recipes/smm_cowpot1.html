Burmese curries are quite different from those of both India and 
Thailand. Some beef is eaten in central Burma, but most by the Shan and 
Karen (say kaREN) near the border with Thailand.

    cut into 2 3-inch pieces. Discard tops.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> medium for Garnish.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LIME WEDGES</b> or squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b> (see Serving).
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)

  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry

    edges.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Grass</b> and fry stirring another 2 minutes.</li>

    it in just before serving.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat removed. This can 
  be a stewing cut such as round.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn 
  to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> Two chilis gives this recipe a noticeable but 
  not imposing heat. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Chilis - Thailand &amp; Southeast 
  Asia</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is from a Burmese 
  restaurant in Oakland, California owned and staffed by Burmese 
  immigrants. They add about 1/2 tablespoon of Madras curry powder 
  and 1/3 teaspoon of garam masala to this recipe. All my other 
  Burmese cookbooks assure me dry spice mixes are <u>not</u> used 
  in Burma. I presume this is an adjustment for American expectations, 
  and I have omitted these. They also included 1 Bay Leaf. Bay Leaves 
  (a little different from ours) are used in India, but I don't know 
  if they are used in Burma.</li>
