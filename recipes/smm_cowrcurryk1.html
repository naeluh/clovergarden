This Beef dish uses Red Curry Paste, but  isn't a curry. Beef fans will 
like this dish, and it isn't overly "spicy" (I provide 
<a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a> to fix 
that at the table).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Krachai Roots:</h3> &nbsp; These are long narrow relatives of 
  ginger. The flavor is milder and much more earthy. They are hard to 
  find fresh but are available frozen and brined. I have found brined 
  ones in jars quite satisfactory. If you have to use ginger, use half 
  as much and chop it fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_krachz.html"><b>Krachai</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These Asian beans, have a special afinity 
  for beef.  They are close relatives of the Black Eye Pea, but grown for 
  fresh pods, not beans. If you can't get them, use regular green beans 
  and add them a bit later to avoid over cooking. The flavor and texture 
  will be different, but still good. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red Fresno chilis, but 
  Holland Red or similar will work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1 stem. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the standard Thai 
  chili pastes. It is available commercially in jars, but it's better 
  made by our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. "Red Curry Sauce" sold in yuppie markets 
  is nothing like it.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
