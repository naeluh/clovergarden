A light flavorful curry with plenty of beef and contrasting crunchy bamboo 
shoots. It has moderate chili bite, which you can regulate by the amount 
and hotness of your red curry paste.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into strips less than 1/4 inch thick about 2 
    inches long and 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> fairly thin.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> into slices similar in size to the Beef. If 
    they were canned, blanch in boiling water for 5 minutes to remove the 
    tinniness (not needed for the more modern vacuum pack). Weight given is 
    drained.</li> 
  <li>Roll up <b>LIME LEAVES</b> and slice into very fine threads, discarding 
    the central rib.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPER</b> into slivers.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems, split them in half lengthwise 
    if very large, or if rather small double the quantity. Set to soaking in 
    cold water (keeps them green longer).</li>
  <li>Grind together <b>Coriander</b> and <b>Cumin</b>, mix with 
    <b>Paprika</b> (for color).</li>
  <li>Separate <b>Coconut Milk</b>. Skim 1/3 cup off the top (the cream) 
    and keep it separate from the rest of the can.</li>
  <li>Mix the rest of the <b>Coconut Milk</b> with the <b>Stock</b>, 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Lime Leaves</b>.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Blanch <b>Beef</b> in boiling water over high heat. As soon as it 
    comes back to a boil and foams up, drain and rinse (this keeps the 
    curry a nicer color).</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Shallots</b> and <b>Red Curry Paste</b> gently until evenly blended 
    with the oil and aromatic but not at all browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in the 1/3 cup of <b>Coconut Cream</b> and the 
    <b>Spice mix</b>. Fry stirring until well mixed.</li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until well mixed with the 
    seasonings.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Stock mix</b>, <b>Lime Leaves</b> and <b>Bamboo 
    Shoots</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for about 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Bell Peppers</b> for about 1 minute. Take off heat. 
    Drain and stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. While the 
    basil leaves won't be as green, this dish reheats very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essential Thai 
  curry pastes . Different brands and recipes vary, but the amount in 
  this recipe is scaled for our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a> which is pretty hot.</li>
