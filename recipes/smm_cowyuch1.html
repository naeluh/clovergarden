This very tasty stir-fry of Beef with Yu Choy. Other choys could also be 
used with some change in flavor and texture. This recipe is somewhat in the 
Chinese mode as Thais recognize oyster sauce as a Chinese ingredient.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> across the grain about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 
    strips about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Massage well into <b>Beef</b> 
    along with <b>Black Pepper</b>. Set aside to marinate for at least 
    20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from the stems and set soaking in cold 
    water.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>YU CHOY</b> and cut it whichever way you like. Stems do not 
    need to be held separate unless they are quite large but I usually do 
    anyway.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO</b> into strips of size similar to the Beef.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> into very thin strips.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Drain <b>Basil</b> and cut into narrow strips for garnish.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring over high flame until it has completely lost 
    its raw color and all exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bamboo</b>, <b>Chilis</b> and <b>Yu Choy Stems</b> 
     (if separate) and fry stirring about 2 minutes, then stir in 
     <b>Yu Choy Leaves</b> until wilted coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Simmer covered, turning 
    now and then until Yu Choy stems are crisp tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat trimmed away. Use a reasonably tender cut such as shoulder as 
  cooking time is short.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yu Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This is an edible version of the 
  plant that produces the seeds canola oil is processed from. It is now 
  widely grown in North America and readily available in most markets serving 
  an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_yuchz.html"><b>Yu Choy</b></a> page. You can use 
  other forms of choy as alternatives, but but in most cases give the 
  stems more of a lead over the leaves in cooking. The flavor will be a 
  bit different and in most cases less sweet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
