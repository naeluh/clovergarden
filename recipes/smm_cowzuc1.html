Simple and satisfying, and it's easy to control the chili heat. With 
just a little bite it's good for people new to Thai cuisine - but 
<a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a> will fix it 
for the rest.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> across the grain into thin strips 2 to 3 inches long 
    and 1/2 inch or so wide. This is easiest if the meat is put in the freezer 
    compartment until a bit stiff.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ZUCCHINI</b> into juliennes about 2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> diagonally into 1 inch lengths, white and green.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin 
    and chop fine. Chop <b>CHILIS</b> fine. Mix all.</li> 
  <li>Strip tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. Smash the bottom third with your kitchen mallet and slice 
    the smashed part crosswise very thin. Chop fine and mix with 
    <b>Garlic Mix</b>.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1 T <b>OIL</b> over 
    moderate heat and fry <b>Zucchini</b> stirring until crisp tender. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon leaving all oil behind.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Scallions</b> and fry stirring for about 1-1/2 minutes. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and add to Zucchini.</li>
  <li>Add 1/2 T <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    until aromatic, then, turn heat to very high and stir in the 
    <b>Beef</b>. Fry stirring until beef has completely lost its raw 
    color, any exuded liquid has evaporated, and the beef is frying 
    again.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and fry stirring for a minute or so, then 
    stir in <b>Zucchini</b> and <b>Scallions</b> until well distributed.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Lime Juice</b> and immediately take off the heat.
  </li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> and serve with plenty of steamed 
    Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Three Thai chilis gives it just a noticeable 
  bite. If you don't have Thai chilis, one small Serrano will do 
  - not as hot but a lot larger. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Vinegar Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; One of the three 
  essential Thai table condiments - easy to make - see our recipe for 
  <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Do they actually have Zucchinis in Thailand? 
  Is there any place in the world they don't have Zucchinis? This Italian 
  squash was first popularized in Los Angeles restaurants. From there, 
  it spread quickly, both east and west, even all the way back to Italy.
