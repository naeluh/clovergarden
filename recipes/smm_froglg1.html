A tasty dish of Frog Legs is much liked in South Vietnam, where frogs 
abound, and they eat the back meat also, but here in California we're 
pretty much limited to frozen legs.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Frog Legs:</h3> &nbsp; One Los Angeles Asian market (San Gabriel), 
  serving a mixed Vietnamese Chinese community, occasionally does a 
  brisk business in live frogs - but most of us will make do with frozen 
  frog legs. Look in Asian markets in the frozen food cases. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/rp_frogz.html"><b>Frogs</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken Powder:</h3> &nbsp; East and Southeast Asian recipes 
  presume availabilty of Chicken Broth, often used in small amounts. 
  This is not always practical these days, so Chicken Powder has come 
  into use to make up broth quickly. It has also found use as a 
  general seasoning. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Powder</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sate Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is a Chili Garlic Sauce flavored with 
  Lemon Grass. It is used in the recipe and the oil from this sauce was 
  used for garnish. See our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_vsate1.html"><b>Sate Sauce</b></a>. Other chili garlic 
  sauces could be used.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cooking Time:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 10 minutes 
  total cooking "or until tender". For the 4/6 pairs / pound frog legs 
  we have around here, that isn't enough. At 8 minutes they start falling 
  apart but are still a bit rubbery. At around 20 minutes they are tender 
  enough and haven't fallen apart much more, so I say go with a longer 
  cooking time unless your frog legs are much smaller and proven tender.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is not a dish you'd serve at a 
  formal dinner. It is, however, fine and entertaining for private 
  dining or informal parties. You will need paper napkins and bone bowls.
