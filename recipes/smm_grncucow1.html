  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>Beef</b> about 1/8 inch across the grain and cut into 
    strips about 1-1/2 by 3/4 inches.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise into 6 wedges (if Thai eggplants 
    - see <a href="smm_grncucow1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for options). Keep eggplants 
    in cold water acidulated with some Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>LIME LEAVES</b> tightly and slice into fine threads. 
    Chop the threads into smaller lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> into thin strips.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and start soaking in cold 
    water (this is so they stay green longer in the curry).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat and stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> until it is well distributed and 
    aromatic, but no browining.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Beef</b> and stir fry a few minutes until all 
    raw color is gone and all exuded liquid has evaporated. It needs to 
    be fried a bit more than chicken or pork or it will make the curry 
    muddy, but don't overdo the heat as there should be little browning. 
    See also <a href="smm_grncucow1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Lime Leaf</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until Beef is 
    tender, about 35 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant</b> and continue to simmer until just tender but 
    not mushy, about 13 minutes for Thai eggplants, a bit less for 
    others. See also <a href="smm_grncucow1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a></li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Red Chili</b> for just a minute, then 
    stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>. Serve immediately with plenty of steamed 
    Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed. I prefer Chuck (Shoulder) which is tender enough and has 
  good flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; These are green and white and golf ball 
  size. They cook significantly differently from other eggplants and are 
  well worth searching out. If you don't have them use Indian eggplants 
  which are purple and egg size, so cut them into more pieces and cook 
  just a bit less. Lacking even those use Japanese or Italian eggplants 
  split in half lengthwise and cut crosswise about 3/4 inch thick. Cook 
  those even less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I usually use red Fresnos (moderately hot). You 
  could use fresh red Thai chilis (much smaller but much hotter) or 
  Holland Red (moderately hot) - your choice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Green Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essentials of 
  Thai cooking - and the hottest of the Thai curry pastes. It is 
  available commercially (with a lot of variation between brands), 
  but the amount in this recope is scaled for our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_grncurry1.html"><b>Green Curry Paste</b></a>, which 
  is fairly hot.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; If you want beef curry to be as light in color 
  as other green curries, after cutting the beef, put it in a sauce pan 
  with water to cover, bring it to a boil for about 1 minute, then strain 
  and rinse.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Pea Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; Thai cooks often toss in a handful of 
  Thai Pea Eggplants along with the green eggplants. Unfortunately these 
  are nearly impossible to get even in Los Angeles.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Long Beans have a great affinity for Beef, 
  so some recipes cut the Eggplant to 4 ounces and include 2 ounces of 
  Long Beans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page. 
  Because methods differ somewhat, we have prepared separate versions for 
  <a href="smc_grncuchk1.html"><b>Chicken</b></a>, 
  <a href="smm_grncupig1.html"><b>Pork</b></a>,
  <a href="smf_grncusmp1.html"><b>Shrimp</b></a>, and
