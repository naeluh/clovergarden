This is a classic Thai curry. Though most often made with chicken, pork, 
beef, fish and shrimp are also popular. Because methods differ somewhat, 
we have prepared separate versions - see <a href="smm_grncupig1.html#07">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>Pork</b> about 1/8 inch with the grain, and cut into 
    strips about 1-1/2 by 3/4 inches, or whatever works with your pork. 
    Unfortunately pigs are not rectangular.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise into 6 wedges (if Thai eggplants 
    - see <a href="smm_grncupig1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for options). Keep eggplants 
    in cold water acidulated with some Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Roll up <b>LIME LEAVES</b> tightly and slice into fine threads. 
    Chop the threads into smaller lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> into thin strips.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and start soaking in cold 
    water (this is so they stay green longer in the curry).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat and stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> until it is well distributed and 
    aromatic, but no browining.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Pork</b> and stir fry a few minutes until all 
    raw color is gone and it is well coated with the curry paste.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Lime Leaf</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> 
    and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until Pork 
    is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant</b> and continue to simmer until just tender 
    but not mushy, about 13 minutes for Thai eggplants, a bit less for 
    others. See also <a href="smm_grncupig1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a></li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Red Chili</b> for just a minute, 
    then stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>. Serve immediately with plenty of 
    steamed Jasmine rice or with Asian noodles nested in a bowl</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess fat 
  removed. Most cuts can be used, but I usually use leg as it is 
  inexpensive and high in flavor. Loin is more tender but has the 
  least flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; These are green and white and golf ball 
  size. They cook significantly differently from other eggplants and are 
  well worth searching out. If you don't have them use Indian eggplants 
  which are purple and egg size, so cut them into more pieces and cook 
  just a bit less. Lacking even those use Japanese or Italian eggplants 
  split in half lengthwise and cut crosswise about 3/4 inch thick. Cook 
  those even less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; I usually use red Fresnos (moderately hot). You 
  could use fresh red Thai chilis (much smaller but much hotter) or 
  Holland Red (moderately hot) - your choice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Green Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essentials of 
  Thai cooking - and the hottest of the Thai curry pastes. It is 
  available commercially (with a lot of variation between brands), 
  but the amount in this recope is scaled for our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_grncurry1.html"><b>Green Curry Paste</b></a>, which 
  is fairly hot.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Pea Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; Thai cooks often toss in a handful of 
  Thai Pea Eggplants along with the green eggplants. Unfortunately these 
  are nearly impossible to get even in Los Angeles.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Because methods differ somewhat, we have 
  prepared separate versions for 
  <a href="smm_grncucow1.html"><b>Beef</b></a>, 
  <a href="smc_grncuchk1.html"><b>Chicken</b></a>,
  <a href="smf_grncusmp1.html"><b>Shrimp</b></a>, and
  <a href="smf_grncufsh1.html"><b>Fish</b></a> Green Curries.</li>
