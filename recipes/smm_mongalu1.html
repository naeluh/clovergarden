This is a very popular "comfort food" dish in the Philippines. It has 
several minor variations. Some recipes omit the shrimp, some omit the 
pork, and some omit both for a vegetarian version.

  <b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 hrs - 5 minutes work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>Mung Beans</b> with 1/2 T salt per cup of beans. This is 
    optional, but will make cooking faster and help keep the beans 
    intact. Yes, salt. See our <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>
    Soaking / Brining Dried Beans</b></a> page. Drain and rinse.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (37 min - exclusive of peeling shrimp)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cover <b>Mung Beans</b> with water, bring to a boil and simmer 
    until done, 10 minutes if soaked, 30 to 45 minutes if not soaked.
    Drain.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>MALABAR SPINACH</b>. Discard stems over 1/4 inch diameter 
    and excessively damaged leaves. Cut remaining stems diagonally about 
    1 inch long. Cut leaves into strips about 1 x 1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick and cut into pieces about 
    1 inch on a side, or whatever works with your pork.</li>
  <li>Shell and de-vein <b>SHRIMP</b> if not already done. If large, 
    cut in half.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
   <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over high 
    heat. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until Onion is 
    translucent, then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Continue to fry stirring 
    for another 3 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until it has completely 
    lost its raw color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
    Cover and keep at a simmer until Pork is tender, about 20 minutes.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Mung Beans</b>. Bring back to a simmer for 
    about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Stir in <b>Shrimp</b> 
    and cook stirring now and then until the Shrimp have turned color. 
    Adjust liquid if needed, this recipe 
    should finish with some free liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Malabar Spinach</b>, bring back to a boil. Cook,  
    tumbling often, until wilted and of uniform color, about 3 minutes. 
    Do not overcook.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Alugbati (Philippine), Mong Toi 
  (Viet)] &nbsp; This leafy, almost succulent green is available in 
  Asian markets, often labeled "Mong Toi". Keep in mind it is easily 
  damaged and doesn't store well. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for head-off 
  small or medium shrimp.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp;  This can be a light Pork, Chicken or Beef 
  stock, or water with a teaspoon of Chicken Powder added, or just 
  water.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page. A pure vegetarian version 
  would use Soy Sauce.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe did not call for peeling 
  the tomatoes, but I prefer to avoid bits of tomato skin floating 
  around in my recipes. It takes almost no additional time. If making 
  ahead, it would be good to leave out the Malabar Spinach until reheat 
  and serve time, though it does OK with a quick reheating, with the 
  spinach in. </li>
