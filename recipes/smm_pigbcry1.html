  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make your Shrimp Paste (<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sif_kapikung1.html"><b>Kapi 
    Kung</b></a>) if you want maximum attainable authenticity.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>PORK BELLY</b> into pieces about 1-1/2 inches long (thickness 
    of belly) by 1/2 inch thick and 1 inch wide. Cut <b>PORK</b> into 
    chunks of similar size to the Pork Belly, removing excess fat. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise, then slice halves thin 
    lengthwise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 1-1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Separate and peel segments of <b>PICKLED GARLIC</b>, retaining 
    all liquid (some will be used in this recipe).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin, then cut slices into 
    narrow matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> as needed (unless using from a jar). For 
    method see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a>  
    page.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PALM SUGAR</b> small. Mix with <b>Fish Sauce</b>, 
    <b>Black Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Garlic Liquid</b> (from the jar).</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Curry Powder</b> and <b>Turmeric</b>.</li>
 </ol>
  <b><u>Seasoning Paste</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="10"> 
  <li>This can be made days in advance and refrigerated. Prep these 
    items and smash to paste in a big granite mortar <u>in the order 
    given here</u> - hardest first, stickiest last - BUT, do read 
    <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/15"><b>Note-15</b></a> for hints on how to make it easier. 
    Prep <b>LEMON GRASS</b> per <a href="smm_pigbcry1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>. Peel 
    <b>GALANGAL</b> (yes, that much) and slice as thin as you can get 
    it (see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> 
    page for method), then chop into small pieces. Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> 
    in half lengthwise, then slice thin crosswise. </li>
  <li>Break <b>PUYA CHILIS</b> and pour out seeds. Discard stems and 
    caps. Run them to small flake in your Mini-prep Food Processor or 
    Spice Grinder. Mix into the <b>Paste</b></li>
  <li>Mix <b>Kapi Kung</b> into <b>Paste</b>. Pound until it's all even.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol start="13">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate flame  
    until it shimmers (about 300&deg;F/150&deg;C) and stir in <b>Seasoning 
    Paste</b> until it is well distributed and fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
  <li>Stir in <b>Shallots</b> until softened, then <b>Curry Powder</b> and 
    <b>Turmeric</b>. Stir until fragrant, but take care, Turmeric Powder 
    burns easily.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork Mix</b> and tumble until coated with the 
    Seasonings.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Palm Sugar mix</b> until sugar has pretty much dissolved, 
    then stir in <b>Tamarind Paste</b> and 2 c <b>Water</b>. Bring to 
    a boil. Turn down flame, cover tightly, and hold at a light simmer 
    for 45 minutes. </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger</b> and continue to simmer, now uncovered, until 
    the Pork Shoulder is very tender but not falling apart, about 45 
    minutes. The curry sauce should end up quite soupy, so re-cover if 
    needed so it comes out right.</li>
  <li>When the <b>Curry</b> is about done, check it for flavor balance 
    and correct if needed.</li>
  <li>stir in the <b>Pickled Garlic</b> (split lengthwise if cloves are 
    large) and the <b>Long Beans</b>. Continue to simmer until the Beans 
    are crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with a garnish of <b>Crispy Shallots</b>. This dish is 
    usually accompanied by steamed sticky rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; This is available in every Asian market 
  that sells meats, and also from Mexican Carnicerias. The pattern 
  recipe calls for skinless, but it is always sold skin-on in the Asian 
  markets, and that's the way it is usually used, so I leave it on, 
  which adds an additional textural element.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Any reasonably lean cut will work fine, shoulder, 
  leg or cushion meat (actually boneless chunks of shoulder). Loin will 
  work, but has less flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These green Asian beans, up to 28 inches 
  long, are now very common here in Southern California, even in 
  non-specialty markets. They have a very different flavor and texture 
  than regular green beans. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickled Garlic:</h3> &nbsp; These are whole small heads of garlic, 
  pickled and put up in jars of the pickling liquid. For details, see 
  our <a href="../ingred/li_garpklz.html"><b>Thai Pickled Garlic</b></a> 
  page. They can easily be made at home by our recipe 
  <a href="siv_garpkl1.html"><b>Pickled Garlic</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tamarind Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is available in several forms, 
  some needing preparation, others not. For details and method see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3>> &nbsp; This flavorful sugar can be found in any 
  market serving a Southeast Asian community, and in some Indian markets. 
  If you don't have palm sugar, use an amber sugar like Turbinado.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Black Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably this will be a Thai Black 
  Soy Sauce, which is a bit different from the Chinese Dark Soy Sauce.
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; You'll need about 3 good size stalks. 
  Peel off hard outer layers - the last layer you pull off should be 
  distinctly purple on the inside. Cut off exposed core. With your 
  kitchen mallet smash the bottom 5 inches well (a slug of hard core 
  will be ejected). Slice crosswise as thin as you can manage. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon 
  Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; This member of the Ginger family is available 
  from markets serving a Southeast Asian community. It is an essential 
  ingredient, and can be found fresh or frozen. It is very hard. For 
  details and method for slicing see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Puya Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; 1/4 ounce = about 4. These are a 
  substitute for unavailable Thai Prik Kaeng dried red chilis. They are 
  available from some markets serving a Mexican community. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Kapi Kung</h3> This is the shrimp paste of northern Thailand. It 
  is not currently available in North America and must be faked up. See 
  our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sif_kapikung1.html"><b>Thai Shrimp Paste - 
  Northern</b></a>. It can be made a week or more ahead and 
  refrigerated.</li>
<li id="13">
  <h3>Curry Powder:</h3> &nbsp; A fairly mild Indian type Curry 
  Powder is used (infrequently) in Thailand. A Madras type powder can 
  be used.</li>
<li id="14">
  <h3>Crisp Shallots:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very popular garnish in 
  Thailand and Vietnam. It is simple and easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="siv_shalfry1.html"><b>Fried Shallots / Shallot Oil</b></a>. 
  These can be made a couple days ahead.</li>
<li id="15">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; I am strong and in good health, but I am not 
  Hercules, so I have made changes in procedure that greatly reduce 
  pounding in my big granite mortar, with a 3 pound pestle. Unfortunately, 
  no machinery available in even a well equipped kitchen can produce the 
  results of pounding in a mortar, so a fair amount of pounding is still 
  needed - just not as heroic an amount.
  <ol>
  <li>Prep all <b>Seasoning Paste items</b> as given above, as if you 
    were going to pound them in the mortar.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>Lemon Grass</b> in a mini-prep food processor until it 
    is as fine as it will get. Add <b>Galangal</b> and process until it 
    is as fine as it will get. Add <b>Shallots</b> and process until 
    they are as fine as they will get.</li>
  <li>Transfer contents of the mini-prep to the mortar and pound 
    everything as best you have stamina for.</li>
  <li>Stir in the ground <b>Puya Chilis</b> and <b>Kapi Kung</b>. 
    Pound some more until everything is evenly mixed.</li>
    </ol>
  The pattern recipe has you soak the Chilis and pound them in the 
  mortar. I've done enough Mexican cooking to know this takes a lot of 
  pounding, because the skins are tough - so I always just grind 
  chilis dry - it works fine in a spice grinder.</li>
<li id="16">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Fortunately the "Low Fat Diet" is on it's 
  last legs - it didn't work - so now you can feel fine indulging in 
  flavorful Pork Belly. It's a lot healthier than the dangerous trans 
  fats and polyunsaturated fats the American Heart Association spent 
  50 years urging to eat instead.
  <br>This dish probably originated in Chang Mai more than 300 year ago 
  when Burma ruled the region. As with most ancient dishes, this one is 
  made in many variations. The curry can be anywhere from soup-like to 
  almost dry. If it is made with toasted peanuts instead of long beans, 
  it's a modern version. If it comes with all pork belly and no lean 
  pork, it's a retro version.</li>
