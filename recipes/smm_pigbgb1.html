  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK BELLY</b> into 3/8 inch square strips the length of the 
    pork belly thickness. Each should have skin on one end.</li>
  <li>Tip and tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> and cut into about 1-1/2 inch lengths. 
    Bring lightly salted water to a boil and cook Green Beans until just 
    barely crisp tender. Drain and refresh with cold water.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into quarters lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>SHRIMP</b> in your spice grinder. Measure is whole, or broken 
    some if large.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over high flame. Stir 
    in <b>Pork Belly</b> and fry stirring until it is very lightly browned.
    </li>
  <li>At this point, you probably have more oil in the pan than you want. 
    pour out excess, but there should be about a Tablespoon left.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and continue to fry stirring until Onions 
    are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b>, then <b>Dried Shrimp</b> until 
    well distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Cream</b> and <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. 
    Simmer until Pork Belly is tender enough.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Green Beans</b> bring back to a boil and simmer a minute 
    or 2.</li> 
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Belly:</h3> &nbsp; Buy Skin-on pork belly, easily available 
  in markets serving Asian and Latino communities. You could use some 
  other cut of pork, but it wouldn't be as delicious - and besides, 
  the whole <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a>" 
  thing turned out to be a fraud perpetrated by the sugar industry, 
  using the usual paid for "science".</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> Measure is broken to fit the measure lightly 
  packed - fill a 1/4 cup measure half full. Southeast Asians use tiny 
  dried shrimp crushed - but Americans aren't accustomed to prickly 
  things in their food, so I run them to powder in the spice grinder. 
  Powdered, 1/8 cup of shrimp is about 3/4 T. If you are in doubt about 
  the dried shrimp, just double the amount of fish sauce and leave it 
  out. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpdryz.html">
  <b>Dried Shrimp</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as important to 
  Southeast Asian cooking as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Coconut Cream:</h3> &nbsp; This is available in 5.8 oz cans and 
  6.8 ounce wax boxes, as well as 14 ounce cans. Alternately, you can 
  open a 14 ounce can of good quality Coconut Milk without shaking it, 
  and scoop the cream off the top - just drink the rest. 
  Products from Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia are best.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; You could also make this with less fatty pork, 
  but flavor would be different and simmer time would be longer. Don't be 
  afraid of Pork Belly (uncured bacon), the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been entirely 
  discredited, and was fraudulent from the get go.</li>
