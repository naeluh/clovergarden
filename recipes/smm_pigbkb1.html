  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li><h3>IF</h3> <b>Using PORK HOCKS</b>, use 2-1/2 pounds cut into convenient 
    chunks. Usually you will buy them already sliced. It is easy to cut them 
    into two or four pieces (depending on size) with a sharp Chinese cleaver 
    knife driven by a soft faced mallet. I usually par boil and rinse, but 
    Filipinos don't bother.</li>
  <li><h3>IF</h3> <b>Using PORK BELLY</b> or <b>BONELESS PORK</b> use 
    2 pounds cut into chunks about 1 inch by  1-1/2 inches. Weight is 
    with any exposed fat removed on the non-skin side. Most recipes have 
    you fry the Pork Belly in some oil until lightly browned, some after 
    marinading in the liquid ingredients, some not.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Peanuts</b> coarse or leave whole or omit them as you wish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Put <b>All items</b> in a stew pot, bring to a boil and simmer for 
    1-1/2 hours (a little less for pork belly and boneless pork).</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is most traditionally made with Pork 
  Belly or Pork Hocks (less fat). Pork belly is skin-on and hocks are 
  fresh not smoked. Both items are easily available in meat markets 
  serving an East or Southeast Asian or Mexican community. If you buy 
  whole hocks, have the meat market saw them crosswise to about 1-1/2 
  inch thick - usually they are already sawed and a bit thinner than that.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peanuts:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes do not use peanuts, and 
  personally I don't care for them that much. If you do use them, they 
  should be roasted and unsalted. They are <u>way</u> <u>better</u> if 
  you dry roast raw peanuts yourself. See our recipe 
  <a href="skv_peanut1.html"><b>Dry Roasted Peanuts</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Preferable use one of the fine Philippine 
  cane or palm vinegars, but lacking those, distilled white vinegar 
  will serve, though harsher. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for 3 tablespoons, which is 
  way too much for me. Properly this is Palm Sugar, but if you don't have 
  that use a semi-refined sugar like turbinado.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are fermented black soybeans, 
  available from most Asian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_blackfz.html"><b>Black Bean</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp;  Today some use cubes of boneless pork for 
  reduced fat, but the result will be much less rich, especially if 
  there is no skin. Treat these like pork belly. Some recipes add some 
  chunked Potatoes when there's about 20 minutes to go (you'll need a 
  little more water). Some recipes add Banana Blossom, but you may find 
  that too bitter for your taste.</li>
