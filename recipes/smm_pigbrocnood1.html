Typical of Cambodian cooking this tasty broccoli and noodle dish is 
"hottened" with black pepper rather than chilis. Of the accompanying 
condiments, <a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tik Marij</b></a> would be 
authentic Cambodian and the Chili Garlic Sauce more Thai or Vietnamese, 
but I like it anyway.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min exclusive of soaking noodles)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>FRESH RICE NOODLES</b>, separate into strands 
    and cut into about 3 inch lengths.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>DRIED RICE NOODLES</b>, break into about 3 inch 
    lengths and soak in warm water about 1 hour. See 
    <a href="smm_pigbrocnood1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>  
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and cut into medallions about 1 inch by 2 
    inches.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BROCCOLI</b> leaves and tender flower heads from the 
    stems and tear into pieces about 1 inch on a side. Slice stems 
    diagonally about 1/4 inch at the thick end increasing to 1 inch at 
    the thin end.  Keep leaves separate from stems.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Dump <b>EGGS</b> out of their shells into a bowl. Break up the 
    yolks, but don't beat.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>1 T Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Have everything ready - this will go fast.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic</b> until it shows a little color, then stir in 
    <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until it has completely lost its raw 
    color.</li>
  <li>Push pork up the sides and pour in <b>Eggs</b>. Let them set up some 
    (you don't want them too jumbled), then gently stir the pork into 
    them.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Stock mix</b>, then the <b>Broccoli stems</b>. Cover 
    and simmer until stems are starting to get tender, then stir in the 
    leaves. Cover and simmer a few minutes until stems are crisp tender.
    </li>
  <li>Stir up the <b>Cornstarch mix</b> to make sure it's suspended, then 
    stir into the pan until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Scatter the <b>Rice Noodles</b> on top, and tumble them in the 
    minimum needed to get them well distributed and hot. If you used dry 
    noodles tumble just a bit longer until they are tender.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fresh rice noodles. Wide 
  noodles are good here. If using dried noodles, use half the weight 
  and soak in warm water for 45 minutes to an hour. The photo example 
  was made with fresh noodles cut from Rice Paper Sheet. When Using 
  fresh noodles separate them before starting to cook, cut to about 3 
  inches long, spread them out and keep them fluffed so they don't stick 
  together. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chinese Broccoli:</h3> &nbsp; [Gai-Lan] This is very similar 
  to Italian broccoli (which is actually a turnip green) except the 
  leaves are a lot larger. If all you have is regular broccoli cut into 
  small florets and discard the tough main stem. You'll have to start 
  with a bit more weight because of that. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_brocccz.html"><b>Chinese Broccoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; If using dried noodles you'll need 
  just a little more stock. Chicken or Pork stock will work.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are not 
  familiar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Tik Marij</h3> &nbsp; The ever-present Cambodian table condiment, 
  very easy to make fresh. For details see our recipe 
  <a href="sjv_tikmarij1.html"><b>Tik Marij</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous 
  Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce (cylindrical bottle, not the squeeze 
  bottle) will do just fine. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html#asia"><b>Chili Sauces &amp; 
  Potions</b></a> page.</li>
