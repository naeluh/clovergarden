While <b>Gai Lan</b> (Chinese broccoli) is more often associated with 
beef, this pork recipe is just delicious.  I say "Thai Style" because the 
ecipe is from a lady in Ohio, who may not be Thai, but the ingredients 
are all authentic.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 minutes)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> into strips about 1/8 inch thick, 1/4 inch 
    wide and 1-1/2 inches long. Cut with the grain so the strips hold 
    together.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade Items</b> and massage into the pork. Let stand 
    for at least 20 minutes, then set in a strainer to drain thoroughly, 
    reserving the liquid to add to the sauce mix.</li>
  <li>Strip leaves and tender tops from <b>GAI LAN</b>. Cut leaves into 
    fairly large pieces. Slice stems (including leaf stems) on a shallow 
    diagonal starting at about 1/2 inch at the big end and increasing to 
    about 1-1/2 inches at the thin end. Keep leaves and stems separate.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Shallots</b> in half lengthwise, then slice very thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very thin. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b> along with the reserved 
    <b>Marinade</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 minutes)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Shallots</b> until they start to color. </li>
  <li>Spread out shallots and spread drained <b>Pork</b> over them. Let sit 
    for a minute, then add the <b>Garlic mix</b>. Stir it all up. Fry 
    stirring over high heat until pork loses all its raw color and any 
    exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Gai Lan Stems</b>. Fry stirring over moderate heat for 
    about 3 minutes, making sure you don't burn the coating stuck to the 
    wok - it's part of the recipe.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Gai Lan Leaves</b> until coated with oil, then stir in 
    <b>Sauce mix</b>, cover and simmer until thick stems are crisp tender 
    and still a bit crunchy. Tumble a couple times and scrap up the coating 
    from the wok.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat and stir in <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Gai Lan:</h3> &nbsp; This green looks much like Italian Rapini, 
  but in an odd reversal it's actually broccoli, while Rapini is turnip 
  greens. Most other Asian "cabbages" are actually turnip greens. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cb_brocccz.html">
  <b>Chinese Broccoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless pork with 
  all excess fat removed.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a drinkable grade of Chinese 
  rice wine (the cooking versions are heavily salted and rather awful). 
  If you don't have the rice wine use a dry sherry (sake is not 
  considered a good substitute). For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Red or green (same heat). 
  Five, just under 2 inches long, make this dish "satisfyingly spicy" by 
  Southern California standards. Fresh Arbols, (about 3) are a good 
  substitute, or 2 Serranos (much larger). Vary the quantity depending on 
  the tolerance of your guests and hotness of your chilis. If some can't 
  take the heat go light on the chilis and serve with Thai 
  <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a>. For 
  details see our  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Southeast Asia 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have palm 
  sugar use a light turbinado or similar sugar. Palm is similar but 
  tastier. Actually, I just use 2 Tablespoons of the Oyster Sauce and 
  skip the sugar. </li>
