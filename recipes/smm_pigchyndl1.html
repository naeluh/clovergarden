I call this delicious recipe "Thai / California", because, while all 
ingredients and methods are Thai, this recipe is an adaption, see 
<a href="smm_pigchyndl1.html#08"><b>Comments</b></a>. Working with the noodles is a 
tricky, so read the notes.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min exclusive of soaking noodles)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>FRESH RICE NOODLES</b>, separate into strands 
    and cut into about 3 inch lengths.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>DRIED RICE NOODLES</b>, break into about 3 inch 
    lengths and soak in warm water about 1 hour. See 
    <a href="smm_pigchyndl1.html#01">Note-1</a>.</li>       
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick and into strips about 3/4 
    inch x 1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Cut or tear <b>CHOY</b> leaves into 2 inch pieces. Cut stems 
    at a very shallow diagonal into "horse ears" about 1/4 inch thick at 
    the base end increasing to 1 inch at the thin end. Keep stems separate 
    from leaves and tender tips.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with 3 T <b>Water</b>.</li>
   </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Everything must be ready - this will go very fast.</li>
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic</b> stirring until the first hint of color, then turn the 
    heat to very high and stir in <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until the 
    Pork has lost all it's raw color and any exuded liquid has evaporated.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Choy Stems</b>. Fry stirring a few minutes, depending 
    on how much lead the stems need over the leaves for your chosen 
    choy.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Choy Leaves</b> until coated with oil and mostly wilted, 
    then stir the <b>Sauce Mix</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and simmer covered stirring occasionally for 
    about 4 minutes or until the stems are crisp tender.</li>
  <li>Stir up the <b>Cornstarch</b> and stir it in for a minute or two.
    </li>
  <li>Distribute  <b>Noodles</b> over the top and stir them in very 
    quickly until reasonably well distributed. Give dried noodles a 
    little more time than fresh.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for Fresh Noodles. Wide noodles 
  are good here. The photo example was made with fresh precut 
  B&aacute;nh Pho T&uacute;&oacute;i, and they were well behaved. Using 
  fresh noodles, spread them out and keep them fluffed up so they don't 
  stick together. If using dried noodles, use half the weight and soak 
  in warm water for 45 minutes to an hour. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Choy:</h3> &nbsp; Just about any Choy can be used, including 
  Gai-lan (Chinese Broccoli). The photo example was made with Yu Choy. 
  For details see the Asian section of our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip 
  &amp; Radish Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as 
  essential to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is available in markets 
  serving a Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Condiments:</h3> &nbsp; Two of the essential Thai 
  table condiments (the third is dry chili flake). We have a recipe for 
  <a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a>. For 
  the Chili Garlic Sauce the ubiquitous Huy Fong brand will do fine. 
  It's not   totally authentic (they don't have red ripe jalapeno 
  chilies in Thailand - yet) but no-one seems to mind the extra 
  flavor.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The best way to reheat any leftovers, is in 
  the oven in a casserole, at about 350&deg;F/175&deg;C. This recipe is 
  derived from our <a href="smm_cowbrocnood1.html"><b>Beef with Broccoli 
  and Rice Noodles</b></a> recipe. Thai sauces are not usually thickened 
  with corn starch, but the Thais consider all noodle dishes to be 
  "Chinese", so thickened sauces are acceptable. Noodle dishes are also 
  the only dishes eaten with chopsticks in Thailand. Everything else is 
  eaten with fork and spoon.</li>
