This is an excellent stuffed vegetable dish, meaty and easy to make. It 
is usually served with rice and a dip, often a tomato based dip such as 
<a href="sjm_npong1.html"><b>Nam Prik Ong</b></a>. Other dips will 
work. See <a href="smm_pigcps1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for serving hints.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min with hand chopped pork)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>CHILIS</b> in warm water for about 5 minutes. See how they 
    like to lie, and cut a slit down the top side for almost the full
    length. Carefully remove core and seeds.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> very fine. If using machinery, do not chop to 
    a paste.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in cool water for about 15 minutes. You 
    should end up with 1 cup drained. Stretch them out on your cutting 
    board and cut into about 2 inch lengths.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Stuffing items</b> until well distributed. Stir in 
    all <b>Seasonings Items</b> until well distributed.</li>
  <li>Let stand for about 5 minutes to firm up a little.</li>
  <li>Stuff each <b>Chili</b> with <b>Stuffing mix</b>. Use kitchen 
    shears to cut off bean threads that are sticking out.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Line your steamer basket with <b>Banana Leaf</b>. Arrange the 
    stuffed <b>Chilis</b> on it so they don't quite touch (see 
    <a href="smm_pigcps1x.html"><b>Photos</b></a> for my rig 
    (there's a grate under the banana leaf).</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Water</b> into the steamer pan to about 1 inch 
    below the bottom of the basket. Place the basket over it and 
    cover. Bring to a light boil and steam the chilis until done, 20 
    to 30 minutes depending on size. Check that you don't run out of 
    water.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Chilis</b> from the steamer. Cut in 1 inch to 1-1/2 
    inch lengths, depending on size. Arrange on a serving tray and 
    serve with rice and dipping sauce of your choice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chili, Yellow-Green:</h3> &nbsp; In Laos chilis 
  called <i>Mak Pet Nyai</i> (Thai Prik Yuak) are used. These are less 
  than 6 inches long. The nearest available here in Southern California 
  are Sweet Hungarian peppers, a little more capacious, but similar. Next 
  are Armenian / Turkish chilis, which tend to be wider and hold more. 
  The photo example is made with 7 inch Anaheim chilis, which hold a lot 
  more and have thicker walls - not "authentic", but they work very 
  well, and are less work than smaller chilis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Tai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; Don't confuse these with rice noodles, 
  which look the same dried but behave very differently cooked. For 
  details see our  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html"><b>Asian 
  Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chicken Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This soup stock powder is much used 
  in Southeast Asian cuisines today, both to make a quick stock and as 
  a seasoning. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html">
  <b>Chicken Powder</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Banana Leaf:</h3> &nbsp;  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bn_leafz.html"><b>Banana Leaf</b></a> page. If you 
  don't have Banana Leaf on hand, use Corn Husks or Parchment Paper - or 
  even aluminum foil.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; One 7 inch Anaheim per person or two or three 
  smaller chilis, depending on size. Served with rice and a dip. I serve 
  with a fork (salad or dinner fork) which makes it easy to break up and 
  dip the stuffing, which is firm enough to dip with a fork. The side of 
  the fork makes it easy to scrape the flesh off the chili skins too.</li>
