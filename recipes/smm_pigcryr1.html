A popular Thai country curry. It's usually made with Pork, but Beef is 
also be used The two are handled a little differently, so we have a 
separate recipe for <a href="smm_cowcryr1.html"><b>Beef Red Curry</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick, and cut into strips about 
    1-1/2 by 3/4 inches, or whatever works with your pork. Unfortunately 
    pigs are not rectangular.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> lengthwise into 6 wedges (if Thai eggplants 
    - see <a href="smm_pigcryr1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> for others). Keep eggplants in 
    cold water acidulated with some Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until 
    needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 1 to 1-1/2 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> thin and cut into pieces about 1 inch 
    long by about 1/2 inch wide.</li> 
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b>. Cut in half lengthwise, remove seeds and cut 
    crosswise into strips about 1/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and start soaking in cold water 
    (this is so they stay green longer in the curry).</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Broth items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate 
    heat and stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> until it is well distributed and 
    aromatic, but no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Pork</b> and stir fry a few minutes until all 
    raw color is gone, any exuded liquid has evaporated, and it is well 
    coated with the curry paste.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth mix</b> and <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    then cover and simmer until Pork is tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant</b> and <b>Long Beans</b>. Bring back to a 
    boil and continue to simmer until just tender but not mushy, about 
    12 minutes for Thai eggplants, somewhat less for others.</li> 
  <li>Drain <b>Basil Leaves</b>. If you wish, separate some out to use 
    as Garnish, and cut the rest into wide shreds.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Red Chili</b> for just a minute, 
    then turn off heat and stir in <b>Basil Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. In Thailand 
    they probably spoon it over the rice, but I serve it beside the rice 
    in a deep plate, with a good amount of the broth, to be mixed as 
    desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all excess 
  fat removed. Most cuts can be used, but I usually use leg as it is 
  inexpensive and high in flavor. Loin is more tender but has the 
  least flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; These are green and white and golf 
  ball size. They cook significantly differently from other eggplants 
  and are well worth searching out. If you don't have them, use 
  Indian eggplants which are purple and egg size, so cut them into 
  quarters lengthwise, cut the wedges in half crosswise (8 pieces), and 
  cook just a bit less. Lacking even those, use Japanese or Italian 
  eggplants split in quarters lengthwise and cut crosswise about 3/4 
  inch thick. Cook those even less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplant Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely 
  grown in California and available in most markets that serve a 
  Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page. Regular 
  green beans have a much different flavor, but can be used if cooking 
  time is shorter.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably buy these in vacuum pack 
  bags. This avoids the par boiling step recommended to remove the tinny 
  flavor of canned Bamboo Shoots.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Prik Chee Fah, 
  but they aren't much available in North America. Around here everyone 
  uses red ripe Fresno chilis, but Holland Red would also work. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis 
  Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; In Asian cooking there is no requirement for 
  the stock to match the meat, so beef, pork or chicken stock can be 
  used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essentials of Thai 
  cooking, and is available commercially (with a lot 
  of variation between brands). It is better made at home. The amount 
  in this recipe is scaled for our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>, recipe, which is fairly hot. 2 T is about 
  the minimum to make this curry "satisfyingly hot" by Southern 
  California standards, but it would be woefully mild by Thai standards. 
  Use your own best judgement, but only wimps from the Frozen North 
  would go as low as 1 T. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: "Red Curry Sauce" sold by 
  yuppie food outlets is unsuitable for real Thai recipes.</li>
