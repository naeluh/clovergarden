  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Hard boil <b>EGGS</b> by best method for 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a>. Medium size 
    eggs are good for this dish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min - exclusive of boiling and peeling eggs)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> to remove bone chips and dry thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Peel just the hardest outside leaves from the <b>LEMON GRASS</b>. 
    Use the bottom 9 inches, cut crosswise into three pieces and lightly 
    bruised with your kitchen mallet.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> in half crosswise and bruise lightly.Slice 
    <b>GINGER</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and crush 
    lightly.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Aromatics items</b> together.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6"> 
  <li>Make Caramel - see <a href="smm_pigfeet1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>. In a small 
    saucepan place <b>Sugar</b> and <b>Water</b>. Over very moderate 
    heat, stir until sugar dries out into a crust, then let it melt until 
    the color of dark tea. Remove from heat. Carefully stir 1 cup of the 
    <b>Stock</b> into the sauce pan. The caramel will seize hard, but 
    set it back on the moderate heat and stir until it has dissolved.</li>
  <li>Into a suitable heavy bottomed pot, pour <b>Caramel mix</b>, the 
    remaining <b>Sauce items</b>, the <b>Pig's Feet</b> and the 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer covered until 
    until the meat is quite tender. about 2-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li>Take off heat and carefully skim off fat from the surface - or see 
    <a href="smm_pigfeet1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> for my method.</li>
  <li>Mix in the <b>Boiled Eggs</b>. Simmer another 10 minutes uncovered, 
    turning the eggs often for even color.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, with a good amount of the broth, and see 
    <a href="smm_pigfeet1.html#08"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely available in ethnic 
  markets here in Southern California (except Jewish and Islamic of 
  course). They are commonly already cut into pieces and 
  shrink wrapped in foam trays. They should be cut in half lengthwise, 
  then two cuts crosswise (three makes the pieces too small). If you find 
  them whole, have the butcher saw them for you. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Two dried red Thai chilis will make this 
  dish very moderately hot by Southern California standards. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Caramel:</h3> &nbsp; The caramel would never be made as part of 
  the recipe in Cambodia or Vietnam - it's a kitchen staple, made in 
  larger batches (see our recipe 
  <a href="siv_caramel1.html"><b>Caramel Sauce</b></a>). If you have 
  it, just use 2 Tablespoons of it instead of making it here.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a light Pork Stock, but if you 
  don't have that, Chicken Stock or plain Water can be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tuk Trey:</h3> &nbsp; This is an indispensable Cambodian 
  condiment and ingredient, nearly identical to Vietnamese Nuoc Cham. 
  It is easy to make by our recipe 
  <a href="sjf_tuktrey1.html"><b>Tuk Trey</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was finished as above.  
  The way I do it makes for a nicer looking finish. I strain out the 
  solids, then carefully remove the pig's feet (and a few of the nicer 
  solids to use as a sort of garnish). I discard the remaining solids 
  and defat the broth thoroughly using my gravy separator. Then 
  the Broth, Pig's Feet and Eggs go in. The pot is brought back to a 
  boil and simmered for 10 minutes as above. Actually, I've found the 
  eggs don't really color much in 10 minutes.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; Serve with plenty of French Bread or Jasmine 
  Rice to sop up the delicious broth. French Bread? Cambodia was part 
  of French Indochina, so bread, though not used with Vietnamese 
  abandon, is not unknown in Cambodia. Also plenty of beer - you can't 
  have a properly barbaric feast without beer!</li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; There is no way to eat this dish except 
  with the fingers - those of one hand holding a chunk of pig foot to 
  bite off pieces, those of the other hand removing bones from the mouth 
  and tossing them in the bone bowl - and it's a bit sticky. Supply piles 
  of paper napkins, a bone bowl, and if possible, finger bowls. There 
  should be an easily available place to wash hands and mouth. Clearly 
  this is a "guy dish", but, in this day and age, with girls now even 
  allowed to eat <a href="tmm_khash1.html"><b>Kash</b></a> in 
  Armenia, they are welcome to the feast if they please.</li>
