Thais liked their food "spicy" even before the Portuguese brought chili 
peppers from the New World. With this recipe you can enjoy the pre-chili 
style, but see <a href="smm_piggarlpep1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> crosswise into 1/8 inch thick medallions about 1 by 
     1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, chop fine and grind together with 
    <b>Peppercorns</b> (see <a href="smm_piggarlpep1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over medium heat and stir in 
    <b>Garlic mix</b>. Fry stirring vigorously and scraping the bottom of 
    the pan - until it starts to stick too hard to scrape up. Then stir 
    in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring vigorously until all the raw color 
    is gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Turn the heat 
    down and continue to cook stirring for a minute or so, then stir in 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b> and cook stirring for another 3 minutes. Stir in 
    some water if it seems too dry.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; if you don't have this just fake 
  it up with 2 parts dark soy sauce, 1 part molasses. That's pretty much 
  what it is anyway.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3>  &nbsp; If you don't have it use demerara or 
  turbinado sugar - not as tasty but it will work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Garlic:</h3> &nbsp; Properly it is smashed to a pulp along with 
  the peppercorns in a large stone mortar - but today a spice grinder 
  and mini-prep food processor can be used. The mortar and pestle do 
  a great job, but pounding that long with a 3 pound pestle is 
  hard on the shoulder.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This is powerful stuff so you're going to 
  want to serve it with <u>lots</u> of Jasmine rice and perhaps a 
  cooling cucumber salad on the side.<li>
