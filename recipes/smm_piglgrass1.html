Pork is not as much served Singapore restaurants as it is in China and 
Southeast Asia, because of the substantial Muslim population, but you 
can't expect the Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese to give up their favorite 
beast.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cutting with the grain, slice <b>PORK</b> into narrow strips about 
    1/8 inch by 1/4 inch by 2 inches or whatever.</li>
  <li>Peel tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. Smash the big end with a kitchen mallet and slice the 
    bottom 4 inches as thin as you can. Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and 
    <B>SHALLOTS</b> and chop fine. Smash all to a paste in mortar (best) 
    or mini-prep processor (easiest). Start with just the Lemon Grass, 
    then add Shallots and Garlic.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Pepper</b> to <b>Lemon Grass mix</b>, 
    then massage it thoroughly into <b>Pork</b>. Marinate for 30 minutes 
    or more at room temperature or at least 1-1/2 hours in the 
    refrigerator.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CELERY</b> lengthwise into narrow strips, then cut crosswise 
    into 1/4 inch dice (or longer if you like). Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in 
    half lengthwise if large or if "unpeeled". Seed <b>CHILIS</b> and cut 
    into thin shreds. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> into very thin rounds. Mix 
    all.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Pork</b> stirring over high heat until it loses all it's raw 
    color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Celery mix</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil, cover 
    and simmer another 2 minutes. The celery should be cooked but 
    still quite crunchy.</li>
  <li> Serve immediately with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; Stalks vary widely in size, so use what 
  you need to make 3 Tablespoons chopped fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Straw Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are easily available in cans, 
  about 7-1/2 ounces drained per can. If you don't have them, you can 
  use white mushrooms. Just fry them in a little oil until they just 
  start to exude water, then set them aside. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_strawz.html"><b>Straw Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red or similar will do fine, or just one small red Anaheim. Two 
  Fresnos, seeded but with the membranes still in, make this dish just 
  a little spicy by Southern California standards, Rather mild by Thai 
  standards, but perhaps a bit hot for folks in the Frozen North.For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
