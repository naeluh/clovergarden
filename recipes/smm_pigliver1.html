This Thai take on Liver &amp; Onions is one of my favorite ways to cook 
liver. It's quick and easy too, but should be served immediately when 
done. This can be a main course or a side dish for twice as many servings.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Liver</h3> &nbsp; Livers are available in markets serving 
  Asian, Eastern European, and Latin American communities. The average 
  pork liver weighs just about 1 pound. Cook it right away, organ meats 
  have a short shelf life. Calf liver could be used, but it's 
  a little coarser in texture and flavor. Lamb liver could be used at 
  a higher cost.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Green Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia these would be 
  fresh from the pepper vine. Here the best we can get is brined in a 
  jar. Lacking those soak 2 t dried green peppercorns for 20 minutes - 
  not as aromatic but at least something. Lacking even those use 1/4 t 
  freshly ground black pepper as they would in China. &nbsp; 
  <u>Note:</u> brined green peppercorns need to be drained and frozen 
  with water to cover immediately or they turn black. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sp_pepperz.html"><b>Peppercorns</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
