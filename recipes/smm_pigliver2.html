  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK LIVER</b> thin, less than 1/4 inch. Slicing is 
    easier if you leave it in the freezer compartment until stiff 
    but not frozen.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>RED DATES</b> and <b>WOLFBERRIES</b> in warm water for 15 
    minutes, then drain. Split Dates open lengthwise to remove 
    seeds and mix back with Wolfberries.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 3 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> lengthwise into thick slices, then cut the slices 
    in half crosswise. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (7 minutes)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> (not too hot if using gingelly oil), Stir in the 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until onion slices are just 
    translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Red Date mix</b> for about a minute, then <b>Pork Liver</b> 
    and <b>1/2 the Scallions</b> (the rest are for garnish). Stir to mix, 
    then stir in <b>Rice Wine</b> and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Cook over fairly 
    high heat until sauce comes to a boil, then stir in <b>Cornstarch 
    mix</b> until sauce starts to thicken - about 1 minute.</li> 
  <li>Serve immediately, garnishd with remaining <b>Scallions</b> and with 
    plenty of steamed jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Liver</h3> is available in markets serving Asian, Latino, 
  and Eastern European communities. Pork livers weigh between 12 ounces
  and 1 pound. Cook it right away, organ meats have a short shelf life.
  Lamb liver could also be used, at a higher cost.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Dates</h3> are actually dried jujubies, not dates, and are 
  widely available in markets serving Chinese or Korean communities. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bt_jujuz.html"><b>Jujubes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Wolfberries</h3> are available at most well stocked Asian 
  markets, often in the medicianl herbs section labeled "Fructus Lycii". 
  For details see our  <a href="../ingred/ns_wolfbz.html">
  <b>Wolfberries</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Gingelly Oil</h3> is untoasted sesame seed oil, clear light 
  yellow in color - not to be confused with dark Asian sesame oil. 
  It is commonly used in Southern India and Southeast Asia. If you don't 
  have it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin).</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Rice Wine:</b> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, not 
  that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, use a 
  Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
