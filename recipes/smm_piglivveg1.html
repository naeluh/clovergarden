A favorite - quick and easy with complimentary textures and flavors - 
and <u>no onions</u>. Heresy! Very short cooking times make for 
crisp-tender beans and liver that's just firm, so don't exceed them.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="02"><b>Pork Livers</b> can be found in any respectable Asian 
  or Latino market. They weigh between 1 and 1-3/4 pound each. Lamb liver 
  could also be used, at a highter cost.</li>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are now common in North America and 
  can be found in markets serving an East or Southeast Asian community. 
  If you can't get them, regular round green beans can be used but will 
  be less crunchy and with a lighter, less sweet flavor. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Bean</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red or similar will do fine in place of Thai large red chilis. Control 
  the heat by how thoroughly you scrape out the seeds and membranes. 
  This dish should have a significant chili bite, but use your own 
  judgement. For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
