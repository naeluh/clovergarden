A light, simple and delicious stir fry, suitable for informal and 
weekday dinners. Unlike squash, luffa softens, but holds its shape 
rather than getting mushy.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch thick, then into strips about 1/2 
    inch wide by 1 inch long.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>LUFFA</b>. Quarter lengthwise and cut into slices 1/4 to 3/8 
    inch thick.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and slice thin diagonally.</li>  
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOT</b> in half lengthwise and slice fine crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in warm water until softened. 
    Drain, set on cutting board and make about 3 cuts through the 
    pile and 3 cuts at right angles for more manageable lengths.</li>
  </ol>  
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless, with all excess fat removed.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Luffa:</h3> &nbsp; [Oyong (Indonesia); Sing Qua (China)] &nbsp; 
  This may be angled luffa, sold around here as "Chinese Okra" or smooth 
  luffa (if you can get it). The pattern recipe used an angled luffa, 
  but I prefer smooth luffa, which is easier to work with. I get it at 
  the Asian markets here in Los Angeles. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_luffaz.html"><b>Luffa</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork Stock work fine. You could also 
  use plain Water, as the fish sauce will give it some complexity.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Commentary:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was by a lady who 
  recognized the taste of luffa from her childhood, and called her 
  Indonesian mother for the recipe. Some may wonder about a  pork recipe 
  from a predominantly Muslim country, with the largest Muslim population 
  in the world. There are, however, a number of large non-Muslim ethnic 
  enclaves, including the island  of Bali, where pork is very much on 
  the menu. There are also enclaves where Islam is blended with 
  indigenous religions, where pork may also be eaten.</li>
