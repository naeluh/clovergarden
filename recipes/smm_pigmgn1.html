Mustard Greens are well known in Thailand, but I could find only soup 
recipes for this mix, so I call this recipe Thai / California. 
Ingredients and methods are Thai, see <a href="smm_pigmgn1.html#07">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> about 1/8 inch and cut into strips 1/2 inch wide 
    and up to 2 inches long. Unlike beef pork can be cut with the grain 
    when cut thin.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Pork</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for at least 1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick. If using fresh 
    Shiitakes, after slicing soak in hot water about 20 minutes, then 
    wring them out. This greatly improves their texture.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>MUSTARD GREENS</b> and cut or tear the Leaves however 
    you like. Slice Stems about 1/2 inch at thick ends and longer as 
    they thin. Sher Li Hon stems do not need to be held separate unless 
    they are quite large, but I usually do anyway.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very 
   thin. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Garlic mix</b> for about 30 seconds, then stir in <b>Pork</b>. 
    Fry stirring over high flame until it has completely lost its raw 
    color. The cornstarch will start to stick to the pan, be careful it 
    does not burn. Reddish is OK, but if it's turning chocolate, go on 
    to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mustard Stems</b> (if separate) and <b>Mushrooms</b>. 
    Fry stirring about 2 minutes, then stir in <b>Leaves</b> until 
    coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Scrape fond stuck 
    to the pan into the sauce. Simmer covered, turning now and then, 
    until Mustard stems are crisp tender, 3 to 5 minutes depending 
    on size and variety.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat trimmed away. Just about any cut can be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute, it's a beer. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mustard Greens:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe works best with Sher Li Hon 
  or Small Gai Choy, which are relatively mild as mustard greens go. I 
  have also successfully used Long/Texas Mustard greens. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#amust"><b>Asian Greens</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Most fresh mushrooms can be used. I usually 
  use the small King Oyster Mushrooms now easily available around here. 
  If you use fresh Shiitakes, slice them and soak them in hot water for 
  20 minutes - then wring them out. This greatly improves their texture. 
  For details, see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Los Angeles we have 
  a Thai restaurant every half mile or so on our larger streets. Thai 
  food is practically a native cuisine here, so I do not hesitate to 
  do a little improvising to match ingredients on hand, as they do in 
  Thailand. This recipe is in the Thai/Chinese style, quite common in 
  Thailand. Cornstarch in the marinade, rice wine and oyster sauce are 
  Chinese elements, while the fish sauce, chilis, lime juice, and more 
  liquid sauce are very Thai.</li>
