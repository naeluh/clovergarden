This recipe is Thai in the Chinese style, a very common format in 
Thailand. I call it Thai / California because I did not find a Thai 
recipe that was exactly what I wanted, see <a href="smm_pigmspin1.html#05">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick. If using fresh 
    Shitakes, after slicing soak in hot water about 20  minutes, then 
    wring them out. This greatly improves their texture.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> into medallions about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>SPINACH</b> and shake off excess water. Break tendrils into 
    convenient lengths, separating large leaves and tearing really large 
    ones into pieces. Discard stems larger than 1/4 inch diameter and 
    any that seem fibrous.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>GARLIC</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Core <b>CHILIS</b> and slice thin.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Stock</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Oyster 
  Sauce</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Garlic</b> until it is just starts to color. Stir in 
    <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring for a couple of minutes, then stir in 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> and continue to fry stirring until the raw color 
    is completely gone and pork is cooked through.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach</b> just until coated with oil, then stir in 
    <b>Stock mix</b>. Cook tumbling gently over moderate heat until Spinach 
    is a uniform cooked color. Do not overcook or it will become slimy. 
    Near the end of cooking stir in <b>Chilis</b>.</li> 
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Most fresh mushrooms can be used. I 
  usually use the small King Oyster Mushrooms now easily available 
  around here. If you use fresh Shiitakes, slice them and soak them in 
  hot water for 20 minutes - then wring them out. This greatly improves 
  their texture. The photo example is made with fresh Shiitakes For 
  details, see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"> <b>Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; (Mong Toi, Saan Choy) This tropical 
  vine, related to cactus and purslane, is used similarly to how regular 
  spinach is used in cooler regions. It is usually labeled Mong Toi in 
  Southern California. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses Red Fresnos, but other 
  medium hot chilis like Holland Red will do fine, For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Los Angeles we have a Thai restaurant 
  every half mile or so on our larger streets. Thai food is practically 
  a native cuisine here, so I do not hesitate to do a little improvising 
  to match ingredients on hand, as they do in Thailand. This recipe is 
  in the Thai/Chinese style. Cornstarch in the marinade, rice wine and 
  oyster sauce are Chinese elements commonly used in Thailand, while 
  the fish sauce, chilis, and more liquid sauce are very Thai.</li>
