This delicious dish has an almost smoky flavor, worthy of being widely 
adopted - but Water Spinach is illegal in many US states. It's widely 
available in California, grown by licensed farms.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> into chunks about 1/2 inch thick and 3/4 inches 
    square.</li>
  <li>Pinch Leaves from  <b>ONG CHOY</b> stems, leaving the leaf stems 
    attached to the main stems. Because the leaves are usually very long 
    and prone to tangle, I plsace the whole pile on my cutting board and 
    make one cut through the pile, then another at right angles.</li>
  <li>Discard any stem pieces more than 1/4 inch 
    diameter and cut all stems, including leaf stems, into lengths of 
    about 1-1/2 inch. Keep separate from the leaves.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>ONION</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b></li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> fairly hot in a wok (you'll need the space) and stir in 
    <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry stirring until just translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until pork loses its raw color and 
    starts to brown, being careful not to burn the Garlic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock mix</b>, bring to a boil and simmer covered 
    until Pork is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Vinegar</b>. Simmer 5 minutes without stirring.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ong Choy Stems</b> and bring back to a simmer. Simmer 
    covered, stirring occasionally until Ong Choy stems are tender 
    (about 4 minutes - the larger ones should remain a bit crisp).</li>
  <li>Scatter 1/3 of <b>Ong Choy Leaves</b> over the stew and stir in. 
    Repeat with the other 2/3. Bring back to a simmer for about 1 
    minute.</li> 
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Water Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; In California this vegetable can be 
  found in markets serving Southeast Asian communities, generally sold 
  as "Ong Choy". It's sold in bundles weighing between 1 and 2 pounds, 
  which can be trasported without a permit. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The Philippines are the center for vinegar 
  cuisine so they have many fine varieties of cane, palm, and coconut 
  vinegars. My favorite is Datu Puti brand Sukang Iloco Native Vinegar, 
  a dark, natural sugar cane vinegar. If you don't have Philippine, use 
  a good rice vinegar. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html"><b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Prep Time</h3> &nbsp; This is mostly for dealing with the the 
  leaves and stems of the water spinach. It can be as much as 45 minutes 
  for a difficult bunch.</li>
