"Pumpkin" in most of the world means a hard round squash, usually green -  
not our orange Halloween pumpkin, which is watery and lacks flavor.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut a 1 pound wedge out of your <b>KABOCHA</b>. Cut this wedge 
    into wedges about 1-1/4 inch wide at the wide end (this makes it 
    easy to peel). Peel thinly (greenish on the outside is fine). 
    Cut the wedges into segments about 1-1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise 
    very thin, then chop fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a saucepan (about 3 quarts) and fry <b>Garlic 
    mix</b> until Garlic is just light golden. When the Garlic has 
    about stopped sizzling, stir in <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Kabocha</b> to the pot along with 4 Cups <b>Water</b>.
    Bring to a boil and simmer until Kabocha is nearly tender (just a 
    few minutes). Take off the heat and let Kabocha cool in the cooking 
    water (don't discard water).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (35 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Trim <b>PORK</b> of any membranes, but leave a little fat. Cut into 
    about 1 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Pork</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for at least 1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise 
    very thin, then chop fine. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> crosswise very thin. \
    Mix all.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>Garnishes</b> - see <a href="smm_pigpmp1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Drain <b>Pumpkin</b>, retaining all the cooking water.</li>
  <li>In a 5 quart saut&eacute; pan, wok or other suitable pan, 
    heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until 
    Onions are translucent, then stir in <b>Garlic mix</b>. Continue 
    to fry stirring until Onions threaten to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> until well coated with the Oil and Onions. 
    Stir in 3 cups of the <b>Pumpkin Water</b>. Bring to a boil, then 
    cover and simmer slowly until Pork is tender, about 1-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pumpkin</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 1/2 cup more 
    <b>Pumpkin Water</b>. Simmer uncovered until the stew thickens a 
    bit, it should not be soupy.</li>
  <li>If you have time, let the stew mature for 20 minutes or more, then 
    reheat for serving.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with garnishes (see <a href="smm_pigpmp1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>) and 
    plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kabocha Squash:</h3> &nbsp; When Asian recipes call for "Pumpkin", 
  this is what they actually mean. This fine winter squash is widely 
  available in North America now, even in non-Asian produce markets. 
  For details see   our <a href="../ingred/sq_kabochz.html"><b>Kabocha 
  Squash</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with just a little fat. 
  Pork Shoulder is good, but other cuts could also be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Two of these gives this recipe just a 
  little heat. Burmese don't go for the high heat the Thai prefer.
  for details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp;  Burmese curry and stew recipes call for more 
  oil than Westerners may be comfortable with. I have cut the pattern 
  recipe's oil from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup, which is plenty. Peanut oil would 
  be used in Burma, but I use Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) which is fairly 
  neutral and works fine.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
   <h3>Garnishes:</h3> &nbsp; For a formal service, set out separate 
   bowls with 1/2 cup each of <b>Mint Leaves</b> and small <b>Cilantro 
   Sprigs</b> to be added according to individual taste. For buffet 
   service, chop the leaves and sprigs coarse (1/4 cup each) and mix 
   them in just before serving. In either case, set out a dish with 
   <b>Lime Wedges</b>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is based on practice in 
  a Burmese owned and staffed restaurant in Oakland, California. It does, 
  however, call for 1 teaspoon Madras Curry Powder, which my other 
  Burmese cookbooks assure me would <u>not</u> be used in Burma, so I 
  have left it out. While Peanut Oil would be used in Burma, the cookbook 
  writers call for Canola Oil in all recipes. Canola is a fiercely 
  promoted oil that I do not recommend (see our 
  <a href="../ingred/oi_canolz.html"><b>Canola Oil</b></a> page).</li>
