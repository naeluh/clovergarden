A light, easy, and very tasty curry. It has some chili bite (depending 
on your red curry paste), but not overwhelming. It could also be made 
with Chicken, which would be <i>Phat Phet Kai</i>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses Red Fresnos, but 
  Holland Red or other medium hot chilis can be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Basil</h3> &nbsp; This should be Thai purple Basil (it's just the 
  stems that are purple), not the light green Lemon Basil which is for 
  salads. If you don't have Thai, regular purple or Italian basil are 
  reasonable substitutes.  For details on types of basil see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mt_basil.html"><b>Basil Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the essential Thai 
  curry pastes . Different brands and recipes vary, but the amount in 
  this recipe is scaled for our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a> which is fairly hot. "Thai Red Curry 
  Sauce" is not suitable.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Green Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; Thai recipes presume these are 
  fresh off the vine, which is not possible in North America. They are 
  available in jars packed in brine in some markets serving a Southeast 
  Asian community. Once the jar is opened they turn black very 
  quickly, so I immediately freeze them in water to keep them from 
  suffering freezer burn. If you don't have these, grind about 1 T of 
  dried green pepper or 1/2 T of black peppercorns. 	For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sp_pepperz.html"><b>Peppercorns</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Do they actually have Zucchini in Thailand? 
  Is there anywhere they don't have zucchini? This Italian squash was 
  first popularized in Los Angeles restaurants, and spread west and east, 
  even all the way back to Italy.</li>
