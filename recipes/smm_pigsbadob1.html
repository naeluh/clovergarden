A rich, complex and mildly tart dish from the Philippines, with 
contrasting flavors and textures. It's a little more complex than many 
Philippine adobos, but still very easy to make.

<p>This recipe serves four alone with rice, and will serve 6 or 7 Asian 
style with several other dishes.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Peel and devein <b>SHRIMP</b>. Cut in half if very large.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BAMBOO SHOOTS</b> about 1/8 inch thick and 1-1/2 by 1/2 
    inch or whatever you can work out.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Broth items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a spacious saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Onion Mix</b> stirring until lightly browned, scraping up the 
    fond so the garlic doesn't stick. Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry 
    stirring until lightly browned, being careful the fond adhering to 
    the pan doesn't get too dark.</li>
  <li>At this point, if you've chopped your own pork, you should be ready 
    to go, but if you used commercial ground pork you probably have excess 
    fat and need to pour most of it off.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth mix</b> and <b>Bamboo Shoots</b>. Bring to a boil 
    and simmer uncovered for about 3 minutes, scraping up the fond.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and simmer until sauce is reduced by about 
    half, about 15 minutes, stirring in <b>Shrimp</b> for the last 8 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve with steamed Jasmine rice.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless and all excess 
  fat trimmed. Chopped fine is best, but ground will work.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is drained weight. Best are fresh 
  from a tub, or in the new plastic vacuum bags. Canned can be used, but 
  par boil them a few minutes to remove some of the canned flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This should be one of the fine vinegars 
  available from Philippine markets. The photo specimen was made with 
  Coconut Vinegar, but Palm or Cane vinegar could also be used. 
  Lacking the real thing, use white wine vinegar, or if lacking that, 
  distilled white vinegar - not as flavorful and a bit harsher so use a 
  touch less. For details see our
