A popular meaty dish with a bit of chili bite. It is also made with 
Chicken (<i>Phat Khi Mao Kai</i>). I serve with 
<a href="sjv_chilivinegar1.html"><b>Chili Vinegar Sauce</b></a> on the 
side so it can be spiced up a bit more.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cilantro Roots:</h3> &nbsp; These are hard to get even here in 
  Los Angeles. Even the farmer's markets rarely have them, so we often 
  have to use cilantro stems (no leaves) instead.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These are pretty hot, but small. If you 
  don't have them substitute 2 or 3 (your best judgement) Serranos, which 
  are not quite as hot but a lot larger. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Basil</h3> &nbsp; This should be Thai purple Basil (it's just 
  the stems that are purple), not the light green Lemon Basil which is 
  for salads. If you don't have Thai, regular purple or Italian Basils 
  are reasonable substitutes.  For details on types of basil see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mt_basil.html"><b>Basil Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
