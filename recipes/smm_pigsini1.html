Don't let the "sour" put you off, it's very mildly sour. Sinigang na 
Baboy is a very popular dish in the Philippines, made with countless 
minor variations, mostly in selection of vegetables (see 
<a href="smm_pigsini1.html#08"><b>Comments</b></a>).

<p>Much of the prep time is peeling taro, so Yam or Potatoes would be 
much quicker.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>PORK</b> of any excess fat and cut into 3/4 to 1 inch 
    cubes.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> as needed (see 
    <a href="smm_pigsini1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li> 
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>GREENS</b> as appropriate, keeping stems separate if 
    they will take much longer to cook than the leafy part.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TARO ROOTS</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into about 2 inch lengths. Add to Taro.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>DAIKON</b> 1/2 inch thick and cut into chunks similar 
    to the other ingredients. Add to Taro.</li>
  <li>Split <b>CHILI</b> lengthwise. Add to Taro.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Place <b>Pork</b> in a 4 quart sauce pan with water to cover well. 
    Bring to a boil for 1 minute, then pour out into a clean sink. Rinse 
    away all crud and return to the cleaned pan.</li>
  <li>Add 6 cups <b>Water</b> to the pan and bring to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Onion</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, Tamarind and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to 
    a boil, then simmer covered until the pork is nearly tender, about 
    40 min.</li>
  <li>If your pork has produced too much fat, strain out the solids and 
    remove the fat using your gravy separator. Return liquid and solids 
    to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Taro Root mix</b>. Bring up to a simmer, cover and 
    simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stems</b> (if separate from the greens). Bring back 
    to a boil and simmer about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Leaves</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>. Bring back to a 
    boil and simmer another 3 minutes or until tender.</li>
  <li>Serve hot accompanie by steamed Jasmine rice - see 
    <a href="smm_pigsini1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork</h3> &nbsp; This recipe uses boneless pork to be easiest to 
  serve at buffet. Some recipes call for Spare Ribs, others use boneless 
  Country Style Ribs, and some call for a mix of some form of pork 
  combined with Pork Belly. If you use a bone-in cut, increase weight 
  to 1-1/2 pounds.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp;  Weight is for block form. Soak 1/2 hour 
  or more in 1-1/2 cups hot water. After straining you will have about 1 
  cup of liquid. This amount is roughly equivalent to 5 T of jarred 
  concentrate. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html">
  <b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Most popular are Mustard Greens (Small Gai 
  Choy) and Water Spinach (Ong Choy, Kangkong), but other Asian greens 
  will also work. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip and 
  Radish Greens</b></a> page and our <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html">
  <b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Taro Root:</h3> &nbsp; These are widely available in North America. 
  Use the regular small ones for this recipe. Yams (real ones) also work 
  well. Waxy potatoes like White Rose can be used as a substitute, but 
  cooking time will be longer and the taste and texture will be 
  different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_taroz.html"><b>Taro / Colocasia</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are now widely available in North 
  America, and any market serving a Southeast Asian community should 
  have them. Green Beans are an imperfect substitute because their 
  flavor is different and they don't stand up to cooking as well. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3>> &nbsp; For cooking, select smallish Daikons. 
  Large ones will be fibrous, not noticed raw, but annoying when cooked.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Philippine or Chinese eggplant is a very 
  common vegetable in this stew, sometimes replacing the Daikon, other 
  times replacing the Taro, or whatever. 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_mglory.html"><b>Yams</b></a> (real ones, purple 
  or white, not those orange things) may replace the Taro. A modest 
  amount of red Bell Pepper is often added, and sometimes a chili, or 
  often not.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp;  In Asia, a liquidy stew like this would be 
  spooned over rice. I much prefer a full bowl of the stew and add a 
  generous scoop of rice into it, a little off to the side to be mixed 
  in as I please.</li>
