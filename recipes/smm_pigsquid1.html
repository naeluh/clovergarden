Delicious pork and squid in its own tangy tasty sauce. It's not as pungent as 
many Philippine recipes (no shrimp pastes or fermented fish) and goes very 
well with Jasmine rice.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>SQUID</b> and cut into pieces about 1 inch square if large 
    squid, larger pieces if small squid (they'll roll up). For complete 
    instructions see my page 
    <a href="../ingred/seasquidl.html"><b>Cleaning, Cutting & Cooking 
    Large Squid</b></a> and <a href="smm_pigsquid1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> below.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into 1 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>Crush, slice  and chop <b>GARLIC</b> small.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice medium crosswise.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold water, 
    peel and cut into medium dice.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/8 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Put <b>Pork</b> in a saucepan and add <b>Water</b> to just cover. 
    Bring to a boil, then simmer slowly for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse 
    pork, then dry as completely as practical.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Lard</b> or <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Pork</b> cubes stirring until browned on all sides. This will 
    take only about 5 minutes. Remove pork leaving lard or oil in the pan.
    </li>
  <li>In the remaining oil fry <b>Garlic</b> until the first hint of color, 
    then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Fry stirring until onions are translucent, 
    being careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring until well softened, then 
    stir <b>Pork</b> back in and fry stirring about 3 minutes more.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b>, cover and simmer slowly for about 30 
    minutes until pork is becoming tender.</li>
  <li>Check liquid, add water as needed. There should be enough liquid to 
    cook the squid quickly and to make a nice sauce.</li> 
  <li>When ready to serve, not before, turn up the heat so the liquid is 
    boiling and stir in <b>Squid</b>. Cook stirring for less than 2 minutes 
    (large squid) or about 30 seconds (small squid). Take it off the heat 
    and serve with plenty of Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Squid:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for whole uncleaned squid, about 12 
  oz cleaned. I prefer large squid as shown in photo though small squid 
  could be used. If unable to procure fresh squid or not up to 
  cleaning it, frozen calimari steaks could be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; butt, shoulder or similar. Original recipes call 
  for frying pork in its own fat but our American pork is so lean it 
  absorbs fat rather than exuding it. I specify lard for frying but you 
  could use oil if you are still afraid of lard.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Lard is the traditional frying medium through 
  Thailand and much of China, as well as Hungary and Poland. The 
  American Heart Association so villainized it Americans are afraid to 
  use it, but it's not nearly as dangerous as the trans fats they told 
  us to use instead. It has a better health profile than butter, and is 
  now increasingly used by top chefs. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page. If you still 
  don't want to use it, use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), or Avocado oil 
  for richer flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; A natural sugar cane vinegar from the 
  Philippines is preferable (Sukang Iloco), or Palm or Coconut 
  vinegar, but distilled white vinegar can be used if those are not 
  available. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
