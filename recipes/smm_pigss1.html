the sticky, acrid, neon red pork of Chinese American take-out infamy - 
and far more healthy as well.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here everyone uses Red Fresnos, but 
  other chilis can be used. Two Fresnos make this dish quite mild, 
  so add Thai chilis if you wish. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tapioca Starch</h3> &nbsp; This starch, easily available in markets 
  serving a Southeast Asian community, is excellent for adding right at 
  the end of cooking. Potato starch can be substituted with very little
  more cooking, but cornstarch would nead nearly twice as much and have 
  to cook longer at a higher temperature. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/starch.html"><b>Starches, Thickeners &amp; 
  Gels</b></a> page.</li>
