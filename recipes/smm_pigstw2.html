Deliciously indulgent with Pork Belly, as in photo, but also tasty using
Pork Shoulder. It's easy to make and reheats very well.	See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Set <b>BLACK MUSHROOMS</b> soaking in warm water. They need <u>at 
    least</u> 30 minutes. Stem them and cut into quarters.</li>
  <li>IF <b>PORK BELLY</b>, cut into rectangular cubes. In general, length 
    will be the thickness of the belly. One side is about 1 inch (usually the 
    width of a slice, and about 3/4 inch on the other side. If using 
    <b>PORK SHOULDER</b>, cut into pieces of similar size but shorter.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine.  Peel 4 cloves of <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    fine. Mix and pound to a coarse paste in a large mortar - this is a lot 
    less trouble than using a Blender or Mixie, but a mini-prep processor 
    might work OK.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Bean Sauce</b> if it's a whole bean version. Mix all <b>Paste-B 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>Peel 6 cloves <b>GARLIC</b> and leave them whole.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp;  (25 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 quart) or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> 
    over medium flame. Stir in <b>Shallot paste</b> and Cinnamon Stick. 
    Fry stirring until raw smell abates, but no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bean Sauce paste</b> and fry stirring for 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until coated with the paste, 
    then stir in 2/3 cup <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, stirring often 
    for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in quartered <b>Mushrooms</b> and the whole <b>Garlic Cloves</b>. 
    Bring back to a boil, then cover and turn to a simmer until Pork is 
    tender, 1 to 1-1/2 hrs. Stir now and then and adjust liquid as needed 
    to form a sauce of the consistency you prefer.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, along with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. This dish 
    reheats very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Made with Pork Belly, as in the photo example, this 
  dish is richly deliciously, less rich, but still delicious if using Pork 
  Shoulder, especially if some fat is included, or a mix of both. Keep in 
  mind, the <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> has been 
  exposed as fraudulent from the get-go, and probably harmful. The pattern 
  recipe, written in London, calls for Pork Belly "skinned", but here on the 
  Pacific Rim we use it "skin-on" for better flavor and texture.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the regular dried Shiitakes 
  available anywhere with an Asian section. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is a fermented soy bean sauce 
  widely used in Southeast Asia, and available in any decent Asian market. 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html">
  <b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Palm Sugar</h3> &nbsp; This is available in pretty much all 
  Southeast and East Asian markets. I buy it in lumps of about 1 
  Tablespoon each. If you don't have it, use a lightly refines sugar 
  such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 2 T dark soy sauce, 
  but I wanted it a bit lighter, so I used 1 T dark and 1 T regular soy 
  sauce.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cassia Bark</h3> &nbsp; This is what passes for "Cinnamon" here in 
  North America, and also dominates in Southeast Asia. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ll_cinnz.html"><b>Cinnamon / Cassia</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; "Nonya Cuisine" is a fusion cuisine from the 
  Straits Chinese (Peranakan). They descend from Chinese merchants who 
  settled in Malaysia, marrying Malaysian women. The women blended Chinese 
  features into their Malaysian cuisine to please their husbands. In 
  addition to the Palm Sugar, the pattern recipe called for an additional 
  1 T of Castor Sugar. In my opinion, that much sugar would be far beyond 
  my tolerance - this recipe doesn't need it.</li>
