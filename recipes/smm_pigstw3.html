    should still be fairly liquid for serving with rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork belly:</h3> also called "uncured bacon" is readily available 
  in East and Southeast Asian markets. It may be sold as a slab or may 
  be sliced but should not be sliced thinner than about 3/8 inch. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html"><b>Pork Belly</b></a> 
  page. You could also use a mix of Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder meat, 
  cut to similar size but shorter. The photo example has some Pork Shoulder 
  in it to make up for a shortage in Pork Belly.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> This item is stated as optional in the pattern recipe, but 
  is traditional.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tofu Puffs:</h3> &nbsp; These are soft spongy cubes of deep fried 
  Tofu. They are available in pretty much any market serving an East or 
  Southeast Asian community. The ones in the photo example were about 3/4 
  inch on a side, but a bit larger is fine. If the ones you have are too 
  big, they can be cut to size. The ones used by the pattern recipe were 
  round and much softer than the ones used here, but taste the same.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is quite rich, so serving size should 
  be smaller than usual, say 7oz instead of 8oz. As in the photo example, a 
  half egg will be enough for all but the hungriest, but the amount of the 
  recipe in that dish is more than two servings.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is quite rich, but keep in mind, the 
  <a href="../diet/lowfat.html"><b>Low Fat Diet</b></a> was fraudulent from 
  it's inception. "Paid for science" by the sugar industry, knowing if you ate 
  less fat you'd eat more sugar - and also to cover up growing evidence that 
  sugar was a significant cause of heart disease.</li>
