<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are now commonly 
  available in markets serving an East or Southeast Asian community, 
  at least here in Southern California. Fresh young black eyed pea pods 
  have much the same flavor. If you have to use regular green beans, 
  cook them a shorter time. The result will be different, but 
  acceptable. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thai Eggplants:</h3> If you don't have these, substitute small 
  Indian eggplants, or if you don't have those either, any small thin 
  eggplant cut in sections. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplant.html"><b>Eggplants</b>"</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bamboo Shoots</h3> &nbsp; These are still 
  available canned in various forms, but they are much better in the 
  vacuum packed plastic bags now widely available in Asian markets. 
  If you use canned, par boil them a couple of minutes to remove the 
  canned flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_bamboo.html"><b>Bamboo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These are very small and very hot. 
  If you don't have them substitute 1 Serrano for the 3 - not as hot 
  but much larger. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Thai Basil:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Thai Purple Basil (only 
  the stems are purple) not the light green Lemon Basil, which is for 
  salads. Italian Basil is different, but an acceptable substitute. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/mt_basil.html"><b>Basil</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste</h3> &nbsp; This is the most used Thai curry 
  pastes. It is best made at home by our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. 
  "Thai Red Curry Sauce" is not Thai and not suitable.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
