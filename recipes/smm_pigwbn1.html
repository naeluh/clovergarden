  <li>Cut ends from <b>WINGED BEANS</b> and slice crosswise 1/4 inch or 
    a little larger. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> fairly thin

  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a coverable wok or saut&eacute; pan. Stir in 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring just until onions are translucent 
    - then stir in <b>Pork</b>, breaking up any clumps. Fry stirring 
    until pork has completely lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Winged Bean mix</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer covered for 
    about 15 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Uncover. Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Turn up the 
    heat and reduce the Coconut Milk to however you like it, still 
    quite liquid, lightly syrupy as in the photo example, or very 
    syrupy (but not dry). Be careful the coconut milk doesn't brown 
    to the pan.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winged Beans:</h3> &nbsp; [Sigarilyas (Philippine)] &nbsp; These 
  are finally becoming available in Asian markets here in Los Angeles 
  (2017). Previously they were only available from Asian growers at 
  farmer's markets, mostly in southern Florida. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_wingedz.html"><b>Winged Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> Both Green and Red chilis are used in the Philippines, 
  both fairly mild and very hot, alone or in combination. If using the 
  long green Sili Mahaba, use about 4 or 5. If using the tiny green or 
  red Siling Labuyo or Thai Chilis, probably 3 would be good. If using 
  more easily available Serranos, one, split in quarters lengthwise and 
  sliced crosswise should be enough. Adjust for your own taste and 
  tolerance, and what chilis are available to you. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Sili - Philippine Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; Use only unsweetened coconut milk from 
  Thailand or Vietnam, never sweetened. I have found unsweetened coconut 
  milk from Mexico less than ideal.</li>
 <li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as important to 
  Southeast Asian cooking as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Shrimp, small or coarsely chopped are 
  often included. These should go in at the end of cooking. For 
  flavoring, I chose Fish Sauce as being most available to North 
  American kitchens. In the Philippines Bangoon Alamang (shrimp paste) 
  is often used, alone or combined with Fish Sauce. Unfortunately, much 
  Philippine  Shrimp Paste is dyed florescent pink, unappetizing to 
  non-Filipinos. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a>
