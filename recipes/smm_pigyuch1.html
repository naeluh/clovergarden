  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>Pork</b>  about 1/8 inch and cut into strips 1/2 inch wide 
    and up to 2 inches long. Unlike beef pork can be cut with the grain 
    when cut thin.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and Massage into <b>Pork</b>. Set 
    aside to marinate for at least 1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>YU CHOY</b> and cut or tear the Leaves however you like. 
    Slice Stems 1/2 inch at thick ends and longer as they thin. 
    Yu Choy Stems do not need to be held separate unless they are quite 
    large, but I usually do anyway.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very 
   thin. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in
    <b>Garlic mix</b> for about 15 seconds, then stir in <b>Pork</b>. 
    Fry stirring over high flame until it has completely lost its raw 
    color. The cornstarch will start to stick to the pan, be careful it 
    does not burn. Reddish is OK, but if it's turning chocolate, go on 
    to the next step immediately.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Yu Choy Stems</b> (if separate) and fry stirring about 
    1-1/2 minutes, then stir in <b>Leaves</b> until coated with oil.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b> and bring to a boil. Scrape fond stuck 
    to the pan into the sauce. Simmer covered, turning now and then, 
    until Yu Choy stems are crisp tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> take off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  excess fat trimmed away. Just about any cut can be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable 
  Chinese rice wine, not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you 
  don't have this, use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not 
  considered a good substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">Chinese Rice Wine</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as 
  essential to Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Five Spice Powder</h3> &nbsp; This is a major 
  spice mix used in China and much of Southeast Asia. It is sold in 
  any market that serves an Asian community, but is better made at 
  home by our recipe <a href="cys_fivespc1.html">Five Spice 
  Powder</a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Yu Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This is an edible version of 
  the plant that produces the seeds canola oil is extracted from. It is 
  widely grown in North America and available in most markets serving an 
  East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cb_yuchz.html">Yu Choy</a> page. You can use other 
  forms of choy as alternatives, and Shanghai bok choy (sold as "baby 
  bok choy") is particularly good, but for other choys, give the stems 
  more of a lead over the leaves in cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia">Cabbage Greens</a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This important Chinese 
  sauce is also used in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia for dishes in the 
  Chinese style. Commercially, it varies very widely in quality. For 
  recommendations and details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html">Oyster Sauce</a> page.</li>
