One of the most popular "street food" dishes in Vietnam, a nation of 
street food. Elsewhere, it needs to be made at home. It is suitable 
for snacks, appetizers, breakfast, or as an OL vegetarian main dish.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (see recipes)
  <ol>
  <li>IF not using commercial, make <b>RICE CAKE</b> a day ahead - 
    (see <a href="smn_ricakeg1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>). Commercial works better 
    if refrigerated overnight.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>CARROT PICKLE</b> (at least 1 hour ahead).
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 min)
  <ol start="3" >
  <li>Cut <b>RICE CAKE</b> into size desired. 1 x 1-1/2 inch by 1/2 inch 
    thick is good. Some use triangles.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGGS</b> lightly.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin, keeping white and green parts separate.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Heat about 1/16th inch (1.5 mm) of a high temperature <b>Oil</b> 
    to around 385&deg;F/195&deg;C. Keeping the temperature high, fry 
    all <b>Rice Cake</b> pieces until very light golden on one side, then 
    turn and fry the other side the same (see 
    <a href="smn_ricakeg1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>). Add oil as needed to maintain the 
    depth. Remove rice cake and drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>In a 10 inch chef's pan or equiv. heat just enough <b>Oil</b> to 
    coat the pan. Scatter in the <b>Scallion Whites</b> and stir until 
    aromatic. then stir in the <b>Rice Cakes</b> until well heated. 
    Pour the <b>Eggs</b> over all the rice cakes and cook until set. At 
    this point I place a large lid over the skillet to help the eggs 
    set on top.</li>
  <li>Remove the omelet from the pan. You can plate the whole thing 
    as in the photo example, or set it on the cutting board and cut 
    into half or quarters for serving.</li>
  <li>Garnish with a scatter of <b>Scallion Greens</b>, then with the 
    <b>Carrot Pickle</b>.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with the <b>Condiments</b> listed (not optional).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Cake:</h3> &nbsp; You will need a block of Fresh Rice Cake 
  (B&aacute;nh B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n). You can purchase it commercially, 
  or you can make it yourself pretty easily. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html#373"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page 
  and our recipe <a href="sin_ricak1.html"><b>Rice Cake</b></a>. I 
  have found that commercial rice cake fries more quickly after a 
  night in the fridge.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; The number of eggs varies a great deal. Some 
  use 2 eggs, some 4 or more eggs. The photo example was made with 3 
  jumbo eggs, which I consider the minimum, so I specify 4 large eggs. 
  Choose your preference.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Carrot Diakon Pickle: </h3> &nbsp; This pickle is very popular 
  in Vietnam for garnishes, and for Banh Mi sandwiches. It is easy to 
  make by our <a href="swv_radcar1.html"><b>Daikon &amp; Carrot 
  Pickle</b></a> recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The ubiquitous Huy Fong Chili 
  Garlic Sauce will be fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong Chili Sauces</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Dip:</h3> &nbsp; B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n dip recipes vary, and many 
  are too sweet for Western tastes. Here's a 
  <a href="sjv_bcdip1.html"><b>Dip for B&ocirc;t Chi&ecirc;n</b></a> 
  that's typical (except reduced sugar) and takes only 5 minutes to make.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Frying is the main problem here. When I say 
  "light golden", I mean real light - rice doesn't brown easily. Vendors 
  who want it darker usually tumble with a few drops of dark soy sauce, 
  which includes enough sugar to brown well. You don't want to fry too 
  long, just crispy on the outside and soft inside. You could fry this 
  recipe in a 12 inch skillet in one pass, but the finished dish better 
  fits a 10 inch pan. Frying in the 10 inch pan would take two batches. 
  In Vietnam, street vendors use a very wide flat pan with about 1/16 
  inch of oil, with oil added  during the frying to maintain that depth. 
  The finished dish may be made in the same pan, isolating just the 
  right amount of rice cake and pushing the rest aside. Deep frying 
  would seem faster and easier, but the results are very different.</li>
