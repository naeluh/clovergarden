  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)

    <li>Make <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_panangcury1.html"><b>Panang Curry 
    Paste</b></a> if you don't have it on hand.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut and prepare <b>OPTION</b> 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Beef:</b> &nbsp; cut into bite size pieces about 1/4 inch thick. 
      Put in a pot with water to cover and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. 
      Drain and rinse 
      (this is to keep the curry a nice color).</li>
    <li><b>Pork</b> or <b>Chicken:</b> &nbsp; cut into bite size pieces 
      about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
    <li><b>Shrimp:</b> &nbsp; Shell and de-vein. These can be left whole 
      if not too big. Add them in for the last 4 minutes of cooking.</li>
    <li><b>Fish:</b> &nbsp; This can be cut into pieces or left whole to 
      be broken up at the table. It is usually fried or poached 
      separately and added at the last minutes. Very firm fish like 
      catfish can be added raw, as with Shrimp, but give it about 8 
      minutes of cooking.</li>
    <li><b>Potatoes:</b> &nbsp; Cut into bite size chunks about 1/2 inch 
      thick. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Roll up <b>LIME LEAVES</b> and slice extremely fine, discarding 
    central rib, then chop fine. Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1 inch 
    lengths. Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> thin. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Cap and seed <b>CHILIS</b>. Cut into narrow threads.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems and set them soaking in cold 
    water. This will slow discoloration when added to the curry.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min to 1-1/2 hr depending)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> over medium heat and stir in 
    <b>Curry Paste</b> until aromatic and well distributed in the oil, then 
    slowly stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Use care, 
    coconut milk foams over just a badly as cow milk.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Leaf mix</b> and simmer for 5 minutes or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Option</b> and simmer covered until cooked tender, adding 
    stock if needed to keep it quite liquid. Perhaps 1-1/4 hrs for Beef, 
    3/4 hr for Pork or Chicken, 20 minutes for Potatoes. For Shrimp or 
    cooked Fish simmer for 10 minutes, then add Fish or Shrimp and cook 
    4 minutes for Shrimp, 3 minutes for cooked Fish, just to warm 
    through, (see also <a href="smo_panangcury1.html#6"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>When Option is done, stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Chilis</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Sprinkle <b>Basil Leaves</b> over and serve hot with 
    plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Option:</h3> &nbsp; Most familiar in restaurants is Beef, but Pork, 
  Chicken, Potatoes, Shrimp, and Fish are also used. The best Potatoes 
  to use are White Rose, Red, or similar medium waxy type. Avoid "Yukon 
  Gold" type potatoes as they turn to mush if cooked just a little too 
  long. For Fish use a type that holds together well, Catfish (Vietnamese 
  or American) or a firm cooking ocean fish. Fish is fried or poached 
  separately to keep it from breaking up in the sauce. The photo 
  example was made with Pork.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 1-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red ripe Fresnos, though 
  other medium hot such as Holland Red can be used. Yellow chilis like 
  Hungarian Wax can also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Panang Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; You aren't likely to find this 
  in stores, but it's not hard to makd by our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_panangcury1.html"><b>Panang Curry Paste</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; If fish is cooked as whole or half fillets it 
  can be kept warm and placed in a shallow serving bowl and the finished 
  sauce pourd over. It is then broken up at the table.
