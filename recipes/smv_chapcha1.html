  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 5 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak all <b>Soak items</b> in water to cover for about 40 minutes 
    or until well rehydrated. They can be all soaked together. Drain. 
    Once soaked you can hold these for hours, or overnight in the 
    fridge.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Stem soaked <b>Mushrooms</b> and cut once across, then twice at right 
    angles (unless small, then once each way). Cut <b>Black Fungus</b> 
    into pieces about 1 inch on a side. Cut <b>Lily Buds</b> in half only if 
    very long. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CABBAGE</b> into wedges about 1-3/4 inches wide and slice 
    crosswise about 1/2 inch wide. Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice thin 
    diagonally. Mix</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, then 
    cut slices into threads. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>place your 2 skeins of <b>Bean Threads</b> in a bowl and cover with 
    cool water. Best to do this a few minutes before starting cooking.</li>
  <li>In a wok (13 inch is good) heat <b>OIL</b> over moderately high flame. 
    Fry <b>Garlic mix</b> stirring until just aromatic, then stir in 
    <b>Fermented Tofu</b> and 1 T <b>Water</b>. Fry stirring and crushing the
    Tofu until it is evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Soak mix</b> and <b>Cabbage mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    over higher heat for 1 minute, then stir in <b>Tofu Puffs</b> and 2 T 
    <b>Water</b>. Tumble it all well and cover. Lower heat and let steam, 
    stirring several times, until Cabbage is wilted, but still has crunch. 
    </li>
  <li>Drain <b>Bean Threads</b>. Cut the skeins in half crosswise and gently 
    tumble into the Vegies. Stir in <b>Salt</b> and continue to steam, 
    tossing a couple times, for another 3 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot, along with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. This recipe can 
    be carefully reheated, back in the wok.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; This can be Napa Cabbage, White Cabbage (yes, they 
  have it in Asia), or any of the Choys, or a mix of any. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage & Mustard Greens</b></a> 
  page (the Asian Greens section).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the regular dried Shiitakes 
  available anywhere with an Asian section. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; (25 grams) This common item is available in 
  most markets serving an East or Southeast Asian community. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lily Buds, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in markets serving an 
  East or Southeast Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_daylil.html"><b> Daylily - Golden Needles</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Bean Threads</h3> &nbsp; [Glass Noodles] &nbsp; These are usually 
  packed in skeins of 50 grams (1.8 ounces). This recipe will need 2 skeins. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html#bean"><b>Asian 
  Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fermented Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; (23 grams) Several forms are available in 
  jars from practically any market serving an East or Southeast Asian 
  community. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofufz.html">
  <b>Fermented Tofu</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Tofu Puffs:</h3> &nbsp; These should be whole small ones, but medium 
  ones can be cut. The pattern recipe called for 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#pouch"><b>Tofu Puffs</b></a>, but the photo 
  example used <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html#dfsc"><b>Deep Fried Soybean 
  Cake</b></a> which works fine in stir fries. These are found in any number 
  of sizes and shapes in markets serving a significant East or Southeast Asian 
  community. When buying, examine carefully for mold. They can be frozen if 
  not used immediately.</li> 
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> "Nonya Cuisine" is a fusion cuisine from the Nonyas 
  ("Aunties") of the Straits Chinese (Peranakan). They descend from Chinese 
  merchants who settled in Malaysia, marrying Malaysian women. The women 
  blended Chinese features into their Malaysian cuisine to please their 
  husbands. Originally from Fujian, China, this stir fry is now popular, 
  in its infinite forms, throughout Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.</li>
