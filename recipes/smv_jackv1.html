A Southeast Asian curry using jackfruit in place of chicken or other meat. 
This is often done in Southeast Asia for vegetarian fare. The curry sauce 
is unusual but works quite well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>First make <b>CURRY PASTE</b>. Roll up the lime leaves and cut into 
    thin threads, discard the ribs and chop the threads. Chop all solid 
    ingredients very fine and pound into a paste in the order given (or use 
    a mini-prep processor if you lack the large granite mortar). Mix in all 
    the liquid ingredients and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Jackfruit</b> into strips about 1/8 inch thick and 1/2 inch 
    wide, or into whatever shape you want or can do from the starting 
    shape.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> into thin wedges.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> into 1/2 inch wide strips about 1-1/2 inches 
    long.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>RAW CASHEWS</b> until lightly browned - they will be 
    spotted.</li>
  <li>For garnish remove some <b>Basil Leaves</b> from stems and start them 
    soaking in cold water (keeps them green longer).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> 
    over very high heat until starting to become translucent, then stir 
    in <b>Bell Peppers</b> and and fry stirring until crisp tender - with  
    a few browned streaks if your stove can manage it. Remove with a slotted 
    spoon, leaving as much oil as possible, and hold aside.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Jackfruit</b> to the pan. Fry stirring until coated with oil, 
    then stir in <b>Curry Paste</b> and <b>Coconut Milk</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    cover and simmer over low heat until Jackfruit is tender but not mushy 
    (it should shred easily).</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Peppers</b> back in, Check flavor balance and correct if 
    needed. Simmer about 2 minutes more. Don't overcook.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Cashews</b>, garnish with <b>Basil Leaves</b> and serve 
    with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Jackfruit:</h3> &nbsp; 13 ounces is 1 package of frozen green 
  jackfruit. Canned green jackfruit in brine can be used. For details, 
  see our <a href="../ingred/mb_jackrz.html"><b>Unripe Jackfruit</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cashews:</h3> &nbsp; Raw is best, but if all you have is 
  commercially roasted they can be used (different flavor) if unsalted - 
  or give them a quick rinse to get the salt off.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Coconut Milk:</h3> &nbsp; This amount is actually somewhat 
  variable. I call 5.6 ounces because that is the size of the small 
  Aroy-D cans I always have on hand.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 3 stems (unless one of the leaves on your stems is 
  very small). For details See our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html">
  <b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If you don't have them, grate the zest of 
  the limes before you squeeze them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Red Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Thai red chili is fine, or whatever fresh 
  red chili you have - Arbol, Fresnos, Holland Red or similar is fine. 
  Increase if you want the dish hotter (it's very mild with just one Thai 
  Chili). For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Thai Purple Basil:</h3> &nbsp; For the curry paste, the measure is 
  1/2 cup lightly packed whole leaves. If you don't have Thai, regular 
  purple basil is good, but don't use Thai lemon basil - that's for 
  salads. For details see our <a href="../ingred/mt_basiltz.html">
  <b>Thai Purple Basil</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce is easily 
  available - but if you want pure vegetarian you can use 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> or 
  see our recipe for <a href="sjv_vegfish1.html"><b>Vegetarian Fish 
  Sauce</b></a>. Commercial vegetarian fish sauce is available, but 
  generally pretty awful.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Any good quality but not strongly flavored oil 
  is fine - I always use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin).</li>
