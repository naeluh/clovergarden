Faced with serving a mixed couple (carni & veg), I modified my highly 
successful <a href="smc_chkcury4.html"><b>Chicken Curry, Sumatra</b></a> 
so I could simultneously make a vegetarian version.
vegetarian version - see <a href="smv_potcury1.html#10"><b>Versions</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>POTATOES</b>.into chunks about 3/4 inch square and 1/2 inch 
    thick, or however you like. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FRIED TOFU</b> and <b>KING TRUMPETS</b> into chunks of similar 
    size to the Potatoes. Cut <b>TOFU SKINS</b> however makes sense for 
    the form you have. Usually strips can be tied into knots so they're 
    not too stringy. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Without shaking up the can, open a 14 ounce can of <b>Coconut Milk</b>. 
    Skim 4 ounces of the thick cream off the top for the paste. Reserve 
    the rest for the curry.</li> 
  <li>Grind the <b>CHILIS</b> to powder in your spice grinder. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Slice <b>ONION</b> thin and chop fine. 
    Crush <b>Candlenuts</b>. Mix all together in a large mortar and pound 
    to paste,</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Coconut Cream</b> into the paste until it is all even.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Galangal</b> thin and mix all <b>Finish items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> moderately 
    hot. Stir in <b>Paste</b> and fry stirring until aromatic, about 1 
    minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in drained <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Tofu mix</b> until coated 
    with paste, then stir in <b>Finish mix</b>. Simmer slowly, covered, 
    stirring often  until Potatoes are tender, about 1/2 hour. Check 
    liquid now and then to make sure it doesn't dry out.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes work well, or Red 
  potatoes. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes which disintegrate to 
  mush if cooked a little long. For details se our
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page. Actually 
  <a href="../ingred/am_taroz.html"><b>Taro Roots</b></a> would be more 
  authentic and would work fine, but I prefer potatoes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Deep Fried Tofu:</h3> &nbsp; Cubes of deep fried tofu are available 
  in practically any Asian market. You can cut the to the desired size. 
  You can make them yourself by deep frying cubes of firm tofu until 
  light golden. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html">
  <b>Tofu</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Tofu Skins:</h3> &nbsp; I use fresh skins because 
  they are available here, but dried skins (Bean Curd Skin Sticks) are 
  more widely available. Soak them until flexible and tie strips into 
  knots. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>King Trumpet Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; These are now grown in 
  California and available in just about any Asian market here. They 
  range from large to huge. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Coconut Cream:</h3> &nbsp; No, you don't have to open a whole can 
  - see instruction step 3.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Thai or de Arbols are good. Four makes a 
  satisfyingly hot curry by Southern California standards, or use 
  Japones for less heat - use you own best judgement. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Candlenuts:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have these, substitute 4 raw 
  Macadamia Nuts or 5 raw Cashews or 9 raw almonds. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sr_candlez.html"><b>Candlenut</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="08"><h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this, 
  substitute a lightly refined sugar like Turbinado - a little less tasty 
  but tolerable.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Salam Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; These can be found in the "Indonesian 
  specialties" section of some large Asian markets. A package will have 
  many sizes, but figure an average Salam Leaf is about the size of a l
  arge Bay Leaf, and compensate as needed. If you don't have these, you 
  may have a problem. Curry leaves are the best substitute, but bay 
  leaves, often suggested, are not so suitable. If that's all you have, 
  use just one, and a half teaspoon of lime juice. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/my_dsalamz.html"><b>Daun Salam</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Versions</h3> &nbsp; It was easy for me to simultaneously make 
  both Chiken and Vegetarian versions, because most ingredients could be 
  made in one batch and split between the two recipes. The vegetarian 
  version was also very successful, but is more complex than the chicken 
  version because it is composed from simpler flavors.</li>
