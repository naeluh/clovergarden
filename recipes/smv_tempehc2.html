A curry typical Java. Tempeh is very popular there and is the "meatiest" 
of the fermented soy products. It is used to make vegetarian dishes 
similarly to how meat is used.

<p>This curry could also be made with chicken or eggs (see

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>TEMPEH</b> into pieces about 3/4 inch by 1-1/2 inches by 
    whatever thickness your cake is. Heat <b>Oil</b> in a 
    <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html">kadhai</a>, wok or iron skillet and 
    fry until lightly browned and a bit crispy on the outside. Drain and 
    set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>TOFU</b> into blocks of similar size to the Tempeh. Drain well 
    and fry in the oil until very lightly browned. Do not fry as dark as you 
    would for stuffing pockets or it will be too tough. Drain and set aside. 
    This isn't always done, but, hey, you've already got the hot oil sitting 
    there, so why not?</li>
  <li>Prep <b>TAMARIND</b> if using block (see <a href="smv_tempehc2.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Smash <b>Candlenuts</b> to paste in a mortar. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and chop fine. Add to the mortar and pound. Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine. 
    Add to the mortar and pound, or run in a mini-prep processor or 
    whatever you can manage. Mix all with <b>Sambal Oelec</b>, 
    <b>Tamarind</b>, <b>Turmeric</b>, and <b>Salt</b>..</li>
  <li>Strip off tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off 
    the hard root end. Cut off the bottom 5 inches and smash the bottom 
    4 inches with your kitchen mallet leaving an inch to hold it together. 
    Rumple the <b>Lime Leaves</b> well to release the flavor. 
    Slice <b>Galangal</b> thin. Mix all.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Shallot Paste</b> stirring until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Grass mix</b> and continue to fry stirring for 
    another minute or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Tempeh</b>, <b>Tofu</b> and  
    <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Bring to a boil uncovered 
    (coconut milk foams over worse than cow milk) and simmer slowly for 
    about 10 minutes or more, uncovered or covered to control how liquid 
    the curry is (I like it fairly liquid).</li>
  <li>Pick out the hard stems and leaves with chopsticks.</li>
  <li>Serve with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tempeh:</h3> &nbsp; This fermented soybean product can be found in 
  the frozen food cases of many Asian markets and in some natural food 
  markets. Cakes will be flat, about 3/4 inches thick and will weigh 
  typically 8 to 11 ounces. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soytz.html"><b>Tempeh</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Candlenuts:</h3> &nbsp; These are oily nuts similar in appearance 
  to Macadamia nuts (but not related). Popular in Southeast Asia, 
  Candlenuts aren't easy to find in North America and they tend to 
  be already rancid by time they're on the shelf here. The recommended 
  substitute is raw Macadamia nuts - but that doesn't help much either, 
  does it? Raw Cashews are more available, and Raw Blanched Almonds are 
  the next preference (but you need to use about 10 because they're 
  smaller.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sambal Oelek:</h3> &nbsp; This is a chili paste without garlic. 
  The very widely available Huy Fong brand from Los Angeles is not 
  strictly authentic, since it uses tasty red ripe jalapeno peppers 
  unavailable in Indonesia - but I don't hear anyone complaining. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Huy Fong 
  Chili Sauces</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Use concentrate, or block prepared as 
  described on our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lemon Grass</h3> &nbsp; Available in markets serving a Southeast 
  Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 2-1/2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; This is related to, and looks a lot like 
  ginger root, but is hard as board and with more of a camphor taste. 
  If you can't find it use slices of Ginger Root instead, not the 
  same, but suitable. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; This curry can be made with all Tempeh or 
  all Tofu, or 2 pounds of Chicken joints (<i>Ayam Bumbu Rujak</i>), 
  or 6 or 7 hard boiled eggs (<i>Telur Bumbu Rujak</i>). Cut some 
  shallow slashes in the eggs so the curry can penetrate. Of course it 
  would not be made with Pork in Indonesia (except Bali), but we 
  infidels can use whatever we want.</li>
