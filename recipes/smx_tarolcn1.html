This recipe originated in Bicol at the southeast corner of Luzon, where 
coconuts are grown and much coconut milk and hot chilis are used. 
It spread from there all over the Philippines.

<p>This recipe can be made with pork, shrimp, beef or vegetarian.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut stems from <b>TARO LEAVES</b> and cut into small strips 
    (see <a href="smx_tarolcn1.html#05"><b>Cutting</b></a>). If using dry, soak them for 
    a while so you can chop them easily.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>PORK BELLY</b> about 3/4 inch on a side, including the 
    skin.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin crosswise, and cut the slices into 
    narrow matchsticks. Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and crush. Mix.</li> 
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Slice 
    <b>CHILES</b> thin crosswise. Mix.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using dried Taro Leaves, skim most of the Cream off 
    the top of the cans of <b>Coconut Milk</b>. Reserve it and add near 
    the end of cooking.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Pork</b> stirring until all 
    raw color is gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Ginger mix</b> and fry stirring about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring until Onions and 
    Pork start to color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Taro Leaves</b> and 1/2 cup <b>Water</b>. tumble until 
    they are fairly wilted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Coconut Milk</b> and bring to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Bagoong</b>. Cover and simmer slowly for about 1 hr, stirring the 
    Taro Leaves down under the Coconut Milk frequently. <u>IF</u> you 
    have reserved the Coconut Cream, pour it in when the recipe has 
    15 minutes to go.</li> 
  <li>Adjust liquid if needed. Serve with steamed Jasmine rice. Note: 
    this recipe is even better rested overnight and reheated.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Taro Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fresh Taro Leaves with 
  stems removed. Dried Taro Leaves are more often used due to 
  availability. For dried, use 2-1/4 ounces, about 3-1/2 cups lightly 
  packed. Dried leaves will have a much darker color and a somewhat 
  different flavor. Note that throat irritation is not a problem in 
  this recipe, with fresh or dried leaves. For details see  
  our <a href="../ingred/am_tarolz.html"><b>Taro Leaves / Stems</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Belly or:</h3> &nbsp; Pork Belly is the preferred meat 
  addition, but regular pork could also be used. Beef is used 
  occasionally and shrimp are fairly common. This recipe can 
  be made vegetarian (except for the shrimp paste) by omitting the 
  pork, but I think including some dice of Taro Roots would be good 
  idea in a vegetarian version.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; 4 of these makes for a moderately spicy 
  dish, but if you have doubts, use 3. Of course, even 4 is a bit scant 
  for Bicol. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bagoong:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Ginisang Bagoong (Bagoong 
  Guisado), the brown fried version. For details see our  
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / Paste</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cutting:</h3> &nbsp; I take a bunch of leaves and cut each from 
  the stem attach to the bottom notch so they lie flat. I stack them 
  and make one cut down the center and one down each side so I have 4 
  strips. I then pile the strips and cut them 
  crosswise about 3/4 inch.</li>
