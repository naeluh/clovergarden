Easy to make, this soup has a light flavor and a thick smooth consistency. 
It can serve as either a soup course or as a light main dish. Though not 
in the original recipe, it seems not quite right to me without Straw 
Mushrooms, so I usually add a can of those.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>DRIED RICE NOODLES</b>: Break them to a 
    convenient length and place them in a heatproof bowl. Boil plenty 
    of water and pour it over the rice noodles. Let them soak about 20 
    minutes to an hour depending on thickness. Drain. If they were in 
    a skein, set the lump on your cutting board and make a few cuts 
    across it so they are of manageable length.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>FRESH RICE NOODLES</b>, break them to a 
    convenient length depending on thickness - thick ones shorter.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into strips about 1/8 inch thick, 1/2 inch wide 
    and 1 inch long.</li>
  <li>Pull tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off the hard 
    root end. Cut the bottom 6 inches of each into two 3 inch lengths. 
    Crush the large end of each piece with your kitchen mallet, leaving 
    the other end to hold the brush together.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Chop <b>CILANTRO ROOT</b> fine. Mix all and pound to a paste in a 
    large  mortar, or run in a mini-prep food processor as fine as you 
    can get it.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b> and split into shreds.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. 
  <li>Separate <b>CILANTRO LEAVES</b> from the stems for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In a Saucepan, mix <b>Coconut Milk</b>, <b>Stock</b>, <b>Lemon 
    Grass</b>, <b>Galangal</b> and the <b>Shallot mix</b>. Bring up 
    to a boil uncovered (coconut milk foams over even worse than cow 
    milk). Cover and simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and simmer another 10  to 20 minutes 
    until tender.</li>
  <li>Fish out <b>Lemon Grass</b> and <b>Galangal</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rice Noodles</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Chilis</b>. 
    Simmer until noodles are tender (2 to 15 minuts).</li>
  <li>Take off heat and stir in <b>Lime Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

  <b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for dried rice noodles (most 
  available). If using fresh, use double the weight. Dried ones should 
  be no thicker than 0.07 inches (1.8 mm) and even those will need an 
  hour to soak. Fresh ones can be up to 0.16 inch (4 mm). The photo example 
  was made with Thin Rice Noodles (0.04 inch / 1 mm). For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html"><b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page.
  </li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless. 
  I use thigh meat which has much more flavor than the dry cardboard breast 
  meat we get around here.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Galangal</h3> &nbsp; This board hard relative of ginger imparts 
  a unique flavor to Southeast Asian soups and stews. Fresh is best but 
  frozen is fine. Dried and powdered is not acceptable. If you don't 
  have it, use fresh Ginger Root - not at all the same, but acceptable. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html">
  <b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cilantro Root:</h3> &nbsp; This is very difficult 
  to find even here in Los Angeles. We usually have to resort to using 
  Cilantro Stems (no leaves). Increase the amount by half as stems are 
  bulkier (measure is after chopping fine).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; This amount makes a fairly mild soup by 
  Southern California standards - use your own best judgement here. If 
  you don't have Thai chilis, fresh Arobols (red or green) are a good 
  substitute, or one small Serrano. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
