A very fine light soup course, a bit different from Chinese 
<a href="com_wintermelon1.html"><b>Winter Melon Soup</b></a>. Chicken 
is used instead of pork due to the Muslim population in Singapore, 
and it has a more complex flavor and more color.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 minutes - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in a cup of warm water for about 30 minutes, 
    then squeeze them out, <u>keeping soaking liquid</u> and slice into 
    1/4 in squares.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>WINTER MELON</b> with a vegetable peeler, just enough to 
    remove the hard green. Discard seeds and stringy stuff and cut it into 
    1/2 in cubes (not larger).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into 1/2 in cubes removing any fat you can.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin, then into narrow matchsticks.  Make two 
    deep cuts into each <b>RED DATE</b> so the sweetness can get out. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>GARNISH</b>, as many listed items as you wish to use. 
    Slice <b>Scallions</b> very thin on a diagonal. Separate 
    <b>Cilantro leaves</b>. Set out <b>Sesame Oil</b> (if used) so you 
    can dispense just a couple drops into each bowl.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Put <b>Mushroom soaking liquid</b> and enough <b>Stock</b> to make 
    6 cups in a pot. Add <b>Mushrooms</b>, <b>Chicken</b>, <b>Ginger</b>, 
    and <b>Dates</b>, Bring to a boil and simmer covered about 10 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Winter Melon</b> and continue to simmer until melon is just 
    cooked through (it will become translucent and settle deeper into the 
    liquid).</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li> 
  <li>Ladle into serving bowels. Stir just a few drops of <b>Sesame Oil</b> 
    (if using) into each bowl and add just a little of each garnish you 
    are using (don't overdo it). Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; These are available, usually as large 
  wedges or slices, in just about any market serving an East or Southeast 
  Asian community, and sometimes in Indian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html"><b>Ash Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken meat should be without skin and with 
  as much fat removed as possible. Thigh meat is best for flavor and 
  texture.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Dates</h3> &nbsp; Not at all related to Middle Eastern dates, 
  these are actually dried jujubes. Find them in Asian markets among the 
  other dried items. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bt_jujuz.html"><b>JuJubes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dried Scallops</h3> are a common flavoring ingredient in China 
  and Southeast Asia. They are small, about 0.4 inches in diameter and 
  0.5 inches long. Find them in the refrigerated section of well stocked 
  Asian markets. If you don't have them, dried squid is a good substitute, 
  or use a few bits of salt cod or similar dried fish. You could use 
  smoked bacon (lean only) or a few dice of cooked ham, if no Jews or 
  Muslims are on your invite list.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; A rather light chicken stock would be 
  appropriate. The 6 cups includes the mushroom soaking liquid.</li>
