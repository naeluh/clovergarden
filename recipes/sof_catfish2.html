  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CATFISH</b> into about 1 inch squares.</li>
  <li>IF dry, soak <b>RICE NOODLES</b> in warm water for at least 20 
    minutes if thin, an hour if thicker. They can be held in cool water 
    for hours.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin, cut into threads and chop fine.</li>
  <li> Remove tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. Smash with your kitchen mallet and then slice crosswise as 
    thin as you can from the bottom for about 5 inches. Discard the top 
    and chop the slices fine.</li>
  <li>Pound both <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Lemon Grass</b> to paste in a mortar 
    and mix with <b>Onions</b>, along with <b>Turmeric</b> and <b>Salt</b>.
    </li>     
  <li>Cut <b>SMALL ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise. If not all that 
    small, cut into more wedges. Cut <b>CHILIS</b> in half lengthwise, 
    remove seeds and membranes to the extent you want to control heat, 
    and slice into threads. Mix.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>GARNISHES</b> as desired (just one or two, not all of 
    them).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; ()
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a heavy bottomed sauce pan and fry <b>Onion Mix</b> 
    stirring over moderate heat until soft and aromatic but not at all 
    browned.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Rice Flour</b> in well. Stir in a cup of <b>Water</b> until 
    smooth, then stir in the rest of the water and the <b>Fish Sauce</b> 
    Bring to a boil, cover and  simmer slowly for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the rice noodles.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Catfish</b> and <b>Vegies mix</b> into the soup. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes. At this point you can 
    set it aside and reheat later if desired.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, drain <b>Rice Noodles</b> and stir into the 
    boiling water. Strain out immediately and divide into bowls (see 
    <a href="sof_catfish2.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> and <a href="sof_catfish2.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a> 
    for details. Ladle soup over the noodles and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Catfish:</h3> &nbsp; Southeast Asian catfish (basa, tra, swai) are 
  a bit different in shape and have a more delicate texture and flavor 
  than American channel cat. The frozen fillets now so common here in 
  North America have been skillfully prepared to remove most of the 
  fish flavor. I usually buy frozen fish, just beheaded and gutted which 
  will have more flavor. American Channel Catfish can be used, as well 
  as Walking Catfish, sold in Southern California as Yellow Catfish. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_catz.html"><b>Catfish</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; This weight is for dry noodles to produce 
  6 servings. If you have fresh rice noodles use 1 pound for the same 
  number of servings. See our <a href="../ingred/pa_ricez.html">
  <b>Rice Noodles</b></a> page for details.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems can be found in 
  markets serving a Southeast Asian community. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Red Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but 
  other medium hot red chilis will work fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cooking Noodles:</h3> &nbsp; Rice noodles will turn quickly to 
  mush in boiling water. Whether fresh of soaked they need only be in the 
  water until heated. I drop them in, then immediately pour the water out 
  through a strainer into a bowl. The water can be returned to the pot to 
  heat more noodles if needed. Of course, if you want a more porridge 
  like consistency, just leave them in for a few minutes and they will 
  start to break up.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving;</h3> &nbsp; To serve with Rice Noodles, you must serve in 
  individual bowls. Put some noodles in the bowl and ladle in some soup 
  over them. If you need it finished in the pot so you can just ladle it 
  out as needed, use cooked Jasmine rice instead of noodles. Another way 
  to serve is to put neither in, but provide a bowl of steamed Jasmine 
  rice on the table to be spooned in as desired. This could also be 
  done with rice noodles (provide tongs).</li>
