This amazing fish soup is from the Shan in eastern Burma, bordering 
China, Laos and Thailand. While incorporating elements from its 
neighbors, Shan cuisine is unique and outstanding.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <br>For method see note <a href="sof_fsharo1.html#09"><b>Pastes</b></a>.
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILLETS</b> into largish bite size chunks. </li>
  <li>Peel off toughest outer leaves of <b>LEMONGRASS</b>. Cut off the 
    hard root end. Smash the bottom 5 inches with your kitchen mallet, 
    then slice crosswise as thin as you can. Place in a mortar with 
    1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and pound to as close to a paste as you can.</li>    
  <li>Chop <b>TURMERIC ROOT</b> small and add to the mortar. Continue 
    to pound into paste.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise, then chop medium.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CHILIS</b> crosswise.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO STEMS</b> small.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>SHALLOTS</b>, cut in half lengthwise and chop coarse. </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse.</li>
  <li>Reduce to a paste in a large mortar and/or food processor. </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Paste #1</b> with <b>Paste #2</b> and Add 1/2 t <b>Salt</b>.
    </li> 
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water, quench in 
    cold water. Peel and cut into 3/4 inch pieces.</li>  
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>TUA NAO</b>, toast a disk over flame or in a dry 
    pan until slightly darkened. Let cool thoroughly, then grind in your 
    spice grinder. <u>IF</u> not using Tua Nao, use 1 t <b>Dark Miso</b>.
    </li>
  <li>For Garnish, chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> small.</li>
  <li>For Garnish Pinch <b>CILANTRO</b> and/or <b>BASIL</b> leaves from 
    stems. If using Thai Basil, soak the leaves in cold water until 
    needed for better color retention. Measure is loosely packed.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a 4 quart pot, place <b>Broth</b> and bring to a boil. Stir 
    in <b>Paste mix</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Tua Nao</b> powder and 
    1 T <b>Salt</b>. <u>If</u> using Miso instead of Tua Nao, hold 
    until later. Keep at a slow boil for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>If using Miso, mix a little hot Broth into it until creamy, then 
    stir into Broth.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> Bring back to a boil over high flame, then 
    turn to a fast simmer until fish will flake, usually about 5 minutes 
    from boiling. If doing ahead, stir in the Fish and Herbs just 
    before serving.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Scallions</b>, then <b>Herbs</b> and take off the heat.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice (see 
    <a href="sof_fsharo1.html#10"><b>Serving</b></a>). The finished dish can be 
    reheated with care, depending on the fish selected.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for cleaned fish 
  cut into steaks. I don't trust my guests with fish bones, so I use 
  fillets, though channel catfish steaks would be OK. For Fish Steaks 
  you'd need about 3-1/2 pounds of cleaned headless fish, or about 5 
  pounds of whole uncleaned fish. See <a href="sof_fsharo1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a> 
  for much more detail on the fish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for Southeast Asian cuisines, 
  these tough grass stems are now widely available in North American 
  markets that serve a Southeast Asian community. I've even seen them 
  in some Korean markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Turmeric Root:</h3> &nbsp; This can be found in markets serving a 
  South or Southeast Asian community. If you do not have it, use 1/2 
  Tablespoon Turmeric powder. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_turmerz.html"><b>Turmeric</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili, Green:</h3> &nbsp; For group with mixed chili tolerance I 
  use 2 small Thai chilis, more if I will be the only one eating it. 
  The pattern recipe calls for 1/2 cup sliced green cayenne chilis 
  (Thai chilis are a cayenne type), which seems to me a bit excessive - 
  use your own best judgement here. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cilantro Stems:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Cilantro Roots, but 
  those are nearly impossible to find even here in Southern California. 
  Stems are as close as we can get (no leaves).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tua Nao Disks:</h3> &nbsp; These are disks of dried fermented 
  soybean paste. You can make them per our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sip_tuanao1.html"><b>Tua Nao Paste, Disks</b></a>, or 
  they are available on line from Yoma Myanmar in Boston.  <u>Subst</u>: 
  If you don't have the disks, use 1/2 Tablespoon Japanese dark miso 
  in this recipe. Note when to put it in.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe allows plain water, but if 
  you have some fish stock on hand, or can make some, you can have a 
  more richly flavored soup. If you bought cleaned head-off fish, it is 
  stil worthwhile making a light stock from the bones and fins. If you 
  bought whole, head-on fish you can make a stronger stock. The pattern 
  recipe says to toss in any heads you have with the rest of the fish, 
  a common practice in Southeast Asia, but I prefer to make stock 
  separately. For details on how to make and how to store fish stock 
  see our recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish 
  Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Shan State is an inland region with major rivers, 
  so river fish would be used there, such as Catfish, Carp or farmed 
  Tilapia. Carp is delicious, but shot full of thread bones most 
  Americans haven't learned to handle, so I don't serve it. Vietnamese 
  Catfish is fine, and American Channel Cat could even be included 
  as steaks, as in the pattern recipe. Tilapia holds up to wet cooking 
  just well enough for soups and stews. The photo example was made with 
  Walking Catfish [Clarias Fish] (skin-on) and Tilapia fillets 
  (skin-off). If I make soups like this from ocean fish, my favorites 
  are Japanese Amberjack and Golden Pompano. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very large page).</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Pastes:</h3> &nbsp; After chopping fine, I run Paste #1 in my 
  mini-prep processor as fine as it will get. I then pound it in a big 
  stone mortar. I run Paste #2 in the processor, then add it to the 
  mortar and pound some more until blended. Add items to processor in 
  order given, especially garlic last as it tends to gum things up. 
  This double process gives me the desired texture from pounding with 
  a lot less pounding.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia, soups are usually ladled 
  onto the rice. For Western service I find it much more convenient to 
  serve the soup in individual bowls and provide a bowl of Jasmine 
  rice on the table with a spoon so diners can spoon some into their 
  soup bowl to mix as they wish.</li>
