This recipe makes 4-3/4 cups, enough for 4 soup courses or two main dish 
soups. It can be made ahead, but for good color, don't stir in the Leek 
mix until ready to serve.

Grilling small items is quick and convenient in Southeast Asia, where 
kitchen fires are live most of the day - not so much here in the West -

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; Snapper or any white 
  fish that holds together reasonably well with wet cooking will do fine. 
  The photo example was made with Tilapia fillets, which is what we had 
  on hand.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 
  for Oyster Mushrooms. Some of new firm Oyster Mushrooms will work 
  fine. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for 
  Southeast Asian cuisines, these tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04"><b>Chili, Green:</b> &nbsp; Around here we have choices, 
  Korean (mildest), Indian (hotter), Serranos (hot), Thai (hottest, but 
  small). In most regions you may have only Serranos, and will probably 
  not want to use more than half of one - use your own best judgement 
  here. For details see our  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a stem, so this 
  recipe will need 2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia the stock is not necessarily 
  keyed to the main ingredient, so either a Fish Stock or Chicken Stock 
  can be used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If your are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Leeks:</h3> &nbsp; White part only. This is more practical with 
  Asian Leeks which are much thinner than common supermarket leeks. 
  They are easily available in Los Angeles, but not in most regions.
  </li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Dill:</h3> &nbsp; It may seem odd to use Dill in Southeast Asian 
  cuisines, but it is now quite common through what was French Indochina 
  (Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia).</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Roasting a small amount of ingredients 
  is rather inconvenient in the Western kitchen. I gave this a lot of 
  thought, and suddenly realized I had just the tool to make it quick 
  and easy - hanging unused in the far corner: a <a 
  href="../ke/ke_jtoastz.html"><b>Japanese Mesh Toaster Pan</b></a>
  Even if you have such a device, I recommend blasting the Green Chili 
  black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> 
  and rubbing off the skin under running water. This avoids having 
  annoying flakes of chili skin floating around in the soup.
