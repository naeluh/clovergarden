This soup is outstandingly delicious - don't let "Sour" or the lengthy 
notes scare you off - it's very mildly sour and quite easy to make. This 
soup is usually made with Bangus (Milkfish) but other fish are used.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;(45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Fish Stock</b> from heads bones and fins. This can be done 
    well in advance (see <a href="sof_fshsini1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>), or while 
    doing all the cutting - fish stock takes only 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>FISH</b> as desired (see <a href="sof_fshsini1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>) and cut into the size pieces you prefer.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b>, if not using prepared paste from a 
    jar (see <a href="sof_fshsini1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>     
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and cut into chunks about 3/4 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>DAIKON</b> into half rounds or quarter rounds depending on 
    size. Slice thin.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHILIS</b> as you like. They can be simply split, or 
    sliced diagonally, or whatever.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin crosswise and cut into narrow strips.
    </li> 
  <li>Rinse <b>WATER SPINACH</b> (or whatever green you will be using), 
    remove oversize stems and cut into about 1-1/2 to 2 inch lengths.
    </li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a 5 quart non-reactive soup pot, combine <b>Stock</b> with 
    <b>Onions</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Tamarind</b>. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Radish</b>, <b>Fish</b> and <b>Shellfish</b>. Bring 
    to a boil over high heat, then simmer about 5 minutes. &nbsp; Note: 
    &nbsp; If including vegetables more substantial than Water Spinach, 
    for instance stems from bok choy, they may need to go in at this 
    time.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water Spinach</b>, <b>Chilis</b> and <b>Fish Sauce</b>. 
    Don't overstir, you don't want to break up the fish. Bring to a boil 
    over high heat and simmer no more than 2 minutes, by time it gets 
    to a boil, it's done.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b> to taste. This will depend on the stock and 
    how much fish sauce is used - my stock has no salt, so it takes 
    a full teaspoon here. Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is cleaned, boned and without tails or 
  fins. Shellfish are often included in Sinigang Isda (Fish), but just 
  Bangus in Sinigang Bangus, etc. The traditional fish for this soup is 
  Bangus (Milkfish), but that presents a problem for folks unaccustomed 
  to eating fish who's flesh is full of pin bones (bangus, carp, shad 
  etc.). Unlike a carp, you can debone a bangus, and you can buy it 
  deboned and frozen in Philippine markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_milkz.html"><b>Milkfish</b></a> page. Tilapia 
  is now also popular, and other fish with white or light colored flesh 
  that stands up to wet cooking will work fine. 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_snakehz.html"><b>Snakehead</b></a> [Mudfish] 
  is also excellent but the heads and fins don't make good stock. I would 
  say <a href="../ingred/sf_catz.html"><b>Catfish</b></a> too, though 
  farming catfish is still new to the Philippines. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Preparation:</h3> &nbsp; In the Philippines, fish are often 
  just scaled, cleaned, and cut up crosswise into fairly large chunks. 
  The heads are left on for extra flavor in the soup. Bangus is generally 
  not boned and the pin bones are managed at the table. You may wish to 
  do differently, using fillets, with or without skin depending on the 
  fish. Since I usually serve buffet style, I use Tilapia fillets, 
  skin-on and cut about 1-1/2 inches on a side. I use the heads, fins 
  and bones to make the stock separately. In the case of small catfish, 
  I might just use cross cut chunks and use stock made from other types 
  of fish. For Snakehead, I'd use fillets skin-on and make stock from 
  the bones and some other fish. In Asia it is permitted to use chicken 
  stock in fish dishes.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shellfish:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't wish to use shellfish, just 
  increase the amount of regular fish by 10 ounces. Shrimp, squid, clams 
  and mussels are appropriate.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This can be prepared paste from a jar 
  (good) or prepared by you from blocks of tamarind pulp (better). For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> 
  page. Many Philippine recipes call for packages of Knorr or Mama 
  Sita's Sinigang sa Sampalok powder. Those are imperfectly available 
  in North American markets, but pure tamarind is very common. Some 
  recipes call for a couple green tamarind pods, which may or may not 
  be available frozen in Philippine markets. Others use Calamansi or 
  other citrus juices, Green Mango or Guavas for the sourness. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Use a small one - big ones are OK raw, 
  but tend to be fibrous cooked. Regular red or white radishes can also 
  be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for about "3 Finger 
  Chilis" (Chili Pangsigang / Mahaba). These are not available in North 
  America, so I use Serranos, but these vary wildly in hotness these 
  days. Adjust to your own taste and the hotness of your chilis. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html">
  <b>Sili - Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Water Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Ong Choy, Kang kong] This is widely 
  available in Asian markets in California, and may be transported here 
  without a permit, but is a controlled substance in many states. 
  Substitutes include watercress, regular spinach, chili leaves, sweet 
  potato leaves, bok choy, etc. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp;  If you buy your fish whole, you can make the 
  stock from the heads, fins and bones, even far ahead. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a> page. I usually 
  make the stock using more fish than needed for the recipe for a richer 
  stock - and freeze the extra fillets. If you don't have whole fish, 
  use water, 8 to 16 oz clam juice, and maybe a little extra Fish Sauce. 
  Many recipes use water from washing rice rather than plain water.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
  Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; Different cooks include different 
  vegetables, though Radish and Water Spinach are most common. Some 
  include chunks of Taro root or Eggplants, and some season with lots 
  of Garlic. Basically, though, keep it simple.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Miso:</h3> &nbsp; A major variation is to add Miso (Japanese 
  fermented soybean paste). A couple of tablespoons or considerably more 
  are used, depending on taste.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Saut&eacute;:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes saut&eacute; Garlic, Onions 
  and Tomatoes before adding the Soup Stock, then continue as above.</li>
