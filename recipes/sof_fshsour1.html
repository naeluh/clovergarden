A very popular soup in Vietnam, unique and delicious. It's pretty much 
standardized with little difference among recipes. There are special 
ingredients, but it's pretty easy to make. See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;(1 hr - includes 15 minutes to fillet 
  catfish)
  <ol>
  <li>Fillet <b>CATFISH</b> and cut into largish pieces.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> paste as needed 
    (see <a href="sof_fshsour1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Peel and cut into 
    chunks about 3/4 inches.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>OKRA</b> in 2 T <b>Vinegar</b> and keep them wet with 
    the vinegar for 20 minutes or more (this helps them hold together). 
    Rinse and cut into 3/4 inch segments.</li>
  <li>Peel off tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b>. Cut off the 
    hard root end and strike the bottom 5 inches lightly with the smooth 
    side of your kitchen mallet to crack it, but not hard enough so it 
    falls apart. Cut the bottom 5 inches into 2-1/2 inch lengths.</li>     
  <li>Cut <b>PINEAPPLE</b> into pieces about 1/4 inch thick and 3/4 inch 
    square.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>COLOCASIA STEMS</b> with a sharp vegetable peeler and cut 
    diagonally into 1 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise, slice thin and chop small.
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Stem <b>CHILI</b> and slice thin 
    crosswise. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PALM SUGAR</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>NGO OM</b> fairly small for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In your soup pot, combine <b>Tamarind Paste</b> and <b>Shallot 
    mix</b>. Fry over moderate heat for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Catfish</b> and tumble for about 3 minutes until evenly 
    coated. This is a sort of hot marinade. Remove with tongs and set 
    aside. Catfish will not be fully cooked at this time.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Pineapple</b> and 
    <b>Lemon Grass</b>. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, cover 
    and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Catfish</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b>, <b>Okra</b> and 
    <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until catfish is 
    cooked through.</li>
  <li>Stir in  <b>Colocasia Stems</b> and <b>Bean Sprouts</b>. Turn 
    off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Ngo Om</b> and <b>Fried Shallots</b>.  
    For buffet service I just stir in the Ngo Om and forget about the 
    Fried Shallots - well, most of the time I forget about the fried 
    shallots. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Vietnamese Catfish:</h3> &nbsp; [Basa, Swai, Tra] 
  Weight is for chunks the size you want in your soup. Preferably this 
  will be skin-on. The frozen fillets sold here are insipid in taste 
  due to the darker meat under the skin being removed. In Vietnam, 
  bone-in cross cut segments are used, but I generally need the chunks 
  smaller for buffet service. For this recipe I bought a gutted and 
  headless 2-1/2 pound frozen Swai and filleted it. The belly of this 
  fish   is very fatty and not used in dishes of this sort so the 
  ribcage is cut from the backbone and removed. If necessary, the 
  somewhat more earthy flavored American Channel Cat can be used. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/sf_catvnz.html"><b>Vietnamese 
  Catfish</b></a> and <a href="../ingred/sf_catz.html"><b>Catfish</b></a> 
  pages. There is also a version of this soup made with 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_snakehz.html"><b>Snakehead</b></a> fish.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Soaking pulp from a block 
  provides the best flavor. Use 3 T from the block, chop it, add hot 
  water to just cover and let it sit 20 minutes. Force it through 
  a wire strainer until only fibers remain, and scrape the paste off 
  the outside of the strainer. Second best is 3 T from a jar of 
  concentrate. For details and method, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select medium size or smaller Okras, because 
  larger ones tend to be fibrous.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for Southeast Asian cuisines, 
  these tough grass stems are now widely available in North America in 
  markets that serve an East or Southeast Asian community. I've even 
  seen them in some Korean markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Colocasia Stem:</h3> &nbsp; [Taro Stem] These are available in 
  most Asian markets, at least around here. Not actually Taro, but 
  closely related. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_colostmz.html"><b>Colocasia Stems</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One good hot Thai chili should be enough 
  for most people. I have used two, but consider that to be the maximum 
  for this soup, more would distract.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this 
  flavorful sugar, use another amber sugar such as Turbinado. Note that 
  I have cut the amount of sugar in half from the pattern recipes, and 
  this soup is still right on the edge of being too sweet for Western 
  tastes.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Ngo Om:</h3> &nbsp; [Rice Paddy Herb] This unique herb can be 
  found in the fresh herbs section of markets serving a Southeast Asian 
  community. For details see our <a href="../ingred/lm_ngoomz.html">
  <b>Ngo Om</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Fried Shallots:</h3> &nbsp; This is a really good garnish, but it 
  takes time and attention, and it's only good for a few days. I usually 
  settle for just the Ngo Om, but if you want the shallots, see our 
  recipe <a href="siv_shalfry1.html"><b>Fried Shallots</b></a>.</li>
