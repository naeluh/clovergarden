  <li>Fillet <b>SNAKEHEAD</b> and cut into largish bite size pieces. see 
    our <a href="../ingred/sf_snakehz.html"><b>Snakehead</b></a> page 
    for complete instructions.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Prepare <b>TAMARIND</b> paste as needed 
    (see <a href="sof_fshsour2.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Peel and cut into 
    chunks about 3/4 inches.</li>
  <li>Pinch root threads from <b>BEAN SPROUTS</b>. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>OKRA</b> into 3/4 inch segments.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PINEAPPLE</b> into pieces about 1/4 inch thick and 3/4 inch 
    square. Mix with Okra.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>COLOCASIA STEMS</b> with a sharp vegetable peeler and cut 
    into 3/4 inch lengths. Mix with Okra.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise, slice thin and chop small.
    Stem <b>CHILI</b> and slice thin crosswise. Mix both with Okra.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PALM SUGAR</b> if needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Garnish Herbs</b> (not including Fried Shallots) fairly 
    small. Use as many of these herbs as you can get.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In your soup pot, bring <b>Water</b> to a boil.  Stir in 
   <b>Snakehead</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer 5 minutes. Strain, 
   setting the Snakehead aside and returning liquid to the cleaned 
   pot.</li>
  <li>Bring Broth to a boil and stir in <b>Pineapple mix</b>. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b> and <b>Tamarind Pulp</b>. Bring to a 
    boil.</li> 
  <li>Return <b>Snakehead</b> to the pot. Stir in <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Palm Sugar</b>. Bring back to a Simmer for a minute.
  <li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Herb mix</b> and <b>Fried Shallots</b>.  
    For buffet service I just stir in the Herb mix and forget about the 
    Fried Shallots - well, most of the time I forget about the fried 
    shallots. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Snakehead / Mudfish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for chunks the size 
  you want in your soup, preferably skin-on. You will need twice this 
  weight in whole fish. This fish is very popular in southern China and 
  Southeast Asia, so can usually be found in Asian fish markets, most 
  often sold as "Mudfish". In Asia it is commonly sold live, but live 
  Snakehead is extremely illegal in California. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_snakehz.html"><b>Snakehead</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; Soaking pulp from a block provides the best 
  flavor. Use 3 T from the block, chop it, add hot water to cover it 
  well and let it sit 20 minutes. Force it through  a wire strainer until 
  only fibers remain - scrape the paste off the outside of the strainer. 
  Second best is 3 T from a jar of concentrate. For details and method, 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Okra:</h3> &nbsp; Select medium size or smaller Okras, because 
  larger ones tend to be fibrous.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Colocasia Stem:</h3> &nbsp; [Taro Stem] These are available in 
  most Asian markets, at least around here. Not actually Taro, but 
  closely related. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_colostmz.html"><b>Colocasia Stems</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Thai Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One good hot Thai chili should be enough 
  for most people. I have used two, but consider that to be the maximum 
  for this soup, more would distract. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this flavorful sugar, 
  use another amber sugar such as Turbinado.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Ngo Om:</h3> &nbsp; [Rice Paddy Herb] This unique herb can be 
  found in the fresh herbs section of markets serving a Southeast Asian 
  community. For details see our <a href="../ingred/lm_ngoomz.html">
  <b>Ngo Om</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Rau Ram:</h3> &nbsp; This is a very popular herb in Southeast Asia, 
  so is easily available in the produce section of Asian markets here in 
  Los Angeles. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_rauramz.html"><b>Rau Ram</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Fried Shallots:</h3> &nbsp; This is a really good garnish, but 
  it takes time and attention, and it's only good for a couple of days. 
  I usually settle for just the Ngo Om, but if you want the shallots, 
  see our recipe 
  <a href="siv_shalfry1.html"><b>Fried Shallots</b></a>.</li>
