This aromatic seafood soup is easy to make, and delicious. The seafood 
used can be varied, so long as it totals a pound, and sometimes a 
vegetable is added, such as slices of white bok choy stems with some 
of the greens.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into bite size pieces. Peel <b>SHRIMP</b> and 
    cut in half crosswise if quite large. Cut <b>SEAFOOD</b> into 
    appropriate size pieces. Mix.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> one minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into about 1/2 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> appropriately, if not using Straw Mushrooms.
    </li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Cap <b>CHILIS</b> and slice 
    thin crosswise. Peel off tough outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b>, 
    cut off the hard root end and crush the bottom 10 inches, but lightly, 
    so it doesn't fall apart. Cut into 3 inch lengths. Lightly bruise 
    <b>LIME LEAVES</b>. Slice <b>GALANGAL</b> about 1/8 inch thick. 
    Mix all.</li>     
  <li>Mix together all <b>Finish items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> medium for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In your soup pot, combine <b>Stock</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b> and 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 8 minutes or 
    so.</li>
  <li>If you wish, you can fish out the Lemon Grass, Lime Leaves and 
    Galangal at this point.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and bring to a boil. 
    Stir in <b>Seafood Mix</b> and bring back to a simmer for 2 to 3 
    minutes, until fish is just cooked through - longer and other 
    seafood may become tough. Live clams go in for the last 30 seconds 
    or so, just until they open.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Finish mix</b> and bring just up to a bare simmer, 
    not to a boil. It is now ready to serve.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Cilantro Leaves</b>. If you used 
    live clams, remove any that didn't open.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Many light to medium fish 
  that stay reasonably firm will work here as cooking time is very short. 
  Vietnamese Catfish (Swai), Tilapia, Bluefish, Pomfret, Pompano, Jacks 
  and Amberjacks, etc. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">Varieties of Fish</a> (very large 
  page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Seafood Mix:</h3> &nbsp; This can be any combination of Clam meat, 
  periwinkle meat, Squid, Squid Tentacles, Sea Cucumber, Mussel, 
  Scallops, Octopus (small), etc. If desired, you can also use some 
  small live clams, but don't count them in the weight (they are mostly 
  shell). The photo example has some small Purple Varnish Clams (Savory 
  clam).</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Straw mushrooms would be official, but 
  small King Trumpets also work fine. You could also use Crab Mushrooms, 
  Hon-Shimeji, or even fresh Shiitakes or regular White Mushrooms. For 
  details, see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Thai Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; As given here it is very low in chili 
  heat, but you can adjust it to your taste. Two Thai chilis give this 
  soup just moderate hotness. You could also use green de Arbols, or 
  about 2/3 of a Serrano, chopped small - or, adjust to your taste. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai 
  Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North America in markets that serve an East or Southeast 
  Asian community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html">
  <b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a stem. See 
  our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page 
  for details. If you don't have them, grate the zest of the lime 
  before you squeeze it for lime juice.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> The pattern recipe calls for Chicken stock, but Pork 
  Stock could also be used. In Asia, fish stocks are rarely used for 
  soups of this type.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
