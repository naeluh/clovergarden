  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water 1/2 hour. Drain, wring out 
    stem and slice 1/8 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Select a <b>LEMON GRASS</b> stalk, peel off the tough outer 
    leaves, cut off the hard root section and the tips leaving about 8 inches. 
    Crush it a bit with your kitchen mallet and cut into 3 lengths.</li>
  <li>Give the <b>LIME LEAVES</b> a few whacks with the pointy side of the 
    kitchen mallet to bruise them.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b> and split them half way down. Cut 
    <b>SCALLIONS</b> into 1 inch lengths and mix with Chilis.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>OPTIONS</b> as appropriate, into about 1/2 inch pieces if 
    large. Cut <b>FISH</b> into 1/2 inch pieces. Slice <b>FISH BALLS</b> 
    in half, then each half into three pieces, or IF using <b>TOFU</b> 
    cut into 1/2 inch dice. Mix all together.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Pick <b>CILANTRO</b> leaves off the stems. If desired, chop 
    coarse.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Heat <b>STOCK</b> and <b>WATER</b> to a simmer, Add

    Simmer 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add <b>FISH SAUCE</b> and <b>SOY SAUCE</b> and Simmer another 5 
    minutes.</li>

    a slotted spoon.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, Stir in <b>Chili mix</b> and <b>Options</b>. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer for only 2  minutes, or some options may 
    toughen. Finally turn off the heat and stir in the <b>Lime Juice</b>. 
    </li>
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Cilantro</b> leaves, and see 
    <a href="sof_seasour1.html#07"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3>  &nbsp;  Fresh Shiitake mushrooms work fine too, 
  but, do soak them in hot water for 20 minutes and wring them out - 
  This changes their texture from dry to creamy. Other Mushrooms could 
  also be used.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 leaves to a stem, so 
  this recipe needs 2 stems (unless one of the leaves on your 
  stems is very small). For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If 
  you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Balls:</h3> &nbsp; Half inch cubes of Firm Tofu, could also 
  be used, and was called for in the pattern recipe. I use Fish Balls 
  because I'm more likely to have some in the freeze than Firm Tofu 
  in the fridge.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Fish stock would come first to mind, but in 
  Southeast Asia Chicken or Pork stock could also be used, as matching 
  stock to ingredients isn't a rule there. These days, in Thailand, 
  these days, Chicken Powder or Bouillon Cubes might be used.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisines as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; You can also have a bowl of steamed Jasmine 
  Rice on the table, to be spooned into the soup as desired.</li>
