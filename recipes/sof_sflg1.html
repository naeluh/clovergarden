A simple to make seafood soup offering a good range of Southeast Asian 
flavors. It can be reheated with care - too long at a simmer will toughen 
some of the seafood. See also <a href="sof_sflg1.html#09"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;(35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Thaw <b>SEAFOOD MIX</b> or prepare your own mix as appropriate.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> thin (if Shiitakes see <a href="sof_sflg1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Peel off toughest outer leaves of <b>LEMON GRASS</b>. Cut off the 
    hard root end and strike the bottom 10 inches lightly with the smooth 
    side of your kitchen mallet to crack it, but not hard enough so it 
    falls apart. Cut the bottom 10 inches into 4 lengths.</li>    
  <li>Cut slices of <b>GALANGAL</b> about 1/8 inch thick. Bruise 
    <b>LIME LEAVES</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Broth items</b> in a suitable saucepan.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b></li>
  <li>For Garnish, cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> crosswise into 1/4 inch pieces 
    (white and green). Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Place the saucepan with the <b>Broth mix</b> on high flame and 
    bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Solids</b> from the broth and discard. There should be 
    at least 3 cups of broth left.</li>
  <li>Bring back to a boil and stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and 
    <b>Seasoning mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Return and stir in <b>Seafood mix</b>. Bring back to a boil 
    quickly and simmer for 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lime Juice</b> and immediately take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Scallion mix</b>. </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Seafood Mix:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after thawing 
  and draining. A good packaged frozen seafood mix will work fine - or 
  make up your own mix how you like.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 
  for fresh Shiitakes, which I used for the photo example, but some 
  of the new firm Oyster Mushrooms will work fine. If you use fresh 
  Shiitakes, give them a 20 minute soak in hot water as if they were 
  dried. This will make their texture creamy and improve flavor. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for Southeast Asian cuisines, 
  these tough grass stems are now widely available in North America in 
  markets that serve an East or Southeast Asian community. I've even seen 
  them in some Korean markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemongrass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Galangal</h3> &nbsp; This board hard relative of ginger imparts 
  a unique flavor to Southeast Asian soups and stews. Fresh is best but 
  frozen is fine. Dried and powdered is not acceptable. If you don't 
  have it, use fresh Ginger Root - not at all the same, but acceptable. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html">
  <b>Galangal</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a 
  stem, so this recipe will need 2 stems. For details See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page. If you 
  don't have them, grate the zest of a lime before you squeeze 
  it for lime juice.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3>> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia the stock is not necessarily 
  keyed to the main ingredient, so either a Fish Stock or Chicken Stock 
  can be used, or even Pork Stock.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Chili Garlic Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; The almost universally available 
  Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce (Green cap, Rooster logo) will do fine 
  here.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was given as Lao, by a 
  writer who is definitely Lao, but beyond the spelling of "Thome" for 
  "Tom", this soup is actually Thai. Laos has no natural access to 
  seafood, only to river fish. On the other hand, Thailand and Laos 
  share a lot of their cuisine with each other, and a large number of 
  Laotians live in Thailand.</li>
