Delicous! An authentic Shark Fin Soup, except no actual Sharks were harmed. 
Using real Shark Fin is a criminal offense in all civilized societies.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;(2 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>First catch your Shark - <u>NO</u>! Don't do that! See <a href="sof_sharkf1.html#10">
    <b>Comments</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>"SHARK FIN"</b> in cool Water until very flexible. Sweet Potato 
    Noodles will take over an hour, Bean Threads, 10 minutes. Real Shark Fin 
    takes 3 hrs plus simmering in several changes of water.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>"Shark Fin"</b>. Spread out on your cutting board and cut so 
    the pieces are about 1 inches long. Longer and they just will not stay in 
    the spoon when eating.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> and <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in warm water for at least 
    1-1/2 hours. Stem <b>Mushrooms</b>, cut in half, then slice quite thin. 
    Remove hard attachment points from the <b>Black Fungus</b> and tear into 
    small shreds. Mix <b>Water Chestnut Starch</b> with 3 Tablespoons 
    <b>Water</b> to make a slurry (or 3 Tablespoons Cornstarch and 4 
    Tablespoons Water).
    </li>
  <li>Beat <b>Egg</b> moderately.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> coarse for Garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a large sauce pan, combine <b>Stock</b> and <b>Water</b>. Add 
    <b>Scallops</b> and <b>Chicken</b>. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 
    covered for 1 hour.</li> 
  <li>Fish out <b>Scallops</b> and <b>Chicken</b>. Shred them small and 
    return to the pan, along with the drained <b>Mushrooms</b>. Add 
    <b>Rice Wine</b> and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Bring to a simmer and simmer 
    covered for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b>, and <b>Dark Soy Sauce</b>. Stir 
    up <b>Water Chestnut slurry</b> and stir in. Bring back to a simmer 
    stirring for a minute to let the starch thicken the soup.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>"Shark Fin"</b> and simmer a minute for Bean Threads, about 
    3 minutes for Sweet Potato Noodles.</li>
  <li>Holding at a bare simmer, slowly pour in the <b>Egg</b> while stirring 
    gently in one direction, as for making Egg Drop Soup.</li> 
  <li>Serve in individual bowls, scooping up from the bottom as the "Shark 
    Fin" will tend to sink while the mushrooms will tend to float. Finish 
    with a few drops of <b>Sesame Oil</b> and a dash of <b>Black Vinegar</b> 
    per bowl (1/4 t / cup). Garnish with <b>Cilantro Leaves</b>. See also

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>"Shark Fin":</h3> &nbsp; Real Shark Fin is highly illegal in California, 
  Hawaii, New York, and other relatively civilized regions. The given weight 
  is for "Glass Noodles" (Bean Threads, or better, Korean Sweet Potato 
  Noodles). The photo example was made with Sweet Potato Noodles. For options 
  and further information, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_shrkfa.html">
  <b>Shark Fin - Real &amp; Artificial</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the dried Shiitakes available 
  just about everywhere. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; [Wood Ear, Cloud Ear, Tree Ear] &nbsp; 
  These are available in just about any Asian market. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Scallops, Dry:</h3> &nbsp; These are an expensive item and can be hard 
  to find, except on the Internet. A pattern recipe called for "10 scallops 
  (dried)", as if Scallops are all the same size. I couldn't tell for sure 
  from her photo, but I'm presuming 2G size, or 20 grams total, as 2G is a 
  popular size. Other flavorings could be used, such as dried fish or dried 
  shrimp. One recipe suggests 1 Tablespoon of Oyster Sauce, or a clear Fish 
  Sauce could be used. For details, see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdshell.html#scald"><b>Shellfish Products</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chicken Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Use Thigh or Leg meat as they have much better 
  flavor and texture than Breast meat.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good drinkable Rice Wine, not that 
  horrid salted "cooking wine". If you don't have it, use a dry Sherry. 
  Sake is made of rice but not considered a good substitute, it's beer, 
  not wine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html">
  <b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="07">
  <h3>Water Chestnut Starch:</h3> &nbsp; This starch is preferred because it 
  leaves the soup very clear, very important in fancy restaurants. If you 
  don't have it you can use about twice as much Corn Starch with some 
  reduction in clarity.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; The Chinese are distressed by tiny black dots in 
  their food, so they always specify White Pepper. I usually use the more 
  flavorful Black Pepper anyway (I'm not Chinese).</li>
<li id="9">
  <h3>Vinegar, Black:</h3> &nbsp; [Chinkiang Vinegar] This is a dark 
  rice vinegar, popular in Southern China. Best is from Chinkiang 
  (Zhejiang). For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html#china">
  <b>Vinegars &amp; Souring Agents</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; At Chinese banquets, this soup is usually served 
  in small bowls as an appetizer. The Black Vinegar is sometimes set out on 
  the table to be added as desired.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; A lady in Singapore, saying she only cooked shark 
  fin soup once a year due to the expense, described finding a package of 
  recipe ready shark fin with some other soup ingredients included. She 
  wrote up her recipe on her blog. Talk about getting raked over the coals 
  in the comments, yes indeed! The sharks have friends.</li>
