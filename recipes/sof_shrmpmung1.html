An easy to make soup with interesting Asian flavors and textures. Mung 
bean noodles don't get mushy so this soup is easy to hold and re-warms 
well.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BEAN THREADS</b> in warm water for 1/2 hour, drain. Pile them

    the pieces are 1-1/2 to 2 inches long. You should have about 1 cup.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK FUNGUS</b> in warm water for 1/2 hour. Pinch off any 
    hard attachment points and tear into convenient pieces. You should have 
    about 2 ounces.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SHRIMP</b> or leave them whole depending on size and your 
    preference.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Pork</b> fairly thin and cut into small pieces.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO STEMS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.

    raw color, then stir in <b>Shrimp</b> for 2 minutes.</li>

    <b>Black Fungus</b> stirring until well mixed. Stir in remaining

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bean Threads:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as Glass Noodles and Mung Bean 
  Noodles.  Don't confuse them with rice sticks which look the same 
  dried. Their cooking properties are very different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_asia.html"><b>Asian Noodles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Fungus:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as Wood Ears, Cloud Ears, 
  Tree Ears and other names. Weight given here is before soaking. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fu_blackz.html"><b>Black 
  Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro Stems:</h3> &nbsp; Actually this should be 1/2 T of 
  Cilantro Roots, but those are hard to get even here in Los Angeles. 
  Include no leaves.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Pork is fine. Use an unsalted stock 
  and add no salt as the fish sauce provides plenty.</li>
