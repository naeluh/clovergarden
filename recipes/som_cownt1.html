This soup presents an intense complex of interesting flavors that will 
be unfamiliar to most Americans, quite different from the Thai 
"standards". Chili heat is distinct, but not overwhelming.

This recipe 
takes some shopping and some pre-prep (see <a href="som_cownt1.html#12">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min &nbsp; (exclusive of chili 
    flake and shrimp paste))
  <ol>
  <li>Make your Toasted Chili Flake (<a href="siv_cptstd1.html"><b>Prik 
    Phon Khua</b></a>) and Shrimp Paste (<a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sif_kapikung1.html">
    <b>Kapi Kung</b></a>) if you don't have them on hand.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF</b> of any excess fat. Cut across the grain about 
    1/4 inch thick, then into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches 
    long - or whatever you like or whatever works with your hunk of 
    beef.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Beef</b> in a pot with plenty of water to cover. Bring 
    to a rolling boil for about 1 minute. Dump it all out into a 
    clean sink. Wash the pot. Rinse the <b>Beef</b> and set it aside 
    (this is to keep your soup fairly clear).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> lengthwise into wedges about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Seasoning Paste</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min)
  <ol start="5"> 
  <li>Prep these items and smash to paste in a big granite mortar <u>in 
    the order given here</u> - hardest first, stickiest last - BUT, do 
    read <a href="som_cownt1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a> for hints on how to make it 
    easier. Prep <b>LEMON GRASS</b> per <a href="som_cownt1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>. 
    Peel <b>GALANGAL</b> and slice as thin as you can get it, then slice 
    into small pieces. Peel <b>TURMERIC</b> and slice thin. 
    Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise, then slice thin crosswise. 
    Crush <b>GARLIC</b> in your Garlic Press and chop to break up 
    fibers.</li>
  <li>Break <b>PUYA CHILIS</b> and pour out seeds. Discard stems and 
    caps. Run them to small flake in your Mini-prep Food Processor or 
    Spice Grinder. Mix into the <b>Paste</b></li>
  <li>Mix <b>Kapi Kung</b> into <b>Paste</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a pot, put 8 cups of cold water. Stir in <b>Seasoning Paste</b> 
    <b>Soy Sauce</b> and <b>Toasted Chili Flake</b> Bring to a strong 
    simmer.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Beef</b> and bring back to a strong simmer. Cover 
    tightly, turn down to a low simmer and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and continue to simmer until Beef is tender, 
    another 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Tear up Kaffir Lime Leaves (not too small) 
    and crush them lightly to release flavor.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> coarse, Slice <b>Culantro</b> thin. Slice 
    <b>Scallions</b> thin. Mix all (measures are all lightly packed 
    after chopping).</li>
  <li>When <b>Beef</b> is done: stir in <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and 
    <b>Kaffir Lime Leaves</b>. Simmer for a couple minutes and turn off 
    the heat. Allow to cool just slightly.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, liberally sprinkle <b>Herb Mix</b> over and 
    serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Tougher cuts are fine here - in Northern 
  Thailand, Buffalo or Oxen too old to work the fields end up in the 
  soup pot.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; You'll need about 3 good size stalks. 
  Peel off hard outer layers - the last layer you pull off should be 
  distinctly purple on the inside. Cut off exposed core. With your 
  kitchen mallet smash the bottom 5 inches well (a slug of hard core 
  will be ejected). Slice crosswise as thin as you can manage. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html">
  <b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; This member of the Ginger family is available 
  from markets serving a Southeast Asian community. It is an essential 
  ingredient, and can be found fresh or frozen. It is very hard. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gg_galangz.html"><b>Galangal</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Turmeric:</h3> &nbsp; This member of the Ginger family is 
  available, fresh or frozen, from markets serving a Southeast Asian 
  or Indian community. You want the yellow version, not the white. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gg_turmerz.html"><b>Turmeric</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Puya Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; These are a substitute for unavailable 
  Thai Prik Kaeng dried red chilis. They are available from some markets 
  serving a Mexican community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Kapi Kung</h3> This is the shrimp paste of northern Thailand. It is 
  not currently available in North America and must be faked up. See our 
  recipe <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sif_kapikung1.html"><b>Thai Shrimp Paste - 
  Northern</b></a>.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Soy Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably this will be light Thai Soy 
  Sauce, which is a little different from Japanese.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Prik Phon Khua:</h3> &nbsp; This is Puya chilis (substitute for 
  Prik Kaeng) very slowly toasted until nearly black and with a smoky 
  aroma. You can make it per our recipe 
  <a href="siv_cptstd1.html"><b>Toasted Chili Flake</b></a>.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; Fortunately, this very important 
  ingredient is becoming much more available from markets serving a 
  Southeast Asian Community. Strangely, they come 2 leaves to a stem. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir 
  Lime</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Culantro:</h3> &nbsp; [Saw Tooth Herb (Southeast Asia)] &nbsp; 
  This herb is native to Mexico and South America, but is now used 
  throughout Southeast Asia. It can be found in markets serving a 
  Southeast Asian or Caribbean community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; I am strong and in good health, but I am not 
  Hercules, so I have made changes in procedure that greatly reduce 
  pounding in a big granite mortar with a 3 pound pestle. Unfortunately, 
  no machinery available in even a well equipped kitchen can produce 
  the results of pounding in a mortar, so a fair amount of pounding is 
  still needed - just not as heroic an amount.
  <ol>
  <li>Prep all <b>Seasoning Paste items</b> as given above, as if you 
    were going to pound them in the mortar.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>Lemon Grass</b> in a mini-prep food processor until it 
    is as fine as it will get. Add <b>Galangal</b> and process until it 
    is as fine as it will get. Add <b>Turmeric</b> and process until it 
    is as fine as you can get it.</li>
  <li>The contents of the mini-prep will now be rather sticky due to 
    the Turmeric, so empty the contents into the mortar and give it a 
    good pounding.</li> 
  <li>Since the mini-prep already needs cleaning, go ahead and run the 
    <b>Shallots</b> in it, then transfer them to the mortar.</li>
  <li>Add the crushed and chopped <b>Garlic</b> to the mortar, and 
    pound everything as best you have stamina for.</li>
  <li>Stir in the ground <b>Puya Chilis</b> and <b>Kapi Kung</b>. 
    Pound some more until everything is evenly mixed.</li>
    </ol>
  The pattern recipe has you soak the Chilis and pound them in the 
  mortar. I've done enough Mexican cooking to know this takes a lot of 
  pounding, because the skins are tough - so I always just grind 
  chilis dry - it works fine.</li>
<li id="12">
  <h3>Preparation:</h3> &nbsp; The final "Run" step takes little 
  attention, but some of the preparation is more involved and best done 
  well in advance.  The Prik Phon Khua and Kapi Kung are pretty easy and 
  can be done when you have time, even weeks in advance. The "Seasoning 
  Paste" is most of the work, and is best done a day or two in advance 
  and refrigerated until needed.</li>
