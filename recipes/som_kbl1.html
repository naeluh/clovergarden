This popular, easy to make soup presents a fine palette of flavors and 
textures. You have to do a little shopping, but don't let all those notes 
intimidate you (reading them will make things easier).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pigeon Peas:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for fresh, frozen or dry peas 
  soaked overnight. Dry is probably what you're going to be able to get
  in most regions. You will need about 3/4 cup of dried peas to make 
  1-1/2 cups soaked. In the Philippines, purple Pigeon Peas are preferred 
  for this soup, but I haven't seen that color in North America. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_pigeonz.html">
  <b>Pigeon Peas</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Hocks:</h3> &nbsp; These are fresh, unsmoked hocks. 2 
  pounds presumes meaty hocks, bone in, skin on. I remove the skin for 
  another use (see <a href="som_kbl1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a>. The pattern recipe 
  served hocks on the bone, but the ones we get here in Southern 
  California are a bit large for that.</li>
<li id="03"><b>Baby Jackfruit:</b> &nbsp; You'll be hard pressed to 
  find fresh Baby Jackfruit in North America, even here in Los Angeles. 
  The Philippine markets (and some other Asian markets) often have it in 
  the frozen food cases. A 1 pound frozen package will yield 9 ounces 
  thawed. For details see our <a href="../ingred/mb_jackrz.html">
  <b>Unripe Jackfruit</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; If your Tamarind is concentrate in a jar, 
  use 1/4 c, or if it's block use about 1/4 c, soak it in 1-1/2 cups 
  hot water for at least 30 minutes. Strain, pressing the pulp to force 
  as much through as will go. If you don't have tamarind use 2 t lemon 
  juice - not the same, but it's something. For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>"Yam" Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These are actually Sweet Potato Leaves, 
  but sold in Philippine markets in California as "Yam Leaves". This is 
  by the convention that all colored sweet potatoes are called "Yams" 
  here, even though they aren't real Yams. Real Yam Leaves are not 
  considered very edible. If you can't get Sweet Potato Leaves, use 
  Chard, or some other not-too-tart leaf that holds up to cooking. You 
  will need 3/4 pounds of stem-on Sweet Potato Leaves to make 1 cup with 
  the stems removed.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Pork or Chicken stock will work fine. In the 
  tropical Philippines, having stock on hand is not traditional so 
  Filipinos usually use bouillon cubes or granules in plain water. Feel 
  free to do that if you wish.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh pork hocks are almost always "skin on". 
  I don't use the skins in this soup, but I'd <u>never</u> discard them. 
  I simmer them in stock or water for about 1/2 hour, slice them up and 
  eat them with a dip of salt and my favorite Philippine vinegar. 
  Tamarind is not the "official" souring agent, that is 5 fresh Batuan 
  (Gambooge) fruits. This is an exotic fruit you will not likely find in 
  North America (see our <a href="../ingred/cl_mangost.html">
  <b>Mangosteen</b></a> page). Lacking that, the pattern recipe used 
  1-1/2 Tablespoons of Sinigang powder, which is predominantly powdered 
  Tamarind. I prefer to use a sweet/sour fruit to replace a sweet/sour 
  fruit, so I use Tamarind Paste.</li>
