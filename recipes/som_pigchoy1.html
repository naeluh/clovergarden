An outstandingly delicious soup!  While Burmese Sour Soups are made with 
Fish in Burma, this one from the Karen people of Kayan State is 
based on Pork. It has no chili heat (unless you want it to).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin. Cut slices into pieces roughly 1 x 3/4 
    inch.</li>
  <li>Rub all <b>Marinade items</b> into <b>Pork</b> well and evenly. 
    Set aside for at least 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TAMARIND PASTE</b> as well as you can. Place in a heat 
    proof bowl and pour in <b>Boiling Water</b>. Let soak for at least 
    20 minutes. Force it through a wire strainer keeping liquid and 
    pulp that passes through. Be sure to scrape off the paste that 
    adheres to the outside of the strainer. Discard fibrous debris.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Shrimp Paste</b> with 1/4 c <b>Water</b> and stir until 
    dissolved.</li>
  <li>Wash and trim <b>CHOY</b> of choice. Slice coarse. You should end 
    up with about 3 cups moderately packed.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise, peel and slice thin 
    crosswise. Slice <b>Ginger</b> very thin crosswise, then chop fine. 
    Peel tough outer leaves from <b>LEMON GRASS</b> and cut off hard 
    root end. lightly crush the bottom 4 inches with your kitchen mallet, 
    and cut the 6 inches into two 3 inches pieces. Mix all 
    <b>Aromatics items</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot, heat <b>Oil</b> over moderately high 
    heat. Toss in 1/8 t <b>Turmeric</b>, and a second later stir in the 
    <b>Aromatics mix</b>. Fry stirring until Shallots are translucent.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and fry stirring until all raw color is gone.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Shrimp Paste mix</b>. Bring to a boil 
    and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>     
  <li>Stir in <b>Tamarind liquid</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring back to a 
    boil, then stir in <b>CHOY</b>. Again return to a boil and simmer 
    until the Choy stem slices are just tender.</li>
  <li>Check Salt and adjust if needed. Serve hot accompanied with plenty 
    of steamed Jasmine rice (see <a href="som_pigchoy1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for pork meat with excess 
  fat removed. Just about any cut will do.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tamarind:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe presumes block form (best). 
  Concentrate could also be used. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Use a Thai version. I prefer the paste 
  without Soy Oil, though its harder to find. For versions and details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauce / 
  Paste</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Choy:</h3> &nbsp; Practically any vegetable called "Choy" can be 
  used. The photo example is made with Shanghai Bok Choy (called "baby 
  bok choy" in markets). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, Turnip &amp; 
  Radish Greens</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Vegetable, Chicken 
  or plain Water. Actually, Pork stock will also work fine, but even if 
  you don't have stock ready, there's no need to use plain water. 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Powder</b></a> is now 
  much used in Asia as many modern families no longer have a stay-at-home 
  cook, and it is easily available in North America.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia it is common practice to 
  serve soups in a central bowl to be spooned over your rice. In North 
  America, I find it much more satisfactory to provide a bowl of rice 
  with a spoon at the table. Diners can add spoons full of rice to their 
  soup as desired. This method has also been suggested by other cooks.
