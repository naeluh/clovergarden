Pak Bung (Ong Choy) is very popular in Asian communities. It's illegal 
in many states but is widely available here in California. This popular 
recipe is traditional and allows little variation, but we've had 
to make one substitution.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs (enough for many 
    recipes))
  <ol>
  <li>Make <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html"><b>Red Curry Paste</b></a> if 
    you don't have it on hand.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
  <li>If your <b>PAK BUNG</b> is very fresh you can just break off any 
    stems larger than 1/4 inch and cut the whole bunch to 1 inch lengths. 
    If not, you'll have to pick through it stem by stem, discarding large 
    stems and wilted or damaged leaves.</li>
  <li>Open <b>Coconut Milk</b> without shaking the can. Spoon 3 ounces off 
    the top into a 2 quart sauce pan, taking all the thick milk. Stir in 
    the <b>Curry Paste</b>. Simmer slowly, stirring constantly, until the 
    red oil starts to separate.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> until well coated with the curry, then stir in 
    <b>Pak Bung</b>, the other 5 oz <b>Coconut Milk</b> and the 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and stir in the <b>Fish Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Sugar</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LIME JUICE</b>. Crumple <b>LIME LEAVES</b> to release 
    their flavor. Add both to the soup.</li>
  <li>Simmer slowly for 20 to 45 minutes (longer the better).</li>
  <li>Check balance and adjust if needed. Of the fish sauce, sugar and 
    lime juice, none should dominate. Add more of any one that seems 
    lacking.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with plenty of steamed Jasmine rice. This dish is always 
    served with rice - you might want to pour soup in a bowl and then add 
    a liberal scoop of rice. The finished soup reheats very well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally this is made from pork belly, but 
  in these sedentary times you may want to use lean pork. I have 
  specified about twice as much pork as in the pattern recipe - see 
  <a href="../regions/adopt.html"><b>Western Adoption of Asian 
  Food</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; It's legal in California but 
  contraband in some other states. In Thailand they use a stemmier 
  short leaf variety, but the California Department of Agriculture 
  frowns on that one - it has to be grown in water so could escape 
  into the waterways and irrigation systems. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Curry Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the 
  most popular of the Thai curry pastes. It is sold commercially, but is 
  better made at home. For recipe see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/sis_redcurry1.html">
  <b>Red Curry Paste</b></a>. "Red Curry Sauce" is not acceptable.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this use turbinado or a 
  similar lightly refined sugar.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lime:</h3> &nbsp; In Thailand this would be Kaffir Limes, but those 
  are very hard to find in North America unless you have your own tree 
  (mine is setting a good crop again this year), so you'll probably need 
  to use a regular Persian lime. Some recipes say to drop the rind in 
  after squeezing. That probably works better with Kaffir limes, Persian 
  rinds make the soup a bit bitter. Kaffir limes are rather dry, so you'd 
  probably need juice from a couple of them.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; These come 2 to a stem. See our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html">Kaffir Lime</a> page for details. 
  If you don't have them, grate the zest of the limes before you squeeze 
  them for lime juice.</li>
