A simple soup, but substantial enough to be a light supper - probably not 100% 
Singaporian though, see <a href="som_pigrbcn1.html#06"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>SPARE RIBS</b> and chop into lengths no more than 2 
    inches (a razor sharp Chinese cleaver driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is perfect for this). Put them in a pot, cover with plenty of water 
    and bring to a rolling boil for about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse the 
    ribs and wash the pot.</li>
  <li>Soak the <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for about 1/2 hour. Stem, 
    cut caps in half, then cut at right angles about 1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b>. Slice on a diagonal about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Open <b>CORN</b> and drain.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Put <b>Spare Ribs</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b> in a large saucepan with 5 c 
    <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Carrots</b> and simmer another 20 minutes or until they are 
    tender.</li>
  <li>When Carrots are ready, Stir in <b>Corn</b> and all <b>Seasoning 
    items</b>. Bring to a boil and turn off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot in individual bowls, a few ribs and some Carrots in each. 
    When serving, scoop deep, because the Corn Kernels go straight to the 
    bottom.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat trimmed off. 
  I prefer the parts with a lot of cartilage rather than bone for this recipe. 
  The long cooking will make the cartilage easily edible, and do eat it, 
  it's good for joints and such.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; Also called "Forest Mushroom", these  
  are actually dried shiitakes. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page. Some would have you add the soaking liquid to the stock but I 
  consider that a bit overpowering - your choice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Corn:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe used 2 whole cobs of fresh corn, 
  then cooked them (and the Carrots) to death. Well, she's based in England.
  One can of corn equals 2 US cobs, and it works fine. Yes, they have sweet 
  corn in Southeast Asia - it's popular even in Indonesia.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Steamed Jasmine Rice would be most appropriate. In 
  Asia, they would have a bowl of rice for each person. and some of the 
  soup would be labeled over the rice. For Euro-Americans, it's much more 
  convenient to serve the soup in a bowl for each person, and place a 
  bowl of Steamed Rice on the table to be spooned into the soup as desired.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is by an expert in Singapore 
  cooking, but she was born and raised in England, and makes this soup from 
  English farm produce. As common with other English cookbooks, she doesn't 
  bother to give recipe names in their native languages, so it's hard to say 
  if this one is truly Singaporian, even though her book is subtitled "Recipes 
  from the Heart of Singapore". In any case, I've added a couple items common 
  to other Southeast Asian pork rib soups, the Mushrooms and Fish Sauce. I've 
  also increased the Carrots, because I like carrots. From all this I flag 
  this recipe "Singapore, England, and California" without apologies.</li>
