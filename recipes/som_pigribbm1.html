  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate <b>SPARE RIBS</b> and chop into lengths no more than 2 
    inches (a razor sharp Chinese cleaver driven by a soft faced mallet 
    is perfect for this). Put them in a pot, cover with plenty of water 
    and bring to a rolling boil for about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse the 
    ribs and wash the pot.</li>
  <li>Soak the <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for about 1/2 hour. Stem and 
   quarter them. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BITTER MELONS</b> lengthwise into quarters, remove the seed 
    mass and then cut them crosswise into peices about 1 inch long.</li>
  <li>Cursh <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Spare Ribs</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b> and <b>Garlic</b> in a soup 
    pot with 6 c <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Add <b>Bitter Melon</b> and simmer another 15 minutes or until 
    melon is tender.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in <b>Soy Sauce</b> and 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b>, bring to a boil and turn off heat.</li>
  <li>Serve in individual bowls, a few ribs, some melon and mushrooms.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Spare Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all excess fat trimmed off. 
  I prefer the parts with a lot of cartilage rather than bone for this 
  long cooking recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Black Mushroom:</h3> &nbsp; Also called "Forest Mushroom", these  
  are actually dried shiitakis. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fu_shiitz.html"><b>Shiitake Mushrooms</b></a> 
  page. Some would have you add the soaking liquid to the stock but I 
  consider that a bit overpowering - your choice.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bitter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; [Bitter Gourd] &nbsp; Use the smoother 
  Chinese variety and select dark green ones about 6 inches long. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/gd_bittz.html">
  <b>Bitter Melon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In much of Asia, developing a taste for 
  bitter melon is considered a rite of passage into adulthood. It really 
  isn't hard, except for those so-called "super tasters" who just can't  
  stand bitter. This recipe is my derivation, working from several Thai 
  recipes.</li>
