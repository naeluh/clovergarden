This amazing soup/stew from the Shan people is "sweet-sour", but the 
sweet comes not from sugar, but from Shallots and Garlic. It 
is entirely delicious!

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK BELLY</b> into sticks about 3/8 x 3/8 or 1/2 x 1/2 inch 
    square and the length the slab is thick (or the width of the slices). 
    Each stick should have skin on the end.</li>
  <li>Remove hard outer leave of <b>LEMON GRASS</b> stalks. Cut off 
    hard root end. Bruise the bottom 6 inches of each with your 
    kitchen mallet, then cut the bruised section into 2 inch pieces. 
    Discard the top section.</li>
  <li>Quarter (or half if small) <b>SHALLOTS</b> and peel. Peel 
    <b>GARLIC</b>. If large, cut cloves in half lengthwise. Mix 
    (measures are after peeling and cutting).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a 3 quart pot, bring <b>WATER</b> to a boil. Stir in 
    <b>Pork belly</b>, <b>Turmeric</b>, <b>Lemongrass</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Bring back to a boil and hold at a slow boil 
    until Pork is done, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Shallot mix</b>. Bring back to a boil and hold at 
    a slow boil for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Souring Agent</b>, 2 minutes for Lime Juice, 10 
    minutes for others.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork belly:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, it has some fat, 
  but, in case you haven't heard, the "low fat diet" has been entirely 
  discredited as a successful marketing campaign by the sugar industry - 
  so - enjoy! Pork Belly is readily available in East and Southeast 
  Asian markets. It may be sold as a slab or may be sliced but should 
  not be sliced thinner than about 3/8 inch and should be skin-on. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_bellyz.html"><b>Pork 
  Belly</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemongrass:</h3> &nbsp; These tough grass stems 
  are now widely available in North American markets that serve a
  Southeast Asian community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Souring:</h3> &nbsp; The Shan would most often 
  use 1 cup <a href="../ingred/mw_kenafz.html#rosel"><b>Roselle 
  Pods</b></a>, but these are imperfectly available in North America. 
  Suggested substitutes are 1/2 cup lime juice (easiest, and what I use) 
  or 1 cup of chopped Green (unripe) Tomatoes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Asia, soups like this would be served in a 
  central tureen. Each diner would ladle some out into his or her bowl of 
  rice. For Western service, I find it much more practical to serve the 
  soup in individual bowls and the rice on the table in a central bowl, 
  to be spooned into the soup as diners desire. I have found some other 
  cooks also recommend this method.</li>
