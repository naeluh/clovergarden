  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak cleaned <b>PORK STOMACH</b> in a couple changes of salted 
    water acidulated with citric acid or lemon juice. Then put it a pot 
    with water to cover and bring to a boil for 15 minutes. Pour out, 
    rinse, and clean the pot. Put the Pork Stomach back into the pot, 
    cover with fresh water and add some Scallions and slices of Ginger. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer until al dente - about 1 hours. It'll 
    still be a bit chewy, that's its nature, but cooking much longer 
    the layers will start to separate and it'll be messy. Rinse and 
    discard cooking water.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Put <b>CODONOPSIS ROOT</b> in a bowl of warm water and leave to soak 
    for about 1-1/2 hours to soften enough to slice.</li>
  <li>Put <b>WOLFBERRIES</b> in a cup of warm water and soak for about 
    1/2 hour.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Pork Stomach</b> into strips about 3/8 inch wide by 1-1/2 
    inches long. Slice <b>Codonopsis</b> crosswise quite thin - it'll 
    expand when cooked. Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into pieces about 3/4 x 3/4 
    x 1-1/2 inches. Cut <b>PORK BELLY</b> crosswise about 1/2 x 1/2 x 1 
    inch. Slice <b>GINGER</b> thin.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Put <b>All Prepared Items</b> in a pot with 7 cups of <b>Water</b>, 
    bring to a boil and simmer covered for about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour through a strainer to separate stock from solids. Defat the 
    stock using your gravy separator. Return liquids and solids to the 
    pot.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Celery</b> small and add to pot along with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Serve hot. You can provide <b>Chili Garlic Sauce</b> for anyone 
    who'd like to spice it up a bit.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Stomach</h3> &nbsp; This can be found in Asian markets that 
  have good meat department, or from some Eastern European and Central 
  and South American markets. If you can't get it substitute 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Blanket Tripe</b></a> - 
  milder but it'll do. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_stomz.html"><b>Pig Stomach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Codonopsis</h3> &nbsp; This is a variety of bellflower the 
  dried roots of which can be found in Asian markets, particularly those 
  serving a Korean or Chinese community. Closest substitute would be 
  celery root - different flavor but similar texture. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bellflower.html"><b>Bellflower</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Wolfberries</h3> &nbsp; These are found in practically any East or 
  Southeast Asian market, sometimes under the name Goji or Fructus Lycii. 
  If you can't get them substitute dried cranberries and maybe a little 
  sun dried tomato. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_wolfbz.html"><b>Wolfberry</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pork Belly</h3> &nbsp; Also known as "uncured bacon" this is 
  easily found in most ethnic markets (except Jewish and Muslim). It 
  may be cut into cubes or into bacon-like slices. If sliced, the slices 
  should be at least 3/8 inch thick. Either way It will probably have the 
  skin still on - leave it on.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Celery</h3> &nbsp; This should properly be Chinese celery which 
  has thinner stems and a stronger flavor than Western celery. If you 
  have only regular celery cut from the above the first joint where 
  the flavor is strongest.</li>
