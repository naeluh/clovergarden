This soup is related to the winter melon soups of China. Vietnamese are 
very big on fresh herbs, so don't be afraid to add other herbs at the 
table. They also often use dried tiger lily buds in the stock.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>WINTER MELON</b> with your regular vegetable peeler, scrape 
    out the seed mass and cut into chunks about 3/4 to 1 inch on a side.
    </li>
  <li>Separate <b>PORK RIBS</b>. Remove as much fat as possible and cut 
    them into 1 inch lengths. A sharp Chinese cleaver knife driven by a 
    soft faced mallet is perfect for this.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Pork Ribs</b> in a pot with plenty of water. Bring to a rapid 
    boil for about 1 minute. Pour out into the sink. Wash the pot, rinse 
    the pork pieces to remove all sludge and return them to the pot.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GINGER</b> moderately with your kitchen mallet. Peel 
    <b>Onion</b> and cut lengthwise into quarters, leaving the root end 
    to hold it together. Toss both in the pot with the pork. Also see 
    <a href="som_wintermelon1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Add 6 cups <b>Water</b> to the pan and bring to a boil. Simmer for 
    about 1-3/4 hours.</li>
  <li>Fish out and discard <b>Onion</b> and <b>Ginger</b>.  Stir in 
    <b>Winter Melon</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a 
    simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Ladle into serving bowels. Garnished with thin rings of the green 
    part of <b>SCALLIONS</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Winter Melon:</h3> &nbsp; These are available, usually as large 
  wedges or slices, in just about any market serving an East or Southeast 
  Asian community, and sometimes in Indian markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gd_ashz.html"><b>Ash Gourd</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pork Ribs:</h3> &nbsp; Use pork spare ribs. Because of the long 
  cooking the cartilaginous parts are fine for this recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Variation:</h3> &nbsp; Some Vietnamese lightly char the cut onion 
  and ginger to enhance the flavor.</li>
