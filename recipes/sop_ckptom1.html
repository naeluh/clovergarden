A substantial and flavorful vegetarian soup, easy to make. The photo 
example is my usual version, but it can be made mercilessly rustic 
using Kala Chana (see <a href="sop_ckptom1x.html#rustic"><b>
Photo</b></a>), or more refined (see <a href="sop_ckptom1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>).

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 hrs - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>CHICKPEAS</b> in plenty of water and 1/2 T <b>Salt</b> 
    (yes, salt) 8 hours or overnight.</li>
  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Chickpeas</b>. Place in a saucepan with plenty 
    of water and bring to a boil uncovered. Cover and simmer for about 
    1-1/2 hours or until tender. If using Kala Chana maybe about 2 
    hours. Drain.</li>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Smash cooked <b>Chickpeas</b> - most well smashed, some medium 
    and a few lightly smashed. It is permissible to use a processor 
    for the well smashed ones.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water, quench in 
    cold water. Peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Peel off toughest outer leaves of <b>LEMONGRASS</b>. Cut off the 
    hard root end. Smash the bottom 6 inches lightly with your kitchen 
    mallet. Cut both into 3 2-inch lengths.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise medium. Mix with Lemongrass.</li>

  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a large saucepan mix <b>Water</b> and smashed <b>Chickpeas</b>. 
    Mix in <b>Lemongrass mix</b> and bring to a  boil. Cover and simmer 
    about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Shallot Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Shallot mix</b> stirring until Shallots are softened. 
    Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and continue to fry until well softened.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Salt</b> into Beans. Simmer another 
    5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check liquid (it should be fairly soupy) and seasoning. Stir 
    in <b>Lime Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Garnish with <b>Cilantro</b> and serve with Jasmine Rice 
    (see <a href="sop_ckptom1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>). This recipe reheats well

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chickpeas:</h3> &nbsp; Make sure dried Chickpeas 
  are fresh. If a year or more old they will not become tender. For 
  a more refined soup use regular large beige chickpeas (Kabuli Chana). 
  For a more rustic soup use Indian chickpeas (Kala Chana). For details 
  see our pages 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_chickz.html"><b>Chickpeas (Kabul Type)</b></a> 
  and <a href="../ingred/bp_chicbz.html"><b>Chickpeas (Desi Type)</b></a>.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lemon Grass:</h3> &nbsp; An essential for 
  Southeast Asian cuisines, these tough grass stems are now widely 
  available in North American markets that serve a Southeast Asian 
  community. I've even seen them in some Korean markets. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/gr_lemonz.html"><b>Lemon Grass</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Shallot Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This is a pantry staple 
  in Southeast Asia. It can be easily made by our recipe 
  <a href="siv_shalfry1.html"><b>Fried Shallots / Shallot Oil</b></a>. 
  If you don't have time, use another oil such as Pure Olive Oil (not 
  virgin).</li>
<li id="04"><h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Southeast Asia, soups 
  are usually ladled onto the rice. For Western service I find it much 
  more convenient to serve the soup in individual bowls and provide 
  a bowl of Jasmine rice on the table with a spoon so diners can 
  spoon some into their soup bowl to mix as they wish. For buffet 
  service, I just stir in the Cilantro. There will always be a rice 
  cooker full of Jasmine Rice on the table.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I have made this two ways:   
  a fairly refined version using regular beige Chickpeas (Kabuli Chana) 
  and peeled Tomatoes for general serving, and a very rustic version 
  using Indian Kala Chana and unpeeled Tomatoes (chopped fine). That 
  one has plenty of fragments of thick bean skins and tomato skins in 
  it, but is quite tasty. You can make an even more refined version by 
  peeling the Tomatoes and using Chana Dal (skipping the overnight soak). 
  Chana Dal is peeled and split Kala Chana.</li>
