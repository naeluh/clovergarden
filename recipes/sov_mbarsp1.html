This soup is delicious, but see <a href="sov_mbarsp1.html#05"><b>Comments</b></a>. Nonya 
are mostly descendants of Malaysian women who married Chinese merchants, 
and adopted Chinese cuisine, applying a Malay twist.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>ANCHOVIES</b> in warm water for about 20 minutes. Break 
    their bellies open and scrape out the black stuff inside (it can make 
    soups sour). Cut into several pieces so their flavor will be 
    distributed. Including the heads is up to you. Dry on paper towels.
    </li>
  <li>Rinse <b>MALABAR SPINACH</b> well. Remove leaves and tender tips 
    from stems. Tear large leaves into smaller pieces. Keep stems 
    separate. Use all stems that snap off cleanly, and some a bit 
    larger if you need too. Cut stems diagonally, 3/4 inch at the thick 
    end to 1-1/4 inch or more at the tender end.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PORK</b> about 1/4 inch.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Break <b>Salted Duck Egg</b> into a small bowl and break up the 
    yolk into small pieces with a fork, it'll be quite stiff, while the 
    white will be liquid. For <b>Chicken Egg</b> just scramble lightly.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a sauce pan Heat <b>Oil</b> over moderate flame and fry 
    <b>Anchovies</b> for about 2 minutes. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> for 30 
    seconds, then stir in <b>Pork</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Fry stirring 
    until Pork has completely lost its raw color. </li>
  <li>Stir in 4 cups <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil, then 
    simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Salted Duck Egg</b> and break it up moderately, like 
    for Egg Flower Soup.  Stir a little and simmer until Duck Egg is 
    cooked through. For Chicken egg, just stir, but not too much.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Malabar Spinach Stems</b> and bring to a simmer for 
    about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Malabar Spinach Leaves</b>. Bring back to a boil. As 
    soon as all leaves are wilted and with a cooked color, turn off the 
    heat.</li>
  <li>Check <b>Salt</b> and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Malabar Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; [Mong Toi, Saan Choy] &nbsp; 12 ounces 
  as sold should yield at least 8 ounces usable. The bunch used for the 
  photo example yielded 11 ounces. Be careful not to overcook it - it can 
  become slimy. If you need to use some stems that don't snap cleanly, 
  cut them diagonally into short lengths. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_malabarz.html"><b>Malabar Spinach</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Anchovies:</h3> &nbsp; Use the large dried anchovies (about 
  3 inches long). They are available in most Asian markets, especially 
  Philippine and Korean. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_anchodz.html"><b>Dried Anchovies</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Salted Duck Egg:</h3> &nbsp; This needs to be <u>RAW</u> (read 
  the label). Boiled Salted Duck Eggs don't work in this recipe, but 
  raw can be harder to find, so some cooks just use a regular fresh 
  chicken egg, The photo example was made with a Raw Salted Duck Egg.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Salt</h3> &nbsp; The amount will depend on whether you used a 
  Salted Duck Egg or a regular Chicken Egg. With Chicken Egg the soup 
  will need about 1 teaspoon, with Salted Duck Egg about 1/2 teaspoon.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Consumed alone and in excess, due to the 
  mucilaginous nature of the Malabar Spinach, this soup can produce 
  mild gastric distress. I suggest keeping servings to 1-1/2 cups or 
  less. You can also place a bowl of steamed rice on the table to be 
  spooned in as desired. As a soup course with other foods, not a 
  problem.</li>
