  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BLACK MUSHROOMS</b> in hot water for at least 45 minutes. 
    Drain and slice abut 1/4 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>YOU CHOY</b>. Cut off any really huge stem ends and 
    discard yellowing or damaged leaves. Take a plant or two and slice the 
    thick end diagonally 3/4 inch, then, working up, increase to 1-1/2 
    inch. At the leaves, slice across to about 3/4 inch .</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop coarse. 
    Slice <b>THAI CHILIS</b> open from cap to tip. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Canned Mushrooms</b> and mix with <b>Black Mushrooms</b>. 
    Cut <b>Baby Corn</b> into two or three pieces depending on size, 
    and mix in with Mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKON</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>SCALLIONS</b> into about 1-1/2 inch lengths, white and 
    green.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>OIL</b> and stir 
    in <b>Onion Mix</b>. Fry stirring just until you see the first hints 
    of color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Yu Choy</b> and fry stirring until leaves are wilted 
    (about a minute).</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Daikon</b>, <b>Mushroom mix</b>, <b>Stock</b>, 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer 
    until the thickest pieces are just tender enough to eat.</li>
  <li>Adjust Liquid if needed, there should be quite a bit. Season to 
    taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Black Pepper</b>, then stir in 
    <b>Scallions</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, with a bowl of <b>Steamed Jasmine Rice</b> on the table 
    to be spooned in as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are the regular dried Shiitakes 
  found in the Asian section of nearly all markets. You can use fresh 
  Shiitakes, but soak them in the hot water for about 20 minutes and 
  squeeze them out - this changes their texture from dry to silky.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yu Choy:</h3> &nbsp; This popular green is now very available in 
  Asian markets, but hasn't hit the supers. Shanghai Bok Choy (sold as 
  "Baby Bok Choy") could also be used. Other Choys will probably also 
  work, though they need more cooking time on the stems. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Asian Cabbage / Mustard 
  Greens</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; (green or red) &nbsp; I use 4 Thai Chilis, but 
  most people might be happier with 3, or even 2 if you haven't yet made 
  your peace with the Chili Gods. Only a wimp would use just 1. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b>
  </a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe presumes canned mushrooms. The 
  photo example used 1 can of Button Mushrooms and 1 can of Unpeeled 
  Straw Mushrooms (which turned out to be unusually small).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Daikon Radish:</h3> &nbsp; Choose smaller ones, as the larger 
  become fibrous when cooked. An alternate is Taro Root, widely use in 
  the Tropics. Not authentically tropical, but Potatoes could also be 
  used. White Rose work fine, but avoid Yukon Gold types, as they turn 
  to mush if cooked a little beyond the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/am_taroz.html"><b>Taro</b></a> and 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> pages.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This is normally Chicken Stock, but for 
  Vegetarian you can use a good vegetable stock. You will also have to 
  replace the Fish Sauce with more Soy Sauce or some other substitute. 
  Vegans, note that Mushrooms are closely related to Animals, not 
  Plants.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> While less vegetarian, quartered Fish Balls, or 
  Shrimp (halved if too large) would not be at all out of place in this 
  soup.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; When searching my recipe files for "orphan"
  recipes, I came across this one, lost for 12 years. There was a good 
  photo, so I had made it, but The recipe page was incomplete. It had a 
  title, photo, attribution to Malaysia, the amount of Yu Choy to use, a 
  filename, date, and source Web site - nothing else. The referenced 
  Web site was gone, so I re-constructed the recipe from the photo - 
  thus the "California" designation. This reconstruction was highly 
  successful.</li>
