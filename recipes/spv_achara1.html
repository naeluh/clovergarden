This pickle / relish, favored throughout the Philippines, is clearly 
of Indian derivation, but they don't use vinegar in India, except in 
tiny Goa. This relish can be  sour, sweet-sour, or sweet, but this 
recipe is fairly sour.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - plus cooling and chilling time)
  <ol>
  <li>Shred or grate the <b>PAPAYA</b>. I peel the thin skin off with a 
    swivel vegetable peeler, then use a julienning vegetable peeler to 
    shave it into narrow strands, right down to the seed chamber. Then 
    I cut the strands crosswise about 1-1/4 inches long.</li>
  <li>Reduce <b>CARROTS</b> to narrow strips. I do this exactly as for 
    the Papaya.</li>
  <li>Reduce <b>GINGER</b> to narrow strips. Best to slice thin crosswise, 
    then cut slices into strips.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> thin into narrow strips of similar size 
    to those of the Papaya, but they'll be wider.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>All the Above</b> in a large mixing bowl, along with 
    <b>Raisins</b>.</li>
  <li>In a 5 quart non-reactive pot, mix <b>Vinegar</b> with 
    <b>Sugar</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil until all the Salt 
    and Sugar are dissolved.
  <li>Stir in <b>Papaya mix</b>. Bring to a boil over high heat tumbling 
    often. Once at a boil, keep on a strong simmer for another 10 minutes, 
    tumbling fairly often. By this time the liquid should be nearly up 
    to the top of the vegetables.</li>
  <li>Set aside to cool, tumbling a couple of times.</li>
  <li>Pack in sterile jars and refrigerate. Actually, I pack it in a 
    heat sealed 2-mil food grade polyethylene bag.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Papaya:</h3> &nbsp; These easy to find in markets catering 
  to a Philippine or other Southeast Asian community. They are fully 
  unripe and the seeds are still pure white, but already have a peppery 
  taste. The one I based this recipe on weighed 2-1/2 pounds, about the 
  size they are around here, and it yielded just under 2 pounds 2 ounces 
  of shreds for the recipe. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/br_papaz.html"><b>Papayas</b></a> page.</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3>> &nbsp; This should be one of the fine cane vinegars 
  available from Philippine markets, but Coconut or Palm vinegar could 
  also be used. Lacking the real thing, rice vinegar. or lacking even 
  that, distilled white vinegar cut about 1/4 with water - it's a bit 
  harsher. For details see our <a href="../ingred/sours.html">
  <b>Sours</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
<h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Given above is the quick method which allows the 
  pickle to be used even right away if needed. The long method uses the 
  same ingredients but more vinegar because the Papaya is soaked 
  overnight in about 1-1/2 cups vinegar and 3/4 cup salt, then wrung out 
  as dry as possible. All vegetable ingredients are mixed together. The 
  pickle solution is brought to a boil for a few mintutes, then poured 
  over the vegetables. When cool it is packed in jars and refrigerated 
  for a week before using.</li>
