This mild and tasty pickle is much used as a flavoring and table 
condiment in Vietnam. Some prefer the leaves, others the stems, but 
both are good.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; 	(30 min + 7 to 10 days)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate the leaves of the <b>MUSTARD GREENS</b> and float wash. 
    Dry well, preferably in a salad spinner. </li>
  <li>Wilt the <b>Greens</b> by one of the methods suggested in 
   <a href="spv_duachu1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> to achieve the right balance between 
   salt and liquid.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise into wedges, about 1/2 inch on the 
    thick side. Wilt similarly to the Mustard Greens.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Leaves</b> into about 1 inch pieces, including the thick 
    stem part. Mix with the <b>Onions</b>.</li>
  <li>Combine all <b>Pickle items</b> in a pot of sufficient size to 
    hold the full recipe and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and 
    let cool until you can stick a finger in without pain.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Greens</b> into the pot and let sit covered an hour or 
    so, then pack into a sterile jar and pour in enough of the Pickle 
    to cover. Screw down the lid and set in a fairly warm location.</li>
  <li>Once a day, open the jar to relieve pressure and sample the 
    greens. push down any that are floating to the top to keep them 
    well washed with brine, or they may mold. When the flavor is good, 
    drain and refrigerate. 4 or 5 days seems good. It will keep a month 
    or so in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Mustard Greens:</b> &nbsp;  I make this from Small Gai Choy, 
  which is easily available here in Los Angeles. Large Gai Choy is much 
  stemmier - resulting in something more like my photo example, which 
  is all stems cut out from leaves used to make Chinese 
  <a href="cpv_snowvg1.html"><b>Snow Vegetable</b></a>. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage, Mustard, 
  Turnip & Radish Greens</b></a> page, particularly the Asian Greens 
  section.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Sea Salt:</b> &nbsp; <u>Natural</u> sea salt should be used for 
  salt pickling. I emphasize "natural", because many major brands of 
  "sea salt" are highly refined. Most table salts, and some kosher 
  salts, include "flow agents" which may cloud pickles. If it sea 
  salt doesn't seem a little moist, it's not natural. Various pundits 
  tell you that "salt is salt, it's nearly all sodium chloride", but 
  the Koreans, who do far more salt pickling than anyone else, maintain 
  that some of the minor salts in sea salt are important to proper 
  fermentation. Of course you can buy sea salt from gourmet outlets 
  for astounding prices, but if you find a Korean market you can buy 
  big sacks of it economically. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/salt.html"><b>Salt</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Sugar:</b> &nbsp; I adhered to the lowest amount of sugar given 
  in any of the recipes I studied. Western tastes are more comfortable 
  with less sugar, which is an addictive toxin anyway. Use sugar to 
  your own taste, some recipes asked for more than 1/4 cup. Eeeek!
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Wilting:</b> Threading a string through the strongest points and 
  hanging overnight indoors is recommended by Fuchsia Dunlop. She 
  mentions that many people in China dry half a day in the sun, hung up 
  on string or spread out on bamboo trays, but she's based in London 
  where they don't have sun. The object here is not to get any actual 
  dryness, but to wilt for the right balance of water and salt. I tend 
  to be pressed for time, so I dry them in my electric dehydrator, fan 
  on and low temperature, for about 1 hour, until lightly wilted. It 
  would be much faster at medium temperature, but would take more 
  attention to prevent over drying.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Comments:</b> &nbsp; Note that the amount of salt is fairly 
  important, though less critical than in salt pickles that depend on 
  the juices exuded by the vegetables. Use some method to keep the 
  leaves completely submerged. A small, tightly sealed plastic bag 
  partially filled with water can work, or just push the top ones down 
  to wash in the brine every day to prevent mold. The color of Mustard 
  Greens will fade, and their fierce sharpness will be toned down. </li>
