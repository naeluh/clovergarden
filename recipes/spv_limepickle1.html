If you have something like a plain rice porridge that needs a bit of 
zing, this tart spicy pickle is very much up to the job. It has a little 
chili bite, but lots of lime juice and spices. See <a href="spv_limepickle1.html#07">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 days - 10 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Put <b>LIMES</b> in a heatproof bowl. Boil enough water to 
    completely cover the limes. Turn off the heat and pour water over the 
    limes (or pour the limes into the water). Let soak 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Limes</b> and cut into quarters (I halve lengthwise, then 
    cut crosswise int quarters). Tumble them with <b>Salt</b> until the 
    salt is well worked in.</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Limes</b> into a glass jar and place on a counter where the 
    jar will get at least 2 hours direct sunlight per day. Turn occasionaly 
    for 6 days.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 15 min work)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> and <b>GINGER</b> medium. Grind 
    <b>Coriander</b>. Mix all <b>Spicing items</b>.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> with <b>Mustard Seeds</b> until seeds are popping 
    well, then turn down the heat, pour in the <b>Spicing Mix</b> and fry 
    stirring for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour in the <b>Limes</b> and any liquid that has gathered in the jar. 
    Cover and simmer on very low heat 45 minutes to an hour, tumbling 
    now and then.</li>
  <li>Put up in a jar and store in a cool place out of sunlight - it'll 
    keep for a couple months at least - much longer in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Key Limes:</h3> &nbsp; These are the tiny limes 
  they use for Key Lime Pie in Florida - 1 inch to 1-1/2 inches 
  diameter. This is the lime most of the world knows as a "lime", the 
  huge Persian / Tahiti lime we are accustomed to in North America is 
  unknown in most regions. Indian recipes that say, "a lump of tamarind 
  the size of a lime" have caused much confusion.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Real unrefined sea salt is 
  the kind to use in all natural pickles - some of the trace elements 
  are very important. Supermarket and much "Health Food" sea salt 
  started out from the sea but is refined into an "unnatural" state. If 
  sea salt doesn't seem just a little damp, it's refined. I buy my 
  pickling salt from Korean markets. Koreans are very big on natural 
  pickles and you can be sure it's not only the right stuff, but cheap! 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/salt.html">Salt</a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; This will regulate how 
  hot the finished product is. I use Rashamptti but others may be 
  selected to your taste. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html#ground">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Curry Leaves</h3> &nbsp; These fresh leaves are 
  necessary for the true flavor of southern India, and are now reasonably 
  available in Indian markets, at least here in California. Dried ones 
  aren't of much use. If you don't have them you will have to leave them 
  out - there is no acceptable substitute. Use caution with how many you 
  use, because some people don't like the resinous taste. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ci_curryz.html">Curry Leaves</a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Gingelly Oil</h3> &nbsp; This is oil from 
  unroasted sesame seeds. <b>Do Not</b> substitute Chinese style sesame 
  oil made from roasted sesame seeds. It may simply be labeled "Sesame 
  Oil". Laxmi is the brand I have on hand, and the jar looks very Indian, 
  but the oil was made in USA. If you can't find any, use use Pure 
  Olive Oil (not virgin), Rice Bran Oil or some other light oil that 
  will go over 395&deg;F/202&deg;C (the popping point for black mustard 
  seeds).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mustard Seed</h3> &nbsp; Black mustard seed is used in India and 
  Southeast Asia. Available from markets serving an Indian community.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; This exact recipe came from Singapore, but 
  nearly identical pickles are made this way in Karella, India.</li>
