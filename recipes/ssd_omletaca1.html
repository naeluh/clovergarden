In Thailand and Burma, this omelet is very popular as a side dish and as 
an addition to hot &amp; sour soups. Alas, Acacia Shoots are problematic 
(see below) so we suggest using a substitute.

<i>Senegalia pannata</i> (Cha Om) plants are highly illegal in Australia, 
New Zealand, California and Hawaii. Frozen packages of leaf shoots are 
legal, but may not be easy to find in North America, so we suggest 
Dandelion leaves as a substitute. Some may not appreciate the rubber 
cement smell and taste of real Cha Om anyway.

  <h3>Prep</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Strip tender <b>CHA-OM FRONDS</b> from the stems (if needed) and 
    chop them medium. If you don't have Cha-Om, strip 
    <b>Dandelion Leaves</b> from thick stems.  I strip with a fingernail 
    from the thick end to wherever they break off. Chop the leaves medium. 
    1-1/2 ounce is good. The photo example is with Cha-Om.</li>
  <li>With a fork beat <b>EGGS</b>, <b>Leaves</b> and <b>Salt</b> together 
    well.</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Run</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in your omelet pan and pour in the egg mixture. You 
    want to fry covered and on much lower heat than for a French omelet 
    because it must set well all the way through. When it's golden on the 
    bottom and set, flip it over and fry on the other side, uncovered, 
    until just a little golden.</li>
  <li>Turn out onto your cutting board and cut into squares, strips or 
    wedges as desired.</li>
  <li>If serving as an appetizer, cut into strips or wedges. If serving 
    in soup, cut into small squares.</li>
  <li>Serve warm (preferable) or at room temperature, with a Southeast 
    Asian dip. I find 1/3 Thai Fish Sauce and 2/3 Aged Rice Vinegar 
    (Kon Yen brand) to be quite good with this.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Acacia Leaves:</b> &nbsp; In North America these are available 
  frozen from some Asian markets. If you can, get "Cha Om Without Stems" 
  so you don't have to strip them. If you can't get Cha Om, use young 
  dandelion leaves with the stems stripped out, about 1-1/2 ounces of 
  leaf. Some have suggested using cilantro leaves but this is not a good 
  substitute. Dandelions are sulfurous and bitter, like acacia, but 
  milder. For details see our <a href="../ingred/bp_acaciaz.html">
  <b>Acacia</b></a> page and our <a href="../ingred/dy_dandez.html">
  <b>Dandelion</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Comments:</b> &nbsp; I liked these omelets so much I adapted the 
  recipe to other herbs as California <a href="9ad_omlhrb1.html">
