Water Spinach is very popular in South and Southeast Asia, and has 
a particular flavor affinity with shrimp, fresh, dried, or paste, as 
shown in this side dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)

  <li>Run <b>SHRIMP</b> to powder in your spice grinder (see 
    <a href="ssf_wspnshp1.html#04"><b>Method</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Strip Leaves from <b>WATER SPINACH</b> leaving their stems behind. 
    Tear into 3 inch lengths if too long. Discard overly thick stem ends 
    (more than 1/4 inch diameter) and cut all stems, including leaf stems,  
    into about 1-1/2 inch lengths - keep separate from leaves.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>

  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok, stir in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring 
    over moderate heat just until garlic threatens to color, then stir in 
    <b>Dried Shrimp</b> and continue to fry stirring for another 
    30 seconds or so.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water Spinach Stems</b>. Fry over high heat until 
    partially wilted (about 2 minutes), then stir in the <b>Water 
    Spinach Leaves</b>. Continue frying for another minute or so until 
    leaves are mostly wilted. Larger stems should remain a bit crunchy.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Oyster Sauce</b> and serve hot with steamed Jasmine rice.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Shrimp:</h3> Plastic bags of whole dried shrimp are available at 
  Korean, Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. The recipe presumes tiny 
  shrimp, if you have the larger ones use 1/2 cup as they don't pack as 
  well.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water Spinach</h3> &nbsp; [Pak Bung, Ong Choy] &nbsp; This member 
  of the morning glory family is a prohibited "noxious weed" in most of 
  the United States, but is legal in California. It is widely available 
  in the Asian markets here in Los Angeles. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3>  &nbsp; Most recipes call for soaking the shrimp in 
  water for 15 minutes or more, then pounding in a mortar. I find a lot 
  of small pieces survive this, and Americans are not accustomed to 
  little prickly things in their vegetables. Running to powder in a 
  spice grinder fixes this problem.</li>
