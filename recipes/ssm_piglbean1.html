A bit too strong flavored to be a main dish, but is a flavorful accent 
dish, or one part of an Asian menu. It can be made days in advance, right 
up to the final warming.

<p>Making the Curry Paste may look daunting, but it's not really hard if 
you have good equipment. Finding all the ingredients may be harder for 
many people.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>PORK</b> thin and cut into medium strips. Mix with 1T 
    <b>Fish Sauce</b> and marinate, turning a few times, while doing the 
    rest of the prep.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>LONG BEANS</b> into 1 inch lengths. Cook in boiling water 
    until crisp tender. Refresh in cold running water.</li>
  <li>Make <b>Curry Paste</b> using ingredients in order given.
    <ol>
    <li><b>Kaffir Lime Rind:</b> &nbsp; If you have fresh limes you can 
      grate just like regular rinds, but you probably have frozen ones, 
      if any. Chop as fine as you can and pound to a paste in your 
      <a href="../ke/mortar.html"><b>Big Granite Mortar</b></a> (the rind 
      bits will just laugh at your food processor).</li>
    <li><b>Galangal:</b> &nbsp; Slice very thin, chop very fine, add to 
      the mortar and pound.</li>
    <li><b>Lemon Grass:</b> &nbsp; Strip off tough outer leaves and cut 
      off hard root end. Pound flat with your kitchen mallet, then slice 
      the bottom 4 inches crosswise very thin. Chop fine, add to the 
      mortar and pound.</li>
    <li><b>Cilantro Root:</b> &nbsp; Chop fine, add to the mortar and 
      pound.</li>
    <li>In your spice grinder reduce <b>Chilis</b>, <b>Dried Shrimp</b>, 
      <b>Pepper Corns</b> and <b>Salt</b> to powder. Mix with the stuff 
      you pounded in the mortar.</li>
    <li><b>Shallots</b> and <b>Garlic:</b> &nbsp; Chop fine and reduce to 
      paste. A mini-prep food processor can be used here, or the mortar. 
      Mix thoroughly with all the pounded stuff and the <b>Shrimp Paste</b>.
      </li>      
    </ol>
    </li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Palm Sugar</b>, <b>Fish Sauce</b> and <b>Water</b>.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp;  (20 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or wok, heat <b>Oil</b> and stir in 
    the <b>Pork</b>. Fry stirring until pork is cooked through and starts 
    to brown in spots. Remove with a slotted spoon leaving as much oil 
    behind as possible. Drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Chili Paste</b> into pan and fry until aromatic.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish Sauce mix</b> and deglaze the pan, scraping with a 
    wooden spatula.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Pork</b> and <b>Long Beans</b>. Simmer covered stirring 
    once or twice until heated through.</li>
  <li>Serve.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for lean meat without fat or 
  bone.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Long Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These have a darker, sweeter flavor than 
  regular green beans, but you can use those if you don't have long beans 
  - but use a shorter cooking time. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_longz.html"><b>Long Beans</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kaffir Lime Rind:</h3> &nbsp; This is probably the hardest 
  ingredient to find (I have my own tree). If you don't have any, use 
  grated zest of a regular lime (green only). Different flavor, but 
  it'll have to do. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ci_kaffirz.html"><b>Kaffir Lime</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Galangal:</h3> &nbsp; Use fresh or frozen only. This is now grown 
  in Southern California and becoming easily available in markets serving 
  Southeast Asian communities. If you can't get it, use fresh Ginger Root 
  - different flavor but not that much is used in this recipe in any case.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cilantro Root:</h3> &nbsp; still very difficult to find even in 
  Los Angeles. If you don't have it use the lower stems of fresh Cilantro 
  (no leaves) and use twice as much.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Three dried red Thai Chilis make this dish 
  moderately hot by Southern California standards. If that sounds too 
  hot for you, use Japones, which will make it milder. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Dried Shrimp:</h3> &nbsp; Easily found in markets serving 
  Southeast Asian, Korean or Latin American communities. To measure, 
  crumble fairly fine, but before grinding to powder.</li> 
<li id="08">
  <h3>Shrimp Paste:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use a Thai shrimp paste - less 
  rude and pungent than most others. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_shmpsaucz.html"><b>Shrimp Sauces / Pastes</b></a> 
  page .</li>
