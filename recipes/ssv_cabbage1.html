This recipe makes a tasty side of greens or a light vegetarian main dish 
for two. I often make it when I'm tired of meat. Most varieties of choy 
will work  For a similar recipe with pork, see 
<a href="smm_pigchoy1.html"><b>Pork with Choy &amp; Mushrooms</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Choy:</h3> &nbsp; The photo shows miniature Bok Choy, one of my 
  favorites (not what supermarkets call "baby bok choy", that's actually 
  Shanghai bok choy). Other choys to consider are Choy Sum (white or 
  green), Shanghai Bok Choy, regular Bok Choy, Yu Choy (oilseeed rape) 
  or Napa Cabbage. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_green.html#asia"><b>Cabbage & Mustard 
  Greens</b></a> page (the Asian Greens section).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Fresh Oyster Mushrooms are best, 
  particularly the small King Trumpet mushrooms now common in 
  California. Canned can be used, including Straw Mushrooms. If using 
  fresh Shiitakes, Give them a soak in hot water for 20 minutes, then 
  squeeze dry. This transforms their texture. Strict Vegans should be 
  aware that mushrooms are closely related to animals, not plants. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus / 
  Mushrooms</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use Red Fresnos, but Holland 
  Red will do fine, or half of a red Anaheim. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; For an entirely vegetarian dish, you need to 
  use a vegetable stock, such as the one in our recipe 
  <a href="giv_stockv1.html"><b>Vegetable Stock</b></a>. If that isn't 
  an   issue, you can use chicken or pork stock.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; What you want is the 
  ugly brown stuff. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> page. 
  If you don't have that, <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce</b></a> will also work fine, but that would be "don't 
  ask, don't tell", not strict vegetarian.</li>
