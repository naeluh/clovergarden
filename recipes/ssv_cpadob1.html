An interesting vegetable side dish or appetizer from the Philippines, 
mildly tart and quite tasty. How hot is up to the kind of chilis you use 
(use mild ones - see <a href="ssv_cpadob1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).

    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth mix</b>. Bring to a boil, then turn down and simmer 
    covered until chilis are cooked through but still have some crunch. How 
    long depends on what chilis you use - Shishito 15 min max, others may 
    take longer. Sample until you have it right.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with a main dish (probably not an adobo) and steamed 
    Jasmine rice. As an appetizer, warm is still best, but Shishito are 
    quite good at room temperature too.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Green Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; In the Philippines mild 
  <i>Sili Mahaba</i> (Long Chili) would be used (and were used in 
  the photo). These have outstanding flavor in this recipe, but are just 
  now (2015) becoming available in the Philippine markets here in Los 
  Angeles, but not reliably. They may be nearly impossible to get 
  elsewhere. As a substitute, I recommend the wrinkly Japanese Shishito 
  Chilis (available Philippine, Korean and other markets). Though 
  smaller, they have a heat range similar to the Mahabas. They are also 
  very tasty  and attractive in this dish. Sweet Italian chilis would 
  probably work, and Spanish Padron peppers, similarly used in Spain, 
  certainly will. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html"><b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; This should be one of the 
  fine cane vinegars available from Philippine markets. My favorite is 
  Datu Puti brand Sukang Iloco - Native (natural) Vinegar, which is dark 
  in color, but lighter cane vinegars can be used. Coconut vinegar 
  would also work, but lacking these, use distilled white vinegar - not 
  as flavorful and harsher, so use a little less. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sours.html">Vinegar &amp; Souring Agents</a> page.</li>
