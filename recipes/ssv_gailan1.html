A simple, very flavorful, stir fry side dish, which can stand alone with 
rice if the mushrooms are included. The Oyster sauce is not essential, 
so it can easily be made pure vegetarian.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>GAIN LAN</b> and drain very well (salad spinner is good). 
    Remove <b>Leaves</b> and tender tips from Stems. Cut or tear 
    Leaves into bite size pieces. Cut stems diagonally about 2 inches 
    long (peel any that are overly thick).  Keep Leaves and Stems 
    separate.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> crosswise very thin, then into fine 
    matchsticks.</li>
  <li>Crush and chop <b>GARLIC</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 3/16 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Cornstarch</b> with <b>Water</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok and stir in <b>Ginger</b> until aromatic, 
    then stir in <b>Garlic</b> for about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Gai Lan Stems</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b>. Fry stirring 
    for about 3 minutes. Stir in <b>Gai Lan Leaves</b> until well coated 
    with oil and wilted.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b>, and bring quickly to a boil. Cover and 
    simmer until Gai Lan stems are crisp tender, just a couple minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir up <b>Cornstarch</b> and stir in just long enough to thicken 
    the sauce a little.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle in <b>Sesame Oil</b> and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><h3>Gai Lan:</h3> &nbsp; [Chinese Broccoli] &nbsp; 
  This popular vegetable can be found in most markets serving an 
  Asian community. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cb_brocccz.html"><b>Gai Lan / Chinese 
  Broccoli</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Various Mushrooms can be used with some 
  difference in flavor. Dried Black Mushrooms work well and are quite 
  meaty (start with 3/4 oz dry). Give them at least a half hour soak 
  in warm water before stemming and cutting. Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms 
  are also very good. Give them a 20 minute soak in hot water before 
  stemming and cutting, it changes their texture from coarse to silky. 
  Various varieties of Oyster Mushrooms can be use, giving the recipe 
  a lighter flavor than the Black Mushrooms or Shiitakes, but still 
  meaty. Regular white mushrooms would be my last choice, but still 
  good. Mushrooms can be omitted entirely if desired. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Use a good, drinkable Chinese rice wine, 
  not that horrid salted "cooking" version. If you don't have this, 
  use a Dry Sherry. Sake is made from rice but is not considered a good 
  substitute, it's beer, not wine. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bv_chinaz.html"><b>Chinese Rice Wine</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; For a purely vegetarian recipe, this 
  can be omitted. It is a standard Chinese sauce used in Southeast Asia 
  for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite is Megachef, but 
  Lee Kum Kee Premium brand is also excellent - it's in a very Chinese 
  looking bottle but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, these brands are  
  more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that (much higher 
  oyster content, unleaded and no melamine).</li>
