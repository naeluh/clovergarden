Filipino home cooking uses a lot of greens, mostly from the back yard 
garden. This recipe yields an excellent side dish of greens for either 
a Philippine or Western menu.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sitaw Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; [Long Bean Leaves] &nbsp; Weight is for 
  only leaves and tender shoots, because yield can be very different 
  from bundle to bundle. At my local market, you need about 1-1/4 pounds 
  to yield 10 ounces. My local Philippine market puts out bundles of 
  greens on Friday or Saturday morning to sell through the weekend. For 
  details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_lbleafz.html"><b>Sitaw (Long Bean) Leaves</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Control hotness to your taste. Three Fresno 
  Chilis makes it very moderately spicy by Southern California standards. 
  You could also use green chilis. One Chili Serrano will be moderately 
  hot.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_philz.html">
  <b>Philippine Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fish Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as important to 
  Southeast Asian cooking as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The main cooking oil of the Philippines is 
  Coconut Oil. Yes, the AHA (American Heart Association) practically 
  drove this oil out of the USA, urging you to use deadly trans fats 
  instead. As we now know, they could not have been more wrong, and 
  many nutritionists hold Coconut Oil to be the most healthy oil. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cocoz.html">
