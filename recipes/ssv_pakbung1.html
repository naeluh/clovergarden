This simple stir fry has good flavor and interesting texture - but is 
<u>NOT</u> as Thai street vendors cook it (see <a href="ssv_pakbung1.html#06">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Strip Leaves from <b>PAK BUNG</b> leaving leaf stems behind. Tear 
    into 3 inch lengths if too long. Discard overly thick stem ends (more 
    than 1/4 inch diameter) and cut all stems including leaf stems into 
    about 1-1/2 inch lengths - keep separate from leaves.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half 
    lengthwise and slice very thin crosswise. Slice <b>CHILIS</b> very 
    thin. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Heat <b>OIL</b> in a wok and stir in <b>Garlic Mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring just until garlic starts to color, then stir in <b>Pak Bung 
    Stems</b>. Fry over high heat until partially wilted (about 2 
    minutes), then stir in the <b>Pak Bung Leaves</b>. Continue frying 
    for another minute or so until leaves are mostly wilted. Larger stems 
    should remain a bit crunchy.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce Mix</b>, and bring quickly to a boil. Season to 
    taste with <b>Black Pepper</b> and serve hot with rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pak Bung:</h3> &nbsp; [Ong Choy, Water Spinach, Swamp Cabbage] 
  &nbsp; Sold here as Ong Choy, this vegetable is very popular with all 
  Southeast Asian cultures, but is a controlled substance in some states. 
  In California it can be produced by licensed growers and transported 
  without a permit. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mg_wspinz.html"><b>Water Spinach</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Control hotness to your taste. Three Thai 
  chilis makes it moderately spicy by Southern California standards. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cp_thaiz.html">
  <b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yellow Bean Sauce</h3> &nbsp; This is a very popular sauce in 
  Thailand, and is sometimes used as a vegetarian replacement for fish 
  sauce. You want the ugly brown kind. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/bp_yelbeanz.html"><b>Yellow Bean Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oyster Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A standard Chinese sauce also used in 
  Southeast Asia for dishes in the Chinese style. My current favorite 
  is Megachef, but Lee Kum Kee <u>Premium</u> brand is also very good 
  - the bottle looks very Chinese, but it's made in Los Angeles. Yes, 
  these are more expensive than some, but there's reasons for that 
  (much higher oyster content, unleaded and no melamine). For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_oysterz.html"><b>Oyster Sauce</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments</h3> &nbsp; Thai street vendors cook this in large woks 
  kept at extremely high temperature. The pan contents explode into 
  flames several times and the contents are tossed into the air to 
  extinguish them. This is not recommended for home kitchens.</li>
