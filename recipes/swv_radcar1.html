This is perhaps the most popular pickle used in 
<a href="swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Mi Sandwiches</b></a> but has many 
other uses, especially as a garnish. It is easy to make, amd ready after 
an hour's rest. You can vary the ratio between Carrot and Daikon however 
you like.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKON</b>, cut into about 3 inch lengths, and cut those 
    into sticks less than 1/4 inch on a side. I use a julienning 
    vegetable peeler, and a kinife for what it can't do. If you want 
    your sticks larger, you can cut with a knife.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROT</b> and cut similarly to the Daikon. Again, I use a 
    julienning vegetable peeler. Mix with Daikon.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Daikon mix</b> in a non-reactive bowl. Massage well with 
    the <b>Salt</b> and <b>Sugar</b>. Let stand for about 20 minutes, 
    massaging now and then. They are done when a Daikon stick can be bent 
    around so its ends touch without cracking. Drain, rinse well and 
    drain again.</li>
  <li>Dry <b>Daikon mix</b> reasonably well. A salad spinner does a very 
    good job for this.</li> 
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b> until sugar is dissolved.</li>
  <li>Pack the <b>Daikon mix</b> into about a 4 cup jar and fill with 
    the <b>Pickle mix</b>. Cover and let stand at least one hour before 
    use.  It can be refrigerated up to a month.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Daikon Radish:</b> &nbsp; Select Daikons that 
  are 2 inches diameter or less. Larger ones get fibrous. Other 
  radishes can be used. If using small red radishes, they should be 
  left unpeeled and cut into slices about 1/8 inch thick. The carrots 
  are still cut into sticks.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Distilled white vinegear works well for these. 
  In small batches I sometimes use rice vinegar, but the ratio to water 
  should be weighted a little more on the vinegar side.</li>
