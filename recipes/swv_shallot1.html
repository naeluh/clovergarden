This quick pickle produces an excellent addition to 
<a href="swx_banhmi1.html"><b>Banh Mi Sandwiches</b></a>. In larger 
sandwiches, this pickle should be combined with another pickle as it 
is a bit strong.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>SHALLOTS</b> in half lengthwise. Cut off the tip and 
    peel, separating any multiple cloves. Peel any outer layers that 
    aren't bright and shiny. Cut lengthwise back almost to 
    the root end into wedges about 1/3 inch wide at the widest point. 
    Cut off the root ends to free the wedges.</li>
  <li>Soak <b>Shallot Wedges</b> in cold water for about 10 minutes to 
    reduce the harshness. Drain well and pack into a 2 cup jar.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b>. Bring to a boil and stir until all 
    solids are dissolved. Remove from heat for 30 seconds, then pour 
    into the jar with the <b>Shallots</b>.</li>
  <li>As the Shallots soften, push them down so they are completely 
    covered by the brine (see <a href="swv_shallot1.html#03">Note-3</a>).</li> 
  <li>Let cool to room temperature. When cool, cover tightly and 
    refrigerate. The Shallots can be used as soon as they are cool, but 
    will improve with an overnight rest. This pickle will keep up to 1 
    month in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Drain thoroughly before using in a sandwich.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Shallots:</b> It's much easier to use a few 
  large North American shallots than a whole bunch of Asian shallots. 
  Also, the large flakes work better in a sandwich.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Sugar:</b> I strongly favor Zulka's Morena Pure 
  Cane Sugar (product of Mexico) for it's very light flavor suggestive 
  of Southeast Asian palm sugar.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Storing</b> &nbsp; I have a collection of little 
  plastic spacer inserts from various jars of Asian pickles and preserves. 
  They are perfect for keeping stuff down under the brine - it's what 
  they were designed to do.</li>
