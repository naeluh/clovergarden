<h1>Banh Mi - Vietnamese Sandwiches</h1>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh17g.jpg" alt="Completed Banh Mi Cold Cut Sandwich" class=mrg>

<p><span class=bg>Banh Mi</span>	is perhaps the clearest and longest lasting 
legacy of French Indochina (1887 - 1954). Its origin is much clearer 
than that of the other 20th century cross-cultural icon of Vietnam, the 
soup known as Pho.</p>

<p>The French introduced the baguette and other forms of French bread 
to Vietnam in the late 19th century. This was something entirely new, 
as the type of wheat needed for puffy bread was unknown in the region. 
It was originally called "Banh Tay" (French Bread), but by 1945 it was 
called "Banh Mi" (Wheat Bread). So tightly are they associated, Banh Mi 
is also the name of the sandwiches made from this bread.</p>

<p>This page mainly treats Banh Mi sandwiches quickly and easily made 
from Vietnamese ingredients readily available in Los Angeles and Orange 
Counties. That condition may not prevail in some regions. Instructions 
for making many of these ingredients yourself are found in Andrea 
Quynhgiao Nguyen's <i>The Banh Mi Handbook</i>, along with many other 
sorts of Banh Mi than what we have here. We highly recommend this 
book. Ten Speed Press, 
ISBN 978-1-60774-533-4 (hc), 978-1-60774-534-1 (ebook).

<p>In austere North Vietnam Banh Mi began very simply - a small roll 
with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a spread of p&acirc;t&eacute; or a 
little sliced meat. It is in the more decadent South Vietnam, 
particularly Saigon, that the wonderfully diverse Banh Mi sandwiches 
we know today came to be.These sandwiches are made in many ways, with 
an incredible array of fillings, vegetables, pickles, herbs and spices, 
and in the California, home to the largest Vietnamese community 
outside Vietnam, they have become even more diverse.</p>

<h2 class=lrg><u>The Build</u></h2>

<p>Below is a typical assembly for a simple sandwich quickly made from 
available ingredients readily at hand. The photos are from my favorite 
quick Banh Mi, but most Banh Mi follow this same sequence with minor 
modifications as required by the ingredients. With the ingredients 
at hand, the example Banh Mi takes just <u>8 minutes</u> to make, and 
is, in my opinion, absurdly delicious.</p> 


<h2>Bread</h2>
<br><img src="img/bk_frroll04f.jpg" alt="French Roll" class=mrg>
Given the origin of these sandwiches, French baguettes and 
rolls are a natural, but other breads can be used if they have the 
proper characteristics. They should be light and airy, with very thin, 
preferably somewhat brittle crusts and a soft, springy and slightly sweet 
interior. Today, in North America, slider buns, kaiser rolls and toasted 
breads are also sometimes used.
<p>Unacceptable are dense "artisan breads" with thick crusts and strongly 
flavored grains.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Spread <small>&amp;</small> Sprinkle</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh02f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Spread" class=mrg>
First the roll is cut open, but leaving a hinge on one side. I find a 
thin, razor sharp Santoku vegetable slicing knife works far better on 
bread than serrated bread knives. Some crumb may be removed from the 
top half to make room for vegetables.
<p>Next, the entire cut surface is spread with Mayonnaise. After the 
spread I apply a generous sprinkle of 
<a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sa_maggiz.html"><b>Magi Seasoning</b></a> (brown 
splotches) which is included in most Banh Mi sandwiches. I also add 
quite a few dollops of 
<a href="../ingred/cp_huyfong.html"><b>Sriracha Sauce</b></a>. This 
ingredient is included only by personal preference, and, yes, I like 
a lot of it.</p>
<p>---------- &nbsp; In Vietnam, European style salted butter is also 
often used, though Mayonnaise predominates. A newer innovation is to 
spread it with mashed Avocado (once known as "midshipman's butter"). 
Flavored mayonnaise spreads are another alternative.</p>
<p>Home made Mayo is best, at least here in "over regulated" California, 
but more risky in "business friendly" Red States. Nearly all food 
writers agree: the commercial mayo to use is Best Foods "Real Mayonnaise" 
(west of the Mississippi) or Hellmann's "Real Mayonnaise" (east of the 
Mississippi and Canada). In any case, it should be the full fat version. 
Don't worry about it, the "low fat diet" never worked and has recently 
been revealed to have been a secret marketing campaign by the sugar 
industry.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Main Filling Layer</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh04f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Main Filling" class=mrg>
Next goes in the Main Filling. In this case it's Cold Cuts, and in this 
case specifically Vietnamese Head Cheese (Gio Thu). I use various 
Vietnamese cold cuts, and sometimes cod cuts taht aren't Vietnamese - 
depends on what's on hand. For some examples of Vietnamese cold cuts, 
see our page <a href="../ingred/sg_viet.html"><b>Vietnamese 
Sausages</b></a> page.
<p>---------- &nbsp; Many different fillings are used in Vietnam - most 
are cold, but also warm fillings are used. Traditional fillings include 
grilled Chicken, grilled Pork or grilled Beef. Seafood fillings are also 
used. Vietnamese in North America have expanded the fillings list 
considerably, even as far as Andrea Nguyen's Oyster Po'boy, Sloppy Joe 
and Korean Beef and Kimchi Banh Mi.</p>
<p>Vegetarian fillings are available, such as omelet, tempeh and 
mushrooms, whole or sliced. There are a number of tofu products that 
will work, particularly pressed tofu seasoned and baked. For suggestions 
see our <a href="../ingred/bp_tofuz.html"><b>Tofu / Bean Curd</b></a> 
page. Also wheat gluten based products can be stewed, seasoned or 
otherwise prepared for this use. See our 
<a href="../ingred/gr_whtglutz.html"><b>Wheat Gluten</b></a> page.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Vegetable Layer</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh06f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Vegetable Layer" class=mrg>
My vegetable layer is most often just Red Onion, but you can use whatever 
crisp fresh vegetables you'd like, just one, or several.
<p>--------- &nbsp; Other vegetables you can use include thin sticks of 
Carrot and Daikon Radish, sliced Fresno or Jalapeno Chilis, strips of 
red or green Bell Peppers, sliced grape tomatoes, Scallions, etc.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Pickle Layer</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh08f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Pickle Layer" class=mrg>
Some crisp, tangy pickles are added next to round out the blend of 
flavors. My favorite is Pickled Red Cabbage, so it's what I usually 
have on hand.
<p>---------- &nbsp; Many pickles are used. The ones we have recipes 
for here are:
<br><a href="swv_redcab1.html"><b>Red Cabbage Pickle.</b></a>
<br><a href="swv_radcar1.html"><b>Daikon &amp; Carrot Pickle.</b></a>
<br><a href="swv_shallot1.html"><b>Shallot Pickle</b></a>.
<br><a href="cpv_snowvg1.html"><b>Snow Vegetable</b></a> &nbsp; a 
  natural pickle made similarly in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Packaged Asian Mustard Green pickles and European Sauerkraut could 
also be used. Asian markets serving a strong Vietnamese community will have 
jars of various pickles, including Leeks and Shallots that can be 
sliced and used in Banh Mi.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cucumber <small>&amp;</small> Herb Layer</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh10f.jpg" alt="Split Roll with Cucumber and Herb Layers" class=mrg>
Cucumbers are often the last layer, because their thin flatness helps 
you pack down the other ingredients, and helps keep them under control. 
While any kind of cucumber can be used, I always use Persians, which 
need not be peeled or seeded.  Due to our ethnic mix in Los Angeles 
produce markets here always have mountains of these. Because they are 
small I slice them on a sharp diagonal.
<p>Many, many fresh herbs are used in Vietnam. Cilantro is probably the 
most used, but my strong favorite for these sandwiches is Dill. This is 
not "authentic", because the Vietnamese don't usually use Dill raw.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Finished Banh Mi</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh12f.jpg" alt="Finished Roll Closed" class=mrg>
Close it up and you're ready to go!
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Finished and Cut Banh Mi</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh14f.jpg" alt="Finished Roll Closed and Cut" class=mrg>
The sandwich can be cut in half for convenience of serving and/or eating. 
These sandwiches are very well behaved, and their ingredients stay 
inside, so long as you have a reasonably firm grip on them.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Finished and Cut Party Banh Mi</h2>
<br><img src="img/swx_banh16d.jpg" alt="Cut Roll in Clamshell" class=mrg>
<p>
Banh Mi can be made in long thin French baguettes and cut into segments 
for party service. The one described above keeps very well, even 
overnight, packaged in plastic clamshells and refrigerated. Some others 
may not keep as well if they have too much moisture. The 8 x 8 inch 
clamshells are available at Smart and Final and other restaurant 
supply stores.</p>
<p>Again, I use a very thin, razor sharp Santoku vegetable slicing knife 
rather than a serrated bread knife. Serrated knives tend to tear rather 
than cut.
