A refreshing and tonic cold drink very popular throughout Southeast Asia 
and gaining adherents worldwide. Some described the taste as wheat grass 
like. I cannot confirm that - I haven't tasted wheat grass since the 
early '60s.

Pennywort drink should be consumed soon after making it, because the 
bright green color will soon fade. It is available canned in Asian 
markets (see <a href="sxv_pennywort1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>), and some Vietnames 
restaurants may have it fresh as "Rau-ma drink".

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pennywort (Rau-Ma):</h3> &nbsp; Purists may use 
  only the leaves, but at 4-1/2 ounces of leaf per 1 pound bag of 
  pennywort at U.S. $5.00 / pound, I'm too cheap for that. I include most 
  of the stems which are a little sweeter and have a slightly more 
  resinous flavor than the leaves. For details see our  
   <a href="../ingred/py_pennywz.html"><b>Pennywort Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Simple Syrup</h3> is made by heating equal amounts 
  of sugar and water until the sugar is completely dissolved. I prefer 
  palm sugar (by a wide margin) for this drink - 2 oz palm sugar plus 
  1/4 cup of water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Canned Pennywort Drink</h3> &nbsp; I've seen canned pennywort 
  drink variously described as "awful", "wretched", "disgusting" and 
  "atrocious". To verify this I bought a can, Foco brand, (11.8 oz, 
  2020 US $0.99 / can). It was over sweetened to my taste, and. of 
  course, a light greenish brown rather than brilliant green, but it 
  wasn't that bad, and had real pennywort taste. Ingred: Pennywort 
  Leaf extract (40%), Sugar, Citric Acid.
