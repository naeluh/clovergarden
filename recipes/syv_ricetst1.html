This standard Thai ingredient is both a thickener and flavoring. It is 
available commercially in small shaker jars, but it's fresher made 
at home. See also <a href="syv_ricetst1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.

  <li>In an iron pan, dry roast <b>RICE</b> over moderate heat, 450&deg;F 
    to 470&deg;F (230&deg;C to 240&deg;C) stirring and shaking very 
    often, until it has about the color of brown rice, then 
    cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Grind quite fine in your spice grinder. It should be just a bit 
    gritty, rather than soft powder.</li>
  <li>Kept in a tightly sealed jar in a cool place away from light it 
    should be good for 6 months to a year.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweet Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Also known as "glutinous rice" (it contains 
  no gluten) and "sticky rice", this chalky looking rice is available in 
  just about all East and Southeast Asian  markets. It's usually packed 
  in smaller bags because (except in Laos and the Laotian part of 
  northern Thailand) it's used mainly for sweets. First choice would be 
  Thai Long Grain. Second would be Short Grain Sweet (everywhere else). 
  Third choice would be Thai Jasmine, which is not a sweet rice. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Spice Grinder</h3> &nbsp; A little whirling blade coffee grinder 
  is excellent for this job - mine is a Krups.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This powder is most popular in the northeast 
  of Thailand (where much of the population is Lao). Commercially, it is 
  put up in shaker jars, because one of it's main uses is to sprinkle on 
  salads, particularly meat salads, to absorb some of the dressing. It 
  adheres well to other ingredients for various uses.</li>
