A meaty appetizer from Georgia is made from the most flavoful parts 
chicken, the hearts and gizzards. It is quite easy to make, and can be 
made several days ahead without degrading.

<p>The vinegar gives this recipe just the right tartness. See also the 
somewhat more complex <a href="tac_giblet2.html"><b>Giblet Appetizer 
Salad</b></a>.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>GIBLETS</b>. Place in a pan with water to cover well, 
    bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, depending on 
    how tough your chickens were. Drain.</li>
  <li>In a small pan, heat <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Giblets</b> over 
    moderate heat until very lightly browned. This is hard to see, as the 
    giblets are brown, so err to the light side, because the hearts will 
    toughen with too much frying.</li>
  <li>Cut or chop <b>Giblets</b> as desired. I usually slice hearts into 
    3 pieces crosswise, and dice Gizzards about 1/4 inch if I will use 
    them in rolls, otherwise crosswise a bit larger. Some cooks 
    chop both coarse.</li>
  <li>Make sure your <b>WALNUTS</b> are fresh (no rancidity). Grind in a 
    food processor or similar (I use a mini-prep processor) and mix into 
    Giblets.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Place in a mortar along with 
    <b>Savory</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Pound to a paste and mix into Giblets.
    </li>
  <li>Mix <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Pomegranate Seeds</b> into Giblets and 
    give it some time to rest and blend flavors.</li>
  <li>This dish can be kept refrigerated, and will keep for several days, 
    but should be served cool, not chilled.</li>
  <li><u>Serving</u>:  &nbsp; My favorite way of dealing with these is to 
    set out a rectangle of Lavash (Armenian flat bread) and place some 
    Lettuce leaf on top, then the Giblets over the lettuce and roll it 
    up.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<!--ZOOMSTOP-->
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken Giblets:</h3> &nbsp; This should be about equal weights of 
  Gizzards and Hearts. Some liver is allowed, if desired.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Cayenne, but I use 
  Indian Reshampatti, which is not quite as hot, but has much better 
  flavor. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
