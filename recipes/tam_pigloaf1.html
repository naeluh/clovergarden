<p> This is a very simple Muzhuzhi, including only pig feet (the most 
important part) and pork meat - no ears, tails or snouts. You can add 
such things, but don't skimp on the feet.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (11 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>PIG FEET</b> Examine feet for any hairs. If there are 
    some, shave them off with a razor or torch them. Trim <b>PORK</b> 
    of excess fat and cut into largish chunks.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Feet</b> and <b>Pork</b> into a pot. You'll need at least 
    an 8 quart pot here, as they will expand some. Fill with enough 
    water to cover well and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
  <li>When the pot comes to a full boil, let boil 4 minutes, then pour it 
    all out into a clean sink.</li>
  <li>Clean the pot. Rinse the <b>Feet</b> and <b>Pork</b> clean, 
    removing any loose bones. Place back into the pot. Fill with water to 
    cover and bring back to a full boil, then turn down to a simmer 
    and simmer for 3 hours.</li>
  <li>While the pot is coming to a boil, Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in half 
    crosswise. Cut <b>CARROTS</b> crosswise about 3/4 inch thick. Lightly 
    crush <b>GARLIC</b>. Mix into the pot along with all <b>Spices 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>When the pot has simmered 3 hours, fish out all the <b>Feet</b> and 
    <b>Pork</b>, discarding any vegetables that come out with them.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Liquid</b> and use your gravy separator to remove all the 
    fat (see <a href="tam_pigloaf1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Put back on the stove (in 
    a smaller pot) and bring to a high simmer to reduce to a little less 
    than 1/2 its volume.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, debone <b>Feet</b>. There is no delicate way to do this, 
    just get your hands into the job and do it. Try to get all the tiny 
    bones out because they can interfere with slicing your loaf.
  <li>Cut <b>Feet meat</b> into medium chunks.  Shred <b>Pork</b> 
    coarsely. Mix the two together evenly.</li>
  <li>Grease a 7 inch by 11 inch baking dish well. Pack the <b>Meat 
    mix</b> into the baking dish, not too firmly.</li>
  <li>Turn off heat under the liquid and stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and  
    <b>Salt</b>.  &nbsp; <b>WARNING:</b> &nbsp; <u>Do Not</u> add salt 
    with the liquid boiling. It will foam up almost explosively and 
    flood your stove with sticky liquid. This dish will be served cold, 
    so should be noticeably but not excessively salty and vinegary when 
    hot. Adjust as needed.</li>
  <li>Pour still warm <b>Liquid</b> into the baking dish until nearly 
    up to the rim of the dish. Let cool thoroughly. Massage the meat a 
    little to make sure the liquid fully penetrates.</li>
  <li>When fully cool, slip into the refrigerator where it will gel 
    solid. Let it soak in the fridge for some hours, preferably 
    overnight, to make sure it's gelled solid all the way through.</li> 
  <li>If you greased the dish well, you should have no trouble turning 
    the loaf out on to your cutting board. Just run a small knife around 
    the edge, turn it over and tap it firmly on the board.</li>
  <li>Serve sliced as a cold appetizer. It can be served with vinegar 
    dip, mustard or horseradish. It can be kept in a sealed container 
    in the fridge for about 5 days.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Feet:</h3> &nbsp; These should be fresh as sold in North 
  America, not salted as sold in Europe. Those would have to be soaked 
  overnight. Have the meat man cut them in half lengthwise and a couple 
  times crosswise. If already cut both ways into 4 or 6  pieces, that is 
  fine. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_feetz.html"><b>Pig 
  Feet</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fat:</h3> &nbsp; Georgians traditionally like a thin layer of fat 
  on the top, and that is fine for people doing hard labor, but doesn't 
  fit so well with our information society.</li>
