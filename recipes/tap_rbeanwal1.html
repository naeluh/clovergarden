Yum! This appetizer spread is always a hit - but it's hellish filling, so 
use discretion. It goes very well with Armenian Lavash but can be used 
with pita or other breads or crackers.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hours soak and

  <li><u>IF</u> using dried <b>KIDNEY BEANS</b>, soak 8 hours or 
    overnight in water to cover and 1/2 T <b>Salt</b> (yes, salt).
    Drain and rinse well. Place in a sauce pan with water to cover well, 
    bring to a boil and simmer until tender (about 1 hr). They should be 
    tender enough that half will be crushed.</li>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min + overnight)
 <ol start="2">
 <li><u>IF</u> using canned <b>Kidney Beans</b> you will need 3 14oz 
   cans. Drain the beans and rinse.</li>
 <li>Crush half the beans (not too thoroughly) and mix back with the 
   whole beans.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> and <b>GARLIC</b> fine, mix into Beans.</li>
  <li>Make sure your <b>WALNUTS</b> are fresh (no rancidity). Grind in a 
    food processor or similar and mix into Beans.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> small (yes, that's a lot of cilantro). Grind 
    <b>CORIANDER</b>. Mix both  into Beans.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Dressing items</b> into Beans.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate overnight (if possible) to mature flavors.</li>
  <li>Serve at room temperature with Lavash bread. You can make rolls 
    in advance (see enlarged photo), or let guests roll their own. In 
    either case, keep in mind that lavash dries out very fast. You can 
    also use some other suitable bread, or crackers, or squares of 
    Lavash dried into crackers.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Kidney Beans:</h3> &nbsp; Red kidney beans grown in Georgia are 
  reported quite a bit smaller than what we call "kidney beans" here in 
  Los Angeles, so the photo example was made with medium size red beans. 
  They probably grow the big ones now, adopted from Armenia next door. 
  During hard times after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
  Armenians practically lived on red kidney beans sent from Glendale, 
  California.</li>
