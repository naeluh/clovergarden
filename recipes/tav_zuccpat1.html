A flavorful warm appetizer or breakfast dish, and a good way to keeping 
the garden zucchini under control. This recipe makes from 16 to 18 
patties.

<p>Used for breakfast this recipe will serve 3 to 4 depending on 
appetite. Zucchini patties can be made ahead and rewarmed in a 
375&deg;F/190&deg;C oven for about 10 minutes (see <a href="tav_zuccpat1.html#06">
<b>Note-6</b></a>).</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr (hand chopping herbs))
  <ol>
  <li>Grate <b>ZUCCHINI</b> on the course side of your grater. Mix with 
    1/2 t <b>Salt</b> and let stand at least 20 minutes, turning 
    occasionally. Wring out fairly dry.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>EGG</b> and <b>EGG YOLK</b>, then <b>Flour</b> and 1/2 t 
    <b>Salt</b> into  <b>Zucchini</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b>, <b>SCALLIONS</b> and <b>DILL</b> fairly fine 
    and mix into <b>Zucchini</b>.</li>
  <li>Crumble <b>WHITE CHEESE</b> and mix into <b>Zucchini</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat about 1/4 cup <b>Olive Oil</b> in a skillet. Spoon <b>Zucchini 
    mix</b> into the oil in 1 ounce lumps and flatten into patties 
    (<a href="tav_zuccpat1.html#01"><b>Note-5</b></a>). Fry both sides over moderately high heat 
    until browned but not too dark. They should be cooked through, but 
    with plenty of green peaking through.  Add more <b>Olive Oil</b> as 
    needed for frying as you go.</li>
  <li>Drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil and keep warm.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with Yogurt on the side. While not "authentic", I 
    find these go very well with hot sauce.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Zucchini:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer the flavor of Zucchini, but 
  Mediterranean Squash or similar can also be used. they should be 
  medium size, about 2 inches diameter.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Parsley:</h3> Yes, that's a lot of parsley, but not unusual for 
  a Turkish recipe - they treat parsley more like a vegetable than an 
  herb. Use only flat leaf (Italian) parsley.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>White Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; This is similar to Feta. Bulgarian 
  Sirene is sold in North America as "Bulgarian Feta", while the Turks 
  have always called theirs "White Cheese". These are similar to Greek 
  Feta, but different enough that Greek Feta is not considered 
  suitable for Bulgarian or Turkish recipes. The EU gave Greece a 
  monopoly on the name "Feta", so the Danes and others now have to 
  call their "Feta" "White Cheese" as well, in Europe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This should be Pure Olive 
  Oil or Pomace (higher temperature), not virgin which can't take the 
  heat.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; I find the best device for ladling out the 
  zucchini is a regular soup spoon. Scoop up a pile with it, dump it 
  in the oil and push it in round shape, then pat it down flat with 
  your spatula. I usually do 6 or 7 at a time in a 12 inch skillet. Keep 
  the oil under under 400&deg;F/200&deg;C and fry them until browned, 
  not black, with plenty of green peeking through.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; These take time, but can be made ahead and 
  reheated for breakfast. This makes them perfect if you expect she'll 
  stay the night, especially if she's a vegetarian. She's a vegan? Forget 
  it, there's no way you can satisfy a vegan. She didn't stay? You can 
  still console yourself with these in the morning - perhaps with some 
  manly Habanero Sauce instead of the Yogurt (these go really great 
  with hot sauce). Ladies - if you're trying to impress a guy with these, 
  keep that hot sauce in mind (you're not dating a wimp, are you?).</li>
