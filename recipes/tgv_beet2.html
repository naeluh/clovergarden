Beet and Yogurt salads are popular in Turkey, but in Armenia, they have 
been largely replaced by Russian style vinaigrette versions. Stirred up 
a little this one is very colorful.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place the <b>BEETS</b> in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and 
    keep at a strong simmer until they are done. This is when a sharp 
    skewer can be run through the largest one without hitting a hard spot 
    in the middle. Cool in cold water enough to handle them and rub off 
    the skins.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets</b> a little less than 1/2 inch thick and quarter 
    the slices.
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.
  <li>Tumble together all <b>Beets items</b> and set aside for a half 
    hour or more, or chill in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Dressing</u></b>
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and pound with <b>Salt</b> to a paste in a 
    mortar (the salt helps break up the garlic).</li>
  <li>Whip together <b>Yogurt</b> and <b>Garlic</b>. Include a tablespoon 
    or two of water as needed to make a thick but almost pourable 
    dressing.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Serve</u></b>
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Serve <b>Beets</b> topped with <b>Yogurt mix</b> and sprinkle 
    with <b>Nigella</b>. You can also serve it stirred, if you wish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; Buy small beets, around 2 inches diameter, that 
  have at least a stubble of their leaf stems still in place. Beets cut 
  below the stem stubble were probably in storage way too long for good 
  flavor, and will bleed too much of their color when boiled.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; Use a tart natural yogurt, not a heavy or 
  bland one - nor a "low fat", "fat free" or "Greek" one.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Notes:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is derived from one 
  in the famous <i>Moro</i> cookbook. Unfortunately this cookbook shares 
  some flaws with other English cookbooks. Traceability to national 
  derivations are spotty ("spotty" is way better than most English 
  cookbooks though) and it calls for ingredients by size (likely 
  much smaller than here in California) rather than by verifiable 
  measures. I'm assigning this recipe to Turkey, because Yogurt is used 
  with Beets there, and Nigella is used on Yogurt there. They make plenty 
  of beet salads in Morocco, but without yogurt.</li>
