  <li>Optional: &nbsp; Blast <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> and <b>RED CHILIS</b> 
    black with your propane torch. Brush off skins under running water 
    (see <a href="tjv_ajika1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Core and seed <b>BELL PEPPERS</b>. Chop Course. Cap <b>CHILIS</b> 
    but do not remove core or seeds (see <a href="tjv_ajika1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>). Mix.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>CILANTRO LEAVES</b> from the stems. Remove <b>BASIL 
    LEAVES</b> from stems. Measure both as whole leaves packed fairly 
    tight. Mix.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>In your Spice Grinder, grind  <b>CORIANDER</b> and <b>MARIGOLD</b> 
    to powder. Mix with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Start your Food Processor, and add the ingredients in the order 
    given in the ingredient table. You want to make a paste with some 
    texture, not a liquid, so don't run too long.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate overnight, covered. Check seasoning in the morning, 
    adjusting with more Salt, Coriander or Vinegar if needed. Packed 
    in a sterile jar and tightly sealed, this sauce should keep at 
    least a week in the fridge. For longer storage it freezes well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bell Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  does not call for skinning the Bell Peppers or Chilis, but I do it 
  to both, for a more pleasant mouth feel. This is very easy to do 
  with a <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>, but 
  not at all easy without one.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Around here we all use red ripe Fresno 
  peppers, but similar medium hot peppers will work fine.The number of 
  Chilis given makes a sauce that is fairly hot by Southern California 
  standards. If you think they'll make the sauce hotter than you want, 
  partially core them. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cilantro &amp; Basil:</h3> &nbsp; Thai Purple Basil can be used 
  as it is closer to Georgian basil than Italian basil is, and around 
  here it's a lot cheaper. Unlike most of our recipes, the herbs are 
  measured as whole leaves and packed pretty tight. We do this because 
  there are so many, and they will go directly into the food processor 
  with no other chance to measure.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Marigold Petals:</h3>&nbsp; In Georgia, French Marigold (Imeruli 
  Shaphrani - <i>Tagetes patula</i>) is used, but it is not easy to 
  find in North America. Pot Marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i> 
  petals can be found on-line and are a reasonable substitute. The 
  measure is for coarsely powdered. Whole petals are hard to measure, 
  but about 5 times the given amount, lightly packed,  For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/dy_calendz.html"><b>Calendula / Marigold</b></a> 
  page.</li>
