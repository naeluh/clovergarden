  <ol start="5">
  <li>Spin <b>Garlic</b> and <b>Walnuts</b> in a food processor, but 
    not too fine - it should not become a sticky paste.</li>
  <li>With the motor off, add <b>Apricot Pur&eacute;e</b>, <b>Herb

  <li>Let stand about 2 hours for flavors to blend. Serve cool, but 
    not cold.</li>
  <li>Being raw, this sauce is perishable. Packed in a tightly sealed 
    jar this sauce should keep up to a  week in the fridge, but see

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Apricot Leather:</h3> &nbsp; This is thin sheets of dried apricot 
  pulp and juice. It is widely available in markets serving an Armenian 
  or Middle Eastern community (at least it is here in Southern 
  California). If you can't get it, used dried apricots, soak them in the 
  hot water and pur&eacute;e them.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cilantro</h3> &nbsp; You want to have at least 5-1/2 ounces 
  chopped. Given the size of bunches we get in produce markets here in 
  Southern California you need to buy about 1-1/4 pounds.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; This is a mix of Parsley, Dill, Basil and 
  Tarragon (go fairly heavy on Parsley and light on 	the Tarragon). You 
  want to end up with at least 6 ounces, and will have to start with 
  about 14 ounces. You can use a fair amount of stem with the Cilantro 
  and Dill, but not so much with Basil and Parsley, and no stems with 
  Tarragon.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Scallions:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is chopped fine. Use both white and 
  green parts. These are hard to chop fine, so split them lengthwise 
  into halves or quarters before slicing thin crosswise and chopping. 
  You'll want to start with about 5-1/2 ounces.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Here you can control the hotness of the sauce, 
  by varying the amount or type of chili. I use /4 t of Indian 
  Reshampatti, which is fairly hot and has good flavor. This provides 
  just noticeable hotness. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Walnut Oil, but I have 
  my doubts (maybe it was a restaurant recipe). In Georgian households, 
  Walnut Oil is precious, hand massaged out of pounded walnuts by a 
  special technique, and used very sparingly. That yellow oil is a far 
  cry from our purified walnut oil. The main oil of 	Georgia is Sunflower 
  Seed 	Oil, which is reported to be available in much better quality 
  than ours. Olive oil, also very costly to a Georgian household has been 
  suggested as a good substitute (pure olive oil, not virgin) to replace 
  sunflower oil. For this recipe I have used 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive 
  Oil and 3/4 cup Pure Olive Oil quite successfully.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Chopping Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; Nearly all the time is for de-stemming 
  and chopping herbs. I'm really fussy about my herbs, so I pull the 
  leaves by hand and chop fine using a <a href="../ke/kn_mezzaz.html">
  <b>Mezzaluna</b></a>. I don't use a food processor because by time 
  they get the herbs evenly chopped, they are too fine. You may mechanize 
  this process if you choose to accept the disadvantages.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; If four cups seem like too much, make half 
  a recipe, but I'm sure you can find plenty of non-Georgian uses for it! 
  How about with scrambled eggs for breakfast? It survives freezing 
  fairly well, but for good flavor, needs to be warmed to room 
  temperature or warmer before using. I seal it in a 2-mil 	plastic bag 
  and freeze flat and thin so I can use a Chinese cleaver knife driven 
  by a soft faced mallet to cut off however much I want.</li>
