This is Georgia's universal condiment, used with vegetables, chicken 
and especially with grilled lamb or beef - also often used as an 
ingredient in soups and stews.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 minutes)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PLUMS</b> in half and remove seeds (I twist them in half, 
    then use a narrow grapefruit spoon to scoop out the seeds. Place 
    them in a sauce pan with 1/4 c water (I usually cut them in quarters). 
    Simmer covered for 20 minutes or until the plums are very soft. 
    <u>Caution</u>: &nbsp; Use a sauce pan with plenty of head room and 
    take care with the heat, the plums will foam way up near the end of 
    cooking. </li> 
  <li>Separate the pulp from the skins and Pur&eacute;e the plums as 
    needed (see <a href="tjv_plums1.html#04">Note-4</a>).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Place in a mortar with 
    <b>Salt</b> and pound to a paste. Grind <b>Spices</b> in your 
    spice grinder and mix with the Garlic.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Mint</b> and <b>Cilantro</b> very fine. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Put <b>Pur&eacute;ed Plums</b> in a sauce pan. Bring to a simmer 
    for about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasonings mix</b> and simmer 5 minutes or until you 
    have a medium sauce consistency.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Herb mix</b> and take off heat.</li>
  <li>Pack into a jar. In a tightly sealed jar this sauce should keep 
    at least a week in the fridge.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sour Plums:</h3> &nbsp; The tkemali plum (cherry plum) is not 
  readily available in North America, though the tree is grown as a 
  decorative. I have used somewhat under-ripe small yellow plums quite 
  successfully. I also sampled small somewhat under-ripe green plums, 
  but the yellow were just as sour and had better flavor. If you can't 
  get any sour plums, Santa Rosa plums have been recommended, with 
  perhaps a little lemon juice added just before the herbs for proper 
  sourness.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; Here you can control the hotness of the 
  sauce, by varying the amount or type of chili. I use 1 t of Indian 
  Reshampatti, which is fairly hot and has good flavor. This provides 
  about the hotness I want, though some may want a little less (or more). 
  For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mint:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes say the Georgians use Pennyroyal, 
  but it appears what is used is actually a mint thyme that tastes much 
  like penyroyal. Penyroyal is not widely available in North America due 
  to toxicity concerns, and this thyme is not available at all, but 
  Spearmint or similar work well.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pur&eacute;eing Plums:</h3> &nbsp; I have seen photos of just 
  simmered tkemali (cherry plums) as used in Georgia with a lot of tough 
  skins around them. Recipes suggest separating the pulp from the skins 
  with a food mill (an expensive device that, in my opinion, doesn't work 
  very well) or pressing through a strainer using a wooden spoon. With 
  the plums I 	used (not quite ripe yellow plums), you could barely 
  detect the skins at all, so I just ran them in a food processor, and 
  that worked perfectly.</li>
