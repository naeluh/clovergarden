A delicious stew that's very easy to make, with very little frying to be 
done. It will be much liked by people who like cabbage, but will also be 
fine for people who think they don't.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CABBAGE</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your propane torch. Brush 
    off the skin under cold running water. Core and cut into pieces 
    about 3/4 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or sauce pan large enough for the whole 
    recipe (4 quarts or so), heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b>. 
    Over moderate heat fry <b>Chicken</b> just until it's raw color is 
    gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>All Ingredients</b>. Bring back to a boil, cover and 
    simmer slowly, stirring a few times, until Chicken is tender, 
    about 40 minutes. Adjust water as needed - it should end up with a 
    modest amount of liquid but not swimming.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with bread or rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless and boneless. I prefer 
  all thigh and leg meat for better flavor and texture. Also see 
  <a href="tmc_chkcab1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Red Pepper Paste:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard item found in 
  just about every Turkish or Armenian home and available from markets 
  serving those communities. It comes in various degrees of heat from 
  mild to medium. If you don't have it, fake it up with 1T Tomato Paste, 
  1 t Paprika and 1/4 t Cayenne. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html"><b>Chili Sauces &amp; Potions</b></a>
  page.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; In typical English style, the pattern 
  recipe calls for "crushed chili" with no hint whatever as to what kind 
  or how hot. Korean flake, which is very common around here and not real 
  hot will make this recipe very mild. Use your own best judgement. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html"><b>Chili Powders / 
  Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Notes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was written by a Turkish lady 
  now living in Canada, but it is in English style. In other words, all 
  ingredients are called out by quantity, with no hint whatever about 
  size or weight. So how much does "a piece of chicken" weigh in Canada, 
  and boneless or bone in? Skinless or skin-on? I'm making some 
  presumptions here, but I suspect it varies a lot in Turkey anyway.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Note the similarity of the name Kapuska to 
  Polish Kapusta (cabbage). There was plenty of trade between Turkey and 
  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and then the Polish Lithuanian 
  Commonwealth, from the 13th to 19th centuries.</li>
