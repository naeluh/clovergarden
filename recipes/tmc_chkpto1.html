A main dish with a light, fresh taste, especially easy to make because 
the chicken isn't browned. This dish can be served various ways, see

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b>. Cut into 3/4 to 1 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. 
    Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CHILI</b> and <b>BELL PEPPER</b> fairly small (see 
    <a href="tmc_chkpto1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> small. Mix 
    all with <b>Onions</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or 4 quart sauce pan, heat 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Chicken</b> over moderate heat just 
    until it has lost its raw color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>, bring to a boil, cover and simmer slowly 
    for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in <b>All Ingredients</b>. 
    Bring back to a boil, cover and simmer, stirring a few times, until 
    potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Adjust water as needed -  
    it should end up with a fair amount of liquid but not swimming.</li>
  <li>Serve hot - see <a href="tmc_chkpto1.html#06"><b>Serving</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless and boneless. The 
  pattern recipe called for white and dark, but I prefer all thigh and 
  leg meat for better flavor and texture. Also see <a href="tmc_chkpto1.html#06">
  <b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar all purpose potatoes 
  work well here. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes because they turn to 
  mush cooked a little beyond the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili, Mild:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for a Cubanelle 
  Pepper, but we don't have those in Southern California. If available, 
  sweet Hungarian, Armenian or Turkish chilis are similar. If none are 
  available, use the common green Anaheims. They are thicker walled and 
  have more flavor, but they work. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "crushed 
  chili" with no hint whatever as to what kind or how hot. Korean flake, 
  which is very common around here and not real hot, will make this 
  recipe very mild. I use Indian Reshampatti, which is a bit hotter. 
  Use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chilis.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe doesn't call for it, but 
  I always skin the peppers. This improves texture, especially if the 
  dish is reheated - there won't be detached skins floating around. 
  Skinning them is so quick and easy if you blacken the peppers with a 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush off 
  the skins under running water.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This dish can be served alone, or with rice. 
  In Turkey it is often served in open top puff pastry shells. Instead 
  of rice, I have also also mixed in separately cooked small pasta shapes 
  just before serving, but have no evidence they've done that in Turkey.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Notes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe was written by a Turkish lady 
  now living in Canada, but it is in "English style". In other words, 
  all ingredients are called out by quantity, with no hint whatever about 
  size or weight. So how much does "a piece of chicken" weigh in Canada, 
  and boneless or bone in? Skinless or skin-on? I'm making some 
  presumptions here, but I suspect it varies a lot in Turkey anyway.</li>
