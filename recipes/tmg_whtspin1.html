Spinach stems are sweeter than the leaves, and there's certainly no 
need to waste them. This delicious recipe takes some hours, but it's not 
at all difficult.

<p>I'm not sure how this dish is served in Turkey, but I've served it 
with Basmati rice, and that worked well. I've also used left-overs as 
pasta sauce which also worked well.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 hours - 25 min work)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>WHEAT</b> in 1 cup <b>Water</b> for 8 hours or more. Drain and 
  simmer in fresh <b>Water</b> (more water than you think it could possibly 
  need) until tender, at least 1 hour. Use an oversize pot as it'll 
  foam over if you give it a chance.</li>
<li>Rinse <b>SPINACH STEMS</b> and cut into lengths of about 3/4 inch.
  </li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li> 
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
  water and peel. Chop or dice quite small.</li>
<li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol start="5">
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion 
  Mix</b> until Onions are translucent, but no browning.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and cook over moderate heat, stirring 
  occasionally, for about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Chili Flake</b> 
  (see <a href="tmg_whtspin1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Spinach Stems</b> for about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Wheat</b> and <b>Water</b> to almost cover. Simmer 
  tightly covered over low flame until Spinach is tender, about 6 
  minutes.</li>
<li>Serve garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Wheat Grains:</h3> &nbsp; (Wheat Berries, Pelted Wheat) These are 
  whole hulled grains of wheat. The ones I used were labeled "Hulled 
  Wheat, N.D. / for Halim" (Halim is a meat and wheat stew popular from 
  Anatolia to Hyderabad). 1/3 cup will yield 1 cup cooked (easier to 
  make more and measure out a cup cooked).</li> 
<li id="02">
  <h3>Spinach Stems:</h3> &nbsp; 6 ounces is about the amount you will 
  get from one pound of good quality spinach.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 1/2 t sugar at 
  this point, but in my opinion it isn't needed, and this "great evil" 
  in our diets should be avoided wherever it is not really needed.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Aleppo (pul biber (flake pepper) in 
  Turkish) is very flavorful and appropriate to the region. It usually 
  has very little heat though, which will please many people, but not 
  all. If you want more you can add a bit of a hotter chili flake or 
  powder.  For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
