  Way</b></a> for method.</p>
<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 1 hr work)
<br>
<ol>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGES</b>. It is very important to remove the core 
  completely so boiling water can get at the stem ends of the leaves, 
  and for ease of stripping off the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot tall enough to completely 
  submerge a Cabbage. Lower one of the <b>Cabbages</b> in (Carefully - 
  see <a href="tmm_cabstuff1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>) and hold it down with a wooden 
  spoon in the core hole for a few minutes. Swish it around a bit, 
  and when the outer two leaves start to drift away, it's ready. With 
  the burner still on high, hold the Cabbage steady with the 
  wooden spoon. Take tongs and start peeling away the outermost 
  leaves as they start to drift away from the head. Hold each by the 
  stem, gently shaking it loosen and lift it out. Peel until the leaves 
  are getting too small to stuff. Lift out the remaining cabbage 
  and set it aside. Now do the other Cabbage. Keep small and torn leaves 
  aside, and keep some of the cooking water for the broth.</li>
<li>Place each softened cabbage leaf outside up on your cutting board and 
  shave the thick central rib thinner to make the leaf more flexible (see 
  <a href="tmm_cabstuff1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>). This is 
  easiest with the leaf draped over the edge of the board with the stem 
  parallel to the edge.</li>
<li>Grind <b>BEEF</b>, if not purchased ground. It should be ground 
  quite fine, perhaps two passes in a home meat grinder.</li>
<li>Wash <b>RICE</b> very well. Drain Tomatoes and chop fine. Grind 
  <b>Spices</b>. Chop <b>BELL PEPPER</b> fine With your hands, massage 
  together all <b>Stuffing items</b> until very evenly distributed.</li>
<li>Place each leaf inside up, and place a gob of stuffing near the 
  stem end (be generous, but keep in mind the rice will cause significant 
  expansion). Give it one turn, Fold the sides in and roll up. Keep well 
  chilled until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Chop <b>GARLIC</b> fine and mix together all <b>Broth items</b>. 
  Bring to a simmer.</li>
<li>Line the bottom of your chosen cooking vessel with the small or 
  torn cabbage leaves. Proceed appropriately as described in 
  <a href="tmm_cabstuff1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>, placing the <b>Cabbage Rolls</b> flap 
  side down. Pour in <b>Broth</b>, which should nearly cover the Cabbage 
  Rolls (much of it will be absorbed by the rice).</li>
<li>Serve hot.  These rolls reheat very well, or with a little more 
  care if they have been cut.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for one very large 
  cabbage but I prefer two medium (2-1/2 to 3 pounds each) which will be 
  safer to handle, and the leaves are more even in size. Two 2-1/2 pound 
  cabbages will yield about 20 to 24 leaves of suitable size.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lamb / Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, Lamb is the preferred meat 
  in Armenia, though Beef might also used, or a mix of the two. Now, 
  however, in Post-Soviet Armenia, a mix of Beef and Pork or Lamb and 
  Pork might also be used. Pork has displaced Lamb as the favored meat 
  in Armenia, but Lamb is still the favored meat for Armenians outside 
  of Armenia, and pork definitely not used in Turkey.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; In Armenia mostly long grain rice is used. It 
  could be Basmati from India or Pakistan, or a more prosaic long grain 
  rice from that region, but I find Thai Jasmine rice works fine in this 
  recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; A simple tomato sauce is best here. My 
  favorite is Faraon Spanish Style, which comes in convenient 8 ounce 
  cans, but other simple sauces will also work.</li>   
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; There are several ways you can 
  cook the rolls. Cooking times are longer than needed for the rice and 
  meat, but assure the Cabbage Leaves will be tender enough to break up 
  with a fork.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Dutch Oven:</b> &nbsp; 
    Preheat oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C. Arrange the Cabbage Rolls as 
    noted in the instructions, placing them in several layers. Add 
    the <b>Broth mix</b>, it should nearly cover the Cabbage Rolls. When 
    the oven is ready, cover the Dutch oven tightly and bring to a simmer 
    on the stove top. Place in the hot oven and bake for about 45 minutes.
    </li>
  <li><b>Saut&eacute; Pan</b> &nbsp; Arrange the rolls in a spacious 
    saut&eacute; pan, preferably in a single layer. Pour in <b>Broth 
    mix</b>. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly and simmer about 45 
    minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Electric Skillet</b> &nbsp; This is the method I use for 
    parties, because it keeps the stove free. Arrange rolls in an 
    electric skillet, preferably in a single layer, and pour over the 
    <b>Broth mix</b>. Cover tightly and set to just keep the water 
    at an intermittent boil. Cook for 45 minutes, a little less if 
    you'll be reheating the rolls before serving. When done I cut them 
    in half crosswise (easier to handle on a party plate) and carefully 
    stack them back into an electric skillet set to "keep warm", and 
    pour the broth over.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Danger!</h3> &nbsp; You've got a big pot of 
  boiling water and you're dealing with a big, heavy, misbehaving lump of 
  cabbage. Most methods ask you to remove the cabbage to peel the leaves. 
  This is dangerous, as the cabbage is very heavy coming out, and any slip 
  results in a tsunami of scalding hot water. My method, described 
  in the instructions, is far safer, as the cabbage is tiny by time it 
  is taken out. It is also quicker and produces the best quality, 
  evenly cooked leaves.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional cuisines of Armenia and 
  Turkey are nearly identical, except for the introduction of pork to 
  Armenia by the Soviets. I have made some adjustments to the Armenian 
  pattern recipe. To the Broth, I have added tomato sauce and halved the 
  lemon juice called for, as that broth was too plain and too sour. Some 
  other Armenian recipes do include tomato sauce. I have changed how the 
  cabbages are handled for ease, perfect leaves, and especially for 
  safety.(see <a href="tmm_cabstuff1.html#06">Note-6</a>).</li>
