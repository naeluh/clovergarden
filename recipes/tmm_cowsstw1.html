This moderately sour stew has only a modest amount of beef, but is 
spectacularly high in flavor. It can also be made with other meats, 
or with chicken, turkey or goose.

<p>This recipe can be made with or without walnuts, depending on 
preference. The photo example was made with walnuts, and with 
tamarind paste for sourness.</p>

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr )
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into small cubes, 1/2 to 3/4 inch on a side. 
    Remove all excess fat.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix 
    with <b>Tomatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>Grind together all <b>Spices items</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Prepare whatever you are using for <b>Sour Plum</b> as needed.</li>
  <li>IF Using: grind <b>WALNUTS</b> fine (a mini-prep processor works 
    well).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a pot, 3 quarts or larger, place <b>Beef</b> and cover well

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Wight is boneless and with all excess fat 
  removed. One of the tougher stewing cuts or roasts will be fine.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Marigold Petals:</h3> &nbsp; The measure is for finely powdered. 
  Whole petals are very springy and hard to measure, but will be about 5 
  times the amount lightly packed. In Georgia, French Marigold (Imeruli 
  Shaphrani - <i>Tagetes patula</i>) is used, but it is not easy to find 
  in North America. Pot Marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i> petals 
  can be found on-line and are a reasonable substitute. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/dy_calendz.html"><b>Calendula / 
  Marigold</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Powder:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Hot 
  Hungarian Paprika" but doesn't give an amount. I use Indian 
  Reshampatti, which is a little hotter and has good flavor. The amount 
  given will give the dish a just noticeable but not obtrusive  heat. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
  <b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cilantro &amp; Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; Weights given are <u>after</u> 
  removing stems and damaged leaves. 2-1/2 ounces of Cilantro will 
  provide about 3/4 cup chopped fine, and 1-1/2 ounces of Parsley will 
  provide about 1/2 cup chopped fine. Yes, that's a <u>lot</u> of herbs 
  - it's Georgian.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sour Plum:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "1 sheet sour 
  plum leather", without specifying size or weight. Here in Los Angeles, 
  only apricot leather is widely available and it isn't sour enough. 
  Dried sour plums are occasionally available here, but likely not where 
  you are. The pattern recipe gives as an alternative "juice and grated 
  zest (yellow only) of one lemon". A good  alternative used by Georgians 
  in North America is easily available Tamarind Paste. Block form 
  provides the best flavor. 2 ounces cut from a block will make this 
  recipe about as sour as you want it - for details and directions see 
  our <a href="../ingred/bp_tamaz.html"><b>Tamarind</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Prep Time:</h3> &nbsp; Prep time is long, but more than 1/2 hour 
  is for stemming the herbs. This task can be assigned to a lesser 
  skilled person. Chopping them is another 5 minutes or so, and if you 
  have a <a href="../ke/kn_mezzaz.html"><b>Mezzaluna</b></a>, which is 
  relatively safe, you can assign that task as well. If you don't have 
  a mezzaluna, get one - it chops herbs much faster than a chopping 
  knife, and the herbs look better because they are not bruised.</li>
