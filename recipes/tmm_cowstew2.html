A very flavorful, healthy, and economical beef stew. It takes quite a 
bit of cutting in the prep stage, but not a lot of attention while 
cooking. It reheats very well.

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (57 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into cubes, about 1 inch on a side, removing 
    all excess fat.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water and peel. Dice small.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and dice about 1/2 inch on a side. Hold in 
    cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>BELL PEPPER</b> black with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and brush 
    the skins off under running water. Core and dice about 3/8 inch. 
    Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine. Mix both with <b>Tomatoes</b>.</li>
  <li>Remove stems and damaged leaves from <b>CILANTRO</b> and 
    <b>BASIL</b>. Chop fairly fine. You can include smaller 
    stems from the Cilantro. Mix.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hr)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or similar, place 
    <b>Beef</b> and cook covered over low heat, stirring now and then, 
    until it starts to sweat. Continue to braise in its own juices, 
    tightly covered for about 10 minutes, stirring just once. Uncover 
    and turn the heat up to  medium high, stirring now and then until 
    all the liquid evaporates.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Butter</b> and Fry <b>Beef</b> over medium high, 
    stirring now and then until it is lightly browned all over, about 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b> and drained <b>Potatoes</b>. Continue to 
    fry over medium high heat, stirring now and then, for another 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>, <b>Herb mix</b>, <b>Bay Leaf</b>, 
    <b>Stock</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil, 
    cover tightly, and simmer over low heat for about 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Adjust Salt and Liquid as needed. Serve hot, accompanied with 
    steamed rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with all excess fat 
  removed. One of the tougher stewing cuts or roasts will be fine, 
  though I prefer shoulder cuts.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One green Serrano or similar will do fine for 
  most people. I do not know what kind of Chili is used in Georgia, but 
  Serranos have now invaded most of the world. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is after removing stems and chopping, 
  moderately packed. That'll be at least 2 ounces each on the stems.
  Opal Basil (purple) is preferred in Georgia, but Thai Purple Basil 
  and Italian Basil will work well enough. Yes that's a whole lot of 
  herbs - but not unusual for Anatolia and Caucasus, where herbs are 
  treated practically like greens.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for  water, but I use 
  stock because I have plenty on hand and it makes a richer stew. 
  Traditional recipes rarely call for stock, because people had no way to 
  hold it for more than a few hours, though bouillon cubes and powders 
  have become popular. For details on how to keep stock on hand without 
  over-filling your freezer compartment, see our recipe 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Georgia, Armenian / Turkish peppers would 
  likely be used. Even here in the Western Capital of Armenia, these are 
  not reliably available. Mild Hungarian peppers are about the same (the 
  Hungarians got chili peppers from the Turks), as are Cubanelles, but 
  also not reliably available. In my opinion the Green Bell pepper is 
  superior for this dish anyway, but if you don't blast the skin off, 
  dice it no larger than 1/4 inch. Green Anaheim chilis could also be 
  used, sort of half way between the Armenian and Bell Pepper.</li>
