This highly aromatic dolma is certain to please. A bit sweet as a main 
dish (depending on melon) but not cloyingly. Also a good side dish.

<p>This recipe is easy to make and can be done ahead to any point through 
stuffing - see <a href="tmm_dolmamel1x.html#gal"><b>Photo 
Gallery</b></a>. Adjust amounts for the size of your melon.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>See which way your melon sits comfortably and slice off the top just 
    deep enough so you can remove the seed mass. Scrape it out down to fairly 
    firm flesh. Keep the top.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>MEAT</b> of any excess fat and grind (UK mince) or chop very 
    fine (US mince).</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Stuffing items</b>.
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.</li>
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Oil</b> and 
    fry <b>Meat</b> and <b>Onions</b>, stirring until onions are 
    translucent and meat is lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stuffing mix</b>. Bring to a boil, then cover and 
    simmer very slowly until rice has absorbed all the water and is 
    nearly done. Stir once or twice.</li>
  <li>Stuff the <b>Melon</b>. Set the top on and fasten with tooth picks.
    </li> 
  <li>Set <b>Melon</b> in a suitable well oiled pan and bake at 
    350&deg;F/180&deg;C for about 1 hour (for a 5 pound melon), a bit 
    more if the stuffed melon was refrigerated, a bit less for a smaller 
    melon.</li>
  <li>Hoist <b>Melon</b> out of the pan and serve.  This can be done 
    several ways. The entire melon (less top) can be presented at the 
    table and a sharp edged serving spoon used to scoop out stuffing and 
    melon as needed, or individual portions of stuffing and melon can 
    be set up in the kitchen, with melon chunks mixed into the stuffing 
    or on the side.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Melon:</h3> &nbsp; The melon in the photos was a 5-1/4 pound 
  Santa Claus melon (very sweet), the only variety properly ripened at 
  the market that day. Traditionally, a Persian mellon or cantaloupe 
  type with orange flesh or a Hami Mellon would be used, but any 
  reasonably sweet melon with a tough rind will work just fine.
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/melons.html"><b>Melons</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Traditionally, in keeping with their Muslim 
  neighbors, Armenians used lamb or mutton with beef an occasional 
  alternative.  Near Eastern Armenians still stick with lamb, but 
  Armenians in Armenia, ever since their stint as part of the Soviet 
  Empire, hold pork in highest esteem. I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork but 
  all beef would be fine too.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Currents:</h3> &nbsp; Real dried currents are very rare around 
  here, and even in Europe. Zante Currents, actually dried champaign 
  grapes, are common, and work fine. Even small black raisins will be 
  fine.</li>
