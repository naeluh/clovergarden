Once a cheap nourishing stew for the lowest level of Armenian day laborers, 
khash is now a widely popular delicacy in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
In Armenia, Khash is served only in the winter, and with great ceremony 
as a major social event. In Georgia it is served all year round. Khash is 
reputed to have powerful medicinal properties regarding bones and joints 
-  and to enable extended bouts of vodka drinking.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (24 hrs - 
  <ol>
  <li>Put thoroughly cleaned and cut <b>CALF FEET</b> and <b>TRIPE</b> 
    into a big pot and cover well with cold water. Change the water often 
    for between 4 and 8 hours (see <a href="tmm_khash1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Place <b>Calf Feet</b> in a suitable pot, add water to cover 
    and bring to a boil. Skim off any sludge that rises to the surface. 
    The feet will first expand, sticking out of the water, and later 
    soften and sink.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Tripe</b> into about 1 inch squares. In a separate 
    pot bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then discard water and wash pot. 
    Return to the pot with fresh water to cover and a few lemon slices 
    or a little citric acid. Bring to a boil for about 10 minutes. Again 
    rinse and then add to the main pot.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and crush cloves lightly. Add to pot.</li>
  <li>Keep the pot at a simmer for 10 to 12 hours, skimming as needed 
    (see <a href="tmm_khash1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>).</li>
  <li>When cooking time is over, remove the feet from the broth (see 
    <a href="tmm_khash1.html#09"><b>Note-8</b></a> for alternative). Strip all the soft 
    material from the bones and discard the bones. Return the soft 
    material to the main pot. Add <b>Salt</b> to taste.</li>
  <li>Place condiments on the table and serve in individual bowls. 
    See <a href="tmm_khash1.html#07"><b>Note-8</b></a> for serving options.
  <p></p></li>
  <li><b>PACHA OPTION:</b> &nbsp; In a separate pot simmer <b>LAMB 
    TONGUES</b> in water until the skin can be peeled off easily, about 
    2 hours. Peel, remove all fat and cut into small cubes. Add to the 
    main pot when the feet are nearly done. When everything else is 
    completely done, skim some fat from the top of the main pot and use 
    it to fry the <b>CHILI</b> until well incorporated, then stir back 
    into the main pot. If there is no fat use oil.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Calf Feet</h3> (Beef Feet): &nbsp; As sold in California these are 
  thoroughly cleaned, washed and white in color with the outer hoof and 
  all hairs removed. This eliminates at least 60% of the labor 
  traditionally required for khash. Beef feet can be found in ethnic 
  markets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_footz.html"><b>Calf Feet</b></a> page. Have 
  the market saw the feet in half lengthwise and two cuts across 
  (6 pieces).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; As sold in California tripe is thoroughly 
  cleaned of it's green coating, parboiled and pure white. This 
  eliminates another 30% of the labor traditionally required for khash. 
  Smooth or honeycomb tripe can be used (smooth is cheaper). For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Tripe</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cold Water Rinse:</h3> &nbsp; In Soviet Armenia and Georgia, cold 
  water service was free, so people making khash just put the feet and 
  tripe in a big pan and let the water run all night. With the post 
  Soviet introduction of water meters this is no longer practical. 
  American calf feet and tripe are so clean a shorter rinsing with 
  frequent changes of cold water is fine. Sure, the USDA would have a 
  cow if they knew what you were doing, but even if by chance some 
  bacteria did get into this stuff, it's about to be boiled for 10 hours 
  or more.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pacha Option:</h3> &nbsp; This option makes khash a bit more like 
  the Pacha made by Assyrians and Iraqis - but not really that much. 
  See <a href="tmm_khash1.html#10"><b>Note-10</b></a> for details.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Lamb Tongues</h3> may be found in the same markets where beef feet 
  are sold. At my local market they are conveniently packed in trays of 
  six.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Paprika or Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Ground Aleppo chili would be 
  appropriate here (it's mild but tasty). Hungarian paprika can also be 
  used, or some other chili to your preference. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Skimming:</h3> &nbsp; Aside from any crud that rises to the surface 
  I also skim off much of the fat. This is definitely not "authentic", 
  but in today's sedentary "information society" some compromises have 
  to be made.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Serving Options:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Once forbidden, in Armenia and Georgia it is now considered only 
    mildly scandalous for a woman to make khash or participate in its 
    consumption (including the vodka). Probably not in Muslim 
    Azerbaijan.</li>
  <li>In some settings a large bowl will be filled with khash with a whole 
    hunk of the calf foot included. It's up to the diner to fish it out 
    and strip off the edible part, returning that to the bowl and 
    discarding the bones.</li>
  <li>A traditional eating method is for the diner to crumble dried lavash 
    into the bowl until of a consistency where it can be scooped out with 
    fresh lavash - no utensils are used. Today it is popular to skip that 
    step and use a spoon.</li>
  <li>It is up to the diner to add garlic and salt to individual taste. 
    Parsley may also be used.</li>
  <li>Various pickles, radishes, green and yellow peppers are served along 
    with the khash.   Plain khash is sometimes accompanied by a side of 
    Pacha made with lamb tongues and stuffed lamb stomach.</li> 
  <li>Rounds of vodka toasts are made during consumption.  The first 
    toast, before starting to eat, is "Bari Louyus" (Good Morning), since 
    khash orgies usually start in the early daylight hours. The next 
    toast is by the host to the guests and third from the guests to the 
    host. After that it's free association. The khash party ends when 
    no-one is coherent enough to make another toast, and sleeping the 
    day away is the only cure.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Regional Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Azerbaijanis call it <i>kyallya 
  pacha</i> and do not include tripe - nor the vodka since it's an 
  Islamic country. It may also be made from sheep or goat feet instead 
  of cow. Georgians call it <i>khashi</i> and add milk to theirs. They 
  are fine with the vodka though, and don't restrict khashi to the 
  winter months as Armenians do.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Pacha:</h3> &nbsp; This is a closely related potion with a 
  wider distribution in Islamic countries.  It is quite popular in 
  Iraq and among Assyrian Christians, many of whom are now refuges from 
  that country.
  <br>Both groups generally use lamb and goat feet rather than cow feet 
  and cook an entire lamb head in the pot. The Assyrians sometimes omit 
  the head, just using the tongue, or strip and discard the head before 
  serving. Iraqis often serve the whole head and pick the meat off it 
  at the table. If you grew up with an ungulate death's head staring at 
  you from the dinner table you too might be ready to strap on a dynamite 
  bomb.  Alternately the brains may be served on the half skull.
  <br>Pacha also includes sheep stomachs filled with a mixture of rice, 
  ground meat and seasonings sewn into them, sort of a haggis soup, and 
  the intestines are similarly stuffed and included as a sort of sausage. 
  After cooking these major elements may be divided into separate 
  serving trays.
