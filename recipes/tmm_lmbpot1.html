<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; (or Mutton) Weight is boneless and with all 
  excess fat removed. Small bony chunks of lamb or mutton can sometimes 
  be had at a lower price.  After removing the meat from the bones, the 
  bones can be roasted and used to make the stock for this recipe (see 
  <a href="tmm_lmbpot1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Fat trimmings also go in the pot as 
  they will add flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chickpeas:</h3> &nbsp; If you use canned or cooked chickpeas 
  instead of dried, use 2/3 cup and add to the soup with the Potatoes.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lamb Stock:</h3> &nbsp; This should be prepared in advance. Our 
  recipe <a href="tim_lambstock1.html"><b>Lamb Stock</b></a> is 
  excellent for this use. Beef stock can also be used if that's what 
  you have.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well for recipes of this 
  kind. Avoid Yukon Gold or similar because they turn to mush if cooked 
  a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Ghee:</h3> &nbsp; This is fully clarified butter. It is easily 
  found in markets serving an Indian community (be sure it's Butter Ghee, 
  vegetable ghee may be trans fats).  The pattern recipe calls for 
  "Butter", but whole Butter must brown the meat without ever going over 
  300&deg;F/150&deg;C. Ghee is certainly known and used in Azerbaijan. 
  You could also use Avocado Oil or Olive Oil (not virgin) if Ghee is 
  not available.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lavash / Churek:</h3> &nbsp; No Azerbaijani would ever admit that 
  Lavash is of Armenian origin, because Azerbaijanis are very reluctant 
  to admit that Armenia even exists (they have been at war since 1915). 
  Churek is just Lavash with white sesame seeds.</li>
