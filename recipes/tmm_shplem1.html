A mildly tart stew with a tasty sauce. The pattern recipe used bone-in 
lamb shanks, but cubes of meat work better for serving. See also

  <b><u>PREP</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>LAMB</b> into cubes, about 1 inch on a side, removing all 
    excess fat. If you use a mix of meats, cut the beef a bit smaller 
    than lamb or veal for even cooking.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SHALLOTS</b> small.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1 inch chunks. Peel <b>POTATOES</b> 
    and cut into 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>In a large coverable saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir 
    in <b>Lamb</b> and fry stirring until it has completely lost its raw 
    color and all exuded liquid has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Shallots</b> and fry stirring until softened.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Water 
    should just cover the meat, adjust if needed. Cover and simmer slowly 
    for about 1-1/4 hours until lamb is tender (1-1/2 hrs for beef).</li>
  <li>When <b>Lamb</b> is about done, stir in drained <b>Potatoes</b> and 
   <b>Carrots</b>. Add just enough water to almost cover. Bring back to a 
   boil, then simmer covered for about 20 minutes or until vegetables are 
   tender.</li>  
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Make the <b>Sauce</b>. Whisk together 
   all <b>Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce</b> a bit at a time, then simmer stirring until the 
   sauce thickens the stew, about 5 minutes. If you need it a bit thicker, 
   bring it to a boil to reduce the sauce, but don't make it too thick 
   because it will thicken more as it cools. If you have way too much 
   liquid you can strain out the solids and reduce the liquid to avoid 
   overcooking. If you get it too thick, you can loosen it with some 
   boiling water.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with steamed rice, pilaf or pita bread.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb / Meats:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with all 
  excess fat removed. Lamb is fairly expensive here, and by time you 
  remove the bones and fat, the meat costs three times that much - so I 
  usually use a mix of lamb, beef and veal, or even all beef. Only older 
  Turkish cookbooks admit that Turks eat meats other than lamb, but they 
  do.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose work well for recipes of this 
  kind. Avoid Yukon Gold type, because they turn to mush if cooked a 
  little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Labne:</h3> &nbsp; (Kefir Cheese - Turkish <i>Suzme Yogurt</i>) 
  This is yogurt with most of the water drained out. It is available in 
  any market serving a Near or Middle Eastern community, but you can make 
  your own. Suspend twice as much yogurt as labne needed in double cheese 
  cloth overnight in the fridge to drain.</li>
