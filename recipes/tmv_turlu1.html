Often described as "Turkish Ratatouille", this delicious vegetable 
stew was adopted by Sephardic Jews driven from Spain, as It is similar 
to a Spanish Pisto. 
</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
Spanish Pisto is itself derived from the Moorish Albaronia. This recipe 
can easily serve as a vegetarian main dish, or can have meat added 
(see <a href="tmv_turlu1.html#08"><b>Variations</b></a>).

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
<ol>
<li>Trim <b>OKRA</b> caps being careful not to cut into the inside.
  Tumble with <b>Vinegar</b> to coat. Let soak for 30 minutes, tumbling 
  them often (this firms them and prevents sliminess). Rinse and 
  leave whole.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ZUCCHINIS</b> as described in <a href="tmv_turlu1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>. 
  Tip and tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> and cut into 1-1/2 inch lengths. Mix 
  both with Okra.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
  water, peel and cut into 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
<li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
  <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>, and brush off the skins under running water. 
  Cap and seed, then cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 1-1/2 inches 
  long. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Cut <b>EGGPLANTS</b> as described in <a href="tmv_turlu1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>. 
  Hold in cold water acidulated with a little Citric Acid or 
  Lemon Juice until needed.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 3/4 inch chunks. Hold in cold 
  water (no acid) until needed.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> medium. Peel <b>GARLIC</b> and slice fairly 
  thick. Mix.</li>
<li>Remove <b>HERBS</b> leaves from stems and chop small, but not fine.
  Measure is after chopping. Mix all.</li>
<li>Grind <b>Cinnamon</b> and <b>Fenugreek</b>. Mix. (Coriander seeds 
  stay whole and separate).</li>   
<li>Mix together <b>Tomato Sauce</b>, <b>Water</b>, <b>Bay Leaves</b>, 
  <b>Cinnamon mix</b>, and chopped <b>Herbs</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
<ol start=11>
<li>Drain <b>Eggplants</b> and <b>Potatoes</b>. Mix.</li>
<li>In a pan large enough for the whole recipe, heat <b>Oil</b>. Mix in 
  <b>Onion mix</b> and <b>Coriander Seeds</b>. Fry stirring until 
  Onions are translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Eggplant mix</b> until coated with Oil, then stir in the 
  <b>Tomato mix</b>, <b>Tomato Sauce mix</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
  <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer gently for about 
  20 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Zucchini mix</b> and <b>Vinegar</b>. Bring back to a 
  boil. Cover and simmer gently another 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve hot with plain pilaf (or plain steamed rice), with Yogurt on 
  the side. This dish can be reheated if not overcooked.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Zucchini:</h3> &nbsp; If they are 1-1/4 inch diameter maximum, you 
  can just cut them in rounds about 3/4 inch thick. If larger, cut them 
  in halves or quarters lengthwise, depending on how large, then cut into 
  3/4 to 1 inch lengths.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peppers, Sweet:</h3> &nbsp; In Turkey, long narrow  
  &Ccedil;arliston peppers would be used. They are about the same as 
  Cubenelles, thin walled and mild. The Armenian / Turkish peppers sold 
  here in Los Angeles are a little wider, but still thin walled and 
  sweet, but they are sold yellow-green. &Ccedil;arlistons ripen to red, 
  so I used Red Anaheims, with seeds and membranes removed - still a 
  little hotter, but work fine . The four cookbooks I have including this 
  recipe (all published in England) presume you can't get these chilis, 
  so call for red, yellow or green Bell Peppers. Anaheims are much 
  closer. For details, see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"> 
  <b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer thin skinned eggplants that don't 
  need to be peeled. The photo example was made with egg shaped Indian 
  eggplants split lengthwise in quarters and the quarters cut in half 
  crosswise. Long eggplants like Japanese or Chinese can be cut 
  lengthwise in halves or quarters, depending on size, and then 
  crosswise into 3/4 to 1 inch lengths. Globe eggplants have tough 
  skins and need to be peeled, then cut into about 1 inch chunks.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose and similar waxy potatoes work 
  fine. Avoid Yukon Gold type, which disintegrate into mush if cooked 
  a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; Other mixes can be used, such as Parsley and 
  Cilantro. Some Sephardic recipes include no herbs.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Use a very simple sauce. I use Faraon 
  Spanish Style, in convenient 8 oz cans, but other simple sauces will 
  work fine.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; White Wine Vinegar works fine, but Turks also 
  use Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>In Turkey this recipe may be made in Summer and Winter versions. 
    The Summer version may have Artichoke Hearts instead of the 
    Potatoes. The Winter version may have more root vegetables: potatoes, 
    carrots and turnips, and cooked Chickpeas instead of green beans.
    </li>
  <li>Some Turkish recipes include a small amount of meat, cut in thin 
    strips. A few Turkish recipes use a lot of meat, and meat stock 
    instead of water. The meat is usually Veal, which is fried with the 
    Onions.</li>
  </ul>
