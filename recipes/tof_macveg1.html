This is a substantial soup, so if you use it as a soup course, serve in 
smallish bowls. The pita squares do enhance it, but make sure there is 
enough liquid.

<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
<ol>
<li>Clean, fillet and skin <b>FISH</b> (don't try to skin mackerel). Cut 
  fillets into sections about 2 inches long. I do this ahead and freeze 
  the fillets. See <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
<li>Make the <b>FISH STOCK</b> if you haven't already. It should be made 
  from some fish other than mackerel, which is too strong and oily. See 
  <a href="tof_macveg1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min )
<ol start="3">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Cut into 1/2 inch dice.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into 1/4 inch dice. Cut <b>CELERY</b> into 
  1/4 inch dice. Mix.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATO</b> and cut into 1/2 inch dice. Hold in cold water 
  until needed.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>DILL</b> fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
<li>Cut <b>PITA BREAD</b> into squares about 1/2 inch in size. put about 
  1 T <b>Olive Oil</b> in a skillet and fry them until just lightly 
  colored, turning constantly with a thin metal turner. Cool.</li> 
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol start=10>
<li>In a sauce pan or sufficient size, bring 6 cups of <b>Fish Stock</b> to 
  a boil. Stir in <b>Fish Fillets</b>, bring to a simmer and simmer covered 
  for about 12 minutes. Strain stock into a bowl and hold aside.</li>
<li>Chop <b>Fish Fillets</b> fine.</li>
<li>Heat <b>Olive Oil</b> in the saucepan. Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry 
  stirring until Onion is translucent, but no browning.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Carrot mix</b> and fry stirring until for a couple of 
  minutes, then then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Continue to cook, stirring 
  now and then, until liquid is nearly gone.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Fish Stock</b> and drained <b>Potatoes</b>. 
  Bring to a simmer and simmer covered 20 minutes or until all vegetables 
  are tender.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> and all <b>Seasoning items</b>. Bring to a simmer, 
  check seasoning and liquid (see <a href="tof_macveg1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>). 
  Simmer covered for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished as desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Fillets:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 2 to 2-1/2 
  pounds of whole mackerel. This will yield 1 to 1-1/4 pounds of fillets. 
  These will be skin-on for mackerel, but most other fish will need to be 
  skinned. Mackerel is rather strong, so for parties I use 1/3 mackerel 
  and 2/3 a milder fish, usually the ones used for the stock, but for 
  this soup frozen Tilapia fillets would be fine. For details on mackerel 
  see our <a href="../ingred/sf_mackz.html"><b>Mackerel Family</b></a> 
  pages. For other fish see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html">
  <b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page (very large page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish Stock</h3> &nbsp; I will have generally made stock well in 
  advance from fish other than mackerel, and stored it by the long term 
  method described near the end of our page <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">
  <b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>. I favor Golden Pompano and Japanese 
  Amberjack, which are good in soups, and both can be skin-on or 
  skin-off. I freeze the fillets.</li>  
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potato:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose type potatoes work well in soups 
  like this. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes which disintegrate into 
  mush if cooked a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; The proper chili for this 
  region is coarsely ground Aleppo pepper which is flavorful and fairly 
  mild. If you don't have that, crushed Ancho (no seeds) is the best 
  substitute, but Korean or crushed Japones can be used. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Liquid:</h3> &nbsp; If serving with Pita Squares, see that there 
  is sufficient liquid so the soup won't get too thick when they absorb 
  some. The pattern recipe, by a restaurateur, used white bread cubes 
  fried in olive oil. These would need even more liquid.</li>
