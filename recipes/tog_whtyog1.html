This soup is in all my Armenian cookbooks, testimony to its importance.

<p> This is a very filling soup, so few will want more than a cup. It is 
also quite tart. If you feel it seems too tart, some recipes allow up to 
1/2 t of sugar.</p>

<b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs - 5 min work exclusive of 
  making broth)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>PELTED WHEAT</b> in 1-1/2 cups <b>Water</b> overnight or at 
  least 8 hours. Drain.</li>
<li>Make <b>BROTH</b> if you don't have it on-hand.</li>
</ol> 
<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min) 
<ol start="3">
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
<li>Crush <b>Dried Mint</b> so you can measure it, or chop fresh herbs 
  fine (see <a href="tog_whtyog1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="5">
<li>Place <b>Pelted Wheat</b> and <b>Broth</b> in a suitable sauce pan. 
  Bring to a boil and simmer covered until wheat is tender (1-1/2 to 2 
  hrs).</li> 
<li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Melt <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Onion</b> over 
  moderate heat (it's butter), stirring frequently until a uniform 
  golden color. Take off the heat and stir in <b>Mint</b> or Fresh 
  Herbs.  Mix into Pelted Wheat.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat <b>Egg</b> until smooth. Beat in 
  <b>Yogurt</b> until smooth and well distributed.</li>
<li>When Wheat is done, beat some of the <b>Soup</b> into the 
  <b>Yogurt</b>, a bit at a time, until you've stirred in about 1 cup. 
  Stir the <b>Yogurt mix</b> gradually into <b>Soup</b>, stirring 
  continuously until very well blended. Bring the soup up hot, but not 
  boiling.</li>
<li>Serve hot or cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pelted Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; [Dzedzadz (Armenia); 
  Hurled Wheat] &nbsp; This is lightly pearled whole wheat kernels. It 
  is available in markets serving ethnic communities from Turkey 
  through the Caucasus and on into Persia, and is very common here in 
  Los Angeles. Cracked Pelted Wheat [Gorgot (Armenia) / Yarma (Turkish)] 
  is also sometimes used. Pearled Barley can be used as a substitute, 
  but please try to find the lightly pearled version. It is light beige 
  rather than white, and the grains are larger. It has more flavor and 
  behaves much better in cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; [Madzoon (Armenia)] &nbsp; 
  This should be plain, natural, full fat yogurt, no flavors, additives 
  or fancy names.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; In Armenia Beef or Chicken 
  broth is used, but this recipe can be vegetarian by using a vegetable 
  broth. Our recipe for <a href="uov_vstock1.html"><b>Russian Vegetable 
  Stock</b> </a> will work fine, and was used for the photo example.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mint:</h3> &nbsp; Dried Mint is traditional in 
  the region, but some current recipes call for 1/4 cup Fresh Mint or a 
  mix of Mint and Parsley.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Similar soups are made 
  with rice (Printz Tanabour) which doesn't need the pre-soak, and with 
  1/4 inch wide noodles (Dutmaj Abour) which is even quicker.</li>
