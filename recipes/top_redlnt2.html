<p>The one hassle is the pur&eacute;e step, pulling 
out, setting up, using, cleaning and putting away with the food 
processor, but nothing says you can't make it "peasant style" without 
pur&eacute;eing.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min - 7 min work)
<ol>
<li>Wash <b>LENTILS</b>. Place in a saucepan with 2 cups <b>Water</b> 
  and bring to a boil. Skim any foam that may rise to the surface. Set 
  to a simmer until Lentils start to fall apart (15 to 20 minutes). 
  Add water if needed to keep the Lentils submerged.</li> 
<li>Chop <b>FRESH MINT</b> for Garnish.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol start="3">
<li>In a sauce pan of sufficient size for the whole recipe (3 quart is 
  good), heat <b>Butter</b> and <b>Olive Oil</b> over low moderate heat. 
  Stir in <b>Flour</b>, stirring until it is cooked and has formed a 
  roux, then stir in the <b>Mint</b> and <b>Aleppo Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Ajika</b> and stir vigorously for a minute to blend 
  flavors.</li>
<li>Slowly whip <b>Stock</b> into the Roux until it is all smooth, then 
  stir in the rest</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Lentils</b> and bring to a boil over moderate heat, 
  stirring now and then.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Bulgur</b>. Bring back to a simmer for another 5 minutes, 
  stirring now and then to prevent sticking to the pan.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Fresh Mint</b>. Serve <b>Lemon 
  Wedges</b> and <b>Plain Yogurt</b> on the side. &nbsp;  Note: for 
  buffet   service it's better to just stir in the <b>Fresh Mint</b> 
  and a tablespoon of <b>Lemon Juice</b>, serving Yogurt on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Aleppo Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; This is a specially prepared Chili Flake, 
  traditionally very mild and flavorful. I've recently seen "Aleppo 
  Pepper Extra Hot", and though it isn't real hot by Southern California 
  standards, I prefer to use the mild. Due to endless wars in Syria, most 
  Aleppo pepper now comes from Turkey and some is produced in North 
  America. It should be available in markets serving an Anatolian, 
  Caucasian or Eastern Mediterranean community, or on-line.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Ajika:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 1 T of Turkish 
  Red Pepper Paste (<i>Kirmizi Biber Sal&ccedil;asi</i>) plus 1 T Tomato 
  Paste. Biber Sal&ccedil;asi is imperfectly available in most of North 
  America, but Armenian Ajika is certainly available here in Southern 
  California. Traditionally just Peppers, it is commercially made with 
  Peppers and Tomatoes, so it covers both issues. I use Great Masis 
  brand "Hot", which actually has very little heat.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for chicken stock, but 
  if you want to make this vegetarian, use our 
  <a href="giv_stockv1.html"><b>Vegetable Stock</b></a> or similar.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Bulgur:</h3> &nbsp; This is parboiled and crushed 
  wheat which cooks very fast, not cracked wheat. Medium Coarse is #3 
  and Coarse is #4.</li>
