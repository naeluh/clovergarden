In Turkey, Pilafs are usually side dishes, or served as the last dish 
before desert to make sure everyone is stuffed, but this one also makes 
an excellent vegetarian main dish.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 40 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>RICE</b> well. Mix with water to cover and soak 1/2 hour.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>EGGPLANT</b> in stripes so about 1/2 the peel remains.
    Slice about 3/4 inch thick and cut into 1 inch squares. Sprinkle 
    with plenty of <b>Salt</b> and tumble well. Let sit in a strainer 
    to drain for 45 minutes (<a href="tsv_eplric1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).  Rinse 
    and wring out excess water.</li>
  <li>Heat 3 T <b>OIL</b> and fry <b>Eggplant</b> until cooked through 
    but not browned, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels, set aside.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fine.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> (see <a href="tsv_eplric1.html#04"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Brush 
    the skin off under running water, and cut into strips 1/8 by 1 
    inches. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>DILL</b> fairly fine for Garnish.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>ALSPICE</b> and <b>CINNAMON</b>, mix all <b>Spicing 
    items</b></li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + 30 min to 1 hr rest)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>OLIVE OIL</b> in a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan and fry 
    <b>Onion</b> over moderate heat until translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b> and cook about 2 minutes stirring 
    occasionally.</li>
  <li>Drain  <b>Rice</b> and stir in. Cook over low heat about 4 minutes, 
    then stir in <b>Spice mix</b> until well distribute. Stir in 2 cups 
    <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over low heat 15 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Eggplant pieces</b> and cook another 2 minutes, mixing 
    well.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat, stretch a paper towel over the pan and set the 
    lid over it (<a href="tsv_eplric1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). Let sit 15 minutes, 
    then remove the paper towel, stir the rice, stretch a new paper towel, 
    cover and let stand another 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>If desired, mold in an oiled bowl and upset onto a plate. This is 
    how it would be served in restaurants.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with dill and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; All my Turkish cookbooks call for a "long grain" 
  or "extra long grain" rice, or specifically Basmati (an extra long 
  grain rice) or Patna (a long grain rice). The pattern recipe calls for 
  "extra long grain rice", so I have specified Basmati. In actuality, 
  Turks today use various types of rice. Turkish Baldo, a medium grain 
  rice similar to Italian arborio is quite popular for pilavs, and one 
  Turkish lady says Thai Jasmine is the closest to what her family used 
  in Turkey. For Pilavs, the Turks are quite insistent that the rice 
  be washed <u>very well</u>, so the grains stay separate. Easiest way 
  is to place it in a fine sieve and shake it vigorously under warm 
  running water. If using <u>Sella Basmati</u> (par boiled), include 
  an extra 1/4 cup of water in the recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Medium size eggplants such as Italian are 
  preferred, but larger can be used. <b>Salting</b> eggplant does not, 
  as so many cookbooks say, "remove bitter juices". The juces are not 
  bitter, but the salting does shrink the eggplant closer to cooked 
  size and greatly reduces the amount of oil it will absorb.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cubanel Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; This is a thin skinned, thin walled 
  yellow-green "frying" pepper. We don't have them in Southern California, 
  but we can often find Armenian / Turkish peppers or mild Hungarian 
  peppers, all of which are quite similar. If you have none of these, 
  you can use a Green Anaheim Pepper, or, as a last resort, a Green 
  Bell Pepper, but the torch blasting is more important with these 
  (thicker skins).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Towel:</h3> &nbsp; The purpose of the paper towel is to absorb 
  excess moisture from the rice, so it doesn't drip back from the lid. 
  The   pattern recipe called for 2 30 minute rest periods. I used 2 
  15 minute rest periods and it seemed plenty to me. </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; In Turkey, pilavs are often served cold, 
  with just a side of plain Yogurt.</li>
