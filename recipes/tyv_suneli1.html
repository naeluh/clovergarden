The name of this essential Georgian spice powder translates to "dried 
spices". It is applied to grilled meats, fish, vegetables, stews and 
soups. Recipes, of course, vary with household, and even with what's 
for dinner.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fenugreek Leaves:</h3> &nbsp; [Shambe, Methi (Dried, of course)]. 
  &nbsp; Blue Fenugreek (<i>Trigonella caerulea</i>) is used in Georgia, 
  but is very difficult to obtain in North America. The slightly stronger 
  <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> is an acceptable substitute and widely 
  available fresh (at least in Southern California). It is less seen 
  dried, but you can easily dry it yourself. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_fenugz.html"><b>Fenugreek</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Marigold Petals:</h3> &nbsp; In Georgia French Marigold (Imeruli 
  Shaphrani - <i>Tagetes patula</i>) is used, but it is not easy to find 
  in North America. Pot Marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i> petals can 
  be found on-line and are a reasonable substitute. The measure is for 
  coarsely powdered. Whole petals are hard to measure, but perhaps 5 
  times the given amount lightly packed,  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/dy_calendz.html"><b>Calendula / Marigold</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This is included in some recipes, and others 
  use Black Pepper instead (perhaps 1 teaspoon). Use either and vary to 
  your taste. I use 1/4 t of Indian Reshampatti, which is fairly hot and 
  provides a noticeable amount of bite to the powder. Russians consider 
  recipes with hot chili to be "Georgian". For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comment:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is very similar to those by Darra 
  Goldstein and Aliza Green, with some input from other recipes as well. 
  These are quite typical, but feel free to vary to your taste. Do try 
  to include the Marigold Petals and Fenugreek Leaves, which are very 
  typical of Georgia and included in most recipes. Some increase the 
  ground fenugreek seeds to replace the leaves when unavailable, and 
  some include some saffron threads instead of marigold petals. Some 
  recipes include a small amount of Turmeric.</li>
