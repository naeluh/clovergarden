Stuffing eggs is an exercise in frustration - unless you have the simple 
but miraculous tools and techniques that make it so easy.

<p><b>Dill</b> and <b>Parsley</b> are measured after chopping, 
    lightly packed.
  <br><b>All Stuffing</b> items should be chopped quite fine so the go 
    through the pipe easily, but not to mush. I use a Mini-Prep 
    processor for the Onions and Mushrooms.</p>

  <b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil and peel <b>EGGS</b> - for the best method see our 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> page. Even 
    so, start some extras in case some have invisible cracks. Chill 
    peeled eggs well.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Stuffing</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut cold <b>Eggs</b> in half lengthwise and pop out the yolks.
    See our <a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html#cutter"><b>Egg Cutter</b></a> 
    for the best cutting tool.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using fresh <b>Shiitakes</b>, stem them and soak in hot 
    water for 30 minutes. Wring out. This greatly improves their texture.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>MUSHROOMS</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> and <b>DILL</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 3 T <b>Butter</b>. Fry the 
    <b>Onions</b> stirring over moderate heat until light golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in 3 T more <b>Butter</b> and the <b>Mushrooms</b>. Continue 
    to fry stirring until the Mushrooms are cooked through and tender.
    </li>
  <li>Mash together all <b>Stuffing items</b> until very evenly 
    blended.</li></ol>
  <b><u>Toppings</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Beat together <b>Mayonnaise</b> and <b>Sour Cream</b> until 
    smooth.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>RED PEPPER</b> into strips about 1/4 inch wide and 1 inch 
    long.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Stuff, Garnish and Serve</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="12">
    <li>Pack <b>Stuffing</b> into a 
    <a href="../ke/ke_pipebg1.html"><b>Pastry Bag</b></a> with a 1/2 
    inch round nozzle. Pipe stuffing into egg halves, domed a 
    bit higher than the tops of the Eggs.</li>
  <li>Top each Egg with the <b>Mayonnaise mix</b>.</li>
  <li>Garnish Eggs with a strip of <b>Red Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>If you need to hold the finished eggs for awhile before serving, 
    even overnight, see <a href="uad_eggmr1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Serve cold or cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I use fresh Shiitakes as they are probably 
  somewhat like Russian mushrooms. If you use them, note the soaking 
  step. My second choice would be the small King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms 
  now easily available here in Southern California. If necessary, use 
  White Mushrooms.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods Real 
  (west of the Mississippi), as most food writers agree.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Roasted Red Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Jars of flame roasted peppers can 
  be found in the pickles section of most markets. These days they are 
  often from Bulgaria, which is fine. Alternatively, you could blast a 
  red bell pepper black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
  <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>, brush off the skin and steam it until almost 
  as tender as the canned variety.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Holding Stuffed Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; Get a stack of 8 x 8 inch clear 
  plastic clamshells with hinged lids from a restaurant supply (see 
  <a href="uad_eggmr1x.html#clam"><b>Clamshell</b></a>). I get them 
  from Smart &amp; Final. These will neatly hold 12 stuffed egg halves 
  per clamshell - but they are so flimsy they invite disaster (trust me). 
  Nest two clamshells. Arrange the eggs, then close and snap the lid of 
  the inner clamshell. use scissors to cut off the lid of the outer 
  clamshell (it won't snap securely). Refrigerate level.</li>
