This intensely flavorful dish is famous in Russia as a <i>zakuska</i> 
(appetizer) dish, and justly so. With a few more potatoes it also makes a 
very fine main dish.

<p>This recipe takes a little attention to make, but is well worth it. 
This dish reheats well if the sauce is fairly loose, you keep the heat 
low low, and you used the right potatoes.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol>
<li>From <b>BEEF KIDNEYS</b>, remove all membranes and any obvious 
  plumbing. Carefully trim off all the fat (a few small flakes won't 
  hurt). For detailed istructions see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html">Beef / Veal Kidneys</a> page.</li>
<li>Slice <b>Kidneys</b> about 1/4 inch thick and soak for about 1/2 hour 
  in several changes of cold water.</li> 
<li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Put them in 
  a saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil and simmer until just 
  cooked through. Drain.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
<ol start="5">
<li>Drain <b>Kidneys</b> very thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels.
  </li>
<li>Mix together <b>Flour</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Dredge 
  <b>Kidney Slices</b> in the <b>Flour mix</b> to coat very lightly - 
  emphasis on "very ligtly" - too much and you will have too much sauce 
  and it will be week in flavor.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan melt 1/4 cup <b>Butter</b>. Stir in 
  <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry stirring over fairly high heat just until they 
  start exuding moisture, about 4 minutes. Remove them to a bowl.</li>
<li>In the same pan, melt the other 1/4 cup <b>Butter</b> and bring it up 
  until it just starts to brown. Stir in the <b>Kidneys</b> and fry stirring 
  almost constantly over very high heat until all water they exude has 
  evaporated and they start to brown. Make very sure the substantial fond 
  that forms in the bottom of the pan does not burn at all - it should remain 
  a reddish brown. If it looks too dark, stop, even if the kidneys show no 
  browning. Add the <b>Kidneys</b> to the <b>Mushrooms</b>.</li>
<li>Pour about 1/2 the <b>Madeira</b> into the pan and keep it over low heat, 
  scraping the pan with a wooden spatula until all the fond has dissolved. 
  Stir in the rest of the <b>Madeira</b> and the <b>Stock</b>.</li>
<li>Return <b>Kidneys</b> and <b>Mushrooms</b> to the pan. Simmer gently 
  for about 15 minutes, keeping the pan covered or uncovered to regulate 
  the consistency of the sauce. It should be fairly lose because it still 
  has to coat the Potatoes.</li>
<li>Just before serving, stir in the <b>Potatoes</b> and simmer until they 
  are warmed through. Check <b>Sauce</b> for seasoning (it may need a little 
  more salt).</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Kidneys</h3> &nbsp; These can be pretty hard to find in 
  supermarkets these days, but markets serving a Russian or Eastern 
  European community are a good bet. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef / Veal Kidneys</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for tiny new 
  potatoes, boiled and peeled, but I seldom have those on hand - so I 
  peel and cut up White Rose potatoes. Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes 
  which tend to turn to mush if cooked much beyond the minimum. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Madeira:</h3> It is the light colored Madeira that is used for 
  cooking, not the deep red of "Have a glass of Madeira, my dear" fame. 
  San Antonio Winery makes a suitable light colored California Madeira.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Either beef or chicken stock can be used.
