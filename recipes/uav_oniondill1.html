A fine appetizer you can make days or weeks ahead. These are a lot more 
flavorful and less sharp than the familiar pickled cocktail onions.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a rolling boil. Pour in <b>ONIONS</b> and 
    blanch over high heat for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes (depending on size). 
    Immediately quench in cold water.</li>
  <li>Cut off the stem end of each <b>Onion</b>, then cut as little as you 
    can from the root end, not much more than the roots themselves, so the 
    onions hold together well. Peel off the papery outer layers.</li>
  <li>Place <b>All Items</b> <u>except</u> the <b>Onions</b> in a large 
    sauce pan and bring to a boil. Pour in the <b>Onions</b> and bring 
    back to a boil for 4 to 7 minutes, depending on size, to barely cook 
    through.</li>
  <li>Let cool covered for just a couple of minutes, then pour into sterile 
    jars and turn down the lids tightly. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate for a few days before using, if you can. Refrigerated, 
    they'll keep for several weeks, months if the jar hasn't been opened.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tiny Onions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  1 pound pearl onions from a jar, but those are scarce and expensive around 
  here, and even raw in mesh bags they're a bit more than I want to pay (and 
  a real pain to peel because you need so many to make a pound). I pick 
  through a bin of boiling onions, selecting the smallest ones, generally 
  less than 1-1/4 inch diameter. Because I'm starting with raw onions my 
  method is a bit different from the pattern, and they'll be well flavored 
  in a shorter time. You need 1-1/4 pounds to yield 1 pound peeled.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Cider vinegar is called for by the 
  pattern recipe, and it is appropriate, but I confess to often using a 
  premium quality Philippine cane vinegar which I always have on hand 
  (and prefer).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Northern and Eastern Europeans like things a lot 
  sweeter than I can stand, and I consider sugar a "great evil", so I 
  have cut the amount of sugar in half from the pattern recipe. Feel free 
  to adjust to your own taste.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dill:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe allows 1 t dried 
  dill if fresh is not available, but I always use fresh for better flavor.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; Nothing too hot. Korean 
  works fine. For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili 
  Page</a>.</li>
