Buckwheat makes a flavorful and easy to make "cereal", though it's the 
seed of a plant related to rhubarb, not a grain. This dish is a fine 
breakfast for two, or a side dish with meats for four.

does not properly mean "Buckwheat", raw or roasted. It applies to any 
grain cooked in water or milk.</p>

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> unroasted <b>BUCKWHEAT:</b> in a cast iron skillet, dry 
    roast Buckwheat, stirring until it is fragrant and darkens just a 
    couple of shades.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>EGG</b> (<a href="ubg_buckwheat1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>), 
    wipe your pan with just enough oil to coat. Bring it up moderately 
    hot and stir in <b>Buckwheat</b>. Pour in <b>Egg</b> and very quickly 
    stir to thoroughly coat the Buckwheat with Raw Egg. Fry stirring 
    until Egg is set and dry.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>WATER</b> to a boil in a tightly coverable pan (I use a 
    2 quart saut&eacute; pan), add <b>Salt</b> and <b>Butter</b>, then 
    stir in <b>Buckwheat</b>. Bring back to a simmer, cover tightly and 
    simmer for 15 minutes or until all free water is absorbed, then turn 
    off the heat and let rest, covered, another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Fluff with a fork and serve with fresh ground <b>Pepper</b>, 
    soft <b>Butter</b>, and garnished as desired (photo has chopped 
    dill).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Buckwheat:</h3>  &nbsp; Roasted buckwheat is the most available 
  form here in Southern California, and will do fine. Select a brand 
  that is roasted to a rather light color.  Some Russians prefer to 
  roast their own. Unroasted is harder to find, but Asian markets here, 
  particularly Korean markets, often have it. Using unroasted, you must 
  roast it yourself or it will likely become mushy when cooked. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_buckz.html"><b>Buckwheat</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Egg:</h3> &nbsp; Coating with egg and frying before adding liquid 
  will produce an end texture with a little more adhesion than without 
  the egg. I find it not worth the greatly increased bother during 
  clean-up.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Variations</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Bacon:</b> &nbsp; Start out with some bacon 
    diced small instead of butter. Fry it half crisp and add to the 
    roasted buckwheat in place of the butter.</li>
  <li><b>Mushroom Kasha:</b> &nbsp; See our recipe 
    <a href="usg_bukwhtm1.html"><b>Buckwheat Kasha with 
    Mushrooms</b></a>. </li>
  <li><b>Porridge:</b> &nbsp; Cook over fairly high heat uncovered until 
    all water is absorbed. Add 2 cups milk and cook slowly over low heat 
    for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Fried:</b> &nbsp; Fry the buckwheat in oil or lard in place of 
    the butter, then stir in some chopped onions and celery. Fry stirring 
    until onions are soft and proceed as above.</li> 
    </ul>
