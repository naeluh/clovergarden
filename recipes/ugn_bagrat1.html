This excellent salad is actually the famous Russian <i>Salat Oliv'ye</i> 
(Olivier Salad) but with Pasta rather than Potatoes. It is named for 
Pyotr Bagration, hero of the Napoleonic Wars.

<p>That this salad is named after Prince / General Pyotr Bagration 
doesn't mean doesn't mean he ever actually tasted it - lots of things 
are named after him in Russia.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (12 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cook <b>PASTA</b> the usual way in lots of boiling salted water, 
    being careful not to overcook. Drain and stir with a few drops of 
    Olive Oil to keep it from sticking together. Let cool and place in 
    a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Boil <b>EGGS</b> very firm. Remove the yolks for this recipe and 
    just eat the whites with a little salt.</li>
  <li>Cut cooked <b>CHICKEN</b> (Turkey will also do) into about 3/4 inch 
    dice. Cut <b>Ham</b> into slightly smaller dice and add both to the 
    bowl.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> small (white and green) and add to the bowl 
    along with <b>Peas</b>.</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> and chop medium. Add to the bowl.</li>
  <li>Core <b>APPLES</b> (either red or green will do) and chop medium 
    (do not peel). Add to the bowl</li>
  <li>Force <b>Egg Yolks</b> through sieve and whip them with 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> until smooth, then whip in all other <b>Dressing 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Dressing</b> into the mixing bowl with everything else. 
    Refrigerate overnight (if possible), and serve cold.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; This should be small short pasta. Small elbow 
  macaroni will do.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peas:</h3> &nbsp; If you use fresh peas, boil them for for 5 
  minutes in salted water. In Soviet Russia, canned peas would be used - 
  in fact, to accurately reproduce Soviet cuisine is the 
  <u>only</u> legitimate use for canned peas. OK, they are also useful 
  for accurately replicating American "cuisine" of the Eisenhower era. 
  Any market serving a Russian community will have several imported 
  brands.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is "pits in" (3 ounces for pitted 
  olives). These should be Mediterranean oil cured black olives, not 
  the canned California black olives - unless you <u>really</u> want 
  to replicate Soviet cuisine. Be aware, olive pitters are totally 
  worthless, just whack firmly with the side of your prep knife and 
  pull out the pit.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's Real (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods 
  Real (west of the Mississippi), as nearly all food writers agree.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Sauce</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe fails completely in not 
  specifying what kind of chili sauce, and the 1/4 cup called for seems 
  excessive for general usage. I'm specifying a much smaller amount of 
  Tabasco Sauce, which works well.</li>
