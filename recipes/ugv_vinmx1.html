<p>It is best to do the Prep section the day before or at least some 
hours before so everything has time to cool thoroughly. Obvious from 
the quantities, this recipe is scaled for parties. Particularly good 
if there are likely to be vegetarians attending.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min work - 1-3/4 hrs cooking - 3 hrs cooling)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> just until done through. Cool them under cold 
    water enough to handle and rub off the skins. Cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets</b> about 3/8 inch thick and cut into 3/8 inch 
    dice.</li>
  <li>Thaw <b>PEAS &amp; CARROTS</b>, drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/8 inch dice. Place in 
    cold salted water, bring to a boil and simmer until cooked through. 
    Strain out and cool with cold running water. Drain well and set 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Hard cook <b>EGGS</b>. See our method 
    <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> for best 
    results, but even so, start a couple extras in case some have 
    invisible cracks. Shell them and cool thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PICKLES</b> into 1/4 inch dice.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>BEANS</b>, rinse and drain well (presuming canned).</li>
  <li>Pit <b>OLIVES</b> (if needed) and chop fairly small.</li>
  <li>Cool everything really well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="10">
  <li>Mix together the <b>Beans</b>, <b>Capers</b> and all the 
    <b>Diced Items</b>, mixing in the <b>Potatoes</b> last.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Eggs</b> into 3/8 to 1/2 inch dice. Preferably use a 
    wire cutter - see the Wire Egg Cutter at the bottom of our 
    <a href="../ke/ke_eggprc.html#cutter"><b>Egg Tools</b></a> page.</li>
  <li>Gently mix the <b>Eggs</b> into the Salad. Use your hands to 
    prevent breaking up as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Mix together all <b>Dressing Items</b> and gently mix into 
    Salad, again with your hands.</li>
  <li>Garnish as desired and serve cold (see <a href="ugv_vinmx1.html#06">
  <b>Serving</b></a>).
  </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peas &amp; Carrots:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe uses these the 
  authentic Soviet way, Peas, Carrots and Beets out of 
  cans. Unless you really want Soviet authenticity, we strongly suggest 
  the frozen mix of Peas and Diced Carrots, and fresh Beets.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work very well in 
  salads, and work well peeled and diced before cooking, which makes 
  things much easier. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kidney Beans</h3> &nbsp;  We do use these out of a can for 
  convenience, but select a brand where the beans are quite intact. 
  The example photo is with Goya brand.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Black Olives</h3> &nbsp; These should be natural Mediterranean 
  Olives, not the black California type. I use medium size Kalamatas 
  which I can get pre-pitted.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods 
  (west of the Mississippi), as nearly all food writers agree.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; For a formal Russian serving, reserve 1/4 
  cup or so of the dressing. Place salad in a bowl and  smear the top 
  with dressing. Decorate with egg slices or wedges and black olives. 
  My dill garnish works fine for informal buffet services.</li>
