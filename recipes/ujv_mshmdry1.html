<p>In Russia they might use Bolitus (Porcini), but those are scarce and 
expenive in North America, and take an ovenight soak and boiling. 
Here we're using Chinese dried black mushrooms. I presume the Russians 
have them too.</p>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for about an hour. Drain and 
  squeeze out, reserving the soaking liquid.</li>
<li>Chop <b>Mushrooms</b> fine. Dice them with a knife, then finish in a 
  mini-prep food processor or similar.</li>
<li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine and mix with mushrooms.</li>
<li>In a sauce pan melt 1 T <b>Butter</b> and stir in <b>Flour</b>. Fry 
  stirring over gentle heat until the flour has lost its raw taste and 
  starts to color about one shade, then stir in <b>Soaking Liquid</b> 
  starting with just a little at a time until you have a smooth (though 
  very thin) sauce.</li>
<li>Simmer the <b>Sauce</b> down to a little more than 1 cup. It should 
  still be very thin as it has to coat all those mushroom bits.</li>
<li>In a skillet melt 3 T <b>Butter</b> and stir in <b>Mushroom mix</b>. 
  Fry stirring over moderate flame for about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Mushroom mix</b> into <b>Sauce</b> along with <b>Salt</b> 
  and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Check liquidity and correct with boiling water if needed. Check 
  seasoning and adjust if needed.</li>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Dried Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Black mushrooms are available in just 
  about any market stocking Asian supplies. They are actually dried 
  Shiitakes. For details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html">
  <b>Fungus</b></a> page. Vegans be aware, mushrooms are much more 
  closely related to animals than to plants, we have a common ancestor.
