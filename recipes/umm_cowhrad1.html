This is a delicious and very substantial stew - and don't worry about 
the large amount of horseradish, it really tames down in cooking.

<p>There is so much sauce and it is so intensely flavorful, I usually 
stir in chunks of boiled potato just before serving.</p>

<b><u>Do Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 to 6 hrs - 20 min work)
<ol>
<li>Make your beef stock from bones and shank if you don't have any on 
  hand.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs - 1 hr work)
<ol start="2">
<li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into cubes about 1 inch on a side or a bit larger if 
  you desire.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> Fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and 
  chop fine. Mix.</li>
<li>In a large heavy skillet, heat <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>BEEF</b> over 
  moderate flame until nicely browned on all sides, but not so brown as to 
  harden it. Remove from the skillet.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Onion mix</b> into the pan and fry over moderate heat until 
  onions are soft.</li>
<li>In a coverable stew pot or similar, smooth the <b>Onions</b> on the 
  bottom and spread the <b>Beef</b> over them.</li>
<li>Use the <b>White Wine</b> to deglaze the skillet over moderate heat, 
  then pour it into the pot along with <b>Beef Broth</b> and 
  <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer slowly until Beef is 
  tender, about 1-1/2 hours depending on toughness.</li>
<li>Strain the liquid out, keeping both liquid and solids.</li>
<li>Return the liquid to the pot and reduce to about 2-1/2 cups at 
  a fast simmer.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, melt <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Flour</b> until it's 
  raw flavor is gone, making a blonde roux. Stir in the strained broth, 
  at first a little at a time, then more, until you have a thickened 
  sauce at a light simmer. Stir in the <b>Horseradish</b> and 
  <b>Mustard</b> and simmer a few minutes more. Season to taste with 
  <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li> 
<li>Slowly stir in <b>Sour Cream</b>, but do not let the sauce come to a 
  boil.</li>
<li>Return <b>Beef</b> and <b>Vegetable mix</b> to the original pot. Pour 
  <b>Sauce</b> over and bring up hot through, but not to a boil.</li>
<li>Serve garnished with <b>Chopped Parsley</b>.</li>
<li>Reheating must be done 
  with a little extra liquid, over very low heat with frequent stirring 
  to prevent caking to the bottom of the pan. It should not boil once it 
  has sour cream in it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all bones and excess fat removed. 
  Stew meat or a roast from the tougher parts of the cow will do fine.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Horseradish:</h3> &nbsp; Use a prepared horseradish containing 
  nothing but horseradish, salt and acid (usually vinegar) - no cream. If 
  you can get fresh horseradish root you can make your own following 
  our recipe <a href="gjv_hradish1.html"><b>Horseradish &amp; 
  Sauces</b></a>.</li>
<li id="#03">
  <h3>Mustard:</h3> &nbsp; Of course Hot Russian Mustard would be 
  appropriate, but Dijon will do in a pinch.</li>
<li id="#04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose potatoes are good, cubed about 
  3/4 inch and simmered until cooked through. Serve separately or stir 
  in just before serving (a particularly good idea if it is served as 
  a buffet dish). Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes because they turn to 
  mush if cooked a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
