These delectable burgers are never served in buns. The patties 
are fried somewhat rare and served garnished with Petit Pois. 
In Russia, that means Canned Peas, but we can do better.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min + 45 minutes to boil beets)
<ol>
<li>IF you grind your own <b>BEEF</b>, be sure it is very cold going 
  into the grinder.</li>
<li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> until cooked through and a sharp skewer passes 
  through the center without hitting a hard spot. Drain, chill enough 
  to handle in cold water and rub off the skin. Chop fine.</li> 
<li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine, the white and about half the 
  green.</li>
<li>Mix all <b>Patties items</b> until well distributed. Form into 
  6 oval patties.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min + 8 min per pair of patties)
<ol start="5">
<li>For Garnish, In a small saucepan, melt 1 T butter and briefly fry 
  the <b>Peas</b>, until they taste good. Keep warm.</li>
<li>In an iron skillet, melt <b>Butter</b> and stir in <b>Oil</b>. Bring 
  up to a moderate frying temperature, (around 325&deg;F/165&deg;C - 
  you've got butter in there).</li>
<li>Fry patties somewhat rare. Holding the temperature between 
  290&deg;F/145&deg;C and 325&deg;F/165&deg;C (yes, I use an infrared 
  thermometer) fry 4 minutes on one side, then 4 minutes on the other.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Peas</b></li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef, ground:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  calls for ground Top Round, but that seems way too lean to me - maybe 
  they just didn't have decent beef in Moscow when the recipe was 
  written. What I used for the photo example was 2/3 70% ground beef 
  and 1/3 moderately fatty pork, and it was Delicious! Why did I use 
  that exact mix? Because that's what I had left over from another 
  project.</li>
<li id="02"><h3>Petit Pois:</h3> &nbsp; [Small New Peas] &nbsp; 
  In Russia, "Peas" usually means "Canned Peas". I use regular frozen 
  peas for better color and flavor. but you may be able to find frozen 
  petit pois.</li>
