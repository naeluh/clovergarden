<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; It is always best to buy 
  your fish whole (the only way you can be sure you're getting the kind 
  of fish you're paying for), and the heads, fins, bones, and sometimes 
  skins can be used to make excellent fish stock. You can have the fish 
  man scale and clean the fish (done free in all the Asian markets here 
  in Southern California). For details see our recipe 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  1/2 pound Cod or Haddock or thick white fish, and 1/2 pound Sea-bass, 
  Plaice or non-oily fish of choice. None of the named fish are common 
  here in Southern California. The fish you choose should be ones 
  that hold up well in wet cooking. The photo example was done with 
  two of my favorites, Golden Pompano and Japanese Amberjack. I have 
  also made it with Catfish and Tilapia because that's what I had on 
  hand. Yes, they have those in Russia.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Leeks:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for whole 
  leafy Leeks. You will use only the white and light green parts, 
  totaling about 4 ounces. Use the greens for soup stock or whatever.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp;  These should be fairly sour Dill Pickles, 
  as they are supposed to sour the soup. They should not be stirred 
  in until the Potatoes are partially cooked as acid hardens potatoes.
  </li>
<li id="#06">
  <h3>Sorrel:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for leaves only, no stems. Float 
  wash. Spinach could be used instead, and is much easier to find here 
  in Southern California. If using Spinach, select a bunch with adult 
  leaves, baby spinach has insufficient flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cn_sorrelz.html"><b>Garden Sorrel</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; My build is a bit different from the pattern 
  recipe, as I so often serve buffet style. She poached the fish in the 
  Fish Stock as the first step, removing it when done. She served by 
  placing pieces of fish in individual bowls and ladling some of the 
  soup over. She also cooked the potatoes separately (didn't say what 
  kind), and thickened the soup with a roux made of 1 T Butter and 1 T 
  Flour. I feel these steps are redundant. In the usual English 
  style, she called out all vegetables except potatoes by number of 
  pieces with no indication of size, so the weights given here are 
  my best estimates.</li>
