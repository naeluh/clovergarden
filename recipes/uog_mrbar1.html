<b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 to 6 hrs, depending on choice)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the <b>STOCK</b> if you don't already have it. If your stock 
    is robust like ours (see <a href="uog_mrbar1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>), dilute 4 
    cups with two cups water. For weak stocks, use 6 cups stock.</li>
    </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - exclusive of making stock)
<ol start=2>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch dice. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice crosswise about 3/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>DILL</b> small.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. If using our Russian Vegetable Stock 
    you will need 2-1/2 Tablespoons.</li>
  <li>Chop together <b>DILL</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> (flat leaf) for 
    Garnish (this garnish works really well with this soup). </li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr to 2 hrs)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot, melt 2 T <b>Butter</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> until translucent, but no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, <b>Carrots</b> and <b>Dill</b>. Drain 
    <b>Potatoes</b> and add to the pot. Stir in <b>Barley</b> along with 
    <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil 
    and simmer covered until Barley is tender, about 1 hour - more like 
    1-1/2 hours if using lightly pearled barley (see 
    <a href="uog_mrbar1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile:</u> &nbsp; In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, Melt 4 T 
    <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Mushrooms</b>, stirring, until they soften 
    and start to give up their water. Set aside.</li>
  <li>When barley is tender, stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and simmer another 
    10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b> and take off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Dill</b> and <b>Parsley</b> .</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; In Russia, Beef Stock is usually used (see our 
  recipe <a href="uom_beefstock1.html"><b>Russian Beef Stock</b></a>), 
  but a good vegetable stock can be used (see our recipe 
  <a href="uov_vstock1.html"><b>Russian Vegetable Stock</b></a>), 
  and that would have to be used during the Eastern Orthodox Lent, which 
  would also require replacing Butter with Sunflower Seed Oil. Our stocks 
  are pretty strong, so this recipe cuts them with 2 cups water, since 
  the barley will absorb a lot of water.</li>
<li id="#02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These can be regular White Mushrooms, but 
  I strongly recommend at least half be the small King Trumpet mushrooms 
  that have become common here in Southern California. I hope you can 
  find them where you are, but large King Trumpets could also be used. 
  Note that in Russia, 1-1/2 ounces of dried Mushrooms, usually Bolitus 
  (Porcini) would likely be used instead of fresh. They are a standard 
  pantry item in Russia, but are scarce and expensive here in North 
  America. For details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html">
  <b>Fungus</b></a> page. Vegans be aware - mushrooms are much more 
  closely related to animals than to plants, we have a common ancestor.
  </li>
<li id="#03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, which hold together well 
  for this sort of usage. Avoid Yukon Gold type which turn to mush if 
  cooked just a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Barley</h3> &nbsp; Regular white pearled barley has a problem - 
  it sticks to the bottom of the pan and burns there if you don't watch 
  it very closely, especially on reheating. We avoid this problem by 
  using a very lightly pearled barley. Its grains are larger and beige 
  rather than white. It does take longer to cook.</li>
