This recipe produces not only boiled beef but also plenty of stock to 
be used in Russian soups. The beef is often cubed and used in the same 
soups.

You may want to make your soups smaller, but it's just as easy to 
make the whole 3 quarts of stock and refrigerate or freeze what stock and 
meat you don't need now. A 3 pound lump of beef will yield maybe 1 pounds 
10 ounces of cooked meat.

  <p><b>White Stock</b> is made as instructed here.
  <br><b>Red Stock</b> is made by chunking the meat large and frying it 
  brown, then add the vegetables and fry until onions are golden before 
  adding to the pot.
  <br><b>Yellow Stock</b> is made the same as White Stock but fry the 
  vegetables until lightly browned.
  <br><b>Meat Variations:</b> You could use a meaty ham bone in place of 
  some of the beef and/or beef bones. Other meats can be added as well.
  </p>
<ol>
<li>You'll need at least an 8 quart pot for this recipe.</li>
<li>Crack the <b>BEEF BONES</b> into pieces if you haven't had the 
  supplier saw them up (<a href="uom_beefstock1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
<li>Blanch and rinse both <b>BEEF</b> and <b>Beef Bones</b> so your stock 
  will be clear. To do this put them into a pot with plenty of water to 
  cover, bring to a boil for 3 minutes, then pour it all out into a clean 
  sink. Clean the pot and rinse any remaining scum off the meat and bones.
  </li>
<li>Put the <b>Beef Bones</b> <u>only</u> into a pot with 4 quarts 
  (16 cups) of fresh cold water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer 
  slowly for  at least 2 hours - 4 or more is better. Keep the beef 
  refrigerated until needed. Keep in mind that the slower you simmer 
  the clearer your stock will be.</li>
<li>Meanwhile: slice <b>LEEKS</b> thick crosswise, including the green 
  part. Chop <b>CELLERY</b> coarse. Cut <b>CARROT</b> and <b>PARSNIP</b> 
  into disks. Mix together all <b>Vegetable items</b>.</li>
<li>When the bones have simmered long enough, return the <b>Beef</b> to 
  the pot along with <b>Vegetable mix</b>, bring to a boil and simmer 
  until meat is tender (1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours depending on size and 
  cut).</li>
<li>Pull <b>Beef</b> and cool. When cold it can be sliced and eaten with 
  horseradish, mustard or cucumber sauces, fried with onions and served 
  with sauce, used in sandwiches or diced for soups.</li>
<li>Strain out and discard all solids from the stock and de-fat. 
  (see <a href="uom_beefstock1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
<li>Add cold water to bring back to 3 quarts, bring to a boil briefly. 
  Stock can be refrigerated for a 5 days or so, or can be frozen for up 
  to a year. For more convenient storage see 
  <a href="uom_beefstock1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; The Beef should be purchased in big chunks. Many 
  recipes call for Brisket. I usually use a Chuck Roll Roast which local 
  markets have reliably and at a good price. Top Round roast is a little 
  too lean, but it'll work well enough. Tough cuts are best here for 
  flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Bones:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for "marrow bones", but 
  what we generally find in markets here is "soup bones" which can be 
  pretty solid. If you buy a large bone, your vendor should be asked to 
  saw it into chunks for you. This avoids heavy cleaver work - otherwise 
  see <a href="uom_beefstock1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Leeks:</h3> &nbsp; Onions could also be used, but leeks make a 
  better stock.</li>
<li id="#04">
  <h3>De-fat:</h3> &nbsp; Use your gravy separator. It'll take several 
  batches so pour off only 2/3 of what's in the separator before 
  refilling to keep fat out of the pour spout. An alternate to the gravy 
  separator is to refrigerate the stock overnight to solidify the fat 
  layer, then peel it off, but I'm more into immediate gratification - 
  besides, who has that much room in their fridge?</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Storing Stock:</h3> &nbsp; To have stock on hand if it is not to 
  be used right away and you don't have freezer space, do this. Bring 
  the de-fatted stock up to a boil. Let it cool a minute then pour into 
  jars (I use sauerkraut or pickle jars) and cover tightly. Let the 
  jars cool on the counter. Confirm they have a good seal and place 
  them in the fridge. I prefer lids with dimples that click down when 
  cool so I can be certain the seal is good. Sealed this way the stock 
  will keep for months in the fridge.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Breaking Bones:</h3> &nbsp;If you do break bones, don't try to do 
  it "freestyle" using a cleaver like a hatchet - you'll have bones 
  flying all over the kitchen. Use a sharp meat cleaver. Carefully place 
  the cutting edge against a bone, and  drive it with a soft face 
  mallet. See our <a href="../ke/kn_cleavz.html"><b>Meat Cleaver</b></a> 
  page for details and method.</li>
