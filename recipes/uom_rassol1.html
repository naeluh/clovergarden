You can't get much more Russian than this soup - and it's delicious too. 
Normally you start by making a batch of Russian Beef Stock, but other beef 
stocks will work.

<p>You can serve a bowl of sour cream to be mixed in as desired by 
individual diners, but this soup can stand on its own too. If kidneys 
just aren't your thing you could try sausages.</p>

<b><u>Do-Ahead:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 to 6 hours - 30 min work)
<ol>
<li>Make the <b>BEEF STOCK</b> if you don't have it on hand.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
<ol start="2">
<li>From <b>BEEF KIDNEYS</b> remove all membranes and any obvious plumbing. 
  trim off as much of the fat as you can.</li>
<li>Put <b>Kidneys</b> in a pot and cover with plenty of cold water. On high 
  heat bring to a rolling boil (uncover before it boils or it'll foam over). 
  Pour out the water, rinse the kidneys and clean all the scum out of the 
  pot.</li> 
<li>Cover the <b>Kidneys</b> with fresh cold water and bring to a boil 
  again, and again drain, rinse, and clean the pot.</li>
<li>Put the <b>Kidneys</b> back in the pot with a third change of cold water, 
  just enough to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Reserve 2 cups of the kidney cooking water. Drain <b>Kidneys</b> and dice 
  into about 3/8 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium, chop <b>CELERY</b> medium, dice <b>TURNIP</b> 
  about 1/2 inch. Mix all.</li>
<li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 1/2 inch.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b>, cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Hold in cold water until 
  needed.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop <b>PICKLES</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> 
  small. Mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>DILL</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
<ol start="12">
<li>Into an adequate pot, pour <b>Beef Stock</b>, reserved <b>Kidney Water</b> 
  and <b>Kidneys</b>. Bring to a simmer.</li>
<li>In a saut&eacute; pan heat 2 T <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b>, 
  stirring over moderate heat until onions are light golden. Stir in 
  <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Tomato Paste</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>. Fry stirring 
  until Tomatoes are soft. Add all to the pot and simmer for about 1/2 hour.
  </li>
<li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and add to pot along with <b>Pickle Juice</b>. 
  Bring to a boil and season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.  
  Continue simmering for 20 minutes or so until the potatoes are thoroughly 
  cooked.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Dill</b> and <b>Parsley</b>. Serve 
  <b>Sour Cream</b> on the side for any who want it.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Stock:</h3> It's best to start this soup by making a batch of 
  <a href="uom_beefstock1.html"><b>Russian Beef Stock</b></a> which 
  takes 4 to 6 hours, but not a lot of attention most of that time. 
  Of course you can use beef stock made by other methods too. Once you 
  have the stock it takes about 2 hour to make this soup.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Kidneys</h3> can be hard to find these days. Markets serving 
  a Russian or Eastern European community are a good bet though. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_kidnez.html">
