<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Stock:</h3> &nbsp; It's best to start this soup by making a 
  batch of <a href="uom_beefstock1.html"><b>Russian Beef Stock</b></a>, 
  which takes 4 to 6 hours but not a lot of attention most of that time. 
  You can use Beef Stock made by other means.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; If you've made the Russian Beef Stock, you have 
  a nice lump of cooked beef to use for this recipe. Otherwise use any 
  meat that's been cooked tender.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; This is an optional ingredient, about half 
  the recipes include it and half don't. Russia is a land of mushrooms 
  and dried Bolitus (Porcini) are common in the pantry, but in North 
  America, dried porcini are very expensive and usually not on hand. 
  Chinese black mushrooms (actually dried shiitakes) can be substituted 
  with some difference in flavor. 4 medium Shiitakes is about 3/8 ounce.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> &nbsp; A good fresh kraut of the sort they put up 
  in plastic bags, or a good Polish kraut from a jar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The "Do Ahead" section take about 4 to 6 
  hours and a few hours resting time, but very little actual work. The 
  making of the soup takes about 1-3/4 hour plus resting time, but less 
  than an hour actual work.
