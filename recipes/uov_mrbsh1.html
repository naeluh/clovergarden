<b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (13 hours - 20 min work)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>DRIED MUSHROOMS</b> in warm water for 4 hours or more 
   - see <a href="uov_mrbsh1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
<li>Bring <b>Mushrooms</b> to a boil in their soaking liquid. Take off 
  the heat and let them soak overnight in the liquid.</li>
<li>Drain <b>Mushrooms</b>, retaining the <b>Liquid</b>. Adjust the 
  <b>Liquid</b> back to 2 cups.</li>
<li>Chop <b>Mushrooms</b> fine and return to the <b>Liquid</b>. I use 
  a Mini-Prep processor.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine and add to the <b>Liquid</b>.
<li>Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer slowly 1/2 hour. Set aside until 
  needed.</li>
<li>Cook <b>BEETS</b> and rub off the skins (see 
  <a href="uov_mrbsh1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).
  </li>
</ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (37 min)
<ol start="8">
<li>Slice <b>Beets</b> a little less than 1/4 inch thick and cut into 
  square strips about 1-1/2 inches long. Tumble them with 1 t 
  Vinegar.</li>
<li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> into about 1/8 thick strips, or however you 
  like.</li>
<li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Chop 
  <b>CELERY</b> small. Mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>DILL</b> small.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> medium for Garnish</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 minutes)
<ol start="13">
<li>In a 3 quart or larger sauce pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
  <b>Onion mix</b> until Onions threaten to color.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil and stir in 
  <b>Beets</b>, then <b>Mushrooms</b>,  <b>Bay Leaf</b> and <b>Dill</b>.
  </li>
<li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer until vegetables 
  are just tender.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped <b>Parsley</b> and with 
  <b>Sour Cream</b> on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms, dried:</h3> &nbsp; In Russia, "Dried Mushrooms" 
  presumes Porcinis (Bolitus), and they are preferred for this recipe - 
  but, see <a href="uov_mrbsh1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
<li id="#02">
  <h3>Mushrooms, fresh:</h3> &nbsp; A good choice would be fresh 
  Shiitakes, but, after cutting them, soak in hot water for 20 minutes,
  then wring them out. This greatly improves their texture. Another good 
  choice would be the small King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms now easily 
  available here in Southern California. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Soaking Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Russian recipes presume Bolitus 
  (Porcini) which are unusually reluctant to soften in soaking. If you 
  must use some other mushroom, such as dried Shiitakes, you can cut the 
  soaking times back very significantly. The pattern recipe calls for 
  pouring the liquid into a vacuum bottle to keep it warm overnight. I 
  don't have one of those so I leave the pan on a warm spot on my stove.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cooking Beets:</h3> &nbsp; I just boil them in water to cover 
  (about 20 min). Some insist on oiling, wrapping in foil and roasting 
  in the oven (425&deg;F/218&deg;C - about 50 minutes). Either way, they 
  are done as soon as a sharp skewer passes through the largest without 
  hitting a hard spot in the center. Cool under cold running water just 
  enough to handle them and rub off the skins. Cool.</li>
