Nettles are a plentiful wild herb in many regions, and are popular, 
especially in soups, in many of those regions. They are highly nutritious 
and high in protein for greens.

<li>Hard cook <b>EGGS</b> for garnish (if using - they are traditional). 
    See our method <a href="gbd_eggboil1.html"><b>Boiling Eggs</b></a> 
    for best results, but even so, start a couple extras in case some 
    have invisible cracks and blow out. Shell them and cool thoroughly.
    </li>
<li>Make the <b>STOCK</b> if using (plain water can be used, see 
  <a href="uov_nettl1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="3">
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute. Quench in cold 
  water, peel and cut into about 1/2 inch chunks.</li>
<li>Float wash <b>NETTLES</b> as you would Spinach. Bring plenty of 
  Water to a boil and stir in <b>Nettles</b> for 1 Minute. Drain and 
  refresh under cold running water.</li>
<li>Chop <b>Nettles</b>, leaves and tender stems fairly small. Discard 
  fibrous stems, ones that don't break cleanly.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in 
  cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Chop <b>DILL</b> and <b>SORREL</b> fairly small. Cut Scallions 
  into about 1/2 inch lengths. Mix all.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="8">
<li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and place in a 3-1/2 quart or larger pot along 
  with <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered about 12 minutes.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Nettles</b>. Bring back to a boil and 
  simmer covered until Potatoes are cooked through (about another 12 
  minutes).</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Sorrel mix</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back 
  to a simmer.</li>
<li>Cut <b>Eggs</b> in half lengthwise.</li>

  Serve <b>Sour Cream</b> on the side, if using.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Stinging Nettles:</h3> &nbsp; These are becoming more available 
  in Los Angeles, found in Farmer's Markets and markets serving a 
  Russian / Eastern European community. There is no substitute for this 
  soup. Select young nettle tops that have tender stems and haven't set 
  a lot of flower buds - though the bunch used for the photo example did 
  have a lot of buds and some large stems, but it worked OK.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sorrel</h3> &nbsp; This is not easy to find here in Los Angeles. 
  Its shelf life is fairly short, so only markets serving a Russian or 
  Eastern European community are likely to have it. Spinach could be 
  used, but is a bit more tart. Some use Kale in soups of this sort, but 
  it takes much longer cooking and should go in with the Tomatoes, or 
  earlier depending on variety.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work very well in 
  soups. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes which disintegrate into mush if 
  cooked a little longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Any light stock you like can be used, including 
  Vegetable stocks. Even plain water works quite well. Bouillon Cubes and 
  the like can also be used, or Vegeta for vegetarians.</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some older recipes include pieces of sausage 
  in this soup. If you do that, use a good quality kielbasa, and not too 
  much of it. Put it in with the Tomatoes.</li>
