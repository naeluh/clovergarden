Making vegetable stock fell out of favor in Soviet Russia, but with 
the Soviet Union dissolved, many people are again observing the Eastern 
Orthodox Great Lent. For details see <a href="uov_vstock1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id=01>
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Russia is a land of 
  mushrooms, and dried Bolitus (Porcini) are common in the pantry, but 
  they are very expensive here and usually not on hand. Chinese black 
  mushrooms (actually dried shiitakes) can be substituted with some 
  difference in flavor. 6 medium Shiitakes is about 3/4 ounce. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id=02>
  <h3>Oil</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 4-1/2 Tablespoons of 
  Butter, but I have specified Oil in keeping with increasing observance 
  of the Eastern Orthodox Lent. For Lent, it will have to be Sunflower 
  Seed Oil, the only cooking oil not on the prohibited list, but, being 
  a Pagan, I use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). Use your own preference 
  here.</li>
<li id=03>
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example was made with dried 
  Shiitakes. Made with Porcinis it would be <u>much</u> darker. 
  This stock is both quite strong and a bit sweet. Water may need to be 
  added, and in a soup recipe with ingredients that absorb water, such 
  as grains or pasta, water will definitely need to be added to 
  compensate. This stock is also noticeably sweet, but if that's a 
  problem a little lemon juice will fix it. Note that no Salt is 
  included, as that is properly added to the recipe the stock is used 
  for.</li>
