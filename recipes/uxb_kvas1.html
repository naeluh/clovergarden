This is a very traditional beverage in most Slavic countries, 
particularly Poland, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Serbia. It is also 
popular in the Baltic countries, in the Caucasus, and in Western Asia. 
It is called "non-alcoholic", but will have 0.5% to 1% alcohol. This 
recipe makes the real thing - commercial products in North America 
are faked up - more like soda pop, and too sweet. In this recipe yeast 
eats just about all the sugar, so it has a touch of sour.

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 or 7 days - 1 hr work)
<ol>
<li>dry <b>BREAD</b> until entirely crisp, in a 200&deg;F/93&deg;C 
  oven, in a Dehydrator, or by other means. Some people toast the 
  bread dark for a darker brew.</li>
<li>Bring 6 quarts <b>Water</b> to a boil in an 8 quart pot. As soon as 
  it boils, take it off the heat and stir in the bread, gently, but 
  getting it all wet. Cover loosely and let it sit in a cool place for 
  8 to 10 hours.</li>
<li>Strain the liquid from the bread through a fine strainer or by some 
  other means. Gently squeeze liquid out of the bread - not too hard or 
  your Kvass will be cloudy. Clean the pot. Return the strained liquid to 
  the pot. When returning the liquid I strain again through a very fine 
  strainer purchased from an Asian market.</li>
<li>Bring 1/4 c <b>WATER</b> to a temperature of 110&deg;F/43&deg;C. Stir 
  in the <b>Yeast</b> and 1/8 t of the <b>Sugar</b>. Let proof for 10 
  minutes or until foamy.</li>
<li>Stir the <b>Yeast</b> into the strained <b>Liquid</b> along with  
  1 cup <b>Sugar</b>. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Cover loosely 
  and set in a cool place for 8 to 10 hours.</li>
<li>Strain the liquid again through a fine strainer. Place in a clean 
  glass or plastic jar. Add the <b>Raisins</b>. Cover with plastic wrap 
  secured with a rubber band. Set aside in a cool dark place for 4 to 5 
  days. It is ready when the yeast has settled out and the liquid is 
  almost clear.</li>
<li>When the yeast sediment has settled to the bottom of the container, 
  carefully pour off the clear liquid without disturbing the sediment 
  (yes you will get some of it - see <a href="uxb_kvas1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>). 
  Strain out the <b>Raisins</b>. Pour it into clean bottles and 
  refrigerate. I use Gerolsteiner Mineral Water bottles with their 
  original caps.</li>

<li>Serve chilled</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rye Bread:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a high 
  quality dark rye bread with no oils or fats in the ingredients list.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yeast:</h3> &nbsp; What was used here is one 
  packet of Fleischmann's Active Dry Yeast (Original). Various brewing 
  yeasts could also be used with some difference in flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This beverage is consumed 
  with various amounts of the sediment stirred up. Some sediment is not 
  objectional and increases the vitamin content of the brew. Fruits 
  other than Raisins are often used, as are herbs, such as Mint.</li>
