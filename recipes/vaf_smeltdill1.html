have a problem with that - so - recipes.

<p>These smelts can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, reheat well, 
and can be used as an ingredient in sandwiches. They're substantial 
enough to make a light dinner for two served with some boiled potatoes.
<p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (45 min)
  <br>See <a href="vaf_smeltdill1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> 
  for details.
  <ol>
  <li>Head and gut <b>SMELTS</b> (if not already done).</li>
  <li>Dry <b>Smelts</b> on paper towels if needed. Keep them and the 
    working surfaces as dry as you can as you work.</li>
  <li>With a razor sharp filet or boning knife make a cut on the belly 
    side from front to tail and through to the backbone.</li>
  <li>Flatten <b>Smelts</b> by running your thumbnails down both sides of 
    the backbone from front to tail to strip the flesh from it - then slip 
    your knife under the backbone just forward of the tail and strip it 
    out with a single stroke. Bend it away and cut it off at the tail.
    </li>
  <li>Pull feathery fronds of <b>DILL</b> from the stems and chop small.
    </li>
  <li>Lay a <b>Smelt</b> skin side down and distribute a moderate amount 
    of dill all along the center. Place a similar size fillet over it, 
    skin side up, to make a sandwich. Repeat.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Mix <b>Rye Flour</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Pour onto a 
    plate.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>EGG</b> lightly and pour into a deep plate.</li>
  <li>Using one hand for the eggs and the other for the flour, dip each 
  <b>Sandwich</b> into the <b>Egg</b>, shake off excess and drag both sides 
    in <b>Flour</b>, again shaking off excess.</li> 
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a well seasoned skillet (use a little more if 
    the skillet is very large) and fry <b>Smelts</b> on both sides over 
    moderate until medium brown. Drain on paper towels and keep warm (if 
    serving warm).</li>
  <li>Serve warm or room temperature with a vinegar dip.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Smelts:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for head off, guts out. Frozen 
  smelts work fine and headless ones are usually gutted.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Why sandwiches? Why not just put dill 
  on a single fillet and fold it over? Because when you fry it it'll open 
  up. Sandwiches stay flat. If you wanted you could split them into two 
  after frying.</li>
