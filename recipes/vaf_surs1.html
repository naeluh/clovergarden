In Sweden, consumption of this appetizer is reserved for special 
occasions - particularly parties where the guests will be sufficiently 
intoxicated. The product is regulated by the Swedish government to assure 
quality, and that it is properly fermented before shipment. For more 
detail and history for this product, see our 
<a href="../ingred/sf_surstz.html"><b>Surstr&ouml;mming</b></a> page.

The product 
in these photos was canned in July, 2019 and shipped to me in November 
2019. The can was a bit swollen then, but the photo to the left was taken 
just before opening in February 2020. The "Best Before" date is clearly 
shown as Feb 2021. Given condition of the can in Feb 2020, I presume that 
is the expected detonation date.

<h3>The Surstr&ouml;mming Can is Ready</h3> 
<p>Here the Surstr&ouml;mming can is ready to be opened, and in keeping 
with tradition, this is properly done outdoors. A good stable flat rock 
a little ways from the doorway seemed just the right place for this.

<h3>The Can is Now Open</h3>
<p>
I first just made a puncture with the can opener, and waited a while for 
the hissing and bubbling to subside. I then continued with the can opener 
to completely remove the lid. The opener did balk at the creases in the 
lid, and if the Surstr&ouml;mming had been aged for a few months longer, 
more violent tools may have been required to fully remove the lid.</p>
<p>One producer recommends that all participants at a Surstr&ouml;mming 
party gather close around at the opening of the can and deeply inhale 
the aroma. The producer says this will so stun the olfactory nerves 
the odor will not be noticed afterwards. I severely doubt this work, as 
I was very close when I opened the can, and the strong aroma continued 
to be evident. The smell was not as bad as I had been prepared 
for, but then, I'm accustomed to East and Southeast Asian preserved 
fish products, especially those made from salted anchovies, digested 
by their own enzymes.</p></td>

<h3>The Table is Set, and Surstr&ouml;mming is Served</h3> 
<p>Traditionally, Surstr&ouml;mming is served out of doors. It is 
normally eaten smeared on bread, so plenty of good bread needs to be 
available. The most standard accompaniments are Slivered Red Onions, 
Potatoes, Sour Cream, and Beer - plenty of Beer - or Schnapps - but 
probably both.

<h3>A plate with Surstr&ouml;mming on Bread, dressed with Onions</h3> 
<p>Here we have a slice of bread, smeared with Surstr&ouml;mming and 
dressed with Onions, Potatoes on the side. The Surstr&ouml;mming isn't 
very visible because it's about the color of the bread, and at this age 
there's very little solid in the can, except bones, so it pretty much 
just soaks in. I discarded the backbone, but the myriad of tiny ribs 
and pin bones were not really noticeable.

<h3>Yes, I did eat it!</h3> 
<p>I ate that whole slice of bread, including the small piece still on 
the plate in the photo. And surprise! It tasted just like it smelled. 
Like an extremely pungent fish spread with undertones of organic 
solvents. It's actually fairly similar to the murky Vietnamese fish 
sauce <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfishsauce.html#mamnem"><b>Mam Nem</b></a>, 
though that is made with an adequate amount of salt, so is a whole lot 
less smelly, and it's used as an ingredient rather than spread on 
bread.</p>
<p>No, I didn't get sick from this, there were no tremors or 
hallucinations. My only concern is that in the future, when I eat 
a slice of multi-grain bread, or fried potatoes, will the taste of 
Surstr&ouml;mming come bubbling up from my subconscious?</p>
<p>One thing I did do after this adventure, was to hose down that rock I 
opened the can on. I was pretty sure every raccoon for miles around was 
now on full alert, just waiting for the sun to go down.
