A very popular appetizer or first round Sm&ouml;rg&acirc;sbord dish in 
Sweden. It can be a light supper, and is often served as a 
last dish before guests head home.  Be aware of a 
<b><u>major translation error</u></b> (<a href="vaf_temptjan1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>)!

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into thin strips or grate coarse. I 
    use a julienning vegetable peeler and just peel them into thin strips. 
    Keep in cold water until needed to prevent browning</li>
  <li>Split <b>ONIONS</b> in half lengthwise and slice very thin 
    crosswise. Fry stirring in a little oil until just wilted (no 
    browning). Some recipes call for this, others just use the onions raw.
    </li> 
  <li>Lift <b>SPRATS</b> from the can (keeping the liquid) and cut 
  crosswise 
    into pieces about 1/2 inch long.</li>
  <li>Butter a 7 by 11 inch baking dish well. Layer in 1/3 of the 
    <b>Potatoes</b>, then spread half the <b>Onions</b> and dot with half 
    the <b>Sprat</b> pieces. Follow with another third of the potatoes, 
    and the rest of the Onions. Dot with the rest of the Sprats, then top 
    with the last third of the Potatoes.</li>
  <li>Pour about 1/2 the <b>Sprat liquid</b> around over the potatoes, then 
    dot the top with <b>Butter</b>. Finally pour in 1/2 the <b>Cream</b>.
    Note that some recipes call for bread crumbs over the top for more 
    browning, but I have very authentic recipes that do not.</li>
  <li>Slip into the oven and bake for about 45 minutes. Pull and pour the 
    rest of the cream over (being careful not to pour cold cream against 
    hot glass). Put back into the oven for another 20 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Red potatoes work well here, or White Rose. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sprats:</h3> &nbsp; That's a 3-1/2 ounce can of <u>Swedish</u> 
  sprats (not smoked Baltic sprats). Many recipes not in Swedish call 
  for "Anchovies". <b><u>This is wrong</u>!</b> <i>Ansjovis</i> in 
  Swedish means Sprats. Actual anchovies are called <i>sardeller</i>. 
  Swedish sprats are totally different from Baltic sprats. They are not 
  smoked and are packed in sugar, salt, vinegar and spices (particularly 
  cloves and cinnamon), and come about 20 fillets to a 3-1/2 ounce flat 
  can yielding 2 ounces drained. Abba brand are no longer sold by IKEA 
  and cost 2018 US $11 on-line (more than half for perishable shipping). 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_spratz.html"><b>Sprats</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Substitute #1:</h3> &nbsp; Matjes Herring pieces 
  in the same brine may be easier to find locally than the Sprats and 
  will work fine. Purchased on-line, they are similarly expensive to 
  the Sprats due to perishable shipping. </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Substitute #2:</h3> &nbsp; Lithuanian pickled Sprats and Herring 
  are easily availabe locally, at least here in Southern California. They 
  are very fine substitutes, especially those marked "Scandinavian Style", 
  but are always packed in light oil rather than brine. I suggest 
  draining them well and making a substitute for the brine used in the 
  recipe from 2 T Water, 1/2 t Wine Vinegar and 1/4 t each of Salt and 
  Sugar.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Herring Temptation:</h3> &nbsp; For this version, a salt 
  pickled Herring is used. See our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_herraz.html"><b>Atlantic Herring</b></a> page 
  for instructions on how to prepare this fish. Depending on how 
  thoroughly de-salted the fillets are, you may need a light sprinkle 
  of salt on the potato layers. I'd also go with the substitute brine 
  discussed in Note-4.</li>
