Swedish meatballs are an important item in Scandinavia. Small ones are 
served plain as appetizers and bigger ones with sauce, often as a main 
dish, perhaps over pasta. Here is a

There are dozens of recipes for Swedish meatballs because they're 
generally made from what's on hand. The traditional meat mix is beef and 
pork, but veal is also used and you can even use chicken thighs if you 
object to pork and/or veal.
<ol>
  <li>Put <b>BREAD CRUMBS</b> in a large mixing bowl and stir in 
    <b>Cream</b> and <b>Water</b>. Let stand for at least 5 minutes. 
    <u>This is a critical point</u> because if this mixture isn't pretty 
    stiff you'll end up with Swedish micro-burgers instead of meatballs. 
    Adjust as needed.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>MEATS</b> well if not already ground.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine and fry stirring in a little 
    <b>Butter</b> until just starting to color. Let cool.</li>
  <li>Stir all <b>Meat Mix items</b> into the Bread Crumbs and mix very 
    well and evenly.</li>
  <li>Dust a holding surface lightly with flour. Oil your hands liberally 
    with olive oil and form the <b>Mix</b> into balls. Toss them back and 
    forth between your hands, gently squeezing into shape between tosses. 
    If they start to stick rinse your hands, dry them on a paper towel, 
    take a swig of your beer, re-oil and continue. Balls should be 1-1/2 
    inches (no larger) for dinner size, 1 inch (no smaller than 3/4 inch) 
    for appetizer balls. Keep the balls as close to the same size as 
    possible for even cooking. See 
    <a href="vam_swedball1x.html#prod"><b>Production Photos</b></a>.
    </li>
  <li>In your 12 inch skillet melt <b>Butter</b>. <u>Temperature is 
    critical</u> - you need it high enough to brown the meatballs well 
    but never so hot as to see a wisp of smoke. The foam on the surface 
    should stay a very light brown.. Butter should be about 1/8 inch 
    deep for well formed balls. If your meatballs sag and are more like 
    micro-burgers, do not despair, but do increase the depth of the 
    butter / oil mix to about 1/4 inch to make sure the sides brown.</li>
  <li>Oil your hands again. Giving each meatball a final shaping, set it 
    gently into the pan. Do not crowd the pan, you need room to 
    manipulate the balls, but they shouldn't be too sparse either.
  <li>Once you've gotten them all in, start with the first ones and give 
    them 1/4 turn or so. When you've gotten them all, go back and give 
    them another 1/4 turn. I find a good set of tongs the best tool for 
    this part.</li>
  <li>Now that they've firmed up, start rolling them around with a wooden 
    spatula until they're done through and lightly browned all over. For 
    1-1/2 inch dinner balls this should be about 10 minutes, for 1 inch 
    appetizer balls about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain the browned meatballs on paper towels. At this point they 
    may be cooled for future use or kept warm for immediate use. For 
    future use spread on a baking sheet and reheat in a 
    350&deg;F/177&deg;C oven for 15 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir the meatballs into your chosen sauce until coated and serve 
    warm.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Note-1:</b> &nbsp; Some recipes call for roasting the meatballs 
    on a baking sheet in the oven at 450&deg;F/230&deg;C for 10 to 15 
    minutes. This is a lot easier if you're in a hurry, but frying is 
    reputed to produce superior meatballs.</p>
  <p><b>Note-2:</b> &nbsp; Another common seasoning is 1/4 t dry mustard 
    and 1/8 t ground nutmeg in place of the allspice.</p>

  This is a somewhat sweet sauce that goes over very well at parties, but 
  you might want to cut back on the jam if serving it for dinner.
  <ol>
  <li>Chill <b>Beef Stock</b> if it's hot.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and stir in <b>Flour</b>. Fry stirring until the 
    raw flour taste is gone and you have a blonde roux.</li>
  <li>Start slowly adding <b>Beef Stock</b> stirring constantly to 
    prevent lumps. Stop when you get to the sauce consistency you want - 
    a little thinner than you think it should be because it will stiffen 
    when used.</li>
  <li>Add the <b>Wine</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer for a 
    few minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Sour Cherry Jam</b> to the degree of sweetness you want, 
    mix well and simmer a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Cream</b> and turn off the heat.</li>

  tradition - that dishes named after a country are never actually
