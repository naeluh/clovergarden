While Americans tend to associate hash with breakfast, this dish can be 
served at any time of day. It can be served in various ways (see 
<a href="vbm_hash1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> and <a href="vbm_hash1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Dice <b>POTATOES</b> into 1/4 inch cubes. Keep them in cold water 
    until needed.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>BEEF</b> and <b>HAM</b> into 1/4 inch cubes. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine.</li>
  </ol>  
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr - with moderate attention)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and dry them as well as you can. I just run 
    them in the salad spinner, but spreading them out on paper towels 
    also works.</li>
  <li>In a spacious (12 inch is good) well seasoned skillet, melt 
    <b>Butter</b> and <b>Oil</b>. Fry <b>Potatoes</b> over very moderate 
    heat, turning frequently until golden brown and crispy, then remove 
    them from the pan.</li>
  <li>Add a little more butter and oil if needed (it probably will be), 
    then fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent but not at all browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Diced Meat</b> and fry turning often until there is some 
    light browning.</li>
  <li>Stir the <b>Potatoes</b> back in until warmed through, then stir in 
    <b>Parsley</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot on warmed plates, with an <b>Egg</b> for each serving 
    (see <a href="vbm_hash1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> and <a href="vbm_hash1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or Red Potatoes 
  work well here, or some other potato that holds together well. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; One egg per serving. The traditional way to serve 
  this hash in Sweden is with a raw egg yolk in the half shell (as shown 
  in the photo). This is dumped out and mixed with the hash at the table. 
  Unfortunately, many Americans distrust "undercooked" eggs, having 
  discovered the egg producers in their region are not farmers, but 
  "efficient American businessmen", who don't care if you die so long as 
  they can cut costs. Here in "over-regulated, business-unfriendly 
  California", we use a lot of "undercooked" eggs, but for you folks out 
  there in the Red States I suggest a well fried egg.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; For the photo (and my dinner) I served this 
  the "proper" way, as in the photo. For breakfast I used the rest of 
  the hash "American style". Heated it in the pan, pushed it out to the 
  edges and fried lightly salted scrambled eggs in the center, then 
  mixed it all. Pretty good that way too.</li>
