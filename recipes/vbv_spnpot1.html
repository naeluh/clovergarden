<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>SPINACH</b>. Remove heavy stems and discard. Tear really 
    big leaves into large pieces. Run dry in a Salad Spinner and seal in a 
    plastic bag. This will keep in the fridge for 2 days.</li>
   </ol>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
<ol start="2">
  <li>Cut skin-on <b>POTATOES</b> as needed. Tiny ones in half, very small 
    ones into quarters, and medium ones into small cubes. Hold in cold 
    water until needed.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>MUSHROOMS</b> into large pieces.</li> 
  <li>Cap <b>GREEN CHILI</b>. Remove as much of the core and veins you think 
    you need to, and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.
    </li>
  <li>Strip <b>THYME LEAVES</b> from stems.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Preheat Oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C. See also 
    <a href="vbv_spnpot1.html#05"><b>Options</b></a>.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan, place <b>Potatoes</b> with lightly salted water to cover, 
    Bring to a boil, turn to a simmer, cover, and simmer until potatoes are 
    just cooked through, (about 15 minutes).</li> 
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan (3-1/2 qt) or wok, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>.  
    Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, <b>Thyme Leaves</b>, and a generous sprinkle of 
    <b>Salt</b>. Fry over moderately high heat, stirring fairly often, until 
    potatoes are lightly browned (about 12 minutes)</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, steam <b>Spinach</b> until just done. drain well.</li>
  <li>When Potatoes are lightly browned, stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and 
    <b>Garlic mix</b>. Continue to fry stirring, over moderate heat, until 
    Mushrooms have given up most, but not all, of their liquid.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Spinach</b>. Place into 4 medium dishes, or one or two larger 
    dishes as desired. Make shallow impressions for as many <b>Eggs</b> as 
    you will use and break an <b>Egg</b> into each. Sprinkle with <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Slide Dishes into the Oven for just as long as is needed for the Whites 
    to set (10 minutes or so).</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Use White Potatoes. they can be tiny, very small, 
  or medium, depending on how you cut them. For Medium, White Rose will 
  work well. For details see our <a href="../ingred/potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, that's a lot of Spinach. She doesn't say so, 
  but I presume the pattern recipe expects stems to be discarded. I used a 
  lesser amount of Taiwan Spinach, from which you do not discard the stems.
  Actually, you can use stems from regular spinach too, if you give them a 
  few minutes head start in the steaming.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "Brown Mushrooms", 
  but I used regular "White Mushrooms". There isn't a lot of difference.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Green Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Type was not specified, and I have no idea 
  what Chilis they use in Denmark. I used a Serrano with just the main core 
  taken out and the veins left in, and that didn't make the finished dish 
  noticeably hot. Use your own best judgement here. For detail see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_mexiz.html"><b>Mexican Chilis</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Options:</h3> &nbsp; If you are skipping the Eggs, you don't need the 
  oven and can complete the dish in the pan. You could also make 
  <a href="gbd_eggpoach1.html"><b>Poached Eggs</b></a> and hold them in 
  warm water. You could also make fried eggs, Sunny Side Up.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe had the raw potato pieces 
  stir fried in the pan. This took too long and too much attention, and 
  didn't offer any improvement over the pre-cooked potatoes.</li>
