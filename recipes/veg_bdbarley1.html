Any "purist" worth his sneer would say "Not authentic, the Finns can't 
grow wheat". I'm pretty sure they've sold enough telecom equipment to 
buy an occasional bag of flour.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/2 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Mix <b>Buttermilk</b> with <b>Water</b> and warm it (but not too warm or 
    the buttermilk will separate). Mix in <b>Yeast</b>.</li>
  <li>Mix in <b>Salt</b>, then beat in <b>Bread Flour</b> and continue to 
    beat until it thickens.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and stir in. Then knead in just 2 cups of the 
    <b>Barley Flour</b>. Knead in, just a little at a time, more 
    <b>Barley Flour</b> until the dough is easy to handle. Knead well, 
    (about 20 minutes resting now and then (well, actually I use the bread 
    hook in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, and the dough has enough flour when 
    it rides up the hook and cleans the bowl)).</li>
  <li>Shape <b>Dough</b> into a ball, put it in a bowl in a warm place, cover 
    loosely and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Divide <b>Dough</b> into two loaves and set them on a lightly oiled 
    baking sheet sprinkled with pumpernickel or some other meal. With a wet 
    knife cut three shallow diagonal slits in the top of each one. 
    Cover and let rise until about doubled.</li>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes at 425&deg;F/220&deg;C, then cool on a 
    rack.</li>
  <li>This easy to make bread is fairly moist and tender, and will keep 
  several days loosely bagged in plastic.</li>
