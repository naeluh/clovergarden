Essential to Finnish cuisine, this bread is substantial, flavorful, chewy, 
and goes exceedingly well with butter. It is not, however, the easiest bread 
to make - rye flour is sticky and rather badly behaved.

<p>I cannot claim to have fully mastered this bread, but my loaves 
(probably halfway between eastern and western style) are quite edible. 
See <a href="veg_bdsrye1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> and <a href="veg_bdsrye1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> 
for details.</p>
  <p><b>IF</b> this is your first batch, you will have to follow these 
  instructions and times. If you have kept sour starter from a previous 
  batch you can significantly cut the time for the first step.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>In a bowl mix <b>2 c Rye Flour</b> into <b>4 c Water</b> to make a 
    thin slurry. If you have some <b>Starter</b> add it here. Sprinkle a 
    little <b>Rye Flour</b> over it and leave the bowl uncovered in a 
    warm place for at least 24 hours. If you used starter you can cover 
    the bowl loosely and let it sit for 12 hours or so. Note: the "warm 
    place" should not exceed 80&deg;F / 27&deg;C or you risk the wrong 
    culture and bitter starter. See <a href="veg_bdsrye1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.</li>
  <li>The second day stir in <b>2 c</b> more <b>Rye Flour</b>, cover very 
    loosely and set aside for another 24 hours. <b>Warning:</b> &nbsp; 
    soon after mixing the slurry will bubble strongly and may overflow 
    your bowl if you don't watch it. By the end of the second day the 
    slurry should be quite sour, which is when you should scoop out a 
    quarter cup or so for future starter (see <a href="veg_bdsrye1.html#05">
    <b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Knead in the <b>Bread Flour</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Then start 
    kneading in the rest of the <b>Rye Flour</b>, but don't exceed the 7 
    cups called for. If you think the dough really needs more flour, add 
    a bit more bread flour. Knead well for about 30 minutes. See 
    <a href="veg_bdsrye1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for the gory details.</li>
  <li>With wet hands shape the <b>Dough</b> into a ball, put it in a 
    large bowl, cover very loosely and set in a warm place (80&deg;F to 
    85&deg;F - about 28&deg;C) and let rise until doubled in volume, 
    about 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Grease your baking sheet well and sprinkle it with pumpernickel 
    meal or some other meal - or you'll need a hammer and chisel to get 
    the finished bread off it.</li>
  <li>With wet hands divide the dough into two equal parts and form two 
    round loaves on the baking sheet. Let rise until about doubled in 
    volume.</li>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 425&deg;F/220&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Bake for 40 to 60 minutes (depending on thickness) at 
    425&deg;F/220&deg;C, Pull it when it is getting nicely browned on the 
    top and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
  <li>Set out on a cooling rack to cool, covered with a thick towel or 
    foil so the crust softens.</li>
  <li>When completely cooled, loaves can be loosely bagged in plastic and 
    will keep for a few days.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Traditional Practice:</h3> &nbsp; In eastern 
  Finland this bread is made into fairly thick loaves and baked about 
  twice a week. In western Finland it is traditionally made into thin 
  loaves the shape of millstones (with a hole in the center). In the west 
  it is baked twice a year and strung up on poles until hard, then stored 
  in a special room. The eastern Finns think the millstone shape is quite 
  appropriate for this hard dry bread. This bread is traditionally made 
  up in a large stone bowl. The bowl is not washed and bits of dough 
  dried to the sides act as starter for the next batch.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Bread with a high rye content must 
  be made from a distinctly sour dough or it will not rise properly. Rye 
  dough is very sticky and difficult to handle. When shaping balls and 
  loaves your hands must be wet, even oiling them does no good.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rye Flour:</h3> &nbsp; This must be dark rye flour, 
  which you'll probably have to order from a mill (I get mine from Bobs 
  Red Mill). Light rye flour is for central European breads that are 
  mostly wheat flour.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Kneading:</h3> &nbsp;  I use the bread hook in my 
  Kitchen Aid stand mixer, but this dough is so sticky it will never 
  ride up the hook and clean the bowl as most doughs do. In fact, by the 
  point where I think it has enough flour I have to strap the bowl down to 
  the lift arms to keep it from being yanked off its pins and flung across 
  the kitchen.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Starter:</h3> &nbsp; Sourdough "purists" sneer 
  at the use of commercial yeast, insisting on wild yeast, claiming it 
  produces a starter with more character. It also can take days longer 
  and involves greater risk of a bad batch. Starter is a living colony 
  of yeasts and bacteria. Kept in the fridge (leave the lid a bit loose) 
  it needs to be fed every couple  of weeks. Use it and replace as in 
  the recipe above or throw some out and replace it with 50% flour, 
  50% water. A dark liquid called "hooch" may form on the top - just 
  stir it back in.</li>
