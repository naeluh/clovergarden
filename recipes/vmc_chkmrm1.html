<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless, 
  preferably thigh/leg meat for better texture and flavor. The pattern 
  recipe called for a whole 4 pound chicken cut up into serving pieces. 
  I find skinless, boneless easier to cook and much better for buffet 
  service. It can also be more equitably divided at the family table. 
  Skin-on, bone in, may provide more flavor, but I recover that flavor 
  from a strong stock, which includes the skins and bones (see 
  <a href="vmc_chkmrm1.html#03">Note-</a>).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I recommend the small King Trumpet Oyster 
  Mushrooms now common, at least here in Southern California. They are 
  very tasty cooked (no so much raw). Regular White Mushrooms can also 
  be used, but the flavor will be different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; For recipes like this that require stock, I 
  buy the chicken a day ahead, thighs or leg quarters depending on how 
  much stock I want to make. I cut off the meat for the recipe and make 
  the stock with all the bones, fat and off cuts. If making the stock 
  days ahead I freeze the meat. For details on making and storing stock, 
  see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; To serve with this stew, prepare any kind 
  of Potatoes you like any way you like them.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The Onions were not included in the pattern 
  recipe, but I was pretty sure they were needed. The pattern recipe 
  used a broiler chicken cut into serving pieces, but boneless meat is 
  much more practical for buffet service, and if you need to minimize 
  family fights over who gets what pieces. </li>
