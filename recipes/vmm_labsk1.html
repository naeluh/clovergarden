Of Latvian / Lithuanian origin (see <a href="vmm_labsk1.html#06"><b>History</b></a>),
this stew was adopted in all the northern seaport countries. This recipe 
is for Brun Lapskaus - Light Lapskaus is made with Pork.

<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
The Norwegian 
version is very popular in the American Midwest. With the addition of 
diced bacon Labskovs becomes <i>Skipper Labskovs</i>. For more on the 
Danish version, see <a href="vmm_labsk1.html#07"><b>Comments</b></a>. For Liverpool 
version see <a href="bmm_scouse1.html"><b>Scouse</b></a>.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into pieces about 1-1/4 
  inch on a side.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into quarters lengthwise and slice crosswise about 
  1/4 inch wide.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes about 3/4 inch or a little 
  less. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>PARSNIPS</b> (IF used). Cut into pieces 
  1/2 to 1 inch long depending on size. Split large end of Parsnip 
  into quarters before slicing.</li>
<li>Prepare <b>LEEK</b> (IF used) and slice thin (white and light green 
  only). Mix with Carrots.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> coarse for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 to 4-1/4 hrs depending on beef cut)
<ol start="7">
<li>Select a large heavy bottomed Dutch oven or similar - I use a 5-1/2 
  quart multi-ply saut&eacute; pan, which is sufficient for up to 1-1/2 
  recipes. Heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until 
  the Beef is lightly browned on all sides - not too dark, or it will 
  harden.</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Onions</b>. Fry, stirring often, until translucent.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Bring to 
  a boil, cover and turn to a simmer until meat is nearly tender. This 
  can be as little as 1 hour for Chuck, as much as 2-3/4 hours for Shank.
  </li>
<li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in along with <b>Carrot mix</b>. 
  Bring back to a boil, cover and turn to a simmer for 30 minutes or 
  until meat and carrots are tender.</li>
<li>Adjust liquid as needed, by adding boiling water or simmering with 
  the lid off.</li>
<li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley</b> and with <b>Pickled 
  Beets</b> on the side, In Norway it is usually served with plenty of 
  liquid, but in Denmark it varies from lots of liquid all the way to 
  no liquid. I prefer it with plenty of liquid.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing all bones and excess 
  fat. Chuck is good, but tougher stewing cuts can be used with a little 
  more cooking. Shank is excellent, but needs more preparation and 
  longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose potatoes 
  which hold up well, but not too well, in stews. Avoid "Yukon Gold" 
  type potatoes which disintegrate into mush if cooked just a little 
  long, and have a different flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Carrots, Parsnip:</h3> &nbsp; I have not seen use of either of 
  these in Danish recipes, nor Leeks either. For Danish just use more 
  Potatoes if you want "authentic". In Norway Parsnips may be replaced 
  by Celery Root, Rutabaga, Parsley Root, or a combination.</li>  
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; When preparing to do a recipe of this sort, I 
  buy the Beef a day ahead, large chunks with bones. I trim the meat 
  as needed, and make plenty of stock with the bones and offcuts. If 
  I do this far ahead, I freeze the meat until needed. For details of 
  making and storing stock, see our recipe 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth - General 
  Method</b></a>.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pickled Beets:</h3> &nbsp; It would be considered a mortal sin to 
  serve these stews without Pickled Beets. See our recipe
  <a href="vpv_beetpkl2.html"><b>Pickled Beets</b></a>.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; This stew is of East Baltic origin 
  (Latvian <i>Labs kausis</i>; Lithuanian <i>Labas kausas</i>) both 
  meaning "Good Ladle" or "Good Bowl". It was adopted in many other 
  northern seaports: Liverpool <a href="bmm_scouse1.html">
  <i>Scouse</i></a>, Wales <i>Lobsgows</i>, Norwegian <i>Lapskaus</i>, 
  Danish <i>Labskovs</i>. In some countries it has evolved into mashes 
  made from similar ingredients: German <i>Labskaus</i>, 
  Swedish <i>Lapskojs</i> and Finnish <i>Lapskoussi</i> All refer back 
  to a sailor's stew of salted meat and root vegetables, originally 
  thickened with sea biscuits. In early times the beef was not browned, 
  as the kitchens were not equipped for that, but nearly all modern 
  recipes call for browning for extra flavor.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Photos and recipes I've seen of Danish 
  Labskovs do not include carrots, parsnips, or rutabaga, but may 
  include a whole lot more potatoes. Some Danish recipes call for 
  Russet Potatoes, with a result more similar to the mashes of Germany 
  and Sweden than to the stews of Norway and the British Isles. 
  Personally, I prefer these stews with carrots as in Norway, England 
  and Wales. In Norway and Denmark, the meat is traditionally fried in 
  Butter, cooking oils having been scarce in the region until modern 
  times. I use Olive Oil, which is more practical because keeping the 
  temperature low is not so critical - I've got other stuff to watch.
