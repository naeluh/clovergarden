A very popular dinner in Norway and Sweden, and an excellent party 
dish. It's quite easy to make and makes a fine presentation, but the 
cooking time is fairly critical.

  <b><u>Make</u>:</b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (stuff &amp; bind 20 min, brown 
    40 min, roast 1 hr 20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Prunes</b> and <b>Apricots</b> in a saucepan with water to 
     cover. Bring it to a boil, turn off the heat and let stand for 1/2 
     hour.</li>
  <li>Peel and core <b>Apple</b>. Cut it into chunks about 1 inch on a side 
     and tumble it with a little lemon juice to prevent browning.</li>
  <li>Pierce the <b>Pork Loin</b> all they way through lengthwise. and 
     expand the opening sufficient for stuffing. I first pierce it with 
     a sharp cooking chopstick long enough to go all the way through. Then 
     I run through with the handle of my egg spoon, also long enough to go 
     the whole way. Finally I force a tapered wooden pestle, 1-1/4 inch 
     diameter, all the way through.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Fruit</b> and stuff the cavity, forcing in as much as you 
     can, alternating prune, apricot and apple. close the ends with a chunk 
     of apple.</li>
  <li>Bind the stuffed <b>Pork Loin</b> into a nice cylinder (see 
     <a href="vmm_pigprune1x.html#bind"><b>Photo</b></a>). I tuck a 
     thin slice of apple with the skin still on under the string that 
     crosses the ends to help hold the stuffing in.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b> in a Dutch Oven just sufficient to 
     hold the loin. If you have an oval one, all the better, Fry over fairly 
     moderate heat turning often until nicely browned on all sides. I try to 
     keep the oil between 270&deg;F and 300&deg;F (using an infrared surface 
     temperature thermometer), but in any case, slow is better. I brown 
     with the flame under one end first, then the other end and the middle 
     takes care of itself.</li>
  <li>Remove all the <b>Oil</b> from the Dutch Oven. Turn the roast fatty 
     side up. Pour in the <b>Wine</b> and <b>Water</b>. Cover tightly and 
     put in the oven (if your lid isn't tight enough put a sheet of aluminum 
     foil between the pot and lid). <b>Caution:</b>, do not let the internal 
     temperature of the thickest part exceed 165&deg;F or you will have  a 
     very dry roast. At around 1 hour start monitoring the internal 
     temperature frequently. When it hits about 164&deg;F pull it out of 
     the oven (temperature at the center will continue to rise to about 
     170&deg;F. Let cool covered, then lift the roast out of the Dutch 
     oven. Keep the broth, it makes a great sauce for the roast.</li>
  <li>For buffet service, I slice it and keep it in a warming pan with 
     the cooking broth so it doesn't become dry.</li>
