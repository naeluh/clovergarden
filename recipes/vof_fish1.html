A typical Swedish fish soup, suitable as an elegant soup course. It can 
easily be made more substantial with some diced potatoes. This soup can 
be made ahead and reheats well.

  <ol>
  <li>Scale and clean <b>FISH</b>. Fillet it. Split the heads and put them 
    in your soup pot along with the bones and fins. Include the skins only 
    if they are known not to have a strong flavor 
    (see <a href="vof_fish1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li> Cut the <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>CELERY</b> into small pieces. Add 
    <b>All Stock items</b> to the pot with the fish bones.</li>
  <li>Bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 45 minutes. Strain and 
    discard all solids.</li>
  <li>De-fat the stock using your gravy separator.</li>
  <li>Cut the <b>Fillets</b> into small pieces. For very firm fish they 
    should be quite small, larger for fish that flakes apart when cooked.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Fish</b> to the stock and simmer long enough to get the 
    consistency your want.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> in a small saucepan and stir in <b>Flour</b> 
    until it is well cooked but not at all browned. Stir in the <b>Milk</b> 
    little by little until you have a smooth sauce, then stir in some of 
    the fish stock, and finally stir the mixture back into the pot. Simmer 
    for a few minutes more.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot. On special occasions <b>Cream</b> and <b>Egg Yolks</b> are 
    beaten together, then the soup is poured over them before being serving.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01"><b>Fish:</b> &nbsp; Weight is for whole fish with 
  heads, guts and feathers. Use a fish that breaks into largish flakes 
  but is not too firm and makes a good soup stock. The original recipe 
  called for Haddock, but we don't have Haddock here in Southern 
  California. The photo specimen was made with Red Drum (Redfish) which 
  does not flake so needed to be cut into very small pieces. For details 
  see our   <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Fish Pages</b></a> (very large 
  page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The original recipe cleaned the 
  fish, then just cut it up and simmered it with the vegetables, then 
  picked the flesh off the bones. I don't do it that way, but you can if 
  you wish.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Time:</h3> &nbsp; How long this soup takes 
  depends on how quick you are at scaling, gutting and filleting fish. 
  Starting with whole fish, I might have finished soup in about 2 hours. 
  Of course, if I have fish stock from a previous project and some fish 
  fillets on hand, it will take about an hour and a quarter.</li>
