This soup is elegant, rich, and satisfyingly flavorful, but it's a soup 
course soup, not a main dish soup. It could be extended some with 1/4 
inch dice of cooked potato and some short segments of cooked asparagus 
- but in limited amount.

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr for Veg, 4 hrs for Chicken 
    - 15 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Stock</b> if you don't have it on hand (see 
    <a href="vov_aspar1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Break tough ends form <b>ASPARAGUS</b>. If very large, peel the 
    bottom third or so. Reserve all offcuts and peels.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Asparagus</b> into about 1 inch lengths.</li>
  <li>In a saucepan, heat the <b>STOCK</b>. Stir in the tough ends and 
    any peelings. Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes or so. Strain 
    and discard the solids.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min) 
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saucepan large enough for the whole recipe, melt the 
    <b>Butter</b> over moderate heat and fry the <b>Onion</b> until 
    translucent, with no browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in chopped <b>Asparagus</b>. Cover and sweat over low  
    heat for about 10 minutes, stirring  now and then.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle in 1 T <b>Flour</b> and fry stirring until cooked, but 
    not at all browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b>, a little at first, increasing a bit with 
    each addition until it is all in. Stir well with every addition.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>White Wine</b>, <b>Whipping Cream</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Hold over low heat at a bare simmer, partially covered, 
    for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let the Soup cool a little, then run in a Blender until smooth.</li>
  <li>Clean the pan and return the soup to it. Bring up just to a bare 
    simmer. Adjust seasoning if needed. Stir in Lemon Juice and take off 
    the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with droplets of <b>Heavy Cream</b> and a 
    grind of fresh <b>Black Pepper</b>. <u>Note</u>: the droplets of Cream 
    will mostly sink, but don't overdo it. They will soon rise to the 
    surface and spread out.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asparagus:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is for Green Asparagus, which 
  has recently eclipsed White Asparagus in Sweden. White Asparagus, 
  greatly lacking in flavor, needs a different recipe. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/li_aspara.html"><b>Asparagus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Chicken or Vegetable stock can be used. For 
  details see our recipe  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / 
  Broth</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is especially good when the 
  affordable asparagus is of very uneven sizes. The pattern recipe called 
  for reserving some of the best spears for garnish. This doesn't 
  actually work, they sink like rocks. I re-examined the photo and saw 
  that it was faked up. He put the soup in a shallow dish, placed one 
  spear that pretty much sank, but placed another across it which was 
  supported above the surface by the first one.</li>
