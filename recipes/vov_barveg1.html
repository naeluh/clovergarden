A cleansing soup, often made to recover from the indulgences of 
December. It is made throughout Scandinavia, and I composed this recipe 
in reference to a half dozen similar recipes from Denmark Sweden and 
Norway.

<p>For non-vegetarian, you can add any meats you have left over. See 
<a href="vov_barveg1.html#08"><b>Note-8</b></a> on making ahead and buffet service.</p>

  <b><u>Do-Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr veg, 4-1/2 hrs chicken, 8-1/2 hours beef)
  <ol>
  <li>Make the kind of <b>Soup Stock</b> you want to use. For details 
    on making and storing stock, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html">
    <b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> page.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (45)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice fairly thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into pieces 
    appropriate to their type and size (about 3/4 inch in general).</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>LEEK</b> and slice fairly thin, white and light green 
    parts only. Mix with Mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch dice. Hold in 
    cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>PARSNIPS</b> about 1/4 inch at the big 
    end, longer as you get to the thin end. If very large, cut the big end 
    in half lengthwise, or quarters for Parsnips. Mix.</li> 
  <li>Peel <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and <b>RUTABAGA</b>. cut into about 1/2 
    inch dice. Mix with Carrots</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SPINACH</b> (If Used) coarse. Reserve some for Garnish.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for Garnish (IF not using Spinach).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hrs depending on Barley)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a heavy bottomed pot of at least 5 quarts, melt <b>Butter</b> 
    and fry <b>Onions</b> until just translucent. Stir in 
    <b>Mushrooms</b> and <b>Leeks</b>. Fry stirring until mushrooms are 
    cooked through and start giving up their moisture. No browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Barley</b>, <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Bay Leaves</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Stock</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, 
    stirring now and then, until the Barley is nearly tender. This can 
    be as little as 45 minutes for heavily pearled Barley, or 1-1/4 
    hours for the lightly pearled Barley I use.</li> 
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> and stir in along with the other 
    <b>Root Vegies</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer until the 
    Carrots and Potatoes are tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Nutmeg</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid. You probably want somewhat more than in the photo 
    above.</li>
  <li>If using <b>Spinach</b>, stir it in just before taking the soup
    off the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot (or even "Brennsnut" hot), garnished with <b>Parsley</b> or 
    <b>Spinach</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; I use a relatively lightly pearled barley 
  (it still has a shade of color) as it maintains a better texture 
  and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot nearly as badly as heavily 
  pearled barley. It does take longer to cook.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I recommend the small King Trumpet Oyster 
  Mushrooms now common, at least here in Southern California. They are 
  very tasty cooked (no so much raw). Regular White Mushrooms can also 
  be used, but the flavor will be different. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a>
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Root Vegetables</h3> &nbsp; Though Potatoes are just about always 
  used, the other root vegetables are very flexible (though I always 
  include Carrots). Others that can be use are Turnips (white), Kohlrabi, 
  and Parsley Roots. Whatever combination, the total weight should be 
  the same.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes of 
  this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; [Celeriac] Nordic people traditionally 
  have only root vegetables available in winter. While Celery Root is 
  quite common all year here in Southern California produce markets, 
  it may be hard to find elsewhere. You can slice 2 celery sticks and 
  add them with the Onions for flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Use Vegetable stock for vegetarian, but, if you 
  don't care about that, Chicken Stock or Beef Stock will also work fine. 
  For details on making and storing stock, see our 
  <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a> page. If 
  making Vegetable Stock, I'll often prepare the Leeks and Root 
  Vegetables earlier in the day and use the peels and offcuts as part 
  of the stock ingredients.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Spinach:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes call for this, and, being a 
  cold climate plant, it is often used in Scandinavia. If you use 
  Spinach, you can use some of it for garnish instead of Parsley. Baby 
  Spinach is for wimps and yuppies.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Make Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; Barley will keep absorbing  water for 
  quite some time. When doing ahead, cook until barley is just tender 
  enough. Cool, and refrigerate until needed. When used, bring it back 
  to a simmer, adding water or stock as needed. Stir often to prevent
  the barley from burning to the bottom of the pan, and make sure there 
  is enough liquid. For buffet service, use a bit more Garnish and just 
  stir it into the soup right before pouring it into a slow cooker. 
  Set cooker to "keep warm" and place it on the buffet.</li>
