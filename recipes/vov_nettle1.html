A light soup with delightful herbal flavor popular in Sweden, often 
served with a hard boiled or poached egg. It is a simple soup, so the quality 
of the beef stock is important, but it shouldn't be too strong.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)

  <li>Float wash <b>NETTLES</b> like you would spinach. Wear rubber gloves 
    if your skin is tender. Discard tough stems (those turning dark), drain 
    well and chop coarse.</li>

  <li>Put <b>Nettles</b> and <b>Stock</b> in a large saucepan. Bring to a 
    boil and simmer until nettles are tender, about 7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain soup into a bowl. Mix <b>Chive mix</b> with <b>Nettles</b> and 
    process very fine. I use a mini-prep food processor.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Nettles</b> and <b>Stock</b> to the saucepan. Bring back to 
    a simmer.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> in a sauce pan and fry <b>Flour</b> gently, stirring  
    until cooked but not at all browned. Take off heat and stir in just a 
    little of the soup until you have a smooth paste, then keep stirring 
    in more until you can pour it all back into the main pot.</li>
  <li>Bring up hot and serve with a hard cooked or poached egg.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>

<li id="01">
  <h3>Nettles:</h3> &nbsp; These should be tender tops of 
  young nettles. If you live in a region with humidity and streams you may 
  be able to cut them yourself (wear gloves - they sting). Here in 
  Southern California they can sometimes be obtained from herb growers 
  at local Farmer's Markets. Incidentally, they are much more likely to 
  sting when you brush against them lightly than when you handle 
  them firmly. For details see our <a href="../ingred/od_nettlz.html">
  <b>Nettles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chervil:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is almost never available here in 
  Southern California. I use either brine packed chervil from a jar 
  (available in markets serving an Armenian community) or innermost 
  (yellow) stem of celery along with just a touch of fresh tarragon. 
  Chefs love to call for this herb to make you feel inferior, because 
  it is impossible to get in most of North of America. It is common 
  in France.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; I have made this soup ahead, 
  cooled it and refrigerated it in a sealed container, finding the color 
  was still attractive the following afternoon.</li>
