These popular everyday pickled beets are served with all sorts of meats,  
fish, and stews, and as toppings for Sm&oslash;rrebr&oslash;d - especially 
good with liver pastes and the like.

<p>These Beets are best if you close the jar and let them mature a couple 
of days in a cool place, but they can be served in a couple of hours if 
need be.</p>
  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 days - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Boil <b>BEETS</b> just until done through. Determine this by running 
    a sharp skewer through the center of the largest one - it should not 
    encounter a hard spot. Cool the beets enough to handle, rub off the 
    skins and cut out any grungy parts.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beets</b> about 1/4 inch thick and cut slices into quarters 
    (or whatever shape you like).</li>
  <li>Pack <b>Beet slices</b> into a sterile jar (not too tight).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>HORSERADISH</b> thin and put slices on top of the Beets 
    in the Jars.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Pickle items</b> in a pot and bring to a boil. Simmer 
    for about 10 minutes, then strain into the jar of <b>Beets</b>.</li>
  <li>Close the jar and let sit in a cool place for a couple of days, 
    if you can wait that long.</li>
  <li>Refrigerated, these will last for 6 months or so.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Horseradish Root:</h3> &nbsp; Horseradish strongly inhibits 
  bacteria, fungus and mold, which is the purpose of horseradish slices 
  on pickles. Whole root can be difficult to find here in Southern 
  California, bu I get roots from Jon's Market in Glendale, CA, which 
  serves a Russians community. It also adds flavor, and I have used a 
  Tablespoon or two of Morehouse Prepared Horseradish per jar of pickles 
  - but don't use a "cream style" Horseradish with dairy products in it.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe, and some others, calls 
  for Cider Vinegar, which is what I use, but many recipes just call 
  for "vinegar", so use what you like.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Scandinavians are <u>way</u> more into sugar 
  than I am, so I have cut the amount in half. Use an amount to your own 
  taste.</li>
