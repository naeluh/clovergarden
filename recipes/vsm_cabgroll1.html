<p>Traditionally these were made with barley and molasses, as I do here, 
but today most recipes call for imported rice and corn syrup.</p>

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hr - 1 hr work)
  <br>See the <a href="vsm_cabgroll1x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> 
  for pictorial instructions.
<ol>
<li>Cook <b>BARLEY</b>, preferably in broth for flavor. To get 1-1/3 cup 
  you need to start with a little over 1/2 cup. Be careful in the later 
  stages as barley burns to the bottom of the pan very easily.</li>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGES</b>. It is very important to remove the core 
  completely so boiling water can get at the stem ends of the leaves, 
  and for ease of stripping off the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot tall enough to completely 
  submerge a Cabbage. Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Lower 
  one of the <b>Cabbages</b> in (Carefully - see <a href="vsm_cabgroll1.html#03">
  <b>Note-3</b></a>) and hold it down with a wooden spoon in the core 
  hole for about 5  minutes. Swish it around a bit, and when the outer 
  two leaves start to drift away, it's ready. With the burner still on 
  high, hold the  Cabbage steady with the wooden spoon. Take tongs and 
  start peeling away the outermost leaves. Hold each by the stem, gently 
  shaking it loose and lifting it out. Peel until the leaves are getting 
  too small to stuff. Lift out the remaining cabbage and set it aside. 
  Now do the other Cabbage. Keep the small and torn leaves and some of 
  the water for cooking.</li>
<li>Place each softened cabbage leaf outside up on your cutting board and 
  shave the thick central rib thinner to make the leaf more flexible (see 
  <a href="vsm_cabgroll1x.html#gal">Photo Gallery</a>).</li>
<li>Take some of the damaged <b>Outer Leaves</b> or leaves too small to 
  stuff, squeeze dry and chop fine to make about 1/2 cup to add to the 
  stuffing.</li>
<li>Grind <b>Beef</b>. Mix together with the <b>Chopped Cabbage</b> 
  and all <b>Stuffing items</b></li> 
<li>Place each leaf inside up, and place a gob of stuffing (be generous, 
  this isn't hors d'oeuvres) near the stem end. Give it one turn, Fold 
  the sides in and roll up. Keep chilled until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F/175&deg;C.</li>
<li>Melt <b>Butter</b> and mix with <b>Molasses</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
<li>Select a baking dish or casserole the rolls will fit into fairly 
  snuggly, but not jammed. Line the bottom of the dish with some of the 
  small or torn cabbage leaves. Arrange rolls, then pour in about 1/3 cup 
  of the <b>Cabbage Water</b> around the rolls. Brush the tops of the 
  rolls evenly with the <b>Coating Mixture</b>.</li>
<li>Slide the baking dish into the preheated oven and bake at 
  350&deg;F/175&deg;C for about 1-3/4 hours. When the tops of the rolls 
  have browned nicely, baste occasionally with juice from the dish (a bulb 
  baster works well here). Add boiling water if necessary to keep the dish 
  from drying out.</li>
<li>These rolls take reheating reasonably well.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for one 
  large cabbage but I prefer two medium (about 2-1/2 pounds each) so the 
  leaves are more even in size. Two 2-1/2 pound cabbages will yield abut 
  24 leaves of suitable size.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; Use white pearled barley for 
  this recipe rather than hulled (brown). The flavor is better with the 
  cabbage, and more importantly, it makes the filling less crumbly.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Danger!</h3> &nbsp; You've got a big pot of 
  boiling water and you're dealing with a big, heavy, misbehaving lump of 
  cabbage. Most methods ask you to remove the cabbage to peel the leaves. 
  This is dangerous as the cabbage is very heavy coming out, and any slip 
  results in a tsunami of scalding hot water. My method, described 
  in the instructions, is far safer, as the cabbage is tiny by time it 
  is taken out. It is also quicker and produces the best quality, 
  evenly cooked leaves. Back when I followed other people's instructions, 
  I used a strong skimmer purchased from a restaurant supply (see 
  <a href="vsm_cabgroll1x.html#gal">Photo Gallery</a>) to lower the 
  Cabbage in and lift it out, steadied with a wooden spoon.</li>
