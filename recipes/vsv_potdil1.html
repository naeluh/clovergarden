Properly, these are made with "New Potatoes", which are potatoes so young 
and freshly dug the skins are like flaking paper - but these can rarely 
be had around here (see <a href="vsv_potdil1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).

  <li>Put <b>POTATOES</b> in a pot with water to cover. Add a bunch of 
    <b>Dill</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil just as long as needed 
    to cook through (use a sharp skewer to test for this point).</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you have real new potatoes, drain and server immediately 
    with just a sprinkle of salt.</li>
  <li><b>IF</b> you have other potatoes, you may wish, after they are 
    boiled, to fry them briefly in some butter for more flavor. Serve hot 
    with some chopped dill and a sprinkle of salt. Actually these can 
    also be used just a bit warm, depending on your needs.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes</h3> &nbsp; Real "New Potatoes" are not much available 
  in North America these days. Other very small potatoes can be used 
  with some changes in preparation.  Tiny red potatoes, often falsely 
  called "new potatoes", are the second best. The photo example was made 
  with white fingerling potatoes. The skins on these are a bit tougher 
  than reds, but they are edible and were well liked.</li>
