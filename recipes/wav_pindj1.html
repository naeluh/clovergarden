This condiment or spread, especially popular in Macedonia and Serbia, is 
similar to Ajvar, but Ajvar never includes eggplant. The name "Pindjur" 
is used in some regions for both Pindjur and Ajvar.

<p>Pindjur is usually made in much larger quantity than this recipe, 
and exact proportions of the ingredients vary quite a bit (see 
<a href="wav_pindj1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs) 
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C (if used (see 
    <a href="wav_pindj1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>)).</li>
  <li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>. Brush off the skins under running water. 
    Cap and seed them. Chop them fairly small.</li>
  <li>If using the oven: roast <b>EGGPLANTS</b> in the fully preheated 
    oven for around 30 minutes. It should look shriveled.</li>
  <li>Peel skins from <b>Eggplants</b> (by hand if from the oven, with 
    a vegetable peeler if raw. Chop small to medium.</li> 
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small to medium. Alternatively, you can blast 
    them black with the propane torch, this works fine too (it doesn't 
    work well on eggplant).</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs) 
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or sauce pan place <b>All 
    Ingredients</b> <u>except Oil</u>. Bring to a simmer stirring 
    now and then.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Oil</b> one tablespoon at a time while stirring. Simmer 
    covered 1-1/4 hour, or to get the texture you want.</li>
  <li>Uncover and simmer until you have the desired consistency.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes call for various peppers, including 
  red Paprika and Green Hungarian, but most often just "red peppers" 
  without more definition. They usually include some hot red chilis as 
  well. Paprika peppers aren't much available here in Southern 
  California, so I used Red Anaheims, which are plentiful. Seeded, they 
  have just the amount of hotness I usually want, so I do not add hot 
  chilis. If all you can get are red bell peppers, you will have to 
  include some hot chilis, as this condiment should not be completely 
  without heat. If you find it isn't hot enough, you can always hot it 
  up with some chili powder (I use Indian Reshampatti which I always 
  have on hand). For details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">
  <b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; One recipe I have from a Macedonian source 
  calls for "Tomatoes (unripe)", but doesn't give a hint as to how 
  unripe. It is one of the few recipes that doesn't include vinegar. 
  so it probably means fairly green so they are sour. Other recipes do 
  not specify the degree of ripeness, so I presume quite ripe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Not all recipes include vinegar, but the 
  majority do (see <a href="wav_pindj1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes vary widely as to the amount of oil. My 
  amount is at the low end. Most commonly used in the region is 
  Sunflower Seed oil, which is low cost, but some recipes call for 
  Olive Oil. I don't usually have Sunflower Seed oil on hand because 
  it goes rancid so quickly, so I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3>&nbsp; Most recipes call for the Eggplants, Peppers 
  and Tomatoes to be roasted in the oven, then peeled. Except for the 
  Eggplants this makes peeling much more difficult than need be, since 
  everything will be well cooked anyway. I could have peeled the 
  eggplant with a vegetable peeler, but chose to roast it in the oven 
  because it was of rather irregular shape (it was the only one left in 
  my local market Sunday afternoon).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; While the ingredients are usually pretty 
  much the same, the proportions tend to vary widely. The referenced 
  1989 cookbook, using the Serbian spelling and attributing it to 
  "Yugoslavia" (which didn't disintegrate until 1991), has equal 
  quantities of Eggplant, Peppers and Tomatoes, but none of the current 
  Internet recipes do. How fine the vegetables are chopped also varies 
  from fine to chunky, but it is <u>never food processor fine</u>.</li>
