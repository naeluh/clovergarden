Stuffed peppers (and other stuffed things) are very popular in the 
Balkans. These small appetizers are easy to make, if you know how to 
stuff them (see below).

<p>They are best served cool, but not chilled. See notes for method.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 45 min work) 
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat Oven to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your propane torch. Brush off 
    the skins under running water. Cap and seed them.</li>
  <li>Roast <b>EGGPLANTS</b> in the fully preheated oven for 45 minutes. 
    Test doneness with a thin skewer.</li>
  <li>Peel skins from <b>Eggplants</b>. Chop fine, but <u>not food 
    processor fine</u>. Squeeze out as much liquid as you can.</li> 
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Chop <b>ONION</b> very 
    fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix together <b>Eggplant</b> and <b>Garlic mix</b>. Next, mix in 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> until well blended. Finally, mix in <b>Salt</b> 
    and <b>Vinegar</b>.</li>
  <li>Stuff <b>Peppers</b>. Do this the easy way, with a pastry bag 
    using a medium round nozzle. Stick the nozzle all the way into the 
    pepper, then withdraw it as you squeeze in the stuffing.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate the stuffed <b>Peppers</b> until cool.</li>
  <li>For Garnish, chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Cut <b>TOMATO</b> wedges.
    </li>
  <li>Arrange <b>Stuffed Peppers</b> on a plate for serving, garnished 
    as desired. Let them warm up a few minutes until just cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "long green 
  peppers". Presumably these would be the mild green Hungarian peppers 
  common in the region. I did not use those because the ones my local 
  market had were much larger than I wanted. If you use the "mini-bells" 
  as I did, you will need 2 to 2-1/2 pounds depending on size (less 
  weight for larger ones). For thin walled green Hungarian peppers you 
  would probably need only 1-1/2 pounds. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for roasting the 
  peppers 10 minutes in the preheated oven, then peeling them. This will 
  not be nearly as easy as blasting them with your 
  <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and simply 
  brushing off the skins. The blasted peppers will still be quite 
  crunchy, which I don't have a problem with, but if you want them 
  softer, as they would be from the oven, just steam them for a couple 
  of minutes.</li>
