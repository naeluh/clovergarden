This salad is rather different from the standardized 
<a href="wgv_shopska2.html"><b>Soviet Shopska</b></a> now served all over the 
Balkans. Perhaps this is how it was made in Bulgaria before the Soviet 
era.

<p>The author of the pattern recipe, a noted Romanian gourmet, also has 
a recipe similar to the standard Soviet Shopska, calling it "Yugoslav 
Shopska".</p>

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ hrs - 45 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>If you have small unwaxed <b>CUCUMBERS</b>, cut in sixths 
    lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise. If standard waxed green 
    blimps, peel, cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the seed mass. Cut 
    halves lengthwise into narrow strips and slice fairly thin crosswise.
    </li>
  <li>In a non-reactive bowl, tumble <b>Cucumbers</b> with 1/2 t 
    <b>Salt</b> and let sit for at least 1/2 hour, preferably longer, 
    tumbling occasionally. Rinse and drain very well in a strainer 
    (this is to keep the salad from getting watery).</li>
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> small. Drain well (drink the juice with a 
    little salt).</li>
  <li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> (see <a href="wgv_shopska1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). 
    Brush off the skins under running water. Stem and seed them, and cut 
    into narrow strips about 3/4 inch long.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix both with 
    Peppers.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Salad Items</b> together well and chill thoroughly 
    before serving.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, stir in Sour <b>Cream</b>.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use Persian or European cucumbers 
  that don't need to be peeled or seeded. If all you can get are standard 
  waxed green blimps, you need to peel and seed them, then weigh them. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html"><b>Cucumbers</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sweet Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Light green Hungarian peppers are 
  preferred for this recipe, but are not always available in North 
  America, so green Anaheim Peppers may have to be used. The pattern 
  recipe calls for them to be roasted black and the skins brushed 
  off, in which case they will be softened. My skinning method leaves 
  them almost raw, which is the way I like them.  My opinion is that 
  skinning them this way improves both texture and flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Serrano:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for "long 
  green chili" without indicating how hot these are in Bulgaria, but 
  says to use half as much if too hot for you. I call for one Chili 
  Serranos, but presume they are hotter than what they have in Bulgaria, 
  so, if you have doubts, use half of one. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Sour Cream:</h3> &nbsp; Use a tart <u>natural</u> Sour Cream. 
  "Major Brand" sour creams tend to be chemical concoctions, and some 
  aren't sour enough to be worthy of the name.</li>
