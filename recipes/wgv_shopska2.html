This salad recipe was composed (along with several others that didn't 
catch on) in the 1960s by Balkantourist in Bulgaria. It quickly spread 
through the entire Soviet Balkan region.

Proportions of the ingredients vary throughout the region. It appears to 
be a variation on <a href="wgv_shopska1.html"><b>Bulgarian 
Shopska</b></a> which it has pretty much replace, even in Bulgaria. It 
is also known as "Bulgarian salad". Note that I have two very 
authoritative recipes with <u>no cucumbers</u>.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2+ hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>If you have small unwaxed <b>CUCUMBERS</b>, cut in quarters 
    lengthwise and slice fairly thin crosswise. If standard waxed green 
    blimps, peel, cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the seed mass. 
    Cut halves lengthwise into narrow strips and slice fairly thin 
    crosswise.</li>
  <li>In a non-reactive bowl, tumble <b>Cucumbers</b> with 1/2 t 
    <b>Salt</b> and let sit for at least 1/2 hour, preferably longer, 
    tumbling occasionally. Rinse and drain very well in a strainer 
    (this is to keep the salad from getting watery).</li>
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 1/2 inch. Drain well (drink the juice 
    with a little salt).</li>
  <li>Blast <b>PEPPERS</b> black with your <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"> 
    <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> (see <a href="wgv_shopska2.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). 
    Brush off the skins under running water. Stem and seed them, and cut 
    into narrow strips about 3/4 inch long.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix with 
    Peppers.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Salad Items</b> together well and chill thoroughly 
    before serving.</li>
  <li>At serving time, mix <b>Oil</b>, <b>Vinegar</b>, <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b> in a small jar, shake it vigorously and stir it into 
    the salad. Note: not much salt is needed because there is a little 
    in the cucumbers and a fair amount in the Sirene cheese.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Sirene Cheese</b> well and grate for garnish. Handle it 
    gently or it will mush together. Top individual servings with the 
    cheese (be generous here). Note: If serving buffet style in a big 
    bowl, crumble the Sirene rather than grating it so it will be more 
    durable and mix it in.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use Persian or European 
  cucumbers that don't need to be peeled or seeded. If all you can get 
  are standard waxed green blimps, you need to peel and seed them. 
  Weight is after peeling and seeding. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cucumb.html"><b>Cucumbers</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sweet Peppers:</h3> &nbsp; Light green Hungarian peppers were 
  probably originally used, but today both green and red Bell Peppers 
  are widely used. Some recipes call for them raw, but others call for 
  them to be roasted and the skins brushed off. My skinning method 
  leaves them almost raw, which is the way I like them. My opinion is 
  that skinning them this way improves both texture and flavor.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; While most recipes these days call for olive oil, 
  some Bulgarian sources say the only way to achieve authentic flavor is 
  with sunflower seed oil. This goes rancid quickly, so I rarely have it 
  on hand and use instead pure olive oil (not virgin).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Vinegar:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes are all over the map here, from "a 
  few drops" to twice as much as the oil. Here in California we like 
  our dressings fairly tart, thus the equal amounts. Use your own best 
  judgement here.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sirene Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; This cheese is sold as "Bulgarian Feta" 
  in North America, but in the EU, Greece has a monopoly on the word 
  "Feta", so it is called "Bulgarian White Cheese" among other names. 
  Easily available Turkish "White Cheese" is considered a much better 
  substitute than Greek feta for this recipe.</li>
