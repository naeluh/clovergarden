Wow - what a cascade of flavors! Not a dish for wimps, and definitely not 
for those who want their fish "white and light", but for those who 
actually like fish, it will be a revelation.

<p>The sweet vegetable sauce perfectly compliments the robust flavors 
of Atlantic Mackerel. I have changed the method (see <a href="wmf_maclem1.html#05">
<b>Note-5</b></a>) but not the ingredients, except to reduce amount 
of butter.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min + 45 min clean &amp; Fillet Fish)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean <b>MACKEREL</b> and fillet it. Don't attempt to skin 
    mackerel. Cut the fillets into chunks about 1-1/2 inches on a side. 
    Rub with 1 t Salt and set aside until needed.</li> 
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute, quench in cold 
    water, peel and dice medium.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>CARROTS</b> small. Peel <b>CELERY ROOT</b> and dice small. 
    Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Mix all with <b>Tomatoes</b> along with 
    <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
  <li> Slice <b>Lemon</b> for Garnish, if used.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr stovetop, 1-1/2 hr oven)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, (3-1/2 quarts is perfect) heat 
    <b>Butter</b> and fry <b>Sauce Mix</b>, stirring until well blended 
    and up to a simmer. Cover tightly and simmer the vegetables in their 
    own juices over low heat until well softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Bay Leaves</b> and pur&eacute;e <b>Sauce Mix</b> in a 
    food processor or by whatever means you have.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Lemon Juice</b> into the sauce.</li>
  <li>Clean the saut&eacute; pan.</li>
  <li>Melt 1 T <b>Butter</b> in the saut&eacute; pan and arrange the 
    <b>Mackerel</b> evenly in the pan.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Sauce</b> over the <b>Mackerel</b> and spread evenly. 
    Bring to a simmer. Cover tightly and simmer for about 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the <b>Parsley</b> evenly over the sauce. Cover and simmer 
    another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot. Goes well with steamed rice or Romanian polenta.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mackerel:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for whole, uncleaned fish. Choose 
  Atlantic (Norwegian) Mackerel, the perfect compliment to the sweet 
  vegetable sauce. Yes, they have Atlantic Mackerel in Bulgaria, it 
  infests the Black Sea. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_mackz.html"><b>Mackerels</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; [Celeriac] Accept no substitute. These 
  are reasonably available in produce markets today. Choose small ones 
  (about 1 pound) with lots of stems. Larger ones, and especially ones 
  with just one thick stem, tend to be very fibrous. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for a whole cup of 
  Butter. I considered this excessive for modern times and tastes and 
  cut it way back.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; Flat Leaf Only! Yes, that's 1 cup chopped 
  small, not a mistake. The Bulgarians probably picked this up from the 
  Turks, who treat parsley more like a vegetable than like an herb. Don't 
  skimp.</li> 
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe presumes cooking whole 
  fish with the sauce and finishing in the oven. In my opinion, messing 
  with heads, bones and fins on the plate can only detract from the 
  enjoyment of these unique flavors, so, without any apology, I violate 
  tradition. My method also allows this dish to be served in less 
  organized settings, such as buffet service, and with guests not 
  skilled in handling fish bones (most Americans).</li>
