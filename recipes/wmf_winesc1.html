A delicious Bulgarian fish stew that may be served warm or cold. 
While it is often served cold in In Bulgaria I prefer it hot with with 
rice or pasta.

<p>Traditionally it is finished in the oven. Our method does it all on the 
stovetop with notes on how to do it the traditional way if desired (see 
<a href="wmf_winesc1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH FILLETS</b> into fairly large chunks, perhaps 1-1/2 
    inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Make a slurry from <b>Oil</b>, <b>Flour</b> and <b> Paprika</b>. 
    Tumble with the fish until well coated. Set aside until needed.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute, quench in cold 
    water, peel and dice medium or slice medium depending on method 
    (see <a href="wmf_winesc1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CARROTS</b> about 1/3 inch thick. Peel <b>CELERY ROOT</b>, 
    slice about 1/4 inch thick and cut into short 1/4 inch strips. 
    Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice crosswise fairly thin. Peel 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and crush very lightly. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON</b> for juice - or slice Lemon (see 
    <a href="wmf_winesc1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (50 min stovetop, 1-1/4 hr oven)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan sufficient for the whole recipe, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Vegetable mix</b>, stirring often over 
    moderate heat until Onions are translucent.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> (if cooking on stovetop), then 
    <b>Sauce Mix</b> until well blended. Cover and simmer over moderate 
    heat until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>, then gently embed <b>Fish</b> into 
    the Vegetables so the pieces are covered or mostly covered. Bring 
    back to a simmer and simmer covered until fish is cooked through, 
    about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve hot or cold.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe suggested perch or cod, but 
  any light or moderate flavored fish that holds together reasonably well 
  with wet cooking can be used. The photo example was made with Tilapia, 
  since that's what was on hand. A little tender, but workable.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Celery Root:</h3> &nbsp; These are readily available in produce 
  markets today. Choose small ones with lots of stems. Larger ones, 
  and ones with just one thick stem tend to be fibrous. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/py_celerrz.html"><b>Celery Root</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 1/2 cup of Oil. I 
  considered this excessive for modern times and tastes and cut it in 
  half.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe presumes finishing this 
  dish in a casserole in a preheated 350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven for 30 
  minutes with fish between two layers of vegetables and slices of tomato 
  and lemon on top. This is a fine presentation for a sit-down dinner, 
  but less practical when preparing 1-1/2 or 2 recipes for buffet service, 
  especially here in sunny Southern California where we don't fire up an 
  oven unless we really need to. We have written this recipe so you can 
  easily adjust it to the traditional oven method if desired.</li>
