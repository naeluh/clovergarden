This famous beef stew uses an "absurd number of vegetables". Simpler 
versions were developed during the Soviet era, but this one is close to 
original.

<p>In Romania, this dish is often made half and half beef and pork. This 
recipe is better if rested overnight and reheated.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into cubes about 2/3 to 1 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Dice all <b>Diced mix</b> items, from fine to chunky depending on 
    your preference.</li>
  <li>Trim <b>OKRA</b> caps into a cone, avoiding cutting into the 
    inside. Mix with vinegar and let soak 20 minutes or more, tumbling 
    now and then (this keeps them from splitting during cooking). Rinse 
    well and drain.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water one minute, quench in 
    cold water and peel. Cut into quarters lengthwise and into 1/2 inch 
    slices crosswise.</li>
  <li>Tip and tail <b>GREEN BEANS</b> and cut in half crosswise, thirds 
    if really long.</li>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into moderate size florets.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>EGGPLANT</b>about 3/8 inch thick or as needed (see 
    <a href="wmm_cowchi1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Hold until needed in cold water 
    acidulated with a bit of Citric Acid or Lemon Juice.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ZUCCHINI</b> about 3/8 inch thick (see 
    <a href="wmm_cowchi1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>). Hold in the same water as Eggplant.
    </li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch cubes. Hold in 
    cold, but <u>not acidulated</u> water (acid hardens potatoes).</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (3 hrs)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>in a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Beef</b> over highest heat until all exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and the meat is lightly browned on all sides. Take 
    care the fond stuck to the bottom of the pan doesn't burn.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions </b> and <b>Paprika</b>. continue frying over 
    declining heat until onions are starting to color.</li> 
  <li>Stir in 1/2 c <b>Water</b>, cover tightly and simmer, stirring now 
    and then, until beef is not quite tender, about 30 minutes, depending 
    on cut.</li>
  <li>Drain all <b>Sliced mix</b> items and mix with all <b>Diced mix</b> 
    items, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and 3 T <b>Olive Oil</b>.</li>
  <li>Cooking:	 (see also <a href="wmm_cowchi1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).
      <br><b>Traditional Method</b>
      <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.</li>
      <li>Butter a casserole sufficient to hold the recipe.</li>
      <li>Layer half the <b>Vegetables</b> on the bottom, and layer the 
        meat over, then the other half of the vegetables on top.</li>
      <li>Pour over 1/2 cup <b>Water</b></li>
      <li>Cover the casserole (lid or foil) and place in the oven. 
        Bake for about 2 hours (do not stir - but shake the casserole 
	now and then to discourage sticking) or until the vegetables are 
	fully cooked. Test by sampling a chunk of Potato. Add a little 
	boiled water if it gets too dry. Take the lid off for the last 
	15 minutes to brown the tops of the vegetables.</li> 
      <li>Serve moderately hot. This dish is excellent served with 
        steamed rice.</li>  
      </ol>
      <b>My Method</b>
      <ol>
      <li>Butter the inside of a 4 quart slow cooker crock.</li>
      <li>Layer half the vegetables in the slow cooker. Layer the meat 
        over and the rest of the vegetables on top.</li>
      <li>Pour over 1/2 cup boiling <b>Water</b>.</li>
      <li>Cook on High setting until the vegetables are done, 2 to 2-1/2 
        hours. This can be tested by trying a chunk of potato.</li>
      <li>Serve moderately hot.  This dish is excellent served with 
        steamed rice.</li>
      </ol></li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without bones and all excess fat 
  removed.  Chuck is good for this recipe, round is ok but takes a bit 
  longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; Use long narrow eggplants if possible. If all 
  you have is a big globe eggplant, peel it and cut into 1 x 1 x 3.8 inch 
  pieces.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Zucchini:</h3> &nbsp; These should be very small diameter. If more 
  than 1-1/2 inch, cut disks in half.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose type potatoes work well here 
  because they become tender but hold together well. Avoid Yukon Gold 
  type potatoes, they disintegrate into mush if cooked 
  a little beyond the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.thml"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; If you will be reheating, stop cooking just a 
  shade less than done. I usually serve this buffet style, and want it 
  evenly mixed, so after the recipe is cooked, I pour it into a shallow 
  14 inch stainless mixing bowl, mix it gently, and either pour it into 
  a clean slow cooker for serving (set to "keep warm"), or seal it in 
  2-mil poly bags for refrigeration. For serving I heat back up in a 
  large saut&eacute; pan or similar, then pour into a slow cooker set 
  to "keep warm". Slow cookers, even on "High", take <u>forever</u> 
  to heat anything up.</li>
