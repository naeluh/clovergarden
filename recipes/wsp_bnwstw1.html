<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>White Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These should be large ones, Great Northern or 
  White Kidney Beans. They should be no more than a year old or they won't 
  cook well. Yes, soak with salt, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried 
  Beans</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This dish is made on the stovetop and finished 
  in the oven. In olden times it was made in a clay pot cooked for hours 
  at low heat in a wood fired oven. Today, recipes vary as to how long the 
  stovetop cooking, how hot the oven, and how long the baking. Traditionally 
  this dish is vegetarian for Fridays, Lent, and Church Holy Days, when meat 
  is forbidden. Otherwise it may be served accompanied with sausages or pork 
  ribs. Some recipes are more elaborate with a wider array of vegetables.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; After years of argument with Greece over the name 
  and flag, in 2019 Macedonia was renamed as North Macedonia, with a new flag. 
  It is still commonly called "Macedonia" by people and press. The other 
  Macedonia is called "Greek Macedonia". Tavche Gravche may have 
  been introduced to the region in the 15th century, but current styles date 
  no earlier than the 16th century, after Common Beans and Peppers were 
  introduced from the Americas. The name means "Beans in a Tava". Unlike in 
  India where a Tava is a slightly concave disk of steel, in the Balkans it 
  is a pan or pot.</li>
