The Turks bought corn from the Venetian Republic (when they were not at 
war). The Turks took it to Romania, where it was adopted as superior 
to millet for porridges and the like.

Mamaliga is much lighter and easier to make than Italian polenta, 
because of the coarse corn meal. This dish is now popular throughout 
the Balkans, Moldova and southwest Ukraine.

  <li>Bring <b>Water</b> to a boil. Stir in <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Butter</b>.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Cornmeal</b> very gradually, stirring constantly in the same 
    direction and keeping the water at a boil (see <a href="wsv_polen1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Simmer over very low heat, stirring frequently until the cornmeal 
    thickens, becomes elastic and starts to pull away from the sides of 
    the pot (25 to 35 minutes). 
  <li>Serve hot, or pour into a buttered pan. When cool, turn out 
    and cut as desired. If at all warm, cut with a thread as it will 
    stick to knives.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cornmeal:</h3> &nbsp; In Romania, coarse to very coarse yellow 
  cornmeal is always used, never fine cornmeal as for Italian Polenta. 
  Romanian cornmeal is orange in color, but we don't have that variety 
  here.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Method</h3> &nbsp; Romanians make this in a heavy cast iron pot 
  with a "U" shaped bottom. They stir it with a long handled wooden 
  spoon. I use a large saucepan with a heavy multi-ply bottom. It has 
  sharper corners, so I stir with a flat wooden spatula, which is also 
  good at scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent burning.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Options</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>While Mamaliga is still hot, stir in your choice of more Butter, 
    Feta type Sheep Cheese, Sour Cream or Herbs, or whatever combination 
    you prefer.</li>
  <li>Mamaliga is often served garnished with Feta type Sheep Cheese or 
    Sour Cream.</li>
  <li>Cut pieces of cold Mamaliga can be fried in Lard or Olive Oil until 
    lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Squares or other shapes of cut Mamaliga can be topped with Feta 
    type Sheep Cheese and and baked in a 375&deg;F/190&deg;C oven until 
    bubbly.</li>
  <li>Fresh hot Mamaliga can be layered in a buttered casserole with 
    a center layer of Kasseri Cheese and topped with bits of butter and 
    baked in a 375&deg;F/190&deg;C oven until lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Cut shapes of Mamaliga can be topped with jam and or confectioners 
    sugar to serve as desert.</li>
  <li>Slices or sticks are often fried with bacon for breakfast.</li>
  </ul>
