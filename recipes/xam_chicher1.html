This procedure will make the lightest, fluffiest Chicharr&oacute;nes 
you've ever seen - <u>without the explosive splattering</u>! 
These are mostly protein and have less fat than potato chips, and not 
over-salted like commercial products.  See <a href="xam_chicher1.html#04">

  <p>1-1/2 pounds of hog hide will yield about 9-1/2 ounces of 
    Chicharr&oacute;nes.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7-1/2 hours, (20 min work))
  <br>
  <ol>
  <li>Trim any fat from the <b>PIG SKIN</b>. If it is commercially 
    prepared there should be just a little around the edges. If you're 
    doing it yourself you've got quite a job there. 
    See <a href="xam_chicher1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> before discarding the fat.</li>
  <li>Cut the pig skin into the size pieces you want. About 2 inches by 3 
    inches is good. You can do this with a strong sharp knife or with 
    strong sharp kitchen shears. Either way it takes some effort - 
    there's a reason they used this stuff to make footballs.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Skins</b> in a pot with plenty of water and add a couple 
    tablespoons of <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 1 
    hour.</li>
  <li>Grease a couple of rimmed baking sheets, use lard, <u>not vegetable 
    oil</u> which dries to varnish and is hell to clean off the pans - 
    see <a href="xam_chicher1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.  
    Arrange the skins on the sheets fatty side down. Some may roll up and 
    refuse to lie flat - that's OK. Place the trays in the oven at 
    200&deg;F/95&deg;C. Use an oven thermometer since oven controls are 
    notoriously inaccurate at this low a temperature and the results will 
    be a bit different if the temperature goes over 212&deg;F/100&deg;C.
    A thermometer with a cable probe is very helpful, see that the tip 
    of the probe doesn't touch metal.</li>
  <li>Leave in the oven until completely dry and rigid like chips of 
    plastic, turning them once or twice. This will take more than 4 hours 
    depending on conditions. If they are not completely dry there will be 
    tough spots on the Chicharr&oacute;nes. I usually get the oven 
    temperature stable in the late evening and just leave them in 
    overnight.</li>   
 <li>At this point the pieces will be thoroughly mummified and can be 
    kept in a sealed jar until needed.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In an Indian <a href="../ke/kp_kadhaiz.html"><b>Kadhai</b></a>, 
    wok or other suitable vessel, heat enough <b>Oil</b> so that foamed up 
    pieces can be pushed mostly under the oil. This is why I recommend 
    a kadhai (best) or wok, it takes a lot less oil to get that depth in 
    the center.</li>
  <li>Heat the oil and keep between 440&deg;F and 460&deg;F/240 (225&deg;C 
    and 240&deg;C) for best foaming (450&deg;F max for peanut oil). Drop 
    in <u>just a few</u> <b>Pig Skins</b>. When they start to puff up turn 
    them constantly and push any with unpuffed spots below the oil. Once 
    they start puffing they will be done in 30 seconds or so. Repeat until 
    all are done.</li>
  <li>Drain well and cool thoroughly. Put up in a big plastic bag until 
    needed, tying it tightly closed to exclude moisture.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pig Skins:</h3> &nbsp; These can easily be found in meat markets 
  (Carniceria) serving a Mexican community. Very thin skin does not 
  puff up as well as medium thick. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_skinz.html"><b>Pig Skins</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Greasing your baking pans with lard will make them 
  easy to clean. If you don't have lard on hand, you have probably 
  trimmed enough fat from the edges of the sheet of hog hide to render 
  as much as you need. Fry over very low heat, and when done eat the 
  cracklings with a little salt. Lard, by the way, has a better health 
  profile than butter.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp;  Use a high temperature oil low in polyunsaturated 
  fats, preferably Olive Pomace, but Rice Bran Oil or Peanut Oil will do. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/oi_cookz.html"><b>Cooking 
  Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Background:</h3> &nbsp;  Be aware that "Chicharr&oacute;n" can mean 
  a lot of things in Spanish speaking countries other than the common 
  meaning in North America. "Chicharr&oacute;n" indicates a method of 
  cooking, not an ingredient. Even in Mexico, Delgado (thin) 
  differentiates these from Gordito (thick, with fat layer and some 
  meat attached).</li>
