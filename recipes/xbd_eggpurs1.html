A very tasty jumbled egg mix, one of my favorites. I use only a small 
amount of hot sauce to avoid masking the flavors. Substituting bacon for 
some of the lard won't hurt, either, but it can be made vegetarian.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Purslane:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is for leaves and 
  tender tips packed fairly tight. This herb/vegetable can be found in 
  markets serving Mexican, Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern communities. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/cn_purslz.html">Purslane</a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Yes, lard - unless you need it vegetarian. Lard 
  is "authentic" to Mexico, and isn't nearly as dangerous as the deadly 
  trans fats the AHA told you were healthier - and you survived those 
  (we hope). It even has a better health profile than butter. The eggs 
  don't stick as much with lard, but you can use olive oil instead. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> 
  page.</li>
