  <p> With refrigeration we can spread production over several days, 
  even a week, and our machines relieve us of endless grinding with 
  stones.</p>
   
  <b><u>Prep - 1 to 4 Days Ahead</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li><u>Roast your Turkey</u>: &nbsp; Roast vegetables in the pan and 
    plan on no gravy since you'll need the pan drippings and giblet stock 
    for the mole. The turkey can be done a couple days in advance. Full 
    procedures are on pages <a href="../ingred/turkeyroast.html"><b>
    Roasting a Turkey #1</b></a> and <a href="../ingred/turkeyroast2.html">
    <b>Roasting a Turkey #2</b></a>.</li>
  <li><u>Make Giblet Stock</u>: &nbsp; use all <b>Giblet Stock items</b>. 
    Chop vegetables medium. Split hearts and gizzards. Simmer for about 2 
    hours. Strain and use it to deglaze the pan when the turkey is done,  
    then defat the stock. You need to end up with 6 cups, so toss in some 
    chicken stock or stock you make from the turkey carcass. Refrigerate 
    until needed. See also <a href="xjc_molpublan1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li><u>Prepare Chilis</u>: &nbsp; (1 day ahead) Break the <b>CHILIS</b> 
    into large flat pieces and shake out the veins and seeds. Discard the 
    cores but keep at least 1T of the seeds for the Spices-1 mix.</li>
  <li>Heat 1/2 c <b>Lard</b> fairly hot and fry the <b>Chilis</b> a few 
    pieces at a time on both sides until aromatic. This should take about 
    30 seconds. <b>Caution:</b> be careful they are not at all burned or 
    they'll be bitter and your sauce will be ruined from the start. 
    Reserve the <b>Lard</b> for use in subsequent steps requiring lard.
    </li>
  <li>Drain <b>Chilis</b> on paper towels, then put in a large bowl and 
    add water to cover. Leave them to soak overnight. Taste the water, it 
    won't taste very good but if it has a bitter burned taste you have a 
    problem.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Mole Day</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Drain <b>Chilis</b> thoroughly. Run smooth in the food processor 
    with as little added water as you can get away with.</li>
  <li>Melt 1/3 c <b>Lard</b>, stir in <b>Chili pur&eacute;e</b> and 
    cook over moderate heat for about 10 minutes stirring constantly.
    </li>
  <li>Dry roast all <b>Spices-1 items</b> separately in a pan until they 
    become aromatic and darken just slightly, as you would to make curry. 
    Cool them and grind them all together along with all <b>Spices-2 
    items</b>.
  <li>Dry roast unpeeled <b>GARLIC</b> until the peel is charred, then 
    cool and peel.</li>
  <li>Heat 3 T <b>Lard</b> and separately fry <b>RAISINS</b> until puffed, 
    <b>ALMONDS</b> until medium brown, <b>PUMPKIN SEEDS</b> lightly, 
    <b>TORTILLA</b> until very crisp, <b>FRENCH BREAD</b> until browned. 
    Drain and cool.</li>  
  <li>Dice <b>TOMATILLOS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Run all <b>Thickeners items</b> (except lard) in the food 
    processor, along with the <b>Spices Mix</b>, until smooth, adding 
    only as much <b>Giblet Stock</b> as necessary.</li>
  <li>In a large saut&eacute; pan or heavy bottomed pot, mix together 
    <b>Thickener mix</b> and <b>Chili Pur&eacute;e</b>. Bring to a 
    simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
  <li>Break up <b>CHOCOLATE</b> into small pieces and stir into the pot. 
    Don't overdo the chocolate, the recipe amount is probably as much as 
    you want. Continue to cook over low heat stirring constantly for 
    about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Giblet Stock</b> a little at a time until sauce is of 
    a consistency that lightly coats a wooden spoon. It will take 5 cups 
    or so of broth.</li>
  <li>Taste for salt and adjust if needed (depends on if your turkey 
    was brined or salted for roasting).</li>
  <li>The sauce is now done, but unless you want a very rustic effect you'll 
    want to force it through a food mill or strainer. There will still be 
    a large amount of chili skins and seeds in it.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Serving</u></b>
  <ol start="17">
  <li>Mix <b>Turkey Pieces</b> into some <b>Sauce</b> and simmer until well 
    warmed. Adjust consistency as desired with more stock, I like it fairly 
    thin because I like to be able to taste the turkey.</li>
  <li>Freeze leftover sauce (you should have plenty).</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Turkey:</h3> &nbsp; Ms. Kennedy's recipe calls for a 7 to 8 pound 
  turkey, but it's real hard to find one much less than 20 pounds around 
  here. She cuts the turkey into "serving pieces", fries the pieces in 
  lard in a Dutch oven until browned, then drains off the lard, covers 
  the pan and roasts in the oven for about an hour at 
  325&deg;F/163&deg;C.  My plan roasts a normal size turkey the usual 
  way. Whether this mole recipe results in leftover turkey or is made 
  from leftover turkey isn't important.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; See our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page for details. 
  If you can't find Mulatos you can use all Anchos. If you can't get 
  Chili Negros (dried Pasillas) you can us Guajillos. Not quite the 
  same but it'll pass (Rick Bayless uses only Anchos and Guajillos).
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; Yup, lard - it isn't nearly as bad as the deadly 
  trans fats they told you were healthier, and you survived those (we 
  hope). Even by AHA measures, lard has a better health profile than 
  butter. For best quality, render your own lard. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>    
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomatillos:</h3> &nbsp; These are easy to find in the Southwest, 
  even in major supermarkets, but will be much cheaper in smaller markets 
  serving Mexican communities. In some areas you may still have to 
  purchase them canned. If so, use 1/2 cup drained.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Mexican Chocolate</h3> &nbsp; This is different from regular 
  baking chocolate. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ei_mexchocz.html"><b>Mexican Chocolate</b></a> page.
  </li>  
<li id="06">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; The Turkey, the Sauce and 
  the Tamales (if used) can be all be done well ahead, and the sauce will 
  improve with some rest.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>History</h3> &nbsp; Mole Publano has no relationship to 
  pre-columbian Mexico. The Aztecs would have been horrified at using 
  their sacred chocolate in a cooked dish, and there's no evidence that 
  was ever done. Using chocolate in recipes is a European thing. The most 
  likely origin is the Convent of Santa Rosa in Puebla de Los Angeles 
  (now Puebla de Zaragoza), in the State of Puebla, southeast of Mexico 
  City. This city has no Aztec history as it was founded by the Spanish 
  in a largely uninhabited area. It is said the nuns cobbled it together 
  for the visit of an Archbishop, and, from there, it became a national 
  festival dish. There are any number of recipes but ours is adapted 
  from one by Diana Kennedy, one of the foremost experts on Mexican 
  regional cooking.</li>
