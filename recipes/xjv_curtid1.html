  <p>Many recipes today just pickle the cabbage in vinegar. Our recipe 
  uses the traditional salt fermentation - just like real German / Polish 
  sauerkraut and Korean Kimchee (see <a href="xjv_curtid1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ days - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Core the <b>CABBAGE</b> and shred about 1/8 inch wide. I cut 
    cabbage in quarters lengthwise and slice each quarter crosswise.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Shred or grate <b>CARROTS</b> thin. I use a julienning vegetable 
    peeler.</li>
  <li>Cap, core and seed the <b>JALAPE&Ntilde;OS</b>. Dice small.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>All Vegetables</b> and weigh them accurately.</li>
  <li>In a large, non-reactive bowl, mix <b>Vegetables</b>, including 
    <b>Oregano</b>. Add <b>Sea Salt</b> at a ratio of 0.6 T per 
    pound of vegetables (0.0375 T per ounce) - thus 3-1/2 pounds (this 
    recipe) would need 2.1 tablespoons. In metric it's 11.1 grams per 
    pound (454 grams), or 0.7 grams per ounce.</li> 
  <li>Tumble very well to make sure the salt is evenly distributed. Let 
    the vegetables sweat and soften. Periodically, massage them firmly, 
    and pound them with your fists. About 45 minutes is good.</li>  
  <li>Pack into a crock or very wide mouthed jar, including all liquid - 
    and I do mean pack - push it down hard. Packed down, this recipe 
    should fit into a 1/2 gallon kimchee jar (what I use). By this time 
    there should be almost enough liquid to cover. Weight it to squeeze 
    more liquid out. A jar full of water, one that just fits into the 
    container, will do.</li>
  <li>In about 10 hours, enough liquid should have been squeezed out to 
    completely cover the vegetables. To be sure, add some brine to cover 
    by about 1 inch. The brine should be a shade less than one teaspoon 
    of salt per cup of water.</li>
  <li>Cover so nothing can get in, but not so tightly as CO2 can not 
    escape. The condiment can be used in about 3 days, flavor improves 
    if given 5 days. If you want to maximize probiotics, you can ferment 
    for 2 weeks or more. As it ferments, the vegetables may "heave" 
    (rise). If so, punch them down and add brine if you need to. 
    Fermentation stops when refrigerated, and it can be kept for months.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Jalape&ntilde;o:</h3> &nbsp; Two of these produce 
  a curtido with barely detectable heat. Use your own judgement as to 
  whether you want it hotter. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chili Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oregano:</h3> &nbsp; Properly, this should be 
  Mexican Oregano (<i>Lippia graveolens</i>), leaves of a shrub that 
  grows in the region. This is rather hard to find even here in 
  Los Angeles, so you may have to use regular oregano. Mexican Oregano 
  is a bit more minty in flavor, so maybe add a little dried mint.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sea Salt:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Important</u> - While 
  this recipe will ferment with regular table salt, it works better if 
  you use real, unrefined sea salt. Most major brands of "sea salt" may 
  have come from sea water but are heavily refined (they make more on the 
  stuff they refine out than on the salt). Those "trace minerals" are 
  important to proper fermentation. Also, they may contain flow agents 
  which will make your pickle cloudy. The best place to get real, 
  unrefined sea salt at an acceptable price is from a Korean market. The 
  Koreans do a <u>lot</u> of salt fermenting, and demand the real thing. 
  Note that the quantity of salt per pound is fairly critical.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Fermentation:</h3> &nbsp;  Aside from a generally 
  better flavor, naturally fermented vegetables are noted to improve gut 
  flora, which is held by many health practitioners to improve everything 
  else, including brain health.</li>
