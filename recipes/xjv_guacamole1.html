This famous Mexican dip for chips and vegetables is easy to make - if you 
can find avocados in the proper state of ripness or have time to let them 
ripen. Also see <a href="xjv_guacamole1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>, and 
<a href="xjv_guacamole1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Avocado:</h3> &nbsp; Use California 
  (Guatemalan/Mexican) avocados, not Florida (West Indian) avocados - 
  those are too watery. Flesh should be creamy ripe but without dark 
  spots. Yield from avocados varies with variety - you want to end up 
  with about 12 oz of flesh after removing the seed and rind. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ll_avocadz.html"><b>Avocados</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Keeping it Green:</h3> Most recipes include lime juice in an 
  attempt to keep the bright green color longer, others sprinkle lime 
  juice on top. The Los Angeles Times test kitchen mixes in 1 T of lime 
  juice. It doesn't enhance the flavor and it doesn't help a lot but 
  helps more than embedding avocado seeds which doesn't work at all 
  except where the seeds block off air. The best strategy is to prepare 
  all ingredients ahead except the avocado and mash that in at 
  the last minute. If you do have to prepare all ahead, pat down plastic 
  wrap to exclude all air and refrigerate.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Avocado Dip:</h3> &nbsp; Guacamole does <u>not</u> include 
  sour cream, or any other dairy product. In wet regions, Florida 
  avocados are grown - but you can't make guacamole from them - not enough 
  oil. To compensate, sour cream is added. This concoction is sometimes 
  called "guacamole", but that's not what it is, it is "avocado dip".</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is based on that given by Diana 
  Kennedy in <i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i> which uses no lime juice.</li>
