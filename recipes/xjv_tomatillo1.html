In Mexico cooked tomatillo sauce is served mainly with meats and as a 
recipe ingredient rather than as a condiment or dip, though I confess 
I've used it quite successfully slightly warm as a dip for fried tortilla 
chips.

    Some recipes call for you to char the skins of the chilis and 
    tomatillos and rub them off, but I've found this unnecessary if you 
    have a good food processor with a sharp metal blade. On the other 
    hand, it is very easy to do if you have a good propane torch.

  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b>, <b>CHILIS</b> and <b>GARLIC</b> small, mix.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> until onions are translucent, 
    then mix in <b>Tomatillos</b>, <b>Water</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Bring to 
    a boil and simmer covered for about 20 minutes stirring now and then.</li> 
  <li>Let cool somewhat, then grind in your <i>molcajete</i> or run in your 
    food processor or whatever you have until you achieve the desired 
    smoothness. For most uses that will be fairly smooth.</li>
  <li>Reheat and adjust salt to taste and thickness as needed by adding a 
    little water or by simmering uncovered to reduce the water. The sauce 
    should be pourable but not watery.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Tomatillos:</b> &nbsp; These are easy to find in 
  the Southwest, even in major supermarkets, but will cost a lot less in 
  smaller markets serving Mexican communities. You can also grow your own 
  anywhere tomatoes grow well. In some areas you may still have to 
  purchase them canned. If so, use 2 28 oz cans, drain them and cut them 
  in  quarters, draining off excess liquid, don't add any salt and cut 
  the cooking time down to about 10 minutes. Regular green tomatoes are 
  not an acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomatilz.html"><b>Tomatillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Chilis Serrano:</b> &nbsp; two chilis makes a 
  sauce that's pretty mild in Southern California but may seem otherwise 
  to folks from The Frozen North. Adjust for your taste, tolerance and 
  latitude. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
