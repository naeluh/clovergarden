This is an excellent all purpose sauce, good with just about anything, but 
especially with tortilla chips. It originated farther north, but has been 
enthusiastically adopted in Yucat&aacute;n - see also

    Some recipes call for you to char the skins of the chilis and 
    tomatillos and rub them off, but I've found this completely 
    unnecessary if you have a good food processor with a sharp metal 
    blade. On the other hand, it is very easy to do if you have a good 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>.
  <ol>
  <li>Strip husks from <b>TOMATILLOS</b>. Place them in a pot with water 
    to cover. Bring it to a boil, and when it has come to a boil simmer 
    for about 9 minutes. Drain and let cool for handling.</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILIS</b>, core them, shake out the seeds and chop coarse.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> coarse. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. Mix with Chilis.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> and mix with Chilis.</li> 
  <li>Put <b>All Ingredients</b> in a food processor and run until as 
    smooth as it will get, but see <a href="xjv_tomatillo3.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tomatillos:</h3> &nbsp; These are easy to find in 
  the Southwest, even in major supermarkets, but will cost a lot less in 
  smaller markets serving Mexican communities. You can also grow your own 
  anywhere tomatoes grow well. In some areas you may still have to 
  purchase them canned. If so, use 1-1/2 28 oz cans, drain them and cut 
  them in  quarters, draining off excess liquid, don't add any salt and 
  don't cook them, they're already cooked. Regular green tomatoes are 
  not an acceptable substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_tomatilz.html"><b>Tomatillo</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chilis Jalape&ntilde;o:</h3> &nbsp; 5 ounces 
  (3 pods the size they are here) gives this sauce a mild and pleasant 
  heat by Southern California standards, but if you're from the Frozen 
  North you might not agree. Use your own best judgement. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; This should be served fairly 
  soon after it is made, for in a few hours the pretty bright green of 
  the cilantro fades, and though the flavor is still good it gradually 
  gets runny in texture. If you must hold it for some time, strain out 
  excess water and stir the Cilantro in just before serving.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> I have two recipes from experts in the cuisines of 
  Yucat&aacute;n. They absolutely agree on the ingredients, and only 
  differ a few minutes on cooking the tomatillos, but are very different 
  on the proportions of the ingredients. My version doesn't exactly match 
  either, but it's really good.</li>
