A very simple tomato sauce used as an ingredient in many recipes 
from the Yucat&aacute;n region. The main difference from other simple 
tomato sauces is the traditional roasting of the vegetables, and that 
presents problems (see <a href="xjv_tomyuc1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Habanera Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This chili, with 
  its unique fruity flavor and fiery heat, is very popular in the 
  Yucat&aacute;n region (it's where the Jamaicans got them from). Here 
  in Southern California just about every market has them, but they may 
  not be much available in some regions. If not, the pattern recipe 
  suggests 2 fresh Jalape&ntilde;o or 3 Serrano chilis. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oregano:</h3> &nbsp; Properly, this should be Mexican Oregano 
  (<i>Lippia graveolens</i>), leaves of a verbina shrub that grows in 
  the region. This is rather hard to find even here in Los Angeles, so 
  you may have to use regular oregano with just a touch of dried mint. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/vb_mexoregz.html"><b>Mexican Oregano</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Chipotle:</h3> &nbsp; If you use the optional Chilis 
  Chipotle, the name becomes <i><b>Salsa de Jitomate de Chipotle</b></i>. 
  These are smoked Jalape&ntilde;os. The pattern recipe calls for 2 to 3 
  and presumes they are dry and need a long soak. The dry are available 
  here in Southern California, if you look for them, but here we have 
  the 7 ounce cans of Chipotles in Adobo Sauce. This is far more 
  convenient, but the chilis are smaller so use about 5 of them. 
  Consider, especially if you're from the Frozen North, not including 
  the Habanera if you use the Chipotles - using both makes the sauce 
  noticeably hot by Southern California standards. Any leftover 
  Chipotles can be served with scrambled eggs (delicious!) or frozen 
  for later. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_jalapz.html"><b>Jalape&ntilde;o, Chipotle &amp; 
  Morita Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Roasting the tomatoes and 
  onion is convenient in the Yucat&aacute;n - they're cooking on wood 
  fires with hot ashes and embers. Here it's not so convenient at all. 
  You can blast them with a powerful <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html">
  <b>Kitchen Torch</b></a>. They look blasted in seconds, but they really 
  need a lot more than that to affect the flavor at all.  On the other 
  hand, if you use the Chipotles, you get plenty of smoky flavor from 
  those, so the roasting means little. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_jalapz.html"><b>Jalape&ntilde;o, Chipotle &amp; 
  Morita Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
