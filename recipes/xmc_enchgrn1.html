  <p>Two methods are given: traditional (high calorie but richer) and 
  current (lower calorie). Two per serving is generally enough made by 
  the traditional method.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Shred <b>CHICKEN</b> (or Turkey) fine and mix with <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Roughly chop <b>TOMATILLOS</b>, <b>SERRANOS</b>, <b>CILANTRO</b> and 
    <b>GARLIC</b>. Run fairly smooth in a food processor along with 
    <b>Salt</b> and <b>Milk</b>,</li>
  <li>Heat 2 T <b>Oil</b> and cook <b>Sauce mix</b> over fairly high heat 
    for about 5 minutes. At this point I usually return the sauce to the 
    food processor, run it smoother, then return to a simmer in the pan. 
    Remove from heat and stir in <b>Crema Mexicana</b>. Keep warm in a 
    container sufficiently low and wide so you can dip the tortillas 
    through the sauce.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine for garnish.</li>
  <li>Mix just enough <b>Milk</b> in with the 1/2 c <b>Crema Mexicana</b> 
    that it is pourable but not too runny.</li>
  <li>Crumble <b>CHEESE</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 minutes)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Warm serving dish or a set of individual serving dishes.</li>
  <li>Prepare tortillas:
    <ol>
    <li><u>Traditional</u>: &nbsp; Heat <b>Oil</b> in a skillet (well 
      below smoking or the edges of the tortillas will become brittle) and 
      fry <b>Tortillas</b> one at a time on both sides just briefly, about 
      15 seconds per side (they must remain completely flexible) and drain 
      on paper towels. Keep warm.</li>
    <li><u>Current</u>: &nbsp; Set up a steamer with 1/2 inch water in the 
      bottom and bring to a boil. Wrap the tortillas in a heavy kitchen 
      towel and place in the steamer. Cover tightly and boil 1 minute, 
      then turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol> 
  <li>Using tongs, dip a <b>Tortilla</b> through the warm sauce to coat 
    both sides. Set on a warm plate, fill with some of the <b>Shredded 
    Chicken</b>, roll up and place in the serving dish or on individual 
    plates. Repeat.</li>
  <li><u>IF</u> you are making ahead or need to hold them and they have 
    cooled, this is the point at which you can reheat them. Arrange 
    them in a Gratin Dish or similar. When ready,warm in a 
    350&deg;F/190&deg;C oven.</li>
  <li><u>All Serving Methods</u>: &nbsp; Check that the remaining 
    <b>Sauce</b> is pourable, dilute a bit with chicken broth if not. 
    Re-heat sauce and pour over tortillas. Next pour over the 
    <b>Crema Mexicana mix</b>, then sprinkle with <b>Onions</b> 
    and crumbled <b>Cheese</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Turkey will also work fine. In Mexico the 
  chicken is simmered until quite tender, then allowed to cool in the 
  broth to retain moisture, after which the meat it is shredded.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatillos:</h3> &nbsp; These are easy to find in the Southwest, 
  even in major supermarkets, but will be much cheaper in small markets 
  serving Mexican communities. In some regions you may still have to 
  purchase them canned. If so, use 1-1/2 cup drained and add 1/4 
  teaspoon of sugar.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Serranos have recently gotten so large around 
  here just two makes this a medium spicy dish by Southern California 
  standards. Adjust to your preferences and tolerance. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Crema Mexicana</h3> &nbsp; This is sour cream, but a bit more 
  like Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che than ordinary sour cream. It's easily 
  available in markets serving Mexican communities.</li>
<li id="05"><b>Queso Fesco:</b> &nbsp; (Fresh Cheese). Farmers Cheese is 
  likely closer to actual Mexican Queso Fresco than many packaged 
  products labeled as such but is less firm and much harder to crumble.
  <li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; This oil is needed for the traditional method 
  only.<li>
