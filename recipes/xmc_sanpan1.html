  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs - 20 min work - up to 
    2 days ahead and refrigerate)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>CHICKEN PIECES</b> in a pot with water to cover by about 1 
    inch. They go in skin-on and bones-in. Bring to a boil, then simmer until 
    tender, around 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Chicken</b> from the broth and set aside to cool. Remove skin 
    and bones and return those to the pot to simmer another half hour or so 
    to strengthen the broth.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Broth</b> and remove all or most of the fat from it. The 
    amount of fat included in Panama would likely be too oily for North 
    Americans. For method see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Stock / 
    Broth</b></a> page.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Cut <b>Chicken</b> into about 1-1/4 inch pieces (a little less if 
    serving as a soup course),</li>
  <li>Peel <b>&Ntilde;AME</b> and cut into about 1 inch cubes (a bit smaller 
    if serving as a soup course). Get it under cool water <u>immediately</u>. 
    Do the same with <b>YUCA</b> and add to the &Ntilde;ame.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>Carrots</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch thick disks. Mix 
    with &Ntilde;ame.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> in quarters lengthwise and slice about 1/8 inch 
    crosswise. Crush <b>Garlic</b> and chop fine. Mix both with 
    &Ntilde;ame.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Corn</b> into 1 to 1-1/2 inch pieces, or see <a href="xmc_sanpan1.html#04">
    <b>Corn</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>OREGANO</b> small. Measure is after chopping and moderately 
    packed. If you use Dried Oregano, use about 2 teaspoons lightly crushed.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>Culantro</b> small. Add to Oregano along with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.</li></ol> 
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="11">    
  <li>Drain <b>Vegies mix</b> and place in a suitable pot (5 qt min (4-3/4 
    litre)). Stir in <b>Broth</b>. Add more (or Water) if needed to keep 
    Vegies under water. Bring to a boil. Turn to a simmer until roots are 
    tender, about 30 minutes more. The Yuca will be starting to break up, 
    but the &Ntilde;ame will still be somewhat crisp.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>, <b>Chicken</b>, and <b>Corn</b>. Adjust 
    liquid if needed, there should be a fair amount for serving with rice. 
    Bring back to a boil and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot. Place a bowl of steamed Rice on the 
    table with a  spoon, to be stirred into bowls of Sancocho as desired.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; In Panama, a whole, large, older hen (Gallina) 
  would be used, cut into pieces, flavorful, but tough. Old hens are hard 
  to find here in Los Angeles, so I use Thighs, with skin-on and bones-in. 
  These are convenient, have better flavor and texture than other parts of 
  the chicken, eliminate any conflict over parts, and are suitable for 
  <a href="xmc_sanpan1.html#06"><b>Buffet Service</b></a>. 4 pounds of bone-in, skin-on 
  thighs yields about 1 pound 14 ounces of cooked meat after skinning and 
  boning, and about 8 cups of very strong Broth. For how to make and store 
  Broth, see our <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a>.
  page. </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>&Ntilde;ame:</h3> &nbsp; This is a <u>real yam</u> NOT an orange 
  Sweet Potato. They come in White, Yellow, and Purple. Examine very 
  carefully for soft spots or spoilage. If not available, double the Yuca, 
  or replace with another root or vegetable. Malanga (Otoe) is often used, 
  as well as Green Plantains. White Potatoes and hard Winter Squash are also 
  used. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ym_yamtz.html">
  <b>Yam, White / Yellow</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Yuca:</h3> &nbsp; This root is now very available in North America. 
  It is heavily waxed to preserve it, but it is still very perishable, so 
  buy from a market with fast turnover and make sure it has no soft spots 
  at all. If it has purple streaks inside it is a bit old. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/sr_casavz.html"><b>Cassava / Manioc / Yuca</b></a> 
  page. </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Corn:</h3> &nbsp; The Corn (Maize) of Panama is tougher and less sweet 
  than that common in North America. Cut crosswise into 1 to 1-1/2 inch 
  lengths. Best to drive a thin, very sharp knife through with a soft faced 
  mallet. I find "on the cob" does not work well for buffet service.  People 
  avoid them because it's hard to eat them while standing around talking, 
  especially for older folks with compromised teeth. For Buffet I shave the 
  kernels off the cobs and stir them into the soup.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Culantro:</h3> &nbsp; [Sawtooth Herb] &nbsp; Popular in the Caribbean, 
  Central America, and Southeast Asia. Here in Los Angeles, this herb is 
  easiest to find in the large Asian markets. If you can't get it, use 
  Cilantro leaves and tender stems, but about twice as much, and put it 
  in right at the end of cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_culanz.html"><b>Culantro</b></a> page.</li>  
<li id="06">
  <h3>Buffet:</h3> &nbsp; Once done or reheated, pour into a Slow Cooker set 
  to "Keep Warm". You may also want a rice cooker full of rice next to it. 
  You can tell guests about adding rice to Sancocho, but don't be distressed 
  if they don't follow instructions, buffet guests rarely do.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Sancocho recipes vary by region, and even from 
  household to household. This recipe can be made as a main dish (usual) or 
  as a soup course (add more broth, cut items smaller). The recipe makes 15 
  cups + Corn Cobs. That's a lot, but it's a party recipe. It works very 
  well made ahead and reheated.</li>
