If I want to know how good a Mexican restaurant is I'll check out their 
Chilis Rellanos - they're sure to tell the tale. They aren't that hard 
to make, but take close attention.

  <p>This recipe is divided into segments, each of which can be a break 
  point - the first two segments can be done even days ahead. See 
  <a href="xmv_chilirell1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for general hints.</p>
  <b><u>Make Broth</u></b> &nbsp; (35 min) &nbsp; - &nbsp; This can be 
    done several days ahead.
  <ol>
  <li>Make <b>Tomato Broth</b> 
    <ol>
    <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> quite small, saving all the juice they're 
      packed in.</li>
    <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.
      Mix.</li>
    <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a saucepan and stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry 
      stirring until garlic starts to show color.</li>
    <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> including their juice. Stir in all
      <b>Seasoning items</b>. Simmer for at least 15 minutes. Simmer 
      uncovered if needed to get the consistency you want (fairly liquid). 
    </ol></li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Prep Chilis</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    This can be done one day ahead.
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Blast <b>CHILIS</b> with your 
    <a href="../ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> and rub off 
    the charred skin under cold running water. Split the chilis down one 
    side and scrape out the seed mass and ribs. A good thumbnail is the 
    best tool but a small spoon will work.</li>
  <li>If you are using Poblanos you should probably steam the 
    <b>Chilis</b> for just a couple of minutes to make them more flexible 
    and partially cooked - but don't overcook, they should remain very 
    crispy.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> on the course side of your grater. It will 
    grate easiest if very cold. I toss it in the freezer compartment 
    for a while.</li>
  <li>Dry the <b>Chilis</b> carefully inside and out. Stuff them as full 
    as you can get them and still have them stay closed. Pack the cheese 
    moderately tight and massage the chilis to arrange it so they close 
    well.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Deep Frying</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Get everything ready. There must be no hesitation or distractions 
    during the frying step.
    <ul>
    <li>Set out some <b>Flour</b> in a dish.</li>
    <li>Have a shallow ladle ready for ladling oil over chilis.</li>
    <li>Have a draining rack ready large enough to accommodate all your 
      chilis.</li>
    <li>Have ready some means to lift the chilis out of the batter and 
      into the oil. Tongs are a problem because the chilis are both heavy 
      and slippery at this point.</li>
    <li>Have ready a slotted turner or similar to lift chilis out of the 
      oil to the draining rack.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Separate <b>EGGS</b> into whites and yolks. Make sure there isn't 
      even a dot of yolk in the whites. Add <b>Salt</b> to the yolks.</li>
  <li>In a deep iron skillet or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> to 
    350&deg;F/177&deg;C. The skillet needs to be large enough to fit two 
    chilis with space to work the ladle.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>Egg Whites</b> stiff, then beat in <b>Egg Yolks</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. This batter is a little unstable so it can't be made too 
    far ahead.</li>
  <li><u>Working just 2 at a time</u> (see <a href="xmv_chilirell1.html#05">
    <b>Note-5</b></a>) roll <b>Chilis</b> in flour to coat very lightly, 
    shaking off any excess. Dip <b>Chilis</b> into <b>Egg Batter</b> to 
    coat completely, then set them into the <b>Hot Oil</b>. Immediately 
    start ladling oil over the chilis, very gently at first, then 
    vigorously as the batter stiffens. As soon as the chilis are lightly 
    browned top and bottom remove them to the draining rack.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan or buffet casserole, pour in enough of the 
    <b>Broth</b> to come about half way up the chilis when they are placed 
    in the pan. Arrange the chilis in the pan and bring up to a simmer. 
    Simmer until cheese is well softened but not running out. You can poke 
    a skewer through to see if the center is softened. This will be about 
    7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Ladle some broth on each plate and plunk a chili in it. Serve hot. 
    Rice is a good accompaniment.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3>  Fresh green Poblanos are the proper 
  chili to use and have a unique dark flavor. Select ones that are a 
  little flattish so they don't stand too high in the oil and broth. 
  Anaheims are often used in restaurants for availability, consistent 
  shape and size, or if they fear the unpredictable hotness of Poblanos.
  Flavor is different but they work OK. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Success depends on the quality of the cheese. 
  Supermarket industrial pseudo-cheese that turns into rubber <u>must 
  not be used</u>. Oaxaca or a really good Monterey Jack that melts 
  smoothly and is a bit stringy is fine. Other options include Queso 
  Quesadilla / Asadero and Queso Manchego (Mexican, not Spanish). If 
  in doubt, melt some as a test. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html"><b>Cheese Varieties</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil - Deep Fry:</h3> &nbsp; You need oil deep 
  enough to come half way up the chilis. While lard would most likely be 
  used in Mexico, Pure or Pomace Olive Oil (not Virgin) will do fine 
  if you are still afraid of Lard.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>General Info:</h3> &nbsp; Chilis Rellanos is one of the most 
  famous Mexican dishes so nearly all Mexican restaurants offer them - 
  with results ranging from pretty good to tragic. Doing this recipe 
  right takes more careful attention than is available in many 
  restaurants. To get around the trickiness many recipes use somewhat 
  the same ingredients but prepare and present them differently, and the 
  results just aren't the same. Best to learn to do it right - it just 
  isn't that hard.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Allow no distractions whatever during the 
  batter and fry steps. You must work without hesitation, paying close 
  attention. On the other hand, once fried, they can sit on the draining 
  rack for as long as 20 minutes before going into the broth.</li>
