These patties are made very similarly to how Chilis Rellenos are 
made. They aren't as hard to make as you might think from glancing at 
the instructions, but do take close attention.

  <b><u>Make Tomato Broth</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - 15 min work)
  <br>This can be done several days ahead.    
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> fine, saving all the juice they're 
    packed in.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> in a saucepan and stir in <b>Onion mix</b>. Fry 
    stirring until garlic starts to show color.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> including their juice. Stir in all
    <b>Seasoning items</b>. Simmer for at least 15 minutes. Simmer 
    uncovered if needed to get the consistency you want (it should 
    be quite liquid). Some cooks pur&eacute;e the broth.</li> 
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep Huauzontle</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hr min) 
    <br>This can be done one day ahead.
  <ol start="6">
  <li>Rinse <b>HUAUZONTLE</b> and strip all the flower buds from the 
    stems. Take care no stems or leaves or spoiled strings of buds are 
    included. This is tedious, do it sitting down at a table, with a 
    beer.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil, dump the <b>Huauzontle Buds</b> 
    into the water, bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain and wring out as dry as you can. Refrigerate if keeping 
    overnight.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Form Patties</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
    <br>This can be done hours ahead, or the evening before and 
    refrigerated.
    <ol start="8">
  <li>Cut <b>Cheese</b> into strips about 1/3 inch thick, 3/4 inch 
    wide and 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Set out a plate with <b>Flour</b> ("all purpose" is fine) for 
    rolling the patties in.</li>
  <li>Take a small handful of <b>Huauzontle</b> and squeeze out any 
    excess water. Place a piece of <b>Cheese</b> on it. Squeeze out 
    another portion of the <b>Huauzontle</b>, place it over the cheese 
    to cover, and mold it all into a patty. You'll have to massage it 
    quite firmly to get it to hold together.</li>
  <li>Roll <b>Patties</b> in flour to coat lightly. Shake off excess 
    flour.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Deep Frying</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Get everything ready. There must be no hesitation or distractions 
    during the frying step.
    <ul>
    <li>Have a shallow ladle ready for ladling oil over patties.</li>
    <li>Have a draining rack ready large enough to accommodate all your 
      patties.</li>
    <li>Have ready some means to lift the patties out of the batter and 
      into the oil. Neither tongs nor turners work really well, but 
      that's what we've got. Lifting up with a turner, then picking 
      off with tongs and lowering into oil can work.</li>
    <li>Have ready a slotted turner or similar to lift patties out of the 
      oil to the draining rack.</li>
    <li>Separate <b>EGGS</b> into whites and yolks. Make sure there isn't 
      even a dot of yolk in the whites. Add <b>Salt</b> to the yolks.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>In a deep iron skillet or similar, heat <b>Oil</b> about 5/8 
    inch deep to 350&deg;F/177&deg;C. The skillet needs to be large 
    enough to fit two or three patties with space to work the ladle.</li>
  <li>While oil is heating, beat <b>Egg Whites</b> very stiff, then 
    beat in <b>Egg Yolks</b>. This batter is a unstable, so it can't 
    be made ahead.</li>
  <li><u>Working just 2. or at most 3, at a time</u>, dip <b>Patties</b> 
    into <b>Egg Batter</b> to coat completely and fairly thickly, then 
    set them into the <b>Hot Oil</b>. Immediately start ladling oil over 
    the Patties, very gently at first, then vigorously as the batter 
    stiffens. Don't let the oil get too hot, you need the inside hot 
    before the outside gets too brown. As soon as the patties are 
    lightly browned on top and medium browned on the bottom, remove 
    them to paper towels on a draining rack.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Serving</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 min)
    <br>Here we have several option. For option 2 and 3, the Patties 
    and Tomato Broth could even be refrigerated overnight. 
  <ol>
  <li><b>Serve as is:</b> &nbsp; For this method you need to have the 
    Tomato Broth fully hot before you start frying, and will need 
    individual dishes, preferably heated. Place a ladle of hot Tomato 
    Broth in a dish and place one or two  Huauzontle patties, still hot 
    from frying, over the broth. Get it out on the table immediately.
    </li>
  <li><b>Warmed in Broth:</b> &nbsp; This method gives you more time. 
    Pour about 3/4 inch of the <b>Broth</b> into a shallow stovetop 
    casserole or similar. Arrange the <b>Patties</b> in the pan and 
    bring up to a simmer. Simmer until well warmed through, about 5 
    minutes, or 8 minutes if refrigerated. Ladle some broth on each 
    plate and plunk a Patty in it. Serve hot. Even more convenient, 
    you can do this in an electric frying pan set to just simmer.</li>
  <li><b>Oven Heating:</b> &nbsp; Personally, I think this method 
    gives the best results. Use tiny casseroles or similar ovenproof 
    dishes. Spoon out a ladle of Broth into each and place one or two 
    Patties on top. Lightly cover with foil and put into a 
    350&deg;F/175&deg;C oven. Let bake until about 175&deg;F/80&deg;C 
    in the center. Remove the foil when about half way. Set out on the 
    table in the baking dish.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Huauzontle:</h3> &nbsp; This is an unusual ingredient, 
  but I have found it here in Southern California in late September and 
  early October. Weight is "on the stems". For details see our  
  <a href="../ingred/ch_huauz.html"><b>Huauzontle</b></a> page. In the 
  future I will try developing a way to use broccoli florets as a 
  substitute, though they are much more delicate.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for 
  Panella, a fresh cheese that softens well but does not melt. In other 
  regions, Oaxaca or similar good melting cheeses may be used. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html"><b>Cheese Varieties</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil - Deep Fry:</h3> &nbsp; You need oil deep 
  enough to come almost half way up the Patties. While lard would most 
  likely be used in Mexico. If you are still afraid of Lard, Pure or 
  Pomace Olive Oil (not Virgin) will do fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Frying:</h3> &nbsp; Allow no distractions whatever 
  during the batter and fry steps. You must work without hesitation, 
  paying close attention. On the other hand, once fried and on the 
  draining rack, they can be held - see <b>Serving</b> above.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; These are delicious, but 
  clearly a bit of a project, so why would you want to make them? Perhaps 
  your aunt Hilda left you a big bundle of Huauzontle, and expects photos 
  to be posted. Perhaps you're really curious about new tastes and 
  textures, or perhaps you just love your craft - and if you don't 
  love your   craft, maybe you should be over or Rachael Ray's site 
  instead of Clovegarden.</li>
