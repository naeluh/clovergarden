Blind tamales (tamales with no filling) are served with dishes like 
Mole Poblano de Guajolote which include a strong sauce. Generally three

How much filling you can use depends on the dimensions of each corn 
husk. Completed tamales will probably weigh between 1-1/8 ounces and 
1-7/8 ounces. You should get about 36 tamales with a coarse masa, over 
40 if it's quite fine (it absorbs more broth).
<ol>
  <li>Start the <b>CORN HUSKS</b> soaking in hot water. They need to soak 
    for several hours before use. Drain them well and wipe off any free 
    water with a towel before filling. Keep in mind these dry very quickly 
    so keep them moist.</li>
  <li>All dough ingredients must be at a cool room temperature because the 
    lard must not melt during beating. If necessary refrigerate to cool 
    and then continue beating.</li>
  <li>Measure out 1 pound of <b>MASA</b> and mix in the <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Beat <b>Lard</b> in a mixer for about 5 minutes to incorporate 
    air, then start adding <b>Masa</b> and <b>Chicken Broth</b> 
    alternately. If your Masa is fine you'll need more broth than listed 
    in the recipe. The dough should be soft and spoonable but not runny or 
    crumbly.</li> 
  <li>When all masa and broth are in, continue beating for another 3 
    minutes or so. Test by setting a small piece of dough on the surface 
    of a bowl of water. If it sinks, continue beating until it floats. 
    If it just won't float see <a href="xsm_tamaleb1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Beat in the <b>Baking Powder</b>.</li>
  <li>Tear a few of your longest husks lengthwise into tie strips.</li>

  <li>Fill, wrap and tie:
    <ol>
      <li>Lay out a <b>Corn Husk</b> and wipe off any free water. Place 
        a lump of <b>Dough</b> about 3/4 inch thick, leaving about 1-1/2 
	inches at the wide end and 3 inches at the pointy end.</li>
      <li>Wrap lengthwise as shown taking care that the wide end isn't 
        too wide.</li>
      <li>Fold down the pointy end and crease the fold with thumb and 
        forefinger so it stays put</li>
      <li>With thumb and forefinger held crosswise squeeze the filling down 
        from the wide end and fold it over the tip of the pointy end. Make 
        sure the wide end completely covers the opening at the pointy end 
        because it has to act as a roof to prevent water from dripping in.
        </li>
      <li>Hold the wide end down as shown and with your other hand wrap a 
        strand of husk around it, then use both hands to tie.</li>
      </ol>
  <li>Arrange in a steamer. Place tamales vertically with the wide end 
    flap at the top to prevent entry of water. They should be firmly 
    packed but not jammed as they will expand somewhat. Cover with spare 
    corn husks set like roof shingles to keep water from dripping back 
    into the tamales.</li>
  <li>Fill the bottom of the steamer with water and toss in a quarter. This 
    coin will tell you if there's a problem (it'll stop rattling or rattle 
    too fiercely).</li>
  <li>Bring the water to a boil, then place the top part of the steamer 
    with the tamales in it on the bottom. Keep the water bubbling well but 
    not boiling fiercely. Listen to the coin, it should rattle for a second 
    or so followed by a second of silence, then rattle again. If it rattles 
    continuously the heat is too high or you are nearly out of water. If 
    it stops rattling the heat is too low or you are out of water - neither 
    condition should be allowed.</li>
  <li>Start more water simmering to renew the steamer water when needed.
    </li>
  <li>Steam for about 2-3/4 hours, then test. Pull a tamale and place it  
    on the counter for a couple minutes to steam off and drop a few 
    degrees. The dough should then be firm and the husk should peel off 
    cleanly. If that passes, cut one in half and inspect the center.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm. Once made, they can be kept refrigerated up to a week 
  and reheated in a pan, on a griddle or in the oven. They can be frozen 
  for longer storage and put directly from the freezer into a 350&deg;F 
  oven for 30 minutes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Corn Husks</h3> &nbsp; Those sold in most of 
  North America are trimmed and ready to go. A 6 oz package will have 
  enough for this recipe. Use a couple of the longest for tie strips, 
  use the shortest to pad the steamer, and as many as needed for 
  stuffing. If you use husks fresh from the cob cut off the cupped end 
  so they'll lie flat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Masa</h3> &nbsp; This is flour of corn that has 
  been treated with lye to remove the skins. Corn meal is not an 
  acceptable substitute. A course masa is good for tamales but if all 
  you can get is fine that will do but it'll use a lot more broth. Fresh 
  Masa is often available from markets serving a Mexican community - look 
  in the refrigerated (not frozen) cases. If you have that, just beat 
  together with the lard.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; No, nothing else will work - 
  but it isn't nearly as bad as the deadly trans fats they told you were 
  healthier, and you survived those (we hope). Even by AHA measures, lard 
  has a better health profile than butter. For best quality, render your 
  own lard. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_lardz.html"><b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>  
<li id="04">
  <h3>Beating:</h3> &nbsp; Dough that doesn't float will 
  result in a stiff heavy tamale. If your dough just won't float, 
  refrigerate until well chilled and then beat some more. Note: with my 
  monster KitchenAid mixer, the wire whisk did not produce a floating 
  dough even with extended beating. The regular paddle had it floating 
  right away because the thicker shape pulled air down into the dough 
  efficiently.</li>
