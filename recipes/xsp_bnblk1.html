Black Beans made this way are served everywhere in the Yucat&aacute;n 
region, taking the place of the refried beans served in the north. 
In some regions they are made almost soupy, but in others they are made 
quite thick.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hrs - 5 min work)  
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>BEANS</b> in a big jar with 1/2 T Salt and water sufficient 
    to re-hydrate the beans. Let sit in a warm place overnight.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Beans</b>. Place in a sauce pan and pour in 
    water to cover by 1/2 inch or so. If they have been well soaked they 
    won't absorb much more. Bring to a boil uncovered (to eliminate 
    foaming over), turn down to a slow simmer, cover tightly and simmer 
    1 hour.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>ONION</b>, leaving root end intact. Slice lengthwise into 
    several wedges, making sure each wedge has some of the root end to 
    hold it together.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>EPAZOTE</b> quite small, or see <a href="xsp_bnblk1.html#03">
    <b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>HABANERO</b> black with your propane torch. Brush off 
    skin under running water. Remove stem and chop small.</li>
  <li>When <b>Beans</b> have simmered an hour, stir in all 
    <b>Flavoring items</b> Check water. Bring 
    back to a boil and simmer tightly covered for another 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Water</b> but retain it. Remove <b>Onions</b> as best you 
    can. Crush beans to a paste, to whatever smoothness you prefer, 
    adding back just enough of the water to get the consistency you 
    desire. The photo example is crushed moderately and made quite 
    stiff.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Black Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are the favorite 
  bean of the Mayan region and should not be substituted. Why the 
  salt? See <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried 
  Beans</b></a> for details.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onion:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  "2 small onions". Onions that small can be hard to find in Southern 
  California, so I specify 1 7 ounce onion (small onions are 4 oz or 
  less).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Epazote:</h3> &nbsp; Amount is for fresh chopped quite 
  small. While fresh is erratically available here in Southern California, 
  the pattern recipe presumes you can't get it and calls for 1 T dried, 
  but dried is much inferior to fresh. There is no substitute, so if 
  you can't get either, you'll just have to leave it out. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/ch_epazoz.html"><b>Epazote</b></a> page.</li>  
<li id="04">
  <h3>Habanera Chili:</h3> &nbsp; This chili, with 
  its unique fruity flavor and fiery heat, is very popular in the 
  Yucat&aacute;n region (it's where the Jamaicans got them from). Just 
  about every market has them, or the equivalent Scotch Bonnet, but they 
  may not be much available in some regions. The pattern recipe suggests 
  2 fresh Jalape&ntilde;o or 3 Serrano chilis. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
