Essential for the cuisines of northern and central Mexico. This recipe uses 
Lard for authenticity, or Olive Oil for vegetarian. "Refrito" means 
"well fried", not fried twice.

  <b><u>IF Using Dried Beans</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (9 hrs - 10 min work)  
  <ol>
  <li><u>IF</u> using <b>Dried Beans</b>, Place 1-1/3 cups in a big jar with 
    1/2 T Salt and water sufficient to re-hydrate them. Let sit in a fairly 
    warm place 8 hours or overnight.</li>
  <li>Drain and rinse <b>Beans</b>. Place in a sauce pan and pour in water 
    to cover by an inch or so (a lot more if not soaked). Bring to a boil 
    uncovered (to eliminate foaming over), turn down to a slow simmer, 
    cover tightly and simmer 50 minutes or until quite tender.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (10 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Chop Onion very fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>Garlic</b> well and chop very fine.</li>
  <li><u>IF Using</u> &nbsp; Grind <b>Cumin</b> and mix with <b>Chili 
    Powder</b></li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Drain <b>Beans</b> and rinse.</li>
  <li>In a well seasoned iron or heavy non-stick pan, heat <b>Lard or Oil</b>.
    Fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent, but no browning. Stir in <b>Garlic</b> 
    and <b>Salt</b>, and fry stirring another 30 seconds. <u>If using</u>, 
    <b>Optional</b> flavorings, stir in along with Garlic.</li> 
  <li>Keeping over moderate heat, start spooning in the <b>Beans</b>, crushing 
    with a Potato Masher or similar until you get the texture you want. It 
    should not be mashed smooth, but can be medium or quite coarse as you may 
    wish. Add a little <b>Water</b> as needed to get the consistency you want 
    - it should be fairly dry.</li>
  <li>Continue to fry the <b>Beans</b>, uncovered and stirring often, for 
    another 3 minutes. Adjust with a little water if needed. It should be 
    fairly dry, but with enough moisture to cake in the pan.</li>
  <li>Cover to keep warm and serve as soon as possible. The beans can be 
    carefully reheated, adding a minimum amount of water, or by steaming.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pinto Beans:</h3> &nbsp; These are the best beans for Refried Beans, 
  and easily available in North America. To start with dried beans, 
  1-1/4 cups will yield 3 cups. 2 15oz cans of Pinto beans will be 3 cups. 
  There will not be a lot of difference in flavor or texture. Salt? See 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_soak.html"><b>Soaking / Brining Dried Beans</b></a> 
  for details.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Onion:</h3> &nbsp; White Onions are used in Mexico, but there will be 
  little difference if you use yellow onions.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Optional:</h3> &nbsp; These flavorings are not much used in Mexico, 
  but are popular in North America. Choose any Chili Powder you like. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / 
  Flake</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lard or Oil:</h3> &nbsp; In Mexico Lard would be used. The 
  flavor difference between the two is quite significant, so if you don't 
  need it vegetarian, feel free to use Lard, it isn't the "heart killer" 
  it was once thought to be. Pure Olive Oil is fine, Virgin may have too 
  much Olive flavor. Others can be used. You will have less sticking 
  problems with Lard.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Garnishes:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional garnishes in Mexico are Tortilla 
  Chips and aged Grated Cheese (Cotiga, or A&ntilde;ejo, but Fresco can be 
  used). See our <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html#mex"><b>Mexican 
  Cheeses</b></a>. Cilantro and Lime Wedges are often used in North America.
