<h1>Roasting / Peeling Vegetables</h1>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv13h.jpg" alt="Fresh Vegetables to be Peeled" class=mrg>
<br>[<h3>Mexico, India, and everywhere else.</h3>]
<p>
Many Mexican recipes, particularly from the Mayan region in the south, 
call for roasting (or toasting) garlic, onions, chilis and other 
vegetables. That's easy for them, they just place the whole vegetables 
in hot ashes from the hearth fire they cook over. Here in Sunny Southern 
California (and I imagine some other parts of the United States and 
Canada), we rarely have a hearth fire going, so getting hot ashes is 
quite inconvenient. We need to do our roasting some other way which will 
have the same effect.

<h2 class=lrg>Equipment</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Comal</h2>
<br><img src="img/ke_mex02e.jpg" alt="Tools" class=mrg>
I strongly recommend the Lodge L9OG3 round cast iron griddle, which has 
enough edge to keep small rolly things from falling off the edge, though 
a regular Mexican Comal or Indian Tava would work. You don't want to use 
your carefully seasoned iron skillet, because this device needs to be 
unoiled and will become very, very hot. How hot? I don't know, my 
infrared thermometer doesn't go over 500&deg;F/260&deg;C, but it's pretty 
much up there.
<p>It's also great for roasting spices for curries, heating tortillas or 
chapatis, toasting parthas, and a whole lot of other things.</p>
<p>You also need a good set of tongs for handling larger hot rolly items 
like chili peppers, and a very thin turner for tossing small items in the 
pan.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Gas Torch</h2>
<p><img src="img/ke_torch01g.jpg" alt="Map Gas Torch" class=mrg>
Yes, you want this - no, you need this!  It will save you endless hours 
and frustration within almost every cuisine on the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>Every cookbook will give you one to three methods for skinning bell 
peppers and chilis. They all work equally well, which is to say, none of 
them works at all well. This device will turn charring a bell pepper's 
skin into a matter of seconds. It can also be used to flame peel 
tomatoes, chilis of any size or shape (but doesn't work well on eggplants. 
It'll instantly burn the pricklys off cactus pads, spiky chayotes and 
similar annoyances, making them safe to handle, and it'll burn the fuzz 
off a freshly feathered chicken, or a few stray hairs off a pig foot. It 
can also be used for burning the char off stove burners, repairing 
plumbing, lifting floor tiles, blistering paint and even browning those 
fancy Cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e deserts (if you hold it back a 
ways).</p>
<p>The downside, but for only a very few recipes, is that bell peppers 
and chilis are charred so fast they are still completely raw. This is an 
advantage for most recipes, particularly salads, but a few recipes 
expect the peppers to be cooked by their recommended skinning method - 
just steam them a minute or two after brushing off the skin.</p>
<p>The yellow cartridge means "Map Gas" (actually the gas mix that 
replaced map gas), which burns much hotter than propane. A propane torch 
(blue cartridge) is usable, though not as efficient, as long as the 
flame is fairly wide.	Map gas is more expensive, but, hey, a single 
cartridge lasts me three to five years in normal kitchen use.

<h2 class=lrg>Vegetables</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Garlic</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv1e.jpg" alt="Roasted Garlic Cloves" class=mrg>
In Mexico, they would just put a whole head of garlic in the hot 
ashes of the hearth fire and roast it until blackened and cooked 
through. That isn't practical here in Southern California, as hot 
hearth ashes are usually in rather short supply in our kitchens.
<p>Just break up the head, without peeling. Bring your comal up good 
and hot on a high burner. Toss the garlic cloves around on the comal 
until they are lightly charred on the outside and cooked through. It 
only takes a few minutes. Let them cool, and peel off the skins, 
which will now come off very easily.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Onions</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv3e.jpg" alt="Roasted Onion Slices" class=mrg>
Just tossing a whole unpeeled onion into the hot ashes of the hearth 
fire to roast is just fine, if you have hot hearth ashes and enough 
experience to know how long and how hot to roast. All those factors 
can be hard to find here in Southern California (except the 
onion - we grow a zillion tons here), so we need a different method.

<p>Since the roasted onions are usually cut up and/or cooked to mush, 
it's fine to peel them and cut them into thick slices for roasting. 
Lining the pan with aluminum foil is a suggestion from Rick Bayless, an 
expert in Mexican cooking. It avoids sticking problems and certainly 
makes cleaning the pan a whole lot easier. As with garlic, heat the pan 
very hot on a high burner. The photo specimens were lightly browned 
and still crunchy in the middle, but you can also roast them black if 
you want them very soft and with a charred flavor. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Chilis <small>&amp;</small> Bell Peppers - Fresh</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv6e.jpg" alt="Blackened chilis" class=mrg>
<p>Here the torch really shines. All the chilis in the photo took only 
seconds to blacken, literally. Bell peppers may take about a minute 
because they are so large. No, there was not a hint of chili 
fumes - I only encounter those when cleaning up my tools and working 
surfaces with hot water, wow!</p>
<p>All that remains now is to brush off the skins under running water,  
using a regular vegetable brush or similar. They brush off very easily. 
If a few flakes still cling to the chili, that's not a problem, and may 
enhance flavor in some recipes. 
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Dried Chilis</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv8e.jpg" alt="Blackened chili" class=mrg>
In both Mexico and India, dried chilis are pan roasted similar to the 
garlic cloves above. This enhances their flavor and makes them flexible. 
They are done when they are blackened but not burned.
<p>The torch can also be used, and is very fast, but must be used with 
care, and from a greater distance than for fresh chilis. At the first 
hint of smoke, pull back and let that part cool while doing another 
part. The dried New Mexico chili in the photo was torch roasted, with 
considerable care, and did not taste burned. In fact, it was delicious - 
I ate the whole thing just as it was.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Tomatoes</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_roastv11e.jpg" alt="Blackened Tomato" class=mrg>
The usual way of skinning tomatoes is to scald them 1 minute in 
rapidly boiling water, quench in cold water, core and peel. They can 
also be easily torch peeled, and the tomato hardly warms up. the 
outer skin blackens and shatters almost instantly, but there is a 
wetter inner skin, which is loosened, but you need to pull the skin 
off, as you would with scalding, not brush it off.
<p>If you want to drive a significant amount of roasted flavor into 
the tomato, you have to torch it a lot longer than you might think, 
to blacken that wet inner skin.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>Cactus Pads</h2>
<br><img src="img/xtx_nopal12e.jpg" alt="Prepared Cactus Pad" class=mrg>
The torch makes quick work of disarming this difficult to handle 
vegetable, burning the spines to nothing in seconds. It can then be 
handled without pain while preparing it for recipes. The cactus pad 
in the photo is prepared and ready to slice. You will find a lot more 
detail on our <a href="../ingred/cc_nopalz.html">Nopales - Prickly 
Pear Pads</a> page. The torch works just as well disarming the fruits 
(Tunas). 
<br class=cll><p></p>

<h2>Prickly Chayotes</h2>
<br><img src="img/sq_chayot18e.jpg" alt="Two Prickly Chayotes" class=mrg>
These guys are really nasty, and they can get you right through 
plastic bags and even gloves, but the torch disarms them completely in 
a matter of seconds. Why deal with prickly chayotes at all? Because they 
have better flavor than those pale green ones.
