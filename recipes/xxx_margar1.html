A cocktail from Mexico, of disputed origin but now widely popular. This is a 
very simple recipe, and simple recipes depend on quality ingredients.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tequila:</h3> &nbsp; This <u>must</u> be a White Tequila (Blanco, 
  Plata, Silver), and it <u>must</u> be 100% Agave. If it doesn't say 100% 
  Agave on the bottle, it's a Mixto with sugars added before fermentation. 
  Mixtos make an inferior Margarita. Buy a good quality 100% Agave Tequila, 
  and expect to pay more than 2021 US $20 for a 750ml bottle.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Triple Sec:</h3> &nbsp; This is a generic term for orange peel flavored 
  liqueurs. Quality varies, and what you use should be good enough to drink 
  straight. Cointreau is generally considered best, and they claim it to be 
  the original, but their origin story (1948) seems a little late in the game. 
  Theirs is 80 Proof (40% alcohol). If you want less alcohol, there are 30 
  Proof versions (15% alcohol). Hiram Walker has one with decent flavor from 
  "all natural ingredients". </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Salt</h3> &nbsp; The traditional plan is to make a cut in a slice or 
  wedge of lime, and run the cut around the rim to moisten it. The rim is then 
  touched into a plate of medium grain salt which adheres to the rim. The 
  lime is then stuck on the rim and the Margarita poured in. An alternative 
  is our <a href="9ys_salcit1.html"><b>Salt-Citrus</b></a> salt (with 
  lime zest) which requires no lime, but is probably better for straight 
  Tequila (Plata or Reposdo (barrel aged)).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Proportions:</h3> &nbsp; These vary. Making this recipe with 2-1/4 ounces 
  Tequila, 1 ounce Triple Sec, and 3/4 ounce Lime Juice would be pretty close 
  to the IBA (International Bartender's Association) formula, but another 
  common formula reduces the Tequila to 2 ounces, and some to 1-1/2 ounces. 
  If you're serving pitchers of Margaritas for a party, you may want t cut the 
  Tequila back to the minimum.</li>
<li id="05">
  <img src="img/kg_margar01n.jpg" alt="Margarita Glass" class=col>
  <h3>Glass:</h3> &nbsp; The original is the "Rocks Glass", as in the photo 
  at the top, and it is still used. It's usually about 11 ounces. The stepped 
  diameter cocktail "Margarita Glass", shown to the left, is specified by the 
  IBA (International Bartender's Association) and used in nearly all 
  restaurants and most bars, at least around here. It is important in such 
  establishments that the waitress or bartender can tell by the shape of the 
  glass what a customer is drinking, without having to ask. There are also 
  various wide bowled "Margarita Glasses" that do not have the smaller 
  diameter step. The standard is about 10 ounces, but glasses up to 16 ounce 
  are available. There is also the famous Libby's Margarita glass (12oz and 
  16oz) with a clear bowl and green cactus stem. 
  <br class=cll></li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Sweeteners:</h3> &nbsp; Many Margarita formulas and mixers include 
  sweeteners. This is generally to cover for inferior ingredients. One guy 
  who wouldn't think of drinking a sweetened Margarita does say that a sugar 
  addicted friend is delighted if he adds a 1/2 teaspoon of rock candy syrup. 
  Personally, I'd favor Agave Nectar, seems more appropriate.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; There are many claims and stories for the origin of 
  the Margarita, and many ladies involved, but these few things cannot be 
  denied:
  <ul>
  <li>The Daisy is a drink from before 1896, made from Brandy, Citrus Juice 
    and Orange Liqueur. The "Daisy" was popular in Mexico, probably by the 
    1920s. By the 1930s the Daisy was also being made with Whisky, Gin and 
    other alcoholic beverages.</li>
  <li>"Margarita" is "Daisy" in Spanish. Make the Daisy Mexican by using 
    Tequila, then call it "Daisy" in Spanish - not much of a stretch here, 
    and no lady required.</li>
  <li>The 1937 <i>Caf&eacute; Royal Cocktail Book</i> from London, England, 
    includes a recipe for a "Picador", a Tequila cocktail made exactly as a 
    classic Margarita except for the salt on the rim. Iowa newspaper editor 
    James Graham found such a drink in Tijuana in 1936. These predate 
    <u>all</u> the origin stories. When the salted rim was added is unknown, 
    but probably before 1940.</li>
  <li>Reliable witnesses have reported enjoying Margaritas at Hussong's 
    Cantina in Ensenada in 1940/1941, just before WWII. This is well before 
    Carlos (Danny) Herrera claims he created it for former Ziegfeld dancer 
    Marjorie King in 1947/1948.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Many, many years ago, when I was dating the Apache 
  Princess (actually half Apache and half Aztec), I offered to make her a 
  Margarita by the original formula. Her reply was, "Oh no you don't! I know 
  better than to drink that!"</li>
