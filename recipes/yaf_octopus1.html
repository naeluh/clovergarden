This popular appetizer can be served warm or room temperature and takes 
rewarming well. The photo example was made with small octopi and tiny 
octopi cooked separately (see <a href="yaf_octopus1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).

<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min to 2-1/4 hrs - 20 min work)
<ol>
  <li>Rinse <b>OCTOPUS</b> and drain. Bring a deep pot of water to a boil 
    and put in it 1/2 an Onion and a couple wine corks. For details see 
    <a href="../ingred/sf_octolgz.html"><b>Cooking Large Octopi</b></a> 
    for explanation and cooking details).</li>
  <li>Drop in the octopus and bring back to a boil. Your 3-1/2 pound 
    octopus will curl up, stiffen and shrink to about 1-1/2 pound within 
    a couple of minutes. Bring back to a boil, cover and simmer over 
    medium heat until tender. This will take 1-1/2 to 2 hours depending 
    on octopus size and whether you want to rub off the skin and sucker 
    disks or not. If you used two smaller octopi check at 1-1/4 hours. 
    Octopus is done when a thin skewer goes through the thickest part 
    of a tentacle without encountering rubbery resistance.</li>
  <li>Small <b>OCTOPUS</b> is cooked much differently, and really small 
    ones can be included whole. For details see 
    <a href="../ingred/sf_octosmz.html"><b>Cooking Small Octopi</b></a>.
    </li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Make the dressing (see <a href="yaf_octopus1.html#02">
    <b>Note-2</b></a>). Chop <b>GARLIC</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> very fine. 
    Mix with <b>Olive Oil</b>, 
    <b>Lemon Juice</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>When <b>Octopus</b> is done, cut the tentacles into pieces the size 
    you want, generally 1/2" long at the big end and increasing as the 
    tentacle gets narrower.  Mix thoroughly with the dressing while still 
    warm.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Octopus:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for a single cleaned 
  octopus. You could use a couple smaller octopi cooking a little less, 
  or a bunch of much smaller octopi. For details see 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_octosmz.html"><b>Cooking Small Octopi</b></a> for 
  instructions. Don't try to cook several sizes together. The photo shows 
  a medley of tiny octopi, small tentacles, large tentacle pieces and 
  large tentacle pieces with the skin and sucker disks wiped off.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dressing:</h3> &nbsp; The amount listed is sufficient for 
  a 3-1/2 pound octopus with skin and sucker disks on. If you cook it 
  longer and rub off the skin and sucker disks cut the amounts by 1/3.
