This dish can be used as a side dish, antipasto, or as a sandwich 
filling. It is sure to be liked by tripe lovers, but many people 
will refuse to taste it.

<p>Cooking time is long, but work time is short. It'll keep in the 
fridge for 5 days or more.</p>

 <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (5hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>TRIPE</b> in a large pot with plenty of water to cover 
    well. Bring to a boil and dump out into a clean sink. Repeat once 
    more.</li>
  <li>Return <b>Tripe</b> to the pot with plenty of water to cover. Add 
    1/4 cup <b>Salt</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender. 
    Probably about 3-1/4 hours for honeycomb tripe, up to 4 hrs for 
    blanket tripe - but it can be a lot less depending on the process 
    the Tripe has been prepared by. Sample for doneness.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin. Chop <b>HERB</b> 
    quite small. Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b>.</li>
  <li>When <b>Tripe</b> is tender, cool until you can handle it, then cut 
    into 1/2 inch wide strips by whatever length you like.</li>
  <li>Tumble <b>Tripe </b> with <b>Marinade</b>. Chill in the fridge for 
    at least 2 hours, or better, overnight. I do this sealed in a plstic 
    bag.</li>
  <li>Drain well and serve chilled, garnished with the Herb used in 
    the marinade.</li> 
  </ol></td>

  <h3>Tripe:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Honeycomb Tripe, 
  but the photo example was made with Blanket Tripe, because that's 
  what the market had that day. I'm fine with Blanket. For details see 
  our <a href="../ingred/ab_tripez.html"><b>Beef Tripe</b></a> page.
