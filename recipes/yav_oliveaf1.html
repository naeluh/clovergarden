<p>This recipe is my compilation from several Italian recipes. Some 
recipes use fennel seeds as part of the flavorings, some don't have 
peperoncini but sprinkle the finished dish with balsamic vinegar.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 500&deg;F/260&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Cut zest from <b>ORANGE</b> and <b>LEMON</b> in wide strips (use 
    a vegetable peeler) taking as little white as possible.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> flat so it splits up.</li> 
  <li>Mix <b>All items</b> together and spread in a shallow baking dish 
    large enough so the olives are pretty much in a single layer.</li>
  <li>Slip into the oven and bake until olives are sizzeling well. There 
    should be noticeable browning of the exposed Garlic and Orange Zest 
    and the Olives should be wrinkled and starting to get brown spots 
    (they will be getting browner at the bottom). Don't brown too much 
    or the olives can become bitter, but don't under-bake either or the 
    olives will have a disappointing flavor (but look prettier). The 
    photo example is dyed a bit red by the red Cerignolas.</li>   
  <li>Serve warm as an appetizer.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These must be with the 
  pits in. The photo uses a mix of Kalamata, Bella di Cerignola (green 
  and red), and large Mediterranean style brine cured green olives, all 
  in equal amounts. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Peperoncini:</h3> &nbsp; These are the standard 
  Greek or Italian pickled peppers - the Greek are reputed to be 
  sweeter. Put them in without draining - the vinegar inside them will 
  help flavor the recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; This is up to you - there is no standard. 
  Thyme, bay leaves, rosemary, oregano, are all used. Don't be shy on 
  the quantity, except a little caution with rosemary. Whole sprigs are 
  commonly used which makes it easy to remove them before serving. Fennel 
  seeds are sometimes included.</li>
