This pickle, formerly used (with more vinegar) to preserve vegetables for 
winter, is now popular as an antipasto, condiment, and salad ingredient.

<p>This pickle is easy to make and far superior to the pickled vegetables 
you buy in Italian markets. Use the best wine vinegar you can get.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 Days - 50 min work) <br>The 
  timing says "50 minutes work", which is true, but the recipe will 
  actually hold you for 1-1/4 hours - use the time waiting for things 
  to boil for clean-up.
  <ol>
  <li>Bring some <b>Water</b> to a boil and boil the <b>ONIONS</b> for 
    1 minute. Scoop out into cold water. Trim the top and peel off the 
    skin layer. Cut as little as possible from the root end so they 
    hold together well.</li>
  <li>Break <b>CAULIFLOWER</b> into medium size florets, cutting away 
    thick stems.</li>
  <li>Core <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> and cut into 1/2 inch wide strips, up to 
    3 inches long, or as desired. mix with Cauliflower.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>BASIL</b> small for the Pickle.</li>
  <li>In a non reactive pot of at least 4 quarts, mix all <b>Pickle 
    Items</b>. Bring to a boil for about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Onions</b> and bring back to a boil for about 5 
    minutes or until just cooked through. Scoop out with a slotted 
    skimmer and set aside (see <a href="yav_vegpkl1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Bring the pickle back to a boil. Stir in <b>Cauliflower Mix</b> 
    and quickly return to a boil over high heat. Hold at a boil for 
    just 2-1/2 minutes. Scoop out with a slotted skimmer and mix with 
    the <b>Onions</b>.</li>
  <li>Pack the <b>Vegetables</b> into a heat resistant jar. I use a 
    half gallon kimchee jar, but two quart jars could be used.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Pickle</b> back to a boil for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Take the <b>Pickle</b> off the heat and pour in <b>Balsamic 
    Vinegar</b>. Pour over the <b>Vegetables</b> in the jar. Make sure 
    the Vegies are completely covered by the Pickle, and screw down the 
    lid loosely. Let cool to room temperature, then turn the lid down 
    tight and refrigerate for about 3 days. It will keep refrigerated 
    for at least 3 weeks.
    </li>
  <li>Serve cool as an antipasto or as a condiment, or in salads.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Tiny Onions:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for "pearl 
  onions", but I use very small boiling onions which are 1-1/4 inches 
  diameter or a little less. They take boiling for 6 minutes to cook 
  through.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cauliflower:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for trimmed florets, as we 
  have no way to predict how stemmy your head of Cauliflower is.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Balsamic Vinegar</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good quality 
  "industrial" balsamic. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/so_balsamz.html"><b>Balsamic Vinegar</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Slotted Skimmer:</h3> &nbsp; You need one of these - yes, need. 
  Once you have one you will probably never use a slotted spoon again 
  for the rest of your life. For details see our 
  <a href="../ke/ke_slotspn1.html"><b>Slotted Spoons</b></a> page.</li>
