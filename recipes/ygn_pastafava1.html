  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 30 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>If the <b>FETA</b> is very salty (such as brine packed Bulgarian), 
    soak it in cold water for an hour or so, then drain well.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Whip together <b>Feta</b>, <b>Olive Oil</b>, <b>Lemon Juice</b> and 
    <b>Black Pepper</b> (a mini-prep food processor is great for this).
    </li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small. Drain.</li>
  <li>Shell the <b>FAVAS</b>. Simmer in salted water to cover until 
    tender - about 6 minutes. Drain and cool - you don't need to peel the 
    favas unless you want to be particularly fussy.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Chop <b>MINT</b> small. 
    Mix together with <b>Olive Oil</b>, <b>Tomatoes</b> and <b>Favas</b>. 
    Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Keep in mind 
    there's more salt and pepper in the whipped feta, so don't overdo it. 
    Set aside for an hour or so at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook <b>PASTA</b> 
    the usual way until just tender (see <a href="ygn_pastafava1.html#04">Note-4</a>). 
    Drain, return to the pot and mix with a few drops of Olive Oil to keep 
    it from sticking together.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, put a layer of <b>Pasta</b> in each dish, spoon 
    over a portion of the <b>Tomato Mix</b> and add a big dollop of the 
    <b>Whipped Feta</b> off to one side for each person to incorporate as 
    s/he sees fit.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; The whipped feta part can be made a day 
ahead or more and is best given some rest time. The dressing section 
should be made an hour or so ahead or can be made a few hours ahead and 
refrigerated. Let it come to room temperature before using. The pasta 
tastes best if made just before serving, but it can be made ahead too if 
need be.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Favas:</h3> &nbsp; You'll need about 1-1/2 pound of pods to end up 
  with 1/2 pound of beans. If you can't get fresh you can use peeled 
  frozen.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pasta</h3> &nbsp; Penne, Cut Ziti or similar are appropriate.</li>
<li id ="04">
  <h3>Cooking Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; Italians like their pasta <i>al 
  dente</i>, which to them is quite firm in the center. Greeks and Turks 
  like theirs cooked tender right through (but not mushy). Americans 
  like their <i>al dente</i> right in between, which is how I always 
  cook the pasta.</li>
