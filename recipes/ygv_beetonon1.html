A fine vegetable salad for anyone who likes beets (all right thinking 
folks), with onions to give it a more complex flavor. This salad can be 
made a couple of days ahead of need.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ hrs - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>If <b>BEETS</b> have tops, cut so there is about an inch 
    of stem left. Place them in a pot with water to cover, bring to a 
    boil and simmer until a sharp skewer will pass through the largest 
    one without hitting a hard spot in the middle, about 25 minutes 
    depending on size. Drain.</li>
  <li>As soon as the <b>Beets</b> are cool enough to handle, rub off 
    the skins and stems (it's harder to do when they get cool).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beets</b> in quarters lengthwise if large, then crosswise 
    about 1/4 inch thick. Alternately you can cut the beets into 
    juliennes so they better match the onions in shape. Arrange in a 
    non-reactive bowl.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Toss 
    in with Beets.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Break <b>Bay Leaves</b> in half. 
    Mix all <b>Dressing items</b>. Pour over the salad and toss.</li>
  <li>Give it a couple hours rest time if you can, turning a couple of 
    times, or refrigerated overnight. Serve lightly chilled or just 
    cool.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
<h3>Beets:</h3> &nbsp; Small beets are sweeter and more tender than 
  larger beets. Beets with greens are best. They are more expensive, 
  but you can use the tops for delicious <a href="yjd_pstbeet1.html">
  <b>Beet Green Pesto</b></a> and <a href="ygv_beetstm1.html">
  <b>Marinaded Beet Stems</b></a>. At worst the beets should be "tail 
  on" and have some wilted stubble from their stems. Storage beets, 
  cut flush at both ends, are generally suitable for compost, but not 
  much else.</li>
