This salad, of both raw and cooked ingredients, is more a project than 
most salads, but is very good for parties. Parts can be made well ahead 
and mixed together just before serving - see <a href="ygv_salisabl1.html#05">

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ hrs - 1-1/4 hrs work)
  <ol>
  <li>Steam the <b>RICE</b> with just enough water to cook it through. 
    The grains should still be quite separate. Fluff the rice gently, 
    chill well, preferably overnight. See <a href="ygv_salisabl1.html#05">
    <b>Note-5</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>EGGPLANT</b> into pieces about 3/8 inch on a side. Tumble 
    with salt and let sit for at least 1/2 hour, tossing now and then.
    </li>
  <li>Slice <b>ZUCCHINI</b> about 3/8 inch thick. If over 1-1/2 inch 
    diameter cut slices in half. 
  <li>Thaw <b>LIMA BEANS</b>.</li>
  <li>Char the skin of the <b>BELL PEPPER</b> using your propane 
    torch. Brush the skin off under running water. Cut into strips about 
    3/8 inch wide and 1 inch long.</li>   
  <li>Slice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 3/8 inch thick, and cut the slices into 
    quarters, or however you like.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>CUCUMBERS</b> about 1/4 inch thick. If you have only 
    standard green blimps you'll have to peel them, cut them in half 
    lengthwise and seed them before slicing.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>BASIL</b> and <b>OREGANO</b> small.</li>
  <li>Steam <b>Lima Beans</b> and <b>Zucchini</b> until zucchini is 
    just cooked through. The seed mass should be translucent, but not 
    falling apart at all. Cool well.</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>Eggplant</b> and wring out excess moisture. Heat 1/4 c 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Eggplant</b>, stirring until quite 
    soft, but not yet turning to mush. Cool well.</li>
  <li>Assemble Salad: &nbsp; Tumble together all <b>Salad items</b> and 
    chill in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Make Dressing: &nbsp; Mash <b>GARLIC</b> well. Mix all <b>Dressing 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, place <b>Salad</b> in a bowl. Shake up 
    <b>Dressing</b> until frothy. Pour over Salad.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; Use a long grain rice that is not sticky. Thai 
  Jasmine is stickier than some, but separate enough to be usable.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Zucchini:</h3> &nbsp; These should be young, 
  narrow zucchini, not more than 1-3/4 inches at the widest part.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Lima Beans:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer the big fordhook 
  lima beans, but they can be hard to find. "Baby" limas will work OK. 
  The pattern recipe calls for fresh lima beans - good luck with that. 
  Frozen works fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Persian, Japanese, or some 
  other cucumber that doesn't need to be peeled and seeded. If you have 
  only standard green blimps you will have to peel and seed them 
  before weighing.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Party Plan:</h3> &nbsp; Cook the rice as much 
  two days ahead. Chill it well, loosely packed in a covered bowl. When 
  chilled, bag loosely, keeping in the fridge until needed - making sure 
  nothing gets set on top of it. Do the cooked items (beans, zucchini, 
  eggplant) the day before, mix, bag and refrigerate. The raw items and 
  dressing can be made hours ahead and refrigerated. When ready to serve, 
  break up any lumps in the rice, and toss everything together in a very 
  large mixing bowl (I use a shallow 15 inch stainless bowl for mixing 
  party salads). Just before serving, shake the dressing up until it is 
  frothy and pour over the salad. Toss. As tossed, it can still be 
  re-bagged and held in the fridge for a few hours.</li>
