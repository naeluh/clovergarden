This dish is very simple, easy, and surpisingly tasty. Asparagus is also 
used this way farther north in Italy, but without tomatoes, and they 
prefer intensely flavored wild asparagus.

<p>This sauce can be reheated once, if done quickly, without the 
asparagus becoming too mushy.	If making ahead, cut the simmer time 
to compensate for reheating.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut off <b>ASPARAGUS</b> tips (about 2 inches) and cut tender 
    parts of stems into segments about 2 inches long. Do not discard 
    the tough ends, but keep those ends aside, stems and tips separate. 
    You want to end up with a combined weight of tips and stems of 12 
    to 14 ounces.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, chill in cold 
    water and peel. Dice about 3/4 inch on a side.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> for garnish, if using.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Bring your salted pasta water up to a boil. Stir in the  
    <b>Tough Asparagus Ends</b>, bring back to a boil for about 20 
    minutes. Scoop out and discard the Asparagus ends - keep the 
    water hot.</li>
  <li>You can put your <b>Pasta</b> into the boiling water at this 
    point.</li>
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Asparagus Stems</b> and fry stirring for about 4 minutes. Stir in 
    <b>Asparagus Tips</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes.</li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Tomatoes</b> along with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a boil and keep covered for two minutes to 
    get the tomatoes hot, then uncover and keep at at a light boil for 
    another 8 minutes, stirring gently now and then. This will reduce the 
    amount of liquid released by the tomatoes. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>When <b>Pasta</b> is <i>al dente</i>, drain. Return it to the 
    (now empty) pot and stir in a tiny bit of Olive Oil to keep it 
    from sticking. You could also do this "Italian style" by simply 
    mixing in the <b>Sauce</b>. This is one of the few pasta recipes I 
    like to serve "Italian style".</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with <b>Grated Cheese</b> on the side - or not, 
    as you wish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asparagus:</h3> &nbsp; Use smaller diameter 
  Asparagus with a decent length of tender stem.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; It is more important than 
  in most recipes to use "Roma" type tomatoes as they release a lot less 
  liquid. Time to reduce the amount of liquid is very short in this 
  recipe. </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Note that I have reduced 
  the amount of oil from 1/2 cup in the pattern recipe to 1/4 cup. Feel 
  free to increase the amount a bit if you prefer.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; In Umbria they commonly use 
  Orecchiette, but I think the Casaricci shown in the photo better 
  matches the shape of the asparagus. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_itals.html"><b>Italian Short Pasta Shapes</b></a> 
  page. Feel free to use whatever shape you like.</li>
