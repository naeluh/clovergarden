This delicious recipe is clearly derived from 
<a href="yhn_pstgri1.html"><b>Pasta alla Gricia</b></a>, from before 
Tomatoes came to Italy. This recipe can be six Pasta Plates,

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (22 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Slice <b>GUANCIALE</b> 1/8 inch thick and cut into short rectangles.
    </li>
  <li>Grate 1/2 cup <b>PECORINO</b>, and grate more for serving.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> small. Keep an appropriate amount of the 
    juice with them.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Place a 2 cup measure under your pasta strainer in the sink so 
    you won't forget to save some pasta water.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1 teaspoon <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    and fry <b>Guanciale</b> until crispy around the edges. Remove it 
    from the pan, but leave the fat and fond.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1 Tablespoon <b>Olive Oil</b>, <b>Onions</b> and 
    <b>Chili Flake</b>. Fry stirring until onions are translucent, no 
    browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>White Wine</b> for a minute, then <b>Tomatoes</b> 
    and <b>Guanciale</b>. Cook uncovered over moderately high heat for 
    about 15 minutes, stirring now and then. Most of the water should 
    have evaporated.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Cook <b>BUCATINI</b> in salted water the usual 
    way. I break Bucatini and Spaghetti in half to make it more 
    manageable. Cook just shy of done al dente. Strain, <u>reserving 
    some water</u>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Bucatini</b>, and just a little of the <b>Pasta 
    Water</b> to loosen the sauce a bit, but not too much.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle over <b>Pecorino</b> in batches and tumble until the 
    Cheese has melded with the sauce and the Pasta is done al dente. 
    Add a little more Pasta Water as needed. <u>Don't over-stir</u> 
    or the cheese will lump. If your cheese is not sufficiently 
    incorporated and is stringy, it will help to add a little more of 
    the Pasta Water, cover, and steam over moderate heat for a short 
    time without stirring. The recipe should finish without free 
    water in the pan.</li>
  <li>Serve hot and pass <b>Pecorino</b> for sprinkling. A big Red Wine 
    us usually served with this dish.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Guanciale:</h3> &nbsp; This is a bacon made from 
  pork cheeks. It is imperfectly available in North America, so most 
  recipes call for Pancetta. Cooks Illustrated found American Salt Pork 
  is a more accurate substitute - Guanciale is fattier than Pancetta. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/ap_pigp.html">
  <b>Pork Products</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bucatini:</h3> &nbsp; This pasta is like a large 
  spaghetti, but hollow in the center. It is the traditional pasta for 
  this dish in Rome, but at its origin in Amatrice, Spaghetti is used. 
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pecorino Romano:</h3> &nbsp; This Sheep Milk 
  Cheese, aged for grating, is very available in North America. Zerto 
  is a popular brand. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/da_cheesev.html#it"><b>Cheese Varieties</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomatoes, Canned:</h3> &nbsp; All recipes call 
  for Canned Tomatoes, but vary quite a bit on how much. Be sure to 
  include an amount of the juice from the can proportional to the 
  amount of tomatoes. Just about all recipes demand San Marzano tomatoes, 
  but California Central Valley tomatoes have won every blind tasting 
  against the Italians by a wide margin. Trader Joe's are often at the 
  top.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili Flake:</h3> &nbsp; All recipes include at 
  least a pinch of chili flake. I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, 
  which are fairly hot, but in this quantity it's barely noticeable. 
  Use your own best judgment and preferred flake.</li>
