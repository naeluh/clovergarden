<p>This recipe can be four Pasta Plates, or a Main Dish for two. It is 
substantial and stays with you.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (7 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Grate <b>PECORINO</b> fairly small. Measure is about 1-1/2 cups 
    lightly packed.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Place a 2 cup measure under your pasta strainer in the sink so 
    you won't forget to save some pasta water.</li>
  <li>Cook Pasta in boiling salted Water the usual way, but just very 
    slightly under-done. For Spaghetti, I break it in half to make it 
    more manageable.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat 
    <b>Oil</b> and stir in <b>Pepper</b>. Stir for a couple minutes to 
    blend flavor, but don't let the oil get too hot.</li>
  <li>Strain <b>Pasta</b>, <u>reserving some water</u>. Pour the Pasta 
    in the pan and stir until well coated with the oil. Take off the heat 
    to cool a little so the Pecorino won't lump immediately when 
    sprinkled on.</li>
  <li>Place 2 T <b>Pasta Water</b> in the pan and Sprinkle over 
    <b>Pecorino</b> in batches and tumble until the Cheese has melded 
    with the sauce and the Pasta is done al dente. Add a little more 
    Pasta Water as needed. <u>Don't over-stir</u> or the cheese will 
    lump. If your cheese is not sufficiently incorporated and is 
    stringy, it will help to add a little more of the Pasta Water, 
    cover, and steam over moderate heat for a short time without 
    stirring. The recipe should finish without free water in the 
    pan.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately.</li>
