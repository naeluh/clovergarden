  <b><u>Prep</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Snap tough base ends off from <b>Asparagus</b>. Cut each into three 
    sections, keeping the sections separate. First cut 2 inches of the 
    tip, then the next two inches. Finally another 2 inches. You may have 
    some random end pieces left over - combine them with the third 
    section.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of <b>Water</b> to a rapid boil over high heat. Put 
    the <b>Asparagus</b> base group into the water and cook for 1-1/2 
    minutes. Then put in the center group and cook another 1 minute. 
    Finally put in the tips and cook until just tender, about 4 minutes 
    depending on thickness. Drain, refresh in cold water, drain again 
    and hold until needed.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>PARMESAN</b> very fine and mix thoroughly with 
    <b>MASCARPONE</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Check <b>HAZLENUTS</b> for rancidity. Roast them (if not already 
    roasted) and crush coarsely, chop <b>CHIVES</b> medium, shave 
    <b>PARMESAN</b> (use a vegetable peeler) and cut shavings diagonally if 
    large. Mix all for use as a topping.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Set out your strainer for the pasta. Place a heat proof cup under 
    the strainer so you won't forget to reserve some pasta water.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook your <b>Pasta</b> the 
    usual way until just <a href="yhn_pastaaspara1.html#04"><b>"Al Dente"</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Asparagus</b> just long enough to warm it up well, then 
    pour the pasta into the strainer, catching at least 1/2 cup of the pasta 
    water.</li>
  <li>Return Pasta to the pot and stir in just a tad of <b>Olive Oil</b> to 
    keep it from sticking. Stir in the <b>Cheese mix</b>  and just enough of 
    the reserved pasta water to make it of a sauce consistency.</li>
  <li>Portion pasta out onto individual plates and garnish with a dollop of 
    the <b>Hazelnut topping</b>.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Asparagus:</h3> &nbsp; Medium size asparagus around 
  1/2 inch diameter at the bottom is good for this recipe, but other sizes 
  can be used. If it is much larger you'll probably have to use a 
  vegetable peeler on the bottom half. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/li_aspara.html"><b>Asparagus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; The photo example uses 
  Farfalla, the "bow-tie" pasta, which is ideal for this recipe. If 
  you substitute, use a similarly simple pasta that won't grab too much 
  of the cheese sauce.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mascarpone:</h3> &nbsp; This is a light Italian 
  cream cheese. Other light cream cheeses can be substituted.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Al Dente:</h3> &nbsp; Pasta is to be cooked "al dente" (to the tooth), 
  but opinions vary. Italians insist it must resist the bite in the center. 
  Greeks and Turks like it uniform all the way though, but not at all mushy. 
  Personally, I prefer it just a shade more even than the Italians, but 
  firmer than the Greeks. Most Americans badly overcook pasta, and that will 
  happen if you use the time on the package. There is no substitute for 
  sampling.</li>
