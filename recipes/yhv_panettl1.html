Nettles are popular in Italy, as a green color in pasta and as an 
ingredient in pasta sauces. This recipe can be two generous light main 
dishes, or four pasta courses.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>NETTLES</b> like you would spinach. Wearing rubber 
    gloves if your skin is tender, discard tough stems (those turning dark).
    </li> 
  <li>Bring plenty of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in <b>Nettles</b> 
    and simmer for about 5 minutes. Drain well.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>LEMON</b> for zest (yellow only). Squeeze for juice. Keep 
    separate.</li>
  <li>Chop together very fine: <b>Nettles</b>, <b>MINT</b>, <b>PARSLEY</b>,  
    <b>CHIVES</b> and <b>Lemon Zest</b>     (See <a href="yhv_panettl1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>).</li> 
  <li>Chop in <b>Ricotta</b> until evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>Whip in <b>Olive Oil</b> until smooth, then stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>. 
    </li>
  <li>Cut or tear <b>Sorrel</b> into narrow strips.</li> 
  <li>Break <b>Walnuts</b> into medium size pieces and (optionally) 
    toast them lightly in a dry pan.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol start="9">
  <li>Place <b>Nettle mix</b> In a saut&eacute; pan or saucepan and hold 
    until needed.</li> 
  <li>Cook <b>Pasta</b> in plenty of salted water the usual way. When just 
    done, drain (but not too dry) and return to the pan. If you need to hold 
    it at all, mix with a few 
    drops of <b>Olive Oil</b> to keep it from sticking together.</li>
  <li>When Pasta is nearly done, turn up heat under the sauce. Cook stirring 
    until hot, but do not boil. Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and 
    <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Sorrel</b> and <b>Walnuts</b> into <b>Pasta</b>.</li>  
  <li>With tongs, load <b>Pasta</b> onto individual plates (preferably 
    warm ones). Ladle sauce over. Serve immediately. See 
    <a href="yhv_panettl1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for variations.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Nettles:</b> &nbsp; These should be tender tops of young nettles. 
  If you live in a region with humidity and streams you may be able to 
  cut them yourself (wear gloves - they sting). Here in Southern 
  California they can sometimes be obtained from herb growers at local 
  Farmer's Markets. Incidentally, they are much more likely to sting 
  when you brush against them lightly than when you handle them firmly. 
  For details see our <a href="../ingred/od_nettlz.html">
  <b>Nettles</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sorrel:</h3> &nbsp; These leaves look like Spinach 
  and taste exactly like the clover shaped Wood Sorrel that probably 
  infests your garden. You can use that if you have enough of it. If 
  you have neither, spinach leaves can be substituted.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer Linguini, but any stringy 
  pasta can be used, or non-stringy if you prefer.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I do this all on the cutting board (except the 
  Olive Oil part), first chopping the herbs together fine, then chopping 
  in the Ricotta, but you can use a food processor. The results will have 
  less texture but it will be faster (a bit less faster if you count 
  getting the processor out, cleaning it after use and putting it away). 
  If you do use a processor, slowly pour in the Olive Oil to blend 
  while it is running.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Alternatively, you can stir 
  sauce, walnuts and sorrel into the pot of pasta and serve it pre-sauced. 
  If you sprinkle the sorrel over servings as a garnish it will stay 
  greener.</li>
