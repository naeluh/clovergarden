A very dry and intensely flavorful filling for small fresh pastas - 
sufficient to fill fresh pasta forms such as cappelletti made from 4 
cups of flour. It can be made well ahead up to mixing in the egg, and 
refrigerated, or frozen.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into  about 3/4 inch cubes. Fry gently in 1/2 T 
    <b>Butter</b> until raw color is gone. There should be no browning. 
    Drain and let cool.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into about 3/4 inch cubes. Fry gently in 1/2 T 
    <b>Butter</b> for 2 to 3 minutes until no longer raw. There should be 
    no browning.  Drain and let cool.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PANCETTA</b> and <b>SALAME</b> very fine. Traditionally 
    It's done with a knife for best texture. If you use a mini-prep 
    processor do them separately as they chop very differently. They must 
    be chopped very fine, but not to mush.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>PARMESAN</b> on the fine side of your grater. If chopping 
    with a knife, mix with the other ingredients. If using the mini-prep, 
    run it separately.</li>
  <li>When cool, combine <b>Pork</b> and <b>Chicken</b> and chop quite 
    fine, but not until they become a paste. Again, it's traditionally 
    done by hand with a knife for best texture. If you use the mini-prep, 
    run them separately. If I used a knife, I finish by chopping 
    everything but the egg together until uniformly mixed.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>All Items</b> together. It's best to do this by 
    hand for even texture and distribution.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without any fat or membranes. Cut 
  doesn't matter much.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  breast, but I use thigh meat which has better flavor. Weight is 
  with all skin and fat removed.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Pancetta:</h3> &nbsp; This is Italian salt pork 
  made up into a roll. Regular salt pork can be used if you can't get 
  it.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Salami</h3> &nbsp; This needs to be a dry 
  salami. The pattern recipe calls for Soppressata as a substitute for 
  the unavailable local salami insisted on by the recipe's originator. 
  OK, I confess, I've used a Hungarian dry salami and it worked fine.
