  <b><u>PREP</u></b>
  <br>A mini-prep food processor is perfect for the whole job, but you can 
    grind in a large mortar and whip by hand as was done traditionally.
  <ol>
  <li>Set your <b>EGG</b> out long enough to come to room temperature. 
    Separate the yolk from the white (use the white for something else).</li>
  <li>Zest your <b>LEMON</b> (yellow only) and squeeze it for the juice (a 
    good lemon will get you the whole 1/4 cup).</li>
  <li>Chop / grind together to a paste the <b>GARLIC</b>, <b>Egg Yolk</b> 
    and <b>SALT</b>, then blend in <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Whipping continuously, slowly dribble in the <b>OLIVE OIL</b> until 
    evenly incorporated.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Lemon Zest</b> and <b>PEPPER</b> - white pepper for no 
    tiny black specks or black for best flavor.</li>
  <li>Spoon over Asparagus or whatever else you have in mind. This dressing 
    can be kept refrigerated 1 day.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Raw Egg:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe uses raw egg yolk. The danger in 
  this is controversial and rgional. For details see our section on 
  <a href="../ingred/da_eggs.html#safe"><b>Egg Safety</b></a>. While, 
  here in "over-regulated" Southern California, infections from home 
  cooking have been pretty much non-existant, this is not true in 
  "business friendly" Red States. In any case, infants, the very elderly 
  and people with impaired immune systems should avoid raw or soft cooked 
  egg recipes (which would include all properly made omelets). Always use 
  only eggs that have been continuously refrigerated from farm to you, and 
  have no cracks in the shell - and observe proper handling percautions.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Alternative:</h3> &nbsp; If the raw egg yolk is a problem for you, 
  you can fake this up by replacing the oil and egg yolk with a little 
  over 3/4 cup of commercial mayonnaise, adding lemon juice to taste (as 
  it will already be a bit tart from vinegar) and the other ingredients. 
  For the purposes of this Web site, "commercial mayonnaise" means 
  Hellmann's Real (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods Real (west of 
  the Mississippi).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olive Oil:</h3> &nbsp; A light flavored Extra Virgin can be used, 
  or Pure Olive Oil (lighter flavor) or a mix of the two depending on 
  taste.</li>
