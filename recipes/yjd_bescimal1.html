This Italian sauce, formerly called <i>Balsamella</i>, was adopted by 
the French under the name <i>B&eacute;chamel</i>. There is disagreement 
as to how to keep it from getting lumps, see <a href="yjd_bescimal1.html#01">
<b>Note-1</b></a>, and see <a href="yjd_bescimal1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a> on thickness

  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> over moderate heat in a heavy bottomed saucepan. 
    Stir in <b>Flour</b> and cook stirring constantly for a couple of 
    minutes until the flour is a light blonde color (no browing at all) 
    and no longer smells raw. This is called a "blonde roux".</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and stir in the chilled <b>Milk</b> all at once. 
    Return to the heat and stir constantly until the sauce thickens 
    and becomes smooth, about 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b>, <b>White Pepper</b> and Nutmeg.</li>
  <li>If you need to hold the sauce, cover the surface with plastic 
    film, or otherwise protect it from air. It can be refrigerated 
    overnight - reheat very slowly with plenty of stirring.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes tell you to heat 
  the milk to a simmer, then stir it into the roux starting with fractions 
  of a teaspoon and adding slowly increasing amounts until it is all 
  stirred in. Mapie, Countess de Toulouse-Lautrec, says you will be much 
  more successful stirring chilled milk into the hot roux all at once. 
  Alma Lach concurrs. These are two of the formost experts in the French 
  cuisine, and it works for me, so I give that method here. If you do 
  get any lumps, strain them out.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Thickness:</h3> &nbsp; This sauce can be made a 
  little thicker by using a bit more flour, but also add a little 
  butter as the weight of flour must not exceed the weight of butter. 
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; In Provence, France, Olive 
  Oil may be used in place of the butter.</li>
