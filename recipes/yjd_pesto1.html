A classic Italian sauce for pasta and vegetables - wonderfully tasty. 
In Italy, pestos are also made with other greens, see our delicious 
<a href="yjd_pstbeet1.html"><b>Beet Greens Pesto</b></a>.  See also 
<a href="yjd_pesto1.html#04"><b>Serving</b></a>.

Fortunately, modern machinery makes it possible to create pestos in your 
own home without a massive marble mortar and arms that could twist the 
turret off an Abrams tank.

  <br>A mini-prep food processor is perfect for this.
  <ol>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> on the fine side of a box grater.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium.</li>
  <li>Wash  <b>BASIL</b> and removed leaves from stems.</li>
  <li>Put <b>Cheese</b> and <b>Pine Nuts</b> in the food processor and 
   chop/grind very fine.</li>
  <li>Add the <b>Garlic</b> and chop/grind some more. Add the <b>Basil</b>.
    At this point you'll have to start adding <b>Olive Oil</b> because the 
    Garlic really gums up the works.  Chop/grind as fine as you can 
    reasonably get it.</li>
  <li>Jar it immediately working out any air bubbles, top with a layer of 
    olive oil to seal it from the air (or it will turn 
    dark in a matter of minutes) and refrigerate. Use within a few days. 
    Of course you can freeze it. I freeze it as a long flat bar so I can 
    just whack off the amount I need and leave the rest frozen.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pine Nuts:</h3> &nbsp; "Purists" will have Pine 
  Nuts and only Pine Nuts, but in Italy (pine nuts are expensive there 
  too) raw hazelnuts, almonds and even walnuts are also used. I have used 
  raw pistachios successfully when pine nuts were not on hand (similarly 
  resinous). For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cf_pinez.html"><b>Pine Page</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is grated fairly fine. Romano and other 
  hard aged cheeses are also used, and sometimes blends of two. Buy a 
  fresh block, <u>never</u> pre-grated. You want the flavor of good 
  cheese, not dry sawdust.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Basil:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is firmly packed, but not really hard 
  packed. Fresh sweet basil is available in vast quantity in Italy, but 
  around here it's in tiny packages at way too high a price - and the 
  fusarium wilt makes it harder to grow your own now. Fortunately, here 
  in Los Angeles, Thai basil is in excellent supply, and 2013 US $2 at 
  the local farmer's market fetches enough for this recipe. Yes the 
  flavor is a little different, but it's still plenty fine. If you use 
  Thai basil, use the purple stemmed variety. The pale green lemon basil 
  often sold as "Thai basil" is too mild, and the flavor is too far 
  from Italian basil. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/mt_basil.html"><b>Basils</b></a>  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving;</h3> &nbsp; This is one sauce that, when serving 
  with pasta, I serve it Italian style - sauce mixed with pasta in the pot. 
  Don't drown the pasta in sauce, just enough to coat lightly. This sauce 
  is very appropriate (and traditional) with Linguini.</li>
