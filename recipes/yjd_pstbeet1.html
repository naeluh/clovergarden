A delicious pesto made of the greens from those bunches of fresh beets 
you bought. It can be used in any way Italian basil pesto is used, and 
it's way cheaper.

<p>Yes, Italians do make pestos from greens other than basil (parsley, 
for instance), and do use nuts other than pine nuts (raw almonds, raw 
pistachios, etc.).</p>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 day - 20 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Float wash <b>BEET TOPS</b> same as with Spinach. Tear the 
    green leaf part off the stems and heavy ribs. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. 
    Grate <b>PARMESAN</b>. Strip leaves from <b>ROSEMARY</b>, discarding 
    the hard stem. Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. Mix <b>All Items</b> 
    in a food processor bowl. </li>
  <li>Run in the Food Processor with the sharp metal blade until you have 
    the texture about as fine as it will get. If it seems a little too 
    dry, cautiously add more Olive Oil.</li>
  <li>This pesto will keep a few days in the fridge. Freeze for longer 
    storage</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beet Greens:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing 
  stems and heavy ribs. Two bunches of medium size fresh beets yielded 
  6 ounces of greens after removing stems - your mileage may vary. 
  The stems can be used for 
  <a href="ygv_beetstm1.html"><b>Marinated Beet Stems</b></a>, a very 
  fine salad.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; Measure is grated fairly fine. 
  Romano and other hard aged cheeses can also be used. Buy a fresh wedge, 
  <u>never</u> pre-grated. You want the flavor of good cheese, not dry 
  sawdust.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>California:</h3> &nbsp; This state has a very strong Italian 
  heritage, to the point the Bank of America was originally the Bank of 
  Italy, and Zucchini was first popularized in Los Angeles. We make no 
  apologies for offering California dishes "in the Italian style".</li>
