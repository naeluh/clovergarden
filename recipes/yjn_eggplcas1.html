From Ristorante Cassaletto near Rome, this sauce is delicious. Softly 
chunky, it goes well with short pasta shapes - shown here with an 
unusually small version of Pennette.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hour - 25 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut off the stem and flower end of the unpeeled <b>EGGPLANTS</b>. 
    Slice them crosswise 1/2 inch thick. Rub the slices on both sides 
    with salt and keep in a bowl for 45 minutes to an hour, tumbling 
    now and then (see <a href="yjn_eggplcas1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Rinse <b>Eggplant</b> slices in warm water until they no longer 
    taste salty. Pat them dry and cut into dice about 1/2 inch on a 
    side depending on the texture you want.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, chill in cold 
    water and peel. Chop fairly fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Green Peppercorns</b>.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> for garnish.</li>
  <li>Tear <b>BASIL</b> into shreds. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Melt <b>Butter</b> for the Pasta, 2 T for 1 pound pasta.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Butter</b> and stir in 
    <b>Eggplant</b>. Turn heat to low, cover tightly and simmer slowly 
		for about 20 minutes. Stir every so often.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Wine</b> and simmer until mostly evaporated, then stir in 
    <b>Green Peppercorns</b>. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a saut&eacute; or sauce pan large enough for 
    the whole recipe, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> over moderate heat. Stir 
    in <b>Garlic</b> and fry stirring just until softened, no browning.
    </li> 
  <li>Stir in the <b>Tomatoes</b> and cook stirring over moderate heat 
    until most liquid has evaporated. Don't cook too dry, though, or the 
    fresh taste of the tomatoes will be lost. If using canned tomatoes, 
    you'll need to simmer longer to reduce the liquid.</li>
  <li>Combine <b>Eggplant</b> with <b>Tomatoes</b>. Season to taste with 
    <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Just before serving, drain the <b>Basil</b> and stir in.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>Pasta</b> the usual way. When done <i>al dente</i>, drain, 
    return to the pot and tumble with the <b>Melted Butter</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve warm over warm pasta, garnished with <b>Parmesan Cheese</b> 
    and more on the side (see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/06"><b>Note-6</b></a>). </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Eggplants:</h3> &nbsp; Use the small dark purple 
  Italian eggplants (or Japanese, you can hardly tell them apart, except 
  by stem color). Actually, my market was short on types of eggplant when 
  I shopped for this recipe, so I used Chinese eggplants, and they worked 
  fine. Don't use  white eggplants or the standard globe eggplants, both 
  of which have rather tough skins. See also <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/07">
  <b>Note-7</b></a>).
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; The writer of the source cookbook, as do 
  most European recipe writers, insists in all recipes on "sweet" 
  (unsalted) butter. Chefs say this allows them to better control the 
  saltiness of the dish - but then tell you to add salt "to taste". 
  I just don't have a problem with salted butter, which takes a lot 
  longer to go rancid (the purpose of the salt).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Green Peppercorns:</h3> &nbsp; the Italian chef who originated 
  this recipe insisted it is very important to use green peppercorns, 
  not black or white.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have ripe flavorful tomatoes, 
  used canned. A 28 oz can plus a 14 oz can should give you the right 
  amount. You will have to simmer down longer than for fresh tomatoes.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Salting:</h3> &nbsp; The reason always given for salting Eggplant 
  is to "drain off the bitter juices". I'm not at all convinced eggplants 
  have "bitter juices", at least not here in North America, and I've 
  eaten lots of them, raw and cooked every which ways. The salting changes 
  the cooking characteristics (they sponge up less oil), so do it anyway 
  if you're going to fry them in oil.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving</h3> &nbsp; In Italy, the pasta would be 
  tumbled with the Butter and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, then the sauce. 
  It would be served as a pasta course with additional Parmesan on the 
  side. Since I am more likely to serve it as a main course, I do it as 
  in the photo.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sex and the Eggplant:</h3> &nbsp; The source book for this recipe 
  subscribes to the absurd story that eggplants come in male and female 
  (and you should buy the male). There may actually be a difference 
  between eggplants with a "dot" flower scar and those with a "dash" 
  scar, but it has nothing to do with sex. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ns_eggplantw.html#male"><b>Working with 
  Eggplants</b></a> page.</li>
