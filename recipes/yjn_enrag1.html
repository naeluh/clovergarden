This is the sauce traditionally used in <a href="yhv_penrag1.html">
<b>Penne Enraged</b></a>, extracted for use with any pasta. It has 
<u>excellent</u> flavor and deserves frequent use. Being Italian, the 
chili part is very mild.

  <li>Trim <b>MUSHROOM</b> stems fairly short. Slice vertically about 
    1/8 inch thick.
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into small strips.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> until split open.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute, chill in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Strip <b>BASIL LEAVES</b> from stems.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>CHILI</b>.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> for garnish.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min or less, depending)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a skillet, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b>. Fry 
    <b>Bacon</b> gently until it is crisp. Remove from the Oil and 
    set aside.</li>
  <li>Fry <b>Garlic</b> in the oil until medium browned. Remove and 
    discard.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry gently until they have given up 
    most of their water but not shriveled. Return <b>Bacon</b> to the 
    skillet. Fry another 2 minutes, then take off heat.</li>
  <li>In a sauce pan, simmer <b>Tomatoes</b>, along with <b>Chili</b> and 
    <b>Basil</b> for about 15 minutes stirring often.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Mushroom mix</b> into the Tomatoes and simmer tightly 
    covered another 5 minutes or so. If needed, simmer more uncovered to 
    adjust to a sauce consistency, but don't take it to dry or you'll 
    lose the fresh taste of the tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Season to taste with <b>Salt</b> and keep hot.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook <b>Pasta</b> the 
    usual way until al dente.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Pasta, with <b>Parmesan</b> on the side 
    (see <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/05"><b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; I suppose these should 
  be Criminis, but regular white mushrooms will do, especially if 
  they've been stored in a paper bag in the fridge a few days and have 
  darkened a bit - which intensifies the flavor. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; In Italy bacon is usually not smoked, more like 
  our Salt Pork. Many Italian recipe writers recommend soaking American 
  bacon in warm water for a while to reduce the smoke and salt. 
  Personally, I don't.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; One presumes this will be one 
  of the common Japones - the Italians are wimps as far as chilis go, 
  and are easily enraged. Well, this is California, so I used one of 
  my bright orange bird chilis, considerably more enragement now, but 
  still not what I'd call "hot". Use your own best judgement. For 
  details see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional pasta for this sauce is Penne, 
  but any short shape will work just fine. If you want to use it with 
  long pasta, such as linguini, chop the Mushrooms smaller.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The Italian way of serving would be to mix 
  the sauce with the pasta, sprinkle the cheese over, toss, and serve 
  in small bowls as a pasta course. I don't serve it this way because 
  I'm not Italian. I'm usually serving "American style", as a main 
  course, and want better control of all elements, as well as 
  a more decorative appearance.</li>
