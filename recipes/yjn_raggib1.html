  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - mostly cutting giblets)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>MUSHROOMS</b> in 1 cup cold water. If any particles fall 
    to the bottom, lift the Mushrooms out and change the water until no 
    more particles fall. Do a final 1 hr soak in 1 cup hot water.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> in boiling water 1 minute, chill in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>GIZZARDS</b> and <b>HEARTS</b> into 1/4 inch dice. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PANCETTA</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b>, <b>CARROT</b>, and <b>CELERY</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, mix both with 
    <b>BAY LEAF</b> and <b>SAGE LEAVES</b>.</li>
  <li>Grate <b>CHEESE</b> for garnish.</li> 
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan or similar, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> 
    over moderate flame. Stir in <b>Pancetta</b>, then <b>Vegi mix</b>. 
    Fry over moderate heat, stirring now and then, until Onions are 
    translucent, then turn up heat a bit until you see a trace of 
    browning.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Giblets</b>. Keep over high heat until all exuded liquid 
    has evaporated, then turn to moderate and brown fairly slowly, 
    stirring with increasing frequently and scraping up fond adhering to 
    the pan. The browning should take 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Mushrooms</b> <u>reserving the liquid</u>. Chop 
    the mushrooms fine and add to the pot.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Herbs mix</b> and fry over moderate heat for about 
    2-1/2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Strain the <b>Mushroom Liquid</b> and stir it into the pot. Let 
    it fry over moderate heat for about 5 minutes, scraping up any 
    fond stuck to the pan.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Wine</b>, <b>Tomato Sauce</b>, and <b>Tomatoes</b>. 
    Allow to bubble over moderate heat until nearly all liquid has 
    evaporated.</li>    
  <li>Stir in 1 cup <b>Stock</b> and let bubble until nearly all liquid 
    has evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in remaining 2 cups <b>Stock</b> and bring up to a simmer.
    Stir in <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Simmer, stirring now and then, 
    and checking it is not too dry, until the <b>Giblets</b> are tender 
    and it is all at a sauce consistency. If the meat is still too 
    chewy for you, give the simmer another 1/2 hour .</li>
  <li><u>Note</u>: &nbsp; When there is still a fair amount of liquid, 
    I pour most it into a glass measuring cup. I let it settle for 
    a few minutes, the skim off the excess fats from the top. I return 
    it to the pan and place the pan back on the heat.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Pasta, with <b>Parmesan</b> on the side 
    (see <a href="yjn_raggib1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Porcini Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are pretty much essential to 
  Italian cooking, but can be very expensive and poor quality. I buy 
  them 8 ounces at a time from nuts.com at a more reasonable price. 
  Theirs have never needed any effort to clean out dirt and debris. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/fungus.html"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pancetta:</h3> &nbsp; This is an Italian cured but unsmoked 
  bacon. When my usual deli was unexpectedly out of it, I found a very 
  mildly smoked bacon from Poland, imported by Red Square, and it worked 
  fine.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Sage Leaf:</h3> &nbsp; If you can't get fresh, use dried in an 
  amount that would be about the same size before drying.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Rather than using tomato paste called for 
  in recipes, I like to add a convenient 8oz can of a very simple tomato 
  sauce, which helps make up for deficient tomatoes. My favorite is 
  Faraon Spanish Style, but other simple sauces will also work.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chicken Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I make a lot of stock, but reserve it 
  for where it really counts, not where it will be overwhelmed with 
  other flavors. Here I used what many ethnicities have turned to these 
  days when they no longer have a stay-at-home all day cook. For three 
  cups I used a Tablespoon of Knorr <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html">
  <b>Chicken Powder</b></a> and 1 teaspoon 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_vegeta.html"><b>Vegeta</b></a>. It worked fine.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The Italian way of serving would be to mix 
  the sauce with the pasta (less sauce than Americans often use), 
  sprinkle the cheese over, toss, and serve in small bowls as a pasta 
  course. I don't serve it this way because I'm not Italian. I'm usually 
  serving "American style", as a main (or only) course, and want better 
  control of all elements at the table, as well as a more decorative 
  appearance. I serve similarly to the photo, though the sauce may be 
  at the side of the dish and the cheese in a separate bowl to be 
  applied as desired.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Alternate:</h3> &nbsp; This method produces a different texture, 
  but it may be preferred by many. Because the time for cutting the Giblets 
  and simmering to tender is so long, I decided to try using a meat 
  grinder (English "mincer"). I used the plate with the largest holes 
  and the two bladed cutter to maximize the size of the particals. It 
  was still much finer than the cut version. Procedure beyond that is 
  precisely the same, except take care with the frying step, it works 
  a little different. Watch the fond sticking to the pan. Chocolate is 
  fine, black is not. If it gets too dark go to the next step 
  immediately.</li>
