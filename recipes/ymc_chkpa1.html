<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/2 to 3 hrs depending - 20 min work)
<ol>
<li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN</b>, cut into large bite size pieces, or as 
  desired (see <a href="ymc_chkpa1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>).</li>
<li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
  Mix all <b>Marinade items</b>, then massage into <b>Chicken</b> 
  (in a non-reactive bowl). Set aside about 1-1/2 hrs in a cool place, 
  or about 3 hrs in the fridge.</li>
<li>Dilute <b>TOMATO PASTE</b> with <b>Water</b>. Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> 
  coarse, retaining all liquid. Mix together all <b>Sauce Items</b>, 
  including the <b>Tomato Liquid</b>.</li>
<li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
<li>Grate <b>Kefalotyri</b> for garnish.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
<ol start="6">
<li>Drain <b>Chicken</b> very well, retaining all the marinade.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, bring the <b>Sauce</b> to a simmer, cover and simmer 
  slowly while doing the next step.
<li>In a spacious skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. 
  Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry tumbling often until all the exuded 
  liquid has evaporated, then stir in <b>Onions</b>. Continue to fry, 
  tumbling often, until chicken is lightly browned. Be careful the fond 
  that sticks to the pan does not burn.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Chicken</b> and <b>Onions</b> into the sauce, along with 
  reserved <b>Marinade</b>. Use some of the sauce to deglaze the 
  pan and return to the pot. Simmer for about 40 minutes or until Chicken 
  is tender.</li>
<li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; timing so the chicken will done before the 
  pasta is done, bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook 
  <b>Pasta</b> the usual way until done (see <a href="ymc_chkpa1.html#04">
  <b>Note-4</b></a>). Drain, return to the pot and stir in a few drops of 
  <b>Olive Oil</b> to keep it from sticking (see <a href="ymc_chkpa1.html#05">
  <b>Note-5</b></a>).</li>
<li>To serve: use tongs to place <b>Pasta</b> onto plates. Top with 
  some pieces of <b>Chicken</b> and a scoop of <b>Sauce</b>. Serve hot 
  with grated <a>Kefalotkyri</a> on the side.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight given is for skinless, boneless chunks 
  (I prefer thigh or leg for flavor and texture). The pattern recipe 
  called for a 4 pound chicken cut into serving pieces, which you can do 
  if you wish. I find boneless chunks easier to serve, particularly for 
  buffet, and to discourage fighting at the dinner table. I cut them 2 
  inches on a side or a bit less.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; The correct pasta is Greek Pastitsio, a long 
  tubular pasta which comes in two sizes. the large is identical to 
  Italian Mezzanelli and Regine (0.175 inch diameter). The small is the 
  same as Italian Bucatini (0.11 inch diameter). While the large is 
  preferred, bucatini can be much easier to find.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Kefalotyri:</h3> &nbsp; This is a Greek grating cheese. Freshly 
  grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano are considered acceptable 
  substitutes.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cooking Pasta:</h3> &nbsp; While the Italians prefer their pasta 
  <i>al dente</i> with a rather stiff core, Greeks and Turks like theirs 
  soft all the way through (but not mushy!). Americans prefer in between, 
  and that's the way I cook it. For table service I break the pasta in 
  half, for buffet service in thirds.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Greek family service is rather different 
  from how I serve it. Rather than the Olive Oil, a couple spoons of 
  the sauce are stirred in to keep the pasta from sticking. The pasta, 
  chicken (bone in serving pieces), sauce and 
  grated cheese are all served in separate bowls and platters.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Buffet:</h3> &nbsp; I have served this as a buffet dish making 
  1-1/2 times the recipe except doubling the amount of Sauce. I served 
  it in an electric skillet set to warm with the pasta on one side, the 
  chicken and sauce on the other. Tongs and a serving spoon were provided 
  for the guests to use for serving.</li>
