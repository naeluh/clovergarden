Made as I have outlined, this dish has an intensely flavored sauce, and 
a fair amount of it. See <a href="ymc_chkwine1.html#04"><b>Changes</b></a> and

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>PORCINI</b> in hot water for a couple of hours. When 
    soft, Drain, squeeze out excess water and cut into small pieces. 
    Since the recipe as listed here needs extra water, I use the 
    soaking liquid (less any sand in the bottom). No sense in wasting 
    the expensive flavor.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> about 1-1/2 to 2 inches on a side (see 
    <a href="ymc_chkwine1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> for details).</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> into small pieces similar to the Porcini.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (55 min)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Lightly flour <b>Chicken</b>, shaking off any excess.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 2 T <b>Butter</b> and 
    1 T <b>Olive Oil</b>. Fry chicken pieces in batches until lightly 
    browned on all sides, removing and setting aside to drain. Add a 
    little more oil for later batches if needed.</li>
  <li>Add 1 T <b>Butter</b> to the pan and fry <b>Bacon</b> over 
    moderate heat until the fat is translucent. Stir in <b>Onions</b> 
    and <b>Mushrooms</b>. Fry stirring until Onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and fry stirring until well warmed through.
  </li> 
  <li>Pour <b>Brandy</b> over. You can light it off if you wish, but 
    stand well back, the flames will be high. When Brandy has evaporated, 
    stir in <b>Wine</b> and bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Add sufficient water for a simmering sauce (I include mushroom 
    soaking liquid). Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Turn 
    down the heat and simmer covered for about 30 minutes or until 
    Chicken is tender, stirring now and then. If it gets too dry, 
    stir in some boiling water.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot with pasta or potatoes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless with all 
  excess fat removed. Thigh and leg meat have much better flavor and 
  texture than cardboard flavored breasts we get around here. The 
  pattern recipe used a whole 2-1/2 pound chicken, cut into serving 
  pieces and fried skin-on, but meat pieces work better for buffet, 
  and to reduce fights at the family table. Note that the smaller you c
  ut the pieces, the more sauce you will have to have because there 
  will be more flour. Best to keep them around 2 inches or so, 1-1/2 
  inches minimum.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Porcini Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; These are very expensive, but 
  quite strong. I buy them from Nuts.com in an 8 ounce bag for a better 
  price. If you don't have them use fresh mushrooms, like Crimini, or 
  the small king trumpet mushrooms now common here in Southern 
  California, perhaps 4 ounces.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for bacon in the steps, 
  but fails to include it in the ingredients list (fairly common in 
  cookbooks published in England), so the amount is mine and I cut back 
  a bit on butter. You can omit the bacon and increase the butter if you 
  wish.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Changes:</h3> &nbsp; Aside from the changes described in Note-1 
  and Note-3, the pattern recipe was served in a pre-baked pastry pie 
  shell, the completed chicken arranged in the shell and served hot. 
  This may be fine for a sit-down dinner, but not for buffet service 
  or reheating, so I skip the pie shell.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; Served in the pie shell, I doubt this dish 
  would be preceeded by a pasta course, perhaps a soup course instead. 
  Served without the pie shell, the sauce would be used with pasta for 
  a pasta course and the chicken served as the next course. Here in 
  California we serve meat and pasta together, minimizing the number 
  of courses.</li>
