In Italy, Cannelloni is often made from fresh pasta, not by stuffing 
an open pipe, but in the manner of a jelly roll.  This recipe from 
Piedmont is one of few stuffed pasta recipes not from 
Emilia.

<b><u>Prep &nbsp; (First Day)</u></b> &nbsp; (3 hrs - all work)
<ol>
<li>Chop <b>BEEF</b> quite fine. Skin <b>SAUSAGE</b> and chop quite 
  fine. Mix. A mini-prep processor can be used, but do them separately 
  and don't process into mush.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine.</li>
<li>Grate <b>PARMESAN</b> fine (both batches).</li>
<li>Mix <b>Tomato Paste</b> with <b>Water</b>.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> over moderate 
  heat and Fry <b>Rosemary Sprig</b>, stirring for about 3 minutes, 
  then discard the sprig.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Onion</b> and <b>Meat mix</b>. Fry stirring until you 
  are getting some browning.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b>, <b>Chili Powder</b>, <b>Wine</b> 
  and <b>Tomato Paste mix</b>. Cover tightly and simmer slowly for about 
  1 hour, stirring now and then and check liquid. Uncover and simmer 
  until until there is no free liquid except oil. Set aside until 
  needed.</li>
<li><b>Meanwhile:</b> &nbsp; Make the B&eacute;chamel sauce (see 
  <a href="ymm_canpied1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>) - about 25 minutes</li>
<li>Make <b>Pasta Dough</b>. Roll out about 0.020 inch thick - I hope  
  you have a pasta machine. For complete instructions See our 
  <a href="../ingred/pa_italf.html"><b>Italian Fresh &amp; Stuffed 
  Pasta</b></a> page.</li>
<li>Cut the <b>Pasta</b> into rectangles about 4 inches by 5 inches. 
  You should have a fair number of these left over unless you tear a 
  lot of them in handling.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil, preferably in a wide fairly 
  shallow pan (I use a large saut&eacute; pan). Set a bowl of cold water 
  conveniently nearby.</li>
<li>A few at a time (3 to 5 depending on your pan) put the pasta 
  rectangles in the boiling water and boil them for 3 minutes. Fish 
  them out carefully and drop them in the cold water to chill. They will 
  be very slippery, so you will need something to lift them and something 
  like a wooden spoon to keep them from sliding off. Drain them well and 
  set them out on a cloth, or interleave in wax paper.</li>
<li>If you are making the pasta a day ahead, definitely interleave 
  with wax paper, wrap the bundle in plastic and refrigerate. Put the 
  bundle where nothing will be set on top of it or you will have a mess.
  </li>
<li>Mix grated <b>Parmesan</b> into the <b>Stuffing</b>. Because it 
  should be quite smooth for spreading, I usually run the stuffing 
  through the mini-prep at this stage, particularly if I've chopped 
  the meats by hand.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run &nbsp; (Second Day)</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 1 hr work) 
<ol start="15">
<li>Massage Stuffing with the <b>Egg</b>.</li>
<li>Butter a shallow baking dish. One 9-1/2 x 13 inches is good. Preheat 
  the oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.</li>
<li>Take a <b>Pasta</b> rectangle and spread 2 T of the stuffing on 
  it, leaving a 1/2 inch margin all around. Roll it up fairly tightly 
  in the direction so the length of the roll will be the short side of 
  the square. Set the roll in the baking dish seam side down. Repeat 
  until you run out of meat, pasta or room in the baking dish. You can 
  pack the rolls fairly tightly, but they should be in a single layer.</li>
<li>Carefully reheat the <b>B&eacute;chamel Sauce</b> if it is cold. It 
  doesn't have to come up to a full simmer but should be quite warm.</li>
<li>Dot the top of the Canellonis with 2 T <b>Butter</b>. Pour the 
  <b>B&eacute;chamel Sauce</b> over them and spread evenly. Sprinkle 
  with <b>Parmesan</b>. Dot the top again with 1 T <b>Butter</b>.</li>
<li>Place in the oven and bake until top is very lightly browned - 25 
  to 40 minutes, depending. then turn the oven off and let sit in there 
  for 10 minutes more to settle.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless with all 
  fat removed. Shoulder is a good cut for this, flavorful but not too 
  tough.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Either Red or White can be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>B&eacute;chamel Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This is easy 
  to make by our recipe <a href="yjd_bescimal1.html"><b>Besciamella 
  Sauce</b></a> (the Italian name - they invented it, not the French).</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Be aware, this dish is a bit 
  of a project, so don't start it if you don't want a project. It is 
  best to make the B&eacute;chamel, Stuffing (except the egg) and Pasta 
  all the day before and refrigerate. This is good not only for your 
  energy level and sanity, but also makes it possible to time when the 
  dish will be done. See <a href="ymm_canpied1x.html"><b>Photo 
  Page</b></a> for step photos.</li>
