Beef Cheeks are tender, moist and delicious cooked this way. This recipe 
is my compilation from from several similar Italian recipes. See also

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Trim <b>BEEF CHEEKS</b> as needed (weight given is after 
    trimming)</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small. Dice <b>TURNIP</b> into 1/2 inch cubes. 
    Chop <b>CELERY</b> small. Chop <b>CARROT</b> small. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>TOMATOES</b> medium and return to their Juice.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 Hours) 
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Pat <b>Beef Cheeks</b> dry with paper towels. Rub them 
    <u>lightly</u> with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>In heavy skillet heat 2 T <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Beef 
    Cheeks</b> in batches until lightly browned on both sides. Transfer 
    to a heavy bottomed non-reactive pot or Dutch oven that will hold at 
    least 4 quarts.</li>
  <li>After all the Beef Cheeks are done, pour remaining oil out of the 
    skillet. Replace with 2 T <b>ExtV Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> until onions are translucent. Pour vegetables and 
    oil into the pot with the Beef Cheeks.</li>
  <li>Pour 1/2 cup <b>Wine</b> into the skillet and bring to a simmer. 
    Scrape up any fond adhering to the pan and pour into the pot along 
    with the rest of the <b>Wine</b>, the <b>Tomatoes</b> (including 
    juice) and <b>Star Anise</b>.</li>
  <li>Bring pot to a boil, then cover tightly and simmer very slowly 
    for about 3-1/4 hours or until Beef Cheeks are tender.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Beef Cheeks</b> and set aside.</li>
  <li>Strain the liquid through a fine strainer. Discard the solids.</li>
  <li>Defat the sauce using your gravy separator, then simmer it down 
    to the amount you will need. If you feel the need, you can thicken 
    the sauce a little with a blonde roux (the sauce in the photo was 
    thickened for better behavior during photography).  Keep hot.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Beef Cheeks</b> as desired. Reheat and serve hot with 
    sauce.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Cheeks:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after 
  trimming excess fat. Do not over-trim connective tissue. To get 3 
  pounds trimmed, you'll need to buy about 5 pounds untrimmed. For 
  details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_cheekz.html"><b>Beef 
  Cheeks</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Kosher Salt:</h3> &nbsp; In most cases there is 
  no purpose to using kosher salt - if you don't want iodine, there's 
  plenty of regular no-iodine salt. For coating meat though, that's 
  what kosher salt was invented for. Diamond Crystal brand is best 
  because it is fluffier.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Wine:</h3> &nbsp; An Italian red such as Chianti or Lambrusco 
  is in order.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe set up the meats and liquids 
  as above, but cooked in a 325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven for 3+ hours. I 
  simmered this on the stove top where I could monitor it closely, and 
  that worked just as well.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The serving style in the photo above is 
  clearly American. In Italy the pasta would be lightly sauced, using 
  sauce from the meat, and served as a Pasta course. This would be 
  followed by the meat course. Here in California, we minimize the 
  number of courses.</li>
