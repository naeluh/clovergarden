This beef dish, with intensely flavorful sauce, can be made with chunks 
of beef for buffet service, or a cut of beef sliced for more formal 
service (see <a href="ymm_cowmagd1.html#06"><b>Method</b></a> and <a href="ymm_cowmagd1.html#07">

<p>The pattern recipe is from S&uuml;dtirol, but I expect it's made 
similarly in Germany.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>If going buffet, cut <b>BEEF</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inches 
    on a side - not too small, because you'll be fishing the beef out, 
    twice.</li>
  <li>Massage <b>Beef</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Set 
    aside.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b>, <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>CELERY</b> quite small. 
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATO</b> in boiling water 1 minute, quench in cold 
    water, peel and chop small. Mix with <b>Tomato Pur&eacute;e</b>.</li>
  <li>Lightly crush <b>GARLIC</b>.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>PORCINI</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (2 to 2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a spacious coverable saut&eacute; pan or heavy dutch oven 
    (see <a href="ymm_cowmagd1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>) heat <b>Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Beef</b> over moderate heat until all exuded liquid has evaporated 
    and the meat is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Beef</b>, leaving as much oil as possible behind. Stir in 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and fry over moderate heat until onions threaten to 
    show some color.</li> 
  <li>Pour into a strainer to remove excess oil, if needed. Return 
    vegetables to the pan along with <b>Tomato mix</b>. Fry stirring 
    over moderate heat until the tomatoes start to soften.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Wine</b>, scraping the fond from the pan to deglaze, 
    then add back <b>Beef</b> and simmer down until there is almost no 
    liquid..</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Broth</b>, <b>Garlic</b>, <b>Porcini</b> and 
    <b>Herbs</b>. Cover tightly and simmer slowly, turning Beef now and 
    then, until Beef is tender. This can be 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours 
    depending on cut and whether chunks or whole cut. Whole cut should 
    come to 145&deg;F/63&deg;C (rare) to 160&deg;F/70&deg;C (medium 
    rare) in the center.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Beef</b> from pan. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Press sauce through a strainer, discarding solids. Defat Sauce 
    (use your gravy separator). Simmer down to a light sauce consistency. 
    Check Seasoning.</li>
  <li>If <b>Beef</b> is in chunks, stir back in until reheated and coated 
    with sauce (see <a href="ymm_cowmagd1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Arrowroot</b> with 1 T <b>Water</b> and stir in to thicken 
    the sauce if desired (see <a href="ymm_cowmagd1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).
  <li>Serve hot with Potatoes or similar.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without bones and all 
  excess fat removed.  Chuck is good for this recipe, round is ok but 
  takes a bit longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Porcini:</h3> &nbsp; These are Dried Mushrooms, available at 
  Italian markets and often regular supermarkets (at a high price), but 
  there is no real substitute. They are more economically bought on-line. 
  They store well, so you can buy an economical quantity.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Red Wine:</h3> &nbsp; St. Magdalener is the specified wine, but 
  can be hard to find and expensive here in Southern California. It is 
  a light bodied, fruity red wine made from trollinger 
  grapes in Germany and S&uuml;dtirol, Italy. The pattern recipe suggests 
  Barolo as a substitute, but the Barolo at Trader Joe's was priced 
  rather high for cooking. I used a Trentatre Rosso and it worked fine.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Arrowroot:</h3> This hasn't quite the thickening power of 
  cornstarch, but is more heat stable and neutral in taste. If making 
  the dish in advance, stir in the Arrowroot upon reheating to a 
  simmer.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Saut&eacute; Pan / Dutch Oven:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe 
  fries and braises the meat as a whole chunk, so a large, 
  non-reactive Dutch oven is needed. I fry as cubes, so a suitable 
  saut&eacute; pan is better, and the meat doesn't need constant 
  basting. </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The method used by the pattern recipe is more 
  suited to restaurant service or formal occasions. The beef is browned 
  as a single piece (brisket or silverside (UK for bottom  round or rump 
  roast)). It is sliced after cooking, then served with a scoop of sauce 
  over and mashed potatoes on the side. The recipe proceeds as above, 
  but is braised in a 325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven, basting the meat now 
  and then. With so much liquid I see no reason the meat can't be 
  finished on the stovetop (here in sunny Southern California we don't 
  fire up an oven unless we really need to).</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Serving:</h3>> &nbsp; For formal service, make as a whole cut of 
  beef. Slice it and plate the slices with a scoop of sauce over and 
  mashed potatoes on the side. For buffet service, I do this recipe 
  entirely on the stovetop, but serve it in a slow cooker set to "keep 
  warm". I'm too much a control freak to cook anything in a slow cooker 
  (a very few exceptions), and they just take way too long to warm 
  anything up for serving, but once the dish is done and hot, the slow 
  cooker works fine. </li>
