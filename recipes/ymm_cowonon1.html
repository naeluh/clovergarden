A beef stew from Greece, similar to Italian 
<a href="ymm_cowspez1.html"><b>Beef with Tomato & Peas</b></a>. 
Greece is not suitable for cattle, so beef recipes have been adopted 
from other countries.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into cubes about 1-1/4 inches on a side.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b>. Mix.</li>
  <li>Bring plenty of water to a boil. Pour in <b>BOILING ONIONS</b> 
    and stir them around for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes depending on size. 
    Drain and chill with cold water. Cut off the tip and peel. Trim the 
    root ends as little as you can so the onions hold together. All this 
    can be done while the Beef is simmering, or a couple of days ahead 
    and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (2 to 2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a 3-1/2 quart saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Beef</b> over highest heat until all exuded liquid has 
    evaporated and the meat is lightly browned on all sides. Take 
    care the fond stuck to the bottom of the pan doesn't burn.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Beef</b>, leaving as much oil as possible behind.</li>
  <li> Stir in <b>Onion mix</b> and fry over moderate heat until onions 
    are translucent.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Sauce mix</b> and bring to a simmer. Cook over low heat 
    scraping up the fond from the bottom of the pan until it is all 
    incorporated into the sauce.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Beef</b> back in and bring to a boil. Simmer covered over 
    very low heat (see <a href="ymm_cowonon1.html#04"><b>Cooking</b></a>) for 1 to 1-1/4 
    hours depending on cut.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Boiling Onions</b> and <b>Currants</b>. Bring back to 
    a simmer for another 1 to 1-1/2 hours depending on cut. Finish 
    simmering uncovered to thicken sauce as desired (see 
    <a href="ymm_cowonon1.html#04"><b>Cooking</b></a>).</li> 
  <li>Serve with Potatoes or Pasta (see <a href="ymm_cowonon1.html#05"><b>Serving</b></a>).

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without bones and all excess fat 
  removed.  Chuck is good for this recipe, Round is ok but takes a bit 
  longer cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Boiling Onions:</h3> &nbsp; Pearl onions are a real hassle (and 
  expensive). I select the smallest boiling onions I can find in a bin 
  at a local market, ideally about 1 inch, but sometimes I have to 
  settle for a little larger.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Crushed Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  "tomato pur&eacute;e, but I like some texture so use crushed or 
  diced.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Cooking:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe fries the beef in a 
  skillet, then places it in a casserole. The sauce is used to deglaze 
  the skillet and is then poured over the beef. The recipe is finished 
  in a preheated 325&deg;F/165&deg;C oven. Here in Southern California 
  we don't heat up an oven unless we really need to, and the recipe 
  admits it can be done all on the stovetop. Also, if you don't have a 
  large enough saut&eacute; pan you can use the skillet method and 
  finish in a pot (or in the oven). A slow cooker would also work fine, 
  but would need more time.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; Served as a party buffet dish I would leave 
  the sauce fairly liquid, adding potatoes to the stew. This makes it 
  less likely some clown will eat all the beef. Peel and cube the 
  potatoes. Cook them in boiling water until just done, then stir into 
  the stew a little before serving. White Rose potatoes work well and 
  red could be used, but avoid Yukon Gold types - they turn to mush if 
  cooked a little beyond the minimum.</li>
