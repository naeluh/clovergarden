<p>Color and flavor depend on careful and thorough browning of the lamb 
necks. This stew reheats very well if the pasta hasn't been added.</p>

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3 hrs - 1-1/4 hrs work)
<ol>
<li>Trim <b>LAMB NECKS</b> of excess fat. In a 5 quart Dutch oven or 
  similar heavy pot (see <a href="ymm_lmbneck1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>)  heat <b>Olive 
  Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b>. Over very moderate heat fry lamb necks, 
  turning frequently, until nicely browned all over.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> and <b>CELERY</b> coarse. Cut <b>CARROTS</b> into 
  rounds, half rounds or quarter rounds (depending on size) between 1/8 
  and 1/4 inch thick. Quarter  <b>FENNEL BULB</b> lengthwise leaving the 
  root end on to hold it together. Mix all.</li>
<li>Grind <b>Fennel Seeds</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Cinnamon</b>. Crush 
  <b>Orange  Peel</b>. Mix all with <b>Red Pepper Flakes</b>.</li>
<li>Toast <b>ALMONDS</b>, cool thoroughly and grind to a fine powder 
  along with <b>Chocolate</b>.</li>
<li>When the <b>Lamb Necks</b> are thoroughly browned, add <b>Stock</b> 
  and <b>Red Wine</b>. Bring to a boil and skim off any scum that rises.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Fennel Seed mix</b>, <b>Diced Tomatoes</b> (including 
  juice) and <b>Bay Leaves</b>. Simmer covered for 1-1/4 hour.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Vegetable mix</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer 
  another 3/4 hour.</li>
<li>Fish out <b>Bay Leaves</b> and <b>Fennel Bulb</b>. Discard.</li>
<li>Fish out <b>Lamb Necks</b> and remove meat from the bones. Tear meat 
  into pieces and add back to the pot. Discard bones.</li>
<li>Skim all fat from the stew. (See <a href="ymm_lmbneck1.html#03"><b>Note-5</b></a>).
  </li>
<li>Stir in  <b>Almond mix</b>. Bring back to a boil and simmer for a few 
  minutes stirring occasionally. Taste for <b>Salt</b> and adjust if 
  needed.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook <b>PASTA</b> the usual 
  way. Drain and stir in a little <b>Olive Oil</b> to keep it from sticking 
  together.</li>
<li>When ready to serve. add <b>Pasta</b> only to the amount of stew you 
  intend to serve right away. Alternatively, you can spoon some pasta into 
  individual bowls and then ladle stew over.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Parsley Leaves</b> and accompanied with 
  grated <b>Romano Cheese</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb Necks:</h3> &nbsp; These are generally available in markets 
  serving Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and other sheep eating ethnic 
  communities. For details see our <a href="../ingred/as_neckz.html">
  <b>Lamb Necks</b></a> page. Other lean lamb meat could be used - you 
  want about 1-3/4 pounds of raw meat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Orange Peel:</h3> &nbsp; 1/8 inch wide strips of dried orange peel 
  are used in the Mediterranean region. If you have none, use fresh 
  orange peel but about twice as much.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chocolate:</h3> &nbsp; I use Mexican Chocolate which works well in 
  recipes and sauces.  For details ee our 
  <a href="../ingred/ei_mexchocz.html"><b>Mexican Chocolate</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Beef, Lamb or even Chicken stock can be used, 
  but should be quite strong.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fat:</h3> &nbsp; I often pour a stew through a strainer, catch 
  the liquid and defat it using my gravy separator, but you could also 
  turn the heat low and skim the fat off. A few drops left won't hurt.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Browning:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have a Dutch oven this large, 
  you can brown the lamb in a heavy iron skillet. When you remove the 
  lamb to your stew pot you can deglaze the skillet with the red wine.
