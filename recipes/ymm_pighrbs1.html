This very flavorful stew, from Tuscany, is made with herbs and reduced 
white wine. It is delicious as is - but, if need be, it can be extended. 
(see <a href="ymm_pighrbs1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>).

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inches on a side.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> and <b>CELERY</b> small. Mix.</li>
<li>Strip leaves of <b>SAGE</b> and <b>ROSEMARY</b> from stems and chop 
  small. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop small. Mix all with 
  <b>Bay Leaves</b>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
<ol start="4">
<li>In a 3-1/2 qt saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir 
  <b>Pork</b> over high heat, tumbling now and then until any exuded 
  liquid has evaporated and the pork is lightly browned. Watch that 
  fond forming on the pan is not burned - chocolate is OK, black is 
  not. When done, remove, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.
  </li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Vegis mix</b> and fry stirring a minute. Stir in 
  <b>Herb mix</b> and fry stirring now and then until onions are 
  translucent.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Pork</b> back in, then stir in <b>Wine</b>. Keep it bubbling 
  until wine is almost entirely reduced and the stew would soon be dry.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <u>1 cup</u> of the <b>Stock</b>. Reduce it the same as you 
  did the wine.</li>
<li>Stir in the rest of the <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a boil, then turn to 
  simmer. Cover tightly and simmer until the Pork is tender, about 1-1/2 
  hours. Stir now and then and check if more liquid is needed.</li>
<li>Serve hot garnished with <b>Herbs</b>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all bones and excess 
  fat removed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; Usually, when making a pork dish like this, 
  I buy big chunks of pork leg and make plenty of stock with the 
  offcuts, fat, bones and skin. For method for making and storing, see 
  our recipe <a href="goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / Broth</b></a>. 
  The pattern recipe suggests making a stock with 2 Celery Sticks, 
  2 Carrots, 1 Onion, 4 cloves, and 2 bouillon cubes (amount of water 
  not given). Following modern practice by tropical ethnicities that no 
  longer have a full day cook in the household, I have made stock with 
  3 cups boiling water, 1 Tablespoon of Knorr 
  <a href="../ingred/sa_chkpowd.html"><b>Chicken Powder</b></a> and 1 
  teaspoon <a href="../ingred/sa_vegeta.html"><b>Vegeta</b></a>.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; I did a double recipe of this in preparation 
  for a party. My guests are very good eaters, so, after taking the 
  "official" photo (see above), I extended it a bit. I peeled a couple 
  Potatoes and Carrots and cut them into chunks to match the pork. I 
  chopped a little more Rosemary and Sage and put it all in a pot with 
  more Stock to just cover. After simmering until just done, I stirred 
  it all into the stew and simmered a few minutes more.</li>
