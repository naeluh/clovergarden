Most Pork Marsala recipes you'll find use pork loin pounded flat with a 
fancy sauce, rather "gourmet". I have, however, found a few Italian 
recipes in more practical styles.

<p>This recipe is my own distillation of various approaches, configured 
for easy buffet service.</p>
<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hrs - 10 min work)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>PORK</b> into cubes about 1-1/2 inches on a side. Massage with 
  all <b>Marinade items</b> and let marinade for 2 hours at room 
  temperature (or 6 hours in the fridge), turning now and then.</li>
<li>Soak <b>MUSHROOMS</b> (if using dried) for an hour in just enough 
  warm water to rehydrate.</li>
<li>Strip <b>ROSEMARY</b> leaves from stems and chop small. Crush 
  <b>JUNIPER</b>. Mix.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
<ol start="4">
<li>Drain <b>Pork</b> well, retaining free <b>Marinade</b>. Dry the pork 
  cubes on paper towels so they will brown.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and <b>Butter</b>. 
  Fry <b>Pork</b> in batches over moderate flame until very lightly browned 
  on all sides - not so brown as to stiffen it.</li>
<li>Pour off all the fat from the pan.</li>
<li>Return all <b>Pork</b> to the pan, along with <b>Marinade</b>, 
  <b>Rosemary mix</b>, <b>Mushrooms</b>, 1/2 cup <b>Soaking Liquid</b> 
  <b>Marsala</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly 
  and simmer over very low heat, turning now and then, until pork is tender, 
  about 1 hour or so depending on cut.</li>
<li>Adjust liquid to the desired consistency (not too dry).</li>
<li>Serve garnished with <b>Rosemary Sprigs</b>, along with steamed medium 
  grain rice, bread or pasta as desired.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with all bones and excess fat removed. 
  Most recipes call for loin, but other cuts can work with the method 
  given here. Many recipes cut loin into large slices and pound them flat 
  with a mallet before frying. Some recipes cook a whole loin roast and 
  slice it when done, serving with sauce.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Officially, these should be dried Porcini, 
  which are rather costly and sometimes difficult to find around here. 
  Some recipes use fresh Portabelas or Crimini - different flavor but 
  certainly workable. I have found quite usable dried mushrooms from 
  China in large Asian markets here in Los Angeles, and use a mix of 
  different kinds - but not Shiitakes / Chinese Black Mushrooms which 
  are too strong and distinctively Asian.</li>
