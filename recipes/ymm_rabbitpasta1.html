This recipe shows the Italian way of cooking a meat course and sauce 
for pasta together. In Italy, the pasta course would be served before 
the meat, but this is California.

<p>This recipe would be pretty much the same (and a lot cheaper) made 
with chicken thighs.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut up your <b>RABBIT</b> into serving pieces. Don't waste all that 
    unrecoverable meat on the carcass, make a soup stock just as for 
    chicken, rabbit makes a very good soup stock.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small, chop <b>GARLIC</b> small, mix.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>TOMATOES</b> saving the juice, chop up a bit smaller and 
    add back to juice.</li>
  <li>Stem <b>MUSHROOMS</b>, cut caps in half one way, then into slices the 
    other way.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Heat <b>Olive Oil</b> over moderate heat and fry <b>Onion mix</b> 
    until soft.
  <li>Add <b>Rabbit</b>, sprinkle with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b> and 
    continue to fry over moderate heat, tumbling more and more frequently 
    until the onions are light golden.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, grate in just a little <b>Nutmeg</b>, add the 
    <b>CLoves</b>. Cover and simmer, tumbling occasionaly for about 45 
    minutes or until rabbit is fork tender.</li>
  <li>Remove rabbit and keep warm to serve separately.</li>
  <li>Stir <b>Mushrooms</b> into sauce and simmer an additional 10 minutes, 
    adjusting consistency and salt as required.</li>
  <li>In Italy, the sauce would be served with pasta as a pasta course, 
  rabbit as a meat course following. In California, we serve it all 
  togeher a shown in the photo, to minimize the number of courses the 
  kitchen must deal with.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Red Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; A fairly mild dried red pepper powder or 
  flake, like Kashmir or Korean, would be about right - Italians are 
  wimps on chilis. For details see our <a href="../ingred/chilip.html">
