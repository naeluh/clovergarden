Mild, tender sweetbreads were once popular, but now appear only in fancy 
restaurants - and in Mediterranean cuisine. This dish was <u>very</u> 
popular at a recent buffet party.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (4-1/2 to 8-1/2 hrs depending - 20 min work)
<ol>
<li>Prepare the <b>SWEETBREADS</b> in accordance with the instructions on 
  our <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html"><b>Veal Sweetbreads</b></a> page.</li>
<li>Slice <b>Sweetbreads</b> about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
<li>Soak <b>DRIED MUSHROOMS</b> in enough water to cover for an hour 
  or more. Drain, reatining the soaking liquid, and chop fine.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop 
  <b>PARSLEY</b> fairly fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Trim <b>MUSHROOM</b> stems flush with the caps. Slice caps thin. Chop 
  stem pieces small.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol start="6">
<li>In a auce pan heat 1/4 c <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion mix</b> until 
  translucent. Stir in chopped <b>Soaked Mushrooms</b> for a minute or so, 
  then the <b>Fresh Mushrooms</b>. Fry stirring for 1 minute, then stir in 
  1/2 cup <b>Soaking Liquid</b>, <b>Marsala</b>, <b>Stock</b>, <b>Salt</b> 
  and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Cook on a fast simmer, stirring now and then, until most, but not all, 
  the liquid has evaporated.</li>
<li>Stir <b>Cornstarch</b> into <b>Cream</b> unitl well distributed, then 
  stir into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer and simmer slowly for a few 
  minutes until the sauce has thickened. Adjust liquid if needed and keep 
  warm.</li>
<li>Melt 1/4 cup <b>Butter</b> and tumble the <b>Sweetbreads</b> with it 
  until well coated. Then tumble them with <b>Breadcrumbs</b> until lightly 
  coated.</li>
<li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan or skillet, heat <b>Butter</b> (more) and 
  <b>Olive Oil</b>. Fry <b>Sweetbreads</b>, tumbling often until golden 
  on both sides.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Sweetbreads:</h3> &nbsp; These are generally available 
  in markets serving Turkish, Armenian, Middle Eastern and Latin American 
  communities. For details see our <a href="../ingred/ab_sweebz.html">
  <b>Veal Sweetbreads</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms, dried:</h3> &nbsp; Officially, these should be dried 
  Porcini, which are rather costly and sometimes difficult to find around 
  here. Some recipes use fresh Portabelas or Crimini - different flavor 
  but certainly workable. I have found quite usable dried mushrooms from 
  China in large Asian markets here in Los Angeles and use a mix of 
  different kinds - but not Shiitakes / Chinese Black Mushrooms which are 
  too strong and distinctively Asian.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; For table service you can arrange 
  as in the photo (actual sauce color will be lighter because I increased 
  the amount of cream and cornstarch after the photo was taken). For buffet 
  service I tumble the Sweetbreads with the Sauce and put thim in a warmer 
  - with a smallish serving spoon to encourage taking smaller portions.</li>
