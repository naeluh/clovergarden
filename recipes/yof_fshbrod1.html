The correct seafood for this soup is whatever you've got. It has long 
been made by Romagna fishermen's wives out of whatever didn't sell that 
day.

There are countless variations, but all agree that Tomatoes, Olive Oil, 
and Wine must be major ingredients. This is a substantial soup, so if 
you're looking for a light fish soup, this isn't it. This recipe is 
based on one more than 100 years old. Also see <a href="yof_fshbrod1.html#02">

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into largish chunks. Mussel and clam meat can be 
    left whole (unless very large). Shrimp can be left whole or cut in 
    half, depending on size. If making ahead, this step can be delayed 
    until the hour before serving, as can the next step.</li>
  <li>Cut squid, octopus, and cuttlefish (use small ones) into convenient 
    size pieces (they will shrink a lot, so not too small). <u>Hold 
    these separately</u> as they need longer cooking than the fish.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Peel strips of <b>LEMON ZEST</b>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish, if used.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2 hr))
  <ol start="10">
  <li>In 3-1/2 qt saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Vinegar</b> until bubbling 
    well. Stir in  <b>Onions</b> and bring back to a boil, then turn to 
    a simmer, covered, for 15 minutes or until onions are soft. Stir now 
    and then and checking if needing liquid.  When Onions are soft, 
    uncover and simmer until all liquid is gone.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Olive Oil</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Fry over 
    moderate heat, stirring often, until Onions are golden.</li>
 <li>Stir in <b>Lemon Zest</b> and <b>Garlic</b>. Fry stirring about 
     1 minute.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>. Bring to a light boil until thickened, 
    but not nearly dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Wine</b>. Bring to a boil for long enough tor reduce 
    the volume by about 1/3.</li>
  <li>At this point the <b>Soup Base</b> can be cooled and refrigerated 
    until near serving time.</li>
  <li>In a 5 quart pot, bring the <b>Soup Base</b> up to a simmer. Stir 
    in <b>Shellfish</b> that toughen (squid, octopus, cuttlefish, etc.) 
    and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to adjust liquid with boiling water if needed - but 
    this soup should be pretty crowded, even more crowded than in the 
    photo example is OK.</li>
  <li>Stir in  <b>Fish</b> and non-toughening <b>Shellfish</b> (clams, 
    mussels, shrimp, sea cucumbers, etc.), bring just to a boil, cover 
    and simmer until thickest pieces are cooked through, 5 minutes or 
    just a little more.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, garnished with Parsley if desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Seafood:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish pieces without heads, 
  bones or fins. Include in this weight shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, 
  and/or octopus (use small ones), and whatever have you. Select fish 
  that hold together reasonably well with wet cooking. For details see 
  our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> 
  page (very large page). For Shellfish, I buy from the Asian markets, 
  frozen and packed in plastic bags: small clam meats, small mussel 
  meats, tiny cuttlefish, tiny octopi, shrimp, etc.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Many photos show Brodetto with shell-on 
  shrimp, in-the-shell clams and mussels, etc. This makes a fine display 
  for a restaurant presentation, or an intimate dinner for two, but 
  makes no sense whatever for buffet service. Since I target most of my 
  recipes to casual dining or buffet service, I use everything shelled.
  The 100 year old pattern recipe gives no indication ingredients are 
  "shell on".</li>
