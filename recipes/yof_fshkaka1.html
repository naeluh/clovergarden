600 BCE.

<p>Unlike most Greek fish soups, the fish itself is served with 
the the broth rather than as a separate course. For more details see 
<a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#10"><b>Note-10</b></a>.</p>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>FISH</b> as needed and cut into largish chunks. Lightly 
    salt the fish and set aside for at least 10 minutes, then rinse.</li>
  <li> Shell and de-vein <b>SHRIMP</b> and prepare other <b>Shellfish</b> 
    as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TOMATOES</b> and chop small. Dice <b>FENNEL</b> (or 
  Celery) small. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Mix all <b>Broth items</b>. 
  See also <a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#11"><b>Note-11</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>.</li>
  <li>Make <b>TOAST</b> (or croutons) if using (see 
  <a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>).</ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr))
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a large heavy bottomed pot, heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onions</b> until just translucent.</li>
  <li> Stir in <b>Broth Mix</b>, bring to a boil and simmer for about 
    45 minutes.</li>
  <li>At this point some cooks strain the stock and press the vegetable 
    pulp through a strainer, discarding all fibrous matter. Another 
    strategy is to run the strained vegies in a food processor - or 
    don't even bother straining or processing, as I do, your choice.</li>
  <li>Bring the <b>Broth</b> back to a boil and stir in <b>Fish</b>. 
    Simmer slowly for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Shrimp</b> and <b>Shellfish</b>.  Heat only until the 
    first few bubbles, then keep below a boil or the shellfish will 
    toughen. Thy should be cooked in less than 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and liquid. If more is needed (see 
    <a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> and <a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#09"><b>Note-9</b></a>) 
    add water that has just been boiled and allowed to cool a few degrees. 
    Stir in <b>Lemon Juice</b>.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Toasted Bread</b> (if used) in soup bowls and ladle soup 
    over, or serve croutons on the side. If you wish, drizzle with a few 
    drops of <b>Olive Oil</b>. Serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish pieces without heads, bones 
  or scales. Light colored, moderately flavored fish that hold together 
  reasonably well with wet cooking are best, or whatever chunks you have 
  in your freezer compartment. bass, cod, hake, haddock, halibut, trout, 
  pollack, snapper, rockfish, whiting and others are used. For details 
  see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> 
  page (very big page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Shellfish:</h3> &nbsp; Any of squid, scallops, mussels, clams, 
  periwinkles, lobster and baby octopus may be used.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Onion:</h3> &nbsp; Leeks may be used instead of onions, or even 
  scallions.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomatoes:</h3> &nbsp; These are from the Americas, so could not 
  have been used in ancient times, but are always included today.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Fennel:</h3> &nbsp; Stems may be used here rather than bulbs if 
  you are going to strain the soup (see steps). Celery is sometimes used 
  instead of fennel (include some leaves).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Wine:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for a dry white wine, but at 
  least one of my older Greek cookbooks calls for red.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Stock / Water:</h3> &nbsp; Preferable is a light fish broth (which 
  can be made a few days ahead from the heads, bones and fins of the fish 
  you will be using - freeze the fillets immediately). If none is 
  available, water can be used. If serving with toast, you will probably 
  need more than given in the recipe (see <a href="yof_fshkaka1.html#09">
  <b>Note-9</b></a>).</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Potatoes aren't any more "authentic" than 
  Tomatoes, but more than half the recipes for this soup now call from 
  them. White Rose work well, but avoid Yukon Gold types which turn to 
  mush if cooked a little beyond the minimum. Cut potatoes into about 
  3/4 inch cubes and boil them separately until just cooked through. 
  Add to the soup near the end of cooking, or you can add them on the 
  first reheating.</li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Toast:</h3> &nbsp; In Greece this soup is expected to be served 
  over squares of toast or with toasted croutons. If you serve it this 
  way, you will need to see that there's enough liquid. Add more if 
  needed, the bread absorbs a lot. Use Italian or French bread, slice 1/2 
  inch thick and toast in a pre-heated oven at 357&deg;F/190&deg;C.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Details:</h3> &nbsp;  Exact flavor will depend on the types of fish 
  used - usually a mix of whatever is available that day. This soup is 
  usually made in large quantity, as given here, because it gets better 
  over a few days. You could do a half recipe, but less than that would 
  not work well.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Some add some fish at the point the tomatoes go 
  in and squeeze it through a strainer as described in the steps to make 
  a thicker soup. This is less important if you are using fish stock 
  rather than water. Quite a few recipes include a couple diced carrots 
  with the tomato mix.</li>
