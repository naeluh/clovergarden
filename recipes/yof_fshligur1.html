This traditional fish soup is very versatile. It can be soup, stew or pasta 
sauce depending on how thick it is made. Exact flavor will depend on the

<p>Usually more than one kind is used so this soup is a great way to use 
up chunks of fish left over in your freezer.</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>FISH</b> as needed and cut into largish chunks.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CELERY</b> and <b>CARROT</b> fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix with Tomatoes.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr))
  <ol start="6">
  <li>In a large heavy bottomed sauce pan heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onions</b> until just translucent. Stir in <b>Celery Mix</b> and 
    fry, stirring often, for another 5 minutes, then stir in <b>Parsley</b>.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Wine</b> and cook until it reduces by about half.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>.  Cook for about another 3 minutes, 
    stirring now and then.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b> and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 
    about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish</b> and simmer another 12 minutes or until fish 
    is just cooked through.</li>
  <li>Remove <b>Fish chunks</b>, leaving behind any tiny pieces. Break 
    the chunks up into soup size pieces.</li>
  <li>Pur&eacute;e <b>Soup</b> (except fish) in a food processor or by 
    some other means.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, bring soup back to a simmer and season to 
    taste with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Stir fish back in.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Toasted Bread</b> in soup bowls and ladle soup over.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish pieces without 
  heads, bones or scales. Light colored fish that hold together reasonably 
  well with wet cooking are best, or whatever chunks you have in your 
  freezer compartment. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very big page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Water:</h3> &nbsp; If you will be serving over toast 
  you need at least as much water as given - the toast absorbs a lot. If 
  you will not be using toast reduce by about 1 cup. Of course, if you have 
  some fish stock on hand you can use it to replace some of the water.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Toast:</h3> &nbsp; This should be made, of course 
  from Italian bread, but French will do. Slice 1/2 inch thick and toast 
  in a pre-heated 357&deg;F/190&deg;C oven.</li>
