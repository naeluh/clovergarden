As are most Italian fish soups, this one is made of whatever seafood 
you can find at the time - the more kinds the better. Some 
of it can be those odd bits of seafood from your freezer.

<p>Early in a recent party I noticed no-one was trying this soup. 
Apparently someone eventually did, because at clean-up time there was 
none left.</p>

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; This can be done days ahead 
    if you freeze the Fish Fillets and store the stock per our 
    instructions.
  <ol>
  <li>Fillet your fish. If you are unfamiliar with this, see our page 
    <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishcr.html"><b>Cleaning and Filleting Round 
    Bodied Fish</b></a>. You can have the fish man scale and clean the 
    fish, as you won't need those parts.</li>
  <li>Use Heads, Bones, Fins, and in some cases Skins to make 
    Fish Stock. For details see our 
    <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a> page. </li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> one minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
    water and peel. Chop small.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into largish chunks. Mussel and clam meat can be 
    left whole (unless very large). Shrimp can be left whole or cut in 
    half, depending on size. Cut squid and octopus (use small ones) into 
    convenient size pieces (they will shrink a lot, so not too small). 
    Mix all - but if you used larger squid, octopus of cuttlefish, hold 
    separate as they will need longer cooking.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. 
    Chop <b>ANCHOVIES</b> fine. Mix all.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CELERY</b> and <b>CARROT</b> very fine. Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr))
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In a large heavy bottomed pot heat <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry 
    <b>Onion mix</b> until just translucent. Stir in <b>Celery Mix</b> 
    and fry, stirring often, for another 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Bay Leaf</b> and <b>Stock</b>.
    Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer slowly about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>See <a href="yof_fshzuppa1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Fish mix</b>, bring just to a boil, cover and simmer 
    slowly 10 minutes or until fish is just cooked through.</li>
  <li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Adjust liquid as needed 
    (see <a href="yof_fshzuppa1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>), garnish with <b>Parsley</b> and 
    serve hot.</li> 
  <li>IF serving over <b>Toast</b>: &nbsp; See <a href="yof_fshzuppa1.html#04">
    <b>Note-4</b></a>. Place Toast in soup bowls and ladle soup over. 
    Sprinkle on a little <b>Parsley</b> for garnish and serve hot.
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for fish pieces without heads, bones 
  or fins. Include in this weight shrimp, clams, mussels, squid and/or 
  octopus (use small ones), and whatever you have - BUT - hopefully you 
  have some whole fish so you can makes stock with the heads, bones, 
  fins (and shrimp shells). Select fish that hold together reasonably 
  well with wet cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page 
  (very big page).</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Anchovies:</h3> &nbsp; Avoid Moroccan anchovies, the quality is 
  often very poor. Italian are widely available in jars (and in cans at 
  Trader Joe's) and South American are quite good. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_anchopd.html"><b>Anchovy Products</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; If you have whole fish, 
  use the heads, fins and bones to make fish stock. Include skins only 
  if approved on our "Details and Cooking" page for that 
  particular fish (See our 
  <a href="https://clovegarden.com/ingred/seafishv.html"><b>Varieties of Fish</b></a> page). 
  Include shrimp shells (and heads if available). Bring to a boil and 
  simmer slowly 40 minutes. Strain and let settle. Use your gravy 
  separator to remove all oil. For more details on making and storing 
  stock, see our <a href="https://clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html"><b>Fish Stock</b></a> page. 
  If you cannot make stock, use water and 16 ounces of Clam Juice, and 
  perhaps 2 T of Thai Fish Sauce. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce</b></a> page.</li>
<li  id="04">
  <h3>Toast:</h3> &nbsp; IF serving over toast as is 
  done in Italy, make the soup very liquid - that 5 cups of stock should 
  be more like 7 cups. Toast will absorb a whole lot. The bread 
  should, of course, be Italian, but French will do. Slice 1/2 inch 
  thick, cut off crust. and toast in a pre-heated 357&deg;F/190&deg;C 
  oven.  Serving with toast is entirely unsuited to buffet service.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; At this point, three 
  strategies are followed depending on the effect desired. 1) I usually 
  do nothing. 2) Strain the soup, pur&eacute;e the vegetables and add 
  back. 3) Strain the soup and discard the vegetables.</li>
