This wonderful soup is perfect for <a href="yop_bnmult1.html#07"><b>Samhain</b></a>! 
Of grains, beans, grass pea and vegetables, it's an ancient harvest 
celebration dish, still very much usable today.

The name of this soup, from Latin, implies drunkenness, suggesting wild 
harvest celebrations. This version is "modernized" by adding White Beans 
and Potatoes from the New World, but some go farther and include Tomatoes.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>


<li id="01">
  <h3>Farro:</h3> &nbsp; This is an ancient form of wheat that 
  continued in use in parts of Italy due to tolerating poor soils. 
  It has now gained sufficient interest in North America to be available 
  in multi-ethnic markets, markets serving a yuppie class community, 
  and from Bob's Red Mill. For details, see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_wheat.html"><b>Wheat</b></a> page</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Pearled Wheat:</h3> &nbsp; [Pelted Wheat] &nbsp; This is whole 
  wheat grains that have had the hard husk milled off. It is especially 
  common in markets serving an Anatolian and/or Caucasian community. 
  For details, see our <a href="../ingred/gr_wheat.html"><b>Wheat</b></a> 
  page</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fava Beans:</h3> Use dried Fava beans that have been peeled, sold 
  as "Yellow Fava Beans". The unpeeled ones can take 24 hours of soaking 
  time and long cooking so don't match the other ingredients. For details 
  see our <a href="../ingred/bp_favaz.html"><b>Fava Beans</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>White Beans:</h3> &nbsp; In Italy, they use Verdolini beans 
  (Fagioli Sarconi) which are not much available in North America. I use 
  Great Northern beans which are the most available around here, and 
  they work fine. Verdolini are also New World beans. All the beans are 
  soaked in salt brine because that produces beans that cook better than 
  just soaked.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Grass Peas:</h3> &nbsp; [Cicerchie (Italy)] &nbsp; This member 
  of the Sweet Pea genus has been used in southern Italy and parts of 
  Spain since ancient times. It is now becoming fairly common in North 
  America, but usually needs to be ordered on-line. This pea is famous 
  for the crippling neurotoxins it contains, but this toxin is not a 
  problem if Grass Pea is a minor part of the diet. I very much doubt 
  the par boiling has any effect except to make the cook feel better 
  about serving a toxic pea - feel free to skip it. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/bp_grasz.html"><b>Grass Pea</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn to 
  mush with long cooking or reheating. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Samhain:</h3> &nbsp; This is the most popular celebration in the 
  Neo-Pagan calendar. Originally a harvest celebration, it was so 
  essentially Pagan, the Christian Church tried to eliminate it. They 
  failed, so they moved All Saints Day and All Souls Day to what is 
  now commonly known as "Halloween" in hopes of diluting it - but were 
  never able to erase its Pagan roots.</li>
