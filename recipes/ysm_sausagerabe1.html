<p>Italian sausages and Rapini are basic, but I often use other 
sausages and other greens. Polish sausage, Swiss chard, Turnip Greens 
(robust, a personal favorite), Mustard Greens and Chinese broccoli work 
fine in this recipe.</p>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b> (if used) into dice and <b>SAUSAGES</b> into 
    convenient chunks.</li>
  <li>Separate the <b>RAPINI</b> leaves and tender flower heads 
    from the stems. Cut really big leaves into several strips and cut 
    the stems into 2 inch lengths. Keep separate.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>
  <ol start="3">
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan with plenty of real estate for 
    tumbling greens (3-1/2 quart is perfect) heat <b>Bacon</b> (if used), 
    <b>Sausages</b> and enough <b>Water</b> to be about 1/8" deep. 
    Cook uncovered over moderate heat until water has evaporated completely 
    and some fat has rendered. Continue to fry the sausages, stiring 
    frequently until they are lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Pour off excess fat - if any - you need enough to coat the greens. 
    Stir in <b>Water</b> and <b>Rapini Stems</b>. Simmer covered until stems 
    are nearly done (about 5 minutes). Stir in the <b>Rapini Leaves</b> and 
    simmer covered until tender (about 3 minutes). 
    There should be some free liquid left at completion, adjust as needed.
    </li>
  <li>Serve with plain Pasta or Rice, or as a breakfast, side dish or 
    appetizer.</li>
    </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; If you know your sausage won't 
  render enough fat a little fatty bacon will be needed.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rapini</h3> &nbsp; (Broccoli Rabe, Raab) This green is easy 
  to find in markets catering to a Medeterranian population, or use one 
  of the other greens mentioned above.</li>
