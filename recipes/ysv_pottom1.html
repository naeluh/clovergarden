A delicious dish of lightly fried potatoes with tomatoes for sauce. 
Easy to make on the stove top and even easier in an electric skillet 
(11x11 inch for 1 recipe, 11x16 inch for a double recipe).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (25 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes about 3/4 inch on a side. 
    Hold in cold water until needed.
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.
  <li>Drain <b>TOMATOES</b> reserving all liquid. Chop coarse. Return 
    to liquid.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b> very well. Dry on a towel if possible.</li>
  <li>Heat <b>Butter</b> and <b>Olive Oil</b>. Fry <b>Onions</b> stirring 
    until translucent. Stir in Potatoes and fry stirring often until 
    they are lightly colored (electric skillet 300&deg;F/148&deg;C).</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> with their juice. Season with <b>Salt</b>,  
    <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Rosemary</b>.</li>
  <li>Cover and simmer until Potatoes are tender all the way through 
    (electric skillet about 212&deg;F/100&deg;C so it goes on and off 
    with intermittent boiling). If the sauce gets too thick, add a little 
    boiling water.</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and serve hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar 
  work well in recipes of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes 
  - they quickly turn to mush with long cooking. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rosemary:</h3> &nbsp; This should be fresh. It 
  wasn't called for in the pattern recipe (that recipe called for a 
  pinch of saffron) but I felt it was needed. You can use other fresh 
  herbs such as oregano or thyme, add at least half again as much as 
  for the rosemary. Of course, I also added a touch of crushed hot 
  chili - perhaps not authentic, but I live in Southern California 
  and it just seemed to need it. If you do use <b>Saffron</b>, soak it 
  in a little water for awhile before adding it (with the water).</li>
