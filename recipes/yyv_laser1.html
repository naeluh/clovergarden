A problem reconstructing recipes from Imperial Roman is that an important 
flavoring is extinct - the giant fennel called laser (Greek silphium). 
For the resin we use asafoetida, just as the Romans did by Nero's day - 
inferior, but available. 

</td><td><br></td>
<tr><td class=top colspan="5">
What about stems, roots and juice which were 
also used?  With only a few hints on flavor, this is my take on faking 
it up - and it works rather well. Unfortunately I don't know any 1st 
century Romans who could test it for accuracy. Start with about 1/2 
teaspoon per cup of sauce and adjust to your taste.

  <b><u>Make:</b></u> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Chop <b>FENNEL</b> small and run in a food processor with the sharp 
   blade until as close to liquified as you can get it. Add a little water 
   if needed so it processes well.</li>
  <li>Wrap <b>Fennel Paste</b> in a muslin cloth and wring it out hard, 
    retaining all the liquid. Discard the dry, almost flavorless pulp.
    </li>
  <li>In a saucepan large enough to hold the fennel juice, bring 
    <b>Oil</b> up fairly hot but well before smoking. Take it off the 
    heat and stir in the <b>Asafoetida</b> for just a few seconds until 
    the foam subsides, then pour in the fennel juice. See 
    <a href="yyv_laser1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Put the pan over moderate heat and simmer down until a little less 
    than 1/4 cup of liquid remains. Put up in a small jar and refrigerate 
    until needed.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Fennel:</b> &nbsp; Wild fennel stems would 
  probably be better, but I use what I can get - Florence fennel (often 
  sold as "anise"). Buy from a market that leaves the stems long. The 
  ones I buy are 14 inches long counting bulbs and stems.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Asafoetida:</b> &nbsp; Use ayurvedic grade pure 
  powdered asafoetida if possible. Indian market "hing powder" is cut to 
  30% with rice flour and gum arabic. Alternately crush pure resin 
  (available in some Indian markets) into powder.   See our 
  <a href="../ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page for more 
  information.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Hot Oil:</b> &nbsp; Asafoetida has a sulfurous 
  stink very like SAE 90 Weight Hypoid Gear Oil - not a characteristic of 
  silphium. The brief frying in hot oil (standard practice in India) 
  tempers this odor.</li>
