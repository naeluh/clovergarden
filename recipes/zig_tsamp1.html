Tsampa is the most important staple used by the Tibetan people. It is 
filling, healthy, and easily transportable, fully cooked, and needs only 
a little Butter Tea and a touch of salt to make it ready to eat.

  <br>Barley (<a href="zig_tsamp1.html#01">1</a>)  &nbsp;

<p>Our recipe is adapted from The Lhasa Moon Tibetan Cookbook, and is 
suitable for making small quantities in a modern kitchen, rather than 
preparing huge quantities outdoors (see <a href="zig_tsamp1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>).
</p>
<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8 hrs)
<ol>
<li>Soak <b>BARLEY</b> overnight with plenty of water.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs - 50 min work)
<ol start="2">
<li>Drain the <b>Barley</b> very well. Spread it out on paper towels 
  on a baking sheet or similar and let it dry until it is just damp, 
  not wet. You can pull the paper towels at about half way.</li>
<li>Heat a kadhai, wok or spacious skillet over high heat. Stir in 1/4 
  of the <b>Barley</b>. Fry it, stirring, not quite constantly, but every 
  few seconds. A surface temperature of about 440&deg;F/230&deg;C is 
  good. The Barley will eventually start to sound like sand. You can 
  chew a couple grains, and they should be crisp all the way through. 
  Let it darken a little, but no more than to a dark blonde color. You 
  may want to turn the heat down to moderate at this point as the 
  color darkens quickly, and you definitely don't want any burn. Pour it 
  out to cool, and Repeat with the other 3 quarters. You will notice 
  the toasted barley tastes really good.</li>
<li>When the <b>Barley</b> is completely cooled, grind it fine in a 
  grain grinder or coffee mill. If you use your regular coffee mill, 
  clean it by grinding some rice before and after.</li>
<li>Store in a sealed container away from heat and sunlight.</li>
</ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; This needs to be light brown, very lightly 
  pearled barley, not the white excessively pearled barley found in 
  North American supermarkets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_barlz.html"><b>Barley</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The traditional method of making Tsampa (still 
  widely used today) takes all day. After soaking 25 pounds or more of 
  Barley, it is mixed in batches with hot fine sand in a large wok over a 
  hot wood fire and stirred continuously. The sand assures even toasting 
  in a large batch, and is sifted out and returned to the wok for the 
  next batch. The Barley is then sealed into a big cotton bag and 
  severely abused with sticks. After this, it is sifted in the wind so 
  all chaff is blown away. Finally, it is ground in an industrial 
  grinder. Full details are found in Tibetan Cooking, Elizabeth Esther 
  Kelly.</li>
