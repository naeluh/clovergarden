This is really delicious, and with just rice makes a meal. The original 
recipe is reported to have been collected by Susanne Waugh from the royal 
court of Bhutan. I have made some practical changes - see 
 <a href="zmm_pigchoy1.html#01"><b>Notes</b></a>.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min) 
  <ol>
  <li>Remove excess fat from <b>PORK</b> and cut into pieces 1/2 inch by 
    1/2 inch and as long as practical for your cut.</li>  
  <li>Cut <b>DRIED PORK</b> into strips 1/2 inch wide and about 1/8 inch 
    thick by whatever length works.</li>
  <li>Wash <b>BOK CHOY</b> and separate leaves from stems. Cut leaves into 
    1/2 inch strips and stems diagonally about 3/8 inch wide, discarding 
    pieces that are overly thick. Keep leaves and stems separate.</li>    
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>DAIKON</b> and slice a little less than 1/4 inch thick. If 
    slices are large, cut them in half.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine,</li>
  <li>Cap <b>CHILI</b>, split in half lengthwise and cut into narrow 
    strips. Scrape out seeds or not depending on your preference.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-3/4 hrs)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>In a wok or spacious saut&eacute; pan melt <b>Butter</b> over moderate 
    heat and fry <b>Onion</b> until translucent. Stir in <b>Pork</b> and 
    fry stirring until all raw color is gone and any exuded liquid has 
    evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Water</b>, <b>Daikon</b>, <b>Chili Powder</b> and <b>Salt</b>. 
    Bring to a boil and simmer covered until the pork is just tender - an 
    hour to an hour and a half depending on your cut of pork. Check now 
    and then to make sure you don't run out of water.</li> 
  <li>Stir in <b>Bok Choy Stems</b>, bring back to a simmer and cook for 
    about 2 minutes. Stir in the <b>Bok Choy Leaves</b> and simmer for 
    another 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Chili</b>, <b>Ginger</b> and <b>Dried Pork</b>. See that 
    there's enough liquid, cover and simmer for another 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Adjust liquid to your preference and serve hot with plenty of 
    Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with all 
  excess fat removed. Pork shoulder (Boston Butt or Picnic Shoulder) or 
  similar are fine. The original recipe called for strips "6 by 1/2 inch",
  thickness unspecified. This seems a little impractical so I favor about 
  3 inches long..</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Dried Cured Pork:</h3> &nbsp; This is a standard item 
  in Bhutan, but not likely available at your local supermarket. It is 
  said to add "sweetness", so I used 
  "Chinese Style Cured and Smoked Ham Pieces" which is quite dry and 
  fairly sweet. Chinese Bacon would probably also work, or lacking 
  even that, Chinese Sausages. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/ap_chhamz.html"><b>Chinese Cured Smoked Ham</b></a> 
  page and our <a href="../ingred/ap_baconcz.html">
  <b>Chinese Bacon</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bok Choy</h3> &nbsp; Use small heads of white stemmed 
  Bok Choy. The original recipe called for 3 pounds of large heads because 
  only the leaves were used and the stems discarded. That's fine for the 
  royal court, but we peasants aren't likely to throw away all that 
  perfectly good bok choy.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Daikon:</h3> &nbsp; Select a small daikon. Large ones seem fine 
  eaten raw, but can be unpleasantly fibrous when cooked in a stew.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; Bhutanese chilis are said to be both 
  meaty and very hot. Serranos are probably as close as we can get here. 
  One seeds-in serrano won't make a recipe of this size very hot. With 
  the seeds and membranes stripped out it will contribute almost no heat - 
  use your own best judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page. </li>
<li id="06">
  <b>Chili Powder</b> &nbsp; This provides both flavor and heat. I use 
  Indian Reshampatti which has good flavor and is fairly hot, but not 
  unreasonable. If you want less hot use Kashmir or Korean - use your 
  own judgement. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/cp_indiz.html"><b>Indian Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
