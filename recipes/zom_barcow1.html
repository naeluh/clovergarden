This is a substantial Tibetan soup with a good mix of flavors and 
textures. I have made a number of changes to the pattern recipe, all in 
keeping with Tibetan practice, as explained in 
<a href="zom_barcow1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>.

<b><u>Do Ahead</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6 hrs - 3 min work)

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol start="2">
<li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> thin and cut into strips about 1-1/4 inches long 
  and 3/4 inch wide.</li>
<li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> to a size similar to the Beef.</li>

<li>Drain the <b>Barley</b>. Place in a 3-qt Saucepan along with

<li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a skillet or saut&eacute; pan, heat 
  <b>Olive Oil</b> and fry <b>Garlic mix</b> until threatening to 
  color. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until it has completely

<li>At the 45 minute mark, stir <b>Beef mix</b> into the pot along with 
  <b>Chili Flake</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Simmer another 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Check seasoning and add Water if needed. Just before serving, stir 
  in Chard and bring to a boil. Simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve Hot.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Barley:</h3> &nbsp; This should be light brown, very lightly 
  pearled barley, not the white excessively pearled barley found in 
  North American supermarkets. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/gr_barlz.html"><b>Barley</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer Chuck, which is more tender than the 
  Top Round called for by the pattern recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; In Tibet these would be harvested wild, 
  but Tibetans outside Tibet often use Oyster Mushrooms. I very much 
  favor the small King Trumpet Oyster Mushrooms now commonly available 
  in Southern California Asian markets, though the big ones would also 
  work, cut a little thinner. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/fungus.html#oyster"><b>Fungus</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Chard:</h3> &nbsp; [Swiss Chard] &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 
  for "Spinach", but &Uuml;ber expert Julie Sahni assures us that our 
  Spinach is not grown in the Indian Subcontinent, and that Chard 
  is much closer to what is called "Spinach" there.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Bouillon Cube</h3> &nbsp; A Beef cube is preferred. Bouillon Cubes 
  are much used in regions that lack refrigeration of sufficient capacity 
  to store soup stock, and are also much favored by European chefs, but 
  you can use stock if you have it on hand.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>Chili Flake</h3> &nbsp; I use Indian Khandela or Reshampatti, which 
  are fairly hot. Korean would be less hot. Use the type you want in 
  the amount you prefer. For details see our 
  <a href="../ingred/chilip.html"><b>Chili Powder / Flake</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Changes:</h3> &nbsp; I have made substantial changes from the 
  pattern recipe, other than using Chard instead of "Spinach". All are 
  in keeping with other Tibetan recipes in my posession. Most important: 
  the recipe called for "12 dried black mushrooms". This seemed excessive, 
  and did overwhelm the recipe. I call for the fresh Oyster Mushrooms 
  many Tibetan expats use in place of Tibetan Sesha mushrooms. This 
  worked very well. Oddly, the recipe stirs in the Garlic mix at the 
  midpoint "with the Olive Oil". Olive Oil isn't in the ingredients list. 
  Other Tibetan recipes fry the garlic / ginger mix in oil before adding 
  to soups or stews, so I presume a missing step. I used a little Olive 
  Oil to fry the Garlic mix until softened, then stirred in the Beef and 
  fried it. This I added to the soup at the midway step, and it worked 
  well.</li>
