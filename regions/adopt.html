<h1>Western Adoption <small>of</small> Asian Food</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg>Asian ingredients have become easily available and 
economical in much of the US and Europe, Asian cooking methods are now 
well known and Asian flavors increasingly familiar and accepted. Once 
confined to ethnic restaurants, Asian food is increasingly prepared in 
our homes, often with great attention to authenticity.</span>

<p><span class=bg>Context, presentation and portioning of Asian food are 
another matter entirely. About the only concession we ever make to 
authenticity is to provide chopsticks when serving Chinese or Japanese 
dishes.</span>

<p>When we Westerners adopt Asian recipes, we often replicate the recipe 
with great accurately, but the context in which it is served will likely 
not be at all authentic. The number of "sides" to the rice or bread is 
usually much reduced, often even to just one. Consequently the portions 
will be much larger and stand at least equal to the bread or rice. If a 
recipe includes meat we tend to up the amount substantially, from a 
flavoring element to a main ingredient.</p>

<p>Asian restaurants in the West tend to go too far in this direction 
because they think we expect it. They generally provide over-size 
portions and just a tiny bowl of rice, or even none, when rice should 
be the center of the meal. You should take care not to do this at home.
</p>

<p>Asian seating arrangements are generally very uncomfortable for us, so 
we eat Asian dishes sitting at our high table and using our customary 
plates and utensils, perhaps with chopsticks added. The meal is even 
likely to be presented "Russian service" (food portioned to plates before 
they are brought to the table) and served in courses rather than all at 
once.</p>

<p>In truth, replicating Asian service is quite difficult for us. We might 
pull it off for some special occasion but not on a daily basis. In Asia an 
extended family has been the norm, all sitting down to the meal together. 
Resources are pooled so the family can afford at least one person who does 
almost nothing but cook all day. Further, children help with simpler 
tasks and in many regions any family that could actually afford food could 
afford servants to prepare it.</p>

<p>In the West, our insular families generally consist of just a man and a 
woman, or now often just one or the other, plus one or more obstinate, 
demanding, unruly and unhelpful children. Servants? You gotta be kidding. 
Given all the other responsibilities of work and running a household it's 
clearly a task to get just a couple dishes to the table, never mind a half 
dozen or more.</p>

<p>In much of Asia eating utensils other than fingers are practically 
unknown. India, for instance, lacks even spoons, which explains why soups 
are not served in India, except where Westerners gather. Knives never 
appear on an Asian table. Thailand, the only country in Asia that never 
fell to European rule, is the only one to adopt the fork and spoon - but 
the fork is used only to load the spoon. Thais, incidentally, use 
chopsticks only for noodle dishes which they regard as Chinese, despite 
loading them up with fish sauce and hot chilis.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, Asian recipes on clovegarden.com, while as 
faithful as practical in taste and ingredients, are proportioned and 
adjusted for a Western style service. In some cases the larger serving 
dictates lessening the intensity of a dish, but the original seasoning 
will be noted.</p>

<p>One feature of Asian presentation should always be adhered to, for 
authenticity and because it affects flavor and texture. Since there are 
never knives on the Asian table (makes assassination too easy), all food 
is cut to bite size in the kitchen, usually before cooking, or cooked 
to the point it breaks apart easily.</p>

<p>Another feature is insistence on freshness. While most associated with 
southeastern China where it's hard to sell anything that isn't verifiably 
alive and healthy, it's endemic throughout Asia. In India shopping 
is done twice a day to assure the vegetables are fresh. Our refrigeration 
partly alleviates this but is often negated by long transportation. Always 
buy and use fresh for Asian recipes, preferably from local sources, and use 
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Actually, except for knives at the table and much ruder manners, 
a very similar dining environment prevailed in Europe, until the rise of 
modern cities and the beginning industrialization. This included extended 
families, servants, the central place of bread, and eating with the 
fingers. The fork didn't make it to France until the 1300s, to England 
until 1611, to Colonial America until 1630. Using it was long denounced 
by the Church as an insult to God, who gave us fingers to eat with.</p>

<p>The last shreds of the old system are seen in the service called 
"family style" in the U.S. and "European service" elsewhere. In the U.S. 
we see this mainly at traditional Thanksgiving dinners - in all else 
the Russian service rules.</p>

<p>All this changed for very real reasons, and as Asians take ever more 
out-sourcing work from us and do ever more of our manufacturing, they 
necessarily adopt Western ways. The Russian service that made Western 
restaurants practical is increasingly taking hold, as are Western based 
restaurant chains. Time is becoming ever more precious as well, and 
extended families are breaking up to take work in the cities just as 
they did in Europe.</p>

<p>Within a few decades, the norm for much of Asia will be eating just a 
few dishes at a high table with knives, spoons and forks, just as we do. 
In Japan there has been much grumbling that the younger folks are 
unable to use chopsticks.</p>
