<p>Rice in Laos and Issan Thailand is Thai Sticky Rice. This is a long grain 
rice, unlike all other Sticky Rice (Sweet Rice, Glutinous Rice) varieties, 
which are short grain, and they are not interchangeable. This rice is 
cooked much differently than other rice, and is served differently. These 
baskets may be for a single place, or large ones could be for a table. The 
deep lid forms a double wall to keep the rice warm. </p>

<p>For details on cooking this kind of rice, see our

Sweet Rice</b></a> section.</p>
