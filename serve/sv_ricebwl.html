This is the traditional style of rice serving bowl, carved from wood. I 
purchased it probably in the late 1970s. These are made in a range of sizes, 
the photo example being 7-1/8 inches (18 cm). About 15 years later I saw 
some for sale and was shocked by the price being asked by then. Today, 
plastic imitations are sold.
