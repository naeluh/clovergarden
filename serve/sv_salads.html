This photo is of my favorite Salad Bowl, made of wood an 7-3/4 inches 
diameter (20 cm). I have 6 of them. 

<p><b>Funny, Funny!</b> &nbsp;  Back in the 1960s some food commentator 
advised that in France, they never wash their wooden salad bowls, but let 
them become infused with rancid Olive Oil, which would slightly flavor the 
salads. This was, of course, a joke. The French don't even use wooden salad 
bowls, preferring ceramics. The commentator was influential enough that many 
would-be foodies actually believed him, and passed the advice along.</p>

<p>Persons in the know saw no need to correct this impression, so it hung 
around for years. Myself, being a dish washing freak, and enjoying the fresh 
flavor of ExtV Olive Oil, I simply rejected this advice without checking its 
validity - I'm not French anyway.</p>

<h2>Salad Serving Bowl <small>&amp;</small> Buffet Tongs</h2>

In this photo is my ancient teak Salad Serving Bowl, used for leafy green 
salads. It has a capacity of 4 quarts (3.8 litre). Also shown are Buffet 
Tongs, which I highly favor for serving salads, as only one hand is 
necessary. This is especially important if serving at a party buffet. Note 
the tongs have a spoon on one side and a slotted spoon on the other, so you 
can control the amount of dressing you take.

<p>For Cucumber Salads and similar, I use a ceramic serving bowl, often one 
on a pedestal so it doesn't take up too much table space. Also, these salads 
will usually be portioned out with a serving spoon rather than with tongs.

For eating Leafy Green Salads, I find Chinese style Chopsticks to be by far 
the most efficient utensil. Developing chopstick skills is very beneficial.
For Cucumber Salads and other more solid salads, I use a Salad Fork.
