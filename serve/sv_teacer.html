This iron kettle was designed to serve hot water for tea in a Tea Ceremony 
(Chado) setting. This is a very formal and structured event, preferably in a 
purpose constructed tea house, or at least a separate room used only for the 
Tea Ceremony. Actually, it can be performed outdoors, but still in a very 
structured setting. The environment, all items used, and the behavior of the 
host and guests are prescribed in detail. The rules were pretty much 
solidified during the 1400s by Zen Buddhist monks.

<p>I did not purchase this set. It was purchased, probably in the 1980s by 
a friend, who was a bit strange, and a bit unstable. It was given to me by 
his sister, along with some other Japanese items, some time after his self 
inflicted demise. His Japanese period may have been over by then, as he did 
not attempt a formal seppuku.</p>
