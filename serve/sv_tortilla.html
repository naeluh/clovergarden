<h1>Tortilla / Chapati Warmer</h1>
<br><img src="img/sv_tortilla02d.jpg" alt="Fabric Tortilla Warmer" class=mrg>

<p>This item is very useful here in the Southwest of the United States, but 
may be less important in the Frozen North. There are many different 
types made from ceramic and plastic, but testers have found the 
insulated fabric type to be far more effective than any of the others. 
It's also easier to store when not in use. The photo specimen, which can 
hold tortillas up to 10 inches diameter, was purchased from 
www.latortillaoven.com, where many designs are available.</p>

<p>The fabric tortilla warmer (and some other kinds) can be filled with 
tortillas and heated in a microwave oven, but you are limited as to 
how many at a time, depending on the moisture content of the tortillas. 
If much steam is generated, they tend to come apart and stick to each 
other. For more details on warming tortillas, see below.
</p>
<p>This warmer is just fine for Indian chapatis also. Here in Southern 
California, whole wheat tortillas and commercial chapatis are pretty 
much identical, and are made on the same equipment. Indian women here 
don't have time to develop the traditional skill of rolling out perfectly 
round chapatis by hand, so Indian markets sell tortilla presses for 
that.

<h3>Warming Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Microwave:</b> &nbsp; Place a stack of 5 tortillas (not more) 
  on a microwave plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave in 
  30 second bursts until they are thoroughly warmed. Some recommend 
  interleaving tortillas with paper towels so you can do a bigger 
  stack.<p></li>
<li><p><b>Oven:</b> &nbsp; Wrap a stack of 5 tortillas (not more, or 
  there will be too much steam) in aluminum foil. Place in a 
  350&deg;/175&deg;C oven for about 15 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Stovetop:</b> &nbsp; Heat an unoiled comal or tava very hot. 
  Fry 20 to 30 seconds on a side. This method will get you a few browned 
  spots. It works best with very fresh tortillas.</p></li>
