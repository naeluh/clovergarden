These pictured are the traditional Chinese table place utensils. As you 
can see, Chinese chopsticks are much thicker and longer than Japanese  
examples. This gives the Chinese more flexibility with rice, but it still 
needs to be a little sticky. There should also be a Chopstick Rest at each 
table place. The spoon normally used is of the Chinese ceramic pattern, and 
the one shown was made in China.

<p>All foods are cut to bite size in the kitchen, and knives are never found 
at the table. That would make assassination far too easy and less entertaining.
